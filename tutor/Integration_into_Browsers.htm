<DIV>If you want to change Browser Integration options, you will need to go to 
IDM Options by pressing Options button on IDM toolbar.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>On&nbsp;File Types Tab&nbsp;you can change file types that will be taken over 
from a browser and downloaded by IDM. IDM integrates into Internet Explorer, 
Opera, MSN Explorer, AOL, Netscape,&nbsp;Mozilla, Mozilla Firebird, Mozilla 
Firefox, MyIE2, Avant Browser, NetCaptor, GoSurf, Fast Browser, SlimBrowser, and 
many other popular browsers&nbsp;by default. Even if you don't see your browser 
in the list, IDM may add&nbsp;the browser&nbsp;once you start a download in 
it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If you want to turn off the integration into a specific browser, please 
uncheck the corresponding box in "Intergrate IDM into browsers" list.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>You can disable IDM to download from specified sites. If you don't want IDM
to take over all downloads from a particular site, you may add it to the list
not to start downloading automatically. You may use asterisk to match any number
of characters. For example *.tonec.com will match
ftp.tonec.com,&nbsp;www.tonec.com,&nbsp;www.games.tonec.com,&nbsp;and etc.</DIV>

IDM will take over the download from this application and add&nbsp;the
application&nbsp;to the list of browsers.</DIV><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face="Times New Roman">
