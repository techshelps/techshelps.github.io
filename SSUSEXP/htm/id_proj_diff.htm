Compares a VSS project with another VSS project, a VSS project with a Windows folder, or two Windows folders, then shows the differences, if any. You can also see individual line differences in differing files, and reconcile differences between the projects.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></B>If you want to show differences between a file in your project and that file in another VSS project or a Windows folder, select a file in the <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_filepane">file pane</a> of <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_vssexplorer">VSS Explorer</a>, and then click <b>Show Differences</b>.</p>
<h4>Access Rights</h4>
<p>
You must have the Read <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_accessrights">access right</a> to use this command.</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The <b>Show Differences</b> command on a project generates a two-paned dialog box that lists the differences between a VSS project and another VSS project, a VSS project and a Windows folder, or two Windows folders. Before the lists of files are displayed, a command dialog box comes up that allows you to filter the file list if you'd like, so you can limit reporting to the files that interest you.</p>
<p>
A common use of this command is to find the files another user has deleted from the project, so you can delete them from your working folder. It can also be useful if you take a project home for a while, to see if any project-level changes have been made.</p>
<p>
If you are comparing a VSS project and a Windows folder, you can reconcile differences between the two projects in several ways. For example, you can get or check in all files that are different in each respective project, or you can also add missing files.</p>
<h3>Project Difference Dialog Box Options</h3>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></B>Enable the display of the <b>Show Differences</b> dialog box on the <b>Tools</b> menu,<b> SourceSafe Options</b> dialog box, <b>Command Dialogs</b> tab.</p>
<p>
The options in this dialog box are not mutually exclusive <img src="emdash.gif" border=0> they can be combined to filter the file lists in each pane. Each one of the check boxes below potentially adds more files to the lists in each pane.</p>
<h4>Compare / To</h4>
<p>
If you are performing a routine project difference, by default the <b>Compare</b> field will contain the project in VSS and the <b>To</b> field will contain its counterpart in the working folder. You can edit the <b>Compare</b> field, or you can click the <b>Browse</b> button to specify your selection. Using the <b>Browse</b> buttons, you can compare two projects in VSS (in the same project or other projects), two local projects (in the same directory or different directories), or a project in VSS and a local project. </p>
<h4>Show files that are only in the project</h4>
<p>
Includes, in the left pane, project files that are not currently in the working folder. This option is selected by default.</p>
<h4>Show files that are only in the working folder</h4>
<p>
Includes working folder files that are not currently in the VSS project. This option is selected by default.</p>
<h4>Show files that are different in both places</h4>
<p>
Includes all files that are in both the working folder and VSS project, but are different from each other. Most often for these files, you need to get the file to update the version in your working folder. This option is selected by default.</p>
<h4>Show files that are the same in both places</h4>
<p>
Includes files in both projects that are the same in both places.&nbsp; This option is selected by default.</p>
<h4>Recursive</h4>
<p>
Scans the contents of either the <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_currentproject">current project</a> or Windows folder and all its <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_subproject">subprojects</a>; shows all differences between the two respective projects or Windows folders.</p>
<h4>Only show this dialog when the shift key is down</h4>
<p>
If this box is checked, the Show Differences dialog will only be displayed if you hold down the Shift key while executing the <b>Show Differences</b> command.</p>
