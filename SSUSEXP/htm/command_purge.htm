Permanently removes previously deleted files and projects from the <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_vssdatabase">VSS database</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p class=label>
<b>To use the Purge command:</b>
<ol>
<li>
Select a project in the <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_projectpane">project pane</a> of <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_vssexplorer">VSS Explorer</a>.<br><br></li>
<li>
On the <b>File</b> menu, click <b>Properties</b>, and then click the <b>Deleted Items</b> tab.<br><br></li>
<li>
Click <b>Purge</b>.&nbsp; You receive a warning message, because you can't undo a <b>Purge</b> command.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Access Rights</h4>
<p>
You must have the <b>Destroy</b> <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_accessrights">access right</a> to use this command.</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
When you use the <b>Delete</b> command to delete files or projects from VSS, the deleted items are removed from VSS Explorer.&nbsp; However, VSS continues to store the items so that you can recover them <img src="emdash.gif" border=0> and, for example, rebuild earlier versions of the project that required them.</p>
<p>
To permanently delete these files from the VSS database <img src="emdash.gif" border=0> and free up the disk space they are using <img src="emdash.gif" border=0> use the <b>Purge</b> command.</p>
<p>
When you purge a previously deleted file from a project, the file is permanently removed from the project, and cannot be recovered.&nbsp; Consequently, if you use the <b>Get Latest Version</b> command to get any version of the project that contained that file, the file can't be found.&nbsp; For this reason, the <b>Purge</b> command should be used with extreme caution: You must be confident that you will never want this file or project, or any of its earlier versions, for any reason.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></B>The purpose of purging is to get rid of obsolete files and thereby free up disk space.&nbsp; However, the <b>Purge</b> command may not always have that effect.&nbsp; If a file is being shared by more than one project, and you purge it in one project, no disk space is freed up, because the file is still being used.&nbsp; Only if you purge the file in all the projects that are using it is the file permanently deleted from your VSS database.</p>
