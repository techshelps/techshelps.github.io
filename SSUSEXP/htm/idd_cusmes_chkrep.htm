<p>
This message has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
You chose to get a file when it was already checked out.<p class=tl>
When you get a file, a new copy is written to your working folder. If you already have the file checked out, you may have made changes that will be overwritten. In this situation, VSS gives you some options:</P><ul type=disc>
<li>
Click <b>Replace</b> to overwrite the working folder file.<br><br></li>
<li>
Click <b>Merge</b> to merge changes from the working folder file into the VSS database file.<br><br></li>
<li>
Click <b>Leave</b> to leave the working folder file alone (the <b>Get</b> command will be ignored for that file).<br><br></li>
<li>
Click <b>Cancel</b> to cancel the Get operation.<br><br></li>
<li>
Click <b>Apply to all items</b> to have your choices in this dialog box apply to all other files you currently have checked out. </li>
</ul>
