<p>
This message has the following cause and solution:
<ul>
<li>
VSS couldn't save the files that you want to add, and they contain unsaved changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The VSS operation may have failed, you may not have add rights in this project, or you could have run out of memory.  Save your files manually and try again.  If that fails, check your VSS connection and try again.</p>
