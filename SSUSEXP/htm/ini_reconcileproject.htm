<p>
Determines default behavior when reconciling differences between projects with the Show Differences command. </p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
<b>Reconcile_Project </b>= <i>{Get|Ignore, Delete from folder|Recover deleted file|Add to project|Ignore, Add to project|Ignore, Check In|Undo Check Out|Get|Ignore, Get|Ignore}</i></p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
Instructs VSS to use the normal default behaviors for reconciling project differences in the Reconcile All Differences dialog box:</p>
<p>
<code>Reconcile_Project = Get, Delete, Add, Check In, Get</code></p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Changing this variable allows you to customize the default choices in the Reconcile All Differences dialog box. The setting for this variable are used when you specify the -F option for the Project Difference command line command.</p>
<p>
The first three settings are to specify behavior for reconciling files that appear in only one list:</p>
<p class=tl>
<b>For files that are not in your working folder.</b>  This specifies what you want to happen when VSS finds files that are not in your working folder, but are in the project.&nbsp; Specify Get (the default) to get files missing from your working folder. Specify Ignore to take no action with these files.</P><p class=tl>
<b>Files that are deleted in the project.</b> This specifies what you want to happen when VSS finds files that are in your working folder, but have been deleted in the project.&nbsp; Specify Delete from folder (the default) to delete these files from your working folder.&nbsp; Specify Recover delted file to recover the deleted file and place a copy in your working folder.&nbsp; Specify Add to project to add these files back to your project. Specify Ignore to take no action with these files.</P><p class=tl>
<b>Files that are not in the project at all.</b> This specifies what you want to happen when VSS finds files that are not in your project, but are in your working folder.&nbsp; Specify Add to Project (the default) to add these files to your VSS project.&nbsp; Specify Ignore to take no action with these files.</P><p>
The last two settings specify behavior for reconciling files that appear in both lists:</p>
<p class=tl>
<b>Files that you have checked out.</b> This specifies what you want to happen when VSS finds files that are checked out to you, and are different in your working folder.&nbsp; Specify Check In (the default) to check these files into your VSS project. Specify Undo Check Out to undo the check out on these files.&nbsp; Specify Get Latest Version to overwrite your checked out file with a read-only copy (losing any changes you may have made).&nbsp; Specify Ignore to take no action with these files.</P><p class=tl>
<b>Files that you do not have checked out.</b> This specifies what you want to happen when VSS finds files that are not out to you, but are different in your working folder.&nbsp; Specify Get Latest Version (the default) to get the latest version of these files. Specify Ignore to take no action with these files.</P></BODY>
