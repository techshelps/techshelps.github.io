<h1><a name="ers_cannot_use_wildcards"></a>You cannot use wildcards with this command</h1>
<p>
Many VSS commands accept <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_wildcardcharacters">wildcard characters</a>, such as <b>*</b> and <b>?</b>. But some commands, such as the <b>View</b> command, can operate on only one item at a time. This error has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The command you have chosen does not accept wildcard characters.<p class=tl>
Use an explicit file name, with no wildcard characters.</P></li>
</ul>
