<p>
Sets options relating to the types of files you store in VSS.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>To display the File Types tab:</b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
On the <b>Tools</b> menu, click <b>Options</b>, and then click <b>File Types</b>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Access Rights</h4>
<p>
Any VSS user can use this tab.</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Many of the VSS dialog boxes contain file lists to let you select multiple files for a specific operation.&nbsp; Use this tab to filter these file lists so that they are more meaningful to the type of work you do.&nbsp; For example, if you are a C++ developer, you may want to store .CPP, .H, .RC, and .BMP files in VSS.&nbsp; If you are a Visual Basic developer, on the other hand, you may want to store .VBP and .FRM files instead.&nbsp; You can use this tab to restrict the file lists to display just these file types rather than all the files in a specific folder.</p>
<p>
<b>Tab Options</b></p>
<h4>Binary Files</h4>
<p>
Overrides VSS's automatic detection of text and binary files, so that you can indicate that certain file types are always binary.&nbsp; For example, you can enter *.OBJ, *.XLS, *.FRX in this box to specify that all object files, Microsoft Excel worksheets, and Visual Basic .FRX files should always be treated as binary files.</p>
<h4>Create SCC File</h4>
<p>
This box is useful only for Visual Basic users. When you work with a Visual Basic project in VSS, a special file is created in your working folder called MSSCCPRJ.SCC.&nbsp; This file can never be added to VSS: it stays in your working folder and stores important information used by the VSS integration in Visual Basic.</p>
<p>
Create SCC File dictates when VSS creates this file.&nbsp; Its default setting (*.VBP, *.MAK) means that whenever you get or add a file with an extension of .VBP (Visual Basic 4.0 project file) or .MAK (used by older versions of Visual Basic), VSS creates the MSSCCPRJ.SCC file.&nbsp; This file is very important because without it, VSS integration inside Visual Basic will not function properly.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Visual C++ and other development environments do not use this file at all.&nbsp; You may not want this useless file appearing in your Visual C++ folder.&nbsp; To prevent the appearance of the MSSCCPRJ.SCC file in your Visual C++ folder, remove the *.MAK from this field.&nbsp; (You should make this change only if you do not use Visual Basic 3.0 .MAK files!)</p>
<h4>File Groups</h4>
<p>
Together with the <b>"File types included in file group"</b> option, this option groups file types into logical groups.&nbsp; These groups are displayed in the <b>List Files of Type</b> options in many VSS dialog boxes, so you can specify groups that filter the file list efficiently for your work.</p>
<p>
Use the <b>Add</b> button to add a new group of file extensions to the list, and the <b>Delete</b> button to delete the currently selected group.&nbsp; The following example would create file groups including .FRM files, .BAS files, but explicitly not the HELP.FRM file:</p>
<pre><code>*.frm; *.bas; !HELP.FRM
</code></pre>
<p>
The &lt;Relevant Masks&gt; file group is a special case.&nbsp; This group cannot be deleted, and indicates which files you would typically place into a project.&nbsp; This does not prevent you from placing other files into the project; however, it does have several potentially useful effects.
<ol>
<li>
If you add an entire folder into VSS in one command (by typing ss add * on the VSS command line, or dragging a folder from File Manager into VSS), only files matching the relevant masks are added.&nbsp; Other files can then be added individually.<br><br></li>
<li>
When you perform the VSS<b> Show Differences</b> command on a project level to compare the current project to your working folder, files that do not match the relevant masks are not displayed as differences.<br><br></li>
<li>
The relevant masks are used as the default option under <b>Add Files of Type</b> in the <b>Add Files</b> dialog box; therefore, by default, only these files are displayed.</li>
</ol>
<h4>File Types Included In File Group</h4>
<p>
Shows the list of file types (extensions) included in the currently selected file group under <b>File Groups</b>.&nbsp; To modify a specific group, select the group under <b>File Groups</b>, and then add or delete extensions.</p>
<h4>Add</h4>
<p>
Adds a new group of file extensions to the <b>File Groups</b> list.</p>
<h4>Delete</h4>
<p>
Deletes the currently selected <b>File Group</b>.</p>
