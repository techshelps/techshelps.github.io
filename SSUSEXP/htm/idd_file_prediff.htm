<h1><a name="idd_file_prediff"></a>File Difference Dialog Box (Visual SourceSafe)</h1>
<p>
By default, VSS uses the Visual display option, with line width calculated to fit on your screen, and no context lines.  If you specify a UNIX display, VSS uses the Ignore Case and Ignore White Space options.  The Visual display shows all lines (infinite context).</p>
<h4>Visual</h4>
<p>
Shows the entire file, with annotations of the changes. </p>
<h4>SourceSafe</h4>
<p>
Shows a list of lines that were added, deleted, and changed, optimized for readability. </p>
<h4>Unix</h4>
<p>
Shows differences information in the format used by the UNIX Diff utility.</p>
<h4>Ignore Case</h4>
<p>
Shows differences without regard for upper- and lowercase differences.</p>
<h4>Ignore White Space</h4>
<p>
Shows differences without regard for spacing characters, such as tabs.</p>
<h4>Report</h4>
<p>
Sends a report to the clipboard, a text file, or a printer.</p>
<h4>Project</h4>
<p>
Displays the Project Difference dialog box.</p>
<h3>Advanced Options</h3>
<h4>Ignore OS Differences</h4>
<p>
Tells VSS to ignore operating system line-break character differences.  This is useful if you are comparing files across a network where one computer is a Macintosh, for example, and the other is operating with Microsoft Windows NT.</p>
<h4>Show Context Lines</h4>
<p>
Includes the specified number of context lines in the differences display.  Context lines are the lines in your file surrounding the line identified as different by VSS.  For example, setting Show Context Lines to three means you'll see three context lines above and three context lines below the difference line.</p>
<h4>Save Settings</h4>
<p>
Saves your selected settings for future use.</p>
