<h1><a name="ers_str_lbx_msmode"></a>This command operates on only one item</h1>
<p>
For many VSS dialog box lists, you can choose more than one item at once, and then act on all the items together.&nbsp; Some actions, however, cannot operate on more than one item at a time.</p>
<p>
This warning has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
You selected more than one item and then applied a command that operates on only one item at a time.&nbsp; For example, you may have tried to use the <b>View</b> command, which works with one file at a time.<p class=tl>
Press the space bar on an item to make it the only item selected in the list.</P></li>
</ul>
