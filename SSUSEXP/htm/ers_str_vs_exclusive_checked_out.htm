<h1><a name="ers_str_vs_exclusive_checked_out"></a>File &lt;File&gt; is exclusively checked out</h1>
<p>
This warning has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
If <b>Multiple Checkouts</b> is enabled, users in VSS can check out files in two ways.&nbsp; First they can allow other users to check out the file or they can check it out so no one else can check out that file, namely exclusively.&nbsp; This message appears when a user attempts to checkout a file that is already exclusively checked out by someone else.&nbsp; It frequently appears with the "&lt;File&gt; is already checked out, continue?" message.<p class=tl>
You will not be able to check out this file until the user who has the file checks it in or performs an <b>undo check out</b>.&nbsp; To find out who has the file checked out, you can use the <b>ss status</b> command or look at the <b>Check Out Status</b> tab on the file <b>Properties</b> dialog. The VSS Administrator can also undo checked out files that another user has checked out.</P></li>
