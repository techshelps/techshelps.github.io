<h1><a name="ers_str_lock_timeout"></a>Timeout locking file: &lt;File name&gt;</h1>
<p>
This warning has the following causes and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
VSS can be set up to use its own form of file locking.&nbsp; This has to be set by the VSS Administrator in the SRCSAFE.INI file.&nbsp; This error indicates a lock file (.LCK extension) exists in the \DATA\LOCKS folder. This situation occurs under either of the following circumstances:<ul type=disc>
<li>
A user has a file locked. For example, a file is locked while it is updated.<br><br></li>
<li>
A VSS lock file has not been deleted from the \DATA\LOCKS folder.<br><br></li>
<li>
A \DATA\LOCKS folder doesn’t exist.</li>
</ul>
<p class=tl>
If a user has a lock on a file then, just retry the command in a few minutes.&nbsp; </P><p class=tl>
If the lock hasn’t been deleted from the \DATA\LOCKS folder, go there and delete the .LCK file, however, please make sure everyone is out of VSS before deleting .LCK files or you may affect another users process. </P><p class=tl>
If this warning appears when you log in to VSS, check to see if a \DATA\LOCKS folder exists.&nbsp; If it doesn’t, create one and attempt to log in again. </P></li>
