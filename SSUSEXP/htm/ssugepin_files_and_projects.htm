Pinning is most useful when applied to shared files, although it is not limited to shared files: You can pin any file. When you pin a shared file, however, you cannot thereafter make changes to it. Pinning is not the same as branching; for one thing, you are not making a copy of the file. For another, you are not planning to change the file. You are sticking a pin into the file so that a particular version of the file becomes the version that is part of your project.</p>
<p>
If a file already pinned is then shared, and the pinned version is the version that is shared, the projects sharing the file cannot change it. If a file is shared first, and then pinned in one project, other projects can still change and update the file. </p>
