<p>
VSS tried to open a project that could not be found in your VSS database.&nbsp; This error has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
You moved or renamed the VSS project in VSS Explorer, then opened your Visual Basic or Visual C++ project that refers to the old VSS project name.<p class=tl>
Click <b>Yes</b> to browse for the project if you know the name of the new project.</P><p class=tl>
Click <b>No</b> if you don't want the project to be under source code control.&nbsp; If you click <b>No</b>, you must manually re-add the project to VSS in order to use source code control features in the future.</P></li>
