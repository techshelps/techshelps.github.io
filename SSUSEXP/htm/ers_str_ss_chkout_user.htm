This warning has the following cause and solutions:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
When someone other than you has a file checked out, there are some things you cannot do to the file. For instance, you cannot delete or rename a file that is checked out.<p class=tl>
Click <b>Yes</b> to check out the file anyway. (<b>Yes All</b> checks out all selected files even if they are already checked out by another user.) If you click <b>Yes</b>, there may be conflicts between your changes and those of another user, which will have to be resolved and merged later.</P><p class=tl>
Click <b>No</b> to cancel the <b>Check Out</b> command. (<b>No All</b> cancels the command for all selected files.)</P></li>
</ul>
<p>
If you want to work on a checked-out file, it's best to check the <b>User</b> column of <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_vssexplorer">VSS Explorer</a> for the name of the user who has it checked out and ask that user to check it in as soon as possible. If the user is unavailable, the <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_vssadministrator">VSS Administrator</a> can undo the check out for you.</p>
