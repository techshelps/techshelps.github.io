<p>
This error has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
You have attempted to view a file for which no file association exists. Without this association, VSS doesn't know which editor to use to display the file.<p class=tl>
Use File Manager to add an association from this file to the appropriate editor, then try your command again.</P><p class=tl>
If you want to override the File Manager association for a specific file type, you can enter specific associations in your SS.INI file, for example:</P><pre><code>.C = C:\VC\VC.EXE
.FRM = C:\WINDOWS\NOTEPAD.EXE
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
