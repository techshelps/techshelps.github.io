Another user has this database under source control and you opened it.  You will overwrite all of the other user's changes unless you exit immediately.  If the other user had anything checked out, his or her changes will be lost the next time they use the Get Command.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Exit immediately, or sacrifice the other user's changes.</p>
