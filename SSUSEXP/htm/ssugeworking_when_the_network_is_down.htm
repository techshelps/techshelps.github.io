<p>
If you can’t get to the net, and discover you need to check out a file, all is not lost, but you will have some additional work.&nbsp; Here are the steps to follow:
<ol>
<li>
Change the read-only attribute on the file to writeable using attrib, or Windows Explorer.<br><br></li>
<li>
Make your changes to the file.<br><br></li>
<li>
When you get back onto the network, use the <b>History</b> dialog box (via <b>Tools</b>, <b>Show History</b>) and the <b>diff</b> button to determine what numbered version of the file you took home.&nbsp; You can do this by doing a diff against successively older versions until you find a diff that only contains the changes that you made.<br><br></li>
<li>
Check out that numbered version of the file from the <b>History</b> dialog box, using the <b>Don’t get local copy</b> option.&nbsp; (You may need to hold down the shift key to see this option.) This option is also available from the command line.&nbsp; <p class=tl>
Now, the file is in the exact state it was before network disconnection and you can proceed safely.&nbsp; </P></li>
</ol>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B>  The VSS Administrator must enable multiple checkouts before you are allowed to check out old versions of files.&nbsp; If multiple checkouts is not enabled, you can check out the latest version of the file by selecting the <b>Don’t get local copy</b> box, but you must manually merge in any changes that happened since you left.
<ol start=5>
<li>
You may need to do a merge before you check in.&nbsp; Make sure your merge does not destroy the work of anyone who checked in since the network went down (or you left the office).<br><br></li>
</ol>
