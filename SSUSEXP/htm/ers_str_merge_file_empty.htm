<p>
This error has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
A zero length file indicates a possible internal VSS error resulting in loss of data during the merge operation. <p class=tl>
Recommended:&nbsp; undo the merge by clicking <b>Yes</b>.&nbsp; If you are certain, however, that you've performed an action that resulted in a valid zero length file, you can click <b>No</b> to save the zero length merge file.</P></li>
