<h1><a name="ssugeset_working_folders"></a>Set Working Folders</h1>
<p>
VSS is a tool for storing and managing files, but editing or compiling files is done in a folder that you specify for VSS to use. This folder is called a working folder<i>.</i> A working folder can be an existing folder or a new folder that VSS creates for you. VSS Explorer displays your working folder path above the list view.</p>
<p>
A working folder is set per user, per project, per machine. If Joe works on projects $/SpreadSheet and $/WordProcessor, he has two different working folders, one for each project. If Hanna works on the same projects, she has her own working folders for each project.</p>
<p>
When you set a working folder for a project, you can set it for the entire project, including all subprojects under that project. You can, however, explicitly set a working folder for any subproject.</p>
<p>
You must specify a working folder to perform any action that copies a file out of VSS, including the <b>Check Out</b> and <b>Get Latest Version</b> commands. When you attempt to use any of these commands without a working folder, VSS displays a message asking if you would like to set a working folder. If you choose not to set a working folder, VSS stops the command.</p>
<p>
The only operation you can perform without a working folder is viewing a file. See <a href="ssugeget_and_view_files_and_projects.htm">Get and View Files and Projects</a> for additional information.</p>
<p>
