<h1><a name="ers_str_adm_nopassword2"></a>You are about to remove the Admin user's VSS password, which will allow any user to run the Administrator's program</h1>
<p>
This warning has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
You are deleting the Admin user's password.<p class=tl>
Leaving the Admin user with no password is a security risk, because any user can then log into the Administrator program and make changes to your VSS database. Click <b>Yes</b> to continue, or <b>No</b> to cancel the operation.</P></li>
