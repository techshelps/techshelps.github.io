In VSS, one file can be <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_sharedfile">shared</a> among multiple projects. Changes to the file from one project are automatically seen by other projects sharing the file. This encourages code reuse. Use the <b>Links</b> tab in the <b>Properties</b> command on the <b>File</b> menu to see a list of projects sharing a file.</p>
<p>
Branching is the process of taking a file in two directions (that is, branches or paths) at once. VSS keeps track of these branches by tracking the different paths as a project.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></B>In other (non-project-oriented) version control systems, branches are tracked through extended version numbers: for example, version "2.3.9.2" is the second revision of the ninth branch of version 2.3. In VSS, however, branches are tracked with different and distinct project names.</p>
<p>
Branching a file breaks the <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_sharelink">shared link</a>, making the file in that project independent of all other projects. The changes you make in the file are not reflected elsewhere, and vice versa. A branch has been created: two files (the file in the project, and its counterpart in other projects) have a shared <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_filehistory">history</a> up to a certain point, and divergent histories after that time.</p>
<p>
After you branch a file, the <b>Links</b> tab does not show the link that has been broken. Instead, you use the <b>Paths</b> tab (also available from the <b>Properties</b> command on the <b>File</b> menu) to view the branch history of the file.</p>
