<p>
This warning has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
VSS only allows one user to check out a file that is set to store only latest version.&nbsp; This is because VSS can't merge the changes of a second user as the ancestor file has been replaced by the first users check in.<p class=tl>
Identify who has the file checked out and have them perform the <b>Check In</b> or <b>Undo Check Out </b>command.&nbsp; If you can't find the individual, the Admin user can check in files another user has checked out.</P><p class=tl>
To identify who has a file checked out, view the <b>Check Out Status</b> tab on the file <b>properties</b> dialog or use the <b>ss status</b> command.</P></li>
