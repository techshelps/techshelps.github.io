<p>
This error has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
VSS will not allow more than one file or subproject with the same name to exist in a single project. At the command line, you are attempting to share a file or subproject to a project that contains the same named file/subproject.<p class=tl>
Use the <b>ss cp</b> command to change your current project to a project that doesn’t contain a file/project with the same name. You can also select a different project or file to share.</P></li>
