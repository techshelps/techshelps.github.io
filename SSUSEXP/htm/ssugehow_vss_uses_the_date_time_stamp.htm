<p>
When you get or check out a file from VSS into your <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_workingfolder">working folder</a>, VSS sets a modification date that your operating system then tracks for each file. </p>
<p>
VSS uses the following rules to determine the date/time it gives your file:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
If you already have a <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_localcopy">local copy</a> of the file and it's identical to the file you are retrieving, VSS does nothing <img src="emdash.gif" border=0> the file's time stamp remains unchanged.<br><br></li>
<li>
If VSS does retrieve the file (you don't already have it or your copy is not up-to-date), it gives the file the current date/time, at the time of the retrieval.</li>
</ul>
<p class=label>
<b>Why VSS Works This Way</b></p>
<p>
The modification date/time is used by many compilers and make systems as a signal of whether a file has changed and therefore has to be recompiled. VSS's treatment of date/time is designed to optimize this process, ensuring that you compile only when you need to.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Changing the Date/Time Stamp</b></p>
<p>
The behavior described above is VSS's default behavior. If your needs are different, you can change the behavior with the options on the <b>Local Files</b> tab of the <b>Options</b> dialog box on the <b>Tools</b> menu or by using the Advanced options on certain dialog boxes like the <b>Get</b> dialog box.</p>
<p>
If your computer is out of sync with another computer, unpredictable results may occur.&nbsp; For instance, you may check in a file after someone else, but VSS may think your checkin happened first, because your system clock was off.&nbsp; The best solution for this problem is to synchronize your local date/time with the network on a regular basis.&nbsp; This will ensure that all users are in sync.&nbsp; With NT this can be done with a Domain Time Source Server.&nbsp; Please check the <u>http://www.novell.com</u> site for information on time synching with Novell NetWare servers.</p>
