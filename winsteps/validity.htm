<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Question: </span>I really want to you to help me in a simple explanation understand how in practice can I go about collecting validity evidences via Rasch Analysis with Winsteps to support use and inference of my test? </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Answer: </span>There are many types of validity described in the literature, Nz, but they summarize to two main topics:</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;">1. Construct validity: does the test measure what it is intended to measure?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;">2. Predictive validity: does the test produce measures which correspond to what we know about the persons?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;">Investigation of these validities is performed directly by inspection of the results of the analysis (Rasch or Classical or ...), or indirectly through correlations of the Rasch measures (or raw scores, etc.) with other numbers which are thought to be good indicators of what we want. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Question: </span>That is what exactly type of validity questions should I ask and how can I answer them using Rasch analysis? </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Answer: </span>1. Construct validity: we need a &quot;construct theory&quot; (i.e., some idea about our latent variable) - we need to state explicitly, before we do our analysis, what will be a more-difficult item, and what will be a less-difficult item.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;">Certainly we can all do that with arithmetic items: 2+2=? is easy. 567856+97765=? is hard. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;">If the Table 1 item map agrees with your statement. Then the test has &quot;construct validity&quot;. It is measuring what you intended to measure.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;">2. Predictive validity: we need to we need to state explicitly, before we do our analysis, what will be a the characteristics of a person with a higher measure, and what will be the characteristics of a person with a lower measure. And preferably code these into the person labels in our Winsteps control file.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;">For arithmetic, we expect older children, children in higher grades, children with better nutrition, children with fewer developmental or discipline problems, etc. to have higher measures. And the reverse for lower measures.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;">If the Table 1 person map agrees with your statement. Then the test has &quot;predictive validity&quot;. It is &quot;predicting&quot; what we expected it to predict. (In statistics, &quot;predict&quot; doesn't mean &quot;predict the future&quot;, &quot;predict&quot; means predict some numbers obtained by other means. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Question: </span>More specifically, in using, for example, DIF analysis via Winsteps what type of validity question I am trying to answer? </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Answer: </span>1. Construct validity: DIF implies that the item difficulty is different for different groups. The meaning of the construct has changed! Perhaps the differences are too small to matter. Perhaps omitting the DIF item will solve the problem. Perhaps making the DIF item into two items will solve the problem.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;">For instance, questions about &quot;snow&quot; change their difficulty. In polar countries they are easy. In tropical countries they are difficult. When we discover this DIF, we would define this as two different items, and so maintain the integrity of the &quot;weather-knowledge&quot; construct.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;">2. Predictive validity: DIF implies that the predictions made for one group of persons, based on their measures, differs from the predictions made for another group. Do the differences matter? Do we need separate measurement systems? ... </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Question: </span>Similarly, in using Fit statistics, dimensionality, and order of item difficulty what type of validity questions I am attempting to answer via Winsteps? </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Answer: </span>They are the same questions every time, Nz. Construct Validity and Predictive Validity. Is there a threat to validity? Is it big enough to matter in a practical way? What is the most effective way of lessening or eliminating the threat? </p>
