There are some links on different sites that are formed by running a Java 
script on different events like page loading or pressing a button. IDM 
Grabber can run all such Java script to retrieve such links. But in some 
cases when running a script, the Grabber may run unwanted commands like 
starting an installation of a component. Use "Process Javascript" option 
with caution and only if you know that the site has no malicious Java 
script, or if you trust the site you are downloading from.

<div>
Even with this option turned off, the Grabber will screen the text of Java 
script and retrieve most of the links except those which are derived from 
complex Java script expressions.
