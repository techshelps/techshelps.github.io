By default <strong>"Look up files in IE cache before downloading"</strong> box is checked. If the grabber finds a file in IE cache, it checks if the file was changed. If the file was changed, the grabber downloads it from the site. If not, the grabber takes it from the cache of IE. If you don't use Internet Explorer, you may turn this option off.
