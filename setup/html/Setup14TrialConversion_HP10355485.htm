For example, if your Trial version is a trial of Microsoft Office Professional 2010, when you convert to the Full version you must enter a Product Key for Microsoft Office Professional 2010, not for, say, Microsoft Office Standard 2010. Converting from a Trial or Subscription version to the Full product removes the usage limits on the software. None of your program settings or data is affected by the conversion.</p><p><b class="runinhead">Enter Product Key</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Click this option if you have already purchased your Full product either online or from a retail store. You can usually find the Product Key either on your CD case or other packaging, or in the confirmation e-mail message from your online purchase.</p><p><b class="runinhead">Buy Product Key Online</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Click this option if you have not yet purchased a Full product and want to buy the product now on the Internet. Your Web browser opens at a site where you can make your purchase and obtain the Product Key for your copy of the Full product. (Online purchase of a Product Key may not be available in some countries/regions.)</p>If you receive an error message or encounter a problem, visit <a href="http://r.office.microsoft.com/r/rlidAWSContentRedir?AssetID=XT103697251033&amp;CTT=11&amp;Origin=1033" target="_new">The Microsoft Office 2010 Setup Resource Center</a> for troubleshooting information and how to contact Microsoft Product Support.<META NAME="CreationDate" CONTENT="2009-01-01"></body></html>
