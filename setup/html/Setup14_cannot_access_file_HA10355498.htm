			The disc might have dust, smudges, or fingerprints on it.  Cleaning the disc usually resolves this. You can clean the disc with any commercially available cleaning kit. Follow the disc manufacturer's recommendations. Use a soft, lint-free cloth, and wipe gently in a straight line from the center of the disc to the outside edge. Always handle the disc by its edges, and always avoid touching the shiny surface of the disc.</li><li><b class="runinhead">The CD or DVD is damaged</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
			The disc might be physically scratched or in some other way damaged.  If so, you must either repair the disc or order a replacement disc from Microsoft Product Support.<p>When a disc is scratched, a scratch in the clear coating of the disc interferes with the laser that reads the data&nbsp;— the disc's data section itself is not damaged. You can repair the disc
			either by filling in the scratch with an optical material or by polishing down the scratch to remove it. In either case, follow the disc manufacturer's recommendations. There are many commercial products that are designed to help you remove scratches and dirt from a disc.</p></li><li><b class="runinhead">The CD or DVD drive does not work</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Your hardware might be damaged, or it might need an updated driver. It is
