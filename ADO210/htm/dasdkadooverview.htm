				Version 2.5</H1>
			<H2 class="dtH2">Purpose</H2>
			<P>Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) enable your client applications to access 
				and manipulate data from a database server through an OLE DB provider. Its 
				primary benefits are ease of use, high speed, low memory overhead, and a small 
				disk footprint. ADO supports key features for building client/server and 
				Web-based applications.</P>
			<H2 class="dtH2">RDS</H2>
			<P>ADO also features Remote Data Service (RDS), by which you can move data from a 
				server to a client application or Web page, manipulate the data on the client, 
				and return updates to the server in a single round trip.
			</P>
			<H2 class="dtH2">ADO MD</H2>
			<P>Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (Multidimensional) (ADO&nbsp;MD) provides easy 
				access to multidimensional data from languages such as Microsoft Visual Basic, 
				Microsoft Visual C++, and Microsoft Visual J++. ADO MD extends Microsoft 
				ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) to include objects specific to multidimensional 
				data, such as the CubeDef and Cellset objects. With ADO MD you can browse 
				multidimensional schema, query a cube, and retrieve the results.</P>
			<P>Like ADO, ADO MD uses an underlying OLE DB provider to gain access to data. To 
				work with ADO MD, the provider must be a multidimensional data provider (MDP) 
				as defined by the OLE DB for OLAP specification. MDPs present data in 
				multidimensional views as opposed to tabular data providers (TDPs) that present 
				data in tabular views. Refer to the documentation for your OLAP OLE DB provider 
				for more detailed information on the specific syntax and behaviors supported by 
				your provider.</P>
			<H2 class="dtH2">ADOX</H2>
			<P>Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects Extensions for Data Definition Language and 
				Security (ADOX) is an extension to the ADO objects and programming model. ADOX 
				includes objects for schema creation and modification, as well as security. 
				Because it is an object-based approach to schema manipulation, you can write 
				code that will work against various data sources regardless of differences in 
				their native syntaxes.</P>
			<P>ADOX is a companion library to the core ADO objects. It exposes additional 
				objects for creating, modifying, and deleting schema objects, such as tables 
				and procedures. It also includes security objects to maintain users and groups 
				and to grant and revoke permissions on objects.</P>
