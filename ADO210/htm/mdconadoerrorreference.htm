<TD width=41%><B>adErrInvalidArgument</B></TD>
<TD width=47%>Arguments are of the wrong type, are out of acceptable range, or are in conflict with one another. This error is often caused by a typographical error in an SQL SELECT statement. For example, a misspelled field name or table name can generate this error. This error can also occur when a field or table named in a SELECT statement does not exist in the data store.</TD>

<TD width=41%><B>adErrOpeningFile</B></TD>
