<P>After connecting to a data source, you need to execute requests against it to obtain result sets. ADO encapsulates this type of command functionality in the <B>Command</B> object.</P>

<P>You can use the <B>Command</B> object to request any type of operation from the provider, assuming that the provider can interpret the command string properly. A common operation for data providers is to query a database and return records in a <B>Recordset</B> object. <B>Recordset</B>s will be discussed later in this and other chapters; for now, think of them as tools to hold and view result sets. As with many ADO objects, depending on the functionality of the provider, some <B>Command</B> object collections, methods, or properties might generate errors when referenced.</P>

<P>It is not always necessary to create a <B>Command</B> object to execute a command against a data source. You can use the <B>Execute</B> method on the <B>Connection</B> object or the <B>Open</B> method on the <B>Recordset</B> object. However, you should use a <B>Command</B> object if you need to reuse a command in your code or if you need to pass detailed parameter information with your command. These scenarios are covered in more detail later in this chapter.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE class="dtBlock">
<b class="le">Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain <B>Command</B>s can return a result set as a binary stream or as a single <B>Record</B> rather than as a <B>Recordset</B>, if this is supported by the provider. Also, some <B>Command</B>s are not intended to return any result set at all (for example, a SQL Update query). This chapter will cover the most typical scenario, however: executing <B>Command</B>s that return results into a <B>Recordset</B> object. For more information about returning results into <B>Record</B>s or <B>Stream</B>s, see <A HREF="mdmscadofordocuments.htm">Chapter 10: Records and Streams</A>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
