<H1 class="dtH1"><A NAME="mdmscrecordsprovidersuppliedextrafields"></A>Records and Provider-Supplied Fields</H1>

<P>When a <A HREF="mdobjrecord.htm">Record</A> object is opened, its source can be the current row of an open <A HREF="mdobjodbrec.htm">Recordset</A>, an absolute URL, or a relative URL in conjunction with an open <A HREF="mdobjconnection.htm">Connection</A> object.</P>

<P>If the <B>Record</B> is opened from a <B>Recordset</B>, the <B>Record</B> object <A HREF="mdcolfields.htm">Fields</A> collection will contain all the fields from the <B>Recordset</B>, plus any fields added by the underlying provider.</P>

<P>The provider may insert additional fields that serve as supplementary characteristics of the <B>Record</B>. As a result, a <B>Record</B> may have unique fields not in the <B>Recordset</B> as a whole or any <B>Record</B> derived from another row of the <B>Recordset</B>.</P>

<P>For example, all rows of a <B>Recordset</B> derived from an e-mail data source might have columns such as From, To, and Subject. A <B>Record</B> derived from that <B>Recordset</B> will have the same fields. However, the <B>Record</B> may also have other fields unique to the particular message represented by that <B>Record</B>, such as Attachment and Cc (carbon copy).</P>

<P>Although the <B>Record</B> object and current row of the <B>Recordset</B> have the same fields, they are different because <B>Record</B> and <B>Recordset</B> objects have different methods and properties.</P>

<P>A field held in common by the <B>Record</B> and <B>Recordset</B> can be modified on either object. However, the field cannot be deleted on the <B>Record</B> object, although the underlying provider may support setting the field to null.</P>

<P>After the <B>Record</B> is opened, you can programmatically add fields. You can also delete fields you have added, but you cannot delete fields from the original <B>Recordset</B>.</P>

<P>You may also open the <B>Record</B> object directly from a URL. In this case, the fields added to the <B>Record</B> depend on the underlying provider. Currently, most providers add a set of fields that describe the entity represented by the <B>Record</B>. If the entity consists of a stream of bytes, such as a simple file, then a <A HREF="mdobjstream.htm">Stream</A> object can usually be opened from the <B>Record</B>.</P>

<H2 class="dtH2">Special Fields for Document Source Providers</H2>

<P>A special class of providers, called <I>document source providers</I>, manages folders and documents. When a <B>Record</B> object represents a document or a <B>Recordset</B> object represents a folder of documents, the document source provider populates those objects with a unique set of fields that describe characteristics of the document instead of the actual document itself. Typically, one field contains a reference to the <B>Stream</B> that represents the document.</P>

<P>These fields constitute a resource <B>record</B> or <B>recordset</B> and are listed for the specific providers that support them in <A HREF="mdrefadoprovinfo.htm">Appendix A: Providers</A>.</P>

<P>Two constants index the <B>Fields</B> collection of a resource <B>Record</B> or <B>Recordset</B> to retrieve a pair of commonly used fields. The <B>Field</B> object <A HREF="mdprovalue.htm">Value</A> property returns the desired content.

<UL type="disc">
	<LI>The field accessed with the <B>adDefaultStream</B> constant contains a default stream associated with the <B>Record</B> or <B>Recordset</B> object. The provider assigns a default stream to an object.</li>

	<LI>The field accessed with the <B>adRecordURL</B> constant contains the absolute URL that identifies the document.</li>
</UL>

<P>A document source provider does not support the <A HREF="mdcolproperties.htm">Properties</A> collection of <B>Record</B> and <B>Field</B> objects. The content of the <B>Properties</B> collection is null for such objects.</P>

<P>A document source provider may add a provider-specific property such as <B>Datasource Type</B> to identify whether it is a document source provider. For more information about how to determine your type of provider, see your provider documentation.</P>

<H2 class="dtH2">Resource Recordset Columns</H2>

<P>A <I>resource recordset </I>consists of the following columns.</P>
