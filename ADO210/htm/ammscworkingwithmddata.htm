<P>A <I>cellset</I> is the result of a query on multidimensional data. It consists of a collection of axes, usually no more than four axes and typically only two or three. An <I>axis</I> is a collection of members from one or more dimensions, which is used to locate or filter specific values in a cube.</P>

<P>A <I>position</I> is a point along an axis. For an axis consisting of a single dimension, these positions are a subset of the dimension members. If an axis consists of more than one dimension, then each position is a compound entity, which has <I>n</I> parts where <I>n</I> is the number of dimensions oriented along that axis. Each part of the position is a member from one constituent dimension.</P>

<P>For example, if the Geography and Product dimensions from a cube containing sales data are oriented along the x-axis of a cellset, a position along this axis may contain the members "USA" and "Computers." In this example, determining a position along the x-axis requires that members from each dimension are oriented along the axis.</P>

<P>A <I>cell</I> is an object positioned at the intersection of axis coordinates. Each cell has multiple pieces of information associated with it, including the data itself, a formatted string (the displayable form of cell data), and the cell ordinal value. (Each cell is a unique ordinal value in the cellset. The ordinal value of the first cell in the cellset is zero, while the leftmost cell in the second row of a cellset with eight columns would have an ordinal value of eight.)</P>

<P>For example, a cube has the following six dimensions (note that this cube schema differs slightly from the example given in <A HREF="ammscoverviewmdschemasanddata.htm">Overview of Multidimensional Schemas and Data</A>):

<UL type="disc">
	<LI>Salesperson</li>

	<LI>Geography (natural hierarchy)&#0151;Continents, Countries, States, and so on</li>

	<LI>Quarters&#0151;Quarters, Months, Days</li>

	<LI>Years</li>

	<LI>Measures&#0151;Sales, PercentChange, BudgetedSales</li>

	<LI>Products</li>
</UL>

<P>The following cellset represents sales for 1991 for all products:</P>

<P class="fig"><IMG SRC="mdsales.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE class="dtBlock">
<b class="le">Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cell values in the example can be viewed as ordered pairs of axis position ordinals where the first digit represents the x-axis position and the second digit the y-axis position.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The characteristics of this cellset are as follows:

<UL type="disc">
	<LI>Axis dimensions: Quarters, Salesperson, Geography</li>

	<LI>Filter dimensions: Measures, Years, Products</li>

	<LI>Two axes: COLUMN (x, or Axis 0) and ROW (y, or Axis 1)</li>

	<LI>x-axis: two nested dimensions, Salesperson and Geography</li>

	<LI>y-axis: Quarters dimension</li>
</UL>

<P>The x-axis has two nested dimensions: Salesperson and Geography. From Geography, four members are selected: Seattle, Boston, USA-South, and Japan. Two members are selected from Salesperson: Valentine and Nash. This yields a total of eight positions on this axis (8 = 4*2).</P>

<P>Each coordinate is represented as a position with two members&#0151;one from the Salesperson dimension and another from the Geography dimension:</P>

<PRE class="code">(Valentine, Seattle), (Valentine, Boston), (Valentine, USA_North),
(Valentine, Japan), (Nash, Seattle), (Nash, Boston), (Nash, USA_North),
(Nash, Japan)</PRE>

<P>The y-axis has only one dimension, containing the following eight positions:</P>

<PRE class="code">Jan, Feb, Mar, Qtr2, Qtr3, Oct, Nov, Dec</PRE>

<P>Cellsets, cells, axes, and positions are all represented in ADO MD by corresponding objects: <A HREF="amobjcellset.htm">Cellset</A>, <A HREF="amobjcell.htm">Cell</A>, <A HREF="amobjaxis.htm">Axis</A>, and <A HREF="amobjposition.htm">Position</A>.</P>
