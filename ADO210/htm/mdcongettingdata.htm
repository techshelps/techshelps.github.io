<P>The preceding chapter introduced four primary operations involved in creating an ADO application: getting data, examining data, editing data, and updating data. This chapter will focus on the details of the concepts relevant to the first operation: getting data. </P>

<P>Several ADO objects can play a role in this operation. First you connect to the data source using an ADO <B>Connection</B> object (which at times will be created implicitly). Then you pass instructions to the data source about what you want to do using an ADO <B>Command</B> object (which also can be created implicitly). The result of passing a command to a data source and receiving its response usually will be represented in an ADO <B>Recordset</B> object.</P>

<P>To get data, your application must be in communication with a data source, such as a DBMS, a file store, or a comma-delimited text file. This communication represents a <I>connection</I>&#0151;the environment necessary for exchanging data.</P>

<P>The ADO object model represents the concept of a connection with the <B>Connection</B> object&#0151;the foundation upon which much ADO functionality is built. The purpose of a <B>Connection</B> object is to:

<UL type="disc">
	<LI>Define the information ADO needs to communicate with data sources and create sessions.</li>

	<LI>Define the transactional capabilities of the session.</li>

	<LI>Allow you to create and execute commands against the data source.</li>

	<LI>Provide information about the design of the underlying data source in the form of schema rowsets. For more information about schema rowsets, see <A HREF="mdmthopenschema.htm">OpenSchema Method</A>.</li>
