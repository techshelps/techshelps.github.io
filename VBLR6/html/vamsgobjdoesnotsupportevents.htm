<P class=T>Not every component supports client sinking of events. This error has the following cause and solution:

<UL>
	<LI class=LB1>You tried to use a <B>WithEvents</B> variable with a component that can't work as an event source for the specified set of events. For example, you may be sinking events of an object, then create another object that <B>Implements</B> the first object. Although you might think you could sink the events from the implemented object, that isn't automatically the case. <B>Implements</B> only implements an interface for methods and properties.
<P class=LT1>You can't sink events for a component that doesn't source events.
</LI>

	<LI class=LB1><B>WithEvents</B> isn't supported for Private UserControls, because the type-info needed to raise the ObjectEvent isn't available at runtime.</LI>
</UL>

<P class=T>For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).</P>
