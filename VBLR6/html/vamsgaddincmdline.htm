<P class=T>This error has the following causes and solutions:

<UL>
	<LI class=LB1>"Command-line safe" means that the add-in is registered in a way to indicate that it contains no user interfaces that require user input when Visual Basic is invoked through a command-line. A user interface can interfere with the operation of unattended processes (such as build scripts).
<P class=LT1>If you don't indicate that an add-in is command-line safe (even if it <I>is</I> command-line safe), when a user selects your add-in and then Command Line in the Load Behavior box, they'll receive the warning message. This isn't a serious problem, but merely a warning to the user that the selected add-in might possibly contain UI elements that can pop up unexpectedly and halt their automated scripts by pausing for user input.

<P class=LT1>To specify that an add-in is command-line safe, author it that way (you can use the Add-In designer for this), or manually change the value in the registry key.
</LI>
</UL>

<P class=T>For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).</P>
