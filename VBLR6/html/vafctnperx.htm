<H2><A NAME="vafctnperx"></A>NPer Function Example</H2>

<P class=T>This example uses the <B>NPer</B> function to return the number of periods during which payments must be made to pay off a loan whose value is contained in <CODE>PVal</CODE>. Also provided are the interest percentage rate per period (<CODE>APR / 12</CODE>), the payment (<CODE>Payment</CODE>), the future value of the loan (<CODE>FVal</CODE>), and a number that indicates whether the payment is due at the beginning or end of the payment period (<CODE>PayType</CODE>).</P>

<PRE class=CT><CODE>Dim FVal, PVal, APR, Payment, PayType, TotPmts
Const ENDPERIOD = 0, BEGINPERIOD = 1    ' When payments are made.
FVal = 0    ' Usually 0 for a loan.
PVal = InputBox("How much do you want to borrow?")
APR = InputBox("What is the annual percentage rate of your loan?")
If APR &gt; 1 Then APR = APR / 100    ' Ensure proper form.
Payment = InputBox("How much do you want to pay each month?")
PayType = MsgBox("Do you make payments at the end of month?", vbYesNo)
If PayType = vbNo Then PayType = BEGINPERIOD Else PayType = ENDPERIOD
TotPmts = <B>NPer(</B>APR / 12<B>,</B> -Payment<B>,</B> PVal<B>,</B> FVal<B>,</B> PayType<B>)</B>
If Int(TotPmts) &lt;&gt; TotPmts Then TotPmts = Int(TotPmts) + 1
MsgBox "It will take you " &amp; TotPmts &amp; " months to pay off your loan."
