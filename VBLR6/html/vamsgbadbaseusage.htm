<P class=T>You cannot use the name of a base class by itself. This error has the following causes and solutions:

<UL>
	<LI class=LB1>You tried to use the name of a base class by itself without making clear that you were trying to access the base class' default member.
<P class=LT1>Place the base-class name within parentheses to indicate you want to access the default member.
</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>You used the base-class name in an expression but the member you were trying to access was ambiguously specified.
<P class=LT1>Use a disambiguator ( for example, an exclamation point) between the base-class name and the member you are interested in.
</LI>

	<LI class=LB1>You used the base-class name in a <B>Set</B> statement as though it contained a reference to the class.
<P class=LT1>Use the base-class name to retrieve a reference for example, using GetObject.
</LI>
</UL>

<P class=T>For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).</P>
