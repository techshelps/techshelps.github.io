<h2><a name="_win32_cosmetic_pens"></a>Cosmetic Pens</h2>
<p>
The dimensions of a cosmetic pen are specified in device units. Therefore, lines drawn with a cosmetic pen always have a fixed width. Lines drawn with a cosmetic pen are generally drawn three to ten times faster than lines drawn with a geometric pen. Cosmetic pens have three attributes: width, style, and color. For more information about these attributes, see <a href="pens_0trn.htm">Pen Attributes</a>. </p>
<p>
To create a cosmetic pen, an application uses the <a href="pens_9wha.htm"><b>CreatePen</b></a>, <a href="pens_5rxw.htm"><b>CreatePenIndirect</b></a>, or <a href="pens_6rse.htm"><b>ExtCreatePen</b></a> function. To retrieve one of the three <i>stock</i> cosmetic pens managed by window manager, the application uses the <a href="devcons_1t10.htm"><b>GetStockObject</b></a> function. </p>
<p>
After a pen is created (or a handle identifying one of the stock pens is obtained), the pen is selected into the application's device context (DC) by calling the <a href="devcons_9v3o.htm"><b>SelectObject</b></a> function. From this point on, the application uses this pen for any line-drawing operations in its client area. </p>
