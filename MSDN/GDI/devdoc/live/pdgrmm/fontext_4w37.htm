<p>
Although most font selection operations involve the user, there are some instances where this is not true. For example, a developer may want to use a unique font in an application to draw text in a control window. To select an appropriate font, the application must be able to determine what fonts are available, create a logical font that describes one of these available fonts, and then select that font into the appropriate device context. </p>
<p>
An application can enumerate the available fonts by using the <a href="fontext_2z03.htm"><b>EnumFontFamilies</b></a> function. This can be useful when an application must determine which fonts are available from a given family.</p>
<p>
Once an application has enumerated the available fonts and located an appropriate match, it should use the values returned by the font enumeration function to initialize the members of a <a href="fontext_1wmq.htm"><b>LOGFONT</b></a> structure. Then it can call the <a href="fontext_4rw4.htm"><b>CreateFontIndirect</b></a> function, passing to it a pointer to the initialized <b>LOGFONT</b> structure. If the <b>CreateFontIndirect</b> function is successful, the application can then select the logical font by calling the <a href="devcons_9v3o.htm"><b>SelectObject</b></a> function.</p>
<p>
When initializing the members of the <b>LOGFONT </b>structure, be sure to specify a specific character set in the <b>lfCharSet</b> member. This member is important in the font mapping process and the results will be inconsistent if this member is not initialized correctly. If you specify a typeface name in the <b>lfFaceName</b> member of the <b>LOGFONT </b>structure, make sure that the <b>lfCharSet</b> value matches the character set of the typeface specified in <b>lfFaceName</b>. For example, if you want to select a font such as "MS Mincho", <b>lfCharSet </b>must be set to the predefined value SHIFTJIS_CHARSET.</p>
