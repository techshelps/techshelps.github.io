<h2><a name="_win32_clip_paths"></a>Clip Paths</h2>
<p>
Like a clipping region, a clip path is another graphics object that an application can select into a device context. Unlike a clipping region, a clip path is always created by an application and it is used for clipping to one or more irregular shapes. For example, an application can use the lines and curves that form the outlines of characters in a string of text to define a clip path. </p>
<p>
To create a clip path, it's first necessary to create a path that describes the required irregular shape. Paths are created by calling the appropriate graphics device interface (GDI) drawing functions after calling the <a href="paths_4ciw.htm"><b>BeginPath</b></a> function and before calling the <a href="paths_3boo.htm"><b>EndPath</b></a> function. This collection of functions is called a path bracket. For more information about paths and path brackets, see <a href="paths_8acz.htm"><b>Paths</b></a>. </p>
<p>
After the path is created, it can be converted to a clip path by calling the <a href="clipping_2anc.htm"><b>SelectClipPath</b></a> function, identifying a device context, and specifying a usage mode. The usage mode determines how the system combines the new clip path with the device context's original clipping region. The following table describes the usage modes. </p>
