<h2><a name="_win32_using_regions_to_clip_output"></a>Using Regions to Clip Output</h2>
<p>
This section contains a single example that demonstrates how you can use regions to enable the user to define how a part of client area output can appear. Regions used for this purpose are called clipping regions. </p>
<p>
The example for this section is taken from a Win32-based application that enables a user to capture the entire desktop as a bitmap and then isolate and save a part of this image as a .BMP file. </p>
<p>
By clicking <b>Define Clip Region</b> from the application's menu, the user is able to select a clipping region by clicking the left mouse button and dragging the mouse. As the user drags the mouse, the application draws a rectangle that corresponds to the new clipping region.</p>
<p>
By clicking <b>Clip</b> from the application's menu, the user is able to redraw the isolated part of the image within the boundaries of the specified rectangle. </p>
