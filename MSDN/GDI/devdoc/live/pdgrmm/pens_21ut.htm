<h3><a name="_win32_pen_style"></a>Pen Style</h3>
<p>
The style attribute specifies the line pattern that appears when a particular cosmetic or geometric pen is used. There are eight predefined pen styles. The following illustration shows the seven of these styles that are defined by the system. </p>
<p>

<p>
The inside-frame style is identical to the solid style for cosmetic pens. However, it operates differently when used with a geometric pen. If the geometric pen is wider than a single pixel and a drawing function uses the pen to draw a border around a filled object, the system draws the border <i>inside</i> the object's frame. By using the inside-frame style, an application can ensure that an object appears entirely within the specified dimensions, regardless of the geometric pen width. </p>
<p>
In addition to the seven styles defined by the system, there is an eighth style that is user (or application) defined. A user-defined style generates lines with a customized series of dashes and dots. </p>
<p>
Use the <a href="pens_9wha.htm"><b>CreatePen</b></a>, <a href="pens_5rxw.htm"><b>CreatePenIndirect</b></a>, or <a href="pens_6rse.htm"><b>ExtCreatePen</b></a> function to create a pen that has the system-defined styles. Use the <b>ExtCreatePen</b> function to create a pen that has a user-defined style. </p>
