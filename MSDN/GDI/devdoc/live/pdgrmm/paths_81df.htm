<h2><a name="_win32_clip_paths_and_graphic_effects"></a>Clip Paths and Graphic Effects</h2>
<p>
An application can use clipping and paths to create special graphic effects. The following illustration shows a string of text drawn with a large Arial font. </p>
<p>
<img src="images/cspth_02.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
The next illustration shows the result of selecting the text as a clip path and drawing radial lines for a circle whose center is located above and left of the string. </p>
<p>
<img src="images/cspth_03.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before graphics device interface (GDI) adds text created with a bitmapped font to a path, it converts the font to an outline or vector font. </p>
<p>
An application creates a clip path by generating a path bracket and then calling the <a href="clipping_2anc.htm"><b>SelectClipPath</b></a> function. After a clip path is selected into a DC, output only appears within the borders of the path. </p>
<p>
In addition to creating special graphics effects, clip paths are also useful in applications that save images as enhanced metafiles. By using a clip path, an application is able to ensure device independence because the units used to specify a path are logical units (as opposed to device units that are used to specify a region). </p>
