<p>
After checking the Basic code for syntax errors, the Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 5.0 consolidates code and property values for your application into a .PVB file for transport to the emulation environment or Windows CE device. You may encounter the following error messages when creating the PVB file.</p>
<p>
<b>Your project specifies &lt;<i>control name</i>&gt;.&lt;<i>property</i>&gt;</b></p>
<p>
Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic only supports some of the properties allowed for intrinsic controls in Visual Basic. Unsupported properties should retain their default values, which the Toolkit verifies while creating the .PVB file. Each unsupported property found is displayed in a separate dialog box. You can cancel the listing of unsupported properties by pressing the <b>Cancel</b> button.</p>
<p>
<b>Your project specifies a control array &lt;<i>control name</i>&gt;</b></p>
<p>
Control arrays are not currently supported for Windows CE. Each member of the control array has the same name, but a different non-negative <b>Index</b> property value. Controls that are not members of a control array have a unique (to the form) name, and an Index value of -1 (negative one). If you receive this error message, check that the indicated control has an Index value of -1.</p>
<p>
<b>There are too many open files</b></p>
<p>
You should not get this message on a properly configured Windows NT workstation.</p>
<p>
<b>No write permission for file</b></p>
<p>
A previous version of the local PVB file for your project was found, and either has its read-only property set or does not allow you write permissions. Either change the permissions for the file, or change the local path to a different location where a new PVB file can be created.</p>
<p>
<b>File is currently being used</b></p>
<p>
A previous version of the local PVB file for your project was found, and some other program is currently accessing it. Close the file or exit the other program as appropriate.</p>
<p>
<b>PVB file larger than the available space</b></p>
<p>
Your local disk drive is running short on space. Delete unnecessary files on the local disk or select an alternate location to get enough space for the PVB file.</p>
