<h2><a name="_vbce_clipcontrols"></a>ClipControls</h2>
<p>
Returns or sets a value that determines whether graphics methods in <b>Paint</b> events repaint the entire object or only newly exposed areas. Also determines whether the Microsoft Windows CE operating environment creates a clipping region that excludes non-graphical controls contained by the object. Read-only at run time.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
<i>object</i>.<b>ClipControls</b></p>
<p>
The parts of the <b>ClipControls</b> property syntax are described in the following table.</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=50%>Part</th>
<th align=left width=50%>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=50%><i>object</i></td>
<td width=50%>An object expression that evaluates to an object.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=50%><i>boolean</i></td>
<td width=50%>A Boolean expression that specifies how objects are repainted, as described in Settings.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<h4>Settings</h4>
<p>
The settings for <i>boolean</i> are described in the following table. </p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=50%>Setting</th>
<th align=left width=50%>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=50%><b>True </b></td>
<td width=50%>(Default). Graphics methods in <b>Paint</b> events repaint the entire object. A clipping region is created around nongraphical controls on the form before a <b>Paint</b> event.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=50%><b>False </b></td>
<td width=50%>Graphics methods in <b>Paint</b> events repaint only newly exposed areas. A clipping region is not created around nongraphical controls before a <b>Paint</b> event. Complex forms usually load and repaint faster when <b>ClipControls</b> is set to <b>False.</b></td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Clipping is the process of determining which parts of a form or container, such as a <b>Frame</b> control, are painted when the form is displayed. An outline of the form and controls is created in memory. The Windows operating environment uses this outline to paint some parts, such as the background, without affecting other parts, such as the contents of a <b>TextBox</b> control. Because the clipping region is created in memory, setting this property to <b>False</b> can reduce the time needed to paint or repaint a form.</p>
<p>
The clipping region includes most controls, but does not clip around the <b>Label</b>, <b>DrawLine</b>, or <b>Shape</b> controls.</p>
<p>
Avoid nesting intrinsic controls with <b>ClipControls</b> set to <b>True</b> inside a control with <b>ClipControls</b> set to <b>False</b> (for instance, a command button inside a frame). This kind of control nesting causes the controls to repaint incorrectly. To fix this problem, set the <b>ClipControls</b> property for both the container control and the nested controls to <b>True</b>.</p>
