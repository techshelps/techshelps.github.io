<h2><a name="_vbce_vbs_cdate"></a>CDate</h2>
<p>
Returns an expression that has been converted to a Variant of subtype Date.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
CDate(date)</p>
<p>
The date argument is any valid date expression. </p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Use the IsDateto determine if date can be converted to a date or time. CDate recognizes date literals and time literals as well as some numbers that fall within the range of acceptable dates. When converting a number to a date, the whole number portion is converted to a date. Any fractional part of the number is converted to a time of day, starting at midnight.</p>
<p>
<b>CDate</b> recognizes date formats according to the locale setting of your system. The correct order of day, month, and year may not be determined if it is provided in a format other than one of the recognized date settings. In addition, a long date format is not recognized if it also contains the day-of-the-week string.</p>
