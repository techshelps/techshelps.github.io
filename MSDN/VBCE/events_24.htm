<h2><a name="_vbce_lostfocus"></a>LostFocus</h2>
<p>
Occurs when an object loses the focus, either by user action, such as tabbing to or clicking another object, or by changing the focus in code using the <b>SetFocus</b> method.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
<b>Private Sub</b> <i>object</i>_<b>LostFocus( )</b></p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
A <b>LostFocus</b> event procedure is primarily useful for verification and validation updates. Using <b>LostFocus</b> can cause validation to take place as the user moves the focus from the control. Another use for this type of event procedure is enabling, disabling, hiding, and displaying other objects as in a <b>GotFocus</b> event procedure. You can also reverse or change conditions that you set up in the object's <b>GotFocus</b> event procedure.</p>
