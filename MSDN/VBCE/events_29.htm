<h2><a name="_vbce_paint"></a>Paint</h2>
<p>
Occurs when part or all of an object is exposed after being moved or enlarged, or after a window that was covering the object has been moved.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
Private Sub Form_<b>Paint</b>( )</p>
<p>
The <b>Paint</b> event syntax has these parts:</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=48%>Part</th>
<th align=left width=52%>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=48%><i>object</i></td>
<td width=52%>An object expression that evaluates to an object. </td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
A <b>Paint</b> event procedure is useful if you have output from graphics methods in your code. With a <b>Paint</b> procedure, you can ensure that such output is repainted when necessary.</p>
<p>
The <b>Paint</b> event is invoked when the <b>Refresh</b> method is used.</p>
<p>
If the <b>ClipControls</b> property is set to <b>False</b>, graphics methods in the <b>Paint</b> event procedure affect only newly exposed areas of the form; otherwise, the graphics methods repaint all areas of the form not covered by controls (except <b>Label</b>, <b>Line</b>, and <b>Shape</b> controls).</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  Using a <b>Refresh</b> method in a <b>Resize</b> event procedure forces repainting of the entire object every time a user resizes the form.</p>
<p>
Using a <b>Paint</b> event procedure for certain tasks can cause a cascading event. In general, avoid using a <b>Paint</b> event procedure to do the following:
<ul>
<li>
Move or size a form or control.</li>
<li>
Change any variables that affect size or appearance, such as setting an object's <b>BackColor</b> property.</li>
<li>
Invoke a <b>Refresh</b> method.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A <b>Resize</b> event procedure may be more appropriate for some of these tasks.</p>
