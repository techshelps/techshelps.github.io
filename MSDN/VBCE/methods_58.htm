<h2><a name="_vbce_ppmt"></a>PPmt</h2>
<p>
Specifies the principal payment for a given period of an annuity based on periodic fixed payments and a fixed interest rate.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
<b>PPmt</b><i>(variant rate, variant per, variant nper, variant pv, [optional]VARIANT fv, variant* due, [out, retval] variant* value);</i></p>
<p>
<b>PPmt</b><i>(rate, per, nper, pv[, fv[, type]])</i></p>
<p>
The <b>PPmt</b> function has the following named arguments:
<dl>
<dt>
<i>rate</i></dt>
<dd>
Required. Variant specifying interest rate per period. For example, if you obtain a car loan at an annual percentage rate (APR) of 10 percent and make monthly payments, the rate per period is 0.1/12, or 0.0083.</dd>
<dt>
<i>per</i></dt>
<dd>
Required. Variant specifying payment period in the range 1 through <i>nper</i>.</dd>
<dt>
<i>nper</i></dt>
<dd>
Required. Variant specifying total number of payment periods in the annuity. For example, if you make monthly payments on a four-year car loan, your loan has a total of 4 * 12 (or 48) payment periods.</dd>
<dt>
<i>pv</i></dt>
<dd>
Required. Variant specifying present value, or value today, of a series of future payments or receipts. For example, when you borrow money to buy a car, the loan amount is the present value to the lender of the monthly car payments you will make.</dd>
<dt>
<i>fv</i></dt>
<dd>
Optional. Variant specifying future value or cash balance you want after you have made the final payment. For example, the future value of a loan is $0 because that is its value after the final payment. However, if you want to save $50,000 over 18 years for your child's education, then $50,000 is the future value. If omitted, 0 is assumed.</dd>
<dt>
<i>type</i></dt>
<dd>
Required. Variant specifying when payments are due. Use 0 if payments are due at the end of the payment period, or use 1 if payments are due at the beginning of the period. If omitted, 0 is assumed. </dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
An annuity is a series of fixed cash payments made over a period of time. An annuity can be a loan (such as a home mortgage) or an investment (such as a monthly savings plan).</p>
<p>
The <i>rate</i> and <i>nper</i> arguments must be calculated using payment periods expressed in the same units. For example, if <i>rate</i> is calculated using months, <i>nper</i> must also be calculated using months.</p>
<p>
For all arguments, cash paid out (such as deposits to savings) is represented by negative numbers; cash received (such as dividend checks) is represented by positive numbers.</p>
