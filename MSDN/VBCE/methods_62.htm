<h2><a name="_vbce_rate"></a>Rate</h2>
<p>
Specifies the interest rate per period for an annuity.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
<b>Rate</b><i>(nper, pmt, pv[, fv[, type[, guess]]])</i></p>
<p>
The <b>Rate</b> function has the following named arguments:
<dl>
<dt>
<i>nper</i></dt>
<dd>
Required. Variant specifying total number of payment periods in the annuity. For example, if you make monthly payments on a four-year car loan, your loan has a total of 4 * 12 (or 48) payment periods.</dd>
<dt>
<i>pmt</i></dt>
<dd>
Required. Variant specifying payment to be made each period. Payments usually contain principal and interest that does not change over the life of the annuity.</dd>
<dt>
<i>pv</i></dt>
<dd>
Required. Variant specifying present value, or value today, of a series of future payments or receipts. For example, when you borrow money to buy a car, the loan amount is the present value to the lender of the monthly car payments you will make.</dd>
<dt>
<i>fv</i></dt>
<dd>
Optional. Variant specifying future value or cash balance you want after you make the final payment. For example, the future value of a loan is $0 because that is its value after the final payment. However, if you want to save $50,000 over 18 years for your child's education, then $50,000 is the future value. If omitted, 0 is assumed.</dd>
<dt>
<i>type</i></dt>
<dd>
Optional. Variant specifying a number indicating when payments are due. Use 0 if payments are due at the end of the payment period, or use 1 if payments are due at the beginning of the period. If omitted, 0 is assumed.</dd>
<dt>
<i>guess</i></dt>
<dd>
Optional. Variant specifying value you estimate will be returned by the <b>Rate </b>function. If omitted, guess is 0.1 (10 percent).</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
An annuity is a series of fixed cash payments made over a period of time. An annuity can be a loan (such as a home mortgage) or an investment (such as a monthly savings plan).</p>
<p>
For all arguments, cash paid out (such as deposits to savings) is represented by negative numbers; cash received (such as dividend checks) is represented by positive numbers.</p>
<p>
Rate is calculated by iteration. Starting with the value of guess, the <b>Rate</b> function cycles through the calculation until the result is accurate to within 0.00001 percent. If <b>Rate</b> cannot find a result after 20 tries, it fails. If your guess is 10 percent and <b>Rate</b> fails, try a different value for guess.</p>
