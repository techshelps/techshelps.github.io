<h2><a name="_vbce_gotfocus"></a>GotFocus</h2>
<p>
Occurs when an object receives the focus, either by user action, such as tabbing to or clicking the object, or by changing the focus in code using the <b>SetFocus</b> method. A form receives the focus only when all visible controls are disabled.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
Private Sub Form_GotFocus()</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Typically, you use a <b>GotFocus</b> event procedure to specify the actions that occur when a control or form first receives the focus. For example, by attaching a <b>GotFocus</b> event procedure to each control on a form, you can guide the user by displaying brief instructions or status bar messages. You can also provide visual cues by enabling, disabling, or showing other controls that depend on the control that has the focus.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  An object can receive the focus only if its <b>Enabled</b> and <b>Visible</b> properties are set to <b>True</b>. To customize the keyboard interface in Visual Basic for moving the focus, set the tab order or specify access keys for controls on a form.</p>
