<h2><a name="_vbce_irr"></a>IRR</h2>
<p>
Specifies the internal rate of return for a series of periodic cash flows (payments and receipts).</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
<b>IRR</b><i>(values[, guess])</i></p>
<p>
The <b>IRR</b> function has the following named arguments:
<dl>
<dt>
<i>value)</i></dt>
<dd>
Required. Array of Variant specifying cash flow values. The array must contain at least one negative value (a payment) and one positive value (a receipt).</dd>
<dt>
<i>guess</i></dt>
<dd>
Optional. Variant specifying value you estimate will be returned by <b>IRR</b>. If omitted, guess is 0.1 (10 percent).</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The internal rate of return is the interest rate received for an investment consisting of payments and receipts that occur at regular intervals.</p>
<p>
The <b>IRR</b> function uses the order of values within the array to interpret the order of payments and receipts. Be sure to enter your payment and receipt values in the correct sequence. The cash flow for each period does not have to be fixed, as it is for an annuity.</p>
<p>
<b>IRR</b> is calculated by iteration. Starting with the value of guess, <b>IRR</b> cycles through the calculation until the result is accurate to within 0.00001 percent. If <b>IRR</b> cannot find a result after 20 tries, it fails.</p>
