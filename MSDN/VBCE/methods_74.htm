<h2><a name="_vbce_setfocus"></a>SetFocus</h2>
<p>
Moves the focus to the specified control or form.</p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
<i>object</i>.<b>SetFocus</b></p>
<p>
The <i>object</i> placeholder represents an object expression that evaluates to an object.</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The object must be a <b>Form</b> object, or control that can receive the focus. After invoking the <b>SetFocus</b> method, any user input is directed to the specified form or control.</p>
<p>
You can only move the focus to a visible form or control. Because a form and controls on a form are not visible until the form's <b>Load</b> event has finished, you cannot use the <b>SetFocus</b> method to move the focus to the form being loaded in its own <b>Load</b> event unless you first use the <b>Show</b> method to show the form before the <b>Form_Load</b> event procedure is finished.</p>
<p>
You also cannot move the focus to a form or control if the <b>Enabled</b> property is set to <b>False</b>. If the <b>Enabled</b> property has been set to <b>False</b> at design time, you must first set it to <b>True</b> before it can receive the focus using the <b>SetFocus</b> method.</p>
