<h2><a name="_vbce_commevent"></a>CommEvent</h2>
<p>
Returns the most recent communication event or error. This property is not available at design time and is read-only at run time. </p>
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>
<i>object</i>.<b>CommEvent</b></p>
<p>
The parts of the <b>CommEvent</b> property syntax are described in the following table. </p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=48%>Part</th>
<th align=left width=52%>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=48%><i>object</i></td>
<td width=52%>An object expression that evaluates to an object.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Although the OnComm event is generated whenever a communication error or event occurs, the <b>CommEvent</b> property holds the numeric code for that error or event. To determine the actual error or event that caused the OnComm event, you must reference the <b>CommEvent</b> property.</p>
<p>
The <b>CommEvent</b> property returns one of the values found in the following tables for communication errors or events.</p>
