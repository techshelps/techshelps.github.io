<p>
The Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 5.0 is similar to Visual basic 5.0 in both functionality and design. However, several Visual Basic features have not been implemented because of limitations in the Windows CE operating system. These limitations impose the following restrictions:
<ul>
<li>
Visual Basic class files are not supported.</li>
<li>
Only one .bas file is supported.</li>
<li>
No support for ActiveX controls written in Visual Basic 5.0.</li>
<li>
Help is not supported.</li>
<li>
Language errors are displayed only at run time.</li>
<li>
Designers and insertable objects, such as Excel, are not supported.</li>
<li>
The <b>Auto</b> <b>Increment</b> checkbox on the <b>Make</b> tab is not supported.</li>
<li>
Arrays may not get initialized when there is little free memory.</li>
<li>
The <b>Debug</b> object is not supported.</li>
<li>
The standard toolbar cannot be customized. </li>
<li>
Duplicate sub or functions, such as a sub-sub, function-function, or sub-function combination, are not supported.</li>
<li>
Adding an existing Visual Basic 5.0 code module or existing Visual Basic 5.0 forms, including those listed in the "Add Form" dialog, to a Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 5.0 project is generally not supported because the code module or form may use controls and/or language syntax not supported by Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 5.0 .</li>
</ul>
