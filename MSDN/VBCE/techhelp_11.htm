<p>
Microsoft creates the technology, while Microsoft Certified Solution Providers (MCSPs) develop the actual solutions for customers all over the world. MCSPs are, in fact, Microsoft's virtual service and support team. From small organizations to companies of 1,000 or more employees, MCSPs use Microsoft products as the building blocks to offer such value-added services as integration, consulting, software customization, application development, and technical training and support. MCSPs have Microsoft Certified Professionals on staff and often specialize in an industry or a specific solution. Therefore, they are the most knowledgeable on those applications and can offer expert, comprehensive support. And in most cases, they can bring their expertise right on-site, offering you all the benefits of a local support presence.
