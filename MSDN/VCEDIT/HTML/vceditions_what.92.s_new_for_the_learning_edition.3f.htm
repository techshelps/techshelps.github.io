<h1><a name="vceditions_what.92.s_new_for_the_learning_edition.3f"></a>What's Included in the Visual C++ Standard Edition?</h1>
<p>
The Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 Standard Edition (formerly called the Learning Edition) includes a rich variety of professional tools to help you learn C, C++, and many other professional technologies such as MFC, OLE, ODBC, DAO, ActiveX, and COM.</p>
<p>
The Standard Edition is packaged with a book and C++ tutorial (on CD-ROM) that helps you learn how to use Visual C++. </p>
<p>
The Standard Edition is comprised of features found in the <a href="vceditions_what.92.s_new_for_the_professional_edition.3f.htm">Professional Edition</a>, with the following exceptions:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Static linkage to MFC<p class=tl>
Static linking allows you to include the MFC library in your program’s compilation, thereby resolving MFC references at link time and not at run time.&nbsp; So, if you write programs that use the MFC library with the Standard Edition, the resulting executable will require that the MFC library code be available as a shared library (DLL).&nbsp; Calls to the MFC library that you place in your code are resolved at run time and not at link time.</P></li>
<li>
Code optimization<p class=tl>
Code optimization, implemented with the compiler’s /O compiler options, make your final executable files (EXE) and dynamic-link files (DLL) smaller or faster.</P></li>
<li>
Profiling<p class=tl>
The Visual C++ source code profiler helps you determine which parts of your code could benefit from performance modifications.</P></li>
<li>
The RemoteData control and other data-bound controls<p class=tl>
The RemoteData control and the DBGrid, DBCombo, and DBList controls are for use with data-access clients and are only found in the Professional and Enterprise editions.</P></li>
<li>
Custom AppWizard<p class=tl>
The Custom AppWizard project type allows you to create an AppWizard that you will subsequently use to create projects with customized starter files.</P></li>
<li>
InstallShield<p class=tl>
InstallShield is a program packaged with the Professional and Enterprise editions that lets you package your application in a setup program for easy installation.</P></li>
<li>
Cluster Resource Wizard<p class=tl>
The Cluster Resource Type Wizard generates two projects for implementing a Microsoft Cluster Server resource type. Writing a custom resource type allows an application to be more closely managed and monitored by MSCS. The two generated projects are a resource DLL project, which produces a DLL which is loaded by an MSCS resource monitor on a cluster node to manage and monitor the application, and a Cluster Administrator extension DLL project, which produces a COM in-proc server DLL for providing a user interface for managing resources of this new type.</P></li>
</ul>
