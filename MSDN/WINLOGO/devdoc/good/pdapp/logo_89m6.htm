<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
<b>Requirement</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo)</p>
<p>
Your application must be compatible with the <b>High Contrast</b> option, which indicates that the user wants a high degree of legibility. When this option is set, the application must use only system colors selected through Control Panel or other colors that the user can customize. Because documents are typically shared, a user must not be required to alter a document to adjust the colors drawn on the screen. System colors must be used in their proper foreground/background combinations.</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
To determine how much space the tray takes up on the screen and how much is left over, use either the <b>GetSystemMetrics</b> function to query SM_CXFULLSCREEN and SM_CYFULLSCREEN or use the <b>SystemParametersInfo</b> function to query SPI_GETWORKAREA.</p>
<h4>Exceptions</h4>
<p>
Palettes where the user selects a color may continue to display their full range of fixed colors. Games and certain multimedia applications may have aesthetic and design considerations, such as custom dialog boxes and user interface elements where system settings are inappropriate. Games, certain multimedia applications, and inherently graphical applications such as image editing tools may also be exceptions to color requirements. These are judged on a case-by-case basis. You must detail these exceptions in your Vendor Questionnaire.  </p>
<p>
<a href="logo_23ub.htm">Java applications</a> are temporarily exempt from supporting High Contrast. Vendors should expect this temporary exemption to be removed from future versions of the Logo program when popular class libraries such as AFC 4.0 provide support for this feature. </p>

See <a href="logo_04fo.htm">Pretesting High-Contrast support</a> for a description of pretesting you can do to ensure that your application properly supports High Contrast.</p>
