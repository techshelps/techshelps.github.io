<p>
Development tools are products such as languages and compilers that create executable files or interpreted code modules that mimic the action of executable files when used with a run-time engine of the developing application. </p>
<p>
These products must meet all the general requirements, with the following exceptions, and with the following additional requirements and recommendations:</p>
<h4>Special Requirements for Development Tools</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="logo_1gfn.htm">Make a development tool capable of generating logo-compliant applications</a>. (Required) </li>
<li>
<a href="logo_5cx8.htm">Submit a sample application for testing of your development tool</a>. (Required) </li>
<li>
<a href="logo_64z0.htm">Make it easy to create OLE containers and/or object servers with your development tool</a>. (Required) </li>
<li>
<a href="logo_6f8s.htm">Advise customers of potential logo-requirement problems in your development tool</a>. (Required) </li>
</ul>
<h4>Special Exceptions for Development Tools</h4>
<ul>
<li>
OLE drag-and-drop support is not required within the tool's design environment.</li>
<li>
Development tools that create Java applications do not need to be capable of generating applications that can meet all of the Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo requirements (see <a href="logo_23ub.htm">Java Applications</a>).</li>
<li>
Development tools are temporarily exempt from the requirement to expose the keyboard focus. Vendors should be aware that this exemption will be removed in the next update of the Logo Handbook.</li>
<li>
<a href="logo_2sc3.htm">Java applications must use and re-distribute the 32-bit virtual machine for Java</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="logo_794k.htm">Add-on products must be hosted by a 32-bit product that is logo-compliant</a>. </li>
</ul>
