<b>Requirement</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo)</p>
<p>
The Logo program is for 32-bit Windows-based applications. However, vendors can distribute 16-bit versions of their product on the same distribution media as the 32-bit Logo tested product. Vendors can only do this if the installer clearly distinguishes the difference between the 16-bit product and the 32-bit product that has qualified for the Designed for Microsoft Windows Logo. A message such as the following must be included:</p>
<p>
<i>Do you also wish to install Product Y? This is a 16-bit product that is not designed for Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft Windows 95 but must operate in this environment.</i></p>
