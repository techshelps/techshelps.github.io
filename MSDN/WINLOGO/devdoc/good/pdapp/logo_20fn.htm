<b>Best Practice</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo)</p>
<p>
You should ensure that the differences between the Windows 95 and the Windows NT versions of your application are minimal.</p>
<p>
Therefore, it is recommended that you review your application to ensure that it:
<ul>
<li>
Does not write to different registry locations on Windows 95 and Windows NT (registry values may also be different).</li>
<li>
Does not install different files (.dll, .exe, and so forth) on the two operating systems (or additional files on Windows 95).</li>
<li>
Does not install different versions of files that are common to both Windows 95 and Windows NT.</li>
<li>
Does not make operating-system-specific calls on Windows 95 that are not available on Windows NT. </li>
</ul>
