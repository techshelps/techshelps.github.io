<b>Best Practice</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo)</p>
<p>
An application written for the Windows operating system must exhibit its full functionality regardless of the file system of the partition upon which it is installed.</p>
<p>
For most applications, this guideline is not a problem (most applications are file-system independent). </p>
<p>
However, some applications and device drivers such as disk utilities and anti-virus utilities specifically rely on a partition type. For example, a disk defragmenter written for a FAT16 partition will not work for a FAT32 partition. The disk defragmenter should include support to defragment both FAT16 and FAT32 partitions.  </p>
