<h3><a name="_logo_provide_keyboard_access_to_all_features"></a>Provide Keyboard Access to All Features</h3>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
<b>Requirement</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo)</p>
<p>
Your application must provide keyboard access to all features.   </p>
<h4>Exceptions</h4>
<p>
Exceptions may be made in the following cases:
<ul>
<li>
Games that are dependent upon the use of a mouse or joystick. It is recommended, but not required, that games provide keyboard support where feasible. They should not require a pointing device except where it is unavoidable due to the nature of the game.</li>
<li>
CAD and similar applications that are dependent upon graphing tablets and other input devices.</li>
<li>
Applications that are entirely graphical, such as image editors, may rely on the MouseKeys feature built into the 32-bit Windows operating systems to allow users to move the mouse pointer. However, this is not acceptable for drawing applications that allow the user to independently manipulate separate text and graphic objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Exceptions may be made for minor features that are not required for operation of the program, when the major features in the application have keyboard access. All major features or functional areas without keyboard access should be explained in the Vendor Questionnaire.</p>
<p>
<a href="logo_23ub.htm">Java applications</a> are temporarily exempt from supporting full functionality through the keyboard. Vendors should expect this temporary exemption to be removed from future versions of the Logo program when popular class libraries such as AFC 4.0 provide support for this feature. </p>
