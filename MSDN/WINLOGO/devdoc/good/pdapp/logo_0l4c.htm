<p>
<b>Requirement&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>(Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo)</p>
<p>
All files and folders copied onto the hard disk must be removed (see Exceptions below).</p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Remember to remove .gid files created by Help. Create a zero-length (0) file with the same name at installation.</p>
<h4>Exceptions</h4>
<p>
User data files should remain on the hard disk.</p>
<p>
Resources that other programs might use, such as sharable DLLs, sharable fonts, and sharable registry entries should remain on the hard disk. </p>
<p>
It is better to err on the side of safety regarding other applications. If you are not sure whether removing a DLL might harm other applications, it is better to leave it behind. However, you must explain everything you leave behind when you submit your application for testing. The proper place to do this is in the Vendor Questionnaire.</p>
