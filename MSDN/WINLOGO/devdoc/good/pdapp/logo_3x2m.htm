<p>
The Logo does <b>NOT</b> mean that Microsoft or the testing laboratory endorses or certifies your product. </p>
<p>
Please note that the license agreement states:</p>
<p class=indent1>
YOU MAY ONLY USE THE LOGO AS A SYMBOL THAT YOUR PRODUCT IS COMPATIBLE WITH MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT AND WINDOWS 95. YOU MAY NOT EXPLICITLY STATE OR IMPLY THAT MICROSOFT OR THE TESTING ORGANIZATION IN ANY WAY ENDORSES YOUR PRODUCT. ALSO, THE WINDOWS NT AND WINDOWS 95 LOGO PROGRAM IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A "CERTIFICATION" PROGRAM, THAT IS, THE LOGO DOES NOT REPRESENT THAT MICROSOFT OR THE TESTING ORGANIZATION CERTIFIES YOUR PRODUCT(S) IN ANY WAY.</p>
<p>
Software applications are tested by an independent laboratory, VeriTest, Inc. (<a href="http://www.veritest.com/microsoft.htm">http://www.veritest.com/microsoft.htm</a> or send e-mail to logolab@veritest.com).</p>
<p>
The Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo indicates that a software product provides all the features outlined in this documentation, but it is not a quality assurance seal. Neither Microsoft nor the testing organization will be testing the quality of your product or ensuring that it is bug-free. The testing organization's job is to ensure that your product has full functionality, that the Logo features are present, and that your product is not generating frequent faults or system crashes.</p>
