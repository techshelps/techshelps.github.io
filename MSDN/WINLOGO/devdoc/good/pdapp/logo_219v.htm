<p>
Add-on products are accessory products, such as wizards, templates, and macros, that are not executable files. </p>
<p>
A separate add-on product is packaged and marketed separately from the product it supports. If a wizard, template, or macro is always packaged only with the 32-bit product it supports, it is considered part of that product for purposes of the Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo testing. </p>
<h4>Special Requirement for Add-On Products</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="logo_794k.htm">Host an add-on product on 32-bit products that are logo-compliant</a>. (Required) </li>
</ul>
<h4>General Requirements</h4>
<p>
An add-on product, by definition, does not have to provide an executable file (.exe). With that exception, add-on products must follow all Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo requirements that apply to any functionality they provide. For example:
<ul>
<li>
Any executable code included in add-on products must be 32-bit code.</li>
<li>
Add-on products must provide automated installers and uninstallers that follow user-interface guidelines.</li>
<li>
Add-on products that use native data file types must register them and their icons.</li>
<li>
Add-on products that use the mouse or keyboard, or that draw on the screen must support the Accessibility requirements.</li>
</ul>
