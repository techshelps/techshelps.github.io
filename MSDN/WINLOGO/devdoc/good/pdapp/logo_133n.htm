The Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo program was developed by Microsoft to help end-users easily identify desktop hardware and software products that are adapted specifically to run properly on Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;95, Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;98, and Microsoft® Windows&nbsp;NT®&nbsp;Workstation (hereafter referred to as Windows&nbsp;NT). </p>
<p>
Users can mix and match hardware and software products with the Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo and be assured that the products will take advantage of the new technologies integrated into both of these operating systems. As a software vendor, licensing the Logo enables you to use the Logo on your product packaging, advertising, collateral, and other marketing materials. This signals customers that your product has the following characteristics:
