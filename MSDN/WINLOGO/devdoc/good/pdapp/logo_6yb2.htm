<p>
<b>Requirement</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo)</p>
<p>
Your application must notify other software of the locations of the keyboard focus, either by moving the system caret or by using Microsoft® Active Accessibility™. </p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
This requirement enables the use of accessibility aids such as the screen magnification accessory included with the Active Accessibility SDK. This accessory will be included in future versions of the Windows operating systems.</p>
<h4>Exceptions</h4>
<p>
<a href="logo_492r.htm">Development tools</a> are temporarily exempt from the requirement to expose the keyboard focus. Vendors should be aware that this exemption will be removed in the next update of the Logo guidelines.</p>
<p>
<a href="logo_23ub.htm">Java applications</a> are also temporarily exempt from exposing the keyboard focus. Vendors should expect this temporary exemption to be removed from future versions of the Logo program when popular class libraries such as AFC 4.0 provide support for this feature. </p>
<h4>See Also</h4>
<p>
See <a href="logo_5kc3.htm">Pretesting exposure of keyboard focus</a> for a description of pretesting you can do to ensure that your application properly supports notification of keyboard focus location.</p>
