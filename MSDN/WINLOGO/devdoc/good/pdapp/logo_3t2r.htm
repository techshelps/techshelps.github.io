<h3><a name="_logo_support_long_file_names_for_files_exposed_to_users"></a>Support Long File Names for Files Exposed to Users</h3>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
<b>Requirement</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo)</p>
<p>
If the application saves files that are exposed to the user, the application must support long file names (LFNs) with all of the following required features:
<ul>
<li>
Users must be able to enter names of 255 characters including all uppercase and lowercase standard characters, embedded spaces, embedded periods, and so forth.</li>
<li>
Leading and trailing spaces must be stripped by the <b>Save As</b> command. To test this, enter a name with leading and trailing spaces, such as "####This is a test###", retrieve the file, and then make sure the spaces are deleted (the pound sign, #, indicates a spacebar space).</li>
<li>
Question marks anywhere in the file name must prevent the file from being saved. No error message needs to be displayed.</li>
<li>
The following characters must be supported anywhere in the name, including leading and trailing positions, without causing any error conditions:<pre><code>+    (plus sign)
,    (comma)
;    (semicolon)
=    (equal sign)
[    (opening square brace)
]    (closing square brace)
 </code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
Support for leading and trailing periods ( . ) has been dropped from the Logo requirements.</p>
<p>
An LFN is 260 characters long, which generally includes:
<ul>
<li>
3 bytes for "&lt;driveletter&gt;:\"</li>
<li>
255 bytes for the file name and extension </li>
<li>
2 bytes for the null terminator </li>
</ul>
<p>
A Uniform Naming Convention (UNC) path has 2 bytes for "\\" instead of 3 bytes for "&lt;driveletter&gt;:\", and the path may not include an extension (file type).</p>

See <a href="logo_90qc.htm">Pretesting UNC and LFN support</a> for a description of pretesting you can do to ensure that your application provides proper UNC and LFN support.</p>
