<b>Requirement</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo)</p>
<p>
Certain interactive entertainment authoring tools that are intended only for authoring non-file-based multimedia applications are not required to create applications that support OLE and UNC paths (see <a href="logo_3m9f.htm">Non-File-Based Applications</a>). </p>
<p>
However, the developer of this kind of tool must advise customers that if they create a file-based application using this tool (whether or not they use other tools), the application must meet the file-based requirements, including OLE support, to be eligible for the Designed for Microsoft Windows Logo. </p>
<p>
As with other development tools, a sample application must be submitted in uncompiled form for testing.</p>
