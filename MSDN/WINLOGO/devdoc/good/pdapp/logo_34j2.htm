Notification of testing results is a multistep process:
<ul>
<li>
You will receive test results from VeriTest within eight (8) business days from when your complete application package is received. </li>
<li>
If you chose the Confidentiality Option in VeriTest's Testing Agreement (see <a href="logo_0aqz.htm">Paperwork</a>), you must provide VeriTest a signed release form before VeriTest will forward the test results to Microsoft. If you have not chosen the Confidentiality Option, VeriTest will send Microsoft a copy of the test results at the same time it sends them to you.</li>
<li>
If your product passed testing, VeriTest will also send to Microsoft the license agreement that you previously signed and submitted with your product testing to VeriTest. Again, if you chose the Confidentiality Option, VeriTest will not send anything to Microsoft until you have provided a signed release form.</li>
<li>
Microsoft will then sign the license agreement and send it to the person designated as the marketing contact in the Vendor Questionnaire you submitted. <p>
If your company already has product(s) licensed to use the Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo, Microsoft will send you an update to the license after we receive your positive test results. This update will reflect the addition of the new product(s) to the license. Your signature on this update is required to complete the process.
</li>
<li>
Now you can use the Logo!</li>
</ul>
