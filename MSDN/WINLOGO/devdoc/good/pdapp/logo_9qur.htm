<p>
Utilities are products such as shell extensions, disk optimizers, antivirus software, certain query engines, and accessibility aids for people with disabilities. </p>
<p>
Because utilities are considered <a href="logo_3m9f.htm">Non-File-Based Applications</a>, they are not required to provide OLE or UNC support.</p>
<p>
They must meet all other general requirements contained in this document with the following special requirements, and with the following exceptions:</p>
<h4>Special Requirements for Utilities</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="logo_2390.htm">Provide meaningful functionality on both Windows 95 and Windows NT</a>. (Required) </li>
<li>
<a href="logo_5jce.htm">Extensively test any utility that uses the Exclusive Volume Locking function</a>. (Required) </li>
</ul>
<h4>Special Exceptions for Utilities</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Certain components of utilities may be 16-bit, such as those that must use the Exclusive Volume Locking function, soft interrupts, or components that must communicate directly to 16-bit drivers. The user interface and other components of these applications must be 32-bit and use the Windows® 95 thunking mechanism to access these 16-bit components.</li>
</ul>
