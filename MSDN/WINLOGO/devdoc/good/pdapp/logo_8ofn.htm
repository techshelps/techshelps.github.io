<b>Requirement</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo)</p>
<p>
Windows NT runs on multiple hardware platforms. Windows 95 is a single-platform operating system. You must provide a version of your application that runs on both Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 95. You can ship multiple platform versions (for example, different binaries that work on platforms such as Intel <i>x</i>86 or Alpha AXP) of your application in the same package. All multiple platform versions can be submitted simultaneously for testing.
<ul>
<li>
If your product can be installed on multiple platforms from a single distribution media (for example, a CD-ROM), the installer must automatically detect the platform. It is not acceptable to ask the user which platform to install.</li>
<li>
If you ship your application in a multiple-platform package that displays the Logo, you must include in that package a version of your application that runs on Windows 95. Similarly, any advertising or marketing materials you use that display the Logo must refer to a package that includes a version of the product that runs on Windows 95.</li>
</ul>
