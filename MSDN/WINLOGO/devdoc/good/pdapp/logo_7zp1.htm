The following is one of the tests we will run to test the stability of your product. You can use it to pretest your product prior to submitting for the Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo testing. 
<ol>
<li>
Find the Stress application in the Platform SDK (\mstools\bin\win95\stress.exe).</li>
<li>
Select the following options:<p class=indent1>
User Heap<br>
GDI Heap<br>
Wind32 Heap<br>
Menu32 Heap<br>
GDI32 Heap</p>
<p>
Set the Level to 2.
</li>
<li>
Start the Stress program.</li>
<li>
With Stress running, start your product from its icon.</li>
<li>
Exercise all of your product's functions, and make sure they are stable even when the system is under stress.</li>
<li>
Switch video modes "on the fly," and make sure your product is still operational.</li>
<li>
Test that printing and all other input/output functions supported.</li>
<li>
Close Stress, and then start one popular 16-bit application and one popular 32-bit application to see whether your product will still run without problems while these are active.</li>
</ol>
