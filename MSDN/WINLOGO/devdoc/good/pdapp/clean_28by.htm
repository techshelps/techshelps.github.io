<p>
Because many users are more comfortable and productive when using programs whose feature-sets have been tailored to their specific needs, you should consider what configurations of your application's feature-set would be useful under different circumstances.</p>
<p>
This is an issue that enterprise administrators generally take very seriously, because they have found that a disproportionate amount of their training and support costs are devoted to application features that few personnel actually need or use.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, of course, for some users, these same features may be vitally important in getting their jobs done. </p>
<p>
The solution is to make such features optional, and to give administrators a way to lock them down when they aren't needed.</p>
