<p>
<b><i>Non-file-based</i></b> applications are treated differently than file-based applications for Logo purposes. Examples of non-file-based applications might be utilities, multimedia reference titles, games, or applications like Terminal and Clock. These applications, for the most part, do not save files in any way, or if they do, they only do so to store user profile data.</p>
<h4>Exemption for Non-File-Based Applications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
If your product is a non-file-based application, the requirements to support OLE and to support UNC pathnames do not apply. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Distinguishing Between File-Based and Non-File-Based Applications</h4>
<p>
The following points distinguish between file-based and non-file-based applications:
<ul>
<li>
A non-file-based application is one that is <i>not</i> primarily used to create, edit, and save files (although file operations may be common ancillary tasks).</li>
<li>
The primary purpose of file-based applications is the creation and editing of documents. These applications include Open, Save, and Close commands, typically on the File menu of the application.<p>
For example, the primary purpose of applications such as Microsoft® Word and Microsoft® Excel is creating, editing, and manipulating files. Therefore, applications like these must support the requirements for file-based applications in order to be eligible to license the Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo.
</li>
<li>
Many accounting packages and Personal Information Manager (PIM) products are considered non-file-based applications. If you are uncertain about whether your product is considered non-file-based, please explain your case in the Vendor Questionnaire.</li>
<li>
Generally, applications that run exclusively in full-screen mode are not, for Logo purposes, considered file-based. An application that runs exclusively in full-screen mode is one that cannot, for example, be windowed or resized. </li>
<li>
Utilities are considered non-file-based applications.</li>
</ul>
