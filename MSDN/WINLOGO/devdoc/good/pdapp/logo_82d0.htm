The following is one of the tests we will run to test the stability of your product. You can use this test to pretest your product prior to submitting it for Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo testing.
<ol>
<li>
Start the Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe).</li>
<li>
Choose to view counters from "Memory", "Objects", and any other object-types that are relevant to your application.</li>
<li>
Run your application for extended periods of time, exercising all of your product's functions, and ensure that all systematic changes in system resources are accounted for.</li>
<li>
Switch video modes "on the fly," and make sure your product is still operational (not supported on Windows NT prior to version 4.0).</li>
</ol>
