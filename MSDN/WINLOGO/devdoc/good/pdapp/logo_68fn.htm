<b>Recommendation</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Designed for Microsoft® Windows® Logo)</p>
<p>
With the introduction of OnNow, applications will be run continuously, without restarting, for a much longer period than is typical today. For this reason, applications should ensure that they do not have any memory leaks. </p>
<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
A memory leak is defined as a memory allocation that grows without bounds. Memory leaks occur when an application opens a system handle and does not close it. A shortage of system resources resulting from memory leaks causes a decline in system performance and eventual failure.</p>
