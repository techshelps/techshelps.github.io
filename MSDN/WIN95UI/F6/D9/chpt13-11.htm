<h1><font size="5">Property Sheet Handlers</font></h1>

<p>When a user chooses Properties from the context menu of a file
object, Windows 95 displays a property sheet for that file type.
At a minimum, you'll see a General property sheet page with
information about the file, including its type, location, size,
and so on, as shown in Figure 13-5. </p>

<h4><i>The standard property sheet for a file object.</i> </h4>

<p>If you want to offer more information about files of a certain
type (whether the file has been checked by an individual, for
instance, or when the file was most recently backed up), you can
customize the property sheet for that file type by implementing
and registering a property sheet handler. I used a property sheet
handler to add an extra page to the property sheet that is shown
in Figure 13-6. This page simply serves to show that the property
sheet extension has been installed and registered for NWC files. </p>

<h4><i>A property sheet page added by a user interface extension.</i>
</h4>

<p>Like the other user interface extensions you've seen, property
sheet handlers must be registered in the Registry. These handlers
use the PropertySheetHandlers key to store their CLSIDs. Here is
the part of the REG file that registers the property sheet
handler for NWCFile: </p>

<p><tt>[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\NWCFile\shellex\PropertySheetHandlers]<br>
@=&quot;NWCPage&quot;<br>
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\NWCFile\shellex\PropertySheetHandlers\NWCPage]<br>
@=&quot;{771a9da0-731a-11ce-993c-00aa004adb6c}&quot;</tt> </p>

<p>To register the property sheet handler for all file types, as
I did in the PROPEXT sample, substitute an asterisk (*) for the
two instances of NWCFile in the preceding code. </p>

<p>You can also register multiple property sheet handlers for a
file type. In this case, the order of the subkey names in the
PropertySheetHandlers key determines the order of the additional
property sheet pages. You can use a maximum of 24 (MAXPROPPAGES)
property sheet pages. </p>
