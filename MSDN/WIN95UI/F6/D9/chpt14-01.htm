<h1>Chapter Fourteen:<b> The Shell Name Space</b> </h1>

<p>In this final chapter, we'll discuss the shell name space and
how developers can take advantage of some of the built-in
browsing functions in Microsoft Windows 95. The ability to browse
the shell name space lets you scan, locate, or display
information about the directory structure of the system or about
particular folders. </p>

<p>The <i>shell name space</i> is a collection of symbols, such
as filenames, directory (folder) names, or database keys. The
system stores all these objects and others in a hierarchical
structure and uses Windows Explorer to display the information.
At the root of this structure is the desktop. </p>

<p>A developer not as savvy as you are might say, &#147;So what?
This is just a glorified directory structure.&#148; Bzzt! Thanks
for playing. Next contestant, if you please. </p>

<p>The shell name space does include file system information, but
it contains much more than files and folders. It also includes
network resources, printers, Control Panel applications, the
Recycle Bin, and so on. This arrangement makes it easy for the
user to find an object without having to understand the
underlying directory structure of the file system. Figure 14-1 on
the next page, for instance, from the ENUMDESK sample (written by
Greg Keyser), displays the contents of a Control Panel folder. </p>

<p>This chapter presents two samples that demonstrate how to use
built-in functions to browse the shell name space. The first
sample, Greg Keyser's ENUMDESK, is written in C using the Win32
API. The second sample is MFCENUM, the version I ported to MFC.
In Figure 14-2, also on the next page, you can see the ENUMDESK
main window. Looks like Windows Explorer, doesn't it? </p>
