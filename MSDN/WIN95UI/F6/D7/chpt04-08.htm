<h1>Wizards</h1>

<p>What is a wizard? Although you might envision a person who
wears a funny, pointed hat with stars on it and makes magic
happen, in the context of an application the term <i>wizard</i>
refers to a piece of code that can walk the user through a series
of steps (in the form of dialog boxes) in order to accomplish a
complex task. For instance, many applications take advantage of a
wizard for their setup operation or for installing various
devices. Figure 4-4 on the following page shows an example, the
Add Printer wizard. </p>

<p>A wizard is basically a property sheet with extra buttons and
no tabs. In a standard property sheet, the user can navigate
among its pages by clicking tabs. There is no need to conform to
a special navigation order, and the user doesn't even have to
look at every page. In contrast, a wizard moves the user through
a series of dialog boxes in a specific sequence. The user can go
backward or forward, but the application determines the order in
which the steps must be taken or the information supplied. If the
application requires input for a particular page, it can disable
the Next button to prevent the user from paging forward. </p>

<p>Property sheets and wizards also present different buttons to
the user. A property sheet has OK, Cancel, and Apply buttons and
an optional Help button, which are used for all the pages in the
property sheet. The buttons that reside at the bottom of a page
in a wizard&#151;typically, the Back, Next, and Cancel
buttons&#151;apply only to the currently active page. </p>
