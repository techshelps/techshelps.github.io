<h1><font size="5">The RICHED Sample</font></h1>

<p>You create a rich edit control by using the CreateWindow or
CreateWindowEx function, specifying the RichEdit window class.
Because the common control library registers this window class,
you must call the InitCommonControls function to ensure that the
library is loaded before creating the control. To use rich edit
controls in your application, you must link with the COMCTL32.LIB
library. If you are writing your application in C, you must
include the COMMCTRL.H header file. Applications must also
include the RICHEDIT.H header file, in which rich edit controls
are defined. Note that four of the window styles you can use with
multiline edit controls cannot be used with rich edit controls:
ES_LOWERCASE, ES_PASSWORD, ES_OEMCONVERT, and ES_UPPERCASE. </p>

<p>To explore the rich edit control, I wrote a sample called
RICHED. (Do I lose points for uncreative sample names?) The
design goals for RICHED were a bit more challenging than those of
my previous samples: </p>

<ul>
    <li>To provide a rich edit control with a toolbar that mimics
        the Windows 95 WordPad accessory </li>
    <li>To allow the user to format characters as boldface,
        italic, or underlined (or as any combination of these
        three attributes) </li>
    <li>To allow the user to change the typeface and the point
        size of <br>
        the font </li>
    <li>To allow the user to left-align, right-align, or center
        paragraphs or selected text </li>
    <li>To support word-break and line-break procedures </li>
    <li>To provide serialization </li>
    <li>To support drag-and-drop operations </li>
    <li>To support printing </li>
</ul>

<p>The initialization code in the RICHED sample needed to perform
the following tasks: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Create the toolbar and the combo boxes on the toolbar </li>
    <li>Create the rich edit control </li>
    <li>Enumerate the available fonts, and fill the typeface and
        point size combo boxes with the font information </li>
    <li>Initialize drag and drop </li>
</ul>

<p>Figure 5-1 offers a sneak peek at the main screen that appears
when you start the RICHED sample. </p>
