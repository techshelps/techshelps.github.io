<h1><font size="5">Word and Line Breaks</font></h1>

<p>An application can use a word-break procedure to determine how
to break words and lines. This information is used in word-wrap
operations or when the user moves to the previous word or the
next word by pressing the Ctrl-Left arrow or the Ctrl-Right arrow
key combination. An application can send a message to a rich edit
control to replace the default word-break procedure
(EM_SETWORDBREAKPROC), to retrieve word-break information
(EM_FINDWORDBREAK), or to determine on what line a given
character falls (EM_EXLINEFROMCHAR). </p>

<p>A word-break procedure for a rich edit control groups
characters into classes, identifying each class by a value in the
range 0x00 through 0x0F. Word breaks can occur after delimiters
or between characters of different classes. A character's class
can be combined with zero or more word-break flags to form an
8-bit value. When performing word-wrap operations, a rich edit
control uses word-break flags to determine where it can break
lines. The following flags are supported: </p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">WBF_BREAKAFTER</td>
        <td valign="top">Lines can break after the character.
        This value allows wrapping after a character that does
        not mark the end of a word, such as a hyphen.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">WBF_BREAKLINE</td>
        <td valign="top">The character is a delimiter, which
        marks the end of a word. Lines can break after
        delimiters.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">WBF_ISWHITE</td>
        <td valign="top">The character is a white-space
        character. Trailing white-space characters are not
        included in the length of a line when wrapping.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
