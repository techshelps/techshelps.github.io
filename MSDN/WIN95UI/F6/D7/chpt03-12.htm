<h1><font size="5">Tree View Controls</font></h1>

<p>A tree view control displays a hierarchical list of labeled
items. Optionally, each item can have a bitmap (or a pair of
bitmaps) associated with it. You've seen this type of hierarchy
in File Manager (displaying directory information) and in
Microsoft Mail (displaying mail folders). The top item in the
hierarchy, which has no parent, is referred to as the <i>root</i>
<i>item</i>. An item below the root item in the hierarchy is
called a <i>child item</i> of the root. An item that has child
items is called a <i>parent item</i>. Child items, when
displayed, are indented below their parent item. (In fact, the
entire hierarchy of items is expandable and collapsible.) If you
specify the TVS_HASLINES style, you can connect the items with
lines. Figure 3-9 shows a tree view window that lists houses for
sale in various cities in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.</p>

<h4><i>Anatomy of a tree view control.</i> </h4>

<p>The first time I saw a tree hierarchy like this, I wanted to
implement one in my application. Like most of you, I figured out
how to do it on my own, but it was complex, and it was a pain. I
really wished that a tree hierarchy had been built into the
system. With Windows 95, it's finally happened. </p>

<p>In a tree view control, you can add a pair of bitmaps to the
left of an item's label, displaying one bitmap when the item is
selected and the other when the item is not selected. For
example, when you select a folder in Windows Explorer, the image
changes from a closed folder to an open one, as shown in Figure
3-10 on the following page. </p>
