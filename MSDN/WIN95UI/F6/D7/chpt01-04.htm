<h2>Common Control Notifications</h2>

<p>A common control notifies its parent window of an input event
by sending a notification. Some common controls send
notifications in the form of WM_NOTIFY messages. The <i>lParam</i>
parameter of a WM_NOTIFY message is either the address of an
NMHDR structure or the address of a larger structure that
includes the NMHDR structure (for tab controls, list view
controls, and tree view controls). Each common control has its
own specific set of notification values. </p>

<p>The common control library also provides notification values
that can be sent by more than one type of common control. All of
the common controls can send the following notifications: </p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">NM_CLICK</td>
        <td valign="top">The user clicked the left mouse button
        within the control.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">NM_DBLCLK</td>
        <td valign="top">The user double-clicked the left mouse
        button within the control.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">NM_KILLFOCUS</td>
        <td valign="top">The control lost the input focus.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">NM_RCLICK</td>
        <td valign="top">The user clicked the right mouse button
        within the control.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">NM_RDBLCLK</td>
        <td valign="top">The user double-clicked the right mouse
        button within the control.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">NM_RETURN</td>
        <td valign="top">The control has the input focus, and the
        user pressed the Enter key.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">NM_SETFOCUS</td>
        <td valign="top">The control gained the input focus.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Now that you have some background, the remainder of this
chapter will explore two of the new common controls: status bars
and toolbars. They are referred to as organizational controls
because you can use them to organize other controls. Before
Windows 95, you could find support for these controls from within
Microsoft Visual C++ through the Microsoft Foundation Class
Library; all you needed to do was click a check box. But these
were MFC classes. C programmers were still out of luck if they
wanted easy access to these controls. Now that the Win32 API
supports the organizational controls, everyone can use the same
status bars and toolbars that appear in the Windows 95 user
interface. </p>
