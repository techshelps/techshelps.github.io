<h1><font size="5">Supporting Help</font></h1>

<p>An application can display a Help button in any common dialog
box by specifying the appropriate flag in the <i>Flags</i> member
of the structure for that common dialog box. When the Help button
is displayed, the application must process the request for help
from the user. This can be done in one of the application's
window procedures or in a hook function. </p>

<p>To have a window procedure process the request for help, the
application must register the HELPMSGSTRING message identifier by
calling the RegisterWindowMessage function. (This is the same as
the action that the Find common dialog box needs to take to
process the FINDMSGSTRING message.) The application uses the <i>hwndOwner</i>
member of the common dialog structure in order to specify the
owner for the Help window in its call to WinHelp. </p>
