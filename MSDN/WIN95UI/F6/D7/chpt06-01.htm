<h1>Chapter Six:<b> The New Common Dialog Boxes</b> </h1>

<p>The Win32 API supports common dialog boxes, which Microsoft
Windows 95 provides to help the user perform functions that are
common to most applications: opening and saving files, changing
fonts, changing colors, searching for and replacing text, and
printing. Not only do you save time by having the operating
system carry out these mundane tasks, but you also automatically
conform to the look and feel of the system when you include the
common dialog boxes in your application. </p>

<p>These dialog boxes are easy to use. In the simplest case, when
you want the dialog box's default appearance and behavior, you
need only fill out a structure and call a single function. A
dynamic-link library, COMDLG32.DLL, supplies the default dialog
procedure and the default template for each common dialog box. If
you want to extend the functionality of a dialog box, the system
provides hooks and allows you to include your own template
containing any additional controls that you need. </p>

<p>This chapter describes the various common dialog boxes and
includes code examples that can help you incorporate these dialog
boxes in your Win32-based applications. The examples come from
CMNDLG32, a sample I wrote in C, which demonstrates how a
developer can manipulate the common dialog boxes using their
standard form or using hooks and custom templates. Figure 6-1,
which appears on the following page, offers an advance look at
the CMNDLG32 sample. </p>

<h4><i>The CMNDLG32 sample.</i> </h4>

<p>The new set of common dialog boxes found in Windows 95 has not
only a fresh look but also some added functionality and a few
other changes, as you'll see. But if you are an old hand at
programming the common dialog boxes supported in Microsoft
Windows version 3.1 and Microsoft Windows NT, you'll find that
using the new dialog boxes requires little or no additional work.
For example, the common dialog box sample I wrote for Windows NT
many moons ago worked without a hitch under Windows 95, with no
changes and no recompilation. If you are including templates and
want to take advantage of the new look, a simple recompile is all
you have to do. (If, however, you are including templates and
don't want to change your dialog boxes, you don't have to do
anything: just run the application, and your original dialog
boxes will appear.) </p>
