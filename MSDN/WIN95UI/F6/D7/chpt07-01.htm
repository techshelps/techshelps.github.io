<h1>Chapter Seven:<b> Putting It All Together</b> </h1>

<p>As you've seen in preceding chapters, the Win32 API for
Microsoft Windows 95 supplies a lot of new common controls. In
Windows 95, the showcase for many of these new controls and for
several of the new common dialog boxes is Windows Explorer.
Because Windows Explorer closely follows the Windows 95 user
interface design guidelines and because it includes a variety of
new common controls, many developers are likely to use it as a
model for creating applications based on the new operating
system. </p>

<p>This chapter builds on the previous chapters by pulling
together the new common controls into an Explorer-like
application that displays real estate listings for houses. We'll
look at two samples: CHICOAPP, the original C version of the
application; and MFCEXP, the MFC-based version. (Please note that
CHICOAPP and MFCEXP are not user interface extensions. Chapter 13
will cover Windows 95 user interface extensions.) </p>
