<h1><b>Chapter Five: Rich Edit Controls</b> </h1>

<p>Single-line edit controls are nice. Multiline edit controls
are nicer. But rich edit controls are the nicest of all. At its
simplest, a rich edit control is a window in which a user can
both enter and edit text. But that's not all. Just as a multiline
edit control provides a programming interface for entering and
editing multiple lines of text, a rich edit control provides a
programming interface for formatting text. With this new
Microsoft Windows 95 common control, a user can assign both
character and paragraph formatting (making words boldface or
italic, adding underlining, or realigning paragraphs, for
instance) and can include embedded OLE objects in the text. </p>

<p>To make these formatting operations available to the user, an
application must implement the necessary user interface
components. For example, if you want to let the user format
selected characters as boldface in a rich edit control, your
application must provide a mechanism to do this, such as a
toolbar button or a menu item. </p>

<p>Rich edit controls are based on multiline edit controls, and
they support almost all the messages and notifications used with
multiline edit controls. (A list near the end of this chapter
specifies messages that are not supported.) If your application
already includes single-line or multiline edit controls, you can
easily change it to use rich edit controls, and thus incorporate
their unique functionality. </p>
