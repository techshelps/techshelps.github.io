<h1>Chapter Four:<b> Tabs, Property Sheets, and Wizards:
Whiz-Bang Common Controls</b> </h1>

<p>Tabs, property sheets, and wizards are what I refer to as the
&#147;whiz-bang&#148; common controls. These controls are
extremely popular right now; it seems as if every new application
(or every new version of an existing application) is using
property sheets and wizards liberally. This is a nice development
for new users because a feature like a wizard can walk them
gently through a new or complicated task. </p>

<p>For those of us who have been programming for longer than we
care to mention, property sheets replace those awful, cascading,
modal dialog boxes that we've come to know and despise. You've
all had the experience of successfully navigating down through
all those layers to actually set a value, such as a network
address, only to discover that you've forgotten some key piece of
information, forcing you to cancel out of each and every dialog
box and then to navigate down again. This is when you pick up
your foam baseball bat and whack your computer monitor. (A tip
for the uninitiated: Don't use the wood or aluminum bat! Although
the immediate rush is terrific, you'll have a devil of a time
explaining it to your boss.) Now, however, by using a property
sheet instead of the modal dialog boxes, you can move easily
among all the different properties that need to be set rather
than backtracking through layers of dialog boxes. </p>

<p>This chapter covers the whiz-bang common controls that
Microsoft Windows 95 supports, and it offers some details about
how you can create and use them in your C application. At the
time this book was written, MFC did not support Windows
95&#150;style property sheets and wizards. </p>
