<h1>Chapter Three:<b> Image Lists, List View Controls, Column
Headers, and Tree View Controls: List Management Common Controls</b>
</h1>

<p>Several of the new common controls in Microsoft Windows 95 are
designed to provide a user interface for list management. These
controls range from straightforward lists that can display
various amounts of data (list view controls) to hierarchically
structured lists of items (tree view controls) to lists of visual
representations such as bitmaps and icons (image lists). In
addition, you can use a column header (also called a header
control), like those used with list view controls, to better
organize and display your lists. </p>

<p>This chapter shows you how to use these new list management
common controls in your applications. Because both list view and
tree view controls use image lists, we'll look at image lists
first. </p>
