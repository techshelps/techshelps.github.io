<h1>Property Sheets</h1>

<p>A property sheet is a window that lets the user switch among
pages of information to view and edit the properties of an item
or an object. Property sheets are also referred to as <i>tabbed
dialog boxes</i> (because you use tabs to navigate among modeless
dialog boxes); each page in a property sheet is analogous to a
dialog box. In a spreadsheet application, for instance, one
property sheet might allow the user to set both the font
properties and the border properties of a cell, with font
properties listed on one page and border properties on another.
The Windows 95 user interface includes numerous property sheets,
so developers who are aiming for a consistent look and feel
should seriously consider using this common control. </p>

<p>The PROPS sample, which I wrote in C, displays a property
sheet that lets the user view and change the properties of a
trackbar. Each group of properties is marked by a tab and appears
on a separate page. As you can see in Figure 4-3, this property
sheet has two tabs: Trackbar Range and Trackbar Page And Line
Size. When the user selects a tab, the associated page moves to
the foreground of the property sheet. For example, to change the
trackbar page size, the user clicks the Trackbar Page And Line
Size tab to bring that page to the foreground and then changes
the values as desired. </p>

<h4><i>An example of a property sheet.</i> </h4>

<p>Essentially, a property sheet is a system-defined modeless
dialog box, and each page is an application-defined modeless
dialog box. The property sheet is a container for the pages and
is responsible for managing them. It includes a frame, a title
bar, and four buttons: OK, Cancel, Apply, and (optionally) Help.
A property sheet must have at least 1 page and can have as many
as 24 pages. </p>

<p>Much like a typical dialog box, each page manages its own
control windows (such as edit controls and list box controls).
The application provides a dialog template and a dialog procedure
for the page. Each page has a label (the text displayed on the
tab) and can also have an icon. When the property sheet creates
the tab for the page, it displays the label and the icon in the
tab. If the property sheet has only one page, the tab for the
page is not displayed. </p>
