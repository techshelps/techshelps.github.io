<h1><font size="6">Chapter Two:<b> Trackbars, Progress Bars,
Up-Down Controls, and Animation Controls: General-Purpose Common
Controls</b> </font></h1>

<p>This chapter examines a group of new common controls that you
can use for a broad range of purposes, from measuring intensity
levels to scrolling through a list to changing a value. Let's say
that you want to control the intensity of the light emitted by a
computer-controlled light bulb. (You can stop by my house if you
think this is far-fetched.) You could use a trackbar to set or
vary the intensity of the light. Or let's say that your
application needs to process a number of database files, and you
want to let the user know how far it's gotten. You could use a
progress bar to show this. In addition to trackbars and progress
bars, Microsoft Windows 95 also supports two other
general-purpose common controls: up-down and animation controls. </p>
