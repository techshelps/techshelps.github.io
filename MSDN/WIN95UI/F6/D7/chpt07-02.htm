<h1><font size="5">Designing CHICOAPP</font></h1>

<p>I began my work by using samples I had written for previous
chapters demonstrating toolbars, status bars, tree view controls,
and list view controls. I didn't know how much time it would take
to simply integrate my samples, so, to get a head start, I
brought my computer home one weekend and started to work on the
application in earnest. I was amazed at how much I was able to
accomplish in two days. By the end of the weekend, I could
display and resize the major user interface components, all of
which were working in an orderly fashion. It did, however, take
more time to add all the features you see in the final version of
CHICOAPP. </p>

<p>My goals for this real estate application were to include the
following functional elements: </p>

<p>A toolbar (with ToolTips) for easy access to commands </p>

<p>A status bar displaying the currently selected city and the
number of houses listed for that city </p>

<p>A tree view control displaying the cities that have houses for
sale </p>

<p>A list view control displaying the houses for sale </p>

<p>Context menus </p>

<p>A property sheet for viewing and changing properties of the
various houses </p>

<p>Support for long filenames in opening and saving files </p>

<p>Figure 7-1 shows you the main screen of CHICOAPP, with a
selected listing for the city of Bellevue, Washington. (Remember
that the listings you see in these text files and screen shots
are purely fictional. If you are shopping for a house, don't rely
on this information!) </p>
