<h1>Progress Bars</h1>

<p>A progress bar is a window that an application can use to
visually track the progress of a lengthy operation such as an
installation or a file copying task. A progress bar has a range,
which represents the entire duration of the operation, and a
current position, which represents the progress the application
has made toward completing the operation. The application sets
both the range and the current position (as it does for a scroll
bar) and has the ability to advance the current position. </p>

<p>The window procedure uses the range and the current position
to determine how much of the bar should be filled with the
highlight color. By default, the minimum range of a progress bar
is 0, and the maximum range is 100. The increment value is set to
10. </p>

<p>The PROGRESS sample, which I wrote to demonstrate how to
create and manipulate progress bars, simply creates one of these
controls, sets its range, and allows the user to start and stop
the process of filling the bar with the highlight color. I used a
timer to simulate a lengthy operation. Figure 2-5 shows the
PROGRESS sample. </p>
