<p><b>Nancy Winnick Cluts</b> is the fourth of the seven children of Bronislaw and Anne Winnick, and the only one who really likes 
messing around with computers. She holds a degree in computer science from Indiana University. </p>
<p>After college, she was employed at Tandy Corporation, pro-gramming in 6809 assembler for the Color Computer on a 
software product called DeskMate, where she got her first taste of working all night to meet schedules and squeezing every 
last byte out of code to make it fit in a very tiny space. </p>
<p>Nancy joined Microsoft in 1990. When the opportunity arose to work with Microsoft Windows NT, she jumped at the 
chance to learn all she could about the new Win32 API and to help developers write applications using Win32. In 1993, she 
joined the Microsoft Developer Network, writing technical articles about programming for Microsoft's newest operating 
systems. </p>
<p>Nancy resides in Redmond, Washington, with her husband, Jonathan, and her son, Nicholas. </p>
<p>The manuscript for this book was prepared and submitted to Microsoft Press in electronic form. Text files were prepared 
using Microsoft Word 6.0 for Windows. Pages were composed by Microsoft Press using Aldus PageMaker 5.0 for 
Windows, with text in New Baskerville and display type in Helvetica Bold. Composed pages were delivered to the printer as 
electronic prepress files. </p>
