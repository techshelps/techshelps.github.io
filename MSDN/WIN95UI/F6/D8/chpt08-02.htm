<h2>STK4Q94.XLS?</h2>

<p>The limitations on the length and content of filenames in
previous versions of Windows have understandably been a source of
much grumbling among application developers and end users alike.
How many times have you had to save a file with a name such as
STK4Q94.XLS or STJUL94.DOC when you wanted to use a more
informative description such as <i>Stock Report Analysis 4Q 1994</i>
or <i>Monthly Status Report for July 1994</i>? The good news is
that the most recent Microsoft operating systems (Windows NT and
Windows 95) will let you use those descriptive filenames. If you
are using the Win32 API to develop applications for these
systems, you will be able to support long filenames for your end
users. </p>
