<h2>Adjusting the Width of Edit Fields</h2>

<p>You need to ensure that you allocate enough space to
accommodate long filenames in your edit fields, list boxes, and
static text strings. In the old-style Open and Save As common
dialog boxes (in 16-bit Windows), for instance, the field for
entering a filename isn't really all that large, as you can see
in Figure 8-1. If a filename is fairly long, the user has to
scroll horizontally to see the entire name&#151;a task that is
even more frustrating without a horizontal scroll bar. Not
viewing the complete name can also cause the user to confuse
similar filenames. </p>

<h4><i>The old-style (16-bit Windows) Save As common dialog box.</i>
</h4>

<p>The design of the new common dialog boxes for opening and
saving files (in 32-bit Windows) improves the situation. Notice
in Figure 8-2 on the following page that the edit box in which
current filename and path information is entered or displayed has
been expanded to let the user see more of the filename without
scrolling. </p>

<p>In short, take a look at the dialog boxes in your applications
and be sure to update the width of edit boxes to allow for longer
filenames. Of course, if you use only the common dialog boxes,
you don't have to worry about this because the common dialog
library takes care of it. </p>

<p>An alternative to providing new dialog boxes to support longer
filenames is to use only nonbold fonts (which require less space)
in your edit boxes. You'll find that allowing enough room for 30
to 40 characters in a nonbold font is adequate for most purposes.
