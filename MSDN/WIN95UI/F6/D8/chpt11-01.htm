<h1><b>Chapter Eleven: The User Interface Library</b> </h1>

<p>Using the features of SHELL32.DLL, the user interface
dynamic-link library, is an easy way to extend the functionality
of the Microsoft Windows 95 user interface. SHELL32.DLL provides
functions that allow your application to implement drag-and-drop
operations, to gather information from the system about other
applications and files, and to use some of the interface's
special widgets such as taskbar notifications and access bars.
(The user interface and its features are sometimes referred to
collectively as the shell.) </p>

<p>This chapter discusses the programming techniques necessary to
use the functions included in SHELL32.DLL. To illustrate some of
what you can do with these functions, I created a small sample
named SHELLFUN, which demonstrates the following functionality: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Drag and drop </li>
    <li>The SHGetFileInfo function </li>
    <li>The ability to add, remove, and modify items in the
        taskbar notification area </li>
    <li>The ability to add, remove, and reposition an access bar </li>
</ul>

<p>When you access SHELL32.DLL, you must use the SHELLAPI.H
header file. You need to include this file at the beginning of
your application in order to use this library's functions and
messages. </p>
