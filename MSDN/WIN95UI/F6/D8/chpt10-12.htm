<h2>Using Built-In Tools</h2>

<p>The Registry Editor is a tool that lets you change settings in
the Registry. If you are like me, you will like the Registry
Editor so much that you will keep a shortcut to it on your
desktop. (No, I'm not kidding.) If you are like other,
not-so-masochistic people, you will take a look at it and shut it
down fast. </p>

<p>In most cases, users can change system settings through
Control Panel, without going into the Registry Editor. Actually,
end users should never edit the Registry unless it is absolutely
necessary. If you were to introduce an error into your Registry,
the computer could become nonfunctional. It is true that the
Registry can be restored, but let's face it&#151;if you were to
hose your whole system by playing with the Registry, would you
want to go back in? </p>

<p>But if you are writing your own application and need to add
settings to the Registry or make other Registry adjustments,
Control Panel won't do the dirty work for you. Once you open the
Registry Editor, you can use the menus to add keys and values.
You can also import or export Registry data. </p>
