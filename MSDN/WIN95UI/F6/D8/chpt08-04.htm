<h2>The FAT File System</h2>

<p>The FAT file system organizes data on both hard disks and
floppy disks. If you have a FAT file system running on your
computer, you have no doubt slammed up against its filename
convention, lovingly referred to as <i>8.3</i> (pronounced
&#147;eight-dot-three&#148;). This convention requires that a
filename consist of no more than eight characters, followed by a
separating period (.) and a filename extension of no more than
three characters. </p>

<p>The main advantage of FAT volumes is that they can be accessed
by MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, and OS/2 systems. The FAT file
system is currently supported on floppy disks and other removable
media. The major disadvantages of FAT volumes are the limitations
on the length and content of filenames and the lack of Unicode
support. (Unicode is a character-encoding standard used
worldwide, which helps to simplify the localization process.) </p>

<p>Valid FAT filenames have the following form: </p>

<p>[<i>drive</i>:][<i>directory</i>\]<i>filename</i>[.<i>extension</i>]
</p>

<p><i>drive,</i> which must be followed by a colon (:), specifies
the name of an existing drive. It can be any letter from A
through Z. </p>

<p><i>directory </i>specifies which directory contains the file.
It is separated from the filename by a backslash (\), and it must
be either the full path, including the root directory, or the
relative path from the current directory. A directory name
contains no more than eight characters (and can have an optional
three-character extension, preceded by a period) using any
combination of letters, digits, and the following special
characters: </p>

<p>$ % ` - _ @{ } ~ ` ! # ( ) </p>

<p><i>filename</i> consists of no more than eight letters,
digits, and special characters. It can include embedded spaces if
each space is preceded and followed by one or more legal
characters. For example, the string <i>disk 1</i> is a legal
filename. Bear in mind, however, that although a space is a valid
character in the FAT file system, many applications do not
support spaces in filenames, so it's not a good idea to include
them. Furthermore, FAT volumes do not distinguish between
uppercase and lowercase letters; the filenames ALPHABET.DOC and
alphabet.doc refer to the same file. </p>

<p><i>extension</i> consists of no more than a total of three
letters, digits, and special characters. It is preceded by a
period. </p>
