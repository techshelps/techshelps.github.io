<h3>Assumption: Filenames do not contain spaces.</h3>

<p>In the FAT file system, a filename can include spaces, as long
as each space is preceded and followed by a nonspace character.
This is not the case in the VFAT file system. You can now have a
filename such as <i>This One Has Lots Of Spaces </i>, which
includes several spaces between characters and a trailing space
character. </p>
