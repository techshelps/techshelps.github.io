<h1>Access Bars</h1>

<p>An <i>access bar</i> is a window that is much like the
taskbar. Anchored to one edge of the screen, it usually contains
buttons that give a user quick access to commands, applications,
or windows. Although this might sound a lot like a toolbar, one
key difference is that the system reserves the area occupied by
an access bar (just as it does for the taskbar) and will prevent
other applications from using that area. A user can have one or
several access bars on the desktop at any time. Try to use access
bars judiciously; it can get crowded. </p>

<p>The SHELLFUN sample allows the user to create or remove an
access bar (also known as an AppBar) by choosing menu commands.
SHELLFUN's AppBar menu is shown in Figure 11-6. </p>
