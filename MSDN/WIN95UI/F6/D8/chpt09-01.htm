<h1>Chapter Nine:<b> Shortcuts</b> </h1>

<p>Shortcuts are one of the handiest features of the Microsoft
Windows 95 user interface. Keeping shortcuts on your desktop
makes it quick and easy to access the items that you use most
often&#151;a specific document, a favorite application, or a
printer, for instance. </p>

<p>A shortcut is a convenient way to reference an object in the
shell name space (the hierarchical structure of objects in the
user interface) without having to keep track of the object's
actual name and location. Figure 9-1, for example, shows the icon
that appears on the desktop when you create a shortcut to the
Paint program in Windows 95. (Notice the small arrow in the lower
left corner of the icon, which designates a shortcut.)
Double-clicking this icon activates Paint. </p>

<p>A user can create a shortcut to an object by using the
object's context menu or by using the File menu in Windows
Explorer. You can also provide shortcuts programmatically, as
part of your applications. You can set up shortcuts to many
different kinds of objects, including files, folders, Control
Panel, printers, and various applications. </p>

<p>Once a shortcut exists, the user no longer needs to know the
object's name and location. Double-clicking the shortcut to a
file, for instance, simply activates the file (the default action
for that file). That is, if the user has a shortcut to a
Microsoft Word document on the desktop, double-clicking the
shortcut opens Word with the file specified as the current
working document. If you set up a shortcut to a printer and then
change the printer's network location, the shortcut continues to
work. End users will still be able to print to that printer using
the shortcut and will never know that the server has changed,
because the location is transparent to them. </p>

<p>Shortcuts are also useful in installation or setup programs.
For example, the setup could place a shortcut to your release
notes or to a README file on the desktop. This makes it easy for
the user to browse through the information, and it's also more
likely that the user will actually read the file instead of
simply ignoring it. You could also provide a shortcut in a
multiple document interface (MDI) application to help the user
keep track of the last document opened. The user could
subsequently click that shortcut at any time to run your
application again in the context of that document. </p>

<p>Users can create shortcuts of their own and place them on the
desktop. After finding the object that is the target of the
shortcut, a user can set up a shortcut in any of these three
ways: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Use the right mouse button to drag the object to the
        desktop and drop it there. A context menu will pop up.
        Click Create Shortcut on the context menu, and the
        shortcut icon will appear on the desktop. </li>
    <li>Right-click the object to display the context menu (shown
        in Figure 9-2), and then click Create Shortcut. When the
        shortcut icon appears, drag it to the desktop and drop it
        there. </li>
    <li>Select the object, and then click Create Shortcut on the
        File menu in Windows Explorer (shown in Figure 9-3). When
        the shortcut icon appears, drag it to the desktop and
        drop it there. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you create a shortcut to another
shortcut, the system simply copies the shortcut&#151;it does not
create a new shortcut. Do not assume that shortcuts remain
independent of one another. </p>
