<h1>Chapter Eight:<b> Support for Long Filenames</b> </h1>

<p>Until recently, if you wanted to create and name a file in a
Windows-based application, you were limited to a filename of only
eight characters, plus a three-character extension. As a result,
your directories were filled with cryptically named files such as
STKREPT.XLS and STAT794.DOC. Microsoft Windows NT version 3.1 was
the first system to remove this limitation; now Microsoft Windows
95 brings the power of long filenames to the masses. This chapter
covers the file systems that Win32 supports and explains how you,
as a developer, can support long filenames in your applications. </p>
