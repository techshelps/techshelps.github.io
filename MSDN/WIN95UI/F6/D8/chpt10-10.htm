<h2>HKEY_DYN_DATA</h2>

<p>This key is used to store dynamic Registry data. The Windows
95 Registry supports both static data (which is stored on disk in
the Registry) and dynamic data (which changes frequently, such as
performance statistics). This dynamic data area is the mechanism
that allows VxDs to provide real-time data to Win32 applications
that can run remotely as well as locally. It also allows the
system monitor to provide performance statistics on remote
Windows 95 systems. VxDs are not limited to performance data.
They can provide any data they want to pass from Ring 0 to Ring 3
efficiently without hogging the CPU. The Registry supports
dynamic data by storing a pointer to a function that returns a
value (or many values). When a Registry call queries values
associated with a dynamic key, that function is called to return
the desired value(s). </p>

<p>NOTE: Dynamic keys have been introduced in Microsoft Windows
95 to handle dynamic Registry data. They are supported only in
Windows 95. </p>
