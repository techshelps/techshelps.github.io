<h2>The High-Performance File System (HPFS)</h2>

<p>HPFS organizes data on hard disks but not on floppy disks
(that is, you cannot format a floppy disk to use HPFS). In many
cases, accessing files under HPFS is faster than accessing
similar files under the FAT file system. </p>

<p>HPFS allows filenames containing as many as 254 characters,
including a terminating null. The names can include characters
that are not valid for the FAT file system, such as periods. You
can use spaces anywhere in an HPFS filename or directory name,
but the system ignores spaces and periods at the end of
filenames&#151;that is, the filenames <i>Test 1</i> and <i>Test
1.</i> are treated as if they were the same filename. You can use
the following special characters in HPFS filenames: </p>

<p>, + = [] ; _ </p>

<p>HPFS filenames do not require extensions, although many
applications still create and use them. An HPFS filename can be
all uppercase, all lowercase, or mixed-case. The case is
preserved for directory listings but ignored in file searches and
all other system operations. Therefore, a given directory cannot
contain more than one file with the same name when the only
difference is case. </p>
