<p>
By using the <b>IAccessible::get_accFocus</b> method, you can retrieve the child object that has keyboard focus. Keep in mind that only one object in the system at a time can have keyboard focus. This method accepts the address of a single <b>VARIANT</b> structure, which it fills to represent the call's result. After making the call, you can look at the value in the structure's <b>vt</b> member to find the result. </p>
<p>
If a child object has keyboard focus, then the <b>vt</b> member is set to VT_I4 or VT_DISPATCH. This value tells you whether to look for information in the form of a child ID or an <b>IDispatch</b> interface pointer, held in the <b>lVal</b> or <b>pdispVal</b> members, respectively. If the object had no children with keyboard focus, the <b>vt</b> member will be VT_EMPTY. </p>
<p>
Do not confuse object focus with object selection. For more information, see <i>Accessible Object Selection and Focus</i> and <i>Retrieving Selected Objects and Children</i>. For more information about the <b>VARIANT</b> structure, see <i>VARIANT Structure</i>. </p>
