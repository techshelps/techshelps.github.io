<p>
The parameters received in the <b>WinEventProc</b> callback function describe the object that is receiving the keyboard focus. </p>
<p>
There is only one focused child item in a parent. The focused child is the object that receives keystrokes at a given moment. Hence, server applications must only send this notification describing where the new focus is going. That is, a new item that gets the focus implies that the old one is losing it. </p>
<p>
Do not confuse object focus with object selection. For more information, see <i>Accessible Object Selection and Focus</i>. </p>
