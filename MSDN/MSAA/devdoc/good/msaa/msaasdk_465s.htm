<p>
Currently, the Active Accessibility SDK includes one example of a Visual Basic application that incorporates Active Accessibility technology, called "VBinsp." </p>
<p>
This application is very similar to the Inspect.exe C/C++ sample application, and provides a simple illustration of how a VB4 can incorporate Active Accessibility technology. The sample reports most of the Accessible information exposed by the object currently under the mouse pointer. </p>
<p>
The VBinsp sample code incorporates a timer control that it uses to determine the time increments between each query. On every timer tick, the code queries the object under the pointer and displays the results in a Visual Basic form. In the SDK, VBinsp is not an executable file. Rather, it is a set of VB source code found in the samples directory. </p>
