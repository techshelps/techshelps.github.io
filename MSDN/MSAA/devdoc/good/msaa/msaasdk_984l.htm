<p>
The <b>VARIANT</b> structure carries a wide variety of information used when calling functions through the <b>IDispatch</b> interface. For more information about how Active Accessibility uses the IDispatch interface, see <i>IDispatch Interface</i>. Since so many Active Accessibility API elements use <b>IDispatch</b>, you'll frequently work with <b>VARIANT</b> structures as well. </p>
<p>
Essentially, the <b>VARIANT</b> structure is a container for a large union that can carry many types of data. Before using the structure, you must initialize it by calling the <b>VariantInit</b> OLE function. </p>
<p>
The value in the first structure member, <b>vt</b>, describes which of the union members is valid. When you receive information in a <b>VARIANT</b> structure, check the <b>vt</b> member to find out which member to look at next. Similarly, when you send information using a <b>VARIANT</b> structure, always set <b>vt</b> to reflect the union member you're using to send the information. </p>
<p>
For more information about the <b>VARIANT</b> structure, please refer to OLE Automation documentation. </p>
