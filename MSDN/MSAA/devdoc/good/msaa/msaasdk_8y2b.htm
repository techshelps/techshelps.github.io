The following values (defined in oleacc.h) describe the states of objects within an application. </p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_ALERT_HIGH</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>It is important that this information be conveyed to the user immediately. For example, a battery level indicator reaching a critical level conveys truly urgent information, so a blind access utility should announce this information immediately, and a screen magnification program should scroll the screen so that this indicator is in view. This is also appropriate for any prompt or operation that must be completed before the user can continue. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_ALERT_LOW</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>This information is of low priority, so the user need not be immediately informed that it occurred; this can be a user option provided by the accessibility aid. For example, when Microsoft Word changes the appearance of the TipWizard button on its toolbar to indicate that it has a hint for the user, some users might want to know about this but others might not. Another example is helpful information that appears on an application's status bar when the user is in the middle of an operation. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_ALERT_MEDIUM</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>The user should be informed that this information is available, but the informational content need not be conveyed immediately. For example, when a battery level indicator reaches a low level, it should generate a medium-level alert. Blind access utilities could then generate a sound to let the user know that important information is available, without actually interrupting the user's work. The user could then query the alert information at his or her leisure. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_ANIMATED</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Object's appearance is changing rapidly or constantly. (This alert should not be used if the object's location alone is changing.) </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_BUSY</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Control cannot accept input at this time. </td>

<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_CHECKED</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Object's check box is selected. </td>

<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_COLLAPSED</b> </td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Objects within this object that have the ROLE_SYSTEM_OUTLINEITEM role are hidden. </td>

<tr valign=top>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Objects within this object that have the ROLE_SYSTEM_OUTLINEITEM role are displayed. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_EXTSELECTABLE</b> </td>

<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Object can extend its selection using SELFLAG_EXTENDSELECTION in the <b>IAccessible::accSelect</b> method. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_FLOATING</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Object is not clipped to the boundary of its parent object, and is not assumed to move automatically when the parent moves. An event must be sent whenever the object changes location in screen coordinates; if an object does not have this attribute, an event must be triggered only when it moves relative to its parent. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_FOCUSABLE</b> </td>

<tr valign=top>

<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_FOCUSED</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Item is focused. Do not confuse object focus with object selection. For more information, see <i>Accessible Object Selection and Focus</i> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_HOTTRACKED</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Item is hot-tracked by the mouse, meaning that it has a special appearance used to indicate the mouse pointer is located over it. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_INVISIBLE</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Object is hidden or invisible. This attribute is used for objects which currently not visible. Object which are never visible should be set as STATE_SYSTEM_OFFSCREEN. This state only reflects the items which are known to be invisible by the application. An object can be considered visible - the STATE_SYSTEM_INVISIBLE flag is not set - and yet be obscured by another application and not be visible to the user. For example, a object that appears in the main window of an application might be obsurced by a dialog. This object is considered visible. However, a list of files names in a list box might contain several hundred names, but only a few are visible to the user. The rest are clipped by the parent and should have STATE_SYSTEM_INVISIBLE set. </td>

<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_MARQUEED</b> </td>

<tr valign=top>

<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_MULTISELECTABLE</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Object can accept multiple selected items (that is, SELFLAG_ADDSELECTION for the <b>IAccessible::accSelect</b> method is valid). </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_OFFSCREEN</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>This object has no on-screen representation. A sound or alert object would have this state. </td>

<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_PRESSED</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Item is pressed. </td>

</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Object or child can use Text To Speech (TTS) to voice itself. A speech-based accessibility aid would be advised not to announce information when this object is focused. This would be very frequent, and would be very distracting. However, when the focus is not on this object and it is referenced, the accessibility aid can provide information about the object for screen review purposes. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td colspan=2 width=100%><b>STATE_SYSTEM_UNAVAILABLE</b> </td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>Object is unavailable. </td>
