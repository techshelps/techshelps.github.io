<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
Accessibility for people with disabilities (or, simply, "accessibility") refers to software features that enable these users to efficiently use computer applications. Typically, helper applications (called "accessibility aids") or the Microsoft® Windows® operating system provide these features. </p>
<p>
Accessibility aids generally perform the following main tasks. 
<ul>
<li>
Screen reading. These tools for the blind provide audio interpretations of text and other visual elements on the screen. </li>
<li>
Screen magnification. These tools allow people with low vision to adequately see on-screen information. </li>
<li>
Input enhancement. These hardware and software tools support users with limited dexterity, enabling them to use different keyboard driver software or different input devices altogether. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Active Accessibility is the umbrella name for the architecture and interface standards that support the integration of accessibility tools with accessibility-aware applications. This subject is quite broad, because there are many forms of disability and many possible application tools intended to assist users with those disabilities. </p>
<p>
Active Accessibility provides the fundamental accessibility infrastructure and defines integration standards providing the most value with the least impact on supporting applications. </p>
<p>
This technology targets mainstream software developers, accessibility aid vendors, and other interested persons. This document assumes a moderate to high level of knowledge in Microsoft Windows software development. For more information, see <i>Where to Find More Information</i>. </p>
