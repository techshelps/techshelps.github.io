<H2 CLASS="h1">Alerts Used by Applications, NVAlert, and NVRunCmd</H2><P CLASS="t">Application programs and the NVAlert and NVRunCmd services can generate alerts using the Common Service Verb (CSV) <B>TRANSFER_MS_DATA</B>. An application or service can supply subvectors, which are required to build an NMVT, or it can supply the complete NMVT; in both cases the completed NMVT will be logged locally, and may also be sent on the connection designated for NetView if one is configured and is active. An application or service can also supply user-defined alert data, in which case the data will be logged locally but cannot be sent.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For information about how the NVAlert and NVRunCmd services work, see the <I>Microsoft SNA&nbsp;Server Administration Guide</I>.</P></BODY></HTML>
