<H2 CLASS="h1">Connections Used for NetView and RTM</H2><P CLASS="t">SNA&nbsp;Server can make use of NetView, a reporting system that runs on an IBM host (mainframe). NetView sends alerts between the host and the PCs that connect to it. SNA&nbsp;Server can also receive information from RTM, a 3270 and NetView facility that monitors the amount of time it takes for a host to respond during 3270 display sessions.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To send link alerts, link statistics, and application-generated alerts to the NetView program at the host, you must specify the connection on which the alerts will be sent. See SNA&nbsp;Server Manager Help for information about specifying the connection.</P>
<P CLASS="t">RTM data and NetView alerts sent to the host by 3270 users are not necessarily sent via the NetView connection. RTM data is sent on the connection for the session to which it refers, while 3270 user alerts are sent on the connection for the currently selected 3270 session.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For information about configuring SNA&nbsp;Server Manager to work with NetView and/or RTM, and information about configuring the NVAlert and NVRunCmd services, see the <I>Microsoft SNA&nbsp;Server Administration Guide.</I></P></BODY></HTML>
