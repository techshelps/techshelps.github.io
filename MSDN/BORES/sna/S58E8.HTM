<H2 CLASS="h1">Response Time Monitor</H2><P CLASS="t">During 3270 emulation, statistics are maintained on the time taken for the host to respond to 3270 client requests. RTM data can be sent to the host for collection and analysis; the 3270 user can also view a graphical display of the spread of response times on a particular 3270 emulation session. The time for the last transaction executed can also be displayed on the status line.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Use SNA&nbsp;Server Manager to choose the way in which response times are measured and classified. RTM statistics for a particular LU are sent to the host that owns that LU rather than being sent on the connection designated for NetView data.</P></BODY></HTML>
