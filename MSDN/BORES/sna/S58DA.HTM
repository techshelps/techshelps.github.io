<H2 CLASS="h1">Link Alerts for SDLC and Token Ring</H2><P CLASS="t">When a Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) or token ring connection fails, SNA&nbsp;Server logs diagnostic information, called link alerts, about the connection failure. The alerts are logged in a log file that can be viewed using the Windows&nbsp;NT Event Viewer. To find an SNA&nbsp;Server log, in the Event Viewer, from the Log menu, make sure Application is selected. Under the "Source" heading, the application log file will have a name starting with "SNA."</P>
<P CLASS="t">The link alerts are also used to build a network management vector transport (NMVT) alert, which includes probable causes and suggested actions for the alert. If a connection on the server running SNA&nbsp;Server has been designated for NetView, and the connection is active, the NMVT alert will be sent on that connection.</P>
