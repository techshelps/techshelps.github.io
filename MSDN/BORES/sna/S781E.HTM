<H3 CLASS="h2">Boundaries and Measurement Definition</H3><P CLASS="t">RTM data is collected by comparing host response times against a series of four boundary values. Each time a host transaction occurs, the response time is compared with the boundary values, and the appropriate counter is incremented. There is a counter for each of the four intervals defined by the boundary values, and an overflow counter for response times above the largest boundary value.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can change the default boundaries — 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 seconds — using SNA&nbsp;Server Manager. You also can select which of three response time definitions to set as default. For instructions, see the <I>Microsoft SNA&nbsp;Server Administration Guide</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The response time is measured from the time the user presses Enter until one of the following events occurs:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">The first character of host data reaches the 3270 display.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The keyboard is unlocked.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The user is allowed to send data.</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">Again, a host can override the default boundaries and other host response time settings for any LU or all LUs it controls. (For more information, see "Host Modification of RTM Parameters" later in this chapter.)</P></BODY></HTML>
