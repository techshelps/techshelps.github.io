<H2 CLASS="h1">Running Setup Unattended</H2><P CLASS="t">You can customize your server installation by running Setup unattended using customized default settings that you specify in a Setup.ini file. If you're installing Microsoft Exchange Server on multiple computers for the first time and want to use the same configuration on all servers, you can run the Setup program in unattended batch mode.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Running batch mode Setup is useful if you need to install Microsoft Exchange Server quickly and don't want to be prompted to enter additional information. Batch mode Setup (Setup /q) can be used with an .ini file containing configuration settings so you can install Microsoft Exchange Server without user input. For example, you can use batch mode Setup to install Microsoft Exchange Server in offices that don't have full-time administrators who can set up the servers.</P></BODY></HTML>
