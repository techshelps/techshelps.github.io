<H2 CLASS="h1">Optimizing Your Server</H2><P CLASS="t">Your system's performance is also affected by the server's software and hardware configurations. You can minimize performance bottlenecks by adjusting software settings and balancing server hardware resources to support the expected load. You can use the Performance Optimizer to tune your server's software and the Performance Monitor to help you balance your server's hardware resources.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Before you install Microsoft Exchange Server and run the Performance Optimizer, you should optimize your disk subsystem. The following is the recommended disk configuration for a Microsoft Exchange Server computer:</P>
<UL><LI>A physical disk containing the operating system and the pagefile.</LI><LI>A physical disk for the transaction log files so they can be written to sequentially. To increase fault tolerance, you can mirror the disk containing the transaction log files.</LI><LI>A stripe set consisting of multiple physical disks for all other Microsoft Exchange Server components so the Microsoft Exchange Server databases can be accessed most efficiently.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
