<H3 CLASS="h2">Adjusting Software Settings</H3><P CLASS="t">The Performance Optimizer is an essential step in maximizing your server's performance. It selects the software settings that are appropriate for your configuration and places Microsoft Exchange Server files in the best locations. It configures your server based on the following factors:</P>
<UL><LI>The number of users that the server supports and the number of users in your organization.</LI><LI>The types of activities the server will perform.</LI><LI>The server's hardware resources, including the amount of RAM, and the number and type of disks and processors.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">For example, the Performance Optimizer uses the number of clients that the server will support to determine the number of database buffers to allocate for the information store.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You should run the Performance Optimizer after you run Setup or change your server's hardware configuration. In particular, you should run the Performance Optimizer after you:</P>
<UL><LI>Make changes to your server's disk.</LI><LI>Add a caching controller.</LI><LI>Change the amount of RAM.</LI><LI>Add a processor.</LI><LI>Change the number of users that the server will support.</LI><LI>Add or remove a component on the server.</LI></UL><H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Customizing Settings for Performance Optimizer</H4><P CLASS="t">You can customize Performance Optimizer settings by typing <B>perfwiz -v</B> at the command prompt in the Exchsrvr\bin directory. When you run perfwiz -v, the Performance Optimizer displays two additional screens that provide the following options.</P>
