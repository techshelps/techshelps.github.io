<H2 CLASS="h1">Uncompressing Installation Files for the Microsoft Exchange Client</H2><P CLASS="t">Installation files for client Setup are stored on the Microsoft Exchange Client compact disc in multiple cabinet files. A cabinet (.cab) file includes many files that are stored as a single file. To view or access a file in a cabinet file, you can uncompress the cabinet file by using a command-line tool called Extract.exe. For example, if you want to use Newprof.exe, you can uncompress it from the Exchng3.cab file.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To uncompress a file in a cabinet file and place it in the current directory, type the following at the command prompt.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Extract </B><I>cabinetfile</I><B> /e</B> <I>filename</I></P>
<P CLASS="t">where <I>cabinetfile</I> is the name of the cabinet file and <I>filename </I>is the name of the file you want to uncompress.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For more information about using Extract.exe, type <B>Extract /?</B> at the command prompt.</P>
