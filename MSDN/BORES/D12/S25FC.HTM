<H2 CLASS="h1">Mailbox Statistics</H2><P CLASS="t">You can use the Mailbox Statistics tool (Storstat.exe), to gather data about mail use patterns. This MAPI application analyzes a responding user's set of personal folders and then develops statistics, such as the number of rules in a folder and the amount of mail sent and received daily. You can gather statistics about users who run Microsoft Exchange with either the Windows 95 or the Windows NT Workstation operating system. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Then you can export this data into several formats, including .txt and .csv. A Microsoft Visual Basic macro that runs under Microsoft Excel is also included. You can this macro use to explore Mailbox Statistics results in more detail. Using Microsoft Excel, you can customize column names, convert the data into a chart, or otherwise manage Mailbox Statistics results.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can run Mailbox Statistics anytime. A frequency of about once every six months is typical. You can use it to establish use patterns, to determine when a server load should be re-balanced, or when you need data for the Microsoft Exchange Server Load Simulator (LoadSim) that more closely reflects your users. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Mailbox Statistics creates some load on the server, so it's best not to use it during peak hours. Also, you can divide your users into groups and spread your study over a day's time. For example, you can survey your accounting staff at 9 A.M. and your marketing staff at 11 A.M.</P></BODY></HTML>
