<H3 CLASS="h2">Client Maintenance Installation</H3><P CLASS="t">Once you've installed Microsoft Exchange Client, you can run Setup again to add or remove components as needed. For example, you can remove online Help for the Microsoft Exchange Client or add Schedule+.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Setup relies on the Exchng.stf file to perform maintenance installations, which include the Add/Remove, Remove All, and Reinstall options. Setup reads the Exchng.stf file to determine which components are already installed. Then Setup writes information to the file, identifying which components should be added or removed. If a component is removed, Setup removes all references to it from the system.</P></BODY></HTML>
