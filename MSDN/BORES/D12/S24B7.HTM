<H2 CLASS="h1">Public Folder Replication Strategies</H2><P CLASS="t">The Microsoft Exchange Server allows you to distribute and synchronize shared information through public folder replication. In other words, you can take a public folder and replicate it to different Microsoft Exchange Server computers. These folders are called public folder replicas. A replica contains the same information as the originating public folder but resides on other Microsoft Exchange Server computers, as well as on the originating server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">As mentioned earlier, the process of keeping public folder replicas synchronized is called public folder replication. Public folder replication ensures that each copy of a public folder contains the same information as the corresponding replicas on other Microsoft Exchange Server computers. You can specify replication at regularly scheduled intervals.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To replicate public folders, a Microsoft Exchange Server computer sends messages to all other servers on the replica list and updates those replicas. The remote replicas are updated with new messages, attachments, and any other folder contents that have been added, deleted, or modified locally.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The only distinct member of the replica list is the Home-MDB. The server with the Home-MDB attribute in the public folder directory entry is the delivery location for items mailed to the folder.</P>

<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Advantages of Public Folder Replication</H3><P CLASS="t">Public folder replication results in the following benefits:</P>
<UL><LI>Distribution of processing load and improvement of response time for users accessing information in the folder.</LI><LI>Reduction in the amount of wide area network (WAN) traffic necessary to access information.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Increase in the availability of information for users when their primary server is unavailable.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
