<H3 CLASS="h2">Restoring an Information Store to a Different Server</H3><P CLASS="t">An information store can be restored to a Microsoft Exchange Server other than the one it was backed up from. Use this method as a last resort to recover individual items (messages or folders) from a backup without restoring on a server that is in use. This method requires an additional computer that meets the hardware requirements to run a Microsoft Exchange Server. The server should not be connected to the organization and should have enough disk space to restore the entire backup. For procedures to restore an information store, see the <I>Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide</I>. In addition, note the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Do not use this method when a server fails. This method restores only the information store; it does not restore the directory.</LI></UL><UL><LI>When you are finished restoring the backup, reconfigure permissions on the mailboxes.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
