<H2 CLASS="h1">RPC Counter Tool</H2><P CLASS="t">The RPC counter is a performance tool that checks the number of RPCs from an application to a Microsoft Exchange Server. The RPC counter is used with clients running Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT Workstation, and Windows 95.</P>
<P CLASS="t">It's always important to design your application for maximum performance. Minimizing the number of RPCs for your application is the most important factor in improving performance. The RPC counter can alert you to less efficient code processes so that you can optimize these areas. Using the RPC counter to minimize the number of RPCs can improve your application's performance and decrease the load on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The RPC counter is useful for determining the number of RPCs that are generated by:</P>
