<H3 CLASS="h2">Communication Between the Client and Server</H3><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server services communicate with each other as client and server processes by using remote procedure calls (RPCs). <I>RPC</I> is an industry standard protocol for client/server communication. With RPC, clients and servers can communicate with one another efficiently and independently of the network type. An RPC is a routine that transfers functions and data between client and server processes. If the client and server are running on the same computer, RPCs are mapped to local procedure calls (LPCs), which are much faster than RPCs.</P></BODY></HTML>
