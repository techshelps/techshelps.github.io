<H2 CLASS="h1">Server Setup</H2><P CLASS="t">The way you set up Microsoft Exchange Server varies depending on whether you are installing it for the first time or adding and removing components such as Microsoft Schedule+.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The table on the following page describes important files used during Setup.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Caution</B></P>
<P>You should not modify files used during Setup because doing so may result in unpredictable behavior.</P>

These files are also used to perform a number of maintenance tasks such as adding Windows NT Performance Monitor counters. Most components have an associated .ins file. The most important installation file is the Server.ins file.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">.uns files</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">Server Setup reads uninstallation files to remove previously installed components. Every .ins file has a corresponding .uns file that is run when you select the Remove All or Add/Remove option during Setup. To remove a component, the component's corresponding .uns file must be available.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">.scr files</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">Script files are similar to installation files. Setup reads the .scr files and follows the instructions contained in the file. For example, if something goes wrong during Setup and services need to be stopped, Setup runs the Stop.scr file. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">Server.inf</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">Server Setup reads this file when it copies files to the server's disk.

It is used to record all events that occur on the server during Setup. You can refer to this file if you encounter problems during Setup.</P>
<P CLASS="tt">Your server may have two Setup.log files: one log file is created in the system partition the first time Microsoft Exchange Server is installed, and a second log file is created in the Exchsrvr directory the next time Setup is run. If there are two log files on the server when Setup is run, Setup appends the file in the Exchsrvr directory.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
