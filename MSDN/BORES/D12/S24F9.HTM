<H3 CLASS="h2">Requirements and Guidelines for Using Load Simulator</H3><P CLASS="t">The following are requirements for using Load Simulator:</P>
<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Client running Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 or later.</LI><LI>The version of the Microsoft Exchange Client must be the same as the Microsoft Exchange Server.</LI><LI>Your client computer should have at least 32 MB of physical RAM.</LI><LI>All Microsoft Exchange Server services must be started and running on each server.</LI><LI>Directory replication must be enabled between servers in the same site.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">To simulate as many users as possible on a single Microsoft Exchange Client computer, Load Simulator must use system resources efficiently. Typically, Load Simulator runs no more than 30 processes, each of which can contain one or more client threads. If you're using Load Simulator for performance analysis or benchmarking, make sure that your client hardware isn't adversely affecting performance results. Load Simulator reports that the response times for user actions should be based primarily on server load, not client hardware bottlenecks.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The particular type and number of simulated users that a Microsoft Exchange Client computer can support depends on a number of factors including your topology, hardware, and user definitions. Some important considerations are:</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Network bandwidth</H4><P CLASS="t">To run multiple simulated users on a single Microsoft Exchange Client computer, the network hardware on your client must be able to handle the number of users per computer you want to simulate. Also, you should consider running your tests on a private network so your data is reliable and reproducible.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Memory and pagefile size</H4><P CLASS="t">Each Load Simulator process and thread uses some amount of physical RAM and virtual memory. You can use Performance Monitor to make sure your simulated users aren't using too much system memory or causing excessive pagefile activity on your client computer.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Disk I/O capacity</H4><P CLASS="t">Some simulated user actions require disk access on the client computer. You should verify that your simulated users aren't exceeding the capacity of the disk subsystem on each client computer.</P></BODY></HTML>
