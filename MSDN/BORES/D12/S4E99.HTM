<H3 CLASS="h2">Creating a Favorites List</H3><P CLASS="t">You can also create a list of public folders that you use frequently to jump to your favorite public folders without searching through the entire public folder tree. The list appears at the top of the public folder hierarchy in the Microsoft Exchange Client. Creating a list of favorites is particularly useful when a public folder hierarchy becomes large.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can create a link to any favorite public folder or subfolder. Deleting a favorite removes it from the public folder favorite store, but does not remove the actual folder from the public information store.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For more information, see the Microsoft Exchange Client Help.</P></BODY></HTML>
