<H2 CLASS="h1">Using Public Folders</H2><P CLASS="t">Public folders provide a permanent storage place for information and allow the owners of the public folders to maintain the information.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can also use public folders to track projects or customers. For example, suppose you have 25 customers that you work with on a regular basis. By setting up a public folder, you can track each customer by including notes from meetings with that customer, PowerPoint<FONT FACE="Symbol">â</FONT> presentations, a link to the customer's Web site, or a feedback survey.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Using public folders, you can update information quickly and easily. After a file or piece of information has been updated, you can immediately post it in a public folder where users can access it. You can also restrict the users who can access a public folder and generate automatic replies to contributors based on the characteristics of the information they post.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition, users can organize public folders in a way that is appropriate for their needs by using different views. By sorting on characteristics of their information, they can create layers of information that they can access directly. They can also add their most frequently used public folder to their list of public folder favorites.</P></BODY></HTML>
