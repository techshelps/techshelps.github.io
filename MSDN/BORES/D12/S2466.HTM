<H2 CLASS="h1">Backing Up and Restoring Servers</H2><P CLASS="t">You should back up your Microsoft Exchange Server computers so that you can restore the servers with minimum downtime.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Use Windows NT Backup to back up the information store and directory. In addition, keep records of critical Windows NT settings such as the production server Internet Protocol (IP) address information and computer name. For information about backing up servers, see the <I>Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You need to back up and restore only the directory and information store because other components (such as the MTA and Microsoft Mail Connector) contain temporary data. For example, backing up the MTA would take an image of messages that are delivered seconds after the backup. Restoring this information would later result in duplicate messages. Some optional components, such as the Key Management (KM) server, have their own backup procedures. For more information, see the<I> Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>The values in the Windows NT Registry are also insignificant and should be reconfigured after reinstalling Microsoft Exchange Server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Service information is stored in the Windows NT registry. Therefore, when you restore the information store and directory, the other Microsoft Exchange Server services are automatically restored to their default settings. For more information about restoring the information store and directory, see the <I>Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide</I>.</P></BODY></HTML>
