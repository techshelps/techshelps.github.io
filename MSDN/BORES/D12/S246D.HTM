<H3 CLASS="h2">Installing Indexes for Languages</H3><P CLASS="t">An index for a language contains information on sorting and searching orders for folder hierarchies and the directory. The index is based on the language's conventions.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Installing a language index can minimize the confusion caused by differences in sorting and searching orders between languages; however, using multiple indexes can decrease server performance. To minimize the impact of multiple indexes, you can dedicate a single server for each index. You can also choose not to install languages that are needed infrequently or those that have similar sorting and searching rules as languages already installed on the server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If an index for a Microsoft Exchange Client language is not installed on the Microsoft Exchange Server, the server uses an installed index that is similar to the language, or the Windows NT Server language.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec0"></A>To install a language index</H4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    In the Administrator window, choose Servers, and then choose the server you want to install the language index on.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    From the <B>File </B>menu, choose <B>Properties</B>, and then select the <B>Locales</B> tab.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    Select the language to be installed on the server.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.    Choose <B>Add</B>, and then choose <B>OK</B>.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.    Ensure the Windows NT code pages for the appropriate language are installed, and restart the server.</P></BODY></HTML>
