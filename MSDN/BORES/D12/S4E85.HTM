<H3 CLASS="h2">Replicas of a Public Folder</H3><P><img src="xerk_d02.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">Public folders can be <I>replicated</I> to other servers in your organization. That is, an identical replica of a public folder can appear on multiple servers. This is called a <I>public folder replica</I>. Replicas contain the same information as the originating public folder but reside on other Microsoft Exchange Server computers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can replicate a public folder to a server in the same site as the originating server or to servers in other sites. Replicating public folders to other servers in your site is useful for balancing the load of users who are accessing a public folder at any given time.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Replicating public folders to servers in remote sites is a good way to distribute the load to the remote site.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For more information on public folder replication, see "Public Folder Replication Strategies" later in this chapter.</P></BODY></HTML>
