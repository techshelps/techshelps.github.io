<H2 CLASS="h1">Using Advanced Security to Secure Messages</H2><P CLASS="t">If your organization has installed the Key Management component on a Key Management (KM) server, you can use advanced security. Advanced security allows users who need to send and receive confidential messages to digitally sign and encrypt them. It provides a higher degree of protection than built-in features such as message sensitivity, which marks messages as personal, private, or confidential. Advanced security actually prevents messages from being tampered with.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Advanced security uses industry standard cryptography methods to provide the following benefits.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Digital signatures</H3><P CLASS="t">Ensures that messages aren't modified during transit. They also prevent forgeries by allowing users to place the equivalent of their signatures on messages. The recipient can then be certain that the message originated from the sender.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Data encryption</H3><P CLASS="t">Provides confidentiality by ensuring that only the intended recipients can read a message.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Organizations that use advanced security to protect highly sensitive information should understand aspects of advanced security such as how it works so they can be confident that Microsoft Exchange Server provides the level of protection users need for their messages.</P></BODY></HTML>
