<H3 CLASS="h2">Using the Setup Editor</H3><P CLASS="t">If you want to set up the Microsoft Exchange Client on many computers in your organization and use the same configuration on all clients, you can customize Setup options. When you run Setup, the Microsoft Exchange Client is installed with the settings you specify.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can use the Setup Editor to change default Setup options by editing the Exchng.stf file located in the client installation point. You can specify options such as how users will be notified of new mail, the RPC protocols binding order, and which information services are installed on the client. You can also use the Setup Editor to specify default profile settings that can be used with the automatic profile generator (Newprof.exe) during Setup. These settings are stored in a Default.prf file created by the Setup Editor.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Caution</B></P>
<P>Use the Setup Editor to edit the Exchng.stf file. Editing the file manually can have unpredictable results because the file has a unique way of tracking whether components have been installed.</P></BODY></HTML>
