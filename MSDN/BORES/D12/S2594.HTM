<H3 CLASS="h2">Using the Mailbox Cleanup Agent</H3><P CLASS="t">You can configure the Mailbox Cleanup Agent to move messages based on age limits. Within each recipient container in a site, age limits can be set on the user's Inbox, Sent Items folder, Deleted Items folder, and all other folders as a group. Outdated messages can be moved to the Deleted Items folder or to a special private folder so users can process the messages at their own discretion. After the Mailbox Cleanup Agent has cleaned out a mailbox, it sends a message to the user describing the cleanup operations that were performed. The tool also logs information for administrators to the Windows NT Server Event Log.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To enforce when deleted items are permanently deleted, the tool can be set to delete items from the Deleted Items folder. To allow your users to control which messages are deleted, you can configure the Mailbox Cleanup Agent to move messages to the System Cleanup folder. If the System Cleanup folder doesn't already exist when cleanup is run, the Mailbox Cleanup Agent creates it. The System Cleanup folder is a private folder in the user's mailbox that can remind users to delete outdated messages. It does not actually delete the messages; users can keep messages moved to the System Cleanup folder by dragging and dropping them into a personal folder file (.pst file).</P>
<P CLASS="t">The System Cleanup folder contains subfolders for each folder that is cleaned. For example, if you configure the Mailbox Cleanup Agent to move messages in Sue's mailbox to the System Cleanup folder, the folder hierarchy might look as follows:</P>
<P CLASS="t">    Inbox</P>
<P CLASS="t">    Sent Items</P>
<P CLASS="t">    Sue's Folder</P>
<P CLASS="t">    System Cleanup folder</P>
<P CLASS="t">        Inbox</P>
<P CLASS="t">        Sent Items</P>
<P CLASS="t">        Sue's Folder</P>
