<H2 CLASS="h1">Setting Permissions on Resources</H2><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server permissions give you a high degree of control over the amount of access people have to resources such as directory objects and public folders. The permissions you set depend on your organization's security requirements. For example, if you're the only person administering Microsoft Exchange Server, you can set permissions only on the most critical resources so that no one else can have access to them. If your organization has a large Management Information Services (MIS) department, you can assign administrators different levels of permissions to control who can access resources. You can grant administrators with the most authority permission to access the entire directory, while granting other administrators only the authority to create mailboxes. For more information about setting permissions, see your Microsoft Exchange Server documentation.</P></BODY></HTML>
