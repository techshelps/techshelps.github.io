<H3 CLASS="h2">Public Folder Store Structure</H3><P CLASS="t">The public folder store is the primary mechanism used by MAPI clients to access public folders. The folder hierarchy represents all public folders and subfolders independent of the information stores in which they are located.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="xerk_d13.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t"></P>
<P CLASS="t">The public folder hierarchy is stored in the information store. The Microsoft Exchange Server service provider uses an index made up of the public folder objects to list the top-level folders to return to the MAPI client. When a MAPI application is used to view the subfolders of a top-level public folder, the provider connects to an information store that maintains an instance of the folder contents. The provider then accesses the information store for all subsequent contents operations in that folder.</P>
<P CLASS="t">All tree operations are performed by the user's hierarchy server. Content tables and messages are provided by the folder content servers.</P></BODY></HTML>
