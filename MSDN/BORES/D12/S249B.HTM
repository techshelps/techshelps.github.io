<H3 CLASS="h2">Dedicated Public and Private Servers vs. Multipurpose Servers</H3><P CLASS="t">As mentioned previously, you can centralize responsibilities among Microsoft Exchange Server computers by configuring all the Microsoft Exchange Server computers to be either public or private servers. A private server has a private information store (dedicated to private mail storage and user mail), but no public information store.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Configuring separate public and private servers allows you to plan the hardware needs for a particular computer according to its role. In other words, if you know that a public server will have heavy use, you can use a higher speed processor, more RAM, and so on.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Separating public and private servers also concentrates the flow of public folder traffic. In this way, replication of the public folder hierarchy and contents takes place only between the public servers and does not impact the private servers.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Specify Separate Responsibilities for Servers</H4><P CLASS="t">You can assign different tasks to different servers.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>To separate the responsibilities between public servers and private servers</H5><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    Move all the public folders to the public servers by using the <B>Replicas</B> property page on the public folder or the <B>Instances</B> property page on the target public information store.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    For each private server, configure the private information store so that the public folder server is the appropriate public server. To do this, use the <B>General</B> property page on the private information store server object.</P>
<P>This step ensures that all top-level public folders created in the future are located on the new public servers.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    Use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program to remove the private information store from the public servers and the public information store from the private servers. To do this, delete the private information store object from the server container in the Administrator program. Also, move mailboxes off of the public-only servers.</P></BODY></HTML>
