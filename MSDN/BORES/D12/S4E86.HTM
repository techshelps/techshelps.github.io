<H3 CLASS="h2">Setting Up a Dedicated Public Folder Server</H3><P CLASS="t">You can set up a <I>dedicated public folder</I> <I>server</I> to store and process requests for information about the public folder, such as its hierarchy and contents. A dedicated public folder server does not have a private information store.</P>

<P CLASS="t">Having a dedicated public server means that other servers can concentrate their processing efforts on private message storage and user message transfers. Dedicated public folder servers still participate in directory replication.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Consider using a dedicated public server when there is a large amount of data in a public folder system or when frequent and timely access to public folders is critical.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you have a large site with more than 20 servers, you can benefit from not replicating the public folder hierarchy to every server, especially if public folders are created and deleted frequently. In this case, a private server may be your best option.</P></BODY></HTML>
