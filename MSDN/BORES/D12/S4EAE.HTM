<H3 CLASS="h2">Site and Recipient Addresses</H3><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server creates site addresses by using the organization name and site name provided during Setup. Recipient addresses are created by using site addresses. Site and recipient addresses are stored in the directory. It is important to ensure you have valid site addresses before adding mailboxes or connectors.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Site and recipient addresses are created for the following address types: MS (MS Mail for PC Networks), SMTP (Internet), and X400 (X.400). If third-party gateways are installed, other addresses can also be generated.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server creates a <I>distinguished name</I> (DN) for every object in the directory, such as a mailbox or distribution list. The DN is used to route messages within a Microsoft Exchange Server organization. If the DN cannot be resolved, the Microsoft Exchange Server uses the X.400 address of the object. It is important to retain the X.400 address for every object in the directory, even if you are not connecting to another X.400 system.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A recipient on a foreign system who has an address stored in the Microsoft Exchange Server directory is called a <I>custom recipient</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When a message is routed to a custom recipient, the DN of the recipient and originator are replaced with an address of the same type as the recipient. This ensures the message can be delivered to the foreign system, and a reply can be routed back to the originator with the correct address type. An illustration of the address conversion follows.</P>

<P CLASS="t">If the recipient is not defined in the Microsoft Exchange Server directory, the address must be in the form required by the foreign system. In this case, only the originator's address is converted to the native format of the foreign system.</P>
