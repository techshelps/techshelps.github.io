<H3 CLASS="h2">Public Folders in the Directory</H3><P CLASS="t">Each folder that you create has an entry in the directory and appears as a recipient. Public folders are represented in the directory as the <I>Public-Folder</I> subclass of Mail-Recipient<I>.</I> Each public folder is represented in the directory by an item of the Public Folder object class, as shown in the following illustration.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="xerk_d05.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t"></P>
<P CLASS="t">By default, public folders are hidden recipients. To view these hidden folders, use the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program. From the <B>View</B> menu, choose <B>Hidden Recipients</B>.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Displaying Folder Addresses in the Address Book</H4><H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>To display a hidden folder in the recipient's list</H5><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    In the Administrator window, double-click a public folder.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    Select the <B>Advanced</B> tab.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    Clear the <B>Hide from Address Book</B> check box.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Because public folders are represented as entries in the directory, you can send messages to them. In addition to mailing items to a public folder, you can post items in a public folder. Posting is a method of directly writing items to the information store without mailing them through the message transfer agent (MTA), as you do when you send a message.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) clients with the appropriate permission can also post messages in a public folder synchronously by using the information store application programming interfaces (APIs).</P>
<P CLASS="t">Public folders appear in the Microsoft Exchange Address Book Provider top-level container with other classes of Microsoft Exchange recipients. The <I>Display-Name</I> attribute indicates the name of the folder as it appears in the container. The object class is used to indicate to the client (through MAPI) that the recipient is actually a public folder, not another recipient class.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can create a special container for folder addresses. For example, if you want to group folders about a similar topic, you can create a container. To create a recipient container, select the public information store object and specify that this is where the recipient object is created.</P></BODY></HTML>
