<H2 CLASS="h1">Microsoft Exchange Server Setup</H2><P CLASS="t">If Setup indicates that it failed while installing Microsoft Exchange Server, in most cases you should reinstall Microsoft Exchange Server. If Setup fails but Microsoft Exchange Server seems to be working, there may be a problem with the network. After you've verified that the network connection is working correctly, complete the following steps to ensure that Microsoft Exchange Server is correctly installed.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    Turn off all Microsoft Exchange Server services.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    Restart the server.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    Run the Setup program and reinstall any components that Setup did not successfully install during the initial installation.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If Setup fails while you're adding a new server to a site, information about the new server may have been replicated to other servers in the site. To prevent the site's directory from becoming corrupted if directory replication has already been initiated, you may need to remove the new server from the site's directory before reinstalling the server. Complete the following steps to ensure that Microsoft Exchange Server is installed correctly in the site.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    In the Administrator program on the remote server you specified during Setup, delete the Server object for the new server.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    Run Setup again on the new server, and choose <B>Remove All</B>.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    Run Setup again on the new server, and reinstall Microsoft Exchange Server.</P></BODY></HTML>
