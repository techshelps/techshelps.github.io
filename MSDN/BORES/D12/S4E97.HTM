<H3 CLASS="h2">Deleting Public Folders</H3><P CLASS="t">Only folder owners can delete public folders. Deleting a public folder prevents further access to the folder and its replicas and removes the representation of the folder and its subfolders from the directory.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Public folder deletions can be recursive, so if you attempt a nonrecursive deletion of a public folder that contains subfolders, you receive an error message.</P></BODY></HTML>
