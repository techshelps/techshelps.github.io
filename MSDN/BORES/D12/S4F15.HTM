<H3 CLASS="h2">Resource Won't Automatically Book Meeting Requests</H3><P CLASS="t">If a resource such as a conference room does not automatically book meeting requests, the resource may have been put in the <B>Required</B> or <B>Optional</B> boxes instead of the <B>Resource</B> box. Entering resources in any address box other than the <B>Resource</B> box disables this feature in Schedule+.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Automatically booking appointments does not work when meeting requests are sent between Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffices and Microsoft Exchange Server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To ensure that resources can be booked automatically:</P>
<UL><LI>Inform users to put conference rooms in the <B>Resource</B> list box when requesting meetings.</LI><LI>Place the resource account in the <B>Resource</B> box of the <B>Select Attendees</B> dialog box so the resource is included in the <B>Bcc</B> box of the Meeting Request form and displayed in the <B>Where</B> box of the meeting request message. Schedule+ searches only for users listed in the <B>Bcc</B> box to automatically book appointments.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
