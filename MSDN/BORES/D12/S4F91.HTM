<H3 CLASS="h2">How a User Works with Mailbox Statistics</H3><P CLASS="t">The user opens the message and starts a copy of the tool, which opens the <B>Message Stores Statistics Analyzer</B> dialog box listing all the user's personal folders. At least one message store must be selected before analysis can be started. </P>
<P CLASS="t">By default, all personal folders are selected. The user can choose <B>Clear All</B> to cancel the selection and then select specific folders to analyze, or choose <B>Select All</B> to select all the personal folders. If the user chooses <B>Exit</B>, no analysis is performed.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When the user chooses <B>Start Analyzing</B>, the tool opens and analyzes every personal folder file owned by that user. The tool then generates statistics, including the number of folders, the number of rules, and the amount of e-mail per day in each folder. A progress bar and the folder names are displayed as messages are processed. </P>
<P CLASS="t">When the Mailbox Statistics tool finishes analyzing the folders, it displays the following message: "Results have been automatically sent to your administrator. Thank you for your cooperation." Optionally, the user can also save the results. When the user deletes the announcement message, StorStat.exe is also deleted. </P></BODY></HTML>
