<H2 CLASS="h1">Client Architecture</H2><P CLASS="t">The Microsoft Exchange Client user interface is designed to operate as a universal inbox where users can access information regardless of the information's source or format. The key component is the Microsoft Exchange Client Viewer, which provides the Inbox interface. Schedule+ and Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer are client applications that expand and complement the Viewer, adding scheduling and electronic forms.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Microsoft Exchange Client is based on Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI), which is a standard interface that defines a modular architecture. MAPI enables users to add and remove applications and information services on the Microsoft Exchange Client. Users can configure the information services they want to use in their messaging profile. In addition, third-party vendors can develop MAPI-compliant applications and services that can be used with the Microsoft Exchange Client to provide an unlimited number of services.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Schedule+</H3><P CLASS="t">Schedule+ uses the messaging capabilities of the Microsoft Exchange Client to send meeting requests and updates. Personal schedule information for each client is maintained in two places: in a schedule (.scd) file on the user's local disk and in a hidden private folder in each user's private information store. Another file, a hidden public folder on the server, maintains free and busy information for all users so it's available to everyone in the site.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Forms Designer</H3><P CLASS="t">The Forms Designer is a tool for creating custom electronic forms that automate business processes and provide a structure for posting and viewing specific information. For example, you can use the Forms Designer to create a purchase requisition or expense report form that users can use instead of conventional paper forms. For more information about Forms Designer, see the <I>Microsoft Exchange Server Application Designer's Guide</I>.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Optional Information Services</H3><P CLASS="t">MAPI enables information services, such as message stores and address books, to be added to the Microsoft Exchange Client. For example, users can store messages on their local disk by specifying personal folder (.pst) files in their messaging profile. The following optional information services can be used with the Microsoft Exchange Client.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Personal address book (.pab) file</H4><P CLASS="t">Stores frequently used addresses from any address list, as well as custom recipients and distribution lists that the user defines. Users can create a personal address book and store it on either a file server or their disk.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec4"></A>Personal folder (.pst) file</H4><P CLASS="t">Stores the user's personal folders and can be used to receive and deliver mail. This file can be stored either on a file server or on a user's disk.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec5"></A>Offline folder (.ost) file</H4><P CLASS="t">Stores a snapshot of public and private folders so that remote users can use mailbox folders and favorite public folders while working offline. When the user connects to the server again, messages the user has sent or posted are automatically synchronized with the server folders.</P>
