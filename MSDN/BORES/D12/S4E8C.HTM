<H3 CLASS="h2">Public Folder Hierarchy</H3><P CLASS="t">The public folder hierarchy is the tree structure that develops when you create multiple public folders by using top-level folders and subfolders. The hierarchy appears as a series of folders on the left side of the Microsoft Exchange Client Viewer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Users can choose a public folder from the hierarchy as they would choose any other folder in the Viewer. The information store on their public folder server supplies the information on the hierarchy structure.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The public folder hierarchy is replicated to all public information stores within an organization.</P></BODY></HTML>
