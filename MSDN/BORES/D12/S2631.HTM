<H3 CLASS="h2">Securing Your Internet Connection</H3><P CLASS="t">You can take advantage of a variety of features provided with Windows NT and Microsoft Exchange to prevent attackers from damaging your system over the Internet.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Configuring the Internet Mail Connector</H4><P CLASS="t">You can enhance security when connecting to the Internet by configuring the following on the Internet Mail Connector. For information about how to set these options, see the <I>Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide</I>.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Reject messages by IP address</H5><P CLASS="t">By default, the Internet Mail Connector accepts incoming connections from any IP address. If your Internet Mail Connector needs to communicate only with specific SMTP hosts, you can configure it to reject connection attempts from other IP addresses. This makes it more difficult for someone to mount an attack from the Internet against your system.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Set message size limits</B>    You can establish message size limits for the Internet Mail Connector. The default limit applies to both incoming and outgoing mail. If an incoming message from another SMTP host exceeds the size limit, the Internet Mail Connector stops writing data to disk and discards any remaining data. This prevents large messages from filling up the disk on your server, which helps reduce the impact of a denial-of-service attack.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Disable auto-replies to the Internet</H5><P CLASS="t">The Internet Mail Connector can prevent delivery of automatically generated replies, such as out-of-office replies. When users set up out-of-office replies using Microsoft Exchange Client, they frequently include a number where they can be reached and other information. In some cases, this information should not be shared outside the organization. You can configure the Internet Mail Connector to disable outbound delivery of automated replies globally or by domain.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Set delivery restrictions</H5><P CLASS="t">You can restrict which users in your organization have permission to send mail through the Internet Mail Connector. For example, you can grant Internet mail access to full-time employees. You can grant or deny Internet mail access to users by configuring the Internet Mail Connector <B>Delivery Restrictions</B> property page in the Administrator program.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec4"></A>Protecting User Accounts</H4><P CLASS="t">To ensure that someone can't gain access to your system by impersonating a user, use passwords on user accounts that are difficult to guess. This is especially important for accounts with administrative permissions. You should also limit the number of accounts that are granted administrator permissions.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec5"></A>Using Windows NT File System (NTFS)</H4><P CLASS="t">You can use Windows NT file system (NTFS) to restrict access to your files and directories and limit the amount of damage an intruder can do if they gain access to a user account. You can also enable auditing of NTFS files and directories through the File Manager. This produces audit records you can periodically review to ensure that no one has gained unauthorized access to sensitive files.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec6"></A>Using and Configuring Services</H4><P CLASS="t">You should run only essential services on the server and disable any unnecessary services. If fewer services are running, it's less likely that there will be a mistake in the service's configuration that an attacker could exploit.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You should also unbind unnecessary services from network adapters that are connected to the Internet. To do this, choose the Network icon in Control Panel, and then choose Bindings. For example, you can use the Server service to copy files from computers in your internal network, but you might not want remote users to have direct access to the Server service from the Internet. To use the Server service on your private network, you can disable it from binding to any network adapter cards. You can use the Windows NT Server service over the Internet; however, you should understand the security implications and licensing issues of using this configuration.</P>
<P CLASS="t">TCP/IP is the only protocol you need to bind to the network adapter card connected to the Internet. Make sure routing is disabled, so your internal network is isolated from the Internet.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you decide to bind the Server service to the Internet adapter card, then double-check the permissions for your network shares and the permissions for the files in the shared directories.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec7"></A>Connecting to SMTP Hosts with the Internet Mail Connector</H4><P CLASS="t">You can set up a Microsoft Exchange Server with the Internet Mail Connector on your bastion host that routes mail between your organization and SMTP hosts on the Internet. To minimize risk, you can make this a dedicated Internet mail server that doesn't contain user mailboxes. If an intruder does gain access to the bastion host, none of the data stored in user's mailboxes or public folders will be at risk because only messages in transit are stored at the bastion host.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you are using a packet filter, you must configure it to allow TCP connections to and from port 25 on the Microsoft Exchange Server.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec8"></A>Connecting to X.400 MTAs with the X.400 Connector</H4><P CLASS="t">RFC-1006 defines a mechanism for applications defined on the ISO protocol suite to run over TCP/IP. X.400 MTAs can use this mechanism to communicate over the Internet. If you are using a packet filter, you must configure it to allow TCP connections to port 102 on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer. Note that with X.400 authentication, passwords are protected.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec9"></A>Connecting Sites Using the Internet</H4><P CLASS="t">You can use the Internet Mail Connector, the X.400 Connector, or the Site Connector to connect Microsoft Exchange Server sites through the Internet. If mail must pass through one or more SMTP hosts to reach its destination, the Internet Mail Connector must be used. Note that data is not encrypted when it is sent through these connectors unless messages are encrypted using advanced security.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Site Connector uses RPCs to communicate between servers but does not use RPC encryption. If you use a packet filter, you must configure it the same way as you would to enable client access over the Internet.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec10"></A>Configuring DNS</H4><P CLASS="t">If you are using DNS with a packet filtering router, you must configure the router to allow user datagram protocol (UDP) and TCP connections to port 53 on the DNS server.</P></BODY></HTML>
