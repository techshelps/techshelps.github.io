<H3 CLASS="h2">Running Mailbox Statistics in Administrator Mode</H3><P CLASS="t">This procedure assumes that an administrator's mailbox (named StorStat) has been created and is available to collect results from users. You can check on the number of responses by opening the Inbox and viewing the number of messages containing "UserResults." When enough responses have been gathered, you can tabulate them by running the Mailbox Statistics tool in administrator mode.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you have results generated by an earlier version of the tool, store them separately from later results. With the results separated, you should receive no error messages caused by using the tool on mixed-version generated results.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you want to use the macro included with Mailbox Statistics, save your results in the Microsoft Excel .csv file format.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec0"></A>To run Mailbox Statistics in Administrator mode</H4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    At the command prompt, type: </P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>storstat.exe -a</PRE>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    Set the default messaging profile to the Mailbox Statistics administrator's mailbox, or select the profile.</P>
<P>You'll see a progress bar move as messages are processed. When all messages are processed, the <B>Summary Results</B> dialog box appears.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    Choose <B>Save As</B> to save results in a location under a file name you specify, or choose <B>Exit</B> to disregard these results.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Exporting Results</H4><P CLASS="t">When the Mailbox Statistics tool completes its analysis of each set of personal folders, it sends a message to the administrator's mailbox you set up for collecting the results. When you run the tool in administrator mode, you can save your results as many times as you want, using different file types.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>To export your results</H5><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    Run Mailbox Statistics in administrator mode. </P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    In the <B>Save As</B> dialog box, select a file type for your results. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Interpreting Results</H4><P CLASS="t">Remember that Mailbox Statistics works with available data. For example, if a few users empty the Deleted Items folder when quitting Microsoft Exchange, and others do not, you can see wide differences between the statistics calculated from the Deleted Items folder. Moreover, Forward and Reply may not be computed as expected with localized Microsoft Exchange clients because the logic looks for RE: and FW: characters.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The first time you review the results, use the following example to become familiar with the local source of each statistic.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec4"></A>Sample Mailbox Statistics Results</H5><P CLASS="t">The following two sections list captions that precede each statistic the Mailbox Statistics tool displays. The first illustrates statistics from a single set of personal folders. The second illustrates statistics from combined sets of personal folders collected in an administrator's mailbox.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the caption is self-explanatory, no note is included. If a note is included, it follows the caption and is enclosed in brackets. Notes either define terms or clarify logic.</P>

<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec5"></A>Questions and Answers</H4><P CLASS="t">The following are common questions and answers about the Mailbox Statistics tool:</P>
<P CLASS="t">Q:    Why haven't I received any results in the administrator's mailbox?</P>
<P CLASS="t">A:    Check the installation of the Mailbox Statistics tool, including these verifications:</P>
<UL><LI>The administrator's mailbox name is correct.</LI><LI>Instructions and StorStat.exe were received by the users.</LI><LI>At least one user successfully completed the survey.</LI><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server is transferring e-mail successfully.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Q:    Why didn't we receive all the results?</P>
<P CLASS="t">A:    Each user can decide whether to run Mailbox Statistics. Some time may lapse before all the results are sent, especially if you gave no deadline, or if some users are away from the office. If the number of results is low, verify that all users received the instructions and the Mailbox Statistics tool, and then send a reminder to run the survey.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Q:    Why can't Windows for Workgroups or Windows 3.1<I>x</I> users run the tool?</P>
<P CLASS="t">A:    Mailbox Statistics is a 32-bit tool. It can be used only with Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation operating systems.</P>
