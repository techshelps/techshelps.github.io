<H3 CLASS="h2">Creating an .Ini File for Batch Setup</H3><P CLASS="t">Before you can run batch mode Setup, you must create an .ini file containing default installation settings. In the .ini file, you can specify preferences, such as the installation directory, the organization name, and the components, that will be installed. Using an .ini file is equivalent to selecting options in dialog boxes during Setup; however, the .ini file provides additional options so you have more control over your installation.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can use any text editor to create an .ini file with any name. Several .ini file examples are included on the Microsoft Exchange Server compact disc in the Support\Samples\Setup directory. The following example shows the format of the .ini file.</P>
