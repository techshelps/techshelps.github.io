<H3 CLASS="h2">Public Folders</H3><P CLASS="t">When you establish a new site, public folder replication cannot occur until the directory has been replicated. If the directory replication interval is long, the information store may try to replicate public folders before the new site has been added to the directory. To ensure that public folders replicate successfully, you can wait for the directory to replicate the new site information or force directory replication to occur. You can do this by choosing <B>Update Now</B> in the <B>General</B> property page for the server directory.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>If you force directory replication to occur, choose a time when the server's performance is not critical and connection costs are low.</P></BODY></HTML>
