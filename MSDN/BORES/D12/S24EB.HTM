<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 8 Optimizing Performance</H1><P CLASS="t">There are several ways you can optimize the performance of Microsoft Exchange Server to get the most out of your system, including:</P>
<H2 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Optimizing your topology</H2><P CLASS="t">Carefully plan how your system is set up and make sure it has adequate network bandwidth to handle the traffic between clients and servers.</P>
<H2 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Optimizing your server</H2><P CLASS="t">Take advantage of the hardware and software resources on your Microsoft Exchange Server computer so you can provide the fastest, most reliable service to your users. Windows NT Performance Monitor and the Microsoft Exchange Server Performance Optimizer can help you understand how to optimize your server's performance.</P>
<H2 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Balancing users per server</H2><P CLASS="t">Determine the number of users your server can support so you can achieve the level of performance you need. You can estimate usage levels and measure the expected load on the server using Microsoft Exchange Server Load Simulator (Loadsim.exe).</P>
<P CLASS="t">For information about troubleshooting performance, see Chapter 9, "Troubleshooting." For more information about optimizing performance, see the <I>Microsoft Exchange Server Concepts and Planning Guide</I> and<I> </I>the Microsoft Exchange Server white paper <I>Performance: Concurrent Users Per Server</I> that is available from the Microsoft Exchange Server web site (www.microsoft.com/exchange).</P></BODY></HTML>
