<H2 CLASS="h1">Understanding X.400</H2><P CLASS="t">The X.400 recommendation defines the standards of an electronic messaging system and enables users to exchange messages regardless of the system.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The X.400 Recommendations were developed by an organization known as the Comité Consultatif International Télégraphique et Téléphonic (CCITT). The CCITT publishes recommendations every four years. Each publication is identified by a color:</P>
<UL><LI>1984 - Red Book</LI><LI>1988 - Blue Book</LI><LI>1992 - White Book</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">The Electronic Messaging Association (EMA), develops specifications for e-mail software development. It is comprised of private e-mail software-development companies. The EMA publishes standards that further define the X.400 Recommendations.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The X.400 Recommendations are based on the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The X.400 Recommendations specify the structure of a message handling system, message structure and components, and the method used to transfer messages. Microsoft Exchange Server complies with the 1984 and 1988 X.400 Recommendations.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The OSI reference model provides a layered architecture that standardizes the method computers use to exchange information through a communications network. The OSI model separates computer-to-computer communications into seven layers: application, presentation, session, transport, network, data link, and physical. The top three layers usually relate to the operating system and applications that run on it. The other layers determine the way networks interconnect.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Using the OSI model, an administrator can choose the physical network, the protocols and transports transmitted over the network, and the software and hardware used on each end of the connection. As long as each layer receives and transmits information correctly to the layers above and below, it doesn't matter what combination of hardware and software is used in each layer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">X.400 runs on the application layer of the OSI model. This allows application processes to access network services. X.400 represents services that support user applications, such as software for file transfers, database access, and e-mail. The following diagram illustrates the seven OSI layers and examples of some of the protocols and standards that are used in each layer.</P>
