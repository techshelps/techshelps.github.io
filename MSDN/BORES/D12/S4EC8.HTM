<H3 CLASS="h2">Changing Permissions on Shared Directories Created During Setup</H3><P CLASS="t">When Microsoft Exchange Server is installed, Setup creates several shared directories so other Microsoft Exchange Server computers can access the files in the directories. By default, Setup sets permissions on these directories that are sufficient for most organizations. However, you can change the permissions if you are concerned that the default permissions on these directories don't give the files enough protection against attacks by unauthorized users.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Caution</B></P>
<P>You should change permissions on these directories only if necessary because changes could damage your Microsoft Exchange Server system.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Setup creates the following shared directories:</P>

<P CLASS="t">To restrict access to the shared directories, remove the Everyone permission and give permissions to specific accounts using File Manager. Use the following guidelines for restricting access on shared directories.</P>
<UL><LI>Only administrators responsible for message tracking should have permissions for the Tracking.log directory because it may contain sensitive information about messages.</LI><LI>You can give other administrators permissions to the Add-ins, Address, Connect, and Res directories. Only administrators that need to administer the Microsoft Mail Connector should have permissions on Maildata. If you are using the Microsoft Mail External program for message transfer, also give the account for this program permissions for the Maildata directory.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Do not change permissions for the service account and local administrators because this can have unpredictable results.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
