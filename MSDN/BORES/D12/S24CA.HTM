<H2 CLASS="h1">Using Forms Designer with Public Folders</H2><P CLASS="t">You can use custom forms to create surveys, classified ads, or order forms that you want to manage by working with public folders. Use the Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer to create forms and applications, and then work in Microsoft Visual C++<FONT FACE="Symbol">â</FONT> to extend the functionality of these forms and applications. The Forms Designer even contains sample applications that you can adopt as-is or modify to suit your purposes.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For more information, see the <I>Microsoft Exchange Server Application Designer's Guide</I>. You can also visit the Application Farm Web site at:</P>

<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Considering All Storage Options</H3><P CLASS="t">When you store forms, there are two locations to choose from:</P>
<UL><LI>Public folders</LI><LI>Organization forms library</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Public folders allow many users to view and store information and are useful when you have many people adding information or posting forms.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The organization forms library is more restrictive than public folders because only an administrator can install the forms. However, this can be changed by allowing all users to have full ownership permissions for the organization forms library.</P></BODY></HTML>
