<H2 CLASS="h1">Developing a Public Folder Strategy</H2><P CLASS="t">To develop an effective public folder strategy, you first need to understand the public folder architecture. In addition, consider developing a public folder policy for your organization early in the planning process. Policy decisions determine the public folder hierarchy that everyone in the organization sees, who uses public folders, and for what purposes. These considerations influence where public folders are created and how much disk storage, CPU power, and memory you need to achieve adequate performance levels.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When you plan your public folder strategy, consider whether you want all your messages to be located in one public folder or in many public folders. This decision is important because it determines whether you need to replicate public folders to other servers.</P></BODY></HTML>
