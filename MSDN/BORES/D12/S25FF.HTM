<H3 CLASS="h2">Using Mailbox Statistics</H3><P CLASS="t">When you use Mailbox Statistics, you set up an administrator's mailbox for collecting results and send the tool to your users to run it against their sets of personal folders. When user's submit a number of results, you can run the tool in administrator mode and export results to a variety of output formats. Before you send the tool to your users, you can test it with a smaller subset of about 10 people to ensure the tool works as expected and to become familiar with the different kinds of results.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Note that mailbox Statistics can detect only Microsoft Exchange Server distribution lists (DLs). </P>
<P CLASS="t">If the <B>Save Items to Sent Mail</B> option is not selected in a user's Microsoft Exchange setup, then Mailbox Statistics cannot determine the number of messages sent per day. You can ask the test group to select this option for at least seven days before the study to collect enough information to use.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To use Mailbox Statistics:</P>
<UL><LI>Set up an administrator's mailbox that will be used to receive the data</LI><LI>Send a message with Storstat.exe attached to the users to be surveyed. Those users double-click an icon in the message to run it. </LI></UL><P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Storstat.exe is supported only for users on Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec0"></A>To set up the Administrator's mailbox</H4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    Using the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, create a mailbox with the display name StorStat. </P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    Set permissions on this mailbox according to your organization's procedures so that the Microsoft Exchange Server administrator's account has user permission on this mailbox.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Results appear as MAPI messages with the subject "UserName UserResults." You can use the Inbox Assistant to forward or copy results to another folder.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>To send mailbox statistics to users</H4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    From the Microsoft Exchange Client <B>Compose</B> menu, choose <B>New Message</B>.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    In the message body, type instructions for your users.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    From the <B>Insert</B> menu, choose <B>File</B>, and then attach StorStat.exe to the message.</P>
<P>It appears as an icon in the message. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Users can be concerned about using the tool if they believe it will alter, damage, copy, or intrude in any way on their sets of personal folders. For this reason, you can include information to reassure them that no information is read or copied, no damage is inflicted on their data, and no changes are made to their data when this tool is running.</P></BODY></HTML>
