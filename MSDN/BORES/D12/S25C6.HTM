<H2 CLASS="h1">IMC Sample Extension DLL</H2><P CLASS="t">The IMC Sample Extension DLL intercepts inbound messages from SMTP hosts and selectively reroutes those messages to other SMTP hosts before they are processed by the Internet Mail Connector. This enables the Internet Mail Connector to act as a smart host that can route messages between the Internet and other SMTP hosts.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For example, if your organization uses multiple SMTP hosts, this extension enables you to designate the Internet Mail Connector as the single point of contact to the Internet. Other SMTP hosts can be configured to forward all messages to the Internet Mail Connector, where the extension will route messages appropriately.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The sample DLL modifies envelope addresses. However, it doesn't modify any message headers or the message body.</P></BODY></HTML>
