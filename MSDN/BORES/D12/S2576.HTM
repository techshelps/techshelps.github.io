<H1 CLASS="title">Appendix D Setting Permissions</H1><P CLASS="t">Organizations that make information available to a diverse audience need to manage who can access that information. Some individuals and groups need more access to information and resources than others. You can control who can use Microsoft Exchange Server resources by granting and restricting access to directory objects, public folders, and mailbox folders. For example, you can set permissions for directory objects and public folders or delegate access to mailboxes so that users can send e-mail on behalf of other users. You can use these features to enhance the security in your organization or as a convenience to your users. </P></BODY></HTML>
