<H2 CLASS="h1">Setting Up Your Public Folders</H2><P CLASS="t">When setting up public folders, you need to understand what types of folders you can create, where the hierarchy and content for the public folders are stored, and how public folders are located when a user accesses them. Reviewing these concepts before you set up your public folders helps you create a more efficient public folders system.</P></BODY></HTML>
