<UL><LI>Event id 2168 occurs when starting the Internet Mail Connector.</LI><LI>The Microsoft Mail Connector stops delivering mail.</LI><LI>Messages delivered to a distribution list fail because the <I>recipient not recognized</I> message occurs.</LI></UL><H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Solutions</H4><P CLASS="t">These problems occur when the X.400 address is deleted on an object, such as a mailbox, connector, or distribution list. Try re-creating the address.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Microsoft Exchange Server MTA is a native X.400 MTA. Therefore, X.400 addresses exist for every object. In a native X.400 system, it is important to have the X.400 address available for each object at all times. The Microsoft Exchange Server MTA can route and deliver on the distinguished name (DN) but requires that an X.400 address exist if there are problems with the DN. Microsoft Exchange Server also uses the X.400 address information to make routing decisions to foreign systems. In this case, the X.400 address and the foreign address information is used to route the message within the Microsoft Exchange Server topology.</P>
