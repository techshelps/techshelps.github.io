<H2 CLASS="h1">Balancing the Number of Users Per Server</H2><P CLASS="t">Definitions of users and acceptable performance vary from organization to organization. For example, a person who sends and receives a lot of e-mail may need a faster system than a user who sends mail infrequently. To help you determine the level of performance that's acceptable for your organization's users, you can use the Microsoft Exchange Server Load Simulator (Loadsim.exe).</P>
<P CLASS="t">Load Simulator can help you determine how many users your Microsoft Exchange Server computer can support. It is designed to provide a realistic load on a Microsoft Exchange Server computer by simulating the behavior of users on one or more Microsoft Exchange Client computers. It can be used for performance analysis and benchmarking or as a server stress tool.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Load Simulator takes advantage of multithreading, multiprocessing, and shared memory features in Windows NT Server to create and manage up to several hundred simulated users on a single client computer. Load Simulator makes it possible to run large server load simulations with a relatively small amount of hardware. It also provides a user interface for defining test topologies and user behavior and controlling simulations.</P></BODY></HTML>
