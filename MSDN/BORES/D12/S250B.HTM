<H3 CLASS="h2">Creating Users</H3><P CLASS="t">After you've generated the directory import files, you can import their contents into the Microsoft Exchange Server directory database. When you import users, Load Simulator creates a Recipients container in the directory called LoadSim.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Before you can run a load simulation test, you must import the simulated users. You can import the users and, if selected, distribution lists using Load Simulator or the Administrator program. In most cases, Load Simulator is sufficient for performing this task.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec0"></A>To import users with Load Simulator</H4><UL><LI>After generating the directory import files, choose <B>Import Users</B> from the <B>Configuration</B> menu.</LI></UL><P>Load Simulator attempts directory import on a server in each of the sites defined in your topology.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can use the Administrator program instead of Load Simulator to import users and distribution lists.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>To import using the Administrator program</H4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    Copy the directory import file for the site (the .csv file named for the site) to a Microsoft Exchange Server computer running the Administrator program.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    Select the site you want to import users to.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    From the <B>Tools</B> menu, choose <B>Directory Import</B>.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.    Select the import file you just copied.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.    Make sure<B> </B>the <B>Create Windows NT account</B> option is cleared.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.    Choose <B>Import</B> to begin the directory import process.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>If you perform more than one directory import, you should delete the Load Simulator container from your site before performing additional directory imports. Otherwise, properties for users that have already been imported will be merged with those of the import file.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Changing Default Permissions on User Accounts</H4><P CLASS="t">Simulated users must be validated by a Windows NT domain when they connect to a Microsoft Exchange Server computer, just as if they were real users. Because Load Simulator simulates multiple users per Microsoft Exchange Client computer, you don't need a separate account for each user. Most load simulation tests require only a single account.</P>
<P CLASS="t">By default, Load Simulator grants mailbox owner permissions to every user account in the home server's domain. If the user account used by your Load Simulator client computers are in the same domain as your Microsoft Exchange Server computers, by default, all simulated clients can access the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the default permissions are not sufficient, you can add additional account permissions in the directory import files that Load Simulator generates.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Editing user account permissions in a directory import file</H5><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    After generating the directory import files, open the site import file (the .csv file named for the site) containing the user accounts for which you need to edit permissions.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    Edit the list of account permissions that are separated by percent signs (%) at the end of each user import description line. The default value is \Domain Users.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For example, Jane has one simulated client in the Jane1 domain and another client and server in the Jane2 domain. The domains trust each other. After generating directory import files using Load Simulator, Jane uses a text editor to edit the site's .csv file. She edits the list of account permissions for each user so that when she imports the user accounts, the permissions will be set up correctly:</P>
<P CLASS="t">Jane1\Domain Users%Jane2\Domain Users.</P></BODY></HTML>
