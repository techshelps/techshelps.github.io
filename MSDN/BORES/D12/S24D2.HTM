<H2 CLASS="h1">X.400 Addressing</H2><P CLASS="t">A <I>management domain</I> (MD) is a set of messaging systems managed by an organization that contains at least one message transfer agent. The management domain is divided into two parts: <I>administrative management domain</I> (ADMD) and <I>private management domain</I> (PRMD).</P>
<P CLASS="t">An ADMD is managed by a public service provider and is the highest level management domain that transmits third-party message traffic. The service is usually provided by a telephone carrier such as Sprint, AT&amp;T, or British Telecom.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A PRMD is a network owned by a private company. PRMDs can communicate with ADMDs and other PRMDs but are not permitted to relay messages between PRMDs.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The ADMD and PRMD structure is similar to the telephone system. An ADMD can be compared to a telephone carrier that you receive phone service from. The service is leased from the ADMD in the form of a PRMD. This is similar to how a telephone line is assigned. The PRMD has a unique network address that can have multiple users.</P></BODY></HTML>
