<H3 CLASS="h2">Adjust Server Load</H3><P CLASS="t">If any SMS servers are performing poorly, see if they are overloaded with other tasks. To do this, determine all other services running on the server, such as logon processing, application sharing, file and print, and so on. Check to see if any of these services can be moved to other servers. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If SMS servers are running SQL&nbsp;Server, serving as package source or package distribution servers, or running SMS sender components, consider moving these functions to other servers. Note that, by default, the site server is used as a distribution server; you can select the distribution servers to be used in a site in the Site Properties dialog box.</P></BODY></HTML>
