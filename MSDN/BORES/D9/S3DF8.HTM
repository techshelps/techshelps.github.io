<H3 CLASS="h2">Ensure Computers Have Adequate Capacity</H3><P CLASS="t">Capacity planning is the process of ensuring that a system has enough resources to perform optimally. Ideally, capacity planning should be done before you implement SMS, however it is often a good idea to review your planning assumptions after you have deployed SMS. To review the guidelines for capacity planning, see the SMS version 1.2 <I>Concepts and Planning</I>, Chapters 10 and 11.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Capacity planning guidelines generally focus on computer CPU, disk, memory, and networking capabilities. The following guidelines should be observed for SMS site servers:</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>A fast CPU is required.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The site server requires a fast Pentium, Alpha, or MIPS CPU. In certain cases, multiple CPUs are recommended.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>A large, fast, NTFS disk is required.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The site server should have a fast disk formatted as NTFS. Multiple drives or drive arrays are recommended. The disks should have at least 500 MB free; 1 GB free space is recommended. If possible, each major application (Windows&nbsp;NT Server, SMS, SQL&nbsp;Server) should have its own physical disk.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>At least 24 MB memory is required.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">A site server running only Windows&nbsp;NT Server and SMS should be configured with at least 24 MB. A site server running SQL&nbsp;Server in addition to Windows&nbsp;NT Server and SMS should be configured with at least 32 MB. Additional memory should be allocated to other major applications (such as Microsoft SNA&nbsp;Server or the Windows&nbsp;NT Server Services for Macintosh). In certain cases, up to double the required amount of memory is recommended.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>A fast network interface is required. </B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The site server must communicate with many other servers (some in its own site, some in remote sites). </P></BODY></HTML>
