<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>default servers machine group</H3><P CLASS="t">A special machine group used for processing jobs at target sites. The default servers machine group specifies the servers where package source directories are installed:</P>
<UL><LI>If Default Servers is selected as the target for distribution servers.</LI><LI>If a target site does not contain any of the servers specified by Put On New Distribution Servers.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">At each site, the SMS system creates the default servers machine group. By default, the default servers machine group contains only the site server.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Delta-MIF</H3><P CLASS="t">A binary file with information stored in the Management Information Format standard and used by the SMS services to add information to the site database.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Despooler</H3><P CLASS="t">An SMS component (within the SMS Executive) that watches for despooler instruction files and compressed packages created by the Scheduler (the instructions and packages can come from the local site or from another site). The Despooler reads the instruction file and uses the instructions to decompress and handle the package files. For example, it decompresses inventory files so they can be processed by the Inventory Data Loader, which then updates the database.</P>

<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec6"></A>domain</H3><P CLASS="t">For Windows&nbsp;NT and LAN&nbsp;Manager networks, a domain is an administrative unit based on a database of security and user account information shared by a set of servers. For servers running LAN&nbsp;Manager and Windows&nbsp;NT Server, a domain supplies centralized security and user account information for a group of servers. When a user at a client running LAN&nbsp;Manager or Windows&nbsp;NT logs on to a domain, that client participates in that domain while that user is logged on.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For NetWare networks, a domain is based on a group of NetWare servers on a LAN. The servers in a NetWare domain are specified when the domain is added to a site.</P></BODY></HTML>
