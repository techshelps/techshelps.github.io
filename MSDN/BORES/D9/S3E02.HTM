<H3 CLASS="h2">Prevent Resyncs</H3><P CLASS="t">Resyncs occur when inventory information reported to the database does not match information already in the database. The Inventory Data Loader creates a system job to send a resync request to the specified computer. The <B>resync </B>command is written to the master inventory command file (RESYNC.CFG) for the computer's SMS domain. This file is then replicated to all SMS logon servers in the SMS domain. When the computer reads the resync request, it generates a full inventory MIF file, which is sent to the database. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Use SMS Database Manager to prevent resyncs by periodically checking for duplicate computers in the database. Delete older duplicates, and fix any problems that may cause duplicate computers to appear. Do not delete all duplicates because this will cause even more resyncs.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Resyncs send system jobs <I>down</I> the hierarchy, while resync MIF files and events MIF files are sent <I>up</I> the hierarchy. This can overload SMS, especially in a large SMS hierarchy. In addition, the RESYNC.CFG file can grow quite large, which can slow down log ons. If you experience a lot of resyncs in a site, and the resync file grows larger than 50K, you can delete the resync file. The source for the RESYNC.CFG is:</P>
<P CLASS="t">SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\INVDOpSM.BOX\DOMAIN_X.000\RESYNC.CFG</P>
<P CLASS="t">The next time a resync occurs, SMS will create a new resync file.</P></BODY></HTML>
