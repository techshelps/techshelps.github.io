<H3 CLASS="h2">Client Setup Command Line Options</H3><P CLASS="t">You can run SMS Client Setup manually from the appropriate *.BIN subdirectory of the LOGON.SRV directory (SMS_SHR share) on an SMS logon server. You can run SMS Client Setup with one or more command line options. For example, you can initiate the removal of clients by modifying the SMSLS batch file to run SMS Client Setup with the <B>/r</B> option. Users can initiate removal of their client by connecting to the SMS_SHR on their SMS logon server and running SMS Client Setup manually with the <B>/r</B> option, or they can run DEINSTAL.BAT. The syntax for SMS Client Setup is as follows:</P>
<P CLASS="t">{<B>cli_dos</B> | <B>cli_nt</B> | <B>cli_os2</B>} [<B>/r</B> | <B>/u</B> | /<B>f</B> | <B>/p:</B><I>path</I> | <B>/d:</B><I>drive</I> | <B>/v </B>|<B> /k</B>]</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>/r</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Removes the SMS client components. With this option, SMS Client Setup must run twice because SMS applications must be stopped before files are removed. This overrides Client settings in the Site Properties dialog box.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>/u</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Upgrades SMS client components. With this option, SMS Client Setup must run twice because SMS applications must be stopped before files are updated.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>/f</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Verifies that each SMS client component file is correctly installed and that the client's system files are correctly configured for SMS. With this option, SMS Client Setup must run twice.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>/p:</B><I>path</I></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Specifies the path for the SMS\LOGON.SRV directory. For example, at a client running MS-DOS, from the command prompt, type:</P>
<P CLASS="dt1"><B>cli_dos /p:R:</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Where <B>R:</B> is the connection to the SMS_SHR on the SMS logon server.</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">You can also use a UNC path. For example:</P>
<P CLASS="dt1"><B>cli_dos /p:\\</B><I>SMS_server</I><B>\SMS_SHR</B></P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>/d:</B><I>drive</I></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Specifies the installation drive on the client. By default, SMS is installed on the drive with the largest amount of free space.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>/v</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Sets verbose mode. SMS Client Setup displays status messages on the client desktop as it completes its tasks.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>/k</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Specifies that SMS components are not running, and they can be overwritten if necessary.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If conflicting options are used (for example, <B>/r </B>and <B>/u</B>), SMS Client Setup selects the first option.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For information about how SMS Client Setup installs and upgrades SMS components on and removes SMS components from a client, see Chapter 3, "System Flow."</P></BODY></HTML>
