<H2 CLASS="h1">Common Causes for Job Problems</H2><P CLASS="t">SMS is designed so that a Run Command On Workstations job does not show a status of complete unless all possible target computers have run the package command.

It just means that not all target computers have run the command.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following sections describe some other common reasons why jobs might show a failed or incomplete status. </P></BODY></HTML>
