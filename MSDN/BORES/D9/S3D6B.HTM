<H2 CLASS="h1">Package Definition Files</H2><P CLASS="t">A package definition file (PDF) is a text file that contains predefined Workstations, Sharing, and Inventory property settings for a package. When you create a new package, you can use the Import command from the Package Properties dialog box to define the properties for the package, using a PDF.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A PDF follows the standard *.INI file format. It is an ASCII text file containing keys (the key names are enclosed within brackets). Key names can be separated by spaces. Each key contains one or more entries, where each entry follows the format: </P>
<P CLASS="t"><I>name</I> <B>=</B> <I>value1</I><B>, </B><I>value2</I><B>,</B> ...<B> </B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Values are separated by a comma and at least one space.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A PDF has specific keys and entries that are used by the system to set the properties of a package. The following keys are allowed in a PDF file:</P>
<UL><LI> [PDF] (required)</LI><LI> [Package Definition] (required)</LI><LI> [<I>SetupVariation</I> Setup]</LI><LI> [Setup Package for Sharing]</LI><LI> [Program Item Properties <I>Index</I>] (required for shared applications)</LI><LI> [Setup Package for Inventory]</LI><LI> [File <I>Index</I>] (required for inventory)</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">These keys are described in the following sections.

<P CLASS="dt1">To run a program file (that is, one with a .COM, .EXE, or .BAT extension), the user must have Read permission. The default is for both Users and Guests to have both Read and Write permissions. </P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Example:</P>

<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>SynchronousSystemExitRequired</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The meaning of this key depends upon the client platform on which the package command is running. </P>
<P CLASS="dt1">On Windows-based clients, this key is used to automate package commands that require a system restart (typically these package commands set up applications). When this key is set to TRUE, Package Command Manager allows the application launched by the package command to restart the computer. When set to FALSE, Package Command Manager will not permit the launched application to restart the computer. If this key is not specified, it defaults to FALSE. </P>
<P CLASS="dt1">On MS-DOS clients, this key is used to provide additional memory for the application launched by the package command. When this key is set to TRUE, Package Command Manager launches the application specified by the package command and then ends. This allows more memory for the package command, but it also means that Package Command Manager does not regain control after the package command application ends. When this key is set to FALSE (or not specified), Package Command Manager remains loaded in memory and regains control after the package command application ends. </P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Example:</P>
