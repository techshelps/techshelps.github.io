<H3 CLASS="h2">Optimize Site Properties Settings</H3><P CLASS="t">You should optimize the site properties settings for all SMS sites. Site performance is most affected by the service response interval, which is set in the Site Properties dialog box. Setting it to Very Fast causes services to poll more frequently, and increases the load on the SMS system. Setting the service response interval to Slow retards service polling, and causes a much lighter system load. You should set the service response interval so that it runs as often as needed, without overloading the system. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Other site properties settings that can affect system performance are:</P>
<UL><LI>Setting the inventory frequency too high (default is once every seven days).</LI><LI>Setting the Package Command Manager (PCM) polling interval too high (default is once every 60 minutes).</LI><LI>Running inventory on clients that use a slow network.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
