<H3 CLASS="h2">Remote Troubleshooting Across a RAS Connection</H3><P CLASS="t">If the site address for a client is a RAS address, SMS uses GATEWAY.DLL to make an automatic RAS connection and gain access to the client. GATEWAY.DLL initiates the RAS connection to the remote LAN and authenticates the user by communicating with a RAS server that exists on the same LAN as the client. When a remote troubleshooting utility terminates, GATEWAY.DLL disconnects the target LAN, closes the RAS session, and frees up the port and modem. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The SMS remote troubleshooting utilities only support NetBIOS transports and IP across RAS. IPX transports are not supported. Also, GATEWAY.DLL does not support the SNA Sender and, for SNA links, will return the message Can't connect via SNA to SIGHTNT.DLL.</P></BODY></HTML>
