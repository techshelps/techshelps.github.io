<H2 CLASS="h1">Tuning Tips</H2><P CLASS="t">Once you have determined that your SMS system has a bottleneck, you need to tune the computer so that the bottleneck does not impair system performance. You can do this by decreasing the load on the component, or by increasing the capacity on the component. For instance, if you find that the CPU is the bottleneck, you can reduce the number of applications running on the computer (thus reducing the load on the CPU), or you can add faster or multiple CPUs (thus increasing the processing capacity). </P>
<P CLASS="t">The following sections contain information about things you can do to prevent or fix bottlenecks once you have identified them.</P></BODY></HTML>
