<H3 CLASS="h2">Scheduler Problems</H3><P CLASS="t">The following are some common reasons why the Scheduler might not begin processing a job:</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>The Scheduler is sleeping.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The Scheduler runs on a polling interval. When you create a job, the Scheduler won't begin processing the job until its next polling cycle. The frequency of polling cycles is determined by the Service Response speed set in the Site Properties dialog box. Increasing the Service Response speed to a higher frequency might improve the Scheduler processing time. </P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>The Scheduler is busy.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The Scheduler may not get to a job immediately upon beginning its polling cycle. This is because the Scheduler performs many tasks, and some of the tasks (such as compressing packages) may take a great deal of time. Since the Scheduler is single-threaded, it cannot activate any jobs while performing these tasks. </P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>The scheduled job start time has not yet arrived. </B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">When the Scheduler runs, it compares the date and time specified by Start After with the current time on the computer running SQL&nbsp;Server (<I>not</I> on the site server). The Scheduler will not start the job until the time on the SQL&nbsp;Server matches the job Start After time. </P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>The Scheduler cannot access the SQL&nbsp;Server.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">When you create a job, the job details are stored in the SQL&nbsp;Server database. In order to activate a job, the Scheduler must be able to access the database. If the SQL&nbsp;Server is down, or the Scheduler cannot access the computer running the database, then the Scheduler will not start the job.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>The Scheduler is not running.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Under normal circumstances, the Scheduler should always be running on the site server (or on a helper server). The Scheduler is a component in the SMS Executive. You (or another administrator) can stop the SMS Executive, or even the Scheduler component itself (although this is not recommended). If you think that someone may have stopped the SMS Executive, use the SMS Service Manager to check that the SMS Executive is running. To verify that the Scheduler is running, look at the last entry in the Scheduler log file (SMS\LOGS\SCHED.LOG). The time stamp on the last entry should be fairly recent (minutes to hours old, depending on how fast the services are running and what the Scheduler is doing). If the Scheduler is not running, use the SMS Service Manager to start it.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following are some common reasons why the Scheduler might not complete processing a job:</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Scheduler cannot access the source directory.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">This error will occur if the Scheduler does not have permission to access the package source directory. The Scheduler uses the SMS Service Account to access the package.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Source directory does not exist or does not contain any files.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">This error will occur when the package source directory does not exist or does not contain any files. You must create the package source directory prior to creating the job, and the directory must contain at least one file.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Incorrect path specified.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">If you use drive letters when specifying the location of the package source, you must specify the path relative to the computer running the Scheduler. For instance, if you use a specification such as D:\EXCEL, this is interpreted as drive D of the computer that the Scheduler is running on, not drive D of the computer running the SMS&nbsp;Administrator. Also remember, if `you move Scheduler to a helper server, the path means drive D on the helper server.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Site server is out of disk space.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The Scheduler needs to make a compressed copy of the package to send. The compressed version of the package is always created on the root of the SMS installation drive. This cannot be changed. If the drive does not have enough disk space for the compressed package, the job will fail. You can verify that the package has been compressed by looking for it in the SMS\SITE.SRV\SENDER.BOX\TOSEND directory. The compressed package file name uses the package ID (not the job ID).</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Sender outbox closed.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">If you used the Site Properties dialog box to close a sender outbox, the Scheduler will not assign the job to a sender until the outbox is open. </P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Addresses aren't defined for the target site.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">If any of the target sites for a job do not have an address defined in SMS, the Scheduler will cause the job to fail.</P>
