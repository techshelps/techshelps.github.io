<H3 CLASS="h2">Loading the SNMP Traps' Functionality and Sizing Hardware</H3><P CLASS="t">Trapping for file activity is a good way to size the hardware for SNMP traps. Create several bursts of traps by changing the file permissions in large groups of files. By timing how long it takes to process the traps, you can calculate the trap throughput.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Caution</B></P>
<P>There is a large amount of file activity in all SMS directories on all SMS servers and clients. Trapping file activity in these locations will cause a flood of traps.</P>
<P>If the Automatically Configure Logon Scripts option is enabled, by default the Site Configuration Manager will check each user account for correct logon script configuration every 24 hours. This will produce two events for each user account in each SMS domain in the site.</P>
<P>Changing permissions on a group of files can cause bursts of traps. If the bursts are too large or too frequent, SNMP might stop responding. If so, stop and then start the SNMP service.</P>
<P>If you use the default of enabling the trap throttle, remember that if the throttle gets tripped, you have to manually reset it before any more traps are sent.</P></BODY></HTML>
