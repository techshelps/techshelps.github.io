<H2 CLASS="h2">I</H2><H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec0"></A>identification group</H3><P CLASS="t">A collection of attributes that uniquely identify a computer.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>installation</H3><P CLASS="t">Creation of a Run Command On Workstation job. A Run Command On Workstation job enables you to run a package command line at target clients. The command line can start an executable file, batch file, or Microsoft Test script to install the package or simply to run a command.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>installation script</H3><P CLASS="t">A file of script commands that a shell program (for example, Microsoft Test) uses to automate a setup program.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>instance (inventory/query)</H3><P CLASS="t">A single occurrence of a group in the inventory for an object.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Some groups (such as Disk Drives and Software Packages) can have multiple instances on a single client. For example, a client can have multiple instances of the group Software Packages — one for each package installed (such as a Microsoft Excel version&nbsp;4.0 package, a Microsoft Word version&nbsp;2.0 package, and so on).</P>
<P CLASS="t">Other groups logically or physically can have only a single instance (such as the Identification and Mouse).</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec4"></A>inventory</H3><P CLASS="t">The information that SMS collects for each computer on the network. The inventory includes hardware (CPU, BIOS, drive information, and so on), software (specified packages), and collected files.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec5"></A>Inventory Agent</H3><P CLASS="t">A component that scans a computer for hardware and software inventory and reports the inventory to the SMS system.</P>
<P CLASS="t">On clients, the Inventory Agent is a program that is run from SMS logon servers. When a user runs the SMSLS batch file, the Inventory Agent is executed from within the SMSLS batch file.</P>
<P CLASS="t">On computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server and LAN&nbsp;Manager, the Inventory Agent is a service (Inventory Agent for Windows&nbsp;NT and Inventory Agent for OS/2) that reports inventory every 24 hours. For NetWare servers, the Maintenance Manager performs inventory on NetWare logon servers.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec6"></A>Inventory Data Loader</H3><P CLASS="t">An SMS component (within the SMS Executive service) that monitors the SMS system for Delta-MIFs (which store information about computer inventory, job status, and events) used to update the database.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec7"></A>inventory frequency</H3><P CLASS="t">The interval at which the Inventory Agent scans a computer for inventory. Each site has settings for inventory frequency. A site's inventory frequency settings apply to all clients in the site.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The inventory frequency is the time between the last scan and the current time when the Inventory Agent is invoked, either from a logon script or explicitly from the command line. The Inventory Agent scans for two types of inventory: hardware and software. You can set the frequency independently for both hardware and software scanning.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec8"></A>Inventory Processor</H3><P CLASS="t">An SMS component (within the SMS Executive service) that collects all the RAW files created by the Inventory Agent and creates a history file for each computer (an image of the last RAW file). When new RAW files are ready, it compares them with the history files and writes changes to inventory files called Delta-MIFs. The Inventory Processor also converts MIF files in the ISVMIF directory into Delta-MIFs.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec9"></A>inventory rule</H3><P CLASS="t">The set of files used to identify the package. To detect each file, specify its attributes (such as file date, file size, CRC, and so on). The SMS inventory system uses this criteria to identify a software package on individual computers and to include it in the computer inventory.</P></BODY></HTML>
