<H2 CLASS="h1">Client Configuration Request Files</H2><P CLASS="t">The client configuration request (CCR) notifies the Client Configuration Manager that a particular Windows&nbsp;NT-based client needs to be configured. The CCR file is a small text file with an INI file format. The file is named <I>SMSID</I>.CCR, where <I>SMSID</I> is the 8 character SMS ID assigned to the client.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">New CCR files are created by SMS Client Setup for Windows&nbsp;NT (CLI_NT). CCR files are placed in the LOGON.SRV\CCR.BOX directory. CCR files that have failed at least one processing attempt by Client Configuration Manager are moved to the LOGON.SRV\CCR.BOX\RETRY directory.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The CCR file has two sections:</P>
<UL><LI> [NT Client Configuration Request]</LI><LI> [Request Processing]</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">Dates and times in the [NT Client Configuration Request] section are relative to the client. The [NT Client Configuration Request] section has the following keys:</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Machine Name</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The name of the target client. It is used by Client Configuration Manager to locate the computer.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Domain</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The name of the SMS domain that the client belongs to, as determined by CLI_NT. Client Configuration Manager uses this field to establish remote administrative access to the system. </P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Initial Request Date</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The date and time when CLI_NT created a new CCR.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Latest Request Date</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The date and time that CLI_NT last updated the CCR.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Client Request Count</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The number of times that CLI_NT requested configuration work since this CCR was created.</P>
<P CLASS="t"></P>
<P CLASS="t">Dates and times in the [Request Processing] section are relative to the server running Client Configuration Manager. The [Request Processing] section has the following keys:</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Initial Processing Attempt</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The date and time when Client Configuration Manager first attempted to process the request. It is used to determine when to report a delayed error event to the SMS database.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Retry Interval Start</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The date and time when Client Configuration Manager first attempted to process the request after a new CCR was received for this computer. It is used to determine when to stop retrying this request and report an event to the SMS database.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Latest Processing Attempt</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The date and time when Client Configuration Manager last attempted to process the request. </P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Number of Processing Attempts</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">A count incremented each time Client Configuration Manager unsuccessfully attempts to process the request. </P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Last Error Code</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">A numeric code indicating the error that prevented Client Configuration Manager from processing the request on the latest attempt.</P>
<P CLASS="t"></P>
<P CLASS="t">The keys Machine Name, Domain, Initial Request Date, Latest Request Date, and Client Request Count are written by CLI_NT when the request is created.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The keys Latest Request Date, Client Request Count, and Retry Interval Start are updated by Client Configuration Manager when it finds that a CCR already exists for the specified SMS ID. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The keys Initial Processing Attempt, Latest Processing Attempt, Number of Processing Attempts, and Last Error Code are updated each time Client Configuration Manager encounters an error while attempting to process the CCR.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A sample CCR file follows:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>[NT Client Configuration Request]
Machine Name=MACHINE01
