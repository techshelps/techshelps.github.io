<H3 CLASS="h2">Windows NT Client Monitor</H3><P CLASS="t">The Windows&nbsp;NT Client Monitor is made up of the CLI_NT.EXE and CLIMONNT.EXE programs. The Windows&nbsp;NT Client Monitor:</P>
<UL><LI>Copies RAW files from the client running Windows&nbsp;NT to the SMS logon server. Whenever CLI_NT.EXE runs, it copies the files that need to be copied, otherwise CLIMONNT.EXE copies the files.</LI><LI>Monitors changes to clients running Windows&nbsp;NT that require the client to be restarted. (This task is performed only by the CLIMONNT.EXE program.)</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">CLIMONNT.EXE is started by SMSRUN32.EXE when Windows&nbsp;NT is started and runs in the background as long as the user is logged on. When a directory change notification is received, CLIMONNT.EXE picks up RAW files as soon as they appear and copies them to the SMS logon server. CLIMONNT.EXE uses a polling interval to check whether the files on the SMS logon server (DOMAIN.INI, PKG_16.CFG, RESYNC.CFG) have changed and need to be copied.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>CLI_NT.EXE</H4><P CLASS="t">This program runs from the SMSLS.BAT or RUNSMS.BAT batch file when the user logs on. The CLI_NT.EXE program:</P>
<UL><LI>Copies DOMAIN.INI, PKG_16.CFG, and <I>smsid</I>.CFG from the SMS logon server to the client if the versions on the client are not current.</LI><LI>Checks to see whether a RAW file is present on the client; if so, it copies the file to the SMS logon server and deletes the copy on the client.</LI></UL><H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>CLIMONNT.EXE</H4><P CLASS="t">This program is started by SMSRUN32.EXE when a user logs on and runs the client continuously.
