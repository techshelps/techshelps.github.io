<H3 CLASS="h2">Objects and Instances</H3><P CLASS="t">Performance Monitor uses objects, counters, and instances to describe the components of a computer that can be monitored. <I>Objects</I> represent threads and processes, sections of shared memory, and physical devices in the computer. For instance, a computer has at least one object known as microprocessor. In some cases, computers have more than one <I>instance</I> of an object; for example, a computer may have multiple microprocessors. <I>Counters</I> are the things about an object that can be measured (or counted). When you specify what you want to monitor in Performance Monitor, you must always specify the object, counter, and instance that you want to monitor.</P>
<P><img src="srk_f01.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">Performance Monitor collects data on activity, demand, and space used by the objects in your computer. Some objects always appear in Performance Monitor; others appear only if the service or process is running. The following table shows the objects that always appear when you run Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0.</P>

<P CLASS="t">Each <I>instance</I> of an object represents a component of the system. When the computer being monitored has more than one component of the same object type, Performance Monitor displays multiple instances of the object in the Instance box of the Add to Chart (View, Log, or Report) dialog box. It also displays the <B>_Total</B> instance, which represents a sum of the values for all instances of the object. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For example, if a computer has multiple physical disks, there will be multiple instances of the Physical Disk object in the Add to Chart dialog box. This dialog box shows two instances of physical disks and a <B>_Total</B> instance. You can monitor the same or a different set of counters for each instance of an object.</P>
<P><img src="srk_f02.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">All counters for an object have the same instances. But, sometimes, the instances just don't make sense for a particular counter. For example, the totals of ordinal numbers, like _Total of Process: Process ID or Thread: Thread State, have no meaning. If you add them to you view, Performance Monitor displays the values as zeros.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Only 32-bit processes appear in the Instances box. Active 16-bit processes appear as threads running in a Windows&nbsp;NT Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM) process. However, you can run each 16-bit application in a separate NTVDM process to make monitoring easier. For more information, see the <I>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;NT Resource Kit</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Some objects are parts of other objects or are dependent upon other objects. The instances of these related objects are shown in the Instances box in the following format:</P>
<P CLASS="t"><I>Parent object</I> <B>= =&gt;</B> <I>Child object</I></P>
<P CLASS="t">The <I>child object</I> is part of or is dependent upon the <I>parent object</I>. This makes it easier to identify the object.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For example, each logical partition of a disk is shown as the child of a parent physical disk.</P>
<P><img src="srk_f03.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">In this example, two physical disks, 0 and 1, are each divided into two logical disks. The Instances box shows that logical disks C and G are partitions of physical disk 0, and logical disks D and E are partitions of physical disk 1.</P></BODY></HTML>
