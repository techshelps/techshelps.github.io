<H3 CLASS="h2">Sender Problems</H3><P CLASS="t">The following are some common reasons why a sender might not complete processing a job:</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Maximum number of sends already in progress.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">By default, no more than five jobs can be sent by a single sender, and no more than three jobs can be simultaneously sent to a single site. You can change these defaults using the SMS Sender Manager. For more information, see the SMS version 1.2 <I>Administrator's Guide.</I></P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>A higher priority job is activated.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">SMS gives priority to jobs with the highest priority specified in the Job Schedule dialog box. For instance, if there are three sends in progress to a site, and another higher priority job is activated, the Scheduler will suspend one of the lower priority jobs and start the higher priority job. The lower priority job will be resumed after the higher priority job completes.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Sender can't connect to target site server.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Network connectivity problems can prevent a sender from connecting to a remote server. An unreliable network connection can delay a job, or even cause it to fail.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Insufficient disk space on the target site server.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The sender must transfer the entire package and instruction files to the remote site server. The send will fail if the server does not have adequate disk space.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Sender account or password is invalid at target site.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The sender uses the account and password entered in the Address Properties dialog box. The account and password must be valid on the target site server. There can be multiple addresses for one site, so be sure to check the account name for all addresses in the site. To check an account and password, try to manually connect to the server using the following Windows&nbsp;NT command:</P>
<P CLASS="dt1"><B>net use \\</B>destserver<B>\ipc$ * /user:[</B>DomainName<B>\]</B>UserName</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">For instance, for the user BethS in domain Home1 to connect to a server named FarAway:</P>
<P CLASS="dt1"><B>net use \\FarAway\ipc$ * /user:Home1\BethS</B></P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Incomplete account specified in trusted domain environment.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">If your organization uses a Windows&nbsp;NT trusted domain model, be sure to specify the domain name when you specify the SMS service account and the site address account. For instance, instead of just specifying the account (for example, SENDACCT), specify the domain and account (for example, BIGDOMAIN\SENDACCT). This ensures that the sender will use the account from the correct domain, even if the same account name exists in other domains.</P></BODY></HTML>
