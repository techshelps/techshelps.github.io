<H3 CLASS="h2">Macintosh Components</H3><P CLASS="t">To start inventory collection for the first time, a user on a Macintosh client must manually connect to the Windows&nbsp;NT Services for Macintosh logon server to run the Installer program. After that, inventory collection is automatic at system startup.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To run Installer, the user selects the Chooser to connect to the SMS_SHR volume on the SMS logon server, to locate the MAC.BIN folder. When Installer is run from the MAC.BIN folder, the SMS files and INVMac program are copied to the client. Restarting the Macintosh then runs INVMac that generates client files, including SMS.INI and all local history files. INVMac also starts the Package Command Manager program (PCMMac) on the Macintosh. When a package is first run from the Package Command Manager, PCMMac generates the PCMHIST.REG file, which contains package status information.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following table lists SMS components on the Macintosh.</P>
