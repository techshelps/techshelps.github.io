<H2 CLASS="h1">SMS Logon Servers</H2><P CLASS="t">Every site has one or more SMS domains and each domain has at least one SMS logon server. From the site server, the following SMS components maintain SMS on every SMS logon server in an SMS-supported domain:</P>
<UL><LI>Site Configuration Manager</LI><LI>Maintenance Manager</LI><LI>Despooler</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">If you move an SMS component from the site server to another SMS logon server, you create an SMS helper server. This configuration reduces the load on site servers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Helper servers must be logon servers running Windows&nbsp;NT that are in one of the site's domains, and the HELPER.SRV directory must be on an NTFS partition. If the SMS domain containing a helper server is configured with the Use Specified Servers option in the Domains dialog box (under Site Properties), the helper server must be one of these servers. You can allow an unlimited number of helper servers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When you move a component to another server, files required to run the specific SMS components are placed in the server's HELPER.SRV\<I>platform</I>.BIN directory. The Site Configuration Manager creates the SMS_SHR<I>x</I> share on that drive and copies the required component files to the HELPER.SRV\<I>platform</I>.BIN directory.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SMS_SHR<I>x</I> also contains desktop services (the Package Command Manager and Inventory Agent), which are automatically installed on all SMS logon servers by the Site Configuration Manager.</P></BODY></HTML>
