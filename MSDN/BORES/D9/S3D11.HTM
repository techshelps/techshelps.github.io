<H2 CLASS="h1">Troubleshooting</H2><P CLASS="t">If you are having trouble installing or running the SMS client software, check the following:</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    Make sure the client has access to the network.</P>
<P>Use File Manager or command line options to establish a connection to the SMS logon server. If a connection doesn't occur, it can indicate a network problem or that a common protocol has not been established.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    Verify that the SMS.INI operating system to the network-type keys match the client's operating system and network type.</P>
<P>If they do not match, rerun RUNSMS.BAT, RUNSMS.CMD, or the logon script.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    Verify that the appropriate Windows network drivers are installed on clients running Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, or Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P>Examine the <B>network.drv =</B> entry in the Windows SYSTEM.INI file. One of the following entries should be present: LANMAN21.DRV, WFWNET.DRV, MSNET.DRV, or NETWARE.DRV. For Windows&nbsp;95, this value may be something like "Microsoft Windows Network (version 3.11)." If the appropriate driver is not loaded, Package Command Manager and Program Group Control will not start.</P>
<P>For clients running Windows&nbsp;95, look at the Network settings in the Control Panel to verify network support.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.    Verify that the client is running the latest patches of all software.</P>
<P>Microsoft Operating System patches are available on the Windows&nbsp;NT Server compact disc or from CompuServe. The Windows&nbsp;NT Server version 3.51 compact disc contains updated modules for the following client network operating systems:</P>
<UL><LI>Network Client version 3.0 for MS-DOS</LI><LI>Windows for Workgroups version 3.11</LI><LI>LAN&nbsp;Manager version 2.2c</LI><LI>TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11</LI><LI>Remoteboot Service for Windows&nbsp;NT Server version 3.51</LI><LI>Additional Network Interface Card (NIC) Drivers from the Windows Driver Library (WDL)</LI></UL><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.    On the client, ensure that SMS components have not been moved to the Startup group.</P>
<P>If SMS components are run from the Startup group, SMS upgrades fail. If this happens, you can install or reinstall SMS by removing the SMS component from Startup, restarting Windows, and rerunning SMSLS.BAT or RUNSMS.BAT.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.    Make sure the user logon account for the client has Read permissions for the SMS logon server's SMS_SHR.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.    View the CLI_<I>x</I>.LOG file for reported problems on the client.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.    For Run Command On Workstation packages:</P>
<UL><LI>Make sure that packages are designated for the appropriate operating systems. For example, if a package is targeted for clients running MS-DOS, it will not appear on clients running Windows version 3.1.</LI><LI>The date and time on the client must be consistent with the date and time on the SMS server. If these values are not the same, the package expiration time could possibly occur before the package arrives at the client.</LI><LI>Check the event log for failure explanations. Likely problems include insufficient disk space on a client or a network connection failure. In the latter case, try to make the network connection with the <B>net use </B>command.</LI></UL><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.    Check the <B>FilesNotDownloaded</B> entry in SMS.INI. Component problems can sometimes be caused by missing files.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.    For problems with SMS Client Setup:</P>
<UL><LI>Verify that the path is not too long and the Windows directory is at the beginning. </LI><LI>Ensure that WINVER.EXE exists in the Windows directory. </LI><LI>Temporarily disable virus protection software.</LI></UL><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.    For problems with inventory, restart the client and run inventory again. Then check the <B>FailedHardwareChecks</B> entry in SMS.INI.</P>
