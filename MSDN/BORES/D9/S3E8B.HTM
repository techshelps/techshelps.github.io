<H2 CLASS="h2">P</H2><H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec0"></A>package</H3><P CLASS="t">An SMS object that contains diverse information about software so that the software can be identified and installed.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A package is an object that defines software to the SMS system. When you create a package, you define the files that comprise the software, and the package's configuration and identification information. After you create a package, you can use the SMS system to install the package on clients, share the package so that it can be run from network servers, or maintain inventory on the package.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>package command</H3><P CLASS="t">A command line (within a package) that runs a program or runs an installation script that installs an application. A package can have multiple package commands defined. When you use a package in a Run Command On Workstation job, you choose the specific package command that you want to run at the job's target computers.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Package Command Manager</H3><P CLASS="t">An SMS program that runs package commands on SMS clients. The Package Command Manager lets users see the packages that are available and control the installation of optional packages. Mandatory packages are automatically installed by the Package Command Manager.</P>
<P CLASS="t">There is a different version of the Package Command Manager for each supported operating system. On SMS logon servers running Windows&nbsp;NT Server, the Package Command Manager is installed as a service.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>package definition file (PDF)</H3><P CLASS="t">An ASCII text file that contains pre-defined Workstations, Sharing, and Inventory property settings for a package. When you create a new package, you can use the Import command from the Package Properties dialog box to define the properties for the package, using a PDF. By importing a PDF, SMS uses the PDF's property definitions to enter the package properties for you. SMS includes PDFs for some of the more popular applications (such as Microsoft Excel).</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec4"></A>package distribution</H3><P CLASS="t">An action that is performed with a package. Distribution means placing a package on servers and making the package available from a shared directory.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For Run Command On Workstation jobs, distribution installs the package's Workstation source directory on the specified distribution servers at the target sites, shares the directories on the network, and makes them available to the Package Command Manager.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For Share Package On Server jobs, distribution installs the package's Sharing source directory on the specified servers, shares the directories on the network, and makes them available to users with the specified permissions. The package can be used as just a shared directory or as an SMS network application.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec5"></A>package source directory</H3><P CLASS="t">A shared directory that contains a package's source files. For each package, one source directory can be specified for Workstations properties and another source directory for Sharing properties.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec6"></A>parent site</H3><P CLASS="t">A primary site to which another site has been attached (that is, a primary site that has child sites beneath it in the site hierarchy). A parent site can have primary or secondary sites attached to it.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec7"></A>PDF</H3><P CLASS="t"><I>See</I> package definition file (PDF).</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec8"></A>pragma statement</H3><P CLASS="t">A line in a MIF file or event configuration file that indicates how the information relates to the information in a site database. <I>See also</I> MIF file.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec9"></A>primary site</H3><P CLASS="t">A site that has its own SQL&nbsp;Server database to store the system, package, inventory, and status information for the site itself and the sites beneath it in the site hierarchy. It also has administrative tools that enable you to directly manage the site and the sites beneath it in the site hierarchy.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A primary site must be installed from the Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 compact disc. When a primary site is initially installed, it is a standalone central site. Once a primary site is installed, you can use the SMS&nbsp;Administrator to integrate the new site (and any of its subsites) in the hierarchy of another SMS system.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec10"></A>program group (SMS program group)</H3><P CLASS="t">A collection of program items within the Program Manager. You create program groups using program items defined by the Sharing properties of packages. From the packages, you choose the program items to include in the program group. You then assign program groups to LAN&nbsp;Manager user groups, NetWare user groups, and Windows&nbsp;NT global groups. Wherever the users in these groups log on, their assigned program groups appear in the Program Manager on the local computer. By choosing a program item, these users start the SMS network application for that item.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec11"></A>Program Group Control</H3><P CLASS="t">A set of programs (APPCTL and APPSTART) on computers running Windows version&nbsp;3.1 and Windows&nbsp;NT that enable users to run SMS network applications. The Program Group Control feature sets up and starts the SMS network applications so that the applications can be run over the network from distribution servers.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec12"></A>program item (package)</H3><P CLASS="t">An object composed of an icon and the command line for running an SMS network application. A program item also contains other details about how the SMS network application should be started (such as running the application minimized). Program items are displayed to the user as icons contained within a program group that is assigned to a user group in which that user is a member. The user can use the program items to start SMS network applications. You define a package's program items in the package's Sharing properties.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec13"></A>promiscuous mode</H3><P CLASS="t">A state in which a network adapter card detects all the frames that pass over the network.</P></BODY></HTML>
