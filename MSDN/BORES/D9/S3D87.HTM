<H3 CLASS="h2">Using PDFs with SMS Jobs</H3><P CLASS="t">SMS uses jobs to distribute packages to target systems. There are three primary types of jobs for this purpose: Run Command on Workstation, Share Package on Server, and Remove Package From Server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">There are various job options that you can specify, depending on the type of job that you are creating. The main options that affect distribution software are the specification of targets, the distribution servers where the package will be made available, and the options for the Run Phase.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The most flexible mechanism for specifying job targets is an SMS database query. You can create a query that allows you to target only those clients or servers that meet the criteria for the particular package that you are going to install. Once you have defined and run the query, the resulting set of clients or servers can be specified as the target of the job.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Run Command On Workstation Jobs</H4><P CLASS="t">Run Command On Workstation jobs are the most common type of job used in SMS. This job is actually run on the target clients in the context of the package share that is associated with the job. It is used to install, remove, and maintain software on target clients.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following is a sample of a PDF that might be included in a Run Command On Workstation job:</P>

<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Share Package On Server Jobs</H4><P CLASS="t">The Share Package On Server job is used to install an SMS network application on a set of servers. Unlike the Run Command On Workstation job, the Share Package On Server job does not actually run a command on the distribution servers. It simply copies the files and directory structure in the package directory to the specified servers and makes them available as a share. The access permissions for each package can be set in the PDF for that package.</P>
