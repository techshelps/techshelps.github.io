<H3 CLASS="h2">Remove Package From Server Jobs</H3><P CLASS="t">When a Remove Package From Server job is created, the Despooler removes all files from all or some target site distribution servers, depending on which job task is specified (Remove From All Distribution Servers or Remove From Selected Distribution Servers). SMS uses the Package Location data in the database to determine which servers have a copy of the package. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This process is summarized in Figure 3.12, Remove Package From Server Job Flow.</P>

Note that this is the only way to remove commands from PCM instruction files (except by using the SMS&nbsp;Administrator to cancel each job that uses the package).</LI></UL><UL><LI>Leaves packages that have been installed on clients.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Leaves the package source directory at the originating site.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Leaves the compressed version of the package at the originating site. This is the compressed package created by the Scheduler in the SITE.SRV\SENDER.BOX\TOSEND directory on the originating site server. There are two ways to remove this compressed package: 1) Delete the package from the Packages window in the SMS&nbsp;Administrator. 2) Manually delete the compressed file (you can identify it by its file name: <I>packageid</I>.W* for a workstation package and <I>packageid</I>.S* for a server package).</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">For the Remove From Selected Distribution Servers option, the Despooler:</P>

After a Remove Package From Server job's Start After time elapses, SMS sends the job's instructions to designated sites. Using the job instructions, the Despooler removes the decompressed version of the package from the specified distribution servers. If you selected the Remove From All Distribution Servers option, the Despooler also removes the compressed version of the package from the site server's DESPOOLR.BOX\RECEIVE\STORE directory. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Note that if you limit package removal to sites A and B, and then specify a machine group containing a distribution server that is part of Site C, no files are removed from the server that is part of site C.</P></BODY></HTML>
