<H3 CLASS="h2">Deploying Microsoft Office&nbsp;for Windows 95 with SMS</H3><P CLASS="t">Before you deploy Office&nbsp;to SMS clients:</P>
<UL><LI>Review the Office feature set and decide which components to install on the clients.</LI></UL><P>You can take advantage of user profiles to require that a mandatory desktop configuration be loaded each time a user logs on. (For more information, see your Microsoft Office for Windows&nbsp;95 documentation.)</P>
<UL><LI>Decide on configuration and installation options, such as file locations, installation media, and installation method. (For more information, see the <I>Microsoft Office for Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>.)</LI><LI>Decide which existing files, macros, and custom programs you will need to use in the new software, and identify any extra steps that might be required to use the existing files and macros in Office.</LI><LI>Use SMS queries to identify which clients have the hardware required to run Office.</LI><LI>Run a test to identify any issues in deploying Office on your network.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">The <I>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;95 and Office for Windows&nbsp;95 Evaluation and Migration Planning Kit </I>(MPK) has several documents that can aid in your review of Office. For a copy of the MPK, contact Microsoft Customer Service.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The <I>Microsoft Office for Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>, from Microsoft Press, is a technical supplement to the Office product documentation, written to assist administrators in installing, supporting, and managing Office on corporate networks. The <I>Microsoft Office for Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I> is available at http://www.microsoft.com/technet/desk/office/orkf/orkftoc.htm.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Defining the Preferred Client Configuration</H4><P CLASS="t">Before specifying the preferred configuration for clients, you should:</P>
<UL><LI>Understand the current server and client configurations.</LI><LI>Select the features that will be used in the preferred configuration on clients.</LI><LI>Select the features that will be used to enable users to work together.</LI><LI>Decide where Office files will be located and how they will be installed. That is, will Office files be installed on the client's hard disk, or will they be installed on a server and accessed remotely by the client, or a will a combination of both be used?</LI></UL><H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Researching Current Configuration Variables</H5><P CLASS="t">To deploy Office successfully, you need to understand your current hardware and software configurations. Your deployment plan will be dictated by your current system environments.</P>
<UL><LI><B>Hardware configuration</B>

<UL><LI>For minimum hardware requirements, and to determine whether any clients need to be upgraded, see the <I>Microsoft Office for Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>.</LI></UL></LI></UL><P><B>Note </B> Microsoft Schedule+ requires a Windows-compatible network and a MAPI 1.0-enabled mail server for scheduling and group functionality.</P>
<UL><LI>Laptop and desktop users have different configurations, including disk space and access to the network. Installation options will need to be selected with the specific client in mind.</LI><LI><B>Network topology</B>

<UL><LI>You can install software on clients from a network server, or you can run Office applications as SMS network applications. You may need to have different configurations for each of these cases.</LI><LI>Installing or running Office remotely over the network may not be practical for clients connected over a slow-link network.</LI><LI>Use of different network operating systems can create issues such as server file sharing methods and client-server permission schemes.</LI><LI>Installing Office over the network and running Office applications over the network place different demands on network bandwidth, both in response time and in length of time connected.</LI><LI><B>Migrating existing configurations</B> </LI></UL></LI></UL><P>Determine whether you need to convert existing files, macros, and custom programs. For more information, see the <I>Microsoft Office for Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>.</P>
<UL><LI><B>Supporting multiple platforms</B> </LI></UL><P>In many large organizations, users are running Office on a variety of supported platforms. For more information about these issues, see the <I>Microsoft Office for Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Selecting Office Standard Features</H5><P CLASS="t">By reviewing the feature set of Office, you can determine how to configure clients for the needs of your users. Because you can choose which components of Office to install, you have a lot of flexibility in tailoring client installations to include the best set of features for your users, while reducing disk space usage.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Selecting Office Workgroup Features</H5><P CLASS="t">The workgroup features in Office establish how your users will communicate and work together.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Group scheduling with Schedule+</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The group calendaring functions of Schedule+ require an underlying mail client, Microsoft Exchange, which is part of Windows&nbsp;95. The small-business mail system that comes with Windows&nbsp;95 allows users to exchange mail and meeting requests through a single post office. Microsoft Exchange also can work with other mail systems as long as the mail system uses a valid MAPI 1.0 driver. Such systems include Microsoft Mail and Microsoft Exchange Server. For more information about Microsoft Exchange with Windows&nbsp;95, see the <I>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Using Word as your e-mail editor</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Microsoft Word for Windows&nbsp;95 can be used to replace the default text editor used in the Microsoft Exchange mail client, which gives the user access to all the Word editing and formatting features. To use this feature, Microsoft Exchange in Windows&nbsp;95 must be installed first on the client. Then, when Office is installed, choose the Custom Install; WordMail is one of the customization options for Word.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Workgroup templates</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Users can share template files for Office documents using the Workgroup Template setting in Office. This setting, maintained in each user's registry, specifies a folder in which Office document templates can be stored for users. By defining this to be a folder on a network server, users in a workgroup can have access to a common set of templates. You can use the Network Installation Wizard to define this setting for your users in a custom installation script rather than having them set it individually.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>MAPI and VIM</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The Office applications include commands to send and route documents using e-mail. These commands work with Simple MAPI and MAPI 1.0 or later systems, such as Microsoft Mail 3.<I>x</I> and the Microsoft Exchange mail client included with Windows&nbsp;95, and with 16­bit VIM-based mail systems such as cc:Mail and Lotus Notes.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Briefcase support</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Office supports the Windows&nbsp;95 Briefcase, which allows users to synchronize different versions of a file whether or not the files are on the same hard disk drive or on the network. Microsoft Access, specifically, provides individual database replication using Briefcase.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec4"></A>Determining Configuration and Installation Options</H5><P CLASS="t">When you understand the variables in your organization and how they will affect the manner in which you deploy Office, you can decide on the configuration for the preferred client. You will make decisions in the following areas:</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Location of Office files</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">When deciding where to place Office files, consider how the client will be used and evaluate the benefits of each placement option, including how each option will effect your ability to support these configurations in the future. Office can be local (files installed on the client's hard disk) or shared (files are located on a network server, and users share those files over the network). You can also put some files on the local hard disk and some files on the server.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Installation options</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">There are several basic installation options available in the Office Setup program when Office Setup is run interactively by the user. You can also create your own customized options if the Office Setup program is to be run in batch mode using a customized script.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Installation method</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Three methods can be used to perform the installation on the clients:</P>
<UL><LI>Interactive — allows the user to make all installation decisions.</LI><LI>Batch — provides a preset installation script for the user.</LI><LI>Push — initiates the installation for the user without user intervention.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t"></P>
<P CLASS="t">A complete discussion of all these options can be found in the <I>Microsoft Office for Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec5"></A>Creating the Administrative Installation Server Share</H4><P CLASS="t">To install Office over the network, you first create a network installation server share by performing an administrative setup of Office from the Office Installation compact disc or floppy disk set. By using the Network Installation Wizard, you can modify the files in this share to customize the client installations, including whether clients will run Office locally or over the network. For information about creating and customizing a network installation location, see the <I>Microsoft Office for Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec6"></A>Preparing the Clients</H4><P CLASS="t">Make sure that each client has enough hard disk space, RAM, and processing capability to run Office:</P>
<UL><LI>To use Microsoft Office Standard, you need 28 MB of hard disk space for a compact installation, 55 MB for a typical installation, and 89 MB for a custom installation (maximum).</LI><LI>To use Microsoft Office Professional, you need 40 MB of hard disk space for a compact installation, 87 MB for a typical installation, and 126 MB for a custom installation (maximum).</LI></UL><P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>Office requires 8 MB of memory to run two applications on Windows&nbsp;95. More memory is recommended to run three or more applications simultaneously on Windows&nbsp;95.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition, before installation run virus detection, disk scanning, and defragmentation programs on the client to prevent any later problems. Although the computer may appear to be operating properly, software upgrades often uncover hardware or software problems because of the way they read and write data to the hard disk. Checking the computer before installing Office will help you stay focused on issues related to the installation process.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Be sure to back up critical data and configuration files for the client, in case the installation fails or you need to revert to the old system for some reason. Also you should create a Microsoft Diagnostics report and copy it to a floppy disk by running MSD.EXE on the hard disk. If you need to automate the restoration, consider using a commercial backup program, instead of copying the files by hand.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Any or all of the following can be used with Office for; however, they are not required:</P>
<UL><LI>Windows-compatible network required for workgroup functionality and WordMail.</LI><LI>Microsoft Exchange client required for workgroup functionality and WordMail on Windows&nbsp;NT.</LI><LI>2400-baud or higher modem (9600-baud modem recommended).</LI><LI>Audio board with headphones or speaker.</LI></UL><H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec7"></A>Using SMS to Install&nbsp;Office</H4><P CLASS="t">Use SMS to distribute an Office installation package to clients and to run the package with or without user interaction.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can share Office in two ways:</P>
<UL><LI>Install all the main Office components (such as Word and Microsoft Excel) on the client's local hard disk but run the shared components (such as Spelling and ClipArt Gallery) from a network server.</LI><LI>Install Office using the Run From Network Server installation type and run all Office components from a network server.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">The technique for creating each of these sharing environments within the SMS system varies.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec8"></A>How SMS Distributes Office</H5><P CLASS="t">The following steps give an overview of how to use SMS to distribute Office when all Office components are run from a network server:</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    Create an administrative installation point for Office (run <B>setup /a</B> to a server location). See the following section for more information on the <B>setup /a</B> command.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    In the SMS&nbsp;Administrator, create a package using the Office PDF that references the administrative installation point. For more information, see "Creating the Office Package" later in this chapter.</P>
<P>SMS will pick up all the files in the MSOffice folder on the administrative installation point and copy them to one or more SMS distribution servers.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    Create a Run Command on Workstation job to distribute the package to selected clients.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.    When the package runs on the client, SMS runs, Office Setup from the copy of MSOffice residing on the distribution server. All the main and shared Office components are accessed from this server. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If Office is installed on a client's hard disk, the work of SMS is completed, and Office has been successfully installed. However, if you want users to share some or all of the Office components, there are more steps to complete.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec9"></A>Using Administrative Setup</H5><P CLASS="t">Use the administrative setup command to build a source directory. Use the following command to start this setup:</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>setup /a</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">This command copies the source files into a directory and creates a SETUP.STF file for use in network installations.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Important</B></P>
<P>Do not use the SETUP.STF file located on the installation disks for a network or customized installation.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec10"></A>To prepare the administrative installation point</H5><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    Choose the location for the administrative installation point.</P>
<P>Make sure that there is sufficient disk space. Office Standard needs about 90 MB for the administrative installation, and Office Professional needs about 130 MB. You need read, write, delete, and create permissions to use these folders while doing the administrative installation. </P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    Make sure that all folders are empty.</P>
<P>If a previous version of Office exists, move any custom templates you want to save, then delete all of the Office files.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    Create the MSAPPS32 directory for shared files.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.    Lock all folders to prevent network user access during the administrative installation.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.    Disable virus detection software to prevent erroneous virus detection triggers while <B>setup</B> is running.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.    Make sure the client on which you will be running SETUP.EXE is running Windows&nbsp;95 or Windows&nbsp;NT 3.51 or later.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec11"></A>Sharing MSApps Components</H5><P CLASS="t">When you create an administrative installation point, you define where the shared MSApps folder will be placed on the network; this location is written into the SETUP.STF file. When Office is installed to run shared components from this MSApps folder, the MSApps location defined in the SETUP.STF file is written into the user's registry.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SMS will distribute the Office installation package to the distribution server that is defined for a particular client, but it will not change the shared MSApps location defined in the .STF file. This means that even though a particular package may be sent to multiple distribution servers, all users of that package will share the same MSApps network location definition.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you want different groups of users to share different MSApps folders, you first need to place copies of the MSApps folder on the servers you want to use for this purpose. You can do this by performing multiple administrative installations, creating the MSApps folder on the different servers. Or, you can do one administrative installation and then copy the MSApps folder to the other servers. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Once you have the MSApps folder on different servers, you can give users access to the appropriate MSApps location in one of two ways: using drive letter mapping and creating one SMS package or using UNC paths and creating multiple packages. </P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec12"></A>Drive Letter Mapping with One Package</H5><P CLASS="t">By mapping the same drive letter in every user system to the appropriate MSApps server, you need only one SMS package for all users. </P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec13"></A>To use drive letter mapping to define multiple MSApps locations</H5><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    During administrative setup (<B>setup /a</B>) of Office, specify the location of MSApps to be a certain drive letter. For example, drive H.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    Copy the MSApps folder, with subfolders, to multiple servers, creating the same folder structure on each server.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    On each client, map the drive letter you specified in Step 1 to the server containing the MSApps folder appropriate for that client.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.    Create a single SMS package for Office using the administrative installation point you created.</P>
<P>For information about creating this package, see "Creating the Office Package" later in this chapter.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.    Distribute this package to all clients.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.    When Office is installed using the package, Office Setup will define the drive letter you specified to be the location of the MSApps folder, and that drive letter will be mapped to the server appropriate for each client.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec14"></A>UNC Paths with Multiple Packages</H5><P CLASS="t">If you are using UNC paths to specify the location of the MSApps folder, or if you are using drive letters but cannot define a single drive letter for all clients and all MSApps servers, then you need to create a different SMS package for each MSApps location.</P>
<P CLASS="t">One option is to perform multiple administrative installations and create a separate SMS package for each installation. During each administrative installation, specify a different network location for MSApps so that each package will install Office with a different MSApps location. You then distribute the appropriate package to those clients who need to use a particular MSApps location.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The other option is to perform one administrative installation and make multiple copies of the SETUP.STF file, one for each MSApps location. The location of the MSApps folder is defined in the SETUP.STF file when you do the administrative installation. By using the Network Installation Wizard, you can modify the MSApps definition in each SETUP.STF file to point to a different network location. You then create multiple SMS packages using the same MSOffice folder, but substituting the appropriate SETUP.STF file each time.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec15"></A>To use multiple STF files to define multiple MSApps locations</H5><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    Run administrative setup (<B>setup /a</B>) for Office.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    Copy the MSApps folder, and all subfolders, to multiple servers.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    Make copies of the SETUP.STF file (found in the MSOffice folder) — one copy for each MSApps location.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.    Run the Network Installation Wizard on each SETUP.STF file.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.    In the dialog box in which you define the location of the MSApps folder, specify for each SETUP.STF file a different MSApps location.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.    Copy one of these SETUP.STF files to the MSOffice folder.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.    Create an SMS package for Office using the MSOffice folder.</P>
<P>For more information, see "Creating the Office Package" later in this chapter.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.    Send this package to those users who will be using the MSApps location defined in the SETUP.STF file.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.    Repeat steps 6 to 8 for each SETUP.STF file.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec16"></A>Creating the Office Package</H4><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Office for Windows&nbsp;95 includes a sample PDF for use with SMS: OFF95STD.PDF in the Microsoft Office Standard product, or OFF95PRO.PDF in the Microsoft Office Professional product. The PDF has command definitions in it for the standard types of client setup: Typical, Compact, Custom, Complete (the same as Custom but with all options selected), and Workstation (called Run From Network Server in Setup). Each of these command definitions contains a setup command line that will cause Office Setup to run in batch mode with the specific installation type (except for Custom, for which Office Setup is run interactively). </P>
<P CLASS="t">For example, the command line for Typical is: </P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>CommandLine=setup.exe /q1 /b1</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">The <B>/q1</B> option directs Office Setup to run with no user interaction, and the <B>/b1</B> option directs Office Setup to use the first installation type (Typical). For an explanation of all the available Office Setup command line options, see the <I>Microsoft Office for Windows&nbsp;95 Resource Kit</I>. When this command is run from this SMS package, Office Setup automatically installs Office using the predefined options for the Typical installation type. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Using the Packages window in the SMS&nbsp;Administrator, you can create a new command in the Office package that will run your custom command line for Office Setup.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec17"></A>To add custom commands to the Office PDF</H5><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    In the SMS&nbsp;Administrator, open the Packages window, and from the File menu, choose New.</P>
<P>The Package Properties dialog box appears.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    Choose Import.</P>
<P>The File Browser dialog box appears.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    Select the appropriate PDF (OFF95STD.PDF or OFF95PRO.PDF). It is located in the administrative installation point in the folder containing the main Office application files.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.    Choose OK.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.    Choose Workstation if you want to install Office on the client's hard disk.</P>
<P>The Setup Package dialog box appears.</P>
<P>Specify the location of the administrative installation point for Office as the source folder.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.    To define the new command line, choose New.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.    In the Command Name box, type a name for the new command.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.    In the Command Line box, type the command to run your custom Office Setup.</P>
<P>For example, to run SETUP.EXE from the administrative installation point with the modified NEWSETUP.STF file, in quiet mode, type:</P>
<P><B>setup.exe&nbsp;/t&nbsp;newsetup.stf&nbsp;/qt</B></P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.    To indicate that no user input is required to run the package, select the Automated Command Line check box.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.    In the Supported Platforms box, select the appropriate platforms: Windows&nbsp;95, Windows&nbsp;NT, or both.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.    Choose OK, and then choose Close.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can now create a Run Command On Workstation job to distribute this package.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec18"></A>Testing the Installation</H4><P CLASS="t">After you have set up a client with Office, you will need to run a variety of tests to ensure that it runs correctly and that you can still perform all of your usual tasks. Use your own testing methodology or, from a computer on which Office has been installed, test the following to verify correct system operation:</P>
<UL><LI>Open, run, and close Office applications.</LI><LI>Use the major Office features, including opening, modifying, saving, and printing documents.</LI><LI>Open existing files in the new Office applications.</LI><LI>If the client is using shared components on the network, such as spell-checking, test these functions.</LI><LI>If the client is using a shared Windows&nbsp;95 installation, test standard Windows&nbsp;95 functions such as printing.</LI><LI>Shut down completely.</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition to ensuring that the preferred client configuration works as expected, you also may want to conduct additional testing of optional software features and components. This can help you determine whether you are running Office optimally. For this kind of testing, conduct side-by-side evaluations on two clients, changing individual features on each one, to determine the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Performance of responsiveness and throughput for local disk and network actions.</LI><LI>Ease of use for performing common tasks.</LI><LI>Stability of the two clients under stress.</LI><LI>Compatibility with applications and hardware.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
