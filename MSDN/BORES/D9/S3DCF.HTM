<H3 CLASS="h2">Testing the SNMP Client Setup</H3><P CLASS="t">When testing the translation of events to SNMP traps on clients running Windows&nbsp;NT, remember:</P>
<UL><LI>If the events are not being written to the Windows&nbsp;NT event log, they can't be translated.</LI><LI>If the traps are not going out on the network, the site can't receive them.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">To test whether security logging and auditing is working, add user permissions for a file or directory and see if security events show up in the Windows&nbsp;NT event log. Every time a file has its permissions changed, event IDs 560 and 562 should be created.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Next, test the trap sending on the client. In a directory that contains at least 50 files, set auditing for your user name. Add or remove a user from the permissions for the directory, subdirectories, and files. In the Performance Monitor, you should see CPU activity for SNMP. Private bytes for SNMP should slope up, then slope down, and then CPU activity should stop. This sequence means the Event to Trap Translator converted some events to traps, put them in the list, and sent them somewhere.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Network Monitor allows you to view whether events that have been translated into traps are sent to the destination.</P>
<P CLASS="t">At the site receiving the traps, SmsExec should grow in size and show an increase in CPU usage. The TRAPFLTR thread in SmsExec should show the increase in CPU usage. The TRAPFLTR log should show traps being written to the database, and the SNMP traps window should show new traps, after being refreshed.</P>
