<H3 CLASS="h2">Despooler Problems</H3><P CLASS="t">The following are some common reasons why the Despooler might not complete processing a job:</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Insufficient disk space on the site or helper server.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The Despooler uses a temporary directory to decompress the package. If the computer that the Despooler is running on does not have enough disk space, then the Despooler cannot complete the job.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Insufficient disk space on the distribution servers.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The Despooler will not be able to complete the job if any of the distribution servers do not have adequate disk space for the decompressed package.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Account or password is invalid on the target distribution servers.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The Despooler distributes the package to the distribution servers using the service account and password specified in the Account dialog box. This account must be valid on all distribution servers in order for the Despooler to complete the job.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Distribution servers do not support package properties.</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Distribution will fail if the servers do not support the type of package being distributed. For instance, if your source directory contains Macintosh files, your distribution server must have Windows&nbsp;NT Services for Macintosh installed. Likewise, distribution to a NetWare server will not succeed if the package files use long file names.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>If the Despooler successfully distributes the package to some servers (but fails on other servers), it will still create the workstation instruction files for the clients. However, it will only include the successful servers in the instruction files, so clients will only access the package from those servers. If distribution to additional servers succeeds later, those servers will be added to the instruction files.</P></BODY></HTML>
