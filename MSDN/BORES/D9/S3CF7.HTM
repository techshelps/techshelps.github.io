<H2 CLASS="h1">SMS Client Setup</H2><P CLASS="t">There are three versions of the SMS Client Setup program, which support the client operating systems, as shown in the following table.</P>

<P CLASS="t">Macintosh computers use the Installer program to set up and configure the client.</P>
<P>Caution</P>
<P>SMS Client Setup can fail on computers running the MS-DOS VSAFE utility. VSAFE, which is loaded into memory, is an MS-DOS utility that monitors a computer for viruses.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The SMS Client Setup program performs the following operations on clients running MS-DOS, Windows version&nbsp;3.1, Windows for Workgroups, OS/2, Windows&nbsp;95, and Windows&nbsp;NT:</P>
<UL><LI>Analyzes the client to determine whether setup, upgrade, or remove actions are necessary.</LI><LI>Sets up new clients, copies SMS files, modifies system files, and configures SMS applications to start automatically, if appropriate.</LI><LI>Updates SMS client files.</LI><LI>Removes specific SMS programs after an administrator deletes a client program. </LI><LI>Removes all SMS files, applications, and program groups.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>The client DOMAIN.INI file will normally reflect changes faster than the client SMS.INI file, which is only updated when logon scripts are run or the user runs the RUNSMS batch file.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SMS Client Setup uses the [SMS] section of DOMAIN.INI (located in the LOGON.SRV directory on all SMS logon servers) to determine what changes are required on the client. Client configuration changes are made in the Site Properties dialog box. By default, SMS installs and automatically starts all SMS client applications (Package Command Manager, Program Group Control, the remote troubleshooting utilities, and MIF Entry).</P>
<P CLASS="t">SMS Client Setup is called by the SMSLS or RUNSMS batch file (or the system logon script on NetWare clients). The SMSLS batch file runs SMS Client Setup using the <B>/p:</B> option, where <B>/p:</B> specifies a path to the SMS logon server directory (LOGON.SRV). It contains the copy-list file (CL_<I>x</I>.TXT, where <I>x</I> represents the client platform).</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>The SMSLS.BAT file has been split into two files. Rather than running as a logon script or running it from SMS_SHR, there are now two batch files that start SMS inventory and SMS Client Setup. Also, two new command (.CMD) files have been added to support OS/2 clients.</P>
<P>SMSLS.BAT is used to generate logon scripts and is located in the NETLOGON share. If you upgraded from SMS version 1.0, the old version of SMSLS.BAT is located in SMS_SHR so you can copy custom changes from an existing SMSLS.BAT file to the new SMSLS.BAT file in the NETLOGON share. Delete the old SMSLS.BAT file after the changes are copied. A new file, RUNSMS.BAT, runs manually from SMS_SHR.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To complete its actions on computers running Windows 3.1, Windows&nbsp;95, Windows for Workgroups, Windows&nbsp;NT, and OS/2, the SMS Client Setup program uses the SMSRUN (SMSRUN16.EXE and SMSRUN32.EXE) and SMSSVR (SMSSVR16.EXE and SMSSVR32.EXE) programs.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The SMSRUN program reads SMSRUN16.INI/SMSRUN32.INI on computers running Windows version&nbsp;3.1, Windows for Workgroups, Windows&nbsp;NT, or OS/2 to get the full path for SMS client files, and then it creates program groups on the client. SMSRUN also starts SMS components if the Automatically Start This Component options for the components are set in the Site Properties dialog box.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The SMSSVR program upgrades or removes SMS components from the client. SMSSVR then starts the SMS Client Setup program and upgrades or removes files as selected.</P></BODY></HTML>
