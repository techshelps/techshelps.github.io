<H1 CLASS="title">Chapter 4 - File Formats</H1><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) uses files to identify and configure clients, servers, domains, sites, packages, and so on. The files are maintained by various SMS components. Some files are in binary format, and thus cannot be viewed or edited. Other files are in text format; it is possible to view and even edit these files, although in general you should not modify SMS system files. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Text-based files that can be viewed and potentially modified are described in this chapter. For a complete listing of the files used by SMS servers, see Chapter 1, "Server Reference." For a complete listing of the files used by SMS clients, see Chapter 2, "Client Reference."</P>
