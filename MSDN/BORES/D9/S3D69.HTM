<H3 CLASS="h2">Using Parentheses to Group File Rules</H3><P CLASS="t">You can use parentheses to group files together as a single entity. Groups have higher precedence than the AND and OR operators. You can use parentheses to clarify how a package rule with a mix of AND and OR operators will be evaluated. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For example, consider the following package rule:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>PACKAGE 1 "Good MS-DOS and Windows Configuration"
  FILE "CONFIG.SYS"
  AND
  FILE "SYSTEM.INI"
  OR
  FILE "VER.DLL"</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">This rule contains no groups, and so SMS evaluates the AND clause (CONFIG.SYS AND SYSTEM.INI) and then the OR clause (OR VER.DLL). The package is detected if CONFIG.SYS and SYSTEM.INI are found in the same directory or if VER.DLL is found in any directory.</P>
<P CLASS="t">However, if you add parentheses to the rule as follows:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>PACKAGE 1 "Good MS-DOS and Windows Configuration"
  FILE "CONFIG.SYS"
  AND
  (
    FILE "SYSTEM.INI"
    OR
    FILE "VER.DLL"
  )</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">SMS evaluates the OR clause in parentheses before it evaluates the AND clause. The package is detected if CONFIG.SYS is found in a directory and either SYSTEM.INI or VER.DLL is found in that same directory. </P></BODY></HTML>
