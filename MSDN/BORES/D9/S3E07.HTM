<P CLASS="t">For each target site, Job Status displays an Overall Status, a Sending Status, a Working Status, and a Cancel Status. You can use the detailed status states to help troubleshoot jobs. Overall Status is described in "Overall Job Status" earlier in this chapter. The other three types of job status are described in the following sections.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Sending Status</H4><P CLASS="t">For each target site, the Sending Status indicates the status for sending the job's package and instructions to the target site. There are seven Sending Status states:</P>

<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Pending</B></B></P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Indicates that the send request for the job has been placed in a sender outbox; however, the sender has not started to send the job package and instructions to the target site. The sender may not have detected the send request for the job yet.

<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Retrying</B></B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Indicates that the sender has failed at an attempt to send the job to the target site; however, the sender is still attempting to send the job to the site. You can note the job ID and check the event log to determine why the job failed.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B><B>Complete</B></B></P>
