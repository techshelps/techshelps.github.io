<H3 CLASS="h2">Control User Group MIF File Collection</H3><P CLASS="t">If you have a large number of user groups, especially in trusted domains, make sure your site is not generating too many user group MIF files. If you detect a performance problem relating to user group MIF files, use the Set Global User<B> </B>Groups (SETGUG.EXE) tool to turn off or slow down the user group MIF file interval.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SMS collects all global user groups for all SMS domains in each site. User groups are reported at pre-set intervals, as well as each time the Site Configuration Manager starts, even if there are no status changes. User group MIF files include information for every user group that SMS finds in the site—in every SMS domain, and in all trusted domains. In a large SMS hierarchy, especially one with many trusted domains, each user group can be reported many times (once for each site that has access to it through a trust relationship). </P>
<P CLASS="t">User groups are mainly used with program groups, although they can be used with alerts and queries. In most cases, you can reduce the collection frequency. This reduces the load at all sites, and on every server that forwards MIF files.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you have many MIF files backing up in the DELTAMIF.COL directory, look at some of the bigger files. If they are bigger than 50K and are user group MIF files, you should probably reduce the frequency for user group MIF file collection.</P></BODY></HTML>
