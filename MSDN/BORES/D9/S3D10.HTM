If  SMS.INI is deleted, a new ID is assigned and SMS assumes this is a new computer. Then the SMS.INI file is updated with new information from DOMAIN.INI on the SMS logon server every time the user runs SMS Client Setup.</P>
<P CLASS="tt">When a user chooses the Help Desk Options icon in the SMS Client program group and makes changes to the default remote control settings, the EDITINI.EXE file writes these changes to the [SIGHT] section of SMS.INI. This occurs only on Windows-based clients that support remote control.</P>
<P CLASS="tt">When a user changes settings in the Package Command Manager Options dialog box, the Package Command Manager program writes these changes to the [Package Command Manager] section of SMS.INI.</P>
<P CLASS="tt">The Inventory Agent logs any hardware failures encountered during inventory, and it writes the date and time of the last hardware and software inventories.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">SYSTEM.INI</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">For clients running Windows&nbsp;95, SMS Client Setup modifies lines in the [386ENH] section as follows:</P>
<P>Device=\Windows\vuser.386 <BR>NetHeapSize=48</P>

<P>Device=\Windows\vuser.386 <BR>NetHeapSize=56</P>
<P CLASS="tt">VUSER.386 enables the remote troubleshooting utilities to run. Increasing <B>NetHeapSize</B> provides more memory for SMS remote troubleshooting utilities. It also adds device drivers (SMSROUTR.VXD and VSMSNET.VXD) for clients running Windows&nbsp;95.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">WIN.INI</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">For clients running Windows version&nbsp;3.1, Windows for Workgroups, or Windows&nbsp;95, SMS Client Setup for Windows modifies the <B>LOAD=</B> parameter in the [Windows] section to call SMSRUN16.EXE (<B>LOAD=C:\MS\SMS\BIN \SMSRUN16.EXE</B>).</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">AUTOEXEC.BAT</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">On clients running MS-DOS, Windows version&nbsp;3.1, Windows&nbsp;95, and Windows for Workgroups, SMS Client Setup modifies AUTOEXEC.BAT to call CLIENT.BAT if the remote troubleshooting utilities are installed or if Package Command Manager for MS-DOS is enabled. This modification is inserted before instructions to run Windows because SMS Client Setup looks for strings containing "Win" to determine where to insert the CLIENT.BAT file.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">CLIENT.BAT</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">SMS Client Setup modifies CLIENT.BAT to run the remote support TSR (<B>usertsr</B> or <B>useripx</B>) on clients running MS-DOS and Windows 3.1, and Package Command Manager for MS-DOS, if appropriate. SMS Client Setup also adds SMSWORK.EXE to all clients except those running Windows&nbsp;NT.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">SMSRUN<I>x</I>.INI</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">For clients running Windows 3.1, Windows&nbsp;95, and Windows for Workgroups (SMSRUN16.INI), and Windows&nbsp;NT (SMSRUN32.INI), SMS Client Setup modifies this file to define the SMS client program groups and to indicate which SMS applications to load and start automatically.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">PCMHIST.REG</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">This file is generated the first time Package Command Manager runs or archives a package.

Every time Inventory Agent runs, it creates <I>drive</I>:\SMSSAFE.TMP. Upon successful completion, it deletes the file. If the Inventory Agent does not complete inventory successfully, the file remains as a signal that something went wrong during the previous inventory collection.</P>
<P CLASS="tt">When it runs again, Inventory Agent writes entries to the empty SMSSAFE.TMP file. The status is recorded either as COMPLETED if a test was successful or CRASHED, if a hardware test failed. The next time Inventory Agent runs, it reads the file again. All tests marked CRASHED are skipped and their failed status is written to the [WorkstationStatus] section of SMS.INI.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">STARTUP.CMD</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">Runs the SMSOS2AG.EXE file on OS/2 clients.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">Registry database files</P></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><P CLASS="tt">On clients running 16-bit Windows, the REG.DAT registry file is modified by SMS Client Setup, SMSRUN16.EXE, and Program Group Control.</P>
