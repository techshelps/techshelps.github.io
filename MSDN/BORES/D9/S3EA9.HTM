<H2 CLASS="h2">S</H2><H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Scheduler</H3><P CLASS="t">An SMS component (within the SMS Executive service) that detects pending jobs and creates auxiliary files that allow jobs to be processed. This includes jobs initiated by a user, such as a Run Command On Workstations job, as well as system jobs.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>secondary site</H3><P CLASS="t">A site that has no SQL&nbsp;Server database to store its system, package, inventory, and status information. Instead, it forwards inventory and status information to its primary site for processing and storage. It also does not have administrative tools for direct administration of the site — you must administer a secondary site through one of its parent sites (a primary site above the secondary site).</P>
<P CLASS="t">You install a secondary site by using the SMS&nbsp;Administrator at the primary site under which the new secondary site will be placed. A secondary site can only be created and configured from an immediate primary site. A secondary site cannot have subsites beneath it.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>send</H3><P CLASS="t">An action that is performed by a job when handling a package. Sending is the method used by the SMS system to transfer data and instructions for jobs between sites (limited sending also occurs within a site). When a job is activated by the Scheduler, the Scheduler compresses the data or instructions needed to complete the job and writes a send request for a sender to transfer the data or instructions. The sender transfers the data or instructions to the target site, where the Despooler handles or routes the data or instructions to the SMS services required to complete the job at that site.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>send request file</H3><P CLASS="t">A file with instructions that the sender uses to connect to a specified site and to transfer the specified data to the site.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec4"></A>sender</H3><P CLASS="t">An SMS component (within the SMS Executive service) that is used by the SMS system to send instructions and data from one site to another (such as reporting inventory information or installing software on clients at another site). There are three types of senders: LAN Sender, RAS Sender, and SNA Sender. The RAS Sender and SNA Sender are divided into subtypes to support different means of communication.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SMS supplies three RAS Senders: MS_ASYNC_RAS_SENDER, MS_ISDN_RAS _SENDER, and MS_X25_RAS_SENDER. SMS supplies two SNA Senders: MS_BATCH_SNA _SENDER and MS_INTER_SNA_SENDER.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec5"></A>Share Package On Server job</H3><P CLASS="t">A job that places files on servers and shares them, enabling users access to the files at each target site. A Share Package On Server job installs the package's Sharing source directory on target servers and shares that directory using the specified share and permissions.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This job can be to simply distribute and share a directory at a set of servers in a site, giving users access to a copy of the source directory files. Or it can be used to install the package so that the applications it contains can be set up as SMS network applications, letting assigned users run the package's programs over the network.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec6"></A>site</H3><P CLASS="t">An SMS object that logically groups a set of domains into an administrative unit for managing computers. Every site has a site server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When you configure a site, you select the domains that you want to include in the site.</P>
<P CLASS="t">There are two types of sites: primary sites and secondary sites.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When you set up an SMS system for your organization, you must have a primary site that serves as the central site.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec7"></A>site code</H3><P CLASS="t">A three-character code that the SMS system uses to identify a site. Used as part of the addressing information for communicating between sites, the code for any site must be unique across the SMS system.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec8"></A>Site Configuration Manager</H3><P CLASS="t">An SMS service that installs and maintains the SMS services at the site server and the SMS logon servers in the site. The Site Configuration Manager monitors all the SMS services on the site server and all the SMS logon servers to ensure that those servers are active and the SMS services are started.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec9"></A>site control file</H3><P CLASS="t">An ASCII text file that contains the configuration for a site.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When a site is first created or the site properties are modified, the Hierarchy Manager creates a site control file with the proposed configuration for the site. The Site Configuration Manager reads this file to configure the site.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A site control file is also used by the Site Configuration Manager to report the current site configuration to the Hierarchy Manager, which uses the file to update the site configuration information stored in the site database.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec10"></A>site database</H3><P CLASS="t">A Microsoft SQL&nbsp;Server database that stores system information (configuration and status) and the software and hardware inventory at a primary site. Every primary site must have a site database.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec11"></A>site group</H3><P CLASS="t">An alias for a group of sites — that is, a shortcut for referring to multiple sites. Instead of referring to each site individually, you can include them in a site group and use the site group name. You can use a site group to limit a job to the sites in the site group. You can also use a site group to narrow down a query.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec12"></A>Site Reporter</H3><P CLASS="t">At child sites, an SMS component (within the SMS Executive service) that detects a queue of Delta-MIFs containing inventory, job status, or event information, and creates a mini-job to send these files on to the parent site. The Site Reporter exists in both primary and secondary sites.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec13"></A>site server</H3><P CLASS="t">A computer that contains the SMS components needed to monitor and manage the site, its domains, and its computers. Each site must have a site server.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec14"></A>SMS&nbsp;Administrator</H3><P CLASS="t">The program used to administer the SMS system.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec15"></A>SMS client</H3><P CLASS="t">A computer included in the SMS computer inventory. An SMS client is included in the computer inventory, receives packages for installation, and can run SMS network applications. In addition, the SMS system assigns the client an ID that is unique across the whole SMS system.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec16"></A>SMS logon server</H3><P CLASS="t">A server added to the computer inventory of a site. An SMS logon server supports SMS configuration, inventory collection, package installation, and SMS network applications for the SMS clients in its domain. A site server is automatically added as an SMS logon server.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec17"></A>SMS network application</H3><P CLASS="t">A computer program defined within a package and run over the network by individual users at clients. In the SMS system, SMS network applications are defined as program items within a package. You can assemble program items from any package into program groups. These program groups are then assigned to LAN&nbsp;Manager user groups, Windows&nbsp;NT Server global groups, or NetWare user groups. Wherever these users log on, they will see a program group that contains their assigned SMS network applications in the Program Manager on the local client.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec18"></A>SMS system database</H3><P CLASS="t"><I>See</I> site database.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec19"></A>SNA Receiver</H3><P CLASS="t">An SMS service that processes instructions and data sent by an SNA Sender. When you install an SNA Sender on a computer, the SNA Receiver is automatically installed with it.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec20"></A>SNA Sender</H3><P CLASS="t"><I>See</I> sender.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec21"></A>subclause (query)</H3><P CLASS="t">A set of expressions that can be logically treated as a single expression. You can explicitly specify that a subclause is a group. A group is surrounded by parentheses.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec22"></A>subsite</H3><P CLASS="t">A site beneath another site in the site hierarchy.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec23"></A>system database</H3><P CLASS="t"><I>See</I> site database.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec24"></A>system job</H3><P CLASS="t">A job that transfers system instructions to other sites. System jobs are used to maintain a site or report event, status, or inventory data to other sites.</P></BODY></HTML>
