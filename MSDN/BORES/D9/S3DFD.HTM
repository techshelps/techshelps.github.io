<H3 CLASS="h2">Plan and Monitor Jobs Efficiently</H3><P CLASS="t">You can use the flexibility built into SMS to schedule and manage jobs efficiently. Schedule jobs to occur during off-hours or on weekends. Use outbox scheduling to ensure data is not sent between sites during busy times. Do not force mandatory installations for large groups at peak times, or even at the same time. Do not recompress or resend packages that have been sent but were not modified.</P></BODY></HTML>
