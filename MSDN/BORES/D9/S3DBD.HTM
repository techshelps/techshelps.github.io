<H3 CLASS="h2">Setting a Server-Down Trigger</H3><P CLASS="t">This section explains how to set a server-down trigger. The trigger stops a capture on a computer running Network Monitor when another computer stops functioning. A third computer, running the Windows&nbsp;NT platform, runs a batch file that uses the <B>net view</B> command to query the network for the monitored server. If the server goes down, the computer running the Windows&nbsp;NT platform uses the <B>net send</B> command to notify the computer running Network Monitor, and the running capture is stopped.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Throughout this example, the computers will be referred to by the following names:</P>
<UL><LI>NM_HOST: The computer running Network Monitor.</LI><LI>NM_ASSIST: The computer running the Windows&nbsp;NT platform that notifies NM_HOST if the server goes down. Network Monitor on NM_HOST will be set up to stop capturing if it captures a frame that contains a particular data pattern. NM_ASSIST is set up to send NM_HOST a frame containing this pattern if a server goes down.</LI></UL><P>This computer does not have to be running the Windows&nbsp;NT platform, but it must be a computer on which the<B> net send</B> command is available. This command is available for Windows version&nbsp;3.<I>x</I> running LAN&nbsp;Manager version 2.<I>x</I>. This command is not available for Windows for Workgroups version&nbsp;3.<I>x</I>.</P>
<UL><LI>SOME_SERVER: The server being monitored. This computer can be running either Windows or the Windows&nbsp;NT platform.</LI></UL><P CLASS="t">The following figure illustrates the relationship among these three computers.</P>
<P><img src="srk_e13.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">This example is designed so that you can work through it simply by substituting the computer names on your network for the computer names used in the example.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Implementing a Server-Down Trigger</H4><P CLASS="t">To set the server-down trigger illustrated in this example, perform the following procedures:</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    On NM_HOST, set a capture filter that captures frames sent from any computer to the computer running Network Monitor, and then start a capture.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    On NM_ASSIST, use the <B>net send</B> command to send a text string (<B>serverdown </B>in this example) to NM_HOST.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    Use Network Monitor to capture and display the frame that contains the <B>serverdown </B>test string. Use this frame to determine the offset at which <B>serverdown </B>appears in the frame. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>The first three steps are intended simply to provide NM_HOST with a test frame. This frame's attributes are used later to provide necessary trigger specifications, and step 5 ensures that if SOME_SERVER stops functioning, a frame identical to the test frame is sent to NM_HOST.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.    On NM_HOST, set the capture trigger, set the same filter you used in step 1, and then start a capture.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.    Run a batch file on NM_ASSIST that uses the <B>net send</B> command to send the <B>serverdown </B>string to NM_HOST if the server goes down.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following sections explain how to perform each of these steps.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Step 1: Filtering and Capturing</H5><P CLASS="t">The server-down trigger requires two pieces of information: a pattern and an offset. A pattern is a particular arrangement of hexadecimal or ASCII data within a captured frame. The offset designates how many bytes into a frame the pattern occurs; this number is always hexadecimal.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The pattern in this example is arbitrary; when the trigger is set, the computer running Network Monitor stops capturing if it detects the text string <B>serverdown </B>within a frame. The text string, <B>serverdown</B>, represents the trigger's data pattern.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The offset is not arbitrary; because it measures how far into the frame the pattern appears, it can possibly distinguish between two frames containing an identical text string.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To determine the pattern offset, set up a Network Monitor filter to capture a frame containing the specified pattern.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>To filter for the serverdown pattern</H5><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    From the Network Monitor Capture menu, choose Filter.</P>
<P>The Capture Filter dialog box appears.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    Select the Address Pairs line.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    Under Add, choose Address.</P>
<P>The Address Expression dialog box appears.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.    In the Station 1 box, select the local computer name.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.    In the Direction box, select &lt;--&gt;.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.    In the Station 2 box, select ANY.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.    Select Include.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.    Choose OK in all open dialog boxes.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.    In the Capture window, from the Capture menu, choose Start.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Step 2: Sending a Test String</H5><P CLASS="t">When a capture has been started on the computer running Network Monitor, a test frame must be sent to this computer. This frame, when captured, provides the pattern offset that is necessary for the server-down trigger to function correctly. </P>
<P CLASS="t">To provide the running capture with a test frame, on NM_ASSIST, use the <B>net&nbsp;send</B> command to send <B>serverdown </B>to NM_HOST. The <B>net send</B> command takes two parameters — the name of a computer and an ASCII text string — and has the following syntax:</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>net send</B> <I>computername string</I></P>
<P CLASS="t">In this example, <I>string</I> is <B>serverdown</B>. Remember that on NM_HOST, a filter has been set that captures all frames sent to that computer. This filter will capture the frame that contains <B>serverdown</B>, and you will use this frame to determine the offset of <B>serverdown</B>. In later steps, you'll need this offset to set up the trigger.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec4"></A>Step 3: Capturing and Displaying the Test String</H5><P CLASS="t">In this step, identify the offset of <B>serverdown</B> — that is, how many bytes into the frame the first character in <B>serverdown </B>appears. This is the offset that you provide later when you set the server-down trigger.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec5"></A>To determine the offset of the serverdown test string</H5><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    In the Network Monitor Capture window, from the Capture menu, choose Stop and View to display the Frame Viewer window.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    In the Detail pane of the Frame Viewer window, expand the displayed protocol headers until the string SERVERDOWN appears in the lower-right corner of the Hex pane.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Tip</B></P>
<P>In the Detail pane, you need to expand only levels containing the SMB protocol header. If a plus sign (+) appears to the left of a level, the level can be expanded.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    In the Hex pane, click the S in SERVERDOWN.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The pattern offset appears in parentheses in the status panel of the Frame Viewer window to the right of the word Offset. This is the hexadecimal number you use when you set the trigger.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec6"></A>Step 4: Setting the Capture Trigger</H5><P CLASS="t">Once you have determined the offset of the test string, you can actually set the trigger and begin capturing.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec7"></A>To set the server-down trigger</H5><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.    In the Network Monitor Capture window, from the Capture menu, choose Trigger.</P>
<P>The Capture Trigger dialog box appears.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.    Under Trigger On, select Pattern Match.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.    In the Pattern box:</P>
<UL><LI>Select From Start of Frame.</LI><LI>Select ASCII.</LI><LI>In the Offset (In Hex) box, type the offset that you obtained in the preceding section.</LI><LI>In the Pattern box, type <B>serverdown</B>.</LI></UL><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.    In the Trigger Action box, select Stop Capture.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.    Choose OK.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.    From the Capture menu, choose Start.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec8"></A>Step 5: Running the Batch File</H5><P CLASS="t">Network Monitor monitors the server with the help of a computer running the Windows&nbsp;NT platform and a batch file. This computer running the Windows&nbsp;NT platform is the one that you used in "Step 2: Sending a Test String" to send the <B>serverdown </B>text string to the computer running Network Monitor.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following is an example of a batch file that you might use:</P>
<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P>
<PRE>:TOP
NET VIEW \\SOME_SERVER
If errorlevel 1 GOTO FAIL
GOTO TOP
:FAIL
NET SEND NM_HOST serverdown</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">This batch file contains a simple loop and two labels: TOP and FAIL. When the file begins processing, it runs the<B> net view</B> command, specifying the server name as a parameter, then processes the IF statement. If the <B>net view</B> command locates the server, the batch file returns to the TOP label and runs the <B>net view</B> command again. This process repeats until the <B>net view</B> command returns ERROR LEVEL&nbsp;1, which indicates that <B>net view</B> was unable to locate the server and that the server is probably no longer functioning. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If the<B> net view</B> command returns ERROR LEVEL&nbsp;1, the batch file runs the <B>net&nbsp;send</B> command, with <B>serverdown</B> as a string parameter, on the computer running Network Monitor. Network Monitor captures the frame containing <B>serverdown </B>as the offset specified in the trigger, and the trigger action is implemented; a message appears to indicate that the capture has stopped.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B></P>
<P>This example uses one batch file to monitor one server. Because you can run multiple MS­DOS sessions under Windows&nbsp;NT, you can run the batch file in multiple sessions, monitoring multiple servers. You need only to specify a different test string for each server, as well as the appropriate computer name for each instance in which the <B>net view</B> command appears.</P></BODY></HTML>
