<H3 CLASS="h2">How Custom Inventory Files Are Processed</H3><P CLASS="t">SMS enables users to customize the SMS inventory by creating MIF files. MIF files are ASCII text files that contain information about a computer component, such as a hard drive or network card. You add the inventory information in a MIF file to the SMS inventory by placing it in one of the special directories dedicated for custom MIF files. SMS components periodically scan these directories and process the MIF files contained in them.</P>
<P CLASS="t">There are two types of MIF files for reporting customized client and server inventory: IDMIFs and NOIDMIFs.</P>
<P CLASS="t">IDMIFs are used for adding custom architectures and objects to the inventory. They contain Identification and Architecture groups.</P>
<P CLASS="t">NOIDMIFs are generally used for adding new groups to the inventory of a computer already existing in the database. These contain no Identification or Architecture groups.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For extensive information on customizing your inventory using MIF files, see the <I>Microsoft BackOffice Software Development Kit.</I></P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Collecting IDMIFs</H4><P CLASS="t">After you create an IDMIF, there are two locations that you can place the MIF file in order to add its inventory information to the SMS inventory:</P>
<UL><LI>Place the IDMIF MIF file in the LOGON.SRV\ISVMIF.BOX directory on an SMS logon server.</LI></UL><UL><LI>Place the IDMIF MIF file in the IDMIFs directory on an SMS client. The IDMIFs directory is specified by the <B>StandaloneISVMIFPath</B> entry in the [SMS] section of SMS.INI. Usually, this directory is MS\SMS\IDMIFS.</LI></UL><P>If the Inventory Agent detects an IDMIF in the MS\SMS\IDMIFS directory on a computer running Windows&nbsp;NT or MS-DOS, it appends the *.MIF file to the *.RAW file it created as part of regular inventory collection. The Inventory Processor then extracts the *.MIF information from the *.RAW file and uses it to create Binary MIF files in the SITE.SRV\DATALOAD.BOX \DELTAMIF.COL directory.</P>
<P>If the Inventory Agent detects an IDMIF on an OS/2 or Macintosh client (IDMIFs will be in the MS\SMS\IDMIFS on an OS/2 client, and in an SMS\IDMIF directory created by the user on a Macintosh client), it moves the file to the ISVMIF directory on the appropriate SMS logon server. The Maintenance Manager moves client (and server) *.MIF files found in this directory to the SITE.SRV\ISVMIF.BOX directory on the site server where they are processed by the Inventory Processor and written to the SITE.SRV \DATALOAD.BOX\DELTAMIF.COL directory as Binary MIF files. (Note that the Inventory Agent programs for OS/2 and Macintosh computers write *.MIF files to the LOGON.SRV\ISVMIF.BOX directory as part of the standard inventory process.)</P>
<P CLASS="t">For more detailed information about how inventory is processed at a primary site, see "Collecting Inventory at a Primary Site" earlier in this chapter. For more detailed information about how inventory is processed at a secondary site, see "Collecting Inventory at a Secondary Site" earlier in this chapter.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Collecting NOIDMIFs</H4><P CLASS="t">After you create a NOIDMIF, you place the MIF file on an SMS client in order to add its inventory information to the SMS inventory.</P>
<P CLASS="t">NOIDMIFs are placed in the MS\SMS\NOIDMIFS directory on SMS clients. For example, when a user at a client enters a form by using the MIF Entry tool, a *.MIF file is put in the directory that is specified by the <B>MachineISVMIFPath</B> entry in the client's SMS.INI file. By default, <B>MachineISVMIFPath </B>is the MS\SMS\NOIDMIFS directory. The next time the Inventory Agent scans for software on client's running Windows&nbsp;NT, Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, Windows&nbsp;95, or MS-DOS, it appends the information to the inventory *.RAW file. If the client is an OS/2 or Macintosh client, the Inventory Agent copies the MIF file to the client's SMS logon server (in LOGON.SRV\ISVMIF.BOX). The groups defined by the MIF files are then added to the database.</P>
<P CLASS="t">NOIDMIFs can exist only on clients, except in one case: a user can place a NOIDMIF with a *.NIM extension in the ISVMIF.BOX directory on a NetWare logon server in order to extend inventory for that server. The Maintenance Manager processes the file, which includes appending the NetWare server's architecture and identification group to it, and writes it to the DELTAMIF.COL directory as a Binary MIF file.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Inventory Processor creates inventory history files for IDMIFs and NOIDMIFs and places them in the SITE.SRV\INVENTRY.BOX\HISTORY directory. Note that history is not created if a user copies an IDMIF with an *.NHM extension to the LOGON.SRV\ISVMIF.BOX directory. Additionally, *.NIM files do not have history. </P>
