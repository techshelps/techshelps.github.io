<H3 CLASS="h2">Optimize File Collection and Software Inventory</H3><P CLASS="t">For file collection, SMS collects all versions of a file. For instance, if you enable file collection and specify CONFIG.SYS, SMS collects every copy of CONFIG.SYS on each client.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Because SMS does not delete collected files, you must do this manually with the SMS Database Manager. For more information, see "Remove Unused Files from the Site Server" later in this chapter.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you enable software inventory, avoid creating too many software inventory rules. Monitor the time SMS inventory takes to run on typical clients in your sites. If too much time is devoted to software inventory, you can:</P>
<UL><LI>Remove the package rules.</LI><LI>Disable software inventory.</LI><LI>Use Software Audit instead of software inventory. Audits are run as Package Command Manager jobs, and can be scheduled to run at a specified time. Software Audit can also be used to target specific computers.</LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
