<H2 CLASS="h2">Troubleshooting the Remote Viewing Session</H2><P CLASS="t">Once the client has been located and permission granted, the remote viewing session begins. A variety of options and settings are available, and are documented in the "Remote Troubleshooting" chapter in the SMS <I>Administrator's Guide</I>. Unless you understand the consequences of altering these settings, they should be left at the defaults.</P>
<P CLASS="t">One issue that arises is the speed you can expect in remote viewing. Currently, only SMS includes encryption, so only SMS remote viewing is secure. Some people have stated that certain third-party products are faster than SMS remote viewing; this is an effect of the encryption phase. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For faster remote viewing in SMS, lower the resolution on the client computer and force16-color viewing. This decreases the amount of information that goes across the network.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Remote viewing is fastest over NetBEUI, and NetBIOS over TCP/IP is generally a bit faster than TCP/IP sockets.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For a successful remote viewing session:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">The server must be able to use the display information sent from the client.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The client must be able to use the keystroke information sent from the server.</LI></UL></SPAN><H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Troubleshooting Display Problems</H3><P CLASS="t">Once the client computer's Remote Control Agent has been located and permissions have been granted, the Remote Control Agent hooks into the video driver graphic functions, encrypts them, and sends the information to the SMS Admin workstation. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For the display to appear properly, the SMS Admin workstation video driver and card must be able to interpret and display the information they receive, including all drawing functions, colors, and font information. The wide variety of display drivers and video cards available complicates this process. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Further, graphical information requires a great deal of memory. The higher the resolution, and the greater the detail in the display, the more memory required to store the information. When this information is sent over a network in "real time" to display on another computer, a considerable amount of bandwidth is used. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Common display problems include display incompleteness or color-mapping problems and font problems.</P>

Or, increase the resolution on the computer running SMS Admin.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Try using the generic video drivers included with Windows.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Try swapping the client video card for one that works in another computer. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">If you are using a Cirrus video adapter and driver, you may be encountering a known problem that occurs when a Cirrus video adapter and the Cirrus driver V1.24 (driver GD5434 set to more than 16 colors) are used together. This problem is described in Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q152105, "Quick Viewer Font Problem(s) When You Remote Control to Clients;" a hot fix is available. You might also query the Knowledge Base for your hardware, "SMS," and "Remote Control."</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Check the available bandwidth. Low bandwidth can cause these kinds of problems. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Perform a ping test from the Diagnostics utility in SMS (not the TCP/IP command-line ping test) on both a successful computer and an unsuccessful computer. If bandwidth is a consideration, you should see a significant difference. For TCP/IP networks, multiply Average Packets/Second by 72 (the UDP packet size). This result must be greater than or equal to 14,400 to meet recommended minimums.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">For clients running Windows NT 3.51, try toggling the "Install Accelerated Screen Transfer on Windows NT Clients" option.</LI></UL></SPAN><H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec4"></A>Font Problems</H4><H5 CLASS="h5"><A NAME="sec5"></A>Symptoms:</H5><P CLASS="t">Fonts may be missing, may be an incorrect type, may be an incorrect size, or may be an incorrect split.</P>

SMS maps equivalent fonts, and sometimes the font does not map well. Either remove the custom fonts on the client computer, or add them to the computer running SMS Admin. For example, you might see the following custom font entry in the SYSTEM.INI [BOOT] section:</LI></UL></SPAN><P>system.drv=atmsys.drv</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="lt1">Disable the custom fonts, and restore the default setting:</P>
<P>system.drv=system.drv</P>

This problem is corrected in versions of SMS later than 1.0. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q135124, "System Keys Not Passed Through to Client Using Remote Control."</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">If this problem occurs on all clients, try installing the SMS Admin Tools on another computer with a different make of keyboard. If this computer can successfully pass keystrokes, the problem may be the keyboard or keyboard driver at the original computer running SMS Admin. If this problem occurs on only a single computer, the problem may be the keyboard or a corrupted keyboard driver on the client. Try using a different keyboard on the server, or reinstall the keyboard driver on the client. If this problem occurs with only a certain make or model of keyboard, contact Microsoft Product Support.</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t"></P></BODY></HTML>
