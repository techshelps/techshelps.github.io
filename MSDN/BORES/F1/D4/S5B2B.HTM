<H1 CLASS="cht">Chapter 1 - Deploying Software with Systems Management Server</H1><P CLASS="t">With SMS, you can deploy operating systems and applications to client computers throughout your network from a central location. This chapter discusses issues involved in deploying Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 and Office&nbsp;97.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you are planning to deploy either Windows&nbsp;NT or Office throughout your organization, you need to be thoroughly familiar with the features of and the setup program for the software. In addition to the product and product documentation, you should have available the resource kit for the product. The resource kits provide detailed information on deploying the product, as well as tools that you can use to manage the software in your organization. </P>
<P CLASS="t">PDF files are included on the Windows&nbsp;NT and Office&nbsp;97 product CD-ROMs, and on the Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit CD-ROM. You can use these PDF files as-is, modify them, or create new PDF files to distribute the software. The easiest way to create a new PDF file is to use SMS Admin to create a package, and then use WRITEPDF.EXE (from this Resource Kit) to export the package to a PDF file. If the job will need to reboot the client computer, you must then edit the PDF file, changing the value of <B>synchronousExitRequired</B> from <B>False</B> to <B>True</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you need to create a PDF and do not have access to a computer running SMS Admin, you can use PDFWIZ.EXE (also included in this Resource Kit) to create the package. However, the package will need to be reviewed and edited in SMS Admin before it is used.</P></BODY></HTML>
