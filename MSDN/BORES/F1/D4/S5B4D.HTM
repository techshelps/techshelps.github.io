<H3 CLASS="h2">Use RSERVICE To Control The PCM Service </H3><P CLASS="t">In SMS 1.2, the PCM service can be used to execute mandatory and automated system task jobs. Per-user settings cannot be configured with the PCM service.</P>
<P CLASS="t">After the PCM service has been installed on the destination computers, you can use the RSERVICE utility and the initialization file you created to start the service on those computers from the site server. The command is of the form:</P>
<P>RSERVICE /start <I>initialization_filename</I></P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">In this example, the service could be started on all the Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation computers in the EC_SALES domain with the command:</P>
<P>RSERVICE /START EC_SALES_PCMSVC.INI</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">If you want to remove the service, you can use the command:</P>
<P>RSERVICE /DEINSTALL /L EC_SALES_PCMSVC.INI</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The DEINSTALL functionality fails unless the log file switch /L is also used. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Other commands are available to control the service. For more information, see the SMS Tools Help in this Resource Kit.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note   </B>Under certain conditions, RSERVICE may report that it cannot stop or cannot start the service when it has actually succeeded. In this case, verbose output using the /V switch indicates that a WNetAddConnection2() returned error <B>87</B>. This error can be ignored. If you want to make sure the service has been stopped or started, use SMS Admin to look at the properties for the client computer, run Server Manager on the client computer, and examine the status of the individual service. </P></BODY></HTML>
