<H2 CLASS="h1">Controlling Package Share Drive Selection on Distribution Servers</H2><P CLASS="t">When you create an SMS job to distribute a package, you must select the distribution servers that should receive the package (the distribution servers are specified in the Distribute Phase section in the <B>Job Details</B> dialog box). When the job activates and the package is sent to the site server at a specified site, SMS processes the package and instruction files, and determines how the package should be distributed to the specified distribution servers. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Two types of packages are distributed to distribution servers: Packages for Workstations and Packages for Sharing. When SMS distributes these packages, it always tries to ensure that the drive on which the package is placed has enough free disk space, and that the drive is formatted as NTFS. If either of these requirements are not met, SMS will look for another drive on which to install the package. SMS will not attempt to install the package if it cannot find a drive that has enough free disk space to hold the entire package.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When SMS is first installed at a site, it creates the Default Servers group and places the site server into this group. The Default Servers are used to receive all packages if no distribution servers are specified in a job. To reduce the load and conserve disk space on the site server, it is a good idea to specify other servers to be used in the Default Servers group, and to remove the site server from this group.</P></BODY></HTML>
