<H3 CLASS="h2">Packages for Sharing</H3><P CLASS="t">SMS does not create a single share for all Packages for Sharing. When you create a Package for Sharing, you specify the share name to be used on the distribution server (this is specified in the <B>Setup Package for Sharing</B> dialog box). </P>
<P CLASS="t">You can influence the drive SMS uses to store the package by creating the share prior to starting the job that distributes the package. For instance, to share a package called Appo on the D drive of a particular distribution server, you can:</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Create the Package for Sharing, specifying the share name as AppoShare.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Create the AppoShare share on the D drive of the server.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Create the job to share the Appo package to the distribution server. </P>
<P CLASS="t">When SMS places the package onto the distribution server, it will place the package into the existing AppoShare share (instead of creating a new share).</P></BODY></HTML>
