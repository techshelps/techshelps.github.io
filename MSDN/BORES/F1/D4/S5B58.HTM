<H3 CLASS="h2">Packages for Workstations</H3><P CLASS="t">Packages for Workstations are always placed into a subdirectory of the SMS_PKG<I>x</I> share. The SMS_PKG<I>x</I> share is created on distribution servers automatically by SMS; the x corresponds to the logical drive letter (for example, if the share is created on the C: drive, the share name is SMS_PKGC). When SMS is placing a Package for Workstations onto a distribution server, it attempts to place the package on the drive that contains the SMS_PKG<I>x</I> share. If the share doesn't exist, it will attempt to create the share on the drive that contains the SMS directory and files. If the drive does not have enough free disk space, SMS will attempt to create a new SMS_PKG<I>x</I> share on the NTFS drive with the most free disk space. As a last resort, SMS will create the share on a FAT partition.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can influence which partition SMS distributes packages to by creating a new SMS_PKG<I>x</I> share on a distribution server. For instance, if your server has a SMS_PKGC share on the C partition, and you add a new drive as the D partition, you can create a new share called SMS_PKGD pointing to the D partition. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If there is more free disk space on the new partition, SMS will use it for package distributions to the server.</P></BODY></HTML>
