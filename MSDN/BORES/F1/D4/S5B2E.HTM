<H3 CLASS="h2">Creating the Windows&nbsp;NT Package in the SMS Administrator</H3><P CLASS="t">The following procedure tells you how to create a package to install Windows&nbsp;NT using the PDF included on the Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server CD-ROM. This procedure assumes that you have already created the source directory for the Windows&nbsp;NT files.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To create the package</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In <B>SMS&nbsp;Administrator</B>, open the <B>Packages</B> window. On the <B>File</B> menu, click <B>New</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">The <B>Package Properties</B> dialog box appears.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Click <B>Import</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">The <B>File Browser</B> dialog box appears.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Click the file NT40.PDF from the i386 or Alpha directory on the Windows&nbsp;NT CD-ROM, and then click <B>OK</B>. If you have copied the source files to a server, you can import the NT40.PDF file from the i386 or Alpha directory on the package server share.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Click <B>Workstations</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">The <B>Setup Package for Workstations</B> dialog box appears.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the <B>Source</B> directory box, type the location of the package source directory and then click <B>Close</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">If the package source directory will be accessed by other computers, and you choose to browse through the list of files, edit the resulting path so that it shows the UNC name (which would begin with \\<I>servername</I>\<I>sharename</I>) rather than the relative name (which would begin with the drive letter you have assigned to the server during the current session).</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Click <B>OK</B> to close all open dialog boxes.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>The "Windows&nbsp;NT Capable" Query</H4><P CLASS="t">The goal of a "Windows&nbsp;NT Capable" query is to help identify the computers that have the hardware required to run Windows&nbsp;NT. After you create and run the query, you can create a machine group with the results. This will be your target group for the jobs to install Windows&nbsp;NT. Later, you can run another query on this group to make sure the new operating system is running on the targeted computers.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note   </B>You may find it helpful to give each machine group the same descriptive name as the query you used to create the machine group. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Depending on your organization, you might want to use modified versions of a basic query. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The query should check for the following:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Current operating system</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Processor type (Intel or Alpha)</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Available hard disk space</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Installed RAM</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">To successfully upgrade a computer to Windows&nbsp;NT, the computer must have available at least 92 MB more disk space than Windows&nbsp;NT requires. At least 5 MB of this space must be on drive C of the computer; the rest can be on any local hard drive. This extra disk space is used to store files during the upgrade.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Because the PDF has multiple command lines (for installing Windows&nbsp;NT to computers currently running MS-DOS, Windows, Windows&nbsp;95, or Windows&nbsp;NT), you will need multiple queries to define the target workstations for the different platforms. This information will be used in defining the job details when you send the job to install Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To find all the Windows for Workgroups computers that can run Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation, use a query similar to the following: </P>
<P>(</P>
<P>MICROSOFT|DISK|1.0:Free Storage (MByte) is greater than or equal to '40'</P>
<P>AND</P>
<P>MICROSOFT|DISK|1.0:Disk Index is 'C'</P>
<P>)</P>
<P></P>
<P>AND</P>
<P>MICROSOFT|X86_PC_MEMORY|1.0:Total Physical Memory (KByte) is</P>
<P> <SPAN CLASS="Symbol">Þ</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"> </SPAN>greater than or equal to '16000'</P>
<P>AND</P>
<P></P>
<P>(</P>
<P>MICROSOFT|PROCESSOR|1.0:Processor Name is like '486'</P>
<P>OR</P>
<P>MICROSOFT|PROCESSOR|1.0:Processor Name is like 'PENTIUM'</P>
<P>)</P>
<P></P>
<P>AND</P>
<P>MICROSOFT|OPERATING_SYSTEM|1.0:Operating System Name is</P>
<P> <SPAN CLASS="Symbol">Þ</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"> </SPAN>'MS Windows for Workgroups'</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">This query is available in the folder SMS\Queries on the BackOffice Resource Kit CD-ROM.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SMS records the MS-DOS versions of all computers running MS-DOS, Windows, Windows for Workgroups, or Windows&nbsp;95. This means that all workstations that meet the criteria of the query will be targeted for the installation, including existing Windows&nbsp;NT computers.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note   </B>In the inventory, the MS-DOS version for Windows&nbsp;95 is recorded as version 7.0.<B> </B>SMS does not report a MS-DOS version for Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server platforms.<B> </B></P>
<P CLASS="t">You can modify the properties of the "Windows&nbsp;NT Capable" query and save it with a unique name. For example, if you have both 486 and Pentium computers that are "Windows&nbsp;NT Capable" but only want to target the Pentium computers, you would edit the query to specify this restriction. Save each of the specialized queries you create.</P></BODY></HTML>
