<H2 CLASS="h1">Interpreting SNMP Traps</H2><P CLASS="t">You can convert Windows&nbsp;NT events to SNMP traps, as described under "Debugging SNMP Traps" in the Systems Management Server Resource Guide from the first BackOffice Resource Kit. These SNMP traps can be sent to third-party network management stations, as well as to your SMS server. Since third-party software may not be able to interpret the data, however, you will need to know what information is included in the SNMP trap, and how it is organized, so that you can use the information once it arrives. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This section explains the components of the SNMP traps created by the Event to Trap Translator. It also explains why you may choose to use the trap-trimming feature, and how to implement trap trimming.</P></BODY></HTML>
