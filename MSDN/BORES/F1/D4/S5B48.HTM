<H3 CLASS="h2">Installing the PCM Service on SMS 1.2 Clients</H3><P CLASS="t">You can install the PCM service on any Windows&nbsp;NT workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT stand-alone server (x86 or Alpha) that is a member of a Windows&nbsp;NT domain and is an SMS 1.2 client. The PCM service cannot be installed on workstations that are members of a workgroup, rather than a domain.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Most of the work involved in installing the PCM service can be done automatically, using the RSERVICE utility (Remote Service Utility). In addition, RSERVICE can be used to start, stop, or query the status of the service whenever necessary, thereby simplifying the management of the PCM service on all Windows&nbsp;NT computers in a single domain. In fact, RSERVICE can be used to control any service on multiple computers within a domain. The control options include installing, starting, stopping, removing, querying the status of, and pausing a service, or sending a control code to a service.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The RSERVICE utility is a console application. The data required to control a service using RSERVICE must be supplied in an initialization file. Once the initialization file has been created, the service can be controlled with a single command line. The RSERVICE utility is documented in the online Help for the SMS Resource Kit. Specific information for creating an initialization file for the PCM service is provided in the following section. RSERVICE is documented in the online Help for the BackOffice Resource Kit, and in Chapter 4, "Tools," in this Guide.</P>
