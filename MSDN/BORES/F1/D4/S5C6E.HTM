<H3 CLASS="h2">FILEMOVE.EXE: File Mover </H3><P CLASS="t">File Mover allows you to automatically move or copy files from a selected source directory to a specified destination directory. It actually consists of two utilities: FILEMOVE.EXE and FMUI.EXE. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Caution   </B>SMS uses files to schedule tasks and other events. Moving these files with File Mover may interfere with the proper operation of SMS. </P>
<P CLASS="t">FILEMOVE.EXE runs on the target system (the computer that you want to monitor) and periodically configures itself according to the values in the local system's registry. It monitors files in the specified source directory, either by polling the directory at set intervals or by using Windows NT Directory Change events. When the specified files are found, it moves or copies the files to the destination directory. FILEMOVE.EXE writes its status to its log file (FILEMOVE.LOG). When this log file reaches its maximum size, it is closed and renamed FILEMOVE.LO_. A new FILEMOVE.LOG file is then created.</P>
<P CLASS="t">FMUI.EXE is the utility that you use to get and set the registry values that configure FILEMOVE.EXE. (These registry values are located in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\SMS_FILE_MOVER). FMUI.EXE can run on any computer that has local or network access to the registry of the computer that is running FILEMOVE. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The following values are set with the FMUI utility (these are the values in the FMUI utility itself, not in the registry):</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>Computer Name</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The name of the target computer running FILEMOVE.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>File Mask to Scan</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The filter that FILEMOVE should use to select the files to be moved or copied. Defaults to all files (*.*) if no mask is specified.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>Source Directory to Monitor</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The directory from which to move or copy files. FILEMOVE will not work if this directory is not specified or if the specified directory does not exist.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>Destination Directory</B> </P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The directory to which to move or copy files. FILEMOVE will not work if this directory is not specified or if the specified directory does not exist.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>Log File location</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The full path to the FILEMOVE log file. Defaults to C:\.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>File size in Kbytes</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The size of the FILEMOVE log file, specified in kilobytes. Defaults to 128K.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>Wait for Directory Change Event</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Selecting the checkbox specifies that FILEMOVE should use Windows NT Directory Change notification to monitor files. Clearing the checkbox specifies that FILEMOVE should use polling.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>Poll Source Directory every </B><B><I>nn </I></B><B>seconds</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1"><I>nn</I> specifies the default polling interval for FILEMOVE. It is only valid if polling has been specified.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>Delete files after copying</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Selecting the checkbox specifies that FILEMOVE should move the files to the destination directory (and delete the source files). Clearing the checkbox specifies that FILEMOVE should simply copy the files (and leave the source files intact).</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>Overwrite duplicate filenames</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Selecting the checkbox specifies that FILEMOVE should overwrite duplicate files in the destination directory. Clearing the checkbox specifies that FILEMOVE should change duplicate filenames so that no files are lost. If FILEMOVE changes any file names, the change is written to the FILEMOVE log file. </P>

<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>FILEMOVE Syntax</H4><P CLASS="t">FILEMOVE can be run as an executable or as a service. In both cases, it requires Administrator rights on the computer to be monitored. It will also need rights to the source directory, the destination directory, and the local registry.
