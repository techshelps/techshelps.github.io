<H3 CLASS="h2">SMGENIE.EXE: Event Generator</H3><P CLASS="t">SMGENIE generates events that simulate actual system and application events. The purpose of SMGENIE is to test the SNMP Event to Trap Translator, which converts preselected events to SNMP traps when the events are written to the Windows&nbsp;NT Event Log. </P>
<P CLASS="t">After SMGENIE is started, the SMGENIE window appears on your screen. </P>

<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Using SMGENIE </H4><P CLASS="t">Once SMS is installed and the SNMP components are set up, you can configure the SNMP Event to Trap Translator with the events to be translated (see the SMS Administrator's Guide). Then use SMGENIE to generate events to the Windows&nbsp;NT event log; events that have been set in the SNMP Event to Trap Translator will be translated into traps and sent to the site server. </P>
<P CLASS="proch">To Generate Events with SMGENIE</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select an event log from the <B>Event Logs</B> box. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select an event source from the <B>Event Sources</B> box. </P>
<P CLASS="lt1">The events for the selected event source are displayed in the list at the top of the window. The number of events available in the event source are displayed in the <B>Event Count</B> box. </P>
<P CLASS="lt1">You can use the <B>Auto Search</B> box to locate an event source among all the event logs. In the <B>Auto Search</B> box, type the name of a source. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select events by scrolling through the list and clicking on them. </P>
<P CLASS="lt1">SHIFT CLICK and CTRL CLICK can be used to select ranges and multiple events. The number of selected events is shown in the lower-right status bar. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Change the default <B>Sub-string,</B> if necessary. The default is TEST-STRING. </P>
<P CLASS="lt1">The <B>Sub-string</B> is placed into each event wherever there is a percent sign (%) followed by a number. (In actual Windows&nbsp;NT event generation, subsequent numbers denote different strings. In SMGENIE, <B>Sub-string</B> is used regardless of the number following the percent sign.) </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Generate events in one of two ways: </P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI2">Click <B>Generate Events</B>. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI2">In the <B>Auto Generate</B> box, specify integers for <B>Multiples</B> and <B>Interval in Seconds</B>, then select <B>Auto Generate</B>. <B>Multiples</B> specifies how many events to generate for each selected event, and <B>Interval in Seconds</B> specifies how often to generate them, repeating until <B>Auto Generate</B> is no longer selected. 
<P CLASS="lt1">For example, if Winlogon is the event source, events 1001 and 1002 are selected, and the default settings are used, selecting <B>Auto Generate</B> generates one of each event every five seconds. Two events are logged in the Windows&nbsp;NT Event Log every five seconds; one for event 1001, and one for event 1002. </P></LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="lt1">The number of events generated is shown in the lower-left status bar.</P></BODY></HTML>
