<H3 CLASS="h2">Special Cases</H3><P CLASS="t">Microsoft has tested the use of PCM service for installing several applications and operating systems. Clean installations were tested, as well as upgrades. The tests used client computers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server, version 3.51 with Service Pack 5 and version 4.0 with Service Pack 1.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This section provides you with special-case information gathered in these tests.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Installing Office&nbsp;95 on Computers Running Windows&nbsp;NT </H4><P CLASS="t">For both Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server, versions 3.51 and 4.0, the files for Office&nbsp;95 are installed correctly by the PCM service. While Office&nbsp;95 is being installed, it makes no difference which account is logged on at the computer, or even whether anyone is logged on at all. Job status usually remains Active even after the job is completed, although in some cases it correctly changes to complete.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the computer is running Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0, Office&nbsp;95 items are not generally added to the <B>Start</B> menu. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If the computer is running Windows&nbsp;NT 3.51, no program groups or icons are created for Office&nbsp;95.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In all cases, the Office&nbsp;95 components work correctly when run from the executables (for example by double-clicking the MSACCESS.EXE file in File&nbsp;Manager or in Windows&nbsp;NT Explorer).</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Installing Office&nbsp;97 on Computers Running Windows&nbsp;NT </H4><P CLASS="t">For both Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and Windows&nbsp;NT Server, versions 3.51 and 4.0, the PCM service installs the files for Office&nbsp;97 properly. While Office&nbsp;97 is being installed, it makes no difference what account is logged in at the computer, or even whether anyone is logged in at all.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the computer is running Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0, <B>Start</B> menu items are created as expected, and they apply to all accounts. However, if a new account is added after Office&nbsp;97 is installed, that account will have two sets of <B>Start</B> menu items: one in the lower, common program groups section, and another in the upper, individual section. The items in the common section work properly. The items in the individual section do not work properly, and should be removed manually. (From the <B>Start</B> menu point to <B>Settings</B>, then choose <B>Taskbar</B> and go to the <B>Start Menu Programs</B> tab.)</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the computer is running Windows&nbsp;NT 3.51, no program groups or icons are created for Office&nbsp;97.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In all cases, the Office&nbsp;97 components work correctly when run from the executables (for example by double-clicking the MSACCESS.EXE file in File&nbsp;Manager or in Windows&nbsp;NT Explorer).</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Upgrading From Office&nbsp;95 to Office&nbsp;97 </H4><P CLASS="t">In the PCM tests, Office&nbsp;95 was first installed manually, to simulate the typical case in which the applications are already installed. </P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>On Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 4.0 </H5><P CLASS="t">The upgrade using the PCM service is fully functional. Items for Office&nbsp;97 applications are added to the common <B>Start</B> menu. In addition, an account that already had Office&nbsp;97 applications in its <B>Start</B> menu now has these items in both the lower, common portion of the <B>Start</B> menu and in the upper, individual portion of the <B>Start</B> menu. All of these items function properly. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Most Office&nbsp;95 files are replaced with proxy files that invoke the equivalent Office&nbsp;97 application when double-clicked. The Office&nbsp;97 directory tree is fully populated, and the files there work correctly when double-clicked.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec4"></A>On Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 3.51 </H5><P CLASS="t">The Office&nbsp;97 directory tree is fully populated, and the files there work correctly when double-clicked, from any account. Most Office&nbsp;95 files are replaced with proxy files that invoke the equivalent Office&nbsp;97 application when double-clicked. However, no new program groups and icons are created for the Office&nbsp;97 applications, and the old program groups and icons point to the Office&nbsp;95 executable files. Since the Office&nbsp;95 executable files have been replaced with proxy files, clicking the icons does not start the applications. To change the icon so that it points to the new files, select the icon and choose <B>Properties</B> from the <B>File </B>menu.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec5"></A>Upgrading Windows&nbsp;NT Operating Systems </H4><P CLASS="t">The upgrade process works as usual when upgrading Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 3.51 (Service Pack 4) to Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation 3.51 Service Pack 5, or from Windows&nbsp;NT Server 4.0 (no Service Pack) to Windows&nbsp;NT Server (Service Pack&nbsp;1).</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you will be using the PCM service to upgrade from Windows&nbsp;NT 3.51 (Service Pack 5) to Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0, edit the command-line properties in the Windows&nbsp;NT upgrade PDF, replacing <B>ntencap.exe /NTw</B> with <B>start</B>. Because the NTENCAP.EXE program cannot detect a system reboot from a service, any job involving a reboot would fail to complete if you use NTENCAP. Therefore it should not be used with the PCM service.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note   </B>When using PCM service to upgrade to Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0, there will be no detailed status report on the job. Also, the job may never be reported as Complete, even after it has completed successfully. This is because jobs that require a reboot may not provide PCMSVC32 enough time to write a complete status back to the logon server. In addition, if the PCMSVC32 polling interval is set to a value that is too fast, it may attempt to process an instruction a second time following the reboot, before the site has had time to process the completion of the first execution. This condition should correct itself in time, but can be prevented by keeping the PCMSVC32 polling interval set at one hour or more and the site response speed at "Fast" (the default.)</P></BODY></HTML>
