<H3 CLASS="h2">Preparing the Source Directory</H3><P CLASS="t">Use the following procedure to create and populate a package source directory for your Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and/or Windows&nbsp;NT Server source files. This directory will also contain the answer files (UNATTEND.TXT) and uniqueness database files (UDFs) that allow you to deploy Windows&nbsp;NT without user intervention at the target computers.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To create a package source directory</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Create a source directory for the Windows&nbsp;NT operating system files. Within this source directory, create subdirectories for each processor type (i386, Alpha, or MIPS). </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Share the directory using a share name that is identical to the directory name.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">From a client computer or from the server containing the package source directory, log on to the network and connect to the share you created.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Insert the Windows&nbsp;NT CD-ROM and use the <B>xcopy</B> command to install the operating system files in the package source directory. Copy all the files for every platform supported in your organization, preserving the directory structure on the CD-ROM or installation disks. For example, if your organization uses x86-based computers but not Alpha or MIPS computers, you would need to copy the \i386 directory tree (but not the \Alpha and \MIPS directory trees) to your package source directory. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Copy the UNATTEND.TXT file from the Windows&nbsp;NT 4.0 CD-ROM to the source directory.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI2">If you will be targeting Windows&nbsp;NT systems for upgrade, copy UNATTEND.TXT to NTUPGRD.400.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI2">If you will be targeting MS-DOS or Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, or Windows&nbsp;95 clients for upgrade, copy UNATTEND.TXT to UNATTEND.400.</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="ls">Modify the UNATTEND.400 and NTUPGRD.400 files for installation as required by your configuration. See the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation Resource Guide </I>for details. (This book is included online in the Windows&nbsp;NT Server Resource Kit).</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">In the UNATTEND.400 file, leave the ComputerName entry (in the [UserData] section) blank if you want SMS to fill in this value using the one specified in the SMS.INI file, or if you will be using a Uniqueness Database File (UDF) to tailor the installation to individual computers. For information on creating answer files and UDF files see Part I, "Deployment Guide," in the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation Resource Guide</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Copy your UDF and any other files used in a customized setup to the package source directory. If you will be installing applications along with Windows&nbsp;NT, the files for those applications also need to be copied to the source directory. Chapter 2, "Customizing Setup," in the <I>Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation Resource Guide</I> explains the directory structure to use for these files.</P></BODY></HTML>
