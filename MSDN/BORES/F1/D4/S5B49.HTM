<H3 CLASS="h2">Establish the User Account to be Used by the PCM Service</H3><P CLASS="t">In addition to creating the initialization file, you must do the following:</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Create a domain user account that the PCM service will use. Log on as a domain administrator and open User Manager for Domains to create the account.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">While still in User Manager for Domains, add the user account to the Domain Admins global user group. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Ensure that the Domain Admins global user has administrative authority on the Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation computers in the domain. By default, Windows&nbsp;NT computers grant Local Admins group membership to the Domain Admins global group. If this default behavior has been changed on computers in your organization, you may need to manually add the account designated for the PCM service to the local administrators group on those computers. The account used by the PCM service must also have "Log on as a Service" privilege on the local computer.</P></BODY></HTML>
