<H3 CLASS="h2">Validate the Windows&nbsp;NT Deployment</H3><P CLASS="t">After deployment, evaluate the distribution results on the upgraded clients. Note that a Complete job status does not necessarily indicate successful deployment of Windows&nbsp;NT. You must perform additional analysis to determine the results of deployment:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Make sure that the SMS client inventory has been updated for all clients in the target group.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Use queries to determine whether the upgrade succeeded. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Test the clients that were successfully upgraded to ensure that the configuration you specified works as expected on these computers. </LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">Some computers in your target group may not have been successfully upgraded. You can deal with these on a case-by-case basis. Here are a few of the things you can check in these cases:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">If you marked the <B>Inventory This Package</B> check box in the <B>Setup</B> <B>Package for Inventory</B> dialog box when you created the package, you can examine a copy of the Setup log file created on each target computer. Study this file to determine the cause of any problems. For example, there might have been changes in available disk space or in the availability of some other resource between the time the computer was added to the target group and the time the upgrade was performed.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Check the details of job events to troubleshoot problems. For example, if a job has failed because the answer file (for example, UNATTEND.400) was not available where it was expected, this would be reported in the job events.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Determine whether any individual clients, which may have failed during the Windows&nbsp;NT upgrade process, are no longer operational.
<P CLASS="lt1">Clients that are no longer operational are not updated in the SMS inventory. You might choose to perform the inventory at more frequent intervals before deployment to make sure that only currently operational computers are targeted. In some cases, you might want to develop an SMS query to identify clients that have not had their inventory updated. </P></LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Determine whether a faulty hardware component caused a failure of the Windows&nbsp;NT upgrade process.</LI></UL></SPAN></BODY></HTML>
