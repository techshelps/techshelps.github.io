<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Report Formats</H4><P CLASS="t">Crystal Reports for Microsoft Exchange incorporates two types of reports: Report Templates and Report Instances. </P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Report Templates</H5><SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">A Report Template is not mapped to a physical file. It exists as a hidden message within a folder and is only accessible from within the Microsoft Exchange Client. To access a Report Template, you must choose a menu command. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">A Report Template is similar to a Microsoft Exchange folder contents list view in that you can only see data from a single folder. The Report Template cannot display information from multiple folders. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Because data within a Microsoft Exchange folder is constantly updated, a Report Template does not contain saved data. It is associated with data contained in a public folder.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">A Report Template may be either a Personal Report or a Folder Report. A Personal Report, similar to a Microsoft Exchange view, can be applied to any folder. A Folder Report, however, is associated with one specific folder. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">You can access a Report Template by using the folder's property page or by choosing a command from the <B>View</B> menu. However, Report Template management (that is, creation, deletion, or modification) can only be accomplished by selecting options in the folder's property page. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">A Report Template can only be applied from the <B>View</B> menu.</LI></UL></SPAN><H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Report Instances</H5><SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">A Report Instance is a file with an .rpt extension. The file can reside within a Microsoft Exchange folder or elsewhere on your computer.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">As with a Microsoft Word document, you can copy a Report Instance to a Microsoft Exchange folder by using drag-and-drop operations. You can also copy a Report Instance to a folder by using the Export function in either Crystal Reports Designer or Crystal Reports Viewer. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">A Report Instance can be saved with or without data. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">A Report Instance with current data contains a snapshot of data for comparison or storage purposes. This provides a way for an administrator to archive mail. </LI></UL></SPAN></BODY></HTML>
