<H3 CLASS="h2">Using ATTMWIZ</H3><P CLASS="t">The AT&amp;T Mail Migration Wizard assumes that the Microsoft Exchange Client profile is in place before migrating messages. If the profile is not in place, the wizard asks that a profile be created. The user name and Microsoft Exchange Server name (and password, for Windows for Workgroups or Windows 3.1) are needed to gain access to the server-based message store.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Access PLUS and PMX message files should be available locally or on an MS-DOS compatible network drive. If the mail directory resides on a network system that cannot be reached, copy the files to your local drive using a network utility such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP).</P>
<P CLASS="t">When you migrate PMX mail, file names greater than eight characters are truncated. Also, PMX files must be transferred in binary mode, otherwise the file format is corrupted during the transfer.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note   </B>If you use a remote network to store personal folders, the network connection must be started before logging into the associated profile.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Encrypted Messages</H4><P CLASS="t">All encrypted messages must be decrypted prior to performing the migration process. The AT&amp;T Mail Migration Wizard cannot decode encrypted messages. </P>
<P CLASS="proch">To migrate mail messages</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the <B>Choose Source Directory</B> box, enter the path that contains the mail messages for Access PLUS 2.7 or PMX. The default selection is C:\Attmsg.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">To migrate mail into an existing folder, select <B>Put messages into existing personal folders</B>, and then select an existing Microsoft Exchange Client mail delivery location. The mail delivery location can be a server-based store or a personal folder.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">To migrate mail into a new folder, select <B>Put messages into new personal folders</B>, type a path and file name for the new personal folder, and then choose <B>Next</B>. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Verify that the options selected are accurate, and then choose <B>Convert</B>. </P>
<P CLASS="lt1">If you are placing the migrated mail in a new folder, supply the information requested to further define the new personal folder. For more information, choose <B>Help</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">When the migration process starts, the Access PLUS and PMX mail messages are migrated to the selected location. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Migrating Electronic Forms</H4><P CLASS="t">One of the special message types migrated from Access PLUS and PMX is the electronic form, which uses protected fields. When forms are migrated to the Microsoft Exchange Client, they lose their functionality. If the form is mailed back to another recipient, the recipient receives a message containing only text, without the ability to enter values into fields. You need to recreate your forms using the Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Addressing Issues</H4><P CLASS="t">Because Microsoft Exchange Server addresses messages differently from the typical "bang" (!) style addresses, you cannot reply to a message that was migrated from Access PLUS or PMX. If you reply to a migrated message, a non-delivery report (NDR) is returned to the sender.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To restart an interrupted migration or to migrate messages that arrive after the migration</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Restart the AT&amp;T Mail Migration Wizard. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">The AT&amp;T Mail Migration Wizard determines that a previous message conversion has been attempted and prompts you to choose whether it should process all messages again.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Choose <B>No</B> to convert only those messages that were not converted during the previous migration. If you choose <B>Yes</B>, you may receive duplicate messages if multiple migrations are needed.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1"><B>Note   </B>After a migration has been completed, subsequent migrations can result in duplicate messages.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Migration Summary Information</H4><P CLASS="t">After the migration is complete, a <B>Summary</B> box displays the number of messages processed and the number of messages logged. This can be helpful in ensuring that all of the messages were migrated to the Microsoft Exchange Client.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In the <B>Summary</B> box, choose <B>View Log</B> to view a file that logs which messages or files were not processed, start and end times, and other information.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Messages that were located in an Access PLUS or PMX Out folder are stored in a new Microsoft Exchange Client personal folder called Converted Out. Messages in the Access PLUS or PMX In folder are stored in a personal folder named Inbox.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec4"></A>Improving Migration Performance</H4><P CLASS="t">The following tips may decrease the time it takes to migrate messages. </P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">If the Access PLUS or PMX messages are located on a network drive, the migration process runs much slower, depending on network traffic. To avoid an unnecessarily long migration process, copy the source message directory tree to the local hard disk.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">If the personal folder you are migrating messages to is located on the network, consider moving it to a local drive during the migration process.</LI></UL></SPAN></BODY></HTML>
