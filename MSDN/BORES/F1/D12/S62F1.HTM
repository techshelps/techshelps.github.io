<H3 CLASS="h2">Restoring All User Messages on the New Server</H3><P CLASS="t">Before following the procedure outlined below, make sure that the Microsoft Exchange Directory service is running and that the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service is not running on Server B. </P>
<P CLASS="proch">To restore user messages on the new server</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Copy the Priv.edb file from the Mdbdata directory of the Server A backup to the Mdbdata directory on Server B.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">Now you should have two files in the Mdbdata directory of Server B: the Privd.edb file that was copied from the Server A backup and the Pub.edb file that was in the Mdbdata directory on Server B.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">Do not copy Pub.edb from the Server A backup. There should be no .log or .chk files in the Mdbdata directory of Server B.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">At the command prompt, switch to the Exchsrver\Bin directory.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Type <B>ISINTEG -Patch</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In Control Panel, double-click the <B>Services</B> icon, and then start the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service on Server B.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the Administrator window, select Server B.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">From the <B>File</B> menu, choose <B>Properties</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select the <B>Advanced </B>tab, select the <B>All Inconsistencies</B> option, and then choose <B>Adjust</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">All mailboxes should now be migrated to Server B. As long as the Microsoft Exchange Directory service is running on Server A, all users should be able to log on to the Microsoft Exchange Client by using their old profiles. Even though the profiles point to Server A, the Microsoft Exchange Directory service on Server A automatically redirects the client to Server B and the profile is modified to point to Server B.</P></BODY></HTML>
