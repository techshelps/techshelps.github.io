<H3 CLASS="h2">Saving Organizational Forms</H3><P CLASS="t">If you have organization-wide forms, follow the procedure below.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To save your organizational forms</P>
<P CLASS="ls">While still in the Microsoft Exchange Client, create a new personal folder called "OrgForms." </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select the new folder.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">From the <B>File</B> menu, choose <B>Properties</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select the <B>Forms</B> tab.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Choose <B>Set</B>, and then select <B>Organization Forms</B>. This is the name of the folder that was specified using the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program (under <B>Tools\Forms Administrator</B>).</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select all the forms listed in the list on the left, and with all the forms highlighted, choose <B>Copy</B>. This copies all the selected forms to the list on the right. All the forms in the list are then copied to the OrgForms personal folder that you created in step one. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Repeat these steps for each forms library.</P>
<P CLASS="t">As mentioned earlier, you cannot copy the Pub.edb file from Server A to Server B and expect all the public folders to be available on Server B. After you copy Pub.edb to Server B, and run the ISINTEG troubleshooting utility and the DS/IS consistency adjuster, the public folders on Server A will still not be available on Server B. Only after you display the public information store properties on Server B, select the <B>Instances</B> tab and add all the public folders to be homed on Server B, will these folders be available. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note   </B>The <B>Instances</B> tab is not available with Microsoft Exchange Server, Standard Edition. Because Standard Edition servers are stand-alone servers, they do not have the ability to store replicas of public folders.</P></BODY></HTML>
