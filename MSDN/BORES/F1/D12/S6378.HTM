<H3 CLASS="h2">Monitoring Backup Logs and the Windows NT EventLog</H3><P CLASS="t">When online backup of the information store fails, this may indicate that your information store is running in an inconsistent state. For this reason, it is critical to review backup logs and the Windows NT EventLog on a regular basis.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In this case, the following errors appeared in the Windows NT EventLog:</P>
<P>Event ID: 23 ; Source: EDB; Type: Error; Category: Database Page Cache; Description: MSMicrosoft ExchangeIS ((458) Direct read found corrupted page error -1018 ((-1:550144) (0-589866), 486912  1162627398  3480849804). Please restore the database from a previous backup.</P>
<P>Event ID: 8010; Source: NTBACKUP; Type: Error; Category: None; Description:  Microsoft Exchange services returned 'c80003fa' from a call to 'BackupRead()' additional data.</P>
<P></P>

Until the problem could be resolved, an offline backup strategy had to be put into effect. The batch file described earlier in this chapter, in "Sample Batch File for Offline Backup: Example 2" section, was used with the Windows NT AT Command Scheduler to perform the following functions:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Shut down Microsoft Exchange Server services.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Perform an offline backup.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Restart Microsoft Exchange Server. </LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">Note that in this case, the information store appeared acceptable from a user perspective and remained functional during business hours. </P></BODY></HTML>
