<H2 CLASS="h1">Mailbox Migration Tool</H2><P CLASS="t">The purpose of the tool is to make a complete copy of the mailbox content from one server to another when these servers are in different sites and/or organizations. The utility does not assume there is direct network connectivity between any two servers and its basic mechanism is to create a personal folder file (.pst) which contains the structure and messages of the mailbox to be copied. In addition, this tool is used to recreate rules and directory information. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This tool augments the Exchange Administrators Move Mailbox option which only allows you to move a mailbox between servers within the same site. Using this utility, you can move mailboxes between sites.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This tool is useful for the following functions:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">When a user or number of users move locations and need to have a mailbox in a different Microsoft Exchange Site. This utility can be used to copy the mailbox content (folder structure , messages and rules) to the new mailbox in the new site.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">When an organization changes its structure, either breaking up the current Microsoft Exchange organizational unit into a number of smaller ones or merging organizational units. In either of these situations, mailboxes need to be moved into new sites (and possibly to different organizations).</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">When an organization is moving from a pilot Microsoft Exchange Server implementation to a production roll-out and they require mailboxes to be moved between these two systems. This tool is particularly useful in this situation when a large number of users need to be moved. </LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">The tool assumes that a mailbox exists in the new site/organization and it will copy folders and messages into this new mailbox. Since a period of time can elapse between copying the mailbox content from the mailbox to the personal folder store and then copying from the personal folder store to the new mailbox, the old mailbox is not deleted. Rules are created on the old mailbox to forward messages onto the new mailbox. It is the responsibility of the Microsoft Exchange Administrator to delete the old mailboxes.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note   </B>The Mailbox Migration tool will only run on Windows NT Workstation. Also, it is not possible to run multiple copies of the Mailbox Migration tool on the same workstation. Although it is possible to run the application on different workstations against different servers at the same time, this can impact the configuration.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To run the Mailbox Migration tool</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">You need a working Microsoft Exchange Client that can connect to both the pilot and production servers to be used. There are no limits on the mailbox size (on either the pilot or production systems). However, the client workstation should have at least 100MB of free space for creation of the .pst file.</LI></UL></SPAN></BODY></HTML>
