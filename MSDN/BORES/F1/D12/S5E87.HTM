<H3 CLASS="h2">Using the Administrative Mailbox Agent</H3><P CLASS="t">To use the Administrative Mailbox Agent for creating new accounts, send a message to the Administrative Agent with "NEW" as the subject heading. The body of the message must include the Windows NT account name, and the first and last names of the new Microsoft Exchange user.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To create new accounts</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the Microsoft Exchange Client Viewer, open a new message. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the message, choose <B>To</B>, and then select the name of the Agent from the Address Book. For example, if you chose the name "Admin Agent" for the Agent during installation, then this name will appear in the Address Book.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the <B>Subject</B> box, type <B>NEW</B>. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">If you are administering more than one messaging container, type the name of the container in X.500-style notation. For example, if you want to request a new user for the container "/cn=Recipients/cn=Office1042," type <B>NEW /cn=Recipients/cn=Office1042</B> in the <B>Subject</B> box.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the message body, type one or more lines in the following format:</P>
<P CLASS="lt1"><B>&lt;Windows NT account name&gt;,&lt;Microsoft Exchange first name&gt;,&lt;Microsoft Exchange last name&gt;</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">The following figure shows a request for a new account for Bill Lee.</P>
<P CLASS="a"><img src="xerk_f01.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">If you have more than one container to administer, the message sent will include the container name after the word "NEW" in the <B>Subject</B> box. </P>
<P CLASS="t">After you send your request, the Administrator Mailbox Agent creates Windows&nbsp;NT and Microsoft Exchange accounts with the specified Windows NT account names and corresponding first and last names. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If you have permission to use the Agent, a confirmation message is sent, as shown in the figure below. This message lets you know that the accounts have been created. As mentioned earlier, you must have the appropriate permissions to create accounts with the Administrative Mailbox Agent. If you do not have permission to create accounts, a message is returned stating that fact.</P>
<P CLASS="a">    <img src="xerk_f02.gif"></P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Deleting Accounts</H4><P CLASS="t">To use the Administrative Mailbox Agent for deleting new accounts, send a message to the Agent with the word "DELETE" in the <B>Subject</B> box and message body text that contains the name of the Windows NT account and the first and last name of the new Microsoft Exchange user.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Granting Access Permissions</H4><P CLASS="t">The Administrative Mailbox Agent needs to know which administrators have the access permissions required to request the creation or deletion of accounts. You can grant access permissions to other administrators by using the Admins.csv<I> </I>file. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The Admins.csv file is usually located in the directory where the Administrative Mailbox Agent was installed (for example, C:\Admin). Note that the directory where Admins.csv is stored must be indicated somewhere in the system path for Microsoft Exchange Server to find it. </P>
<P CLASS="proch">To add the Admins.csv directory to your system path</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In<B> </B>Control Panel, double-click the <B>System</B> icon.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select the <B>Environment</B> tab, and then type the directory path in the <B>Variable</B> box.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">To ensure that the directory path is added to your system path, choose <B>Set</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Admins.csv. file is a text file that contains a record for each administrator in comma-separated-value (CSV) format. This file can be edited in Notepad or any other text editor. You can also edit Admin.csv by using Microsoft Excel (which natively handles CSV files), as shown in the figure below.</P>
<P CLASS="a"><img src="xerk_f03.gif"></P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Admins.csv Fields</H4><SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1"><B>Display Name</B> — The first field for each record includes the display name of each administrator. If the administrator's name is "Lee, Bill," then the first field on the line should read "Lee, Bill." The quotation marks are necessary due to the embedded comma, but if you are editing in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Excel places the quotation marks around the field automatically. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"><B>Server</B> — The second field displays the name of the Microsoft Exchange Server computer that all the administrators' accounts are stored on. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"><B>Recipients Container</B> — The third field displays the Recipients container for all users. When working in this field, use X.500-style directory notation. For example, to place users in the top-level Recipients container, type <B>/cn=Recipients</B>. 
<P CLASS="lt1">To place users in the container called "Office1," type <B>/cn=Recipients/cn=Office1</B>. </P></LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"><B>Windows NT Domain</B> — The fourth field displays the Windows NT domain that you want to create Windows NT accounts in, or link to. If this field is left blank, the current Windows NT domain for the Microsoft Exchange Server computer is assumed. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"><B>Permissions Levels</B> 

<UL><LI CLASS="ULI2"><B>Level 3</B>: Set the permissions level to 3 if you want to enable an administrator to delete Windows NT and Microsoft Exchange accounts with the Administrative Mailbox Agent</LI><LI CLASS="ULI2"><B>Level 2</B>: Set the permissions level to 2 if you want to enable an administrator to create Windows NT and Exchange accounts with the Agent. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI2"><B>Level 1</B>: Set the permissions level to 1 if you want to enable an administrator to link to previously created Windows NT and Exchange accounts, but not to create or delete accounts with the Agent.</LI></UL><P CLASS="lt1"><B>Note   </B>You can enter the same administrator's name more than once in the Admins.csv file. In fact, you need to do so if the administrator is responsible for more than one container. However, this forces the administrator to send requests that specify which container to use.</P></LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">The next figure shows the same Admins.csv file in Notepad format. Note that the first line of column headings is optional. Include this line if you want to clarify the type of information in each field. </P>
