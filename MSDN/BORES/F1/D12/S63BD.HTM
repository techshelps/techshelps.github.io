<H2 CLASS="h1">Backing Up Inbox Assistant Rules</H2><P CLASS="t">You can back up rules that users have specified while using the Inbox Assistant in the Microsoft Exchange Client. In some cases, users have specified a large number of rules in their Inbox Assistant. While these rules are simple to recreate, it is easier to back up the rules after they have been set. Then the rules can be restored as needed. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The following steps describe how to copy all of your Inbox Assistant rules to a personal folder file (.pst). After you complete these steps, you can remove the Personal Folder service and store the .pst file in a safe location. If you lose your Inbox rules, you can restore them from that .pst file.</P>
