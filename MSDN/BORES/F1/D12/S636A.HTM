<H3 CLASS="h2">Disable SCSI Controller Write Cache</H3><P CLASS="t">To avoid the potential for data loss, disable the small computer system interface (SCSI) controller write cache. At a programming level, if the write-through flag is set, Windows NT will not use buffers and therefore, when a program receives a write complete signal from Windows NT, it is guaranteed that the write was completed to disk. This is critical to the Microsoft Exchange Server transaction logging process. If write cache is enabled, Windows NT thinks that a write has been made to disk and will inform the calling application of this false information. This could result in data corruption if a crash is experienced before this lazy-write operation makes it to disk.</P></BODY></HTML>
