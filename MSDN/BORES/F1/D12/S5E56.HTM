<H3 CLASS="h2">Trey Research: Taking Full Advantage of the Microsoft Exchange Server Programmable Interface</H3><P CLASS="t">Trey Research is a diversified global financial investment company whose organizations provide personal banking, investment counseling and sales, and financial market and economic analysis for internal and external customers. As with Fabrikam, Inc., this company has chosen to standardize its messaging system on Microsoft Exchange Server for a variety of reasons. Key to its decision is the native X.400 and Internet connectivity in Microsoft Exchange Server. This capability is not only an internal standard—it enables the company to share information with its many international customers and information suppliers. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Another key advantage of Microsoft Exchange Server is its ability to build custom applications that integrate the company's desktop application suite with Microsoft Exchange Server. Management at Trey Research plans to take advantage of the built-in customization ability of Microsoft Exchange Server to provide users with quick access to the information they need and the ability to use their desktop tools to analyze and format the information. </P>
<P CLASS="t">These capabilities will be provided through customized applications, which will enable users to use Microsoft Exchange Server public folders as repositories for status reports or downloaded news feeds, and then output that data to Microsoft Office applications for spreadsheet analysis, graphing, and charting. After the data analysis has been completed, the new statistical information will be placed in a Microsoft Exchange Server public folder accessible only to executives for review and comment. By using the replication facility in Microsoft Exchange Server as a distributed information transport, and by using the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service to connect Microsoft Exchange Server sites, Trey Research will ensure that important information is distributed automatically to its offices worldwide.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Trey Research also plans to use Schedule+ for project scheduling by linking data maintained in public folders, Microsoft Project, and Schedule+. Microsoft Exchange Server can also enable the company to take advantage of its investment in Visual Basic training for their corporate developers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In short, Trey Research plans to take advantage of the same capabilities that Fabrikam, Inc. found useful, and the following additional application design benefits of Microsoft Exchange Server, including:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1"><B>Scalable tools for application design</B> — Many of the solutions Trey Research evaluated as possible workgroup and e-mail infrastructures could only support a limited amount of functionality, or required highly skilled and expensive development resources to implement. Now Trey Research has the tools needed to build applications quickly and to enable their internal development staff to customize applications without worrying about exceeding the functionality available through these tools.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"><B>Native support for Internet standards</B> — Trey Research can develop applications that gather relevant information from the Internet and distribute it to its other Microsoft Exchange Server sites worldwide, over an Internet backbone. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"><B>Integration with the Microsoft Office applications suite</B> — Trey Research wants to make the most of its investment in Office by integrating its groupware and e-mail with desktop applications and by adopting a common programmable interface for the two. As a result, users can work with a familiar interface, even with custom applications. In addition, the company's development staff will have a common tool set and programming interface available in Office applications—Visual Basic and the scripting language of Visual Basic for Applications—to integrate desktop applications into workgroup solutions. </LI></UL></SPAN><H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Support for Scalable Application Design</H4><P CLASS="t">If an application created by an end user becomes popular and can be rolled out to the rest of the company, Trey Research wants its more experienced development teams to be able to further customize the application. This means that the company needs a solution that can meet the dual—and often conflicting—goals of enabling users to design applications and forms, and enabling the development staff to make those applications more robust, to integrate them with existing applications, or to add additional functionality. Microsoft Exchange Server was the only workgroup and messaging product evaluated by Trey Research that could provide a scalable application design environment. </P>
<P CLASS="t">After an application is rolled out, users inevitably find ways to improve it, and the competitive environment may require additional customizability. Because forms can be customized with Visual Basic, the desired functionality can be added to Microsoft Exchange Server workgroup solutions that use forms. And, because Visual Basic is a powerful programming language capable of calling any Windows-based API, there is virtually no limit to the functionality that can be added.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Integrating with Desktop Software</H4><P CLASS="t">Trey Research chose Microsoft Office largely because of the powerful programmability provided by Visual Basic for Applications and the various OLE Automation interfaces available in each Office application. Because Microsoft Exchange Server provides an OLE Automation server for MAPI that can be accessed from Microsoft Office applications and Visual Basic, integrating the company's applications with Microsoft Exchange Server will enable it to take advantage of its existing investment; build applications quickly; and add, customize, or change applications rapidly.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft Office applications can also be integrated into workgroup solutions offered by Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft Office documents and spreadsheets, for example, can be stored in the Microsoft Exchange Server information store, as well as shared between the Office applications and Microsoft Exchange Server. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Trey Research plans to use Microsoft Excel as a reporting mechanism for public folder applications. It will be used by the sales managers to automatically compile periodic contact and sales data. For example, a sales representative can enter information on new customers, outstanding customer issues, and sales closed. A sales manager can use the analysis and charting capabilities of Microsoft Excel to evaluate trends and track the business; and then automate the compiling, publication, and distribution of a report by using Microsoft Word and Microsoft Exchange Server.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Results</H4><P CLASS="t">By investing in a common technology, Trey Research provides key benefits for its users and developers. Sales managers, for example, are familiar with Microsoft Excel as a data-analysis tool. By integrating Microsoft Exchange Server applications into Microsoft Excel for additional analysis and data manipulation, Trey Research's managers don't have to learn a new tool or interface to conduct their analysis. </P></BODY></HTML>
