<H2 CLASS="h1">Application Extensibility</H2><P CLASS="t">As mentioned earlier, Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer permits end users to create forms for public folder and routing applications, without programming. It also enables software developers to customize an application further by generating Visual Basic source code for the form developed. For example, Forms Designer can generate the source code required to send a form through e-mail or to post a form in a folder. To customize forms even further, advanced programmers can use Visual Basic, Professional Edition.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Other workgroup application design tools either require a high degree of programming skill or become outdated whenever an application requires additional functionality. Microsoft Exchange Server bridges the gap between end-user application design and more powerful programming languages.</P></BODY></HTML>
