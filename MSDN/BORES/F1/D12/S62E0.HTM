<H3 CLASS="h2">Custom Recipients</H3><P CLASS="t">Custom recipients have a distinguished name that is of local significance only, therefore the distinguished name of a custom recipient is always ignored when routing the recipient through the GWART. The distinguished name and primary X.400 proxy O/R address of a custom recipient are contained in the P1 recipient address, but do not participate in routing. Instead, routing is accomplished through the Target Address attribute of the custom recipient.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Custom recipients have multiple proxy addresses of different types, but only one target address. The target address type typically matches the native mail system used to deliver mail to that custom recipient.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For routing purposes only, X.400 target addresses override the standard O/R address, and non-X.400 target addresses override the DDA portion of the O/R address. If the target address type is not X.400, it is used to route through the DDA arms of the GWART. The target address is not used to overwrite the original recipient address in the P1 of the message. If not originally specified, the target address will be created from the X.400 proxy address found by reading the distinguished name, as with mailboxes.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If no target address is found for the custom recipient, the primary X.400 proxy O/R address (if any) is used for routing.</P></BODY></HTML>
