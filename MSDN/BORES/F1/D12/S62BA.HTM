<H3 CLASS="h2">Network Quality and Connectivity</H3><P CLASS="t">If you place a Microsoft Exchange Server computer on a Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) ring with a 100-MB capacity, that server will provide better connectivity and performance than a server attached to a token-ring network. An overloaded Ethernet segment with many collisions occurring will also reduce the performance of the server. Wide area network (WAN) connectivity and quality should also be considered, especially if you are trying to determine site boundaries or whether to have clients access their server across the WAN.</P></BODY></HTML>
