<H1 CLASS="cht">Chapter 3 Optimizing Performance</H1><P CLASS="t">Your system's performance is also affected by the server's software and hardware configurations. You can minimize performance bottlenecks by balancing server hardware resources to support the expected load and adjusting software settings. This chapter suggests ways you can maximize the number of users supported while keeping response times low. Keep in mind that if you are supporting a live user population, you must be more cautious with the changes you make.</P>
