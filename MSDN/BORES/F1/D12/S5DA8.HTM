<H2 CLASS="h1">Moving Microsoft Exchange Server to Another Computer with the Same Hardware Platform</H2><P CLASS="t">The steps below describe how to move Microsoft Exchange Server to a new computer that has the same hardware platform as the original computer. For purposes of this example, the two computers will be referred to as the Original Server and the New Server, even though both computers have the same NetBIOS computer name.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To back up information from the Original Server</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program on the Original Server. Make note of the organization and site names. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">On the Original Server, stop all Microsoft Exchange Server services.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Copy the entire Exchsrvr directory to another computer on the network, or to a tape drive. If the Microsoft Exchange Server log and database directories are on different drives, use the Performance Optimizer or the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program to move all the directories to their corresponding locations under the Exchsrvr directory where Microsoft Exchange was installed. This should be done before backing up the Exchsrvr directory.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">If the KM Server is installed, stop the Key Management Server service and back up the Security directory. Back up the KM Server Service Startup disk as well.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Shut down the Original Server. As mentioned earlier, make sure that there is an operational domain controller in the Windows NT domain. </P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Installing Windows NT and Microsoft Exchange Server on the New Server</H3><P CLASS="t">Use the following procedure to install Windows NT and Microsoft Exchange Server on the New Server. Before you install Windows NT on the New Server, make sure that the Original Server has been turned off.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To install Windows NT and Microsoft Exchanger Server</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Install Windows NT on the New Server with the same computer name as the Original Server. If necessary, make it a BDC. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">On the New Server, at the command prompt, type <B>Setup /R </B>to install Microsoft Exchange Server. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Use the same organization and site names that were used on the Original Server. Also, make sure to install all connectors that were installed on the Original Server. To do so, select the <B>Custom</B> installation option. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">During setup, when prompted for the Microsoft Exchange service account, select the same service account that you used for the Original Server. This must be done because if a new service account is selected after the directory from the Original Server is restored over the New Server, the new service account will not have permissions on the directory.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Do not run the Performance Optimizer at the end of the Setup program. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Make sure that no Microsoft Exchange Server services are running.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Re-creating Data from the Original Microsoft Exchange Server on the New Server</H3><P CLASS="t">Use the following procedure to re-create data on the New Server.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To re-create data</P>
<P CLASS="ls">From the backed-up Exchsrvr directory on the Original Server, copy all the files over the Exchsrvr directory on the New Server.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1"><B>Note   </B>If the Original Server and the New Server do not have the same hardware platform, do <I>not</I> copy the contents of the entire Exchsrver directory over the New Server. If you do so, you will destroy your executable files. For more information on how to re-create data on a new server that does not have the same hardware platform, see the "Moving Microsoft Exchange Server to Another Computer with a Different Hardware Platform" section.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Start the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant and Microsoft Exchange Directory services.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">At the Windows NT command prompt, type the following to run the ISINTEG troubleshooting utility: </P>
<P CLASS="lt1"><B>ISINTEG -patch</B></P>
<P CLASS="ls">Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store service.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the Administrator window, select the New Server.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">From the <B>File </B>menu, choose <B>Properties</B>. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select the <B>Advanced</B> tab, select <B>All Inconsistencies</B>, and then choose <B>Adjust</B>.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Installing the KM Server</H3><P CLASS="t">Follow the procedure below to install the KM server:</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To install the KM server</P>
<P CLASS="ls">If you were using the KM server on the Original Server, install the KM server on the New Server. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select the option to create a startup disk. After the installation is completed, stop the Key Management Server service on the New Server.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">From the KM Server Startup disk for the Original Server, copy the Kmsp.ini file to another disk. Label this disk "KM Server Startup Disk: New Server."</P>
<P CLASS="ls">On the New Server, rename the \Mgrent subdirectory under the Security directory to Mgrent.original.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">From the backup of the Security directory on the Original Server, copy the Security\Mgrent directory to the Security directory of the New Server.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Insert the new KM Server Startup disk for the New Server (labeled "KM Server Startup Disk: New Server") into the disk drive on the New Server.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Start the Key Management Server service on the New Server.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Run the Performance Optimizer to make the appropriate changes.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Start all the Microsoft Exchange Server services.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Connectors</H3><P CLASS="t">Restore all Site Connector and X.400 Connector information on the New Server. Any Microsoft Mail, Internet Mail Service, or Dynamic RAS Connectors must be reconfigured. If you use third-party connectors, those also need to be reconfigured.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec4"></A>Microsoft Exchange Client Profiles</H3><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server should now be running on the New Server in the same way it was on the Original Server. Microsoft Exchange clients should be able to connect to the New Server in the same way as they connected to the Original Server. </P></BODY></HTML>
