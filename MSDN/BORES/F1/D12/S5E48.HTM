<H3 CLASS="h2">Developing Scalable Applications</H3><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server includes a scalable set of tools that enables almost anyone, even users who have never programmed, to develop custom groupware applications. It also enables professional programmers to build advanced business software systems. The following sections describe key Microsoft Exchange Server features that enable end users and programmers to create custom solutions.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Rapid Application Development Without Programming</H4><P CLASS="t">The Microsoft Exchange Server application design environment enables users to build complete groupware applications, such as customer-tracking systems or electronic discussion forums, without programming. Assuming they have the appropriate permissions, users can copy an existing application (including forms, views, permissions, and rules) and modify it as needed with the functionality available in Microsoft Exchange Client. They can easily modify existing forms or create new ones with Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer, which requires no programming knowledge.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Central Application Management</H4><P CLASS="t">After users complete an application, they will usually hand it off to an administrator for further testing or distribution to others within the organization. The Microsoft Exchange Server replication engine manages the distribution of the application or any new forms that may have been revised or created for existing applications. You can also replicate these applications from one Microsoft Exchange Server site to another over the Internet by using the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Both of these capabilities translate into reduced cycles for creating, modifying, and distributing groupware applications. This means that end users can build applications that are valuable to them without having to wait for a response from IS. The IS department can further customize these applications, because forms created or modified with Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer are extensible with the Visual Basic programming system. With the Microsoft Exchange Server replication engine, revisions and new applications can be deployed inexpensively as well.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In summary, the rapid application design and delivery process made possible by Microsoft Exchange Server enables those who have the best understanding of the functionality needed for specific applications to respond quickly to their organization's requirements. As a result, an organization can dramatically reduce the costs of adapting and rolling out those applications.</P></BODY></HTML>
