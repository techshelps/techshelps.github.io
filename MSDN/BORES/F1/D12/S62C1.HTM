<H3 CLASS="h2">Running the Performance Optimizer</H3><P CLASS="t">A server under load that exhibits poor response time will generally be bottlenecked on one or more of the three critical server hardware resources: CPU processing capacity, RAM, or the I/O subsystem. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Servers vary widely from low-end single processor, single-disk servers with small amounts of RAM to giant multiprocessor computers that rival the power of mainframes. Microsoft Exchange Server will run on all of them, but there are configuration settings that need to be adjusted to ensure that Microsoft Exchange Server is properly optimized for your specific server hardware.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Microsoft Exchange Performance Optimizer automatically detects your server's hardware and adjusts configuration settings that are hardware-dependent. If you have not run the Optimizer after installing Microsoft Exchange Server on your server hardware, it will most likely perform poorly. Any time you add or remove hardware to your Microsoft Exchange Server computer, you should rerun the Optimizer to ensure that Microsoft Exchange Server is properly tuned for your hardware. </P></BODY></HTML>
