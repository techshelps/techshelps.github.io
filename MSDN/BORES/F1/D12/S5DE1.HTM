<H3 CLASS="h2">Database Circular Logging</H3><P CLASS="t"><I>Database circular logging</I> uses transaction log technology but does not maintain previous transaction log files. Instead, a few log files are maintained and eventually purged as new log files are created. When transactions in transaction log files have been committed to the database, the existing log files are removed and previous transactions are discarded by this process. Circular logging is enabled by default. Although circular logging helps manage disk space and prevents the buildup of transaction log files, differential and incremental backups cannot be performed because these backups rely on past transaction log files.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When database circular logging is enabled, you may see multiple Edbxxxxx.log files in the Mdbdata or Dsadata directories. This is normal, because Microsoft Exchange Server uses several log files before setting the circular window (wrapping around). For example, the Edb00010.log, Edb00011.log, Edb00012.log, and Edb00013.log files would become Edb00011.log, Edb00012.l log, Edb00013.log, and Edb00014.log. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server attempts to maintain a window of four log files for circular logging. However, if the server I/O load is large, more than four log files will be used. Log files in excess of four will not be purged until the respective service (information store and/or directory service) is stopped and then restarted.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Verifying That Circular Logging Is Enabled</H4><P CLASS="t">To verify whether database circular logging settings are enabled, perform the following steps:</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, choose a server, and then select <B>Configuration</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">From the <B>File </B>menu, choose <B>Properties</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select the <B>Advanced</B> tab.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">View the circular logging settings.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Circular logging can be set separately for the information store and directory, and you can change these settings at any time by using the Administrator program. However, Microsoft Exchange Server will stop the corresponding service and restart it after making changes. </P></BODY></HTML>
