<H3 CLASS="h2">Chess Sample Application</H3><P CLASS="t">The Chess sample application shown in the figure below is a custom application written in Visual Basic. This application displays the moves that have been played in a chess game between two Microsoft Exchange Server users.</P>
<P CLASS="a"><img src="xerk_e06.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">The right side of the chess board displays the moves made so far. If you click one of the earlier moves, the chess pieces rearrange themselves to the positions they occupied at that point in the game. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This application demonstrates how <I>any</I> application can be created to view information in a Microsoft Exchange Server public folder or browse information in the public folder. And that application can act as the interface through which data is moved in and out of Microsoft Exchange Server, independent of the Microsoft Exchange Client. </P></BODY></HTML>
