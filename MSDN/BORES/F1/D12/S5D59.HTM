<H3 CLASS="h2">Procedure</H3><P CLASS="t">Because Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) is not fully deployed at this time, it cannot be used to deploy the Microsoft Exchange Client. However, there is a simple command you can run to complete an automated installation.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To complete an automated installation of Microsoft Exchange Client</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Because users cannot install this software on their local computers, you must log on to a workstation. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">After you log on to the workstation, run the <B>Instexch.bat</B> file. This batch file takes one argument—the name of the server where the installation directory resides (and from which Microsoft Exchange Client 4.0 will be installed). An example of a typical argument might be<B> instexch cisvr002</B>. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Note that the batch file uses drive X, so any previous connections made to this drive will be disconnected during the setup process. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This batch file will set up the necessary Microsoft Exchange Client software onto the workstation without any interaction from the Administrator.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Creating User Profiles</H4><P CLASS="t">Note that Microsoft Exchange Client 4.0 must already be installed on the client before you create the user profile. Also, you must run this process for every user who logs on to the workstation and wants to access his or her mail.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To create a user profile</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Log on to a workstation as the user. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Run the<B> Doprof.bat</B> file. This batch file takes one argument—the name of the server where the installation directory resides (and from which the Microsoft Exchange Client 4.0 will be installed). An example of a typical argument might be <B>doprof cisvr002</B>. </P>
<P CLASS="lt1">Note that the batch file uses drive X, so any previous connections made to this drive will be disconnected during the setup process. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This batch file will create a Microsoft Exchange Client profile for the currently logged-on user.</P>
