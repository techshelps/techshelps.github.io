<H3 CLASS="h2">The Personal Use Exemption</H3><P CLASS="t">On February 16, 1996, the U.S. government published an exemption for temporary export of cryptographic products for personal use. For the text of the regulations, see http://www.cdt.org/crypto/pers_exempt.html. </P>
<P CLASS="t">This exemption allows only U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to temporarily take abroad cryptographic products (such as encryption software installed on a laptop) for their personal use, without having to obtain an export license. The exemption imposes certain responsibilities on the traveler, including the following: </P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">You may carry only a single copy of each encryption software product and only one encryption hardware device, and use the software product (s) only on a simultaneously temporarily exported hardware product. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The encryption products are for your personal use and not for copying, demonstration, marketing, sale, re-export, or transfer of ownership or control, and you must keep the encryption products in your possession or the possession of another U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident traveling with you. A product is considered to be in your possession if you take normal precautions to ensure the security of the product by locking it in a hotel room, safe, or other comparably secure location.  In addition, while in transit, you keep the product in your carry-on luggage, or locked in baggage accompanying you that has been checked with the carrier. When you leave or return to the U.S., the encryption product(s) must be with your accompanying baggage or effects. They may not be exported or imported in unaccompanied baggage, mailed or transmitted by any other means (for example, electronically); and the encryption product(s) must be returned to the U.S. at the completion of your stay abroad. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">You may not carry the encryption products to destinations to which export is prohibited by a United Nations Security Council Resolution, or to which an export or export license would be prohibited by a U.S. statute, or to countries that have been determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism. The U.S. State Department informs us that at present prohibited destinations are Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, and the People's Republic of China. Actually prohibited destinations may change at any time, and you should verify the current prohibited destinations before you make use of the exemption. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Upon request of a U.S. Customs officer, you must agree to submit the cryptographic products for inspection. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">You must maintain for five years a record of each temporary export using the Self-Certification Form for Temporary Export of Encryption Software or its equivalent. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">In any instance where a product exported is stolen, lost, copied, sold, or otherwise compromised or transferred while abroad, you must report this incident within 10 days of your return to the U.S., to the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Control, Washington, D.C. 20520-0602. </LI></UL></SPAN></BODY></HTML>
