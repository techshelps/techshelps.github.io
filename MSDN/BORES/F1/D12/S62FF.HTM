<H3 CLASS="h2">Saving Directory Synchronization Configuration Information</H3><P CLASS="t">If you are using the Microsoft Mail Connector and have directory synchronization set up with Microsoft Mail postoffices, follow the steps below to save directory synchronization configuration information.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To save directory synchronization information</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">If Microsoft Exchange is the dirsync server, note the names of the dirsync server and each remote requester. Also note the Import and Export containers for each remote requester.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">If Microsoft Exchange is a dirsync requester, then note the exact name of the requester and the<B> Import</B>/<B>Export</B> containers.</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">This information must be available when recreating the directory synchronization objects on the new server. You need to re-create the dirsync server and requester exactly as they were defined on Server A to preserve DLs containing Microsoft Mail custom recipients that were previously dirsync'd into Microsoft Exchange Server. The custom recipients need to be re-created in the same container, with the same directory name and DN. This is only possible by importing the exported custom recipient data from the old server. By importing the custom recipient and DL information, you will retrieve all the old custom recipients and DLs.</P>
<P CLASS="t">However, if the dirsync requesters (or remote requesters) were not created with identical names, the Microsoft Mail custom recipients will not be associated with the new requesters. These custom recipients will never be deleted automatically as part of directory synchronization, even if the user has been deleted from the Microsoft Mail postoffice. To maintain the old directory synchronization information, the dirsync requester's server must have the same names, and must create new custom recipients in the same container.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You cannot just copy over the Exchsrvr directory from Server A to Server B, because the Microsoft Exchange directory file (Dir.edb) contains the name of the server. Because the computer names of the source (Server A) and target <BR>(Server B) computers are different, you cannot use the Dir.edb file from Server A on Server B. Due to this restriction, all information in the Microsoft Exchange directory must be re-created on Server B. </P></BODY></HTML>
