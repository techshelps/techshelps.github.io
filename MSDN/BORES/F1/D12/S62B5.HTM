<H3 CLASS="h2">Rules and Views</H3><P CLASS="t"><I>Rules</I> are user-defined actions that require a server to perform on behalf of the user. Typical examples of rules are: displaying a notification when a message is received from a specific person, or automatically moving messages into a specific folder based on the content of the message. Typically, rules have very little effect on overall server performance until most users have more than 10 rules set up.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For views, the server must store and keep track of the indexes that make up a view. Although a cache is used to store the most recently used indexes, a user might notice a small performance hit when opening a seldom-used view. </P></BODY></HTML>
