<H3 CLASS="h2">Moving Mailboxes to the New Server</H3><P CLASS="t">This section describes how to move all the mailboxes on Server A to Server B. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B>   You can move mailboxes to another server in a site by choosing <B>Move Mailbox</B> from the <B>Tools</B> menu in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program. However, this only enables you to move the mailboxes to the Recipients container. If this is acceptable, then using the <B>Move Mailbox</B> command is the easiest way to move mailboxes.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To keep the mailboxes in the same containers or subcontainers as they were on Server A</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Stop the Information Store service on Server B. In Control Panel, double-click the <B>Services</B> icon. Under the <B>Service</B> list, select <B>Microsoft Exchange Information Store,</B> and then choose <B>Stop</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the Exchsrvr\Mdbdata directory on Server B, create a subdirectory called Bak.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Move all files from the Exchsrvr\Mbddata directory in Server B to the Bak directory.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Copy the Pub.edb file from the Bak directory to the Mbddata directory.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">Before proceeding to the next step, make sure that you completed a backup of the Exchsrvr directory on Server A. This backup should be completed after all services are stopped. Also, verify that you have successfully created the Mailbox-ServerB.csv file.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Start all of the Microsoft Exchange services on Server A.</P></BODY></HTML>
