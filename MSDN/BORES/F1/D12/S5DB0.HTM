<H2 CLASS="h1">Performance Tuning Microsoft Exchange Server</H2><P CLASS="t">To performance tune Microsoft Exchange Server, you need to define how your system is used. There are different configuration recommendations depending on the role of your server. For example, does your server support user mailboxes? Or does it serve as a messaging hub or mail gateway?</P>
<P CLASS="t">It is always a good idea to try to understand the workload being placed on the system by asking this question: What are your users doing? To gather user profile information, you can use the StorStat tool, which is available in the Exchange directory on the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit, Part Two compact disc. This tool can help greatly by providing you with sizing information.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Ultimately, you must examine the behavior of the system while it is in operation. You can do so by using the Windows NT Performance Monitor (PerfMon) tool. For more information on this tool, see the Windows NT Resource Kit. Performance Monitor enables you to observe important factors that affect the server's behavior, such as <I>workloads</I> (How many messages per second are arriving?) and <I>resource demands</I> (How much CPU time is being used? How much memory?). The information is presented as performance counters, which you can monitor in real time or collect in .log files for later analysis. When you examine the demand on resources, you can generally see what needs to be done to improve response times or throughputs.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can use the Microsoft Exchange Server Load Simulator (Loadsim.exe) to conduct system sizing experiments prior to deployment. Load Simulator emulates a large number of client computers and places a very realistic load on the server so that you can see how it behaves and what response times to expect. Although this section does not describe the Load Simulator tool in detail, if you are conducting a Load Simulator experiment, the information provided here will help you.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Run the Performance Optimizer (PerfWiz) after you install Microsoft Exchange Server and any time you make configuration changes on the server. The Performance Optimizer is available on the Microsoft Exchange Server compact disc. The Performance Optimizer optimally adjusts a number of system settings for any hardware in the server. </P></BODY></HTML>
