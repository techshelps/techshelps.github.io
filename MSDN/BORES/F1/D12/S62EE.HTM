<H3 CLASS="h2">Installing Microsoft Exchange on the New Server (Server B)</H3><P CLASS="t">Make sure that Server B is in the same Windows NT domain as Server A , or in a domain that has full trust with the domain containing Server A.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note   </B>If you are running Microsoft Exchange Server, Standard Edition without the Microsoft Exchange Connector, follow the steps in the section on moving Microsoft Exchange Server, Standard Edition (later in this chapter), instead of the steps in this section.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">If Server A is a primary domain controller (PDC) and you do not plan to leave it running after moving Microsoft Exchange Server, install Windows NT on Server B and make Server B a backup domain controller (BDC) in the same Windows NT domain as Server A.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Install Microsoft Exchange on Server B, joining the Microsoft Exchange site<I> </I>of Server A. Install all the connectors that were installed on Server A.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">If you are running Microsoft Exchange Server, Standard Edition on Server A, you must install the Microsoft Exchange Connector on Server A before attempting to add Server B to the existing site.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Upgrade Server B to the same Microsoft Exchange Service Pack as Server A.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">All users on Server A should appear in the global address list (GAL) for <BR>Server B.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the Administrator window, double-click Server B, and then select the Public Information Store.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Choose <B>Properties</B> from the <B>File </B>menu, and then select the<B> Instances</B> tab (this tab is not included in Microsoft Exchange Server, Standard Edition). All of the public folders on Server A should appear. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Under the <B>Public folders</B> list, select all folders, and then choose <B>Add </B>to add all the public folders to the local information store on Server B. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">By default, the first server in a site will contain and be responsible for the site folders. Site folders consist of the offline Address Book folder, the Microsoft Schedule+ Free/Busy Information folder, and the Organizational Forms folder, if one exists. Other servers installed in the site rely, by default, on the first server for this information. Therefore, if Server A was the first server to be installed in the site, make sure that you have added instances of the Organization Forms, Schedule+ Free/Busy Information, and offline Address Bookfolders to the public information store on Server B.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">This step ensures that all folders in the site are replicated to Server B. After all steps for moving Server A to Server B are completed, individual public folders can be removed from the public information store on Server B if there are other replicas of these folders on other servers in the same Microsoft Exchange Server site.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the Administrator window, choose a server, and then choose a site.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select <B>Public Information Store</B>, then select <B>Public Folder Resources</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Change the <B>Public Folder Server</B> setting to Server B.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the Administrator window, choose <B>Configuration</B>. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Double-click<B> DS Site Configuration</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select the <B>Offline Address Book</B> tab.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Under the <B>Offline Address Book server</B> list, select Server B.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the Administrator window, choose <B>Configuration</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Double-click <B>Site Addressing</B>. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select the <B>General</B> tab.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Under the <B>Routing calculation server</B> list, select Server B.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Note that the <B>Apply</B> button is not enabled when you select Server B from the <B>Routing calculation server</B> list. To enable this button and ensure that the change to the routing calculation server setting is recorded, in the <B>Display Name</B> box, add and then remove a character. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">For each DL defined, select the Distribution List tab and verify that the expansion server is not set to Server A.</P></BODY></HTML>
