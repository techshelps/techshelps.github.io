These associations are defined by using the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, and are subsequently used to generate the Gateway Routing Table (GWART). An enterprise-wide GWART is created in each site by the Routing Information Daemon (RID), which accesses local information and replicated site GWARTs to build a consolidated local GWART.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A mail message can be either a P1 message, probe, or report. Each responsible recipient of a message is routed individually. Before routing a recipient, the MTA obtains as much address information for the recipient as possible. For more information, see the "Name Resolution" section. If the recipient is local to the current MTA's address space, local routing takes place. If not, remote routing takes place. This process involves routing (through the GWART), selection, and load balancing for each recipient to obtain the routing destination. </P></BODY></HTML>
