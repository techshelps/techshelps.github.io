<H3 CLASS="h2">Perform a Periodic Fire Drill </H3><P CLASS="t">A periodic fire drill is an effective way to measure your ability to recover from a disaster and to certify your disaster recovery plans. Conduct this in a test environment and attempt a complete recovery. Make sure to use data from production backups. During this process, record the time it takes to recover. This information will assist you in estimating the time it will take to recover in a real disaster recovery situation. From personal experience, up to one-third of recovery time can be spent in preparing and getting the correct tools in place to complete the job. For maximum effect, provide no notice to your staff that you are performing a drill. This will be the most valuable experience you will have in your disaster recovery planning.</P></BODY></HTML>
