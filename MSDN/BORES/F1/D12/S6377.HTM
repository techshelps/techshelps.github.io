<H2 CLASS="h1">Windows AT Command Scheduler and the Windows NT Schedule Service</H2><P CLASS="t">When you use the Windows AT Command Scheduler, the Windows NT Schedule service runs all jobs that have been scheduled. Because batch jobs are run in the context of the Schedule service, Windows NT security must be considered. When configuring the Schedule service, configure the account to be a member of the Windows NT Backup Operators group. This enables a full backup of the information store and directory.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following figure shows the Windows AT Command Scheduler.</P>

<P CLASS="t">Make sure that the Back.bat jobs are set for interactive. This is required by the Ntbackup.exe program.</P></BODY></HTML>
