<H3 CLASS="h2">Microsoft Exchange Client Profiles</H3><P CLASS="t">Make sure that both Server A and Server B are running. Server A should be kept running until every client has logged on at least once. This ensures that the Microsoft Exchange Client profiles are automatically redirected to Server B instead of Server A, thus eliminating the need to manually modify client profiles. </P>
<P CLASS="t">After all clients have logged on to Microsoft Exchange Server at least once, use the steps below to remove Server A from the organization. If Server A is removed before all clients have logged on, the profile on the clients will need to be modified to point to Server B.</P></BODY></HTML>
