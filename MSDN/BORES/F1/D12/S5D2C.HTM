<H3 CLASS="h2">Server Load</H3><P CLASS="t">A server computer consists of the following three hardware elements: one or more CPUs of a given architecture and processing speed, an amount of primary memory (RAM), and one or more disk drives of specific speeds and sizes and their controllers. These hardware elements comprise the critical hardware resources on the server. </P>
<P CLASS="t">When Microsoft Exchange Server services a user-initiated action or performs background actions, it uses each of these resources to some degree over a period of time to perform its operations. For example, responding to an open message request from a client can require several milliseconds of CPU processing time, one or more disk accesses, and enough memory to hold the code and data necessary to perform the operation. In the case where actions occur over a period of time, all of the server hardware is dedicated to each action. Each action is completed as quickly as possible and does not need to wait for hardware resources to become available. In such cases, the Microsoft Exchange Server computer is essentially idle between each action, and the actions are separated sufficiently in time so that they do not overlap. In other words, the server is <I>unloaded</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">On the other hand, when many users are initiating actions close together in time or a large number of background events are occurring, there is competition for the server hardware resources. Bottlenecks occur when the code servicing a particular action must wait for hardware to become available to complete its tasks. When this happens, the server is said to be <I>under load</I>.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Load and Response Time</H4><P CLASS="t">When a server is under load, actions can take longer to complete than they would if the server were unloaded. For user-initiated actions, this can increase response time. If the server is excessively loaded, users can perceive the server as slow or unresponsive. Imagine a server with specific hardware and a homogenous user community where each user performs the same set of actions randomly but, on average, evenly spaced over a given time interval. With only a single user connected to the server, each user-initiated action is completed before the next is initiated. The response times that user experiences are near the theoretical minimums allowed by the hardware in use on the client and server computers and the underlying network.</P>
<P CLASS="t">However, if you allow more users to connect to the server, actions overlap in time. Microsoft Exchange Server becomes bottlenecked for short durations while one portion of the software performing an action waits for another to relinquish hardware resources. Eventually, this delays actions to the point that user-initiated actions are taking noticeably longer to complete.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This relationship between load and response time defines the number of users any given server can support. At some point, as the load on a server increases, the response times a user experiences move from being acceptable to being unacceptable. This crossover point defines the number of the theoretical, homogenous users that a server's hardware can support. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>An Average Workday's Effect on the Server</H4><P CLASS="t">Actions that cause load are not evenly distributed over time. The morning hours of the workday can exhibit the highest load, when users arrive at work and spend time catching up on e-mail or public folder information that has been generated since the previous day. Conversely, lunch time can represent a lull in the day's activity, as well as evenings and weekends.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Given the number of users Microsoft Exchange Server can typically host, even on smaller server computers, the impulse loads should not represent a large percentage of the total user population on the server except in extreme situations.</P></BODY></HTML>
