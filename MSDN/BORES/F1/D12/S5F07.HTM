<H3 CLASS="h2">Using Mailbox Statistics</H3><P CLASS="t">When you use Mailbox Statistics, you set up an administrator's mailbox for collecting results and send the tool to your users to run it against their sets of personal folders. When users submit a number of results, you can run the tool in administrator mode and export results to a variety of output formats. Before you send the tool to your users, you can test it with a small subset of about 10 people to ensure the tool works as expected and to become familiar with the different kinds of results.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note   </B>Mailbox Statistics can detect only Microsoft Exchange Server distribution lists (DLs). </P>
<P CLASS="t">If the <B>Save Items to Sent Mail</B> option is not selected in a user's Microsoft Exchange setup, then Mailbox Statistics cannot determine the number of messages sent per day. You can ask the test group to select this option for at least seven days before the study to collect enough information to use.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To use Mailbox Statistics:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Set up an administrator's mailbox that will be used to receive the data</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Send a message with Storstat.exe attached to the users to be surveyed. Those users double-click an icon in the message to run it. 
<P CLASS="lt1"><B>Note   </B>Storstat.exe is supported only for users on Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation.</P></LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="proch">To set up the administrator's mailbox</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Using the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, create a mailbox with the display name StorStat. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Set permissions on this mailbox according to your organization's procedures, so that the Microsoft Exchange Server administrator's account has user permission on this mailbox.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Results appear as MAPI messages with the subject "UserName UserResults." You can use the Inbox Assistant to forward or copy results to another folder.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To send mailbox statistics to users</P>
<P CLASS="ls">From the Microsoft Exchange Client <B>Compose</B> menu, choose <B>New Message</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the message body, type instructions for your users.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">From the <B>Insert</B> menu, choose <B>File</B>, and then attach StorStat.exe to the message.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">It appears as an icon in the message. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Users can be concerned about using the tool if they believe it will alter, damage, copy, or intrude in any way on their sets of personal folders. For this reason, you can include information to reassure them that no information is read or copied, no damage is inflicted on their data, and no changes are made to their data when this tool is running.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>How a User Works with Mailbox Statistics</H4><P CLASS="t">The user opens the message and starts a copy of the tool, which opens the <B>Message Stores Statistics Analyzer</B> dialog box listing all the user's personal folders. At least one message store must be selected before analysis can be started. </P>
<P CLASS="t">By default, all personal folders are selected. The user can choose <B>Clear All</B> to cancel the selection and then select specific folders to analyze, or choose <B>Select All</B> to select all the personal folders. If the user chooses <B>Exit</B>, no analysis is performed.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When the user chooses <B>Start Analyzing</B>, the tool opens and analyzes every personal folder file owned by that user. The tool then generates statistics, including the number of folders, the number of rules, and the amount of e-mail per day in each folder. A progress bar and the folder names are displayed as messages are processed. </P>
<P CLASS="t">When the Mailbox Statistics tool finishes analyzing the folders, it displays the following message: "Results have been automatically sent to your administrator. Thank you for your cooperation." Optionally, the user can also save the results. When the user deletes the announcement message, StorStat.exe is also deleted. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Running Mailbox Statistics in Administrator Mode</H4><P CLASS="t">This procedure assumes that an administrator's mailbox (named StorStat) has been created and is available to collect results from users. You can check on the number of responses by opening the Inbox and viewing the number of messages containing "UserResults." When enough responses have been gathered, you can tabulate them by running the Mailbox Statistics tool in administrator mode.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you have results generated by an earlier version of the tool, store them separately from later results. With the results separated, you should receive no error messages caused by using the tool on mixed-version generated results.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you want to use the macro included with Mailbox Statistics, save your results in the Microsoft Excel .csv file format.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To run Mailbox Statistics in Administrator mode</P>
<P CLASS="ls">At the command prompt, type: </P>
<P CLASS="lt1"><B>storstat.exe -a</B></P>
<P CLASS="ls">Set the default messaging profile to the Mailbox Statistics administrator's mailbox, or select the profile.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">You'll see a progress bar move as messages are processed. When all messages are processed, the <B>Summary Results</B> dialog box appears.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Choose <B>Save As</B> to save results in a location under a file name you specify, or choose <B>Exit</B> to disregard these results.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Exporting results</H5><P CLASS="t">When the Mailbox Statistics tool completes its analysis of each set of personal folders, it sends a message to the administrator's mailbox you set up for collecting the results. When you run the tool in administrator mode, you can save your results as many times as you want, using different file types.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To export your results</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Run Mailbox Statistics in administrator mode. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the <B>Save As</B> dialog box, select a file type for your results. </P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Interpreting results</H5><P CLASS="t">Remember that the Mailbox Statistics tool works with available data. For example, if a few users empty the Deleted Items folder when quitting Microsoft Exchange, and others do not, you can see wide differences between the statistics calculated from the Deleted Items folder. Moreover, Forward and Reply may not be computed as expected with localized Microsoft Exchange clients because the logic looks for RE: and FW: characters.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The first time you review the results, use the following example to become familiar with the local source of each statistic.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Sample Mailbox Statistics results</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">The following two sections list captions that precede each statistic the Mailbox Statistics tool displays. The first illustrates statistics from a single set of personal folders. The second illustrates statistics from combined sets of personal folders collected in an administrator's mailbox.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the caption is self-explanatory, no note is included. If a note is included, it follows the caption and is enclosed in brackets. Notes either define terms or clarify logic.</P>

<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec4"></A>Questions and Answers</H4><P CLASS="t">The following are common questions and answers about the Mailbox Statistics tool:</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Q:    Why haven't I received any results in the administrator's mailbox?</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">A:    Check the installation of the Mailbox Statistics tool, including these verifications:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI2">The administrator's mailbox name is correct.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI2">Instructions and StorStat.exe were received by the users.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI2">At least one user successfully completed the survey.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI2">Microsoft Exchange Server is transferring e-mail successfully.</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="ls">Q:    Why didn't we receive all the results?</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">A:    Each user can decide whether to run Mailbox Statistics. Some time may lapse before all the results are sent, especially if you gave no deadline, or if some users are away from the office. If the number of results is low, verify that all users received the instructions and the Mailbox Statistics tool, and then send a reminder to run the survey.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Q:    Why can't Windows for Workgroups or Windows 3.1<I>x</I> users run the tool?</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">A:    Mailbox Statistics is a 32-bit tool. It can be used only with Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation operating systems.</P></BODY></HTML>
