<H3 CLASS="h2">Create and Verify Daily Backups</H3><P CLASS="t">This is a critical step in disaster recovery. It sounds simple, but you can only recover data if you have a valid backup. Failure to verify backups is one of the most common mistakes made. It is often assumed that backup tapes are being swapped and that data is being properly backed up. It should be a daily routine to review all backup logs and follow up on any errors or inconsistencies. Furthermore, full (normal) backups reset and remove transaction logs. This results in free disk space. Note that this is less of an issue if circular logging is enabled. If circular logging is not enabled and daily full backups are failing, transaction logs will not be purged and you can fill up the entire transaction log disk drive. </P></BODY></HTML>
