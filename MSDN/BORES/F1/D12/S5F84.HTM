<H2 CLASS="h1">Replver Tool</H2><P CLASS="t">The Replver tool is a reporting tool that provides a way to verify whether replication of both the public folder hierarchy and content occurred reliably across sites and throughout the organization. This tool runs against a <I>master server</I>, which verifies that a folder's contents on replicated servers are in sync with all replicated servers. The master server is the server that compares the public folder hierarchy and content of the other specified servers. The Replver tool verifies folder content, message content, MAPI properties between the master server and all replicated servers. When the tool finds an error, a message is displayed in the log file for verification and action.</P></BODY></HTML>
