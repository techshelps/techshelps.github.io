<H2 CLASS="h1">Self-Certification Form</H2><P CLASS="t">The North American version of the Microsoft Exchange Client contains strong encryption software and is subject, therefore, to export restrictions under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) of the United States State Department.  The State Department recently published an amendment to these regulations authorizing the temporary export of cryptographic products for use by U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents when traveling abroad. This topic summarizes the conditions for taking advantage of the Personal Use Exemption and provides a sample form that qualified customers can use to comply with the State Department's record-keeping and self-certification requirements.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Please note that this document is provided for the convenience of Microsoft customers only. No warranty is made as to its accuracy, completeness, timeliness or suitability for any particular purpose. If you are uncertain whether you qualify for the Personal Use Exemption, or if you have any questions about its application to your particular circumstances, please contact the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls, (703) 875-6643 or FAX (703) 875-6647, or consult with legal counsel.   </P>
