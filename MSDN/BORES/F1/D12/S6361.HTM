<H3 CLASS="h2">Publish a Microsoft Exchange Server Maintenance Schedule</H3><P CLASS="t">Perform basic preventive maintenance on a regular basis. The robustness of Microsoft Exchange Server can be compromised by failure to perform basic preventive maintenance routines when deploying servers. A Microsoft Exchange Server computer is no different than a car that requires oil changes and other maintenance. Unlike mainframes, servers are often overlooked when it comes to scheduling downtime for maintenance. It is a simple formula: Planned maintenance generally reduces unplanned downtime. It is important to set user expectation levels by publishing a maintenance schedule especially when users expect service 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Maintenance is inevitable because the nature of the data processing business includes service pack updates, software upgrades, and hardware upgrades. Although rare, it might be necessary to take down the information store service to reduce the size of store files by using the EDBUTIL troubleshooting utility. This utility is available on the Microsoft Exchange Server compact disc.</P></BODY></HTML>
