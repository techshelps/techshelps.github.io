<H1 CLASS="cht">Chapter 4 MS Exchange Server Disaster Recovery</H1><P CLASS="t">This chapter describes techniques that can be used for Microsoft Exchange Server disaster recovery planning. For quick answers to many frequently asked questions, see the "Disaster Recovery Frequently Asked Questions" section. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Before reading this chapter, read Chapter 15 of the <I>Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide</I>. Although Microsoft Exchange Server is a robust and stable messaging platform, it is essential that you have a working plan to restore Microsoft Exchange Server computers and data in a timely way if a system crash or another disaster occurs. By reading this chapter, you can minimize downtime for your organization and provide the quickest possible data recovery. However, it is important that you do not take this information for granted. Instead, test, formulate, and certify your own disaster recovery plans.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Because Microsoft Exchange uses Windows NT&reg; security for authentication, you must also consider Windows NT operating system backup and restoration procedures, as well as procedures for Microsoft Exchange Server backup and restoration. Due to this relationship, Microsoft Exchange Server disaster recovery cannot be considered independently from Windows NT disaster recovery.</P>
<P CLASS="t">An enhanced version of the Windows NT Ntbackup.exe program is available on the Microsoft Exchange Server compact disc. One of the benefits of Microsoft Exchange Server and the new Ntbackup.exe program is that they provide live backup of the Microsoft Exchange information store and directory without causing interruption to the messaging system. Ntbackup.exe also provides file-based backup services that back up the Windows NT registry.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following figure shows the updated Ntbackup.exe program with Microsoft Exchange Server extensions.</P>

<P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server does not need to be taken offline to perform backup. The entire information store, directory, message transfer agent (MTA), and system attendant remain in service during online backup. Although the information store and directory can be backed up online, files in directories being accessed by other Microsoft Exchange Server for Windows NT services, such as the DX or PCMTA services [Microsoft Mail Connector (Appletalk) MTA], should be backed up when the respective service is not running. You can automate and schedule this backup by using the Winat.exe graphical user interface (GUI) scheduler. For more information, see the <I>Windows NT Resource Kit</I>. An example of a batch file that shuts down and restarts Microsoft Exchange Server services is also discussed in this chapter. This batch file can be used for other purposes as well.</P></BODY></HTML>
