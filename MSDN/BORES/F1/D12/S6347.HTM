<H3 CLASS="h2">Single-Instance Storage with Per-User Storage Limits</H3><P CLASS="t">With Microsoft Exchange Server, you are given control of storage. Research shows that one of the most common reasons for mail system outages is the inability to limit user storage, which eventually causes servers to fill up and cease working. Therefore, within its shared mail information store, Microsoft Exchange Server enables administrators to set and enforce disk quotas, either as an overall default, or as individual user limits. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Users can be given a warning limit as well as a fixed limit. The fixed limit is enforced by prohibiting the offending user from sending any new e-mail until the user cleans up his or her mailbox. In this way, this user will not miss any critical incoming e-mail messages, and other users won't receive non-delivery notices from the offending user's mailbox.</P></BODY></HTML>
