<H3 CLASS="h2">Microsoft Exchange Factors Affecting Usage</H3><P CLASS="t">When determining the number of users to allow on a Microsoft Exchange Server computer, consider how many users will be connected simultaneously. You might be able to put more user accounts on one server if you know that not all of them will be connected at the same time. For example, if your organization has two shifts of workers, where both sets of users won't be connected to the server at the same time, then more user accounts can be hosted on the same server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Although a background cost exists when you have more users on a server than are actually connected, it isn't nearly as high as the cost of having more simultaneously connected users. </P>
<P CLASS="t">In summary, the most important comparison to consider is that of background tasks versus user-initiated tasks. Even when a user is not connected, directories will be updated, rules triggered, messages delivered, and other operations will take place on an ongoing basis.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Location and Use of Stores</H4><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange enables users to store messages in the server-based store or in personal folder (.pst) files on their local computers or on a network drive. Even if a user has personal folders, he or she will also still have a server-based store. In fact, it is not possible for a user to only have personal folder files. The server-based store must exist to receive messages, process rules, and so on. However, if users set their personal folder files as the default delivery location, a lot of work is offloaded from the server. Messages are delivered to the user's server store and rules are triggered on behalf of that user, but these rules can be deferred until the user logs on, if it involves working with the user's .pst file.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Whenever a user requests data from a personal folder, the server does not read the attributes and data into the buffer cache. Instead, all of the processing occurs on the client, because that is where the data is located. In this case, the server does not have to be involved at all. If a user saves a copy of everything in the Sent Mail folder, that process is performed locally. Also, when a user deletes a message, a copy is saved in the local Deleted Items folder and again, the server is not involved. </P></BODY></HTML>
