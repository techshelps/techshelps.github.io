<H3 CLASS="h2">Installing the Administrative Mailbox Agent</H3><P CLASS="t">The Administrative Mailbox Agent is installed through a simple graphical setup program similar to that of a Microsoft Windows setup program. </P>
<P CLASS="proch">To install the Administrative Mailbox Agent</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the Exchange\&lt;<I>operating system</I>\<I>platform</I>&gt;\Admin\AdminAgt directory on the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit, Part Two compact disc, double-click Setup.exe.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select the Windows NT Server computer that you want to install the service on. Your current server computer is the default server. After you select the server, the installation program replicates the sites in your Microsoft Exchange organization.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select the Microsoft Exchange site where you want to install the Administrative Mailbox Agent. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">You will be prompted to select the Microsoft Exchange directory container you want to use for the Agent. Select the top-level Recipients container. This opens the <B>Install</B> dialog box. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the <B>Install</B> dialog box, type or select the directory display name that the user and administrator will see in their Microsoft Exchange Client and the Microsoft Exchange administrator program that you want to send mail to or configure properties for. The recommended name is "Admin Agent."</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select the Windows NT service name that you want to appear in the list of services running on your server. (You can view this list by double-clicking <B>Services</B> in Control Panel.) You can use the same name as the directory display name (Admin Agent).</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select the service account you want to use. You can use the Administrator account or create a special service account with full Windows NT and Microsoft Exchange permissions. Note that this account must have Administrator permissions for the Microsoft Exchange Administrative Mailbox Agent and for Windows NT. If you want to create Window NT accounts on another domain, the other domain must contain these accounts as well, and must have the same password.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Type the service password that corresponds to the service account.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select the directory where you want to install the Administrative Mailbox Agent. Although you'll need to select a directory on a drive with at least 1 MB of free space, note that the Administrative Agent takes very little space (less than 500K).</P>
<P CLASS="ls">After the Administrative Mailbox Agent is installed in the specified directory, you can start the service by using the Control Panel, or by typing <B>Admin Agent</B> at the command prompt. After the Agent starts, it is ready to respond to e-mail requesting the creation or deletion of accounts.</P></BODY></HTML>
