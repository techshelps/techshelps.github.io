<H2 CLASS="h1">Building a Range of Solutions on a Single Platform</H2><P CLASS="t">Most organizations need a wide range of business applications to improve processes and respond to competitive opportunities. In many organizations, this results in a heterogeneous collection of operating systems, e-mail systems, security platforms, and user directories, and the corresponding overhead of supporting those systems, training users on a variety of interfaces, and hiring a development staff versed in a wide array of technologies. </P>
<P CLASS="t">By providing an extensible messaging platform upon which users can access and build messaging and groupware, Microsoft Exchange Server eliminates the need for duplicating security systems, user directories, client interfaces, systems management interfaces, and development technologies that often accompany process-automation solutions. Microsoft Exchange Server doesn't require its own security system; it simply uses that of the operating system. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Because Microsoft Exchange Server is built on MAPI, custom-application developers and third-party software developers can write to a powerful, widely accepted programming interface to provide customers with a wide selection of groupware applications. By bringing these components under the control of a single messaging-based platform, organizations can focus their resources on creating customized applications, rather than on managing the complexities of multiple and often incompatible systems for each type of messaging or workgroup application.</P></BODY></HTML>
