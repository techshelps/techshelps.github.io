<H3 CLASS="h2">Local Recipients (Mailboxes)</H3><P CLASS="t">A recipient is considered to be<I> local</I><B> </B>and is not routed through the GWART if a distinguished name for the recipient is available that matches the local site, and the distinguished name does not identify a custom recipient. If a recipient has only an O/R address that matches the local site O/R address space, then a distinguished name will be found by proxy search if the recipient is a valid local recipient. If no distinguished name is found, the recipient will be routed through the GWART.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Address space filtering is performed in the GWART routing routine to ensure that O/R addresses matching the local site O/R address space are not sent out of the site. If a recipient is to be routed through the GWART and matches the local O/R address space, this recipient is marked for non-delivery receipt (NDR). This option can be disabled if you use the Administrator program <B>Share address space with other local systems</B> option. To do so, in the Administrator window, choose a recipient, and then select the <B>General</B> tab. Choose <B>Configuration</B>, and then select <B>Site Addressing</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If a local recipient originally had a distinguished name, and an O/R address is found by a proxy search, no re-encode of the P1 recipient address is performed because the O/R address is not required when routing locally. The exception to this is if Recipient_Disclosure is allowed, the O/R address must be included to prevent interoperability problems.</P></BODY></HTML>
