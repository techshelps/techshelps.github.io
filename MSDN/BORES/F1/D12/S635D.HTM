<H3 CLASS="h2">Review the Environment When Placing Production Servers</H3><P CLASS="t">Inspect the area when deploying servers. Make sure that the environment is receptive. For example, you should ensure that there is enough power, and if possible, dedicate power lines for your equipment. Review existing amperage and new amperage requirements. Make sure that servers are not placed under fire sprinklers. Also, make sure that your servers are in a physically secure location and that the room temperature is acceptable. </P></BODY></HTML>
