<H3 CLASS="h2">Name Resolution</H3><P CLASS="t">The recipient address (or O/R Name) consists of either the distinguished name (DN) or the X.400 O/R address, or both. The X.400 O/R address is logically divided into standard X.400 O/R address attributes and domain-defined attributes (DDAs). A <I>one-off routing address</I> is a manually entered O/R address that is not held in the directory and therefore has no DN. A valid X.400 O/R address is required for routing out of the site, even if only a DDA is specified in a one-off routing address. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Following is the name resolution process:</P>
<P CLASS="ls">If the recipient address contains no DN, verify whether a DN has been saved within the DDA fields (in an earlier pass through an MTA that constructed an O/R address), and use that if it exists.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">If a DN exists, read the O/R address for that DN.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Perform basic checking on any O/R address.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">If the original DN was invalid or no DN exists, scan the local proxy addresses to find a match with the O/R address, and then obtain the DN. If the initial scan fails, but a common name or surname exists, perform a "fuzzy match" scan for a unique matching DN.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">If the current O/R address is invalid, add the local global domain identifier (GDI) to make it valid.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When new address information for a recipient is found, the P1 recipient address is re-encoded into the message. After a message has been routed through the GWART, further name resolution may be required (for more information, see the "Remote Mailboxes" section).</P></BODY></HTML>
