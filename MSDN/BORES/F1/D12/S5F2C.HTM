<H2 CLASS="h1">MAPIsend Tool</H2><P CLASS="t">The MAPIsend tool (Mapisend.exe) is used to send messages with optional file attachments through Microsoft Exchange Server from a Windows NT Workstation or Windows 95 command prompt.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note   </B>The MAPIsend tool (Mapisend.exe) was formerly known as the Command-Line Mail Sender Tool (Sendmail.exe). This program is also available in the Microsoft Mail Resource Kit.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Computers running Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server unattended can better communicate their status proactively, rather than constantly being polled by remote performance monitors or operations staff using Windows NT Server administration tools. The MAPIsend tool was developed to enable the following tasks to be reported to an operations group using standard Microsoft Exchange Server messages:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Performance Monitor alerts</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Tape backup job status</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Disk quota information (using Diruse)</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange administrators can run this program automatically, by using the AT Scheduler in Windows NT or the Winat.exe program included in the Windows NT Resource Kit. This section explains how to send mail by using Mapisend.exe with the AT scheduler.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Programs scheduled with the Windows NT AT scheduler are run by the Windows&nbsp;NT Schedule service. To send mail to a Microsoft Exchange mailbox with the Mapisend.exe program, you must use a domain account to start the Schedule service. By default, the service starts by using the LocalSystem account.</P></BODY></HTML>
