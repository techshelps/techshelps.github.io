<H3 CLASS="h2">Testing Methodology </H3><P CLASS="t">To testing your methodology when determining the number of users supported by a server, you should follow the four steps below:</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Optimize your server. Optimization includes optimizing the hardware and Microsoft Exchange Server Setup. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Classify your users and set expectations as to what acceptable response times they will need. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">Calculate your user data and use the Load Simulator tool.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Analyze your data.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Step One: Optimizing Your Server</H4><P CLASS="t">This section describes how to configure the hardware you are using with Microsoft Exchange Server. </P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Configuring Your CPU</H5><P CLASS="t">There is not a lot you can do to optimize your CPU. However, it is important to note that Microsoft Exchange Server does not scale well past four CPUs. For example, a Windows NT&reg; Server computer dedicated to a Microsoft Exchange Server organization with more than four CPUs does not provide a boost in performance. Those CPUs could be put to better use elsewhere. As far as the type of CPU is concerned, the faster the better. Therefore, using a Pentium 133 chip provides much more performance than a 486/66 and a little more performance than a Pentium 100.</P>
<P CLASS="t">There is one optimization step you can take with Windows NT Server that improves how your server uses its CPUs. </P>
<P CLASS="proch">To optimize how your server uses its CPUs</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In Control Panel, double-click the <B>System</B> icon.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Choose the <B>Performance</B> tab.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Under application performance, boost the slider bar to halfway between <B>None</B> and <B>Maximum</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This boosts the system priorities that Windows NT Server places on background tasks.</P>
<H5 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Using Memory</H5><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server uses all the memory you can give it, up to the total size of your information store. At that point, your entire database is in memory. The minimum amount of random access memory (RAM) recommended for Microsoft Exchange Server is 24 MB, but testing has shown that having 64 to 128 MB of RAM provides much better performance than an upgraded CPU.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To maximize the memory usage of your Windows NT Server computer</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select the Services tab, then select Server.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Select Properties, then select Maximize Throughput for Network Applications.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can also configure virtual memory to use a larger page file. It is difficult to determine exactly how large the page file should be, but a good rule of thumb is to choose 125 MB plus the amount of physical RAM. For example, if your server has 64 MB of RAM, you can set the page file size to 189 MB (125 plus 64).</P></BODY></HTML>
