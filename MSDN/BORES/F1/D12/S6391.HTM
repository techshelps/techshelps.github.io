<H3 CLASS="h2">Creating Simple Applications Without Programming</H3><P CLASS="t">Programming creates a major obstacle to developing many custom solutions. Although programming is required for more complex applications, it hinders users who are willing to build simpler systems but lack programming skills.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If users could build their own solutions without writing programs, IS departments would have more time to focus their resources on building organization-wide systems. Users at the departmental and group levels wouldn't have to wait as long to get what they need. At the same time, programmers would benefit from a development environment that can support advanced and highly specialized solutions designed to solve more demanding problems.</P></BODY></HTML>
