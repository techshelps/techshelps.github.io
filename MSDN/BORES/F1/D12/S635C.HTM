<H3 CLASS="h2">Deploy a UPS and Test it Periodically</H3><P CLASS="t">Do not take the approach that if the Microsoft Exchange-based server does not fail during a power outage, that all other servers have not failed. Make sure you are protected by an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). Many computer rooms are supposedly UPS protected. Even though this may be the case, it is possible that not all outlets are UPS protected. If you do not have a dedicated UPS, make sure that you speak with the local electricians or operations personnel and perform a test. Also note that server class UPS system batteries can wear out every three years and require replacement.</P></BODY></HTML>
