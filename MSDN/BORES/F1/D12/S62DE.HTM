<H3 CLASS="h2">Remote Mailboxes</H3><P CLASS="t">Any recipients who are not local and also are not DLs or custom recipients are treated as remote mailboxes. Remote mailboxes must always have a valid O/R address (a distinguished name is optional). </P>
<P CLASS="t">A valid O/R address is required to enable X.400 backbones of the message. If a distinguished name is successfully routed through the GWART, and no O/R address is available, a new address is constructed from the remote site proxy O/R address information in the connected sites. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If the new O/R address contains no DDA information, then the distinguished name is saved in the DDA of the O/R address with the special "MSXCHNGE" DDA Type to mark this O/R address as artificially constructed. This mechanism also enables encapsulation of Microsoft Exchange Server distinguished names over 1984 X.400 backbones. </P></BODY></HTML>
