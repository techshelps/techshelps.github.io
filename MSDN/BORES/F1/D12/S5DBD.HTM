<H3 CLASS="h2">How to Monitor a Server</H3><P CLASS="t">One of the most important elements of performance tuning is to maintain Performance Monitor logs. If you don't record this information, you will have nothing to work with. You can set these logs to record only every two or five minutes; this is sufficient for most performance tuning work and doesn't require too much storage space. </P>
<P CLASS="t">There are three major areas to watch when you are monitoring a server with live users.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Trends in submitted loads</H4><P CLASS="t">Observe whether your users are sending more messages now than they did a few months ago, or whether the average message size is increasing. These factors will change the load on the server, and if you are not aware of them, the load can slowly increase until you have a response-time problem. Microsoft Exchange Server provides counters that give an indication of the overall workload.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Service times</H4><P CLASS="t">If you monitor a server alone, it is nearly impossible to calculate the overall response times that users will experience. However, you can observe the server components of the response time, and get a general idea of whether slow server response times are becoming an issue. Microsoft Exchange Server provides counters that indicate server response times.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Resource use </H4><P CLASS="t">By observing the utilization of various resources, you can see where the bottleneck in a system is and even get an idea of where the next bottleneck might occur, after relieving the current one.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following sections describe the counters of most interest to an administrator, performance analyst, or capacity planner when performing system tuning.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Watching for Trends in the Load</H4><P CLASS="t">These counters don't provide a complete picture of the load on your Microsoft Exchange Server computer, but they will indicate trends over time if you track them.</P>

The following counters are relevant to bottleneck analysis.</P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P CLASS="t">If you observe processor utilization at a fine granularity, for example every one or five seconds, note that the counters fluctuate rapidly and will frequently hit 100 percent for short periods of time. For this reason, monitoring processor usage is more useful when averaged over a longer period of time. If you are monitoring for longer periods of time and you find that the processor usage reaches 100 percent and stays there for minutes or hours, your users are probably becoming impatient with response times. You may want to size your system for around 60 percent or 70 percent processor utilization during peak times, so that there is extra room for unexpected demands and for growth.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When you are running other services in addition to Microsoft Exchange Server on the server computer, it is recommended that you analyze per-process processor usage. This enables you to determine which services are using most of the CPU time, and how to appropriately balance the load.</P>

<P CLASS="t">The Page Faults/sec counter indicates the rate at which pages are faulted into the working sets of processes. Due to the page pool in the virtual memory system, the number of pages actually being read and written to disk is much less than the number of page faults. The page faults are of interest if you have services in addition to Microsoft Exchange Server running. In such a case, you can examine the rate of page faults on a per-process basis and determine where they are occurring. With this information, you can make application-tuning changes. For example, you might consider (carefully) adjusting the tradeoff between the information store buffer pool and the system memory pool. Also, by checking the per-process working sets, you can see identify the major memory allocations.</P>
