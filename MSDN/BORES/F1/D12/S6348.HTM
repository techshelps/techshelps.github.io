<H2 CLASS="h1">Online Backups to Tape</H2><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server includes built-in support for running online backups directly to tape media. The server does not have to be shut down, nor do users have to be logged off. Furthermore, Microsoft Exchange Server backup is integrated with Windows NT Server backup, which enables you to back up both Microsoft Exchange Server computers and file servers from the same location. You can perform full, incremental, or differential backups directly to a wide variety of tape devices, from ¼ inch cartridges to high-capacity digital audio tape (DAT) systems. </P></BODY></HTML>
