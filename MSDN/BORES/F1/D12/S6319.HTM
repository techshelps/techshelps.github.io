<H2 CLASS="h1">Moving Microsoft Exchange Server to Another Computer with a Different Hardware Platform</H2><P CLASS="t">Follow the steps outlined in the "Moving Microsoft Exchange Server to Another Computer with the Same Hardware Platform" section. However, rather than copying the entire Exchsrvr directory from the Original Server to the New Server, do the following.</P>
<P CLASS="t">From your backed-up copy of the Exchsrvr directory of the Original Server, copy the following subdirectories to the Exchsrvr directory on the New Server: Dsadata, Dxadata, Imcdata, Mdbdata, and Mtadata. If you overwrote all the files from the Exchsrvr directory of the Original Server, you would destroy your executable files.</P>
