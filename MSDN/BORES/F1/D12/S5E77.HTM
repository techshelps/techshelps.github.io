<H3 CLASS="h2">Step One: Replace Server Name with IP Address</H3><P CLASS="t">Use the following procedure to test name resolution and to ping the server computer.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To replace the server name with an IP address</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In Control Panel, double-click <B>Mail</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the <B>Services</B> tab, select <B>Microsoft Exchange Server</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Choose <B>Properties</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the <B>General </B>tab, type the Internet Protocol (IP) address rather than the server name.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Choose <B>Check Name</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This procedure will test name resolution, and it will also initiate a basic remote procedure call (RPC) ping to the Microsoft Exchange Server computer. The ping utility determines whether a network path can be made between two computers (TCP/IP only).</P>
<P CLASS="a"><img src="xerk_h01.gif"></P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>IP Address Fails to Resolve</H4><P CLASS="t">If the IP address fails to resolve to the correct Microsoft Exchange Server name, there is either a problem with the RPCs to the Microsoft Exchange Server computer, or with the IP address of the Microsoft Exchange Server computer. </P>
<P CLASS="t">At the command prompt, try to ping the IP address of the Microsoft Exchange Server computer. If this fails, there may be a networking issue or a TCP/IP configuration issue that is preventing connection to the Microsoft Exchange Server computer. This issue must be resolved before the client can connect to the server over TCP/IP.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If a ping of the IP address is successful, but a profile checkname fails to resolve the IP address, then the RPC binding order may be incorrect. Verify that the RPC binding order includes <B>ncacn_ip_tcp </B>first in the list.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>IP Address Resolves</H4><P CLASS="t">If the IP address resolves to the correct Microsoft Exchange Server computer name quickly, then continue with Step Two, below.</P></BODY></HTML>
