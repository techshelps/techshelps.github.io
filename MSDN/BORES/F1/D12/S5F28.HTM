<H2 CLASS="h1">Mapindl Tool</H2><P CLASS="t">The Mapindl tool enables you to attach a Lotus Notes Document Link (DocLink) to a Microsoft Exchange Server message when using Active Messaging. Mapindl.dll contains an OLE Automation server object that enables this process.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Mapindl.dll object is useful in situations where Lotus Notes workflow applications require the use of a messaging infrastructure for user notifications. Previously such applications required the activation of NotesMail to route and deliver these messages. When Microsoft Exchange Server was intended as the primary messaging transport, activating NotesMail resulted in redundant messaging infrastructures.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When LotusScript uses Active Messaging and Mapindl.dll, Microsoft Exchange Server can be used as the messaging transport in Lotus Notes applications. This eliminates the need for NotesMail and simplifies the overall system architecture.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Although Active Messaging and LotusScript can be used to send Microsoft Exchange messages from Lotus Notes applications, before Mapindl.dll, links could not be attached to Lotus Notes documents programmatically. This functionality is packaged as an OLE Automation object (Mapindl.Attach) for ease of use in Active Scripting. A type library (Mapindl.tlb) is also provided for access from other development languages.</P></BODY></HTML>
