<H3 CLASS="h2">Backing Up .Pst, .Ost, and .Pab Files</H3><P CLASS="t">The .pst, .ost, and .pab files are specific to each user within a Microsoft Exchange Server organization. Below are descriptions for each file type and suggestions for using and storing these files. For more information on data recovery procedures specific to each of these file types, see the ".Pst, .Ost, and .Pab Recovery" section.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>.Pst Files</H4><P CLASS="t">If users store .pst files on their local drives, and local drives are not being backed up, you cannot restore these files. If .pst files are stored on a file server, you need to include them in your backup routine. You can restore a .pst, and then add it to an existing user profile. If a user has password protected his or her .pst file and then forgets the password, you cannot recover the password or the data in that file. Make sure that your users are aware of this. You can repair a damaged .pst file, however, by running the Inbox Repair Tool (Scanpst.exe). For more information, see the "Using the Inbox Repair Tool to Repair .Pst and .Ost Files" section.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>.Ost Files</H4><P CLASS="t">Data in .ost files is at risk when changes have been made to the local .ost file and have not yet been replicated to the server-based store. If a user's computer fails, a new .ost file can be created on the replacement computer and all server-based information can be sent to the .ost file through synchronization. You can repair a damaged .ost file by running the Inbox Repair Tool. For more information, see the "Using the Inbox Repair Tool to Repair .Pst and .Ost Files" section.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>.Pab Files</H4><P CLASS="t">Personal address book files can be stored on a server directory or locally. Because most servers are backed up regularly at night, any server-based .pab files are also backed up. A .pab file may be lost when a user stores it locally and do not arrange for a backup. If the .pab entries must be replaced, this can cost an employee many hours of work and lost productivity.</P></BODY></HTML>
