<H3 CLASS="h2">Microsoft Schedule+</H3><P CLASS="t">Schedule+ uses a hidden public folder to replicate free/busy information. Within a site, this replication occurs automatically. Between multiple sites, this replication must be set up by the administrator. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The main performance consideration for an administrator working with Schedule+ is whether the user is working with a local schedule file or a server schedule file. If a local file is used, Schedule+ is very responsive and periodically updates the schedule information on the server. However, if a user chooses not to work with a local schedule file, then each change to that schedule causes interaction with the server. Initial testing has shown that not working with a local schedule file causes a significant impact on the users, and if enough users are working in this manner, then it has a negative performance impact on all users.</P></BODY></HTML>
