<H3 CLASS="h2">Public Folder Use and Replication</H3><P CLASS="t">Using public folders on a Microsoft Exchange Server computer can have a dramatic effect on the server's performance. Size, frequency of user access, various views on that folder, the number of replicas, the replication schedule, and how often its content changes are all factors that affect server performance. If many users access a public folder frequently, then the server is going to be kept busy satisfying those requests. Also, the public folder keeps track of the expansion state of each folder and the read/unread state of each message on a per-user basis.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Although public folder replication is a fast process, changes to a public folder are replicated according to the replication schedule set up by the administrator. Even if the replication schedule is set to <B>Always</B>, replication only occurs every 15 minutes. This affects the user because if replication starts when a user is accessing a public folder or the public folder hierarchy, the user will notice a sudden slowdown that improves only when the replication process is completed. If there are a number of public folder replicas to update, then this activity can place even more stress on the server and extend the replication process.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Public folders can contain messages and free-standing documents. Messages are like any other mail message as far as the resources they consume on a server. Free- standing documents, however, raise another issue for performance because they are typically large.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If you post a 1-MB file in a public folder, then any user that accesses that document brings 1 MB of data across the wire. This affects the performance of the server for every user. </P></BODY></HTML>
