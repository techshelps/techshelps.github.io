<H3 CLASS="h2">Adding the Microsoft Exchange Server Computer to the Hosts File</H3><P CLASS="t">The Hosts file is read every time a Windows Sockets (Winsock) application attempts to resolve a host name. There are no #PRE options to preload entries (LMHOSTS). You can add the Microsoft Exchange Server entry to the Hosts file and then try again without having to restart Windows. The Hosts file on Windows&nbsp;95 is located in the Windows directory. On Windows NT, it is located in the Windows\System32\Drivers\Etc directory.</P></BODY></HTML>
