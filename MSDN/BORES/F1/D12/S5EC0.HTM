<H2 CLASS="h1">Crystal Reports</H2><P CLASS="t">Crystal Reports enables Microsoft Exchange users to create, view, and distribute presentation-quality reports that contain Microsoft Exchange-specific data. Such data can include information from the Microsoft Exchange Client, and the Microsoft Exchange Server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Crystal Reports can use the following Microsoft Exchange data to create reports:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Message tracking logs that include the sender's name, date, message size, server, and so on.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Address Books that include a recipient's name, address, company name, phone, and so on. These address books can be personal address books (PABs), global address lists (GALs), or distribution lists (DLs).</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">E-mail messages, form applications, and properties of OLE Documents. This information appears in the folder contents list in the right pane of the Microsoft Exchange Client.</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">Each data source is treated as a database table, which enables you to combine data from different data sources. For example, you can combine the Message Tracking Log with an Address Book by using an e-mail address. You can also create a single report that contains historical data on all sent e-mail and sender information.</P>
<P CLASS="t">After the information is retrieved, Crystal Reports provides a rich set of summary functions and graphics to help you create a high-quality presentation.</P></BODY></HTML>
