<H2 CLASS="h1">Mailstorm Tool</H2><P CLASS="t">The Mailstorm tool is designed to assist in testing the Microsoft Exchange message transfer agent (MTA) or any other message transfer agent accessible by MAPI. This tool is often used for stress testing, but can also be used to compare delivered messages for content integrity. Messages are altered as they are touched by different components of a messaging system. Mailstorm can be used to compare the difference between the original message Mailstorm sent and the message Mailstorm received. Mailstorm is a MAPI client and sends and compares mail through the MAPI interface. </P></BODY></HTML>
