<H3 CLASS="h2">Recreating DLs on the New Server</H3><P CLASS="t">You only need to re-create DLs if you have manually moved the mailboxes to Server B. This is because the process of manually moving the mailboxes involved deleting the users on Server A. When you did this, the users were removed from the DLs. This is also the reason why all the DLs were exported.</P>
