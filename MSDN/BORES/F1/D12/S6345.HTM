<H3 CLASS="h2">Automatic Recovery Using Transaction Rollback</H3><P CLASS="t">When the Microsoft Exchange Server information store or directory services is started after abnormal server shutdown, the transaction log file is scanned for incomplete transactions. If incomplete transactions exist, they are rolled back automatically to the state in which they existed before the transaction took place. This automatic recovery operation occurs relatively quickly, because only the most recent transactions in the log must be checked. </P></BODY></HTML>
