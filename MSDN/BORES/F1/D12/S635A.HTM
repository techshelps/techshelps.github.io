<H3 CLASS="h2">Perform Periodic File-Based Backup</H3><P CLASS="t">To capture all configuration data, it is best to perform a full file-based backup periodically. Services should be shut down so that open files can be backed up. This will ensure that you have backed up all possible Microsoft Exchange related files. You may want to perform this backup during scheduled maintenance. Note that file-based backup is not required for backing up the information store and directory databases. Online backups are recommended for backing up the information store and directory.</P></BODY></HTML>
