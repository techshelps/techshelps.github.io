<H3 CLASS="h2">Building Common Groupware Applications </H3><P CLASS="t">Building applications on a messaging server goes well beyond simply sending rich-text notes with attachments. Microsoft Exchange Server includes built-in groupware for routing, discussion, reference, and tracking applications. Microsoft Exchange Server also supports highly customized groupware applications and can even be integrated into customized desktop or Microsoft BackOffice server applications. The following sections describe typical groupware applications supported natively by Microsoft Exchange Server.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Routing Applications</H4><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server enables end users to easily create person-to-person routing forms. For example, a sales manager can design a form to gather weekly sales data from salespeople. Any salesperson, whether connected to the network or mobile, can fill out the pre-addressed form and send it back to the sales manager.</P>

<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Discussion Applications</H4><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server also supports <I>discussion</I>, or <I>bulletin board</I> applications. These applications enable users to discuss topics with their co-workers through public folders, rather than carrying out conversations over e-mail and wading through their Inbox to find relevant e-mail threads. </P>
<P CLASS="a"><img src="xerk_e03.gif"></P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Reference Applications</H4><P CLASS="t">Most organizations need a central repository where users can find information. Microsoft Exchange Server <I>replicated public folders</I> provide a useful infrastructure for this type of application. Employee handbooks, product information, monthly reports, and sales data are all examples of useful information that can be published in public folders. </P>
<P CLASS="t">You can also make Internet newsgroups easily accessible to public folder users by developing applications for the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service and the Internet News Service. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Tracking Applications</H4><P CLASS="t">In most organizations, salespeople need to access information sources before making an account call. They may need to call other salespeople to determine who last contacted the customer, or review sales orders to find out whether the customer has outstanding orders. Many organizations provide this functionality through third-party products. Microsoft Exchange Server tracking applications eliminate this complexity and bring tracking functionality under the same user interface as other groupware applications. </P>
<P CLASS="t">For example, by creating a customer-tracking public folder, a salesperson can find information on the last contact with the customer, new customer contacts, and the company profile in a single location. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Client enables salespeople to customize the way they display data, to view the information in the same interface as other Microsoft Exchange Server applications, and to use custom forms designed with Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer to organize and report the information. The following figure illustrates a customized view that enables users to view account data by company.</P>
