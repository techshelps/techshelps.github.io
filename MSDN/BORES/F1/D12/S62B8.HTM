<H3 CLASS="h2">Directories, Replication, and the Bridgehead Server</H3><P CLASS="t">A <I>bridgehead server</I> acts as the door in and out of the site's directory. When you configure a directory replication connector between two sites, you can choose which server in each site will act as the bridgehead server. It is the responsibility of this bridgehead server to exchange all directory updates with the partner bridgehead server. Within a site, directory replication occurs among all servers. Because this processing is proportional to the number of directory changes that occur, it is difficult to predict how it will affect the overall performance of a server. During a migration to Microsoft Exchange Server, when the directory is changing often, or in organizations where hundreds of directory updates occur every day, the directory replication process can negatively impact performance. </P></BODY></HTML>
