<H2 CLASS="h1">Acctonme Tool</H2><P CLASS="t">The Acctonme tool completely rebuilds the postoffice address list. It can be used with Microsoft Mail version 2.1 and later postoffices. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Acctonme does not directly access the global address list (GAL) in Microsoft Mail versions 3.0 and 3.2. Because the GAL contains the names from the local postoffice, it requires rebuilding after this process is complete. For more information on rebuilding the GAL, see your Microsoft Mail documentation</P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>When to Use Acctonme</H3><P CLASS="t">Use Acctonme only when both the Admin.nme and Adminshd.nme files are deleted or irrevocably damaged. If only one of the files is damaged or missing, you can replace the damaged file with a copy of the undamaged file.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Side Effects of Using Acctonme</H3><P CLASS="t">Running this tool will result in the loss of all external postoffice names, gateway names, and local group names in the postoffice address list. Given the structure of the address list file and its connection to the group subsystem of the database, you must delete all postoffice groups before proceeding.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note   </B>As with all Microsoft Mail utilities, it is highly recommended that you back up your Microsoft Mail database before running Acctonme. You must also back up the Admin.nme file in the NME subdirectory by typing the following at the command prompt in the Microsoft Mail Database subdirectory:</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>copy \nme\admin.nme \nme\admin.old</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">As a precaution, print a report of all postoffice groups by starting the Microsoft Mail Administrator program (Admin.exe) and selecting <B>Local-Admin</B>,<B> Group</B>,<B> Print</B>,<B> &lt;</B><B><I>File or Printer</I></B><B>&gt;</B>. If necessary, you can use this list later to recreate the groups.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To rebuild your postoffice list by using Acctonme</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Delete all postoffice groups by starting the Microsoft Mail Administrator program (if you haven't already), and then select the <B>Local-Admin</B>,<B> Group</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Delete each group in the postoffice. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">If the group has an associated group folder, you will be prompted to delete the folder.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Switch to the drive and path where the Microsoft Mail database is located and then set the Admin.exe file in the NME subdirectory to zero bytes by typing the following command at the command prompt: </P>
<P CLASS="lt1"><B>nul &gt; \nme\Admin.nme</B></P>
<P CLASS="ls">When you type this command, you may receive a "File not found" error message. Disregard this message. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">From the root directory where the Microsoft Mail database is stored, run the ACCTONME tool. It will rebuild the postoffice address list so that it contains only local mailbox names (no messages are generated upon completion).</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Copy the Admin.nme file to Adminshd.nme by typing the following command from the root directory where the Microsoft Mail database is stored:</P>
<P CLASS="lt1"><B>Copy \nme\admin.nme \nme\adminshd.nme</B></P>
<P CLASS="ls">To recreate the postoffice groups, select <B>Local-Admin</B>,<B> Group</B>,<B> Create</B> in the Microsoft Mail Administrator program. Use the list generated as a guide to recreating the postoffice groups.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">To recreate the lost external user names, choose the <B>Address</B> menu option in the Mail Administrator program or use the Import tool.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">If you are using Microsoft Mail 3.0 or 3.2, start Rebuild.exe to recreate the global address list.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Restoring Postoffice Address Lists</H3><P CLASS="t">Any changes in the postoffice address list since the last backup, such as new users, will be lost when you restore the list. Therefore you need to restore the Admin.nme, Adminshd.nme, Access.glb, Access2.glb, and Access3.glb files from the backup files. </P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Adding a Lost Name into the Address List</H3><P CLASS="t">If you are rebuilding the Admin.nme file because a record is missing (for example, you see a particular user name from the Microsoft Mail Administrator program, but you do not see the user when you try to compose a message), use the following procedure.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To add a name back into the address list</P>
<P CLASS="ls">If there is not a 00000000.nme file in the Nme subdirectory of the Microsoft Mail database, create a new user and substitute that user's eight-digit ID number for 00000000 in the following procedure. The user's eight-digit ID number can be found by running the Listuser.exe program located on the database utilities disk.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the NME subdirectory of the Microsoft Mail database, copy 0000000.NME to 00000000.old. (If the file is 0 bytes long, do not perform this step.)</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the same directory, copy Admin.nme to 00000000.nme, and then make the current directory the root of the Microsoft Mail database.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Start the Microsoft Mail Administrator program and then select <B>Local-Admin</B>,<B> Modify</B>. Select the user name to be added to the address list and then record the mailbox name and alias. Return to the top level of the Microsoft Mail Administrator program, select <B>Config</B>,<B> Password</B>, and record the network and postoffice names.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Quit the Microsoft Mail Administrator program and start the MS-DOS client.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Log on as the administrative user.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Add the missing user to the personal address list by choosing <B>Address</B>, <B>Enter</B> (select <B>Microsoft Mail Address Type</B> if you have any gateways installed), and then selecting the mailbox, postoffice, network, and alias names.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Quit the Microsoft Mail program and then switch to the NME subdirectory of the Microsoft Mail database. Copy 00000000.nme to Admin.nme and Dminshd.nme.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the same directory, copy 00000000.old to 00000000.nme or create a 0-byte 00000000.nme file by typing the following at the command prompt: </P>
<P CLASS="lt1"><B>Type aaa &gt; 00000000.nme</B></P>
<P CLASS="lt1">When you type this command, you will receive a "File not found" error message. Disregard this message.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec4"></A>Removing a Record</H3><P CLASS="t">If you are rebuilding the Admin.nme file because you are trying to remove a record (for example, if you see a particular user when you try to compose a message, but you do not see the user from the Mail Administrator program), use the following procedure:</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To remove a record</P>
<P CLASS="ls">If there is not a 00000000.nme file in the NME subdirectory of the Microsoft Mail database, create a new user and substitute that user's eight-digit ID number for 00000000 in the following procedure. Then use Listuser.exe (located in the database utilities disk) to determine the ID number for that user.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the NME subdirectory of the Microsoft Mail database, copy 0000000.nme to 00000000.old. However, do not perform this step if the file is zero bytes long.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">In the same directory, copy Admin.nme to 00000000.nme, then make the current directory the root of the Microsoft Mail database.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Start the Microsoft Mail program and log on as the administrative user.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">To remove the record, from the <B>Address</B> menu, choose <B>Delete</B> (or <B>Remove</B> if you are running Microsoft Mail). Select the user and then press ENTER.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Quit Microsoft Mail.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Switch to the drive where the Microsoft Mail database is located. In the NME subdirectory, copy 00000000.nme to Admin.nme and Adminshd.nme.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Restore 00000000.nme from 00000000.old, or if the file was zero bytes long, you can zero out the file by typing the following at the command prompt:</P>
<P CLASS="lt1"><B>aaa &gt; 00000000.nme</B></P></BODY></HTML>
