<H3 CLASS="h2">Troubleshooting the AT&amp;T Mail Migration Wizard</H3><P CLASS="t">The following sections describe how to troubleshoot problems that occur during migration.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Unable to Log On to the Migration Wizard</H4><P CLASS="t">If there are problems logging on to the AT&amp;T Mail Migration Wizard, verify that you can log on to the Microsoft Exchange Client by using the same profile. If the logon process is successful, restart Windows.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Invalid Directory Message Is Displayed</H4><P CLASS="t">The AT&amp;T Mail Migration Wizard expects to find the source mail messages under the default directory of C:\Attmsg. Specify where the Access PLUS or PMX messages are located when running Attmwiz.exe, or move them to C:\Attmsg. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Not All Drives Appear in the Browse Dialog Box</H4><P CLASS="t">If you choose <B>Browse</B> and the appropriate network destination does not appear in the list, make sure that:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">The network is started.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Physical network connectivity still exists</LI></UL></SPAN><H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Mail Messages Are Not Migrated to the Microsoft Exchange Client</H4><P CLASS="t">If the source mail system was PMX, verify that when the files were transferred from the PMX server, it was done using binary mode. If the files are transferred in ASCII mode, portions of the files lose formatting. This can result in messages not being transferred or being transferred incorrectly.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec4"></A>More Messages Are in the Old Client Than in the Microsoft Exchange Client</H4><P CLASS="t">If not all mail messages are transferred, it can be caused by the following:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Messages are corrupt.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Messages are not transferred correctly from the source system.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Messages are queued (they are logged but not migrated).</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">To obtain a list of messages that were not migrated, see Attmwiz.log, the summary log file located in the Windows directory. The Attmwiz.log file can be viewed in a text editor such as Notepad.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec5"></A>Some Folder Names Are Truncated</H4><P CLASS="t">Folder names can be truncated if the source mail system is PMX. The AT&amp;T Mail Migration Wizard truncates folder names to eight characters during migration to the Microsoft Exchange Client. You can restore the long folder names after migration by choosing <B>Rename</B> from the <B>File</B> menu.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec6"></A>Messages Are Not Processed</H4><P CLASS="t">If all messages are not processed, review the Attmwiz.log file in the Windows directory using a text editor such as Notepad. Review the list of messages. If an error description of "File could not be opened" exists, run the migration again. This error may be cause by a network interruption during processing.</P></BODY></HTML>
