<H3 CLASS="h2">Using the Backup Tool</H3><P CLASS="t">The Backup tool prevents you from having to manually verify whether all Microsoft Exchange Server backups succeeded or failed. This tool uses a script that searches the Windows NT Exchange backup log files and then reports:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Statistics on each Microsoft Exchange Server computer that is backed up.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The size of each file backed up.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The amount of time each backup took.</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">This script extracts the data into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, which is routed to the daily Microsoft Exchange operations report. Therefore, only one report is needed to provide the backup status for all Microsoft Exchange Server computers.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Sample Output </H4><P CLASS="t">Each log entry for an attempted backup is in the following format:</P>
