<H2 CLASS="h1">Microsoft Exchange Server Preview Pane Extension </H2><P CLASS="t">Users running Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation can use the Microsoft Exchange Server Preview Pane Extension to add a third area for previewing the body of messages to the Microsoft Exchange Client Viewer. The contents of the <B>To</B> and <B>Subject</B> boxes can also be displayed in the preview pane message header, but no attachments or other boxes are available for preview. Users can set reminders on messages or folders. In addition, they can use this program to determine the size of a folder and its subfolders.</P>
<P CLASS="t">With Preview Pane Extension, users can mark messages as read, set reminders on messages or folders, automatically synchronize offline folders on a specified schedule, view messages in a fixed font, and move or copy messages or folders in the Microsoft Exchange Client hierarchy. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Users customize Preview Pane Extension by choosing <B>Options</B> from the Microsoft Exchange Client <B>Tools</B> menu, and then selecting the <B>Preview</B> tab. The extension dynamic-link library (DLL) for these options resides on your workstation.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Preview Pane Extension may appeal to more experienced users in your organization because it combines some of the functionality of Microsoft Schedule+ type reminder features with Microsoft Exchange Client folders and messages. However, new users will also find it easy to customize and use Preview Pane Extension.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Preview Pane Extension uses approximately 1 megabyte (MB) of space on the share where you make it available to users. Preview Pane Extension is a Microsoft Exchange Client extension that uses MAPI and supports users with Microsoft 32-bit operating systems. Preview Pane Extension supports advanced security through the Microsoft Exchange Advanced Securities Extensibility application programming interface (API). It also supports Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). When a user reads text from an Internet address in the preview pane, the text can be used as an operational Internet link if it is valid. </P>
<P CLASS="t">When an extension is added to Microsoft Exchange, another module is loaded, which can impact overall performance. The preview pane generates a remote procedure call (RPC) for each item stored on a server that is previewed by a user. Also, each window resize can cause additional RPCs. A user may notice this when working the Remote Access Service (RAS).</P>
<P CLASS="t">A Preview Pane <B>Uninstall</B> icon is included in the Microsoft Exchange program group when a user sets up Preview Pane Extension. Running the Uninstall program removes all Preview Pane Extension files. However, if the program fails to remove these files, you can delete the registry entries.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Preview Pane Extension stores its configuration data in HKEY_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Extensions by adding the following value: </P>

<PRE>4.0;c:\Windows\tripane\tripane.DLL;1;11010010000000;1101010. 
</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">You can disable Preview Pane Extension by removing this value.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note   </B>It is recommended that you distribute Preview Pane Extension to a small group of users for testing before making it available for wide release. A minimum of 30 days is recommended as a test period. Based on this experience, you can modify the documentation you send to users.</P></BODY></HTML>
