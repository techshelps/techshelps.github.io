<H3 CLASS="h2">Determine Downtime Cost</H3><P CLASS="t">Determining the cost of downtime is useful when justifying the purchase of recovery equipment. There are different models for calculating the per-hour downtime cost, which varies for each business. These calculations include lost orders per hour, delayed financial transactions, and the cost of delayed time-sensitive market decisions.
