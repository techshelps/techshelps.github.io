<H2 CLASS="h1">Sentinel Tool</H2><P CLASS="t">Sentinel monitors the status of Windows NT services, event logs, performance counters, and other types of data for many servers at one time. Sentinel also generates archives of the gathered data, and makes it available to other applications.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Sentinel tool uses server groups and modules. A <I>server group</I> contains a list of Windows NT or Microsoft Windows 95 computers, or servers, which are accessible to Sentinel through a network. A <I>module </I>gathers data, and each module type gathers a different type of data. Sentinel includes the following modules: Service, Performance, and Event Log. For more information on server groups and modules, see "Understanding Server Groups and Modules."</P>
<P CLASS="t">A module gathers data of a specified type (such as the status of Windows NT services) and is loaded into a group. The same module can be loaded into many different groups, and each group can load many different modules. This enables you to create a new module, then distribute it to other users. Other users can have different groups, but the module always gathers the data for which it was originally configured.</P></BODY></HTML>
