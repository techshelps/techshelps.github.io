<H2 CLASS="h1">Backup Types</H2><P CLASS="t">To help you establish a backup strategy, this section reviews backup types and provides a better understanding of online and offline backups.</P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Online Backups Versus Offline Backups</H3><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Exchange Server <I>online backups</I> require that the respective service (information store or directory) is running. These backups do not disrupt messaging on Microsoft Exchange Server computers. Note that you can back up the directory service without the information store running. You can also include the Windows&nbsp;NT registry in the backup job. </P>
<P CLASS="t">An <I>offline backup</I> is a file-based backup. Unlike online backups, offline backups require that all Microsoft Exchange Server services be stopped. After you stop these services, you can run the Windows NT NTbackup program to back up all files on the desired drives. </P>
<H3 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Online Backup Types</H3><P CLASS="t">An online backup is comprised of the following four types of backups:</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Normal (Full)</H4><P CLASS="t">In a <I>normal backup</I>, the entire information store and directory databases are backed up. Transaction logs are backed up and then purged. Incremental and differential backups are given context as a result of the transaction logs being purged.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>Copy</H4><P CLASS="t">A <I>copy backup</I> is similar to a full backup, except there is no context marking. The context for the incremental and differential backups does not get changed. Log files are not deleted. A copy backup is analogous to taking a snapshot of the databases at a given point in time without impacting other backup routines. You can use a copy backup to reproduce a particular scenario in a test environment.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec4"></A>Incremental</H4><P CLASS="t">In an <I>incremental backup</I>, only a subset of the information store and/or directory is backed up. Only changes since the last full or incremental backup (whichever was most recent), are written to tape. Only the .log files are written to tape. These files are then purged. The purging of transaction logs sets the context for the next backup job.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For a typical incremental backup, a tape of the last full backup is required, as well as tapes for each incremental restore up to the point when the system experienced an outage. For example, a full backup can be performed on Sunday evening, while incremental backups are performed on a daily basis from Monday through Friday. If an outage occurs on Friday morning, a full backup can be performed and each incremental backup tape can be restored through Thursday. Services should not be started until the final incremental tape has been restored. Note that an incremental backup is disabled when circular logging is enabled.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec5"></A>Differential</H4><P CLASS="t">A <I>differential backup</I> backs up the changes in the information store and/or directory since the last full (normal) or incremental backup. However, most administrators do not mix differential and incremental backups in a series. Only .log files are backed up, but they are not purged from disk. For example, if a transaction log and database restore are required, only two tapes are required for the differential backup. The two required tapes would be the latest full backup and the latest differential backup. Note that differential backup is disabled when circular logging is enabled. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If the transaction logs are intact since the last full backup, only the last full backup tape is required. This is because the restore process plays back all logs from the point of the last full backup to the current Edb.log file, thus restoring all transactions to date. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Caution   </B>When restoring data, make sure that you do not select <B>Erase existing data</B>; otherwise, you'll erase the log files to date.</P></BODY></HTML>
