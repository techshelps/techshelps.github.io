<H2 CLASS="h1">Microsoft Mail Export Tool</H2><P CLASS="t">The Microsoft Mail Export tool (Eximwiz.exe) converts Microsoft Exchange Bulk Export format (.csv) files to Microsoft Mail import format. After creating the output file, you can use the tool to interactively import addresses into a Microsoft Mail postoffice on the network, or you can e-mail the import file to external recipients.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition, new functionality enables you to export from Microsoft Mail, and create a .csv file to add Microsoft Mail recipients as Microsoft Exchange custom recipients.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Eximwiz is useful when directory synchronization between a Microsoft Exchange Server implementation and Microsoft Mail is not a viable option (if, for example, you are trying to populate a trading partner's Microsoft Mail system with relevant addresses, such as purchasing agents, from your global address list).  Eximwiz can also be used to manually perform directory synchronization between a Microsoft Exchange Server computer and a foreign mail switch that does not support the Microsoft Mail Dirsync protocol. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note   </B>The Eximwiz tool supports the Windows 95 and Windows NT version 3.51 or later operating systems for <I>x</I>86 platforms only. </P></BODY></HTML>
