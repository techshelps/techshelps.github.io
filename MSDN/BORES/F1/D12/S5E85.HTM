<H2 CLASS="h1">Administrative Mailbox Agent</H2><P CLASS="t">The Microsoft Exchange Server Administrative Mailbox Agent enables you to create and delete Windows NT accounts and Microsoft Exchange accounts. When you send a request to the Administrative Mailbox Agent, the Agent (running on a Windows NT Server computer with the appropriate permissions) creates a Windows NT account and the associated Microsoft Exchange account. After the Windows NT account is created, the Agent sends you a confirmation message. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note   </B>The Agent can only create Windows NT accounts if requests are received from Microsoft Exchange administrators with the appropriate permissions. For more information on how to grant the required permissions, see "Granting Access Permissions" later in this document.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Administrative Mailbox Agent consists of a Microsoft Exchange Server application known as the Mailbox Agent. This application is implemented as a Windows NT service that runs on a Windows NT server. Its status as a Windows NT service enables it to run unattended. Note that the Agent does not need to run on the same Windows NT Server computer as the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Microsoft Exchange Administrative Mailbox Agent has its own mailbox on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer where it is installed. It uses this mailbox to receive requests from administrators and users and to send back confirmations and error messages. The Microsoft Exchange Address Book contains an entry (Admin Agent) that you can use when addressing mail to the agent.</P></BODY></HTML>
