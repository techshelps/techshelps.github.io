<H2 CLASS="h1">DL Import Tool</H2><P CLASS="t">The Microsoft Exchange Distribution List (DL Import) tool provides a single, standardized, and time-effective process for creating distribution lists by extracting information from other previously created lists. These lists may have been created with a Microsoft Access database, a Microsoft Excel macro, or another application. </P>
<P CLASS="t">DL Import eliminates the inefficiency of having data stored in numerous formats, created in numerous ways, and residing on different servers. This tool also automates the process of updating distribution lists on a regularly scheduled basis. </P></BODY></HTML>
