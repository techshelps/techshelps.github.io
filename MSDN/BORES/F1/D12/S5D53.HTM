<H3 CLASS="h2">Running the Performance Optimizer</H3><P CLASS="t">This process has not been automated. Therefore, to complete this process, you must be logged on to the Windows NT Server computer where Microsoft Exchange Server is installed. To optimize performance, run the Microsoft Exchange Server Performance Optimizer (located in the Microsoft Exchange program group). The Performance Optimizer will stop all Microsoft Exchange Server services, and then prompt you for the following information:</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec0"></A>How many users will this server host?</H4><P CLASS="t">This should be the number of users located in that office.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec1"></A>What services will run on this server?</H4><P CLASS="t">Select all options (Private Mailbox, Public Folders, Connector, and Multi-server. The services that should be chosen depend on the organization.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec2"></A>How many users will be in the entire Microsoft Exchange Server organization?</H4><P CLASS="t">The recommended number of users is between 1,000 and 9,999 (depending on the organization).</P>
<H4 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>How much memory should Microsoft Exchange Server use?</H4><P CLASS="t">It is recommended that this remain at zero, which means that Microsoft Exchange will use all available memory.

<P CLASS="ls">Choose <B>Next</B>. A window is displayed indicating that the program will run tests on the disk partitions. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">After the tests are completed, choose <B>Next</B>. Performance Optimizer displays a window that indicates the optimal locations for the various Microsoft Exchange Server databases and transaction logs.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Choose <B>Next</B> to accept the defaults.</P>
