<H2 CLASS="h1">SNA&nbsp;Server Management Architecture</H2><P CLASS="t">SNA&nbsp;Server uses MngAgent and MngCli to manage services and resources, and to report the status of the services and resources to the Manager. The management architecture works to direct the flow of management data between server computers and administration clients. </P>
<P CLASS="t">In SNA&nbsp;Server, the services write data into the management object, which in turn notifies Manage Agent (MngAgent). If clients currently connected to the server need notification of the change, MngAgent sends the information to Manage Client (MngCli) on the client computer via DMOD. This information is then downloaded to the shared management object, which in turn notifies the Manager on the client computer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Other applications besides SNA&nbsp;Server Manager may run on a client computer to request status or control the same set of services and resources. More than one such application may run at the same time. MngCli will maintain a single copy of the management data, and a single set of links to MngAgent, to support all the applications. Typically MngCli will open a link to all the servers in the SNA&nbsp;Server subdomain that it is managing. For each server, MngCli will have a single link to the MngAgent on that server.  The management data from all the servers will be merged to represent the all the services and resources for the subdomain.</P>
<P CLASS="t">MngAgent will maintain a single copy of the management data for the server on which it is running. The management data from all the services and resources on that machine will be merged to represent the server. MngAgent can accept links from more than one MngCli at the same time, allowing multiple administration clients to monitor and manage the server.</P></BODY></HTML>
