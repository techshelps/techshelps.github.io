<H2 CLASS="h1">Account Mapping</H2><P CLASS="t">Users who need to establish connections with host computers via SNA&nbsp;Server are assumed to have a Windows NT account. In each host security domain, the Windows NT account can be associated with just one host account. If password synchronization is enabled, a particular account can only be related to a single Windows NT account, so password changes on that account from the host applies to only a single Windows NT account.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The association between accounts is relational; that is, the Windows NT account and the associated host computer account do not need to be spelled the same.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The host account cache can store host account names and password of any length; however, SNA host computers generally impose a limit of eight to 10 characters. </P></BODY></HTML>
