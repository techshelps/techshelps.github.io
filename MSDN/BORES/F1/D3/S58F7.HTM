<H2 CLASS="h1">Host Security Integration Components</H2><P CLASS="t">Host Security Integration is comprised of components packaged as three setup options. Each one works with the Windows NT primary domain or resource domain. These include:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Windows NT Account Synchronization Service</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Host Account Synchronization Service</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Host Account Cache</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="a"><img src="snrk_e01.gif"></P>
<P>Figure 5.1    This figure shows the Host Security Integration components and where they may reside in a security domain. </P>
<P CLASS="t">These services are installed using two methods. The Windows NT Account Synchronization Service and the Host Account Cache are installed using the Host Security Setup located on the SNA&nbsp;Server CD-ROM. The Host Account Synchronization Service is installed during SNA&nbsp;Server Setup. The latter is one of the available options in the <B>Microsoft SNA&nbsp;Server - Select Components</B> dialog box. For more information see the <I>Microsoft SNA&nbsp;Server Getting Started</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This section describes each of the services and the underlying components that are installed during Setup.</P></BODY></HTML>
