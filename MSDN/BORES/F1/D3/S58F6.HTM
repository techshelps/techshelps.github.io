<H2 CLASS="h1">Automatic Logon for APPC</H2><P CLASS="t">SNA&nbsp;Server supports automatic logon for APPC applications communicating with mainframes and AS/400 computers. This feature operates by providing the associated host security domain username and password in the APPC conversation startup request. In addition, this feature also provides the host username in the 5250 session startup program initiation parameter (PIP) data. This allows the user to bypass the AS/400 logon screen for 5250 terminal sessions.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The automatic logon only applies to invoking transaction programs (TPs) initiated in the Windows NT domain. The application must run on either SNA&nbsp;Server or any native client of SNA&nbsp;Server. The user must be logged into the Windows NT domain. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Automatic logon applies to any WinAPPC or WinCPIC application, whether it is delivered by a third party or locally developed. To start automatic logon, the application must invoke an APPC conversation with the program-provided security (see AP_PGM in the <I>Microsoft SNA&nbsp;Server APPC Programmer's Guide</I>). It then must provide the value "MS$SAME" for both the APPC user name and password. SNA&nbsp;Server will replace these keywords with actual host account information when it sends the conversation startup request to the host computer.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Future versions of SNA&nbsp;Server will include automatic logon for 3270 and other dependent LU applications. They will also include invoking APPC TPs on Windows NT running in the Windows NT account associated with a host account used in the conversation startup.</P></BODY></HTML>
