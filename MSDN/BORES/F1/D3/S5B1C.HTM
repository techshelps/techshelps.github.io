<H3 CLASS="h2">Additional Information</H3><P CLASS="term1"><B>SNA Connections: Throughput Bytes/Sec</B></P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>SNA Logical Unit Sessions: Throughput Bytes/Sec</B></P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>SNA Adapter</B> <I>adaptername</I><B>: Throughput Frames/Sec</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">These counters provide an indication of SNA activity. When observing these counters, it may also be useful to start SNA&nbsp;Server Manager and double-click on the server (the same one being observed in Performance Monitor). This will allow you to see the number of users and sessions that correlate with a particular level of SNA activity. This information, combined with data about the processor and memory load, can help you understand the load and performance on your servers. Low throughput does not necessarily mean poor performance, but instead may simply indicate that current activity is low.</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Measurement of frames/second may provide a better indicator of server load than bytes per second, because server overhead (for interrupt handling and message processing) increases per frame, not per byte. That is, a large frame with many bytes requires about the same overhead as a small frame with fewer bytes.</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">For suggested ways to tune SNA&nbsp;Server to maximize communications throughput, see "Options for Maximizing Communications Throughput."</P>

<P CLASS="term1"><B>SNA Adapter</B> <I>adaptername</I><B>: Successful Connects</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">These counters may be useful for detecting patterns in which connections or adapters fail for short periods and then return to normal. (Event logs can provide more information about causes of failure.) You might also want to set up Performance Monitor alerts with these counters, so that an alert is triggered if too many failures are occurring. </P></BODY></HTML>
