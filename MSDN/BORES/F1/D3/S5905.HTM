<H3 CLASS="h2">Associating Connections with Security Domains</H3><P CLASS="t">Since the user may have different host accounts in several host security domains, SNA&nbsp;Server must be able to choose the appropriate host account for single sign-on when the user opens a session. Therefore, an SNA connection defined in SNA&nbsp;Server Manager can be assigned to a host security domain. The administrator uses SNA&nbsp;Server Manager to assign the connection using the <B>Insert</B> menu or by dragging a connection to a host security domain folder. A host security domain can be assigned an unlimited number of connections, but each connection can be a member of only one host security domain.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When the client chooses an LU resource (alias or pool), the client and server perform resource location to determine which connection will support the session, and, based on that determination, from which host security domain the host account information will come.</P></BODY></HTML>
