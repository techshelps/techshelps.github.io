<H3 CLASS="h2">SNA&nbsp;Server Management Architecture: <BR>SNA&nbsp;Servers of Variables</H3><P CLASS="t">The variables that affect Manage Agent or Manage Client are found in the following Registry location:</P>
<P CLASS="t">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<BR>    SOFTWARE<BR>        Microsoft<BR>            SnaServer<BR>                CurrentVersion<BR>                    Manage</P>
<P CLASS="t">These are the variable names and descriptions:</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>ClientExt: REG_MULTI_SZ  </B><I>Client extension DLL names</I></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">This is a list of extension DLLs used by Manage Client. The DLLs are used by Manage Client to recognize manage data being sent by Manage Agent. If a DLL is removed from the Registry, Manager Client would not respond to the data, even if Manage Agent knows about it.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>MaxDomains: REG_DWORD                                     </B>Default: <B>10</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">An optional value that  limits the number of subdomains the client can manage. The default (and maximum number allowed) is 10; however, this number can be decreased depending on the need. The Registry is not created during Setup and must be manually added. It is only used by Manage Client.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>MaxProcess: REG_DWORD                                       </B>Default: <B>64</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">This value can be increased or decreased to manage the number of client processes. The Registry is not created during Setup and must be manually added.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>MaxServer: REG_DWORD                                        </B>Default: <B>150</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">This variable corresponds to the number of subdomains to which the client has access. For example, if the client is able to access 10 subdomains that have 15 SNA&nbsp;Server computers each, then they can access a maximum of 150 servers. This value can be decreased to manage the number of server computers the client can access. It is only used by Manage Client. The Registry is not created during Setup and must be manually added.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>MaxTypes: REG_DWORD                                         </B>Default: <B>50</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">This variable allows the administrator to set the maximum number of manage object types supported. The value can be increased or decreased depending on the need. The Registry is not created during Setup and must be manually added. </P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>ServerExt: REG_MULTI_SZ</B><I>   Server Extension DLL Names</I></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">This is a list of extension DLLs used by Manage Agent. The DLLs are a list of services that are defined and active in SNA&nbsp;Server. If one of the services in the string is removed, Manage Agent will not receive any management information from the service. An entry in the Registry also implies that the corresponding service has been added. For example, if Host Print Service was not installed, then the DLL should not be added on the SNA&nbsp;Server computer. However, it should still appear on the client computer (in ClientExt), as another server may have installed Host Print Service, and SNA&nbsp;Server Manager may need to display data from that server. In summary, ClientExt should have a DLL entry for all known services and ServerExt should only have an entry for those services that reside on the same machine.</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">If a service is added using the Registry, then it must be added to both the client and server entries. Also, any additions require changes to SNA&nbsp;Server Manager, so the client can see it. Therefore, it is recommended that any service additions be made using SNA&nbsp;Server Manager or Setup.</P></BODY></HTML>
