<H1 CLASS="cht">Chapter 6 Printer Definition Files</H1><P CLASS="t">Host Print Service lets you specify the capabilities of a printer to override the defaults provided by the Windows NT printer driver. </P>
<P CLASS="t">By default, jobs submitted by Host Print Service to a Windows NT print queue rely on the printer's Windows NT driver to send to the physical printer the data required to perform such formatting tasks as breaking lines and starting a new page. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Applications that bypass the formatting function of the Windows NT printer driver can use codes specified in a printer definition file to control the physical printer for a particular printer session under Host Print Service. To use the file, open the properties page of the printer session, click the <B>Printing</B> tab, select <B>PDT</B>, and then type the fully qualified path of the file in the box. For more information about using the PDT file, click <B>Help</B> on the printer session properties dialog box.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Creating a printer definition file consists of two steps: First, you create a source text file that defines the codes that can be used to control the printer. Second, you run a program to compile the information in the text file into a binary file that can be used by Host Print Service.</P></BODY></HTML>
