<H2 CLASS="h1">Security</H2><P CLASS="t">Network operating system security is an important aspect of all computer environments. This section describes the encryption used by SNA&nbsp;Server Host Security Integration.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows NT and RACF (on the mainframe) protect password information for their own user accounts through the use of a one-way cipher and do not store the user's clear-text password. Theoretically, there is no way to recover the original password from the one-way cipher text in a reasonable length of time. However, the host security integration feature must produce the host password in clear text for the host computer session and needs to use a reversible encryption for the host account cache. To protect this information from individuals trying to break into the system, it uses very strong encryption: RC-4, with 128-bit keys.</P>
<P CLASS="t">RC-4 with 40-bit keys is the strongest encryption method currently permitted for export by the United States government for bulk encryption applications. Since the Host Account Cache stores only data on personal identification, the export limitations do not apply and the implementation using 128-bit keys is freely exportable.</P>
