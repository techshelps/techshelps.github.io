<H2 CLASS="h1">Message 217</H2><P CLASS="t"><B>Adapter initialization error</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">local MAC address = <I>value</I></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>EXPLANATION AND ACTION: </B>The DLC (802.2) link service detected an error while trying to initialize the NDIS adapter. This error can be caused by one of the following conditions:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1"> <SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    Token ring cable or MAU fault. Check the cable from the PC to the MAU and try again. If the problem persists, replace the cable and/or the MAU and try again.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"> <SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    Duplicate network address on ring. Check the address of this adapter against the addresses of all the other adapters on the same ring. If there is a duplicate, change one of the addresses and try again.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"> <SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    Temporary contention condition on ring. These errors are only temporary and should clear themselves. The token ring service will attempt to initialize the adapter after a delay, and initialization should then be successful.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"> <SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    Adapter speed mismatch. Check that the token ring adapter is set for the same speed as the rest of the adapters on the ring. If not, change the speed and try again.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"> <SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    Token ring adapter hardware fault. Replace the token ring adapter and retry.</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">If none of these actions solves the problem, contact support personnel for your network.</P></BODY></HTML>
