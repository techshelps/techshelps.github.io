<P>Figure 5.3    Graphical representation of automatic logon.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When a user activates an SNA application on the client computer, it works with the SNA&nbsp;Server subdomain to perform resource location to determine which SNA&nbsp;Server computer and connection to use to open the LU session.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The SNA application on the client computer provides a replacement keyword as a placeholder for security information during session initiation. The format depends on the type of LU session established. For example, the string "MS$SAME" is used for APPC or C-PIC applications.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The SNA&nbsp;Server (or node) detects the replacement keyword and determines the Windows NT user name under which the client is logged on. This step limits automatic logon support to users running native client-server sessions, since only these sessions support Windows NT authentication. For example, TN3270 is not supported because the TN server cannot determine the client's Windows NT user name.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The node uses resource location to locate the host account cache <SPAN CLASS="Symbol">¾</SPAN> either a backup up SNADATABASE service running on the same machine as SNA&nbsp;Server </P>
<P CLASS="t">or the master host account cache in the Windows NT domain running SNA&nbsp;Server. The node sends a lookup message to the host account cache. The request includes the Windows NT user name and host security domain name. It requests the corresponding host account name and password.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The SNADATABASE service checks that the Windows NT account exists in the host account database, and that the account is still a member of users group in the Windows NT domain representing the host security domain. If any of these checks fails, the user record is purged from the host account cache. If all checks pass, the SNADATABASE service returns a reply containing the host account name and password to SNA&nbsp;Server, using encrypted RPC. SNA&nbsp;Server substitutes the host account name and password into the SNA data stream and the host computer sees a regular session start up request containing the host account information.</P></BODY></HTML>
