<H3 CLASS="h2">Variables for Clients Not Running Microsoft Networking</H3><P CLASS="t">The information in this section affects the logon process for clients running Windows version 3.<I>x</I> but not running Microsoft Networking. With these clients, two logons must take place: one for access to the Windows NT domain and one for access to the servers in the domain.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>For Clients Running Windows version 3.<I>x</I> </H4><P CLASS="t">For clients running Windows version 3.<I>x</I> but not running Microsoft Networking, users' names are stored each time they log on for access to servers. At the time of the next logon for access to servers, a  user's name is offered in the logon dialog box. (Password information is not stored.)</P>
<P CLASS="t">Also, for clients running Windows version 3.<I>x</I> but not running Microsoft Networking, command-line options can be used to specify the user name and password when starting the SnaBase (which is called <B>wnap</B> in the Windows 3.<I>x</I> environment). The syntax for this is:</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>wnap</B> <B>/user:</B><I>username</I> <B>/pwd:</B><I>password</I></P>
<P CLASS="t">An example of a client for whom the preceding command might be appropriate is a client running Windows version 3.<I>x</I> with Novell&reg; NetWare&reg;.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A user who does not use a password may want to type the preceding syntax without typing any characters after <B>/pwd:</B>. This will suppress the dialog box that requests a password.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the preceding syntax line is used on a client running Microsoft LAN Manager (which is a Microsoft network software product), the <B>user</B> and <B>pwd</B> options are ignored, since the only logon needed for clients using Microsoft Networking is the logon in the Windows NT domain (that is, no additional logon is needed to access the servers in the domain).</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>For Clients Running MS-DOS</H4><P CLASS="t">For clients running MS-DOS but not running Microsoft Networking, the following section and line can be placed in the SNA.INI file to simplify the process of starting up the SnaBase and logging on to the servers in the Windows NT domain. When typing the section name, include the square brackets.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>[SnaBase]<BR>LogonUserName=</B><I>username</I></P>
<P CLASS="t">Note that for clients running MS-DOS but not running Microsoft Networking, command-line options can also be used to specify the user name and password when starting the SnaBase on the client. The syntax for this is:</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>snabase</B> <B>/user:</B><I>username</I> <B>/pwd:</B><I>password</I> </P>
<P CLASS="t">An example of a client for whom the preceding command might be appropriate is an MS-DOS – based client running Novell NetWare.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A user who does not use a password may want to type the preceding syntax without typing any characters after <B>/pwd:</B>. This will suppress the dialog box that requests a password.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the preceding syntax line is used on a client running Microsoft LAN Manager (which is a Microsoft network software product), the <B>user</B> and <B>pwd</B> options are ignored, since the only logon needed for clients using Microsoft Networking is the logon in the Windows NT domain (that is, no additional logon is needed to access the servers in the domain).</P></BODY></HTML>
