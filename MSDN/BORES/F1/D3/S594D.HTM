<H2 CLASS="h1">Important Information Regarding IBM PS/2</H2><P CLASS="t">In certain circumstances, when a connection is activated using SDLC or X.25 on an IBM PS/2 computer configured with an IBM MPA/A (or the MicroGate equivalent), the computer freezes and fails to respond to keyboard or mouse input.</P>
<P CLASS="t">There are two problems that cause this problem to occur:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">The IBM PS/2 abios disk controller tries to allocate all available map registers for large data transfers. The standard SDLC drive allocates two when the SDLC connection is activated and never releases them. The disk controller hangs while waiting for the map registers. The entire system will slowly hang as paging and disk access are stopped.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The IBM PS/2 abios disk controller performs DMA data transfers at the interrupt processor level. Windows NT defines this as an illegal operation. The SDLC driver allocates a DMA resource, then the disk controller generates an interrupt, and tries to acquire the DMA resource. It cannot acquire it and will never be able to as the disk controller has locked out the driver that owns it. The system is locked.</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">Both problems are solved by applying the alternate IBMSYNC.SYS driver. If the default IBMSYNC.SYS driver is used, the first problem is solved through the support of a special Registry parameter for the IBMSYNC driver.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A special version of the IBMSYNC.SYS driver is located on the SNA&nbsp;Server 2.11 CD-ROM. To install the driver, see the Release Notes (README.WRI) on the CD-ROM.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Using the default IBMSYNC.SYS driver, the following Registry parameter prevents the driver from requesting mapped registers. This version of the driver does not correct the other problem observed on IBM PS/2 computers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<BR>    SYSTEM<BR>        CurrentControlSet<BR>            Services<BR>                IBMSYNC<BR>                    Parameters</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>DontUseMapRegisters: REG_DWORD:      </B>Default: 1</P>

<P CLASS="t">After configuring this option, restart SNA&nbsp;Server.</P>
