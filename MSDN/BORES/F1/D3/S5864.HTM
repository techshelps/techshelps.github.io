<H1 CLASS="cht">Chapter 1 SNA&nbsp;Server Architecture</H1><P CLASS="t">SNA&nbsp;Server installations are increasing. Some customer sites have over 10,000 users using thousands of LUs in a single subdomain. The newly redesigned SNA&nbsp;Server Manager allows the administrator to immediately obtain the status of each SNA&nbsp;Server computer in every subdomain while reducing the load on the LAN and on the server computers and while improving response times.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SNA&nbsp;Server Manager incorporates many new features and a new proxy-agent architecture for management information. SNA&nbsp;Server Manager was redesigned to be extensible and scaleable.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SNA&nbsp;Server Manager provides the ability to monitor multiple subdomains. This encourages limiting subdomains to a small size (a maximum of 15 SNA&nbsp;Server computers) for easier management and administration.</P>
<P CLASS="t">New services are integrated into SNA&nbsp;Server, along with new management objects. The new services include Shared Folders, AFTP, Host Print Service, TN3270, TN5250, SNA Remote Access Service, and Host Security.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The ability to access management data from applications other than SNA&nbsp;Server Manager will become increasingly important as OLE becomes more prevalent and administrators create their own scripted applications. This requires not only an automated OLE interface, but also the ability to support several concurrent applications accessing the same data. SNA&nbsp;Server is designed for these future enhancements.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This chapter explains SNA&nbsp;Server and some of its underlying architecture.</P></BODY></HTML>
