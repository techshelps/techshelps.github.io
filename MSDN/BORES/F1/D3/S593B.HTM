<H3 CLASS="h2">Lan Manager Workstation: SNA&nbsp;Server of Variable</H3><P CLASS="t">If you have an application written to one of the SNA APIs offered by SNA&nbsp;Server (such as APPC, CPI-C or LUA) on Windows NT clients using Microsoft Networking, and your application uses a large number of Windows NT threads, you may need to add a Registry variable on the clients to permit correct operation.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This Registry variable is called MaxThreads. It can be set on a Windows NT-based client and is found in the following location:</P>
<P CLASS="t">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<BR>  SYSTEM<BR>    CurrentControlSet<BR>      Services<BR>        LanmanWorkstation<BR>          Parameters</P>
<P CLASS="t">This is the variable name and description:</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>MaxThreads:REG_DWORD:</B><I>number</I></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">This variable specifies the number of threads available for use by the Workstation service. Set <I>number</I> to a value between 30 and 255, depending on how heavily the workstation is used by APPC. Try to make the value large enough to support all the APPC usage, but low enough to avoid using excessive amounts of memory.</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">If this variable is not set, it defaults to 6 threads.  </P></BODY></HTML>
