<H3 CLASS="h2">SNA&nbsp;Server TN3270 Service: SNA&nbsp;Servers of Variables</H3><P CLASS="t">The variables that affect the TN3270 service are found in the following Registry location:</P>
<P CLASS="t">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<BR>    SYSTEM<BR>        CurrentControlSet<BR>            Services<BR>                TN3270<BR>                    Parameters </P>
<P CLASS="t">These are the variable names and descriptions:</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>AuditEvents: REG_EXPAND_SZ {ON|OFF}        </B>Default:  <B>OFF</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">This registry entry controls whether audit events are written to the event log. The default is off, preventing logging of audit events. If it is turned on, the audit events will be written to the event log.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>ConnectionTimout: REG_DWORD</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The TN3270 service monitors active and idle times. If the service has been idle for a specified number of minutes, it will issue a connection time out and close the connection.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>DefaultInboundRUSize: REG_DWORD</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">This is the specification for the RU size for inbound (TN3270 client to host) SSCP data.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>DefaultOutboundRU Size: REG_DWORD</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">This is the specification for the outbound RU size (host to TN3270 client) SSCP data.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>CloseListenSocket: REG_EXPAND_SZ {ON|OFF}      </B>Default: <B>OFF</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The TN3270 service monitors its port for available LUs. If this entry is turned on, the service stops monitoring the port when all of the configured LUs are in use. It resumes monitoring when an LU becomes available.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>NoTN3270E: REG_EXPAND_SZ {ON|OFF}        </B>Default: <B>OFF</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Part of TN3270 service is the incorporation of TN3270E protocols. If this Registry entry is set to on, the TN3270 service does not use the TN3270E protocols. This is helpful because some TN3270 clients cannot negotiate successfully with a TN3270E server and the system will stop responding. This Registry entry disables the TN3270E protocols allowing the client successful negotiation.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>GetClientHostName: REG_EXPAND_SZ {ON|OFF}   </B>  Default:  <B>OFF</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">When this is set to on, TN3270 service translates the client IP address to the resolved name before passing the client status information to SNA&nbsp;Server Manager.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>InitStatusDelay: REG_DWORD</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">This specifies the number of seconds during which the TN3270 service does not send status messages to the client during startup. It prevents a influx of messages at the client during startup.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>LogToSNAEventLog: REG_EXPAND_SZ {ON|OFF}     </B>Default: <B>OFF</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">If this is set to on, the TN3270 service logs its events on the same machine as the SNA&nbsp;Server computer in the subdomain. If this is set to off, it logs events to the local machine. </P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>MessageCloseDelay: REG_DWORD</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">When the TN3270 service forces a client disconnect, it sends a message to the client. This option specifies the number of seconds TN3270 service keeps the connection active after sending the termination message. This message appears to inform the user of the disconnection because some client computer screens are cleared once they are disconnected from the server.</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>ReplaceRUSize: REG_EXPAND_SZ:{ON|OFF}      </B>Default: </P>
<P CLASS="dt1">TN3270E printer sessions will hang if the host computer sends a BIND RU that specifies an Inbound Maximum RU size of 0, which indicates that maximum RU size does not apply on the session. This causes the print job to remain in "Spooling…" state in the Windows NT Print Manager until the printer session is disconnected.</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The administrator needs to ensure that the TN3270 service sends inbound data. The data is sent in Request Units (RUs) up to the Default Inbound Size specified in the <B>Options</B> dialog box of the TN3270 administrator.</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">The TN3270 service also has a Registry entry that allows a 0 RU size in the BIND image transmitted to the client to be overwritten by the Default Inbound RU Size specified in the <B>Options</B> dialog box. If this entry is set to ON, then the value for the inbound RU size is set to the specified Default Inbound RU Size if the host has not specified a maximum size.</P></BODY></HTML>
