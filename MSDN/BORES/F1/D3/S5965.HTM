<P CLASS="term1">X'1152'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">A link service reported a connection failure to the node.</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">When this error continues to occur during connection establishment, it is due to a mismatch between the parameters specified in SNA&nbsp;Server Manager and either the local hardware, the physical connection, or the remote system configuration.</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">If the problem occurs during data transfer, it can be due to an unreliable physical connection (such as noise on an SDLC line) or faulty hardware.</P>

<H3 CLASS="h4"><A NAME="sec3"></A>DFT Connections</H3><P CLASS="t">The DFT outage codes are derived from the line check codes generated by the 3X74 control unit. The line check code will have been logged on a previous #261 message. Take the outage code from the message, convert it to decimal, and add 484 to it. The result is the line check code. Here is an example: an outage code of 11 converts to 17 in decimal. 484 + 17 = 501, which is the line check code. Look up the line check code in the maintenance information manual for your control unit and follow the actions indicated there.</P>
