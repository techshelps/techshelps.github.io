<H3 CLASS="h2">SOGA Channel-Attachment Technology</H3><P CLASS="t">SNA&nbsp;Server supports two channel-attachment technologies—Bus &amp; Tag and ESCON (Enterprise System Connection). Both offer speed improvements over high-speed token-ring, Ethernet, and FDDI. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Bus &amp; Tag Provides Greatest Flexibility</H4><P CLASS="t">Bus &amp; Tag channel attachment uses parallel copper cable and offers speeds up to 4.5 mega<I>bytes</I> per second. This is a significant improvement over high-speed token rings, which only provide16 mega<I>bits</I> per second. </P>
<P CLASS="t">SNA&nbsp;Server's channel attachment capability provides deployment flexibility because of the many channel vendors offering solutions. The hardware vendors that offer Bus &amp; Tag products that comply with SOGA include Barr Systems, Bus-Tech, Cabletron, Computerm, and Polaris Communications. Contact information and white papers for these companies is located in the SNA&nbsp;Server Companion Product Catalog at http://www.microsoft.com/sna.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>ESCON Provides Greatest Performance</H4><P CLASS="t">A second channel attachment option is ESCON (Enterprise System Connection). ESCON uses standard fiber cable and increases the speeds offered by channel attachment up to 200 mega<I>bits</I> per second (roughly 17 mega<I>bytes</I> per second). Currently, Polaris Communications has released a PCI ESCON solution for SNA&nbsp;Server. Amdahl, Bus-Tech, and Dr.Materna have also announced support for SNA&nbsp;Server ESCON products.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SNA&nbsp;Server takes advantage of these high-speed channel attachment options by supporting up to 250 concurrent host connections. Each channel device can support multiple host PUs. SNA&nbsp;Server supports up to 5,000 concurrent users running up to 15,000 concurrent sessions.</P></BODY></HTML>
