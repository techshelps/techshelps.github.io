<H2 CLASS="h1">Password Synchronization</H2><P CLASS="t">Password synchronization automatically updates passwords so they are the same for associated accounts in all configured security domains. The user, or a privileged administrator, can initiate a password change on any host or Windows NT computer, and the password synchronization feature will apply the change to the rest of the security domains.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Password synchronization must be configured by the system administrator before use. Synchronization changes can be sent in both directions or limited to only one direction. In addition, a user can selectively enable synchronization for only some of his or her host computer accounts.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Generally, specific third-party software must usually be installed on host computers for password synchronization to work. The exception is AS/400s running V3R1 or later, for which SNA&nbsp;Server provides built-in support for unidirectional synchronization, applying Windows NT changes to the AS/400. It can be enabled on Windows NT or the AS/400 without any additional host code.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For password synchronization to work in a Windows NT security domain, the user must be running on a 32-bit platform and must be logged into the Windows NT domain. Alternatively, the Windows NT security administrator can initiate a password change for the user.</P></BODY></HTML>
