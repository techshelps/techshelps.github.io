<H2 CLASS="h1">Flexible SNA Gateway Deployment Strategies</H2><P CLASS="t">SOGA offers three models for SNA gateway deployment in an enterprise network: <I>branch-based</I>, <I>centralized</I>, and <I>distributed</I>. The<B> </B>branch-based model is the traditional way to deploy SNA gateways, in which the SNA gateway is placed in branch offices and communicates with the host using SNA protocols, either via SDLC leased-lines or via DLC that is bridged or tunneled across the WAN. </P>
<P CLASS="t">In a centralized model, the SNA gateways are placed at the data center and connect to the host using SNA protocols, such as high-speed token-ring or channel attachment. The centralized model has emerged recently as a means to isolate the SNA traffic to the data center, thus avoiding the need to support SNA on the WAN. The centralized SNA gateways provide split-stack or TN3270 service for local and remote desktops that connect to the gateways using standard LAN protocols. Microsoft SNA&nbsp;Server has for some time supported both the branch-based and centralized deployment models. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The distributed model was originally proposed by Microsoft as a key element of SOGA and supported through a capability in SNA&nbsp;Server called the distributed link service. The distributed link service, which became available in Service&nbsp;Pack&nbsp;1 for SNA&nbsp;Server 2.11 (Service Pack 1 for SNA&nbsp;Server 2.11 is available free of charge to existing SNA&nbsp;Server 2.11 customers. The Service Pack can be ordered on CD-ROM, by contacting Microsoft Sales, or can be downloaded from Microsoft's Internet FTP server), enables SNA&nbsp;Server to be deployed concurrently at  branch and central sites. The branch-based SNA&nbsp;Server computers provide client-to-server support and connect to the central SNA&nbsp;Server computers using TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, or Banyan VINES protocols. The central </P>
<P CLASS="t">SNA&nbsp;Server computers provide server-to-host support and connect to the host via high-speed token-ring or direct channel attachment using SNA protocols. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The distributed deployment approach provides greater flexibility and better cost-effectiveness than either of the branch-based or centralized approaches alone. Compared to a branch-based deployment, the distributed approach eliminates the time-outs associated with bridging or tunneling 802.2 using routers, improves host response times, and simplifies network management. Compared to a centralized deployment, the distributed approach decreases WAN usage and supports NetView&reg; management of the branch-based SNA&nbsp;Server computers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The three SNA gateway deployment models are not mutually exclusive. In fact, depending on variables such as multiple host locations, an organization might implement one, two, or all three of these deployment strategies in combination. On the following pages, we will examine each approach in more detail.</P></BODY></HTML>
