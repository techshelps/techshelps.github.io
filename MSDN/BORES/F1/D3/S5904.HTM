<H3 CLASS="h2">Enabling Users</H3><P CLASS="t">Windows NT users must be enabled before they can participate in security integration. The list of Windows NT users who are enabled for the given host security domain is stored in the Windows NT user database. When the host security domain is created, SNA&nbsp;Server Manager also creates a Windows NT local group using the same name as the Windows NT domain. To enable a user in a given security domain, this group must be added to the user's account, or to a Windows NT group of which the user is already a member. The group can be added to the user's account by any the Windows NT User Manager or any other means supported by Windows NT.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Enabling a user does not create a user record in the host account cache. The administrator or the end-user must run UDConfig to create and initialize the record after enabling the account. </P></BODY></HTML>
