<H1 CLASS="cht">Chapter 5 Host Security Integration Architecture</H1><P CLASS="t">Host Security Integration is a new feature in SNA&nbsp;Server 3.0. It lets you store passwords from multiple operating system environments in a central location, providing security and ease of use for the end-user.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Host Security Integration is composed of three installable components: the Host Account Cache, Password Synchronization, and Security Integration Services. The three services provide users with a simplified logon and maintenance of the many passwords they may need to access Windows NT and host security domains. This chapter provides an in-depth look at Host Security Integration and its internal structure.</P></BODY></HTML>
