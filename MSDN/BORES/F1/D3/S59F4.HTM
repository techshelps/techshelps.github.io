<H2 CLASS="h1">Message 263</H2><P CLASS="t"><B>The controller has reported a non-productive receive timeout</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">Your host system may have gone down</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>EXPLANATION: </B>The DFT controller has not received anything from the host for some time. The connection may have been lost with the host. If the connection has been lost, eventually the controller will report it as failed. It is possible that the connection has not been lost if the host is very slow at polling its remote nodes. The values for these timeouts are configured on the controller.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>ACTION: </B>If this message persists, contact your host administrator.</P></BODY></HTML>
