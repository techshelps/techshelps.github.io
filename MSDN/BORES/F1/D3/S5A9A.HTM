<P CLASS="t"><B>EXPLANATION: </B>The COMM START command failed because the file shown cannot be loaded. If the file is listed with an extension of .EXE, the file is executable. If the file is listed with no extension, it is a .DLL file.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>ACTION: </B>Check to see that the file exists and that the PATH environment variable for an executable file, or LIBPATH for a .DLL file, is set up to point to the directory containing the file. Also, make certain that there is enough memory to load the executable files.</P></BODY></HTML>
