<P CLASS="t"><B>ACTION: </B>On the OS/2-based client, check that the device driver line for COMBASE.SYS is correct in the CONFIG.SYS file. This line should have been added by the installation program, and should have the following form:</P>
<P CLASS="t">DEVICE=C:\COMMSRV\DEV\COMBASE.SYS C:\COMMSRV</P>
<P CLASS="t">In this line, both instances of C:\ should be replaced by the actual path of the COMMSRV home directory.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For SNA&nbsp;Server 1-User, this line should be in the following form:</P>
<P CLASS="t">DEVICE=C:\COMMWS\DEV\COMBASE.SYS C:\COMMWS</P>
<P CLASS="t">In this line, both instances of C:\ should be replaced by the actual path of the COMMWS home directory.</P></BODY></HTML>
