<H3 CLASS="h2">Variable for Windows-Based Clients Running the 3270 Applet</H3><P CLASS="t">The variable in this section applies only to clients running the 3270 Applet with Windows NT or Windows version 3.<I>x</I>. On either type of client, the variable is set in the WIN.INI file. This is true even for Windows NT-based clients; the WIN.INI file for such clients belongs in the operating-system root directory.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The variable is set in the WIN.INI file by adding a section called <B>[SnaServerWin3270]</B> to the file and adding a line with the following syntax to that section:</P>
<P CLASS="term1"><B>RetryConns=</B>{ <B>yes</B> | <B>no</B> }      Default: <B>no</B></P>
<P CLASS="dt1">If set to <B>yes</B>, causes the 3270 Applet to retry unsuccessful connection attempts in certain circumstances where the condition causing the problem is probably temporary (see the next paragraph). Otherwise, the 3270 Applet does not retry unsuccessful connection attempts; instead, the user can retry manually by disconnecting and connecting again.</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">Conditions that are considered temporary are:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI2">All LUs in the requested pool are in use at that moment (code 0x0057).</LI><LI CLASS="ULI2">The requested LU pool is not found in the configuration, which may indicate that the server through which the client is attempting to connect is inactive (code 0x0A0E).</LI><LI CLASS="ULI2">The requested connection is inactive at that moment (code 0x1002).</LI><LI CLASS="ULI2">The host (or controller unit) has not yet responded with an ACTPU command (code 0x1010).</LI><LI CLASS="ULI2">The host (or controller unit) has not yet responded with an ACTLU command (code 0x1011). </LI></UL></SPAN></BODY></HTML>
