<H2 CLASS="h1">Message 237</H2><P CLASS="t"><B>Protocol timer Ti has expired</B></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>EXPLANATION:</B> Ti is an activity timer for DLC (802.2) traffic between two remote computers. When a server fails to receive a DLC (802.2) frame within the activity timer (Ti) from a remote computer with which it is communicating, the activity timer (Ti) elapses and this error message is logged. This may occur because the LAN is heavily loaded or because the remote computer has been turned off.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>ACTION: </B>Check that the remote computer is still functioning correctly. If the LAN is heavily used, the activity timer (Ti) may need to be reconfigured by changing your LAN operating system configuration.</P></BODY></HTML>
