<H3 CLASS="h2">Host Account Synchronization Service</H3><P CLASS="t">During SNA&nbsp;Server Setup, the SNAHOSTPROCESS and Host Security Interface DLLs are installed if the Host Account Synchronization Service is included as one of the installation options.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Account Synchronization is only installed to support automatic password synchronization. This service is not necessary if you use single sign-on with manual password update, in which the administrator or users store host account information in the Host Account Cache via Host Account Manager (UDConfig).</P>
<P CLASS="t">This service is generally installed on SNA&nbsp;Server computers. Its operation is not dependent on SNA protocol; however, third-party Host Security Interface DLLs may be. This service must run in the same account as the SNAPMP service.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>SNAHOSTPROCESS Service</H4><P CLASS="t">This Setup option installs a single Windows NT service, SNAHOSTPROCESS, also known as the Host Account Synchronization Service. This Windows NT service supports the Host Security Interface API, MDSI (Multi-Domain Synchronization Interface). Host Security Interface DLLs are written by third-party vendors to notify Windows NT of host password changes initiated on the host and to notify host computers of password changes initiated by Windows NT.</P></BODY></HTML>
