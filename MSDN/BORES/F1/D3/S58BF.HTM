<H3 CLASS="h2">LU Support</H3><P CLASS="t">The SNA&nbsp;Server node can support as many as 15,000 sessions.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When using LU type 6.2, an SNA&nbsp;Server LU can be either the primary logical unit (PLU), or the secondary logical unit (SLU). The partner LU can reside in a type 2.1 node, within an upstream type 5 node, or within the SNA&nbsp;Server node itself.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When using LU type 0, 1, 2, or 3, an SNA&nbsp;Server LU is always an SLU, and the partner LU in an upstream type 5 node is always the PLU. With LU type 0, session-level cryptography is supported, within certain limits, on the Request Unit Interface (RUI). Session-level cryptography is implemented through CRV requests; the RUI application(s) must perform all necessary processing. For details about the limits to session-level cryptography and about the processing to be carried out by the RUI application(s), see the <I>Microsoft SNA&nbsp;Server LUA Programmer's Guide</I>. With all interfaces other than RUI, CRV requests are rejected with a negative response.</P></BODY></HTML>
