<H2 CLASS="h1">Efficient Wide-Area Network Use</H2><P CLASS="t">SNA gateways rely on the existence of an efficient wide-area networking infrastructure based on hubs, bridges, and routers to provide internetworking services that link branch and central sites. WAN-attached branches require a cost-effective solution for accessing frame relay, leased-line, or ATM networks. Additionally, many legacy devices such as automated teller machines, bisync printers, and ASCII terminals still need to be connected to host systems but cannot make effective use of the WAN. SOGA completes many WAN solutions by linking these legacy devices to the data center through the same wide-area network. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Branch-based SNA gateways can use WAN technologies, such as DLSw, Frame Relay, ATM, X.25, and leased-line SDLC. Centralized and distributed SNA gateways require a TCP/IP-based or other WAN The distributed link service supports the following routable protocols: TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, and Banyan VINES. In all cases, an efficient WAN is provided by leading internetworking vendors. SOGA merely offers the means to make better use of the existing WAN environment.</P></BODY></HTML>
