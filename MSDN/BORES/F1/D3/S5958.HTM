<H2 CLASS="h1">Message 10</H2><P CLASS="t"><B>(</B><B><I>value</I></B><B>) Resource Allocation Error</B></P>
<P CLASS="t">SUBCODE INFORMATION:</P>
<P CLASS="t">X'1179'  An APPC session activation request from an unknown remote LU or an unknown mode (which would normally have been accepted using an implicit incoming remote LU or mode) could not be accepted. Either there was insufficient Windows NT memory available (system RAM or hard disk), or the maximum number of active APPC modes or remote LUs has already been reached.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>ACTION: </B>Try to free up Windows NT system memory and then retry. If the problem persists, provide network support personnel with the event log file(s) related to SNA&nbsp;Server, SNA&nbsp;Server trace file(s), and a description of how many sessions and services were running when the problem occurred. For information about SNA&nbsp;Server log and trace files, see the <I>Microsoft SNA&nbsp;Server Administration Guide</I>.</P></BODY></HTML>
