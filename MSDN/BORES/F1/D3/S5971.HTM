<H2 CLASS="h1">Message 31</H2><P CLASS="t"><B>(</B><B><I>value</I></B><B>) SNA&nbsp;Server Manager command failure, rc = </B><B><I>value</I></B></P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>EXPLANATION: </B>A command issued by SNA&nbsp;Server Manager failed.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>SUBCODE INFORMATION:</B></P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'06'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">COMMAND_IN_PROGRESS: This code should not normally occur.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'07'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">COMMAND_NOT_RECOGNIZED: This code should not normally occur.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'09'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">SESSION_ACTIVATION_FAILED: An attempt to start an APPC session via SNA&nbsp;Server Manager failed. This log is accompanied by one of the APPC session activation failure messages (message 7, 14, 15, 17, 18, 22, 24, 25, or 26). These messages provide more information about the failure.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'0A'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">COMMAND_RACE_REJECT: A change number of sessions (CNOS) request (either Activate or Deactivate APPC sessions) made through SNA&nbsp;Server Manager failed because the partner LU was also trying to change the session limit for the specified mode. Retry the command.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'0B'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">SESSION _LIMIT_CLOSED: A CNOS request made through SNA&nbsp;Server Manager failed because the partner LU will not allow the session limit for the specified mode to be raised above zero. This may not be a permanent condition; try the CNOS request later. If the problem persists, contact support personnel for your network.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'0C'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">SESSION_LIMIT_NOT_ZERO: An activate session request made through SNA&nbsp;Server Manager has failed because the session limit was not zero. This may occur because the partner LU initialized the session limit immediately before SNA&nbsp;Server Manager attempted to do so. No action is required.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'0D'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">LU_SESSION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: SNA&nbsp;Server Manager issued an activate session request that violates the session limit for the LU.</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">In most cases, the LU session limit should be larger than the sum of the session limits of all the modes associated with the LU (remembering to allow for SNASVCMG modes). If this is not the case, some modes may not available, or may only allow a reduced number of sessions.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'0E'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">REQUEST_EXCEEDED_MAXIMUM_ALLOWED: This code should not normally occur.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'0F'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">RESOURCE_FAILURE_NO_RETRY: A CNOS request failed to complete because of a permanent resource failure. This error is caused by the partner LU violating the CNOS protocol. Obtain a trace of the error, and contact your network support personnel with the trace file and the event log file(s) related to SNA&nbsp;Server.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'10'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">ALLOCATION_ERROR: A CNOS request failed because no SNASVCMG session could be allocated to perform the CNOS exchange. This may occur because the connection required has not been activated, or the partner LU rejected the BIND request. If the error occurred because the connection was not active, activate it and retry the request. If the BIND was rejected, contact your network support personnel with the event log file(s) related to SNA&nbsp;Server.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'11'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">UNRECOGNIZED_MODE_NAME: A CNOS request failed because the partner LU does not recognize the specified mode name. This error signifies a configuration mismatch between the local LU and the partner LU.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'12'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">PARAMETER_ERROR_BAD_LU_NAME: This code should not normally occur.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'13'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">PARAMETER_ERROR_BAD_RESOURCE NAME: This code should not normally occur.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'14'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">PARAMETER_ERROR_MISSING_PARAMETERS: This code should not normally occur.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'16'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">PARAMETER_ERROR_BAD_ADDRESS: This code should not normally occur.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'17'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">PARAMETER_ERROR_SECURITY_ERROR: This code should not normally occur.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'18'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">PARAMETER_ERROR_MIN_GT_MAX: This code should not normally occur.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'1A'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">RESOURCE_ACTIVE: SNA&nbsp;Server Manager tried to activate a connection when it was already active. This may occur as part of normal operation, for example, if an application activates the connection immediately before SNA&nbsp;Server Manager issues the command. No action is required.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'1C'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">RESOURCE_INACTIVE: SNA&nbsp;Server Manager tried to deactivate a connection when it was already inactive. This may occur as part of normal operation, for example, if the connection is deactivated because of an outage immediately before SNA&nbsp;Server Manager issues the command. No action is required.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'1D'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">NO_LINK: SNA&nbsp;Server Manager tried to activate a switched connection, but all the appropriate link services are being fully used. Deactivate unused connections using the appropriate link services and retry the command.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'1E'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">NO_PRIVILEGE: This code should not normally occur.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'1F'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">PARAMETER_ERROR_FORCE_ERROR: This code should not normally occur.</P>
<P CLASS="term1">X'22'</P>
<P CLASS="dt1">ABEND_PROG_ERROR: This code should not normally occur.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>ACTION:</B> Provide network support personnel with the event log file(s) related to SNA&nbsp;Server, the SNA&nbsp;Server configuration file, internal trace file(s), and the number and description of the displayed return code. For information about SNA&nbsp;Server log files, configuration files, and trace files, see the <I>Microsoft SNA&nbsp;Server Administration Guide</I>.</P></BODY></HTML>
