<H2 CLASS="h1">Introduction</H2><P CLASS="t">An enterprise computing environment may include various operating systems such as Windows NT, UNIX, AS/400, and mainframes. Each computing environment has its own security database that defines access rights within the environment. Users are represented by an account name and corresponding password. A user working within this type of network structure may have several different passwords to gain access to each system.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When there is no coordination between the computing environments, the burden is on the user to remember several different account names and passwords. The passwords for each account may not be, and probably aren't, the same. This process can be especially difficult when some accounts are used infrequently.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Another problem is that each computing environment imposes its own password maintenance policies, such as password length and the length of time for which a password is valid. These policies may not be, and probably aren't, coordinated between the computing environments. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Host Security Integration addresses the problem by providing secure storage for the user's host accounts, tools for maintaining the same password in all  </P>
<P CLASS="t">environments, and automatic logon to SNA host computers in an enterprise computing environment. This approach coordinates existing host security databases, rather than forcing a migration to a single, shared security database.</P></BODY></HTML>
