<H2 CLASS="h1">High-Performance SNA&nbsp;Server Configurations</H2><P CLASS="t">A key component of SOGA is a high-performance SNA gateway. One indicator of performance is the availability of high-speed, server-to-host connection methods. SNA&nbsp;Server supports powerful channel-attachment options available from leading host connectivity vendors: Amdahl, Barr Systems, Bus-Tech, Cabletron, Computerm, Dr.Materna, and Polaris Communications. Today, many organizations seek to replace their old IBM front-end processor and controller gear with new, open channel-attached solutions to gain better performance and save on administration and maintenance costs. Based on the latest Intel&reg; and RISC processors, channel-attached SNA&nbsp;Server computers provide greater speed, better scalability, more flexible upgradeability, and, most importantly, significantly better cost-effectiveness than traditional dedicated hardware devices. Channel-attached SNA&nbsp;Server computers are the optimal platform for deploying the distributed link servicein mainframe environments.</P></BODY></HTML>
