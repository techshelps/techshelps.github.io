In addition, all nonclustered index keys are deleted and reinserted, regardless of whether or not they were updated. Full delete/insert is used when on-page delete/insert cannot be used: either when there is not enough room on the page for the new row, or when a clustered index key is updated.</P></BODY></HTML>
