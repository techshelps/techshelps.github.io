<H3 CLASS="h2">An Application for Ensuring Security</H3><P CLASS="t">You can create an automated system that creates groups and assigns permissions based on responses to queries made by other applications or data such as organization charts or job title lists.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To create an application that sets up security measures for a database system, you can use Visual Basic file I/O, OLE, or an API to retrieve information from the organization chart or other file or application. You can then use this information to create Login, User, or Group objects and insert them into the Logins, Users, or Groups collections. Permissions are then assigned by using the <B>Grant</B> method for Table, Database, or StoredProcedure objects.</P></BODY></HTML>
