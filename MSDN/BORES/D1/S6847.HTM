<H3 CLASS="h2">Redesigning Tables</H3><P CLASS="t">The following conditions are those that would dictate table redesign:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1"><B>Condition:</B> The tables are very wide, resulting in fewer data rows fitting on a data page. Therefore, the data page chain is very long and requires a larger data cache to hold all required data. In addition, this circumstance can cause excessive physical page reads due to data cache limitations.
<P CLASS="lt1"><B>Action:</B> Such tables are candidates for normalization or vertical segmentation, which results in smaller tables and a greater number of data rows per data page. Therefore, data retrieval performance should improve, provided the data cache is sufficient. If this action is taken, be sure to account for the new design with respect to updates, inserts, and deletes.</P></LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"><B>Condition:</B> The tables are huge, containing many rows of data. Therefore, not all relevant data can fit into the available data cache, resulting in excessive physical page reads from disk.
<P CLASS="lt1"><B>Action: </B>Such tables are candidates for horizontal segmentation. Horizontal segmentation is most beneficial when only a subset of the data is normally accessed. In addition, fewer rows per table results in faster retrievals when a table scan is involved. If this action is taken, be careful to account for the new design with respect to updates, inserts, and deletes.</P></LI></UL></SPAN></BODY></HTML>
