<H2 CLASS="h1">Thread Priorities</H2><P CLASS="t">Windows NT uses 32 numerical thread priorities, ranging from 1 (the lowest) to 31 (the highest) with 0 being reserved for system use. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Threads 1 through 15 are variable priority in that the scheduler adjusts the priority based on thread behavior. The base priority of a thread is the base level from which these upward adjustments are made. The current priority of a thread is called its dynamic priority. Interactive threads that yield before their time slice is up will tend to be adjusted upward in priority from their base priority. Compute-bound threads that do not yield, consuming their entire time slice, will tend to have their priority decreased, but not below the base level. This arrangement is often called heuristic scheduling. It provides better interactive performance and tends to lessen the system impact of "CPU hog" threads.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows NT also uses additional priority adjustments based on other events such as momentarily boosting thread priority when it returns from an I/O call, when returning from a user-mode subsystem call, and when receiving keyboard input. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Priority threads 16 through 31 are termed real time and do not vary in priority based on behavior. This provides more deterministic scheduling, which is useful for near-real-time systems.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Although there is a numerical priority for each thread, these are usually referred to within a Win32 program by their process priority flag or thread priority flag. There is a mapping of these flags to numerical thread priorities, which is detailed in the Win32 software developer's kit and <I>Windows NT Resource Kit</I>,<I> Volume</I> <I>3</I>. In this article, threads are referred to by their numerical equivalent.</P></BODY></HTML>
