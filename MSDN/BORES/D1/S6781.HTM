<H2 CLASS="h1">Looking Ahead</H2><P CLASS="t">Microsoft has been long engaged in strategic development for the active Internet, with the goals of making it easy for customers to get on the Internet, making it safe and reliable for significant business and consumer applications, and creating a viable business model that will support the industry and its consumers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">As a result, Microsoft is well positioned to devise and implement a comprehensive active Internet strategy to meet the needs of corporate users, consumers, content creators, software vendors, Web publishers and other information providers for a unified computing/Internet experience.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To deliver the full potential of the active Internet, Microsoft uses ActiveX&trade; technologies—a robust framework for creating interactive content using software components, scripts, and existing applications that can be embedded in HTML documents. Specifically, ActiveX technologies enable developers to build Web content easily by using ActiveX controls (formerly OLE controls), active scripts, and active documents.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The ActiveX server framework allows developers to create the same rich, interactive applications for Microsoft BackOffice, leveraging their existing experience, knowledge, and tools. ActiveX server controls and ActiveX server scripts, written with a variety of scripting languages, like Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition, PERL, and JScript, provide the building blocks for the next generation of server-driven active content. Together, these ActiveX controls and scripts make it easy for organizations to integrate Microsoft SQL Server and other BackOffice products with the Internet for building active Web sites, conducting business, and developing corporate intranets.</P>
