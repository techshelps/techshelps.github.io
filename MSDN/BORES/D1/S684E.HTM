<H2 CLASS="h1">Network Protocol Issues</H2><P CLASS="t">SQL Executive requires a Net-Library that allows a trusted connection. The only Net-Libraries that support a trusted connection are named pipes and multiprotocol.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Additionally, if you have ever had a parallel installation of SQL Server with both version 4.21 and version 6.0 running on the same machine and SQL Server version 6.0 or version 6.5 is set up to listen on an alternate named pipe, you must change the registry entry for the ServerHost value for SQL Executive so it connects to the correct pipe. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Caution</B>   Incorrect changes or deletions made to the Registry can damage Windows NT and prevent the system from running normally. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Changes to the ServerHost value in the Registry can be found in:</P>

<PRE>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE on Local Machine
   \SOFTWARE
      \MICROSOFT
        \MSSQLServer
           \<B>SQL Executive</B>
              \ServerHost
</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">For example, if you have set up SQL Server 6.5 to listen on <B>\\.\Pipe\Mssql\Query</B>, you would enter this for the ServerHost value. Stop and restart SQL Server for the changes, particularly the network protocol, to take effect.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If SQL Server is set up to listen on multiprotocol and not on named pipes, the SQL client configuration utility must also have multiprotocol as the default Net-Library. In addition, the <B>Advanced </B>tab of the SQL Client Configuration Utility must include the Windows NT computer name in the <B>Server </B>box and MultiProtocol in the <B>DLL</B> Name box. Click <B>Add/Modify</B> to add this advanced configuration if it is not already present. You must also add the server name to the <B>ServerHost</B> key in the Registry as listed above.</P></BODY></HTML>
