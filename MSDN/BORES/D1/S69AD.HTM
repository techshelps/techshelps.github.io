<H2 CLASS="h1">sp_help_sourcetext Procedure</H2><P CLASS="t"><B>sp_help_sourcetext</B> is a stored procedure that addresses formatting problems encountered with the system stored procedure <B>sp_helptext</B>. The source text of views, triggers, stored procedures, rules, and defaults are stored in the <B>syscomments</B> table. <B>sp_helptext</B> can be used to view that text, providing it was not saved in encrypted format. The text is stored as a series of 255-byte segments. When <B>sp_helptext</B> prints the source text of an object, it treats these arbitrary 255-byte boundaries as newlines. This breaks up the displayed source in ways that make it difficult to read.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>sp_help_sourcetext</B> addresses that problem by not treating the 255-byte boundaries as newlines, reproducing the original source text. <B>sp_help_sourcetext</B> can be used as a functional replacement for <B>sp_helptext</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">This version of <B>sp_help_sourcetext</B> works on SQL Server versions 4.21a and later.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>sp_help_sourcetext</B> is created as a stored procedure in the <B>master</B> database.</P></BODY></HTML>
