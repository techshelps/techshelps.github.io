<H3 CLASS="h2">Security Issues</H3><P CLASS="t">In a client/server relationship, multiple clients and servers communicate across one or more linked and shared networks. SQL Server's security system prevents unauthorized clients from gaining access over shared networks to data stored on SQL Servers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SQL Server allows the system or database administrator to specify the clients that can log in to the server. The three SQL Server security modes are:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Standard security
<P CLASS="lt1">SQL Server prompts the client for a username and password each time a connection is requested. Trusted connections are also supported by this mode.</P></LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Integrated security
<P CLASS="lt1">SQL Server obtains the information from the Windows NT security system, removing the need for additional logins. Clients that connect in this mode are said to have "trusted connections."</P></LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Mixed security
<P CLASS="lt1">SQL Server also allows a combination of security methods.</P></LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">The SQL Server default is standard security mode. Excel clients can connect to SQL Server with a trusted or standard connection. If you decide to implement SQL Workbook Publisher's intranet component, the SQL Server security mode must be set to mixed or standard. If you do not implement SQL Workbook Publisher's intranet component, you can use whichever security mode you think is appropriate for your needs.</P>
