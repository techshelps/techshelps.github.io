<H3 CLASS="h2">Open Data Services </H3><P CLASS="t">Open Data Services functions as the network connection handler for SQL Server. In the past, Open Data Services and the SYBASE Open Server were often referred to "conceptually" as the front end of SQL Server. However, they were different implementations that attempted to perform the same function. But it is literally true that SQL Server is an Open Data Services application. SQL Server uses the same Open Data Services library (Opends*.dll) as any other Open Data Services application. Open Data Services manages the network, listening for new connections, cleaning up failed connections, acknowledging "attentions" (cancellations of commands), and returning result sets, messages, and status back to the client. SQL Server clients and the server speak a private protocol known as tabular data stream (TDS). TDS is a self-describing data stream. In other words, TDS contains "tokens" that describe column names, data types, events (such as cancellation), and return status in the client/server "conversation." On the server side, SQL Server writes directly to TDS, passing through Open Data Services. On the client side, open interfaces of DB-Library and Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) package the SQL statements in TDS format. Both DB-Library and ODBC use a client implementation of the Net-Library.</P>
