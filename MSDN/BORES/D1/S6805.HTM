<H3 CLASS="h2">Microsoft Windows NT Backup</H3><P CLASS="proch">To verify the names of the files to back up</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Make sure SQL Server is running.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Go to a query window.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Set your database to <B>master</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Execute:</P>
<P>select * from sysdevices where cntrltype = 0 or cntrltype = 2</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="ls">Note the values in the <B>phyname</B> column.</P>
<P CLASS="proch">To perform a backup using Windows NT</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Stop SQL Server. </P>
<P CLASS="ls">On the <B>Start</B> menu, point to <B>Programs</B> and then <B>Administrative Tools (Common)</B>. Click <B>Backup</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Back up all the data and log device files, including Master.dat. By default, the files you'll need to back up end in the extension .dat.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Copy all the data and log device files to tape or to a temporary directory other than their original locations and other than \Sql, \Sql60 or any of their subdirectories. This prevents accidental deletion of the SQL directory.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1"><B>Note</B>   This step assumes that you are backing up your data and log device files before upgrading to SQL Server version 6.5. If you choose to back up your SQL Server version 6.5 database, do not copy data and log device files to \Mssql.</P>
<P CLASS="t">It is a good idea to have a recent backup of the Registry. Refer to the section "Backing Up Disk Files to Tape" in the Windows NT documentation to learn how to back up the local Registry to tape. After the upgrade successfully completes, you can delete the temporary directory. </P></BODY></HTML>
