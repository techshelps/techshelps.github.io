<H2 CLASS="h1">System Processor: CPU</H2><P CLASS="t">In trying to determine the CPU architecture that is right for your particular needs, you are attempting to estimate the level of CPU-bound work that will be occurring on the hardware platform. As far as SQL Server is concerned, CPU-bound work can occur when a large cache is available and being optimally used or when a small cache is available and a great deal of disk I/O activity, aside from that generated by transaction log writes, is occurring. The following questions must be answered:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Will the system be dedicated to SQL Server?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">How many users or processes will access the SQL Server?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">What will the level of transaction throughput be?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Is the SQL Server a departmental system or an organization system?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Will there be a large number of concurrent users accessing the SQL Server?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Will there be a great deal of aggregation occurring on the SQL Server?</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">The answer to these questions may have already come from the requirements. If not, you should be able to make some reasonable estimates. The bottom line is: Purchase the most powerful CPU architecture you can justify. This justification should be based on your estimates, user requirements, and the logical database design.</P></BODY></HTML>
