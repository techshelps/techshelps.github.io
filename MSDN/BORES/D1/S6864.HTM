<P CLASS="t">The System Management Server (SMS) provides a method for centrally managing software and hardware for corporate networks. It provides an integrated system to:</P>

The SMS incorporates Microsoft SQL Server as a back-end database server. It uses SQL Server to store its inventory database.</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">SMS collects and maintains hardware and software inventory for an entire enterprise. This inventory information is stored in a SQL Server database, and there is one such inventory database per site.</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">The <I>central site </I>is the topmost site or is the root of the site hierarchy. An SMS system is composed of a central site that stores system-wide information and can have any number of sites beneath it. The central site requires a SQL Server database. </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">A <I>primary site</I> is any site that has its own site database. A site without a database is called a <I>secondary site</I>. A primary site can have one or more primary sites beneath it as well as one or more secondary sites beneath it.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">A secondary site cannot store its inventory information. A secondary site forwards all its inventory and status information to a primary site above it in the site hierarchy. Also, a secondary site can have no sites beneath it. </LI></UL></SPAN></BODY></HTML>
