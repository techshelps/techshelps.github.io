<H3 CLASS="h2">Read Consistency</H3><P CLASS="t">SQL Server provides both statement-level and transaction-level read consistency. This produces repeatable reads, an important feature for long running transactions with multiple queries that need to see the same image of the data throughout.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SQL Server allows applications to achieve the best balance between read consistency and concurrency by supporting configurable transaction isolation levels. Transaction isolation levels determine how transactions interact with one another, as described in the following table. </P>
