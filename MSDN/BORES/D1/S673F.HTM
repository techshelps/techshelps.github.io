<H1 CLASS="cht">Introduction</H1><P CLASS="t">Welcome to the <I>Microsoft SQL&nbsp;Server Resource Guide</I>. This guide is designed for people who are, or want to become, expert users of Microsoft&reg; SQL&nbsp;Server&trade;. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If you are responsible for designing a database solution, administering one or more SQL Server databases, or programming applications to streamline database activities, this guide is for you. It has been compiled largely from articles written by Microsoft staff in answer to frequently asked questions and to provide insights and usage ideas.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition to the information in this guide, various SQL Server utilities are included on the Microsoft BackOffice&trade; CD-ROM. Throughout the guide, you will learn about different uses for SQL Server. Demonstrations of these product applications can be found on the CD-ROM. If you develop SQL&nbsp;Server database systems, you can pick up code snippets from the CD-ROM. Also included on the CD-ROM are product add-ons and stand-alone applications you can use to simplify your administration duties.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The <I>Microsoft SQL&nbsp;Server Resource Guide</I> supplements the documentation included as part of the Microsoft SQL&nbsp;Server product and does not replace the documentation as the source for learning how to use Microsoft SQL&nbsp;Server.</P></BODY></HTML>
