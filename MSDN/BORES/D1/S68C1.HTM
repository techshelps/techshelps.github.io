<H3 CLASS="h2">Objects Created in a Transaction</H3><H4 CLASS="h5"><A NAME="sec0"></A>SQL Server 6.5 </H4><P CLASS="t">Objects can be created within a transaction. These operations are protected by the standard transactional rules and may be committed or rolled back as necessary. However, creating an object in a transaction causes locks to be held on system tables in the database until the creating transaction commits or rolls back. Use caution when you create objects inside a transaction; this includes the creation of temporary objects in the <B>tempdb</B> database.</P></BODY></HTML>
