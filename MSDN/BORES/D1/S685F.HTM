<P CLASS="lt1">Neither foreground boost nor the heuristic priority adjustment will cause an application to change classes from normal to real time, or vice versa.

The SQL Server Setup program sets this during installation. This is mainly to prevent the database server from being CPU-starved by foreground applications and is the best setting for a dedicated SQL Server.</LI></UL></SPAN></BODY></HTML>
