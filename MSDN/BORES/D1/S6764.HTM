<H2 CLASS="h1">Shared-Disk and Shared-Nothing Clusters</H2><P CLASS="t">In a shared-disk cluster, all processors have direct access to all disks and data, but they do not share main memory. An extra layer of software called a distributed cache or lock manager is required to globally manage cache concurrency among processors. The Digital VMS cluster and Oracle Parallel Query Option are the most common examples of a shared-disk parallel database architecture. Since access to data is serialized by the lock or cache manager, the shared-disk cluster has some of the same scalability limitations as shared-memory SMP systems. The following illustration shows a shared-disk cluster.</P>

<P CLASS="t">The shared-nothing cluster<I> </I>architecture avoids the exotic interconnects and packaging of a scalable shared-disk cluster by connecting each disk to one or two servers<I>. </I>In a shared-nothing cluster, each node has its own memory and disk storage. Nodes communicate with one another by exchanging messages across a shared interconnect. Each node in a shared-nothing cluster is a free-standing computer with its own resources and operating system. Each is a unit of service and availability. Each node owns and provides services for some disks, tapes, network links, database partitions, or other resources. In case of node failure, the disks of one node may failover to an adjacent node—but at any instant, only one node is accessing the disks. The following illustration shows a shared-nothing cluster.</P>

<P CLASS="t">Proprietary shared-nothing cluster solutions have been available for several years from Tandem, Teradata, and IBM Sysplex. These solutions all depend on exotic hardware and software and are therefore expensive.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft SQL Server and Windows NT Server clusters will bring scalability and fault tolerance to the commodity marketplace. Microsoft is building clustering technology directly into the Windows NT Server operating system. This technology will work well with commodity servers and interconnects—and it will be able to leverage special hardware accelerators from vendors like Compaq, Digital, and Tandem. Microsoft BackOffice products such as Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), and Microsoft Exchange Server, will be enhanced to take advantage of this clustering support. Many third-party products are also being ported to this architecture.</P></BODY></HTML>
