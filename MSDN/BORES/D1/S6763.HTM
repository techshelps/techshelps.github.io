<H2 CLASS="h1">Cluster Architecture</H2><P CLASS="t">A cluster is a set of loosely coupled, independent computer systems that behave as a single system. The nodes of a cluster can be single-processor systems, or they can be SMP hardware systems. The nodes can be connected by a commodity network or by a proprietary very-high-speed communications bus. The computers in a cluster cooperate so that clients see the cluster as if it were a single, very-high-performance, highly reliable server. Because the cluster is modular, it can be scaled incrementally and at low cost by adding servers, disks, and by networking.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows NT Server clusters provide horizontal growth, or<B> </B>scale out, allowing customers to add processing, storage, and network services to a preexisting configuration. A cluster can also be grown using super-server SMP nodes, but usually it is built with commodity components and commodity interconnects. Two interconnects are used for fault tolerance.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Cluster architectures allow you to scale up to larger than a single SMP node. When demand exceeds the ability of commodity SMP nodes, or when fault tolerance demands a second failover server, it is attractive to use multiple nodes to form a cluster.</P></BODY></HTML>
