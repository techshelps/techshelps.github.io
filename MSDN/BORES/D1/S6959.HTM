<H3 CLASS="h2">Turning AutoANSItoOEM On or Off</H3><P CLASS="t">When you develop applications for client sites, taking character conversion into account is very important. Data that was perfectly legible and correct when you programmed it on your ANSI 1252 client might become gibberish when saved to a server (ANSI or OEM) and viewed on an OEM 437 client. DB-Library allows you to decide whether or not ASCII values for characters will be converted between ANSI and OEM so that characters remain intact from code page to code page.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Registry entry AutoANSItoOEM can be turned on or off by selecting or clearing the <B>Automatic ANSI to OEM</B> check box in the DB Library window of the SQL Client Configuration Utility. In SQL Server 6.5, the <B>Automatic ANSI to OEM</B> check box is selected by default. </P></BODY></HTML>
