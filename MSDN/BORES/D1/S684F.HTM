<H2 CLASS="h1">Test Task</H2><P CLASS="t">For testing purposes, it is often helpful to attempt a simple task separate from other tasks you have created. The following task may be useful in debugging SQL Executive issues:</P>
<P CLASS="ls">On the <B>Server</B> menu in SQL Enterprise Manager, click <B>Scheduled Tasks</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Click <B>New Task</B> and create a new task with the following attributes:</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">Name:         Testdump</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">Type:         TSQL</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">Database:     Pubs</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">Command:     dump database pubs to diskdump</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">Schedule:     On demand</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Click <B>Add</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1"><B>Note</B>   You must execute this task from the <B>msdb</B> database.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Click <B>Testdump</B> and then click <B>Run Task</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Click <B>Task History</B> to see if the task was successful. You may need to click <B>Refresh</B> once or twice to get the display to update properly.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">You may also want to try this statement in ISQL/w to verify that you have entered it correctly and that it works as expected:</P>
<P>sp_runtask Testdump</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="lt1">This statement takes a maximum of 4 seconds to execute, so the response between start and completion, that is, success or failure, will be obvious within a few seconds. Again, you may need to click <B>Refresh</B> in the <B>Task History</B> box once or twice to update the display.</P></BODY></HTML>
