<H3 CLASS="h2">Developing Corporate Intranets</H3><P CLASS="t">Intranets let colleagues work together whether they're around the corner or around the globe. While exact figures are hard to come by, industry analysts estimate intranet Web sites outnumber Internet Web sites ten-to-one—an amazing growth rate considering there were no intranets three years ago!</P>
<P CLASS="t">To support this shift, Microsoft is making internal business use of the active Internet a key strategic focus. For example, on the desktop, Microsoft is making Windows clients (Windows 95 and Windows NT Workstation) the best active Internet clients by designing Internet capabilities into the operating systems themselves. Microsoft has enhanced Office—the leading choice in business productivity software—so that Office tools serve as Web creation tools. Microsoft has also offered free viewers, which let users read Office documents, even if they don't have Office installed on their local PCs. Microsoft has integrated the Web protocols TCP/IP and HTTP into its Windows NT Server platform, allowing Internet users to share, search, and use Web pages and documents the same way they use files and applications on a LAN. With SQL Server 6.5, Microsoft is extending its industry-leading distributed client/server database to be the best engine for corporate intranet applications.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Business applications on corporate intranets have the same requirements for security and integrity as their Internet counterparts. Organizations developing and deploying intranet applications are benefiting from the same proven technologies—user and application security, data integrity and concurrency controls, datastream encryption, data replication, and transparent distributed transactions technologies—that make Microsoft SQL Server the best platform for conducting business on the Internet.</P></BODY></HTML>
