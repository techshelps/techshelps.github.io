<H2 CLASS="h1">Overview of DB-Library</H2><P CLASS="t">DB-Library consists of over 180 functions that allow your application to communicate with SQL Server. The following illustration shows the basic structure of every DB-Library program. Most DB-Library programs only use between 10 and 15 functions.</P>
<P CLASS="a"><img src="bokdlib.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">Communication between the client applications and SQL Server are managed by using a DBPROCESS structure as follows:</P>
<P CLASS="ls"><B>dbopen</B> allocates and initializes the DBPROCESS structure. The user name, password, application name, and other "per connection" parameters are stored in the login record.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Login records are created by calling <B>dblogin</B>. Since you now have a connection to SQL Server, you can start sending SQL statements.</P>
<P CLASS="ls"><B>dbcmd</B> copies the SQL statement into the command buffer.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">The statement is not actually sent across the network to the server until <B>dbsqlexec</B> is called. At this point the SQL statement is compiled, optimized, and executed. SQL Server can return multiple result sets if multiple SQL statements were sent in a single batch or stored procedure.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">To retrieve the result set, call <B>dbresults</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Each row in the current result set is fetched by calling <B>dbnextrow</B> until <B>dbnextrow</B> returns NO_MORE_ROWS. This process is repeated by calling <B>dbresults</B> until it returns NO_MORE_RESULTS. NO_MORE_RESULTS means that you have processed every SQL statement in the command batch or stored procedure.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">When the application is finished, you can close your connection by calling <B>dbclose</B>. This will deallocate the DBPROCESS on the server and release the resources it held on the server.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">The client application can now terminate by calling <B>exit</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SQL Server calls a function in your application whenever it needs to send a message to the client or notify the client of an error. These functions are installed with <B>dberrhandle </B>and<B> dbmsghandle</B> and are not shown in the illustration.</P></BODY></HTML>
