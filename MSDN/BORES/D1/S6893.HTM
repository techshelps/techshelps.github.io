<H3 CLASS="h2">Moving Data to the Warehouse</H3><P CLASS="t">The following three steps must be performed to move data into the warehouse:</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Extract the data from the source database(s).</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Load the data into the data warehouse.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Process the data in the data warehouse.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft SQL Server has three extraction, or transfer and processing, tools you can use to move data to the warehouse:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Bulk Copy Program (<B>bcp</B>) Utility
<P CLASS="lt1">The <B>bcp</B> utility is a command-prompt utility that can be used to extract data from the OLTP database and load it into the data warehouse database. The <B>bcp</B> utility will extract and load ASCII data quickly, but it will not process data once it reaches the data warehouse, and it is not as flexible as either of the other two options.</P></LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">SQL Enterprise Manager
<P CLASS="lt1">SQL Enterprise Manager can be use to extract data from the OLTP database and load it into the data warehouse database (on the <B>Tools</B> menu, click <B>Database/Object Transfer</B>). Because it is a graphical tool, it is somewhat easier to use than the other two options, but it is an interactive tool and needs an operator present for certain steps. Like <B>bcp</B>, it does not process data once it reaches the data warehouse.</P></LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">SQL Distributed Management Objects
<P CLASS="lt1">SQL Distributed Management Objects (SQL-DMO) can be used to write a script that will extract data from the OLTP database, load it into the data warehouse, and process it in the data warehouse. Provided you can program using SQL-DMO, this is the most flexible and complete way to move data into the warehouse.</P></LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">There are also third-party software products developed to extract, transform, and transfer data from source data systems that generate input data to populate a Microsoft SQL Server data warehouse. </P></BODY></HTML>
