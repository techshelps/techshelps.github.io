<H3 CLASS="h2">Availability by Using Fault Tolerance</H3><P CLASS="t">By partitioning data and work, clusters provide firewalls that limit the scope of failures. When a node fails, the other cluster nodes continue to deliver service. By replicating data or by allowing storage and network devices to fail over to surviving nodes, the cluster can provide uninterrupted service.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Commodity SMP hardware systems are logical building blocks for clusters. Availability, scalability, and economics demand that large systems be built as arrays of these commodity components. SMP hardware systems provide vertical growth of nodes from single-processor systems to large SMP hardware systems. Clusters provide horizontal growth by combining these SMP hardware systems into Windows NT Server clusters.</P></BODY></HTML>
