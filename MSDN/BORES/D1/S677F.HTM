<H3 CLASS="h2">Automated Web Publishing of Database Information</H3><P CLASS="t">SQL Server Web Assistant, one of the new Internet extensions available in SQL Server 6.5, provides the ability to easily and automatically generate Web pages formatted in HTML. Used in conjunction with an appropriate Web server product, the Web Assistant publishes Microsoft SQL Server–based information from anywhere in an organization.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The Web Assistant uses a step by step, wizard-like interface that walks a DBA or Webmaster through the process of creating a query, formatting output, and scheduling the query execution, making it easy for customers to create interactive, database-driven Web sites with automated information content. Using a data "push" model, the Web Assistant automatically publishes information out of a SQL Server database directly to the Web page. The data can be updated automatically: on a regularly scheduled basis or whenever relevant data changes. The data remains accessible to any existing client/server application as well as to the Web. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The Web Assistant is particularly valuable when publishing large amounts of database information that will be the same for all visitors to a Web site, such as price lists, inventory, or online catalogs. The Web Assistant is helpful in publishing time-sensitive or dynamic data that users need to view in real-time, like stock quote information. The Web Assistant is resource-efficient, executing the query only once, regardless of how many people visit the page.</P></BODY></HTML>
