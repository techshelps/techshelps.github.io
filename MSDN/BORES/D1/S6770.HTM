<H3 CLASS="h2">Scalable Windows NT Server Management</H3><P CLASS="t">Managing the software and hardware configurations of thousands of clients is probably the most challenging task of operating large client/server systems. Windows NT Server and Microsoft System Management Server automate many of these tasks.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows NT Server security provides a domain concept and a single logon password for each application running on Windows NT Server. Windows NT Server security also provides user groups. Large user populations can be managed by authorizing groups and adding users to groups. The Windows NT Server security mechanism works as a collection of security servers (domain controllers) spread among the network nodes. This distribution provides both scalability and availability. Individual domains have been scaled to over 40,000 users. Windows NT Server security scales beyond that size by partitioning into a multidomain architecture with trust relationships among domains. The security system has both a programmatic and an intuitive graphical interface that allows any node to manage the network security.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft System Management Server (SMS) allows a single system administrator to manage the software configuration, licensing, and upgrades of tens of thousands of clients. SMS automates most tasks and minimizes exception situations that require an expert. To give another example, Windows NT Server DHCP protocol automatically assigns TCP/IP addresses to nodes on demand, eliminating time-consuming and error-prone tasks, allowing node mobility, and conserving the address pool.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Windows NT Server has built-in tools to log errors, manage disk space, set priorities, and monitor system performance. All these tools can manage a cluster of client and server nodes. The following illustration shows the performance monitor at one node tracking the CPU and network use of several nodes.</P>
<P CLASS="a"><img src="perfmon.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">Each Windows NT Server node has over 500 performance counters for its internal behavior. Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, and many other products ported to Windows NT Server integrate with this performance monitor. Microsoft SQL Server adds over 75 performance counters to this and integrates with the Windows NT Server event log to announce events.</P></BODY></HTML>
