<H2 CLASS="h1">Scalability and Manageability</H2><P CLASS="t">Performance is only a small part of the cost of ownership. System management and operation is often more expensive than the hardware and software. Larger systems can be difficult to design, program, administer, and operate. The following issues are important for small systems, but they become <I>very</I> important when the systems scale up:</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Manageability</B>—A scalable system should automate periodic and repetitive system management tasks. Operators should only be involved in exception situations that require administrative decisions. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Continuous availability</B>—The cost of downtime increases with system size. Paradoxically, larger systems have more components and are therefore more likely to break. Scalable systems must deliver continuous availability. They must allow online operations (backup, recovery, reorganization, upgrades), and must mask hardware and software failures with automatic failover to another server.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Price/performance of commodity hardware</B>—Any solution must use cost-effective hardware platforms. Approaches based on specialized architectures are increasingly less economic.</P></BODY></HTML>
