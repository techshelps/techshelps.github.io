<H3 CLASS="h2">An Application for Testing Load Balance</H3><P CLASS="t">You can create a test that helps determine the best strategies for load balancing a SQL Server system for optimum performance.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When you are working with Visual Basic to create a new database system, you may find that you frequently start and stop the SQL Server and rebuild a database from scratch, perhaps with only a few changes. Visual Basic is an ideal platform for writing a test-harness (a set of simultaneous processes derived from a typical real-time system). The test-harness application can initiate simultaneous user applications or use a script to simulate the keystrokes and mouse movements of an end user. This type of application is similar to a SQL script.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The SQL-DMO application contains code for all the objects that make up the database to drop, create, and insert into a collection. These objects include tables, indexes, columns, users, views, triggers, options, and configurations. You can test stored procedures using the <B>ExecuteImmediate </B>or <B>ExecuteWithResults</B> method, or you can simulate multiple instances of an application using the Visual Basic Shell command.</P></BODY></HTML>
