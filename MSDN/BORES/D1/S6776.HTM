<H3 CLASS="h2">Conducting Business on the Internet</H3><P CLASS="t">Many organizations are already realizing the benefits of connecting existing business systems to the Internet. By automating the communication and processes between customers and suppliers, businesses become more efficient. However, electronic commerce is progressing more slowly than expected. Fewer than 10 percent of Internet users make regular online purchases. The biggest deterrents to conducting business on the Internet are data integrity and security.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Security on the Internet is vital for both extending the enterprise and conducting electronic commerce. The industry has focused on defining technologies and industry standards to secure the communications between Web servers and browsers. Technologies and standards include encryption, secure transaction, user authentication, and signed-code or digital signatures. Microsoft and its partners have participated in the development of several important new technology standards, including Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), a secure protocol providing data encryption, server authentication, and message integrity for a TCP/IP connection, and Secure Electronic Transactions (SET), a technical standard for safeguarding payment-card purchases made over open networks like the Internet.</P>
<P CLASS="t">While these are critical components in providing a secure environment for conducting business on the Internet, they only address part of the security problem. Looking at traditional client/server environments gives insight into other security issues. Controlling user or application access to information is a fundamental security requirement of any business application. Data and transaction integrity are also critical in any multiuser business environment, ensuring that all transactions are either fully completed or are rolled back so that every user's view of data is consistent and reliable.</P>
<P CLASS="t">These security and integrity issues were solved for traditional business applications years ago by Microsoft SQL Server technologies like user and application security, data integrity and concurrency controls, datastream encryption, data replication, and transparent distributed transactions. Solving these issues for the Internet doesn't require new technology. Applying SQL Server technology to the Internet gives you proven solutions to the challenges of data security and integrity. </P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec0"></A>Controlling User and Application Security</H4><P CLASS="t">Both Internet and intranet servers need to augment anonymous user control with specific per-user and per-group access control. Both Microsoft Internet Information Server and Microsoft SQL Server build on the Windows NT Server security model to deliver Internet-specific security features like control over anonymous access, network-  or host-based access, and secure Internet authentication.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Consider a group of intranet users who have been given access to a particular Web site. With client authentication, users can identify themselves to Internet Information Server and gain access to those directories and files marked as readable only by the group. Because the user-accounts database of Windows NT Server is full-featured, any number of overlapping groups can be created and granted differing access to resources on the server. Taking this a step further—if they're authenticated by Windows NT server, they are also authenticated to SQL Server so you don't have to maintain multiple security databases.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec1"></A>Replicating Rich Text and Graphical Content</H4><P CLASS="t">Microsoft SQL Server replication answers the traditional client/server challenge of distributing and synchronizing information throughout an organization, while guaranteeing integrity and reliability. Replication solves a similar set of problems for Internet and intranet sites—allowing Webmasters to manage and synchronize multiple copies of published information. Replication also allows an organization to avoid exposing sensitive database information on an intranet by selectively replicating data from production SQL Servers to a Web-connected SQL Server. SQL Server 6.5 can replicate complex text and image data popular on Web sites.</P>
<H4 CLASS="h3"><A NAME="sec2"></A>Integrating Legacy Systems</H4><P CLASS="t">Most medium-to-large companies today have significant investments in their information systems infrastructure. Information is stored in a variety of different and often incompatible database management systems. The vast majority of these legacy systems provide no integration with the Internet. With Microsoft SQL Server–compatible middleware solutions like Microsoft TransAccess&reg; or Information Builders EDA/Open Database Gateway, customers can integrate data across the enterprise onto the Internet.</P></BODY></HTML>
