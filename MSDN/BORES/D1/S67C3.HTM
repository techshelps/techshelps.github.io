<H2 CLASS="h1">Publishing Snapshots of Database Information</H2><P CLASS="t">Sometimes you may need to make available to many individuals in your organization information stored in your SQL Server databases. These individuals may not have the appropriate client-side applications installed. A logical solution to this dilemma is to extract information from the database and publish it on your company intranet.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In this type of situation, the data owner or database administrator determines what information to publish, and when to publish it. Users need to view database information, but don't need to alter database records. The results of one query or report are published to many people to save the time of running the query again and again, to reduce the risk of running the wrong query, or to reduce the performance impact that multiple queries would have on the database server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft makes three products that address this issue: </P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">SQL Workbook Publisher </LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The Web Wizard component of Microsoft Access 97</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">The SQL Server Web Assistant component of Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 </LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">Each extends Microsoft's database software by effectively converting query results into HTML pages. Each creates Web pages that any Web server can publish and any Web client can browse.</P>
