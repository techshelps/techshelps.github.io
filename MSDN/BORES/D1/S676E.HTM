<H2 CLASS="h1">Database Failover</H2><P CLASS="t">Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 offers fault-tolerance and high availability by providing failover from one server to another when the first server fails or needs to be taken out of service for maintenance.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The failover mechanism works as follows: Two Windows NT Servers can be configured as dual servers. The pair must have shared access to a SQL Server database stored on shared disks. One of the Microsoft SQL Servers is the primary server. It accepts requests from clients and both reads from and writes to the database. The following illustration shows the primary and secondary server setup before a failure on server one.</P>

<P CLASS="t">The other Microsoft SQL Server node (the failover) can provide access to other databases, but it is not accessing the database being managed by the primary server. The following illustration shows the secondary server taking over after a failure on the primary server.</P>
<P CLASS="a"><img src="BOK0125b.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">If the primary server fails, Windows NT Server at the failover server takes ownership of the disks holding the database. It informs the failover server that it is now the primary server. The failover server recovers the database and begins accepting client connections. For their part, clients connect to the failover server when the primary server fails.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The dual-server failover is completely automatic. The whole process of detecting and recovering from failure takes only a few minutes. When the primary server is repaired, it is restarted and either becomes the new failover server, or assumes primary server responsibilities again.</P></BODY></HTML>
