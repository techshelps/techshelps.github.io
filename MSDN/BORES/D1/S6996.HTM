<H2 CLASS="h1">Deadlock Demonstration</H2><P CLASS="t">This demonstration shows how two tasks can deadlock each other by acquiring locks on a table in the incorrect order. More importantly, it shows how they can eliminate the deadlock simply by changing the order in which they acquire locks.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The file Deadlock.sql creates tables and stored procedures to support the demonstration. A user can then run some simple queries in ISQL/w to exhibit a deadlock problem and a solution to that problem.</P></BODY></HTML>
