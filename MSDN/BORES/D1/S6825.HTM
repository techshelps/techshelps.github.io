<H3 CLASS="h2">Windows NT File System Selection</H3><P CLASS="t">Internal testing at Microsoft has shown that there is very little difference in SQL Server performance between NTFS and FAT file systems. In general, NTFS is faster than FAT for reads and slightly slower for writes, since it performs transaction logging for recoverability. The SQL Server TPC-B benchmarks published by Compaq used NTFS for the database devices and FAT for the log, since logging is write-intensive.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B>   Both NTFS and FAT support Windows NT–based striping.</P></BODY></HTML>
