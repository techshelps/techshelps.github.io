<H2 CLASS="h1">Future Direction</H2><P CLASS="t">Microsoft continues to enhance SQL-DMO as a development tool. SQL-DMO will continue to support SQL Server features. For example, when new SQL Server features are added to replication, new SQL-DMO objects or methods will be created to represent these new features.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SQL-DMO will also continue to support the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM). The COM standard has recently introduced the Distributed COM component, which supports simultaneous calls from local or remote clients. Future releases of SQL-DMO will include Distributed COM components. </P></BODY></HTML>
