<H2 CLASS="h1">Rebuilding the Registry for SQL Server</H2><P CLASS="t">To rebuild the SQL Server registry entries, open a command prompt. The following commands will run the Setup program to rebuild the Registry. </P>
<P CLASS="t">The options to the Setup program are case-sensitive and must be typed exactly as shown. Also, a space must be on both sides of the equal sign (=). This example assumes that SQL Server version 6.5 was installed on drive C:.</P>

<PRE>cd \mssql\binn<BR>   setup /t RegistryRebuild = On<BR></PRE>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B>   You can use <B>= On</B> or<B> = True</B> for the <B>setup</B> line. </P>
<P CLASS="t">You now must answer the questions exactly as you did during installation. The Setup program will reinsert all of the entries into the Registry but will not install or change any files. </P>
<P CLASS="t">If SQL Server was set up to use integrated security, you will need to re-add all of the users and groups by using the SQL Security Manager. You should re-add all of the groups and users that you had previously added. The SQL Security Manager will recognize that the users already exist in SQL Server and will not modify SQL Server but will go ahead and add the necessary security entries in Windows NT. </P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B>   If you reinstalled Windows NT because you were changing the domain for an Advanced Server, you will need to delete and re-add the users in SQL Server because the default domain name has changed and will cause the user name mapping to fail.</P></BODY></HTML>
