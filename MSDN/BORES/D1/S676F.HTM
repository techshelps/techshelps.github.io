<H2 CLASS="h1">Microsoft SQL Server and Windows NT Server Manageability</H2><P CLASS="t">It is relatively easy to build huge systems. Microsoft provides easy installation of the operating system and database using graphical tools and wizards. SQL Server also includes wizards to set up database management.</P>
<P CLASS="t">However, because these systems involve thousands of client systems and huge databases, manageability is a real challenge. Managing and operating a computer system has always been a major part of the cost-of-ownership. When hardware and software prices plummet, the residual management cost becomes even more significant. Loading, dumping, and reorganizing 100 GB databases is a challenge. At the 3 MB/sec data rate of most tape drives, it takes a day and a half just to dump a 100 GB database with one tape drive. Defining and managing the security attributes of 5,000 different users is a daunting task. Configuring the hardware and software for 5,000 clients is another time-consuming task.</P></BODY></HTML>
