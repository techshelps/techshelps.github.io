<H2 CLASS="h1">Differences in SQL Behavior Between ODBC, ISQL, DB-Library, and SQL Enterprise Manager </H2><P CLASS="t">When you use the ODBC drivers that ship with SQL Server version 6.0 or later, SQL Server commands sometimes may appear to work differently in ODBC clients from how they work in either DB-Library clients or the SQL Server client utilities, such as <B>isql</B>, ISQL/w, and the Enterprise Manager query analyzer window. In most cases, these differences are simply due to options set by the Microsoft ODBC SQL Server driver using the Transact-SQL SET command, and if the same options are set in the DB-Library clients, they exhibit the same behavior as the ODBC driver.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The ODBC standard is closely matched to the ANSI SQL standard, and ODBC applications expect the behavior of an ODBC driver to match the standard behavior. In order to make its behavior conform more closely with that defined in the ODBC standard, the Microsoft ODBC SQL Server driver version 2.50.0121 always issues the following Transact-SQL SET commands.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When you connect to SQL Server version 4.21a:</P>

<PRE>SET TEXTSIZE 2147483647
SET ARITHABORT ON
</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">When you connect to SQL Server version 6.0:</P>

<PRE>SET ANSI_NULL_DFLT_ON ON
SET TEXTSIZE 2147483647
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
SET ARITHABORT ON
</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">The 2.65.0201 driver, which ships with SQL Server 6.5, will set the same options when connecting to version 4.21a and 6.0 servers. When the 2.65.0201 driver connects to a SQL Server 6.5 server, it will set the following options: </P>

<PRE>SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
SET TEXTSIZE 2147483647
SET ANSI_DEFAULTS ON
SET CURSOR_CLOSE_ON_COMMIT OFF
SET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS OFF
</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">The Microsoft ODBC SQL Server driver issues these commands itself; the ODBC application does nothing to request them. Setting these options allows ODBC applications using the driver to be more portable, because the driver's behavior then matches that defined by the standard.</P>
<P CLASS="t">ODBC applications should not change these SET options, except for the three exceptions discussed in the following paragraph. Not only does the driver depend on these options to comply with the ODBC standard behavior, it also assumes that these options are set when it generates SQL commands that it sends to the server. For example, the driver may put double quotation marks around object names in its generated SQL statements to handle objects created using quoted identifiers, and whose names are only legal if enclosed in quotation marks. If the application has turned off the QUOTED_IDENTIFIER option, then these generated SQL commands will get syntax errors from the server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">ODBC applications using the 2.65.0201 or 2.65.0213 drivers can turn off three of the ANSI options normally set on by the driver. They are:</P>

<PRE>SET ANSI_NULLS OFF
SET ANSI_PADDING OFF
SET ANSI_WARNINGS OFF
</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">The application can do this by simply executing the appropriate SET command, for example:</P>

<PRE>SQLExecDirect(hstmt, "SET ANSI_NULLS OFF", SQL_NTS);
</PRE>
<P CLASS="t">If the code affected by the ANSI options is in a stored procedure, the appropriate SET commands can alternatively be added at the top of the stored procedure. In this case, the ANSI option would be turned off during the execution of the stored procedure, then return to the setting requested by the client when the procedure quits. This would allow the procedure writer to control the environment in the procedure without affecting the general settings requested by each client.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The 2.65.0240 driver that ships with SQL Server 6.5 Service Pack 2 gives users greater control over what specific ANSI options are set by the driver. When a user defines a data source using the 2.65.0240 driver, there is a check box for turning on or off the setting of QUOTED_IDENTIFIERS, and another for turning on or off ANSI_NULLS, ANSI_PADDING, and ANSI_WARNINGS. Users can also set these options on or off when creating a data source through <B>SQLConfigDataSource</B>. In addition, the 2.65.0240 driver supports driver-specific connection options to control these at connect time. See the SQL Server 6.5 Service Pack 2 Readme.txt for more details. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Before assuming that there is a true difference in behavior between the Microsoft ODBC SQL Server driver and DB-Library applications, you should run the DB-Library test with the same SET options as you use with the ODBC driver.</P></BODY></HTML>
