<H3 CLASS="h2">A Customized Interface for Replication</H3><P CLASS="t">You can create a replication interface that automates the process of setting up replication and that provides the user with additional information about the SQL Server installations.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To create a replication interface, you set up a publisher and a subscriber, and then you create publications. To set up a publisher, you set the SQLServer object's distribution properties and use the RemoteServer object and its <B>SetOptions</B> method to allow remote servers to subscribe. To set up a subscriber you use the RemoteServer's <B>SetOptions</B> method to subscribe to a remote server. You can add new Publication, Article, and Subscription objects to the relevant collection and then use the RemoteServer's <B>Subscribe</B> method to start replicating data. The RemoteServer object's SubscriberInfo object stores information that relates to the distribution schedule. The interface, created with Visual Basic, can be used to control the creation and management of the replication objects.</P></BODY></HTML>
