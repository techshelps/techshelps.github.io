<P CLASS="t">This article provides guidelines for proper backup and recovery of SQL Server databases running in production environments. Too often, customers have suffered hardware or other failures, and only then realized that either they did not have backups, or that their backups were done improperly, resulting in unnecessary loss of valuable data. As with any of the information included in this Resource Guide, you should still read and thoroughly understand those chapters pertaining to backup and recovery in the documentation provided with Microsoft SQL Server.</P></BODY></HTML>
