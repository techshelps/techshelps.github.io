<H2 CLASS="h1">Using a Browser as a Database Front End</H2><P CLASS="t">The two-fold challenge of frequently changing data and heavy demand for information becomes even more complex when many users don't have time to install and learn custom database applications. Management of data can be streamlined if you empower users to interact with the database on their terms, that is, with Web browsers. </P>
<P CLASS="t">In this type of situation, users need such a variety of information, or the information changes so rapidly, that you can't feasibly extract and publish it as snapshots. Additionally, users need to update, as well as view, database records.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can use the Internet Database Connector (IDC) component of Internet Information Server (IIS). This extends Microsoft Web server software by providing links between IIS and any ODBC data source. It requires Windows NT Server 3.51 SP4 or later, and works with any Web browser software.</P>
<P CLASS="t"><B>Note</B>   Another tool, Visual FoxPro&trade; WWW Search Page Wizard, is available from the Microsoft Web site (version 4 product) or is supplied with the version 5 product. This tool is not discussed here because it is not a SQL Server solution.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following illustration shows how users access a database with IDC.</P>
<P CLASS="a"><img src="bok714b.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="ls">From the BackOffice Resource Kit CD-ROM install IIS on a Windows NT Server computer.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Use a text editor to create two files: an .htx file and an .idc file.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">An .htx file contains HTML code that will be merged with the results of database queries. An .idc file contains the name of the ODBC data source that contains the data you want to make accessible, SQL statements that extract information or update records, and a reference to the .htx file.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">Add a link that references the .idc file to an existing Web page.</P>
<P CLASS="t">When a user selects this link, IIS notifies IDC. IDC checks the appropriate .idc file to locate the ODBC data source, sends the SQL statements, and receives the results. IDC merges the results with the .htx file to create a new Web page, and IIS sends the new page to the browser.</P></BODY></HTML>
