<H2 CLASS="h1">Scalability Growth</H2><P CLASS="t">As organizations grow and acquire more and more data, they must deal with increased transaction workloads and larger databases. Each major increment presents new challenges.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Scalability includes several kinds of growth:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1"><B>User population and network</B>—If the user population doubles, the network and database workload probably does too.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"><B>Database size</B>—With databases commonly reaching hundreds of gigabytes, operations, such as backup, restore, and load, can all become bottlenecks.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"><B>Transaction complexity</B>—Application designers are building more intelligence into applications, relieving users of tedious tasks. Increasingly, applications are used for data mining and data analysis.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"><B>Applications</B>—As applications become easier and less expensive to build, organizations are using computers in new ways. These new applications increase the load on existing databases and servers.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1"><B>Numbers of servers</B>—Clustered and distributed applications involve many nodes. Scalable systems allow a large number of nodes to be easily managed from a single location.</LI></UL></SPAN></BODY></HTML>
