<H2 CLASS="h1">Star-Schema Design</H2><P CLASS="t">Each DSS database, housing a few tables, is termed a data warehouse. The most popular design technique for this type of database is called dimensional modeling, or a star schema. </P>
<P CLASS="t">A star schema is made of two types of tables: fact tables and dimension tables. Fact tables are rows of indexed facts, usually numeric values. Dimension tables are denormalized descriptions of the facts. Fact tables and dimension tables are united by dimensional keys. Dimensional keys, like primary keys, are unique identifiers that connect a row in a fact table with one specific dimensional table. An optimal data warehouse database has long, thin fact tables and small, short, wide dimension tables. The following illustration depicts a simple warehouse star-schema model with one fact table and four dimensions. Some star-schema designs have as many as 25 to 30 dimensions and multiple fact tables.</P>
<P CLASS="a"><img src="star1.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">The time table (<B>Time_Table</B>) is one of the distinguishing characteristics of the dimensional model. Functions relating to time are very important for decision support. For example, this fiscal year a marketing executive at a major flower distribution company has a reduced budget and must determine when to launch an ad campaign. She wants to compare sales of roses during the last three Christmas seasons with the sales of roses on February 14 and Mother's Day last year to determine how to best spend her advertising dollars.</P>
<P CLASS="t">As the following illustration shows, the marketer's decision support query would access information from the fact table, in this case sales (<B>Sales_Table</B>), and the four dimensions of store (<B>Store_Dimension</B>), time (<B>Time_Dimension</B>), product (<B>Product_Dimension</B>), and order (<B>Order_Dimension</B>).</P>
<P CLASS="a"><img src="star2.gif"></P>
<P CLASS="t">Using the <B>Store_Dimension</B>, the marketer will determine the regions that are most lucrative. The <B>Month</B> entity of the <B>Time_Dimension</B> will indicate when buyers are most likely to buy flowers. The most popular breed of roses will be evident from <B>Product_desc</B> in the <B>Product_Dimension</B>. Also, the marketer may choose to work with a particular credit card company in promoting flowers if many customers charge flowers to credit, as evidenced by the <B>Payment_type</B> entity in <B>Order_Dimension</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Standard SQL is limited to date arithmetic and date comparison. Databases used for data warehousing must be able to perform more complicated time calculations, including:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Time aggregation (the particular weeks that add up to the second quarter of the flower distributor's fiscal year).</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Calendar conversion (ability to calculate leap year every fourth year).</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Automatic conversions for data having different time valuations (for example, monthly advertising expenditures versus yearly sales).</LI></UL></SPAN></BODY></HTML>
