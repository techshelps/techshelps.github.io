<H3 CLASS="h2">Quick Tips Strategy Summary </H3><P CLASS="t">SQL Server is capable of very high performance on large databases. To achieve this performance potential, you must use efficient database, index, query, and application design. These areas are the best candidates for obtaining significant performance improvement. Try to make each query as efficient as possible, so that when your application scales up to more users, the collective multiuser load is supportable. It is recommended that you study the client application behavior, the queries submitted by the application, and experiment with indexes using the guidelines in this document. A methodical approach in analyzing performance problems will often yield significant improvement for relatively little time investment.</P></BODY></HTML>
