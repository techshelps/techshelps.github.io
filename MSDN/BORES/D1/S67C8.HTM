<H2 CLASS="h1">Microsoft SQL Server Internet Connector</H2><P CLASS="t">The SQL Server Internet Connector is an add-on product that allows an unlimited number of Internet and intranet connections to a single SQL Server. You must purchase a license pack called the Microsoft SQL Server Internet Connector to legally use Microsoft SQL Server with a Web server. This is required regardless of whether the Web server is IIS or a third-party product, whether the Web server runs on Windows NT Server or another operating system, whether the Web server is on the Internet or your company intranet, or whether the access is performed by a service like IDC or dbWeb, or by other methods, such as Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts. </P>
<P CLASS="t">A single SQL Server Internet Connector applies to one SQL Server only; it is a one-to-one relationship. It permits an unlimited number of computers or workstations to access the services of a single server running Microsoft SQL Server. You don't need to acquire a separate Client Access License for each computer or workstation, provided access to the server is available only through a Web server. An unlimited number of Web servers can legally access any single SQL Server that has SQL Server Internet Connector.</P>
<P CLASS="t">With the purchase of the SQL Server Internet Connector and the appropriate number of Client Access Licenses, any single SQL Server can simultaneously support Internet user access and standard client/server access. The purchase of Client Access Licenses is independent of the purchase of the SQL Server Internet Connector. Client Access Licenses are always required for each concurrent client/server user. The SQL Server Internet Connector is a special license for database connections through a Web server only.</P></BODY></HTML>
