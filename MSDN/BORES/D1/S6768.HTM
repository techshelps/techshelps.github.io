<H2 CLASS="h1">Scalability Architecture</H2><P CLASS="t">Microsoft SQL Server makes full use of Windows NT Server SMP capabilities: threads and the Windows NT Server scheduler. Each Windows NT Server node typically has a single Microsoft SQL Server address space managing all the SQL databases at that node. SQL Server runs as a main address space with several pools of threads. Some threads are dedicated to housekeeping tasks like logging, buffer-pool management, servicing operation requests, and monitoring the system. A second larger pool of threads performs user requests. These threads execute stored procedures or SQL statements requested by the clients. The following diagram illustrates this architecture.</P>

<P CLASS="t">Microsoft SQL Server is typically used in a client/server environment where clients on other computers connect to the server and issue either SQL requests or stored procedures usually written in the Transact-SQL language. Clients can also be located at the server node. Microsoft SQL Server uses a built-in TP-monitor utility, Open Data Services, to support large numbers of clients. In practice, this has scaled to 5,000 concurrent clients. Beyond that size, it makes sense to either partition the application into a cluster of nodes, or use another TP monitor to connect clients to SQL Server. All common TP monitors, such as CICS, Encina, Tuxedo, and Top End, have been ported to Windows NT Server and interface with Microsoft SQL Server.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft SQL Server achieves near-linear speedup on SMP machines. Many benchmarks have demonstrated this. Two notable examples are the DEC Alpha TPC-C benchmark and the Intergraph benchmark.</P></BODY></HTML>
