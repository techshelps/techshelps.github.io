<H3 CLASS="h2">Database Design Strategy Summary</H3><P CLASS="t">The goal is to develop as optimal a logical database design as possible, before physical implementation of the database, to minimize database tuning during later stages of the SQL Server solution development process. To attain this goal, you must apply your knowledge of the user and application requirements to efficiently balance between a normalized and denormalized data model. The end result should save space and time with regard to performance. Therefore, when creating physical tables, remember that the data type associated with each table column should reflect the smallest storage necessary for the required data. This results in more data rows fitting on a single data page and therefore fewer I/Os.</P></BODY></HTML>
