<H3 CLASS="h2">Planning a Backup Strategy</H3><P CLASS="t">It is always a good idea to include backup strategy planning as a key component of any project. In some cases, the backup strategy may even have a large impact on the design of the application. When planning the backup strategy for a given application, answer the following questions:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">How often should backups be done?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">What will be backed up—for example, full database dumps versus transaction log dumps?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">On what medium will backups be saved: tape, floppy disk, or hard disk?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Will backups be performed while users are working or after hours?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Will backups be performed manually or automatically?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">If backups are automated, how will it be verified that they actually occurred without error?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">If a backup did not occur without error, how will it be redone?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">How long will backups be saved before reusing the storage medium?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Assuming failure, how long will it take to restore to the last backup? Is that an acceptable amount of downtime? If not, what is?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Where will backups be stored, and do the appropriate people have access to them?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Who is responsible for seeing that backups are performed and performed correctly?</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Besides the system administrator, does someone else know the proper passwords and procedures to perform backups and, if necessary, restore the backups?</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">This is by no means a complete list of all the questions you should consider when planning your backup strategy. You will need to answer these questions for every SQL Server environment, and there may be many other questions specific to your particular environment.</P></BODY></HTML>
