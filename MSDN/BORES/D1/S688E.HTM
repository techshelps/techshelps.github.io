Data warehousing is a term that usually is applied to a decision support system that models an entire entity's business and data structure. Some data marts eventually grow or merge into a data warehouse. Another approach is for large enterprises to break a large data warehouse into several data marts, which send reports back to the central data warehouse repository. Or the central data warehouse can feed the data marts their information, in which case the data marts inherit from the data warehouse its business rules, sources, and semantics.</P></BODY></HTML>
