<H2 CLASS="h1">Parallel Processing </H2><P CLASS="t">Windows NT Server was designed for SMP hardware systems. Windows NT Server is a fully threaded operating system that provides a rich set of synchronization primitives. The shrink-wrapped version of Windows NT Server is enabled for 4-way SMP. Larger SMP hardware systems are not yet a commodity product, so their operating system is generally packaged with the hardware. Companies like Digital, Intergraph, NCR, Sequent, and SGI, which build 8-way and 32-way Windows NT Server multiprocessors, modify Windows NT Server for their hardware and ship it with the hardware package.</P></BODY></HTML>
