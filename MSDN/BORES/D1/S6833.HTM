<P CLASS="t">Tuning the SQL Server solution should be much less difficult at this point since we have applied optimization guidelines throughout the solution development process. However, reality dictates that no implementation is performance perfect. Consequently, the following article consists of tuning strategies previously discussed. A prior understanding of the Windows NT Performance Monitor is required to apply some of the tuning strategies presented. </P>
<P CLASS="t">It is beyond the scope of this article to address every possible tuning situation. Therefore, only those scenarios that have the greatest impact on performance will be discussed.</P>
<P CLASS="t">All monitoring requires the use of the Windows NT Performance Monitor unless otherwise specified. In addition, all guidelines apply to dedicated SQL Server systems. However, these techniques can be applied to nondedicated SQL Server systems with only slight modification.</P></BODY></HTML>
