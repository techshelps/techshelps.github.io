<H2 CLASS="h1">SQL Workbook Publisher</H2><P CLASS="t">SQL Workbook Publisher is a Microsoft Excel 97 add-in that allows users to easily analyze data stored in Microsoft SQL Server databases. Users create workbooks that can be populated with data from SQL Server databases. SQL Workbook Publisher enables these workbooks to be saved to SQL Server databases, where they can be shared by many people within an organization. With a few mouse clicks, users can obtain data stored in a SQL Server database in a formatted Excel workbook.</P>
<P CLASS="t">SQL Workbook Publisher offers tangible benefits to every information professional in your organization: </P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Database performance can be increased by optimizing queries for frequently requested Microsoft Excel workbooks.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Workbooks created and maintained by a few individuals can be viewed by many, reducing work redundancies.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Workbooks can be viewed in Excel or on your intranet.</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Structured Query Language (SQL) is made friendlier because queries can be written and workbooks can be edited in Excel. </LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">SQL Workbook Publisher components can be installed on computers running Windows NT Server, Windows 95, or Windows NT Workstation. SQL Workbook Publisher has the following installation options:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI CLASS="ULI1">Server</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Client</LI><LI CLASS="ULI1">Intranet (optional)</LI></UL></SPAN><P CLASS="t">If a computer running Windows NT Server has SQL Server 6.5 installed, it can be used as a SQL Workbook Publisher server. When you run the Transact-SQL script that installs SQL Workbook Publisher on a computer running SQL Server, 3 tables and 14 stored procedures are installed in the SQL Server database you specify. This database also stores the Excel workbooks. Before Excel workbooks can be stored in a particular database, you must install SQL Workbook Publisher in that database. SQL Workbook Publisher can be installed in one or more databases residing on one or more servers.</P>
<P CLASS="t">A computer running Windows 95, Windows NT Server, or Windows NT Workstation must have Excel 97 installed to be a client of the SQL Workbook Publisher server. You can choose between two client installations: the Publisher and the Viewer. With the Publisher installation, you can create, edit, and view Excel workbooks. The Viewer installation allows you to only view Excel workbooks. </P>
<P CLASS="t">When the Viewer is installed on Windows 95 or Windows NT clients, only the <B>Open from SQL Server</B> command is added to the <B>File</B> menu. If the Publisher is installed on Windows 95 or Windows NT clients, three new commands are added to the <B>File</B> menu: <B>Open from SQL Server</B>, <B>Save to SQL Server</B>, and <B>Save As to SQL Server</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can also install SQL Workbook Publisher on your Microsoft Internet Information Server to enable users to browse workbooks saved on SQL Server from your corporate intranet. With Microsoft Internet Explorer, users can view existing workbooks saved on one or more SQL Workbook Publisher–enabled servers, much like they can with the Viewer installation.</P></BODY></HTML>
