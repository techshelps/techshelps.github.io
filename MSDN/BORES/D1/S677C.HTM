<H3 CLASS="h2">Fast and Easy Programming Interface</H3><P CLASS="t">Traditionally, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts have been used to add functionality (like linking forms with an SQL database) to standard HTML forms. Each field on an HTML form can require up to 25 lines of CGI script to link it with a database. This model requires a high level of up-front programming. Any modifications are extremely labor intensive, given the one-to-one correspondence between the form field and the CGI script. The lack of quality database connectivity tools is partially responsible for the slow migration of commercial and business applications to the Internet.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Microsoft has developed Internet Server APIs (ISAPIs) like Active Server Pages (ASP), Internet Database Connector (IDC), and dbWeb to counter inefficient CGI technology. When your Web server needs to process more than one transaction per minute, CGI applications have been proven to degrade performance. </P>
<P CLASS="t">IDC and SQL Server Web Assistant can be used together to integrate SQL Server with the Web.</P>
<P CLASS="t">The following illustration shows how IDC and the SQL Server Web Assistant enable seamless connectivity with SQL Server data. IDC, or the <I>pull</I> model, allows a Web user to initiate dynamic, user-driven queries to a SQL Server from within an HTML document. The SQL Server retrieves or updates information in a database. The SQL Server Web Assistant, or <I>push</I> model, allows a database administrator or Webmaster to define a set of data (a query or stored procedure) that is automatically merged into an HTML document either on a scheduled basis or when the data changes.</P>
