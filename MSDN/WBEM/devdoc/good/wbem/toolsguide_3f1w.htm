<h2><a name="_hmm_html_viewer_environment"></a>HTML Viewer Environment</h2>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
The HTML Viewer allows you to view schema class definitions on a particular machine in a network, and to view objects of those classes on that machine. The HTML Viewer displays objects from a <a href="overview_90gv.htm">CIM Object Manager (CIMOM)</a> database. You can browse the objects by selecting the classes by using the graphical or default views.</p>
<p>
Each time you use the HTML Viewer you are asked for the machine name to browse. Before you can view the classes on a particular machine, CIMOM must create a database on that machine.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;CIMOM must be installed and a database of classes must be created on the target machine prior to using the HTML Viewer. One of the methods for creating a database of classes is to compile a MOF file in the directory where the SDK was installed (typically c:\Wbem). To compile the MOF file, type the following at the command-line prompt: <b>mofcomp </b><i>&lt;filename.mof&gt;</i>. For more information, see <a href="mofcomp_3v76.htm">MOF Compiler</a>.</p>
<p>
The examples in the following topics use the Cimwin32.mof file that is provided in the SDK. This MOF file compiles into a database of Win32® schema classes that can be viewed by using the HTML Viewer. </p>
<p>
The HTML Viewer uses a pure HTML output to present the following information:
<ul>
<li>
Classes</li>
<li>
Properties</li>
<li>
Instances</li>
<li>
Values</li>
</ul>
<p>
This information is presented in an HTML view derived from the CIMOM database.</p>
