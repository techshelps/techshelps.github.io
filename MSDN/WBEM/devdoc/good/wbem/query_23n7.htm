<p>
Event providers use WQL to specify the types of event notifications that they support; event consumers use WQL to specify the types of event notifications that they receive. The WQL SELECT statement includes several extensions to the standard SQL syntax to support event notification:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="query_4ihx.htm">WITHIN</a> clause</li>
<li>
<a href="query_9let.htm">GROUP BY</a> clause</li>
<li>
<a href="query_33mt.htm">HAVING COUNT</a> clause</li>
<li>
<a href="query_0242.htm">ISA</a><i> </i>operator (pronounced "is a")</li>
</ul>
<p>
Since many almost-identical events can occur within a specified amount of time, flooding is possible. To prevent possible flooding, WQL supports the GROUP BY and HAVING COUNT clauses to aggregate nearly-identical events into a single "representative" event. The result event is always an instance of the system class <a href="hmmclass_6wdw.htm"><b>__AggregateEvent</b>:</a>. All related events are summarized by the <b>Representative</b><i> </i>property, and the <b>Count</b><i> </i>property tells the user how many events actually occurred.</p>
