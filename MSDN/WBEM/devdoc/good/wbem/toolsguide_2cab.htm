<p>
The HTML pages representing class information are provided in three different views: 
<ul>
<li>
<b>Short view—</b>This page provides information immediate to the class plus any associations that involve the class. The superclass, if any, appears as a link that references the short page for the superclass. The subclasses, if any, appear as links that reference the short page for the subclasses. </li>
<li>
<b>Flat view—</b>This page provides information about the class and all of its superclasses up to the root class. </li>
<li>
<b>Verbose view—</b>The verbose view resembles the short view except that all qualifiers for the class and its properties are shown on the one page.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The developer or system administrator selects the view that best suits the current task. For example, if information about the inheritance chain and the properties inherited at each stage is needed, look at the class definitions in the flat view. However, if a brief description of the local properties is needed, look at the short view.</p>
