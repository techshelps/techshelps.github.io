<p>
Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) is an initiative undertaken by the Desktop Management Task Force to provide enterprise system managers with a standard low-cost solution for their management needs. The WBEM initiative encompasses a multitude of tasks, ranging from simple workstation configuration to full-scale enterprise management across multiple platforms. Central to the initiative is the <a href="overview_6yhr.htm">Common Information Model (CIM)</a>, an extensible data model for representing objects that exist in typical management environments, and the <a href="mof_8opx.htm">Managed Object Format (MOF)</a> language for defining and storing modelled data.</p>
<p>
The WBEM technology is an implementation of the WBEM initiative for Microsoft® Windows® platforms. By extending the CIM to represent objects that exist in Windows management environments and implementing a management infrastructure to support both the MOF language and a common programming interface, the WBEM technology enables diverse applications to transparently manage a variety of enterprise components.</p>
<p>
WBEM's management infrastructure consists the following components:
<ul>
<li>
The CIM Object Manager (CIMOM), a component that provides applications with uniform access to management data. </li>
<li>
The CIMOM repository, a central storage area for management data. </li>
</ul>
