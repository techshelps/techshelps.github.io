<p>
A logical consumer is an instance of a class that is derived from the <a href="hmmclass_3ygi.htm"><b>__EventConsumer</b></a><b> </b>system class. The logical consumer class is designed by a developer to describe the action to be taken upon receipt of an event notification. As class designer, the developer can define as many properties as are appropriate. For example, to forward events to all of the employees of a particular building, the following class with the e-mail address of the employees can be defined:</p>
<pre><code>class EMailConsumer : __EventConsumer
{
    [key] string EmailAddress;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Creating instances of the logical consumer class is up to the administrator. The administrator creates one instance of the EMailConsumer class for each employee to receive the event notification:</p>
<pre><code>instance of  EMailConsumer 
{
    EmailAddress = "mike@anywhere.com";
}

instance of  EMailConsumer 
{
    EmailAddress = "susan@somewhere.com";
}</code></pre>
<p>
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent consumers that receive events generated with the HyperMedia Management Protocol (HMMP) must define their logical consumers to be instances of a class derived from the <b>__HMMPEventConsumer </b>system class, a subclass of <b>__EventConsumer</b>. The <b>__HMMPEventConsumer</b> class has one property: <b>URLToFinalConsumer</b>. The administrator sets this property to the object path of the consumer. </p>
