<h1><a name="_hmm_sample_programs"></a>Sample Programs</h1>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
Two sets of sample programs are provided with the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) SDK: Component Object Model (COM) samples and Visual Basic samples. Sample program files, including source code, are located in the Vc and Vb subdirectories of the \Wbem\Samples directory. In addition to the brief descriptions here, each sample contains a Readme.txt file describing it. </p>

<h2><a name="_hmm_clientsample"></a>ClientSample</h2>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
ClientSample is a dialog-based application created by the Microsoft® Visual Studio™ AppWizard and uses the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library to simplify the process. This sample application demonstrates some more important WBEM capabilities such as connecting to a namespace, listing logical disks, and adding users to a WBEM workgroup.</p>

<h2><a name="_hmm_customview"></a>Customview</h2>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
Customview provides a description of the custom views for the Common Information Model (CIM) and the corresponding Automation interface. These custom views provide alternative views for object instances contained in the CIM Object Manager (CIMOM) repository. Any number of views can be defined for each class stored in the CIMOM repository.</p>
<p>
For more information on Customview, please see the Readme.txt file in the Samples\Customv subdirectory of the WBEM installation directory. </p>

<h2><a name="_hmm_eventconsumer"></a>EventConsumer</h2>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
EventConsumer is a tutorial demonstrating a permanent event consumer. This application demonstrates how to implement a simple <b>IWBEMUnboundObjectSink</b> and its class factory. You must generate your own class identifier (CLSID) when building your permanent provider.</p>

<h2><a name="_hmm_instprov"></a>Instprov</h2>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
Instprov is an example of an instance provider application. This sample is a small C++ dynamic-link library (DLL) that does not use any sort of framework.</p>
<p>
For more information on Instprov, see the Readme.txt file in the Samples\Instprov subdirectory of the WBEM installation directory.</p>
