<p>
Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) supports services that enable developers to localize classes created for the Microsoft® Windows NT®, Microsoft® Windows® 95, and Windows 98 platforms. WBEM provides mechanisms for localizing static and dynamic property and qualifier values and for decoupling lengthy descriptive text from the class to which it applies. Existing classes and instances can be localized after they have been introduced and remain unaffected.</p>
<p>
The WBEM localization process affects the Common Information Model (CIM) schema, the CIM Object Manager (CIMOM), the built-in providers, and the Managed Object Format (MOF) compiler. Localization services are provided entirely through WBEM classes specified in Unicode MOF files; the CIMOM API is not involved. </p>
