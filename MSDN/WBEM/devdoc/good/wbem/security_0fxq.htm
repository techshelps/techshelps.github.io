<p>
Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) supports a limited form of security for the Microsoft® Windows® 98 platform that involves validating a user's logon for the local machine and for remote access. A validated user is granted access to the entire Common Information Model (CIM) schema. WBEM does not secure system resources, such as individual classes, instances, and namespaces. Security is limited because Windows 98 is not a secure operating system and does not support file system or registry security.</p>
<p>
All security-related information is represented by instances of WBEM system classes located in the <b>Root\Security</b> namespace. These classes and instances can only appear in the <b>Root\Security</b> namespace and must remain there permanently. </p>
<p>
The WBEM Administrator application can be used to set permissions for WBEM users. It is similar to the User Manager application supplied with Microsoft® Windows NT®. </p>
<p>
In WBEM, all security accounts are referred to as subjects. There are two types of subjects: user and group. Users are represented by instances of the <b>__NTLMUser</b> system class, which describes individual users. Groups are represented by instances of the <b>__NTLMGroup</b> system class, which describes multiple users. Both the <b>__NTLMUser</b> and <b>__NTLMGroup</b> classes derive indirectly from the <a href="hmmclass_271w.htm"><b>__Subject</b></a><b> </b>system<b> </b>class, an abstract class that is not intended to be used for instantiation. More directly, <b>__NTLMUser</b> derives from the generic _<b>_User</b> class and <b>__NTLMGroup</b> derives from the generic <b>__Group</b> class.</p>
