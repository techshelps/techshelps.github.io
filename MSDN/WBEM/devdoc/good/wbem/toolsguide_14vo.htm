<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
The WBEM User Manager can be used in conjunction with the Windows NT User Manager to create user accounts and groups that provide the following security:
<ul>
<li>
User authentication for both local and remote logins</li>
<li>
Permissions for both local and remote access to CIM objects</li>
</ul>
<p>
Windows NT systems include two built-in groups that can be used to manage WBEM security:
<ul>
<li>
The local NT <b>Administrators</b> group<p>
All users who belong to this group have full local and remote access to the CIM Object Manager (CIMOM). Full access means read/write/delete access to all CIM objects in all namespaces (including ROOT\SECURITY). Users with access to ROOT\SECURITY can change security information. 
</li>
<li>
A local <b>WBEM Users</b> group <p>
This group is created immediately after installing WBEM, when CIMOM starts. By default, this group contains no members and provides read-only access to all namespaces except ROOT\SECURITY. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can manage most access to CIMOM by controlling the membership of these two groups using the Windows NT User Manager. </p>
<p>
You can use the WBEM User Manager to create groups with combinations of permissions different from those provided by the built-in groups. You can also create individual users, if needed.</p>
