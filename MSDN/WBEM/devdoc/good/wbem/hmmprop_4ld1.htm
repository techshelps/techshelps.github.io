<h1><a name="_hmm_system_property_reference"></a>System Property Reference</h1>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
WBEM defines a set of system properties that are associated with all classes and instances of classes in addition to class-specific properties. As with system classes, system properties begin with a double underscore to differentiate them from properties created by applications or providers which may not start with a single or double underscore. Another way to identify a system property is by using the <a href="hmmref_8e5w.htm"><b>IWbemClassObject::Get</b></a> method.</p>
<p>
Not all system properties are available on all classes or instances at all times; the details of meaning and availability are specified separately for each property in the following table.</p>
