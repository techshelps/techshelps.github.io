<p>
Timer events are events that either occur once at a particular time of day or repeatedly at regular intervals. Unlike all other types of events, timer events require explicit action by the consumer in order for them to occur. Notifications of timer events are sent by CIMOM.  </p>
<p>
There are two types of timer events:
<ul>
<li>
Absolute timer events, represented by instances of the <a href="hmmclass_5pny.htm"><b>__AbsoluteTimerInstruction</b></a> class.</li>
<li>
Interval timer events, represented by instances of the <a href="hmmclass_96em.htm"><b>__IntervalTimerInstruction</b></a><b> </b>class.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Absolute timer events occur at particular times; interval timer events occur periodically. Both timer event classes derive from the system class <a href="hmmclass_0gtq.htm"><b>__TimerInstruction</b></a>. The <b>__TimerInstruction</b> class has two properties: <b>TimerId</b> and <b>SkipIfPassed</b>. The <b>TimerId</b> property is a unique user-assigned string that specifies the identifier for the events generated by this instruction. Each event generated by a timer instruction contains that instruction's <b>TimerId</b> property as its own <b>TimerId</b> property. <b>SkipIfPassed</b> defaults to FALSE, indicating that if an event occurs when CIMOM is unavailable, a belated notification is generated. </p>
<p>
The <b>__AbsoluteTimerInstruction</b> class causes an event to occur only once at a specified date and time. This class has one property, <b>EventDateTime</b>, that consumers use to specify when the timer fires and the event occurs. <b>EventDateTime</b><i> </i>is a fixed-length and fixed-format string that uses the DMTF time format shown as follows:</p>
<pre><code>yyyymmddhhxxss.uuuuuuuu+GMT
</code></pre>
<p>
Because the DMTF time format always has an explicit offset from GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), specifying the time zone is the job of the consumer. The GMT offset is in minutes. ‹.For more information about using this representation, see the DateTime topic in the Win32 Programmer's Reference. ›</p>
<p>
The following table describes the valid contents for each portion of the <b>EventDateTime</b> property:</p>

<p>
The <b>__IntervalTimerInstruction</b><i> </i>class causes an event to occur at a regular interval, much like the WM_TIMER message in Microsoft® Windows®: The <b>__IntervalTimerInstruction</b> class has one property: <b>IntervalBetweenEvents</b>. The <b>IntervalBetweenEvents</b><i> </i>property defines the number of milliseconds between events. It is possible for CIMOM to ignore very small figures due to limitations in some operating systems.</p>
<p>
CIMOM generates a timer event notification by creating an instance of the <b>__TimerEvent</b> class. The <b>__TimerEvent</b> class has a <b>TimerId</b> property which is a copy of the <b>TimerId</b> property included in the associated __<b>TimerInstruction</b> instance. A globally unique identifier (GUID) is often useful for preventing conflicts with other timer identifiers. A <b>NumFirings </b>property specifies how many times the timer event notification was sent during an interval when it was not possible to reach the consumer. This property has the value of 1 during normal operation.</p>
<p>
The query entered as the filtering query in the event registration is usually based on the <b>TimerId</b> property<b> </b>of the timer event: Many consumers can receive event notifications generated by the same <b>__TimerInstruction</b>.</p>
