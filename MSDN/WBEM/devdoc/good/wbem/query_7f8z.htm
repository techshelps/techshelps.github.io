<p>
WQL supports the programmatic traversal of associations with a SELECT statement that uses an association class as the target class and with the following two query extension statements:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="query_3b04.htm">ASSOCIATORS OF</a></li>
<li>
<a href="query_5mgk.htm">REFERENCES OF</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
An association describes a relationship between two classes or instances of classes. Each association is described by an <a href="concepts_5cmr.htm">association class</a>, which is tagged with the <b>Association</b> standard qualifier and has as two of its properties references to the related classes or instances.</p>
<p>
The ASSOCIATORS OF statement retrieves all instances that are associated with a particular instance, referred to as the source. The instances that are retrieved are referred to as the endpoints. For example, consider a source  that is an instance of the class <b>Adapter</b>. The Adapter class is associated with the Protocol class and with the <b>Driver</b> class. Issuing the following ASSOCIATORS OF statement retrieves all of the <b>Protocol</b> and <b>Driver</b> instances associated with that <b>Adapter</b> instance:</p>
<pre><code>associators of {Adapter="AHA-294X"}
</code></pre>
<p>
The following diagram illustrates this example. The source is an instance of the <b>Adapter</b> class. There are three association instances, two that reference a <b>Protocol</b> instance and one that references a <b>Driver</b> instance. The endpoints are the <b>Driver</b> and <b>Protocol</b> instances:</p>

<p>
The REFERENCES OF statement is similar to the ASSOCIATORS OF statement in its syntax, but rather than retrieving endpoint instances it retrieves association instances.  </p>
