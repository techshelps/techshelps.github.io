<p>
Qualifiers contain information that can be used to describe a class, an instance, a property, a method, or a parameter. Creators of classes and instances can attach qualifiers to their class and instance declarations to provide the user of those declarations, typically management applications, with more detail. </p>
<p>
There are three categories of qualifiers: those defined by the Common Information Model (CIM), those defined by WBEM, and those defined by developers. The qualifiers defined by WBEM are known as the <a href="#_hmm_qualifiers">standard qualifiers</a>. Some of the CIM and standard qualifiers are automatically assigned when a class or instance is created; others must be explicitly attached through inclusion in a MOF statement or a function call. </p>
<p>
Qualifiers can be specified in class and instance declarations using the <a href="mof_5hmb.htm">Managed Object Format (MOF) language</a> and accessed programmatically through the <a href="hmmref_8qpg.htm"><b>IWbemQualifierSet</b></a> interface. All qualifiers have a name and a value. Qualifier values can be explicit or implied. When a value is absent, the value TRUE is implied. Some qualifiers also include a descriptor known as a <a href="concepts_5mk3.htm">flavor</a></p>
<p>
Depending on the qualifier and its intended use, it may or may not be required. For example, WBEM defines the <b>Implemented</b> qualifier for methods. If a provider defines a class with a method and includes an implementation of that method, the provider must attach the qualifier <b>Implemented</b> to the method declaration. Another required qualifier is the <b>Key</b> qualifier. The <b>Key</b> qualifier must be attached to every property in a class that serves as part of the key for that class. Optional qualifiers include provider-defined qualifiers and standard qualifiers that can be used as comments. A qualifier is considered optional when its removal does not affect the functionality of the class or instance with which it is associated. </p>
