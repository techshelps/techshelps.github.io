<p>
When an application attempts to connect to CIMOM, the normal COM/DCOM proxy is loaded to make the connection. On the server side (CIMOM), COM loads the interface stub, performs user-level authentication, and completes the connection.   </p>
<p>
A user can call the DCOM function DCOMCNFG.EXE for DCOM-related access to CIMOM. However, because changes made to permissions can affect access to CIMOM, it is not recommended that users make changes with this application.</p>
<p>
Because DCOM is not supported on Windows NT 3.51 platforms, remote access on these platforms is not available. Local access on Windows NT 3.51 platforms is granted with a custom proxy and stub pair that is implemented with anonymous pipes. </p>
