<p>
Event consumers are the recipients of notifications that report the occurrence of an event. Event consumers register with CIMOM to receive the notifications by specifying a query that defines the event class and conditions under which delivery occurs.</p>
<p>
WBEM identifies two types of consumers: 
<ul>
<li>
<a href="event_73w3.htm">Temporary</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="event_3bzn.htm">Permanent</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
A temporary consumer receives event notifications only while it is active; its registration is temporary. Because registration is temporary, temporary consumers must re-register each time they start up. For example, a user interface application might register to receive notifications about objects that it displays. This type of consumer need not receive notifications when it is inactive.</p>
<p>
A permanent consumer receives event notifications until its registration is explicitly cancelled; it does not matter whether the consumer is active. When CIMOM receives an event notification for a permanent consumer, it determines whether the consumer is currently running. If not, it locates and starts the consumer. </p>
<p>
Permanent consumers correspond to actions that occur as the result of events. Notifications of the events are forwarded to permanent consumers by CIMOM if they match a user-specified filter. For example, a permanent consumer might register to receive notification of an event that results in a fax being sent.</p>
