<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
To register to receive an event notification, permanent consumers must create at least one of each of the following instances:
<ul>
<li>
Event consumer instance</li>
<li>
Event filter instance</li>
<li>
Binding between the event consumer and event filter</li>
</ul>
<p>
The event consumer instance, also known as the <a href="event_2kky.htm">logical consumer,</a> belongs to a class that is derived from the <a href="hmmclass_3ygi.htm"><b>__EventConsumer</b></a><b> </b>system class. The logical consumer class provides data to be used by the physical consumer (sink) processing the notification. </p>
<p>
The <a href="event_5cmq.htm">event filter</a> is an instance of the <a href="hmmclass_1fzm.htm"><b>__EventFilter</b></a> system class and it contains the query that defines the type of event to be delivered and the conditions under which it is delivered. </p>
<p>
The <a href="event_9vsi.htm">binding</a> is an instance of the <a href="hmmclass_6msn.htm">__<b>FilterToConsumerBinding</b></a><b> </b>system class and specifies a relationship between a particular logical consumer and a particular event filter. </p>
<p>
Users can create an unlimited number of logical consumers, event filters, and bindings.Because WBEM defines separate consumer, filter, and binding instances, permanent consumers can:
<ul>
<li>
Send events matching multiple filters to a single consumer.</li>
<li>
Send events from one filter to multiple consumers. </li>
<li>
Send each type of event to a consumer that is dedicated to handling that particular event type. </li>
</ul>
<p>
To remove a registration, a user deletes the binding that represents it. </p>
