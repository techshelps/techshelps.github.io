<p>
Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) classes can include zero or more methods, or functions that describe the behavior of the class. Including a method in a class does not guarantee an implementation of the method. The <b>Implemented</b> qualifier is attached to the method to indicate that an implementation is available for the class. </p>
<p>
A derived class inherits a method implementation by default, but it can override that implementation. When CIMOM is attempting to invoke a method for a particular instance of a class, CIMOM starts at the lowest subclass in the class hierarchy and works toward the base class searching for the <b>Implemented</b> qualifier. If no implementation is present before the base class is reached, CIMOM invokes the implementation of the base class. Providers of derived classes need to implement a method only if they want to override the implementation of the base class.</p>
