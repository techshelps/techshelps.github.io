<p>
The Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) SDK includes three applications:</p>
<p>
<a href="toolsguide_659u.htm">WBEM Object Browser</a></p>
<p>
<a href="toolsguide_07u7.htm">WBEM CIM Studio</a></p>
<p>
<a href="toolsguide_54qa.htm">WBEM HTML Viewer</a></p>
<p>
All three applications can be used to view objects in the CIMOM repository. The Object Browser and CIM Studio also allow users to change properties and qualifiers and to run selected operations. The Object Browser and CIM Studio are Microsoft® ActiveX® applications and require ActiveX capability.</p>
<p>
The HTML Viewer does not require ActiveX capability and is designed for use by advanced system managers and developers (particularly those writing providers) who do not have access to Microsoft® Internet Explorer with ActiveX.</p>
<p>
CIM Studio is the most extensive of the three applications. In addition to its use as an editor of properties and qualifiers, CIM Studio can also be used to edit classes and instances, to generate and compile Managed Object Format (MOF) files, and to generate framework provider code. </p>
