<p>
When an SNMP table collection contains an INDEX clause that contains an SNMP supported type that, in turn, contains a subtype definition derived from a fixed-length OCTET STRING, then the property must also define a further qualifier which specifies that fixed-length value. The CIM property qualifier <b>fixed_length</b> specifies this value.</p>
<p>
The following example is an excerpt from the bridge-forwarding table:</p>
<pre><code>MacAddress ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (6))

               entries for which the bridge has forwarding and/or
               filtering information.  This information is used
               by the transparent bridging function in
               determining how to propagate a received frame."
