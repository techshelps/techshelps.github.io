The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0
   included with SNA Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the Component Builder (CB) to export COBOL statements from a
component library. However, under certain circumstances, the exported COBOL
statements will not be correct.
<P>
The situation involves method parameters that are recordsets, and the
recordset parameter is declared as an array and also as having trailing
FILLER.
<P>
Under these conditions, when the component library is saved and COBOL is
exported, the trailing FILLER item in the exported COBOL statements is
generated as part of each element of the array of recordsets. This is
incorrect; there should be one occurrence of the trailing FILLER following
the array as a whole. For an example of this situation, see the sample
COBOL code in the MORE INFORMATION section of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use a text editor to manually correct the
exported COBOL.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft COM Transaction
Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0.
A supported fix is now available for SNA Server version 4.0, but has not
been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by
this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next
Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support
for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For example, the COBOL below was generated from a simple typelib. All
contents of the typelib were declared manually within CB, without using the
Import COBOL Wizard. In this code, a recordset with two elements, COLUMN1
and COLUMN2, is declared. A method is declared that has one parameter,
PARAMETER1. PARAMETER1 is declared as an array of 12 elements with 25 bytes
of trailing FILLER.
<P>
In this COBOL code that was generated from the typelib, the trailing FILLER
was generated as part of the array instead of following the entire array:
<P>
<PRE>   01  DFHCOMMAREA.
       05  FILLER OCCURS 12 TIMES.
           10  PARAMETER1 OCCURS 1 TIMES.
               15  COLUMN1                  PIC S9(4) COMP.
               15  COLUMN2                  PIC S9(4) COMP.
           10  FILLER                       PIC X(25).

</PRE>In this example, the preceding COBOL code should be modified so that the
FILLER is not part of the array, as shown in the following code:
<P>
<PRE>   01  DFHCOMMAREA.
       05  FILLER OCCURS 12 TIMES.
           10  PARAMETER1 OCCURS 1 TIMES.
               15  COLUMN1                  PIC S9(4) COMP.
               15  COLUMN2                  PIC S9(4) COMP.
       05  FILLER                           PIC X(25).
</PRE>
