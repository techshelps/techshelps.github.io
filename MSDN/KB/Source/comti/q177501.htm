The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When an application component was tested, the code page for English (United
States) was used for character translation, but the Language Locale
attribute specified in the Remote Environment (RE) Properties page was
French (Standard). The default code pages were selected for both Language
Locales.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The RE was created with the Language Locale attribute set to English. A
component was assigned to this RE and tested. After this test, the Language
Locale in the RE was changed to French (Standard) and the component was
tested again. However, the new French code page was not used and the
application did not work properly.
<P>
Changes to locale and code page attributes for a Remote Environment will
not take effect until all run-time activity is stopped.
<P>
Specifically, locale and code page attributes of an RE can be changed using
the COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) Management Console on the Locale
property page. When the user updates these attributes, the COMTI Management
Console immediately saves the updated values in the Windows NT registry.
However, these updated values are not loaded by the COMTI run-time elements
if components assigned to the RE are being used.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To ensure that the COMTI run-time elements use modified locale and code
page information, locate the My Computer item in the Microsoft Transaction
Server folder and issue the Shut Down Server Processes command. This will
stop the COMTI run-time elements and force a reload of the updated RE
information from the Windows NT registry.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server  4.0. A supported
fix is now available for SNA Server 4.0, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
