or updated drivers from the Windows Driver Library (WDL), carry out
the following procedure.

<OL><P><LI>If do not have access to a modem, obtain a floppy disk that
   contains the driver by calling Microsoft Product Support Services.
   Then proceed to step 4.

<P><LI>If you have a modem, download the driver to a floppy disk from one
   of the following online services.
<P>

   Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Mouse icon, click the General tab, and then click
   Change.

   box.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The drivers are available at no charge; however, standard
connect-time fees and long-distance telephone charges, if any, apply.
<P>
<P><h2>Logitech Mouse</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 Logitech driver supports Logitech MouseWare features.
To use the middle button of a three-button Logitech Mouse, use the
Logitech Mouse Control Center that came with your mouse.
<P>
If you are running Windows 95, do not run the Logitech MouseWare Setup
program that was written for Windows 3.1. If you do, open Mouse
properties, click the General tab, and then click Change. Then select
the appropriate Windows 95 Logitech mouse type.
<P>
If you use a Logitech serial mouse, but there is a PS/2 mouse port on
your computer, Windows 95 may not correctly install the Logitech
driver. If this occurs, use the Device Manager tab in System
properties to change the PS/2 mouse item, if present, to "Logitech
Serial Mouse."
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Mouse Systems/Genius</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 does not have built-in drivers for the Mouse Systems or Genius 3-
button mouse. The standard mouse driver will work with these devices in
their 2-button mode. Driver updates are available from the Windows Driver
Library or in the \Drivers\Mouse\Mousesys folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM.
<P>
<P><h2>Microsoft Natural Keyboards</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 has built-in support for your Microsoft Natural Keyboard.
Windows logo keys have added functionality under the new operating
system.
<P>
You will be unable to install IntelliType version 1.00 under Windows
95. If you upgrade to Windows 95 over a previously installed Windows
3.1 configuration, IntelliType will have limited functionality.
<P>
If you are upgrading a Windows 3.1x configuration that has IntelliType
version 1.00 software, it is recommended that you delete the following
line from your System.ini file, which is located in the folder that
contains your Windows 95 files:
<P>
taskman.exe=TASKSW16.EXE
<P>
This will deactivate the Windows 3.1 IntelliType Task Manager and
ensure full support of the Windows logo keys under Windows 95.
<P>
<P>
Microsoft IntelliPoint 1.00
 
<P>
Windows 95 has built-in support for your Microsoft mouse.
<P>
You will be unable to install IntelliPoint version 1.00 under Windows
95. If you upgrade to Windows 95 over a previously installed Windows
3.1 configuration, IntelliPoint will have limited functionality.
Contact Microsoft for an updated version of IntelliPoint software.
<P>
<P>
Microsoft BallPoint Mouse
 
<P>
If you need to adjust settings for your BallPoint mouse such as
orientation, use the Mouse Manager or IntelliPoint control panel icon
that came with your mouse. If this control panel is not already
installed on your computer, contact Microsoft for an updated version
of the mouse software.
