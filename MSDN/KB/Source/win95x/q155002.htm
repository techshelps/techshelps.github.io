<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes DirectX 2.0, which is included with Windows 95 OEM
Service Release 2 (OSR2)
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
DirectX was developed to provide Windows-based programs with high-
performance, real-time access to available hardware on current computer
systems. DirectX provides a consistent interface between hardware
manufacturers and the program developer.
<P>
One of the primary reasons for creating DirectX was to promote games
development on the Windows platform. The majority of games developed for
the personal computer today are MS-DOS-based. However, when developing MS-
DOS-based games, developers must conform to a number of hardware
implementations for a variety of cards, which complicates installation. In
addition, development of MS-DOS-based games can be much more complex on a
personal computer than on a console system, due to the generalized
processor, greater RAM size, and persistent storage of the personal
computer.
<P>
A high-performance Windows-based game will:

<UL><LI>Be installed easily.

<LI>Take advantage of hardware accelerator cards designed specifically
   for improving performance.

<LI>Take advantage of Windows hardware and software standards such as Plug
   and Play.

<LI>Take advantage of the communications services built into Windows.
<P>
</UL>The following features of DirectX 2.0 combine to achieve these goals:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft DirectDraw program programming interface
<P>
   This accelerates hardware and software animation techniques by provid-
   ing direct access to bitmaps in off-screen display memory as well as
   extremely fast access to the blitting and buffer-flipping capabilities
   of the hardware.

<LI>The Microsoft DirectSound program programming interface
<P>
   This enables hardware and software sound mixing and playback.

<LI>The Microsoft DirectPlay program programming interface
<P>
   This allows easy connectivity of games over a modem link or network.

<LI>The Microsoft Direct3D program programming interface
<P>
   Direct3D is a complete set of real-time 3D graphics services that
   delivers fast software-based rendering of the full 3D rendering pipe-
   line (transformations, lighting, and rasterization) and transparent
   access to hardware acceleration. Direct3D is fully scalable, enabling
   all or part of the 3D rendering pipeline to be accelerated by hardware.
   Direct3D exposes advanced graphics capabilities of 3D hardware
   accelerators, including z-buffering, anti-aliasing, alpha blending,
   mipmapping, atmospheric effects, and perspective-correct texture
   mapping. Integration with other DirectX technologies enables Direct3D
   to deliver such features as video mapping, hardware 3D rendering in 2D
   overlay planes, and even sprites, providing use of 2D and 3D graphics
   in interactive media titles.

<LI>The Microsoft DirectInput program programming interface
<P>
   This provides joystick input capabilities to your game that are
   scaleable to future Windows hardware input APIs and drivers.

<LI>The Microsoft AutoPlay feature of the Microsoft Windows 95 operating
   system
<P>
   This lets your CD-ROM run an installation program or the game itself
   immediately upon insertion of the CD-ROM
