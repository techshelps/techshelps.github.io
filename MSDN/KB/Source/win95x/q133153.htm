<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains questions and answers about Microsoft Backup for
Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. What tape drive units are supported by Microsoft Backup?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Microsoft Backup supports tape drives that attach to the floppy
       disk drive controller and that conform to the QIC-40, 80, or 3010
       specification. Microsoft Backup also supports Colorado Memory
       Systems parallel-port tape drives. For additional information about
       supported tape drives, see the "Tape drives that are compatible
       with Backup" topic in Microsoft Backup Help.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       NOTE: QIC-WIDE tapes are not supported by Microsoft Backup.
       Microsoft Backup cannot read from, write to, or format these tapes.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Microsoft Backup did not detect my SCSI tape backup drive. Can I
<P><PRE>       configure it to work with Microsoft Backup?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. SCSI tape drives are not currently supported in Microsoft Backup.
       For additional information about supported tape drives, see the
       "Tape drives that are compatible with Backup" topic in Microsoft
       Backup Help.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Can I use the FC-20 tape controller that came with my tape drive
<P><PRE>       with Microsoft Backup?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Microsoft Backup does not support proprietary controller cards for
       tape drives. Similar unsupported controllers include FC-10 and
       FC-15 controllers and controllers from Iomega. For additional
       information about supported tape drives, see the "Tape drives that
       are compatible with Backup" topic in Microsoft Backup Help.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Does Microsoft Backup support the new 350 MB tapes?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. Microsoft Backup supports extended-length tapes formatted to
       the QIC-80 specification as long as the tape drive itself supports
       the tape. Please consult your tape drive manufacturer to determine
       if the tape drive supports extended-length tapes.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Can Microsoft Backup restore data from backup sets created by
<P><PRE>       third-party MS-DOS-based or Windows 3.1-based tape backup programs?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes, provided that the third-party tape backup program conforms to
       the QIC standard for implementing compression. Please consult the
       third-party software documentation or manufacturer for information
       about the specification used.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Can Microsoft Backup restore data from backup sets created by
<P><PRE>       earlier versions of Microsoft Backup?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. No. Microsoft Backup in Windows 95 does not support the format used
       in earlier versions of Microsoft Backup.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       For additional information, see the following article in the
       Microsoft Knowledge Base:

          TITLE     : Restoring Backups Created with Earlier Versions of
                      MS-DOS

</PRE><P><LI> Q. Does Microsoft Backup include support for incremental backups?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. Microsoft Backup supports creating full and incremental
       backup sets. There is currently no differential backup support in
       Microsoft Backup.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       To enable incremental backup, click Options on the Microsoft Backup
       Settings menu, then click the Incremental option button on the
       Backup tab.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. If I create a full backup set using Microsoft Backup and then
<P><PRE>       remove Windows 95, how do I use Microsoft Backup to restore my
       files?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Microsoft Backup requires Windows 95. You must install at least a
       minimal configuration of Windows 95, including Microsoft Backup.
       You can then use Microsoft Backup to restore all your files.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. When I restore just one or two files from my backup set, I receive
<P><PRE>       a message stating "There may have been an error restoring the
       registry. Your computer may not work properly." Why does this
       message appear when I have not chosen to restore the registry?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. This message appears when you restore files from the "Full System
       Backup.set" backup set. This backup set is intended to be used only
       to perform a full system backup or restore. The "Full System
       Backup.set" backup set contains the files necessary to restore your
       Windows 95 configuration to its original state. Keep this backup
       set in a safe place in case your hard disk partition or the Windows
       folder is damaged. Create separate backup sets for backing up other
       data.
</PRE>
<PRE>10. Q. How do I get Windows 95 to detect my tape drive? Device Manager
       does not list my tape drive, but it is a supported unit.

    A. Tape drive detection is performed by Microsoft Backup when it
       loads. Microsoft Backup does not rely on the operating system for
       information about tape drive units attached to the system. It is
       not necessary for your tape drive to be listed in Device Manager.
