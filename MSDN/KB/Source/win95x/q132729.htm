The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 may not prevent you from choosing display resolutions or color
depths that are not supported by your display adapter. Choosing an
unsupported resolution or color depth may cause your computer to stop
responding (hang), or may cause the display to become garbled.
<P>
This problem is known to occur with the following display adapters:

<UL><LI>ATI VGA Wonder
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem typically occurs with display adapters that are available with
varying amounts of installed memory. Because there is only one driver for
all variations of a display adapter model, the driver must support the
resolution and color depth that the adapter is capable of supporting with
the greatest amount of installed memory. Windows 95 cannot detect when you
are using a display adapter with less than the greatest amount of installed
memory. Therefore, Windows 95 may allow you to choose a resolution or color
depth that is not currently supported by the display adapter.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Choose a lower resolution or color depth that is supported by the display
adapter. You may need to restart your computer in Safe mode to do so. To
start your computer in Safe mode, restart your computer, press the F8 key
when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, and then choose Safe Mode.
<P>
To use the higher resolution or color depth, you must increase the amount
of memory installed on the display adapter. You may be able to add more
memory to the adapter you are currently using, or you may need to obtain an
adapter that has more memory installed. For information about increasing
the amount of memory on the display adapter, please contact the adapter's
manufacturer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>ATI VGA Wonder</h3>
 
<P>
Some ATI VGA Wonder display adapters have 256K of installed memory. These
adapters are not capable of displaying 256 colors, although you can select
the 256-color palette in the Display Properties dialog box.
<P>
When you are using the ATI VGA Wonder XL24 display adapter, you can choose
the High Color (16 Bit) and True Color (24 Bit) color palettes, but these
palettes are not supported by the display adapter.
