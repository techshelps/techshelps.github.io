The information in this article applies to:

</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install one or more Windows 3.1 device drivers in Windows 95,
the devices associated with those Windows 3.1 drivers may appear in the
Windows 95 hardware lists. These hardware lists appear in the Add New
Hardware Wizard that is started by double-clicking the Add New Hardware
icon in Control Panel, and in other wizards such as the Add Printer and
Install New Modem Wizards.
<P>
If Windows 95 includes a driver for the same device for which you
installed a Windows 3.1 driver, it may be difficult to distinguish between
the Windows 3.1 driver and the Windows 95 driver in the hardware lists.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you install a Windows 3.1 device driver in Windows 95, an Oem&lt;n&gt;.inf
file is created, where &lt;n&gt; is an incremental number starting at 0. The
presence of an Oem&lt;n&gt;.inf file causes the device to appear in the hardware
lists.
<P>
Because Windows 3.1 setup information (.inf) files do not conform to the
Windows 95 setup information file format, Windows 95 may be unable to
clearly identify the drivers associated with one of these files.
<P>
RESOLUTION
 
<P>
To remove all Windows 3.1 drivers from the hardware lists, rename all the
Oem&lt;n&gt;.inf files in the Windows\Inf folder. Doing so does not affect the
Windows 3.1 drivers that you currently have installed, but does prevent
you from reinstalling the drivers without the original Oemsetup.inf files
included with each driver.
<P>
To rename the Oem&lt;n&gt;.inf files in the Windows\Inf folder, type the
following commands at a command prompt, pressing ENTER after each
command:
<P>
<PRE>   cd \windows\inf
   ren oem?.inf oem?.xxx

</PRE>If there are more than 10 Oem&lt;n&gt;.inf files, you must also type the
following command:
<P>
<PRE>   ren oem??.inf oem??.xxx

</PRE>NOTE: Do not use the oem*.inf wildcard designation in place of Oem?.inf
and Oem??.inf. Doing so may cause the wrong files to be renamed.
<P>
If there are no Oem&lt;n&gt;.inf files in the Windows\Inf folder, you can force
Windows 95 to rebuild the entire driver information database by renaming
the Drvdata.bin and Drvidx.bin files in the Windows\Inf folder. To do so,
type the following commands at a command prompt, pressing ENTER after each
command:
<P>
<PRE>   cd \windows\inf
   ren drvdata.bin drvdata.xxx
   ren drvidx.bin drvidx.xxx

</PRE>After you rename these files, the driver information database will be
rebuilt the next time the hardware lists are displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 setup information files can contain a key that identifies the
manufacturer of the associated driver, and that distinguishes that driver
from drivers included with Windows 95. This lets you install third-party
Windows 95 drivers without creating confusion when you view the hardware
lists.
<P>
For example, if you have a third-party Windows 95 driver for the Hewlett-
Packard LaserJet 4M printer installed, you see two lines similar to the
following lines when you view the hardware list in the Add New Hardware or
Add Printer Wizard:
<P>
<PRE>   HP LaserJet 4 (Microsoft)
   HP LaserJet 4 (Hewlett-Packard)
