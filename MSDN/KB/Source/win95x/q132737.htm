<OL><P><LI> Q. What are the system requirements for installing Windows 95?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Your computer must meet these minimal requirements:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - Computer:        386DX, 20 MHz (or higher) processor.

        - Memory:          4 MB (8 MB recommended).
                           8 MB is required to run The Microsoft
                           Network, Microsoft Exchange, or multiple
                           32-bit programs.

        - Hard Disk:       20 to 90 MB of available hard disk space.
                           The actual space required depends on whether
                           you are upgrading to Windows 95 and the
                           Setup option you choose.

        - Video:           VGA or higher resolution (SVGA recommended).

        - Peripheral:      High-density floppy disk drive, CD-ROM
                           drive, or the ability to install from
                           a network server.

        - Pointing Device: Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing
                           device.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. I upgraded to Windows 95, and now I do not see Program Manager.
<P><PRE>       How do I run programs in Windows 95?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. All of your Windows 3.1 program groups are converted into
       cascading menus off the Start menu in Windows 95. To run your
       programs in Windows 95, click the Start button, point to
       Programs, point to the group containing the program you want to
       run, then click the program's icon. Note that you need to click
       the program icon only once to start the program; you do not
       have to double-click the icon.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       If you want to use Program Manager to run your programs, you
       can. To do so, click the Start button, click Run, type
       "progman" (without the quotation marks) in the Open box, and
       then press ENTER. Note that Program Manager does not use
       long filenames.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How do I copy a floppy disk in Windows 95?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Use the following steps to copy a floppy disk:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Double-click My Computer.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       2. Use the right mouse button to click the floppy disk drive
<PRE></PRE>          containing the disk you want to copy, and then click Copy
          Disk on the menu that appears.

       3. In the Copy From box, click the drive containing the disk
          you want to copy. In the Copy To box, click the drive
          containing the disk you want to copy to, and then click
          Start.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. How do I add or remove Windows 95 components?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. To add or remove Windows 95 components, use these steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
<PRE></PRE>          Control Panel.

       2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

       3. Click the Windows Setup tab, and then follow the
          instructions on the tab.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. A friend has a version of Windows 95 that includes more
<P><PRE>       features than my version. Why does my version not have the same
       features?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Windows 95 is available on CD-ROM and floppy disks. More
       components are included in the CD-ROM version because of the
       additional space available on the CD-ROM. To obtain the CD-ROM
       Extras for Windows 95 upgrade on 3.5-inch high-density disks,
       use the coupon included in your Windows 95 package. You can
       also download the CD-ROM Extras for Windows 95 upgrade from the
       Microsoft Software Library. For more information about
       downloading the CD-ROM Extras for Windows 95 upgrade, please
       see the Extra.txt file in Windows 95.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What is a shortcut, and how do I add one to the Start menu?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. A shortcut is a link to an object (such as a program or
       document). A shortcut can point to a file on your computer or a
       file on a network server. A shortcut can even point to a
       paragraph in a document. To add a shortcut to the Start menu,
       use the following two steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Use the right mouse button to click the taskbar, and then
<PRE></PRE>          click Properties on the menu that appears.

       2. On the Start Menu Programs tab, click Add and follow the
          instructions.

       For more information about creating shortcuts, click the Start
       button, click Help, click the Index tab, and search for
       "shortcuts."

</PRE><P><LI> Q. What is Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 is a software package that
       includes many add-ons for Windows 95, such as:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - Microsoft Internet Explorer (so you can surf the Internet)

        - Dial-Up Networking Server (so other computers can dial in to
          your computer)

        - New DriveSpace(TM) disk compression

        - 3D Pinball

        - Desktop Themes (so you can personalize your desktop with
          wallpaper, icons, and screen savers)

</PRE><P><LI> Q. How can I view two drives at one time as I did using File
<P><PRE>       Manager in Windows 3.1?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. To view two drives in Windows 95, open two instances of Windows
       Explorer or My Computer.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How do I create or modify file associations in Windows 95?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. To create, modify, or remove file associations, use the
       following three steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Double-click My Computer.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       2. On the View menu, click Options.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       3. Click the File Types tab. To create a file association,
<PRE></PRE>          click New Type. To modify an association, click the file
          type in the Registered File Types box, and then click Edit.
          To remove an association, click the file type, and then
          click Remove.

       When you double-click a file type without an association,
       Windows 95 opens a dialog box so you can create an association
       if you want.

10. Q. Is it true that filenames in Windows 95 are not limited to
       eight characters plus a three-character extension?

    A. Yes. In Windows 95 you can create filenames with up to 250
       characters. For example, you can create a filename called "June
       Summary Report.doc." If the program you are using does not
       recognize long filenames, Windows 95 supplies short MS-DOS
       filenames.

       For more information about long filenames, please see the
       following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
