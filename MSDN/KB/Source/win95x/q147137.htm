The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information about using the Remote Mail feature in
Microsoft Exchange.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use Microsoft Exchange to log on to a remote mail system using a
modem or LAN and view the mail waiting on the server. You can then down-
load the mail, download a copy of the mail and leave a copy on the server,
or delete the mail on the server. This feature was primarily designed for
mobile computer users who retrieve mail from home and work, but can also
be used any time you want to see your messages before downloading them.
Note that not all Microsoft Exchange information services have the ability
to use the Remote Mail feature.
<P>
<P><h3>Preparing Your Computer for Remote Mail</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Install Microsoft Exchange and the appropriate information services
   (for example, Internet Mail or Microsoft Mail) on the computer you
   will be using for Remote Mail.

<P><LI>If you plan on using Remote Mail with a modem, install the modem and
   create a Dial-Up Networking connection to the network your mail server
   is on.
<P>
   For information about creating a Dial-Up Networking connection, see
   the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Install a Point-to-Point Protocol in Windows

</PRE><P><LI>Make sure that you do not have Microsoft Exchange running on another
   computer and downloading mail from the same server. If you do, that
   computer may continue to download messages and remove them from the
   server.
<P>
</OL><h3>Specifying Configuration Options for Remote Mail</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Exchange.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Mail And Fax.

<P><LI>Click the information service with which you want to use Remote
   Mail, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>Select the options you want to use. For information about an option,
   click Help. When you are done, close the property sheet and restart
   Microsoft Exchange.
<P>
</OL><h3>Sending and Receiving Mail Remotely</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Exchange on the computer configured for Remote Mail.

<P><LI>Compose messages as you normally would. When you click Send, composed
   messages are placed in the Outbox to await delivery.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Remote Mail. If more than one information
   service is configured to use Remote Mail, click the service you want
   to use.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Connect And Update Headers. If you are not
   using a modem to connect or you have already connected, click Update
   Headers instead. If you are not connected, you are given the option to
   connect and log on to your network. Once you are connected, you see
   the headers of messages waiting on your server in the Remote Mail
   window.
<P>
   For each message, you can click Mark To Retrieve, Mark To Retrieve A
   Copy, or Mark To Delete. You can mark a message by clicking the message
   and then clicking the command you want to use on the Edit menu, or by
   using the right mouse button to click the message and then clicking the
   command you want to use on the menu that appears. The Mark To Retrieve
   command downloads the message to your computer and removes it from the
   server. The Mark To Retrieve A Copy command downloads a copy of the
   message and leaves the message on the computer. The Mark To Delete
   command deletes the message without downloading it.

<P><LI>After you have marked the messages, click Transfer Mail on the Tools
   menu.
