<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains questions and answers about Microsoft Fax for
Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. What fax/modems does Microsoft Fax support?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Microsoft Fax supports Class 1 and Class 2 fax/modems. Class 1
       fax/modems can send documents to each other in an editable (or
       e-mail) format. Class 2 fax/modems can send and receive faxes in
       facsimile format only.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why does my CAS modem not work with Microsoft Fax?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. CAS modems (such as the Intel SatisFAXtion 200i, Intel SatisFAXtion
       400i, and GammaLink CAS modem) are not supported in Microsoft Fax.
       A firmware revision is available from Pure Data for the Intel
       SatisFAXtion 400i CAS modem to make it Class 1 compatible.  For
       information about whether your modem can be made Class 1 compatible,
       please contact your modem manufacturer.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why does Microsoft Fax indicate that it is going offline when I use
<P><PRE>       The Microsoft Network?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. This occurs because you have selected both Microsoft Fax and The
       Microsoft Network services in your Microsoft Exchange profile. When
       you launch electronic mail services using The Microsoft Network,
       Microsoft Exchange attempts to load all the installed providers,
       causing Microsoft Fax to be loaded as well. Microsoft Fax cannot
       initialize the communications port because The Microsoft Network is
       already connected. When you disconnect from The Microsoft Network,
       Microsoft Fax can go online automatically.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I upgraded my shared Windows for Workgroups At Work Fax server to
<P><PRE>       the Windows 95 network fax server and now I cannot connect to it
       using a Windows for Workgroups At Work Fax client. Why?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The network fax server components have been redesigned in Windows
       95, causing you to be unable to connect to Windows 95 network fax
       servers using Windows for Workgroups At Work Fax clients. A
       resolution for this problem should be available soon.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why is Microsoft Fax unable to initialize the modem when I start
<P><PRE>       Microsoft Exchange? CompuServe Mail does not seem to have a problem
       accessing the modem.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. If you have both CompuServe Mail and Microsoft Fax services
       installed in your Microsoft Exchange profile and you have enabled
       the Retrieve Mail On Startup option for CompuServe Mail, Microsoft
       Fax cannot initialize the port until the CompuServe Mail service
       disconnects and releases the port. To work around this behavior,
       disable the Retrieve Mail On Startup option in CompuServe Mail so
       that Microsoft Fax can initialize the modem. Once Microsoft Fax has
       initialized the modem, connect to CompuServe and retrieve your mail.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. When I compose a new message and address it using the [FAX:XXX-XXXX]
<P><PRE>       format, the prefix settings are ignored. Why?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. When you use this format to send a fax, Microsoft Fax does not use
       TAPI services to create a phone number to dial and ignores prefixes
       defined using TAPI. To work around this behavior, use the following
       format instead:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          [FAX:+1 (XXX) XXX-XXXX]

</PRE><P><LI> Q. Why does my fax/modem connect at only 9600 bits per second (bps)?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. During the development and testing of Microsoft Fax, we found that
       some fax/modems are unreliable when sending at 14.4 bps in fax mode.
       High-speed transmission is disabled for these modems. If you feel
       your fax/modem supports high-speed transmission, you can enable
       high-speed transmission with the following steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control
<PRE></PRE>          Panel.

       2. Double-click the Mail And Fax icon, click Microsoft Fax, then
          click Properties.

       3. On the Modem tab, click your modem, then click Properties.

       4. Click the Advanced button, then click the Disable High Speed
          Transmission check box to clear it. Click OK.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. Why can I send faxes but not receive them?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. To receive incoming faxes, you must start Microsoft Exchange and
       set the modem to Auto Answer or Manual Answer mode.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. When I send a fax in binary format I receive an error message
<P><PRE>       stating "Editable format not supported." Why?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. To use binary format or advanced security options, both the sending
       and receiving fax/modems must be supported Class 1 fax/modems.
</PRE>
<PRE>10. Q. Can I make my fax/modem answer the phone in one ring?

    A. No, there is no way to make the fax/modem answer in one ring. This
       is a limitation of Microsoft Fax.
