The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the TCP/IP protocol with a server-based installation of
Windows 95, you may be unable to resolve TCP/IP names when you are using
32-bit programs. This problem is known to occur when a DNS or WINS server
is used to resolve TCP/IP names, or when a HOSTS or LMHOSTS file is used.
The problem does not occur with 16-bit programs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you install the TCP/IP protocol, Windows 95 creates a new value called
HelperDllName under the following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Mstcp\
   Parameters\Winsock

</PRE>Windows 95 also creates a new value called ProviderPath under the following
registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Mstcp\
   ServiceProvider

</PRE>Both of these registry values are given the following value:
<P>
<PRE>   %windir%\system\wsock32.dll

</PRE>This value causes Windows 95 to look for the Wsock32.dll file in your
personal Windows\System folder on your local hard disk, the network server,
or a floppy disk. However, when you are using a server-based installation
of Windows 95, the Wsock32.dll file is located in the System folder in the
shared Windows folder on the network server.
<P>
If Windows 95 is unable to locate the Wsock32.dll file, it is unable to
resolve TCP/IP names when you use 32-bit programs that require TCP/IP name
resolution.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Create a System folder in your personal Windows folder, and then copy
   the Wsock32.dll file from the System folder that is in the shared
   Windows folder on the network server to the new folder.
<P>
   NOTE: If you are a network administrator and you are implementing this
   workaround on multiple server-based installations of Windows 95, you
   must create a System folder in each user's personal Windows folder, and
   then copy the Wsock32.dll file to each of the new System folders.

<LI>NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the
   Changing Keys And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor
   (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a backup copy of the
   registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
   registry.
<P>
   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
   that may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot
   guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry
   Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
   Modify the registry entries listed earlier in this article so that the
   values for HelperDllName and ProviderPath are set to the correct path
   for the Wsock32.dll file. For example, if the shared Windows folder on
   the network server is called Winnet, and the network server is
   mapped as drive F, the HelperDllName and ProviderPath values should be
   given the following value:
<P>
<P><PRE>      f:\winnet\system\wsock32.dll
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This workaround is not preferred. The next time you add or remove
   a network component, the new value may be replaced with the original
   value.

<LI>To prevent this problem from occurring with future installations of
   Windows 95, modify the Nettrans.inf file so that the HelperDllName and
   ProviderPath registry values are given the correct value when you
   install Windows 95 from the network server.
<P>
   NOTE: Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files,
   and Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) does not support this
   procedure. Although we have tested the following procedure and it
   appears to function as described, you should make a backup copy of your
   .inf file before you proceed.
<P>
   To modify the Nettrans.inf file so that this problem does not occur
   when you install Windows 95 from the network server, open the file in
   any text editor and replace both instances of "%windir%" with "%25%"
   (without quotation marks). Save the file, and then copy it to the
   shared Windows folder on the network server, and to the Inf and Suwin
   folders in the shared Windows folder on the network server.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
