<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Unimodem V is the newest release of Unimodem, the Windows universal modem
driver/telephony service provider for data/fax modems. Unimodem V provides
the driver support that sits between telephony applications and voice
modems and allows them to work together. This driver adds the most
requested features to support data/fax/voice modems, including wave file
playback and recording to and from the phone line, wave file playback and
recording to and from the handset, and support for speakerphones, Caller
ID, distinctive ringing, and call forwarding.
<P>
Independent hardware vendors (IHVs) and original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs) can include Unimodem V with voice modem hardware so that telephony
applications can run on their hardware. Independent software vendors
(ISVs) can include Unimodem V with telephony applications so that their
applications can run on voice modems that may not already include Unimodem
V. Users can use Unimodem V with a telephony application or a voice modem
if neither includes Unimodem V.
