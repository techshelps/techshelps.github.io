The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Device Manager displays an exclamation point in a yellow circle for a PCI
device. The status for this device reads:
<P>
<PRE>   The device has been disabled in the hardware. In order to use this
   device, you must re-enable the hardware. See your hardware
   documentation for details. (Code 29.)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur for either of two reasons:

<UL><LI>Windows 95 knows the hardware will not function.

<LI>The hardware is configured incorrectly.
<P>
</UL><h3>Windows 95 Knows the Hardware Will Not Function</h3>
 
<P>
Read the README.TXT file in the Windows folder to see if there is a known
problem with the device. If the information in the README.TXT file does not
help you solve the problem, please contact the device's manufacturer for
additional instructions.
<P>
<P><h3>The Hardware Is Configured Incorrectly</h3>
 
<P>
The problem may be due to a configuration error in your computer's BIOS.
This can happen if the hardware is set to use resources that Windows 95
knows are not usable by the device. To verify that this is the problem,
check the I/O range for the device. If the I/O range starts at 0, Windows
95 cannot activate the hardware.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to resolve the problem by removing the device and
refreshing it on the PCI bus. This causes the PCI bus to be enumerated
again and lets Windows 95 reconfigure the hardware. To remove and refresh
a PCI device, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the System icon.

<P><LI>Click the Device Manager tab, click the PCI device, then click the
   Remove button.
<P>
   NOTE: The software for this device is removed from the current
   configuration for your computer.

<P><LI>Click the View Devices By Connection option button and then click
   PCI Bus.

<P><LI>Click the Refresh button.
<P>
   NOTE: The PCI device is detected, configured, and placed back in
   the Device Manager.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are not sure whether a device is a PCI device, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the System icon.

<P><LI>Click the Device Manager tab, then click the View Devices By
   Connection option button.

<P><LI>Determine whether the device is on the PCI bus. If the device is on
   the PCI bus, it is a PCI device. If the device is on the ISA or
   the EISA bus, the device is not a PCI device.
<P></OL>
