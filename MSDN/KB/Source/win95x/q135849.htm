Online Help: Planning for Shared Installations
 
<P>
The fourth bulleted item of this topic states: "For protected-mode
network clients, you cannot use a PCI network adapter or ISA adapters
on a PCI computer for system startup over the network. This is
because PCI adapters do not start until the second booting of Windows
95. For shared installations, the adapter must start on the first
boot."
<P>
This item should state: "For protected-mode network clients, you
cannot use a PCI, EISA, or ISA Plug and Play network adapter for system
startup over the network. This is because these adapters do not start until

<PRE>   If computers running Windows 95 will be providing File and Printer
   Sharing Services for NetWare Networks, then the NetWare server
   providing access validation must be configured with a special
   WINDOWS_PASSTHRU account. This special account is used to support
   pass-through validation for user-level security.

<P><PRE>      ...add a registry value named MaxLIP and specify a binary or
      DWORD value that is the greatest value allowed on any one network
      segment.
</PRE><P>
   Note that the value should actually be a binary value entered in

<P>
The second bulleted item of this section states:
<P>
SPX-II is a protocol definition for windowing and transmitting large
packets over SPX. You can run any SPX-II application under Windows 95
using the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol. The related Novell-supplied file
TLI.DLL must be available on the computer to support SPX-II.
<P>
This item should read:
<P>
SPX-II is a protocol definition for windowing and transmitting large
packets over SPX. The IPX/SPX-compatible protocol included with Windows 95
(Nwlink.vxd) does not support SPX-II. There are third-party dynamic link
libraries (DLLs) available that provide SPX-II support when you are using
Nwlink.vxd. However, if you are using a third-party DLL intended to
provide SPX-II support and a program communicates directly with
Nwlink.vxd, SPX-II support is not available to that program.

<PRE>   When you install Windows 95 from the installation floppy disks, System
   Policy Editor is installed automatically with the operational system
   files. This tool can be used to modify INI files, CONFIG.SYS, and
   AUTOEXEC.BAT.

</PRE>This statement is incorrect. The tool that is installed automatically is
System Configuration Editor, not System Policy Editor. You can use System
Configuration Editor to modify INI files and the Config.sys and
Autoexec.bat files.

<UL><LI>The "Long filenames cannot be used on SUBST drives" item is incorrect.
   Long file names can be used on SUBST drives.

<LI>The "To use friendly alias names instead of numeric tails" item is
   incorrect. Windows 95 does not support the NameNumericTail setting.

<P>
The "Turning off the extended file system features" and "To enable the

support this. For example, if you edited the registry to include the
Win31FileSystem key, Windows 95 would ignored it.

<P><h3>Online Help: Creating an Apps.ini File</h3>
 
<P>
The Creating An Apps.ini File section has two errors:

<UL><LI>The To Create An Apps.ini File topic does not include a step to add
   the [AppInstallList] section. These are the correct steps:
<P>
   1. Use a text editor to create a file that contains a list of
<P><PRE>      applications using the following format:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         [AppInstallList]
         &lt;application name&gt; = [*] &lt;UNC path&gt;
         For &lt;application name&gt;, substitute the name that you want users
         to see on the Network Install tab. For &lt;UNC path&gt;, substitute the
         network location of the Setup application. If a Setup application
         cannot work with UNC names, include an asterisk before it. For
         example:

            word for windows=*\\applications\forusers\word60\setup.exe

   2. Save the Apps.ini file on a server to which users have read-only
      access.

</PRE><LI>The "To display the applications listed in Apps.ini on the Network
   Install tab" topic incorrectly lists the registry key as:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Hkey_Local_Machine/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Current Version

   You should actually add a string value named "appinstallpath" (without
   quotation marks) to the following registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Hkey_Local_Machine/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/Current Version
</PRE><P>
   The data for the "appinstallpath" value should be the UNC path to the
   Apps.ini file, including the file name. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;share&gt;\&lt;installpath&gt;\apps.ini

</UL><h3>Page 755: Limit on Number of Installed TrueType Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
Page 755 states:

<PRE>   Greater font flexibility. Because the fonts are stored in the
   registry, you can install an unlimited number of TrueType fonts.
   In addition, you can print almost 1000 fonts in any document.

</PRE>This statement is not entirely true. Windows 95 does limit the number of
fonts to approximately 1000 for various reasons not related to registry
size limits. The exact number may vary depending on your configuration.

Page 896: To Install SLIP
<P><h3>Online Help: Configuring a Windows 95 Dial-Up Client</h3>
 
<P>
Step 2 of the "To Install SLIP" bulleted item states: "In the Install From
Disk dialog box, click the Browse button, and then type the path name to
ADM N\APPTOOLS\SLIP\RNAPLUS.INF."
<P>
Step 2 should read: "In the Install From Disk dialog box, click the Browse

<P>
<P><h3>Page 899: Configuring a Windows 95 Dial-Up Server</h3>
 
<P>
This topic states: "Windows 95 must have special registry settings to act
as an IP router."
<P>
This information is incorrect. Microsoft does not support making changes
to the registry to enable Windows 95 to become an IP router. Microsoft
Windows NT Server version 3.5 can act as an IP router, but Microsoft
Windows 95 cannot. Windows 95 provides all the protocols you need to
connect to the Internet, but cannot act as an IP router.
<P>
Page 1019: Getting Started with Registry Editor
<P><h3>Online Help: Getting Started with Registry Editor</h3>
 
<P>
This topic states: "Registry Editor is not available with the Windows 95
floppy disks." Actually, Registry Editor is included on the Windows 95
floppy disks.
<P>
Registry Editor is located in the Win95_03.cab cabinet file for non-DMF
floppy disks, and in the Win95_02.cab cabinet file for DMF floppy disks.

external command.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 1111: Incorrect Directory and Command List</h3>
 
<P>
Under the heading "Commands Not Included in Windows 95," there is a
list of commands located in the Other\Olddos folder on the Windows
95 CD-ROM.
<P>
This folder name is incorrect; it should be Other\Oldmsdos. Also,
some of the commands are not present in this folder.
<P>
BACKUP was a file backup utility included with MS-DOS versions 2.0
through 5.0. It was replaced by MSBACKUP in version 6.0. MSBACKUP is
in the Other\Oldmsdos folder, but BACKUP is not.
<P>
EDLIN was a line-oriented text editor included with MS-DOS versions
2.0 through 5.0. It was replaced by EDIT in MS-DOS version 5.0 and did
not appear at all in MS-DOS 6.0 or later. EDIT is also a Windows 95
command and is explained on page 1103 of the Windows 95 Resource Kit.
<P>

for the Windows 95 version of Xcopy. This switch is only valid for the
Windows NT version of Xcopy.
<P>
<P><h3>Pages 1159-1160: [Version] Section</h3>
 
<P>
Pages 1159-1160 of the Resource Kit state that the Signature line of the
[Version] section is "$Windows 95$." This is incorrect. The Signature line
is actually as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   [Version]
   Signature="$Chicago$"

information.
<P>
