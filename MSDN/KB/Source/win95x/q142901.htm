The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to dial another computer using the Chat tool (Winchat.exe),
you may receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   The other computer did not respond

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the above message for any of the following reasons:

<UL><LI>There is no one at the other computer to answer.

<LI>You are not logged on to the network.

<LI>The other computer is not logged on to the network.

<LI>The two computers are not configured to use a common network protocol.

<LI>When you dialed the other computer, you typed an extra space at the
   end of the computer name.

<LI>The other computer is running Windows 95 and Netdde.exe has not been
   run on that computer during this session.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve the problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure that someone is available at the other computer to answer.

<P><LI>Make sure both computers are logged on to the network.

<P><LI>Double-click the Network icon in Control Panel on each computer, and
   make sure there is a common network protocol in the list of installed
   network components.

<P><LI>Make sure that you do not type an extra space at the end of the name
   of the computer you are calling.

<P><LI>If you are using Windows 95, you must run Netdde.exe before you can
   receive a chat. When you run Winchat.exe, it automatically starts
   Netdde.exe. However, if you have not run Winchat.exe during a session,
   Netdde.exe is not loaded and Chat cannot notify you that another user
   is calling. You may want to place a shortcut to Netdde.exe in your
   Startup folder to prevent this. For information about creating
   shortcuts, search for "shortcut" in Windows 95 Help.
<P>
   NOTE: If you are using only the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks,
   NetBIOS must be enabled in the properties for the IPX/SPX protocol for
   Netdde.exe to load.
