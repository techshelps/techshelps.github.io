The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Even though you disable a device in your computer's CMOS settings, Windows
95 enables the device and consumes its resources. Windows 95 may also
reinstall a device that is removed from Device Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When Windows 95 starts, it examines the resources supplied by your
computer and activates them as needed. Windows 95 detects Plug and Play
devices regardless of the CMOS settings.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent Windows 95 from activating disabled hardware, you must disable
the hardware in the computer's CMOS settings and remove it from the current
configuration in Windows 95. This frees the device's resources for other
devices to use. To disable a device in the current configuration, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control
   Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the System icon.

<P><LI>Click the Device Manager tab, then double-click the device you want
   to disable.

<P><LI>Click the General tab, then click the Original Configuration (Current)
   check box to clear it.

<P><LI>Click the OK button.

<P><LI>Restart Windows 95 when prompted.

<P><LI>Disable the device in your computer's CMOS settings. For information
   about how to disable a device in your computer's CMOS settings,
   please contact your computer's manufacturer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
An example of when you might want to disable a device is when you have a
PS/2-style mouse port in your computer but you are not using a PS/2-style
mouse. This device appears in Device Manager with an exclamation point in a
yellow circle, meaning that the device is not working properly.
<P>
For additional information about this particular issue, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q126632.htm">Q126632</A></B>
   TITLE     : Mouse Detected as PS/2-Style or Bus Does Not Work During
               Setup

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you disable a device in Device Manager, you must restart your
computer before you can reassign the device's resources to another
device, even though you are not prompted to restart Windows 95.
