<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains questions and answers about using Microsoft Exchange
remotely in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. Before upgrading to Windows 95, I used Microsoft Mail Remote
<P><PRE>       version 3.2 with Windows for Workgroups. Can I dial into the
       Microsoft Mail 3.2 Message Transfer Agent (MTA) using the Microsoft
       Exchange client and Dial- Up Networking with Windows 95?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. No. You cannot dial into a Microsoft Mail 3.2 MTA using the
       Microsoft Exchange client, because Microsoft Mail Remote version
       3.2 uses a unique protocol that only the Microsoft Mail Remote
       client can understand. To dial into the MTA, you must install the
       Microsoft Mail Remote client in Windows 95. If you want to use the
       Microsoft Exchange client, you must dial into a Microsoft Windows
       NT Remote Access Server (RAS) or Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking
       server instead of dialing into the MTA server.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How do I configure the Microsoft Exchange client to store my
<P><PRE>       personal information store (.pst file) on a network server?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The Microsoft Exchange client does not have an option to
       automatically store your personal information store on a network
       server. However, you can do so by manually moving the .pst file to
       a network server that you have full access to, and then specifying
       the new location of the personal information store the next time
       you start Microsoft Exchange.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How do I synchronize my personal information stores when I use
<P><PRE>       Microsoft Exchange on multiple computers (for example, on a laptop
       computer that connects to the network using Dial-Up Networking, and
       another computer that is physically connected to the network)?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. To synchronize your personal information stores, use either of the
       following methods:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - Choose one of your personal information stores to use as a
          starting point, and then move that .pst file to a network server
          that you have full access to. The next time you start Microsoft
          Exchange on each of your computers, specify the location of this
          personal information store.

        - Configure your computers to use the Remote Mail feature of
          Microsoft Exchange. Then, when you connect to a server to
          download your new messages, retrieve copies of the messages,
          rather than retrieving the original messages themselves. Once
          you have retrieved copies of a particular message on all of your
          computers, mark the message for deletion so that it will be
          deleted the next time you choose the Transfer Mail option.

          For more information about using the Remote Mail feature of
          Microsoft Exchange, view the Using Microsoft Exchange Remotely
          online Help topic in Microsoft Exchange.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. When I use the Remote Mail feature of Microsoft Exchange, what
<P><PRE>       Microsoft Exchange services can I use to preview my messages?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. You can preview messages with the following Microsoft Exchange
       services:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - The Microsoft Mail service

        - The Microsoft Network Online Service

        - The CompuServe Mail service

        - The Internet Mail service (included with Microsoft Plus! for
          Windows 95)

</PRE><P><LI> Q. What is the difference between the Update Headers and Transfer Mail
<P><PRE>       options in the Remote Mail feature of Microsoft Exchange?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Both of these options download all new message headers from the
       server. The Transfer Mail option also sends any mail that is
       currently stored in your Outbox. In addition, if you have
       previously downloaded message headers and marked some of these
       messages for retrieval, retrieval of a copy, or deletion, the
       Transfer Mail option performs the appropriate action on each of
       these messages.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why am I unable to retrieve mail when my computer is connected to
<P><PRE>       the network, even though I can connect to the Microsoft Exchange
       server and it appears that I can send mail?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The Remote Mail feature of Microsoft Exchange may be enabled. To
       disable this feature, click Services on the Tools menu, click
       Microsoft Mail, click Properties, click the LAN Configuration tab,
       and then click the Use Remote Mail check box to clear it. When this
       check box is selected, you must use the Remote Mail feature of
       Microsoft Exchange to retrieve your new mail. To access the Remote
       Mail tool, click Remote Mail on the Tools menu.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What is the Msremote.sfs folder used for?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. This folder is used by the Microsoft Mail service when you enable
       the Remote Mail feature to store address information when the Use
       Local Copy option is enabled, and to store other user account
       information.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How do I enable Remote Mail for the Internet Mail service that is
<P><PRE>       included with Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. On the Tools menu, click Services, click Internet Mail, click
       Properties, click the Connection tab, and then click the Work Off-
       Line And Use Remote Mail check box to select it.
