The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to manually create hardware profiles for a
laptop computer in docked and undocked states.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 is designed to switch the hardware profile for a laptop
computer when it is docked or undocked if the computer's BIOS is Plug
and Play-compatible or if the computer is connected to one of the
following docking stations:

<UL><LI>Any Texas Instruments
<LI>Any IBM ThinkPad or PS/2
<LI>Any Compaq LTE Lite 4/x
<LI>Toshiba 2000-4900 series
<LI>Any NEC Versa
<P>
</UL>Note that docking or undocking a laptop computer may require shutting
down the computer.
<P>
If your laptop computer is not Plug and Play-compatible or your docking
station is not listed above, you can create hardware profiles for the
computer manually. You can create one hardware profile for when the
computer is docked and one for when it is undocked.
<P>
To create hardware profiles for your computer manually, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Make a list of hardware devices you have access to when the computer
    is docked and when it is undocked.
<P>
    For example, when the computer is docked you may have access to
    another monitor, display adapter, CD-ROM drive and controller,
    network card, pointing device, and sound card.  When the computer is
    undocked you do not have access to these devices.
<P>
    The following is a sample configuration:
<P>
       Docked:
<P>
<PRE>          Sony CD-ROM drive and controller card
          Sound Blaster AWE32 sound card
          Intel Ether Express 16 network adapter
          Logitech Mouse on COM1
          Generic S3 display adapter
          NEC MultiSync 3FX monitor

       Undocked:

          No Sony CD-ROM drive and controller card
          No Sound Blaster AWE32 sound card
          No Intel Ether Express 16 network adapter
          No Logitech Mouse on COM1
          No S3 display adapter
          No NEC MultiSync 3FX monitor
          Microsoft BallPoint mouse
          Standard VGA display adapter
          Laptop Display Panel (800x600)

</PRE><P><LI>Install Windows 95, if it has not already been installed, with the
    computer docked. Windows 95 should detect and configure all the
    hardware devices that can be accessed when the computer is docked.

<P><LI>Configure your desktop and hardware device options as you want them
    to appear when the computer is docked, and verify that all hardware
    devices are working correctly.
<P>
    Using the sample configuration above, you could change the monitor
    type to a NEC MultiSync 3FX and change the screen resolution to
    1024 x 728 with 16.8 million colors.

<P><LI>Rename the Original Configuration hardware profile to Docked. To
    do so, follow these steps:
<P>
    a. In Control Panel, double-click System.
<P>
    b. Click the Hardware Profile tab.
<P>
    c. Click Original Configuration, and then click Rename.
<P>
    d. In the To box, type "Docked" (without quotation marks), and
       then click OK.

<P><LI>Copy the Docked hardware profile to Undocked. To do so, follow these
    steps:
<P>
    a. Click Docked, and then click Copy.
<P>
    b. In the To box, type "Undocked" (without quotation marks), and
       then click OK.
<P>
    c. Click OK.

<P><LI>Remove devices from the Undocked hardware profile that are not
    accessible when the computer is undocked. To do so, follow these
    steps:
<P>
    a. In Control Panel, double-click System.
<P>
    b. Click the Device Manager tab.
<P>
    c. For each device that is not available when the computer is
       undocked, follow these steps:
<P>
       1. Double-click the device in Device Manager.
<P>
       2. On the General tab, click the Undocked check box to clear
<PRE>          it in the Device Usage area.

       3. Click OK.

    Using the sample configuration describes above, the Undocked check
    box would be cleared for the following devices:

       Sony CD-ROM drive
       Sound Blaster AWE32 sound card
       Intel Ether Express 16 network adapter
       Logitech Mouse
       S3 display adapter

</PRE><P><LI>Shut down the computer and then undock it.

<P><LI>Verify that all devices that should be connected to the computer
    when it is undocked are connected, and then start the computer.
    Select the Undocked hardware profile from the configuration menu.

<P><LI>Use the Add New Hardware tool in Control Panel to detect any
    additional hardware that is available when the computer is
    undocked. To run the Add New Hardware tool, follow these steps:
<P>
    a. Press CTRL+ESC to open the Start menu.
<P>
    b. Press the UP ARROW key until Settings is selected.
<P>
    c. Press the RIGHT ARROW key to select Control Panel, and then
       press ENTER.
<P>
    c. Use the ARROW keys to select Add New Hardware, and then press
       ENTER.
<P>
    Using the sample configuration, Windows 95 should detect the
    following new devices:
<P>
       Microsoft BallPoint mouse
       Standard VGA display adapter

<P><LI>When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.

<P><LI>Choose the Undocked hardware profile from the configuration menu.

<P><LI>Configure your desktop and hardware device options as you want them
    to appear when the computer is undocked.
<P>
    For example, you might want to change the display adapter to Laptop
    Display Panel (800 x 600).
<P>
</OL>If you want to install additional devices at a later time, make sure to
install the device in each hardware profile in which you want the device
to be accessible.
