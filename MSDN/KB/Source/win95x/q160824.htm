The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 2, 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS)
to connect to NetWare servers, idle connections to drives mapped to
NetWare servers are disconnected after approximately 10 minutes if there
are connections to more than 8 servers.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is a problem with the MSNDS version of the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks (NWRedir). This client assumes a maximum of eight server
attachments, and automatically disconnects any idle connections to servers
after the first eight.
<P>
This limitation was originally designed for compatibility with older
versions of Novell's NetWare client. However, this limitation does not
apply to Novell's NetWare Directory Services (NDS) clients. In this
respect, MSNDS is not fully compliant with the comparable Novell client.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. A
fix to this problem is in development, but has not been regression tested
and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not
recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information on the availability of this fix.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This symptom has also been observed with the Microsoft Client for NetWare
Networks (bindery version, without MSNDS). Although this behavior is by
design for the bindery client, it can be worked around with the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Obtain and install the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory
   Services (MSNDS). For information about obtaining MSNDS, please
   see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services
                  Available

</PRE><P><LI>Obtain and install the update identified in the "Status" section above.

<P><LI>Configure the MSNDS client to log in to the bindery server instead
   of to an NDS tree. For information about how to do this, see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
