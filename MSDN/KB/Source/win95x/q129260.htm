                                SUMMARY
                                =======

</PRE>This article lists steps to troubleshoot Setup problems and describes the
Windows 95 Setup process for a typical upgrade from an earlier version of
Windows.
<P>
<PRE>                            MORE INFORMATION
                            ================

</PRE><h2>Troubleshooting Setup</h2>
 
<P>
Before you try any of the following steps, create a boot disk for your
current operating system. Copy any files you need to start your computer
(including the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files) to the boot disk. Make
sure to include any necessary device driver files (such as a device driver
that gives you access to the hard disk). For instructions about how to
create a boot disk, please consult your operating system's documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Clean Boot</h3>
 
<P>
If you have problems installing Windows 95, you should first try a clean
boot. If no disk-compression software, disk partitioning software, or
other third-party driver is necessary to start your computer, follow these
steps to try a clean boot:

<OL><P><LI>Rename the Config.sys file to Config.xxx. To do so, type the following
   line at a command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren c:\config.sys config.xxx
</PRE>
<P><LI>Rename the Autoexec.bat file to Autoexec.xxx. To do so, type the
   following line at a command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren c:\autoexec.bat autoexec.xxx
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart your computer and run Setup again.
<P>
</OL>Setup from MS-DOS:
<P>
If disk partitioning, disk compression, or other third-party software
is required to start your computer, the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys
files should appear as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Config.sys
   --------------------------------------
   &lt;Third-party disk partitioner&gt;
   &lt;Third-party disk compression driver&gt;
   &lt;Other required third-party driver&gt;
   shell=c:\&lt;dir&gt;\command.com  /E:1024 /P
   files=45
   buffers=20

   Autoexec.bat
   ---------------
   prompt $p$g
   path=c:\DOS;c:\

</PRE></OL>Setup from Windows:
<P>
If disk partitioning, disk compression, or other third-party software
is required to start your computer, the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys
files should appear as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Config.sys
   -------------------------------------
   device=c:\&lt;dir&gt;\himem.sys
   device=c:\&lt;dir&gt;\emm386.exe x=a000-f7ff nohi noems novcpi nomovexbda notr
   &lt;Third-party disk partitioner&gt;
   &lt;Third-party disk compression driver&gt;
   &lt;Other third-party drivers&gt;
   stacks=9,256
   shell=c:\&lt;dir&gt;\command.com  /E:1024 /P
   files=45
   buffers=20

   Autoexec.bat
   --------------------------
   prompt $p$g
   path=c:\Windows;c:\DOS;c:\
   set temp=c:\&lt;dir&gt;

</PRE>Close all running Windows-based programs (except Program Manager) and
disable 32-bit file and disk access before you run Setup again.
<P>
NOTE: These examples assume you are not running Setup from a network.
If you are running Setup from a network, please consult your network
administrator for information about using a minimal boot.
<P>
<P><h3>ScanDisk Stops Responding (Hangs)</h3>
 
<P>
If your computer hangs while ScanDisk is checking the hard disk for
problems, Setup should return control of the computer to you after three
minutes of inactivity. If Setup does not return control to you, run
ScanDisk from the command prompt, and then run Setup again. If Setup
continues to hang, run Setup with the /IS switch to prevent ScanDisk from
running. When you do this, Setup runs Chkdsk.exe to check for cross-linked
files.
<P>
<P><h3>Setup Hangs</h3>
 
<P>
The most common causes for Setup to hang are viruses and anti-virus
software. If Setup hangs, first run an anti-virus program. If no viruses
are found, check to see if an anti-virus program is resident in memory.
<P>
Some computers include an anti-virus feature that prevents programs from
writing to the boot sector of the hard disk. Such features may be set in
your computer's CMOS settings. If anti-virus protection is running, Setup
cannot finish the installation, or Windows 95 does not load properly.
<P>
To work around this problem, disable the anti-virus feature in your
computer's CMOS settings and then run Setup again. Once you have
successfully completed Setup you can re-enable the anti-virus feature.
For information about how to change CMOS settings on your computer, please
contact your computer manufacturer.
<P>
Setup may also hang if the full (OEM) version of Windows 95 is being
installed onto a clean, bootable SCSI hard disk (for example, the boot
disk that ships with the product is not used. Instead Io.sys, Msdos.sys,
and Command.com are copied to the hard disk).
<P>
During Setup, SMARTDrive is automatically loaded but double-buffering is
not enabled. If Windows 95 is being installed onto a SCSI hard disk that
requires double-buffering, Setup may hang while temporary files are being
copied to the hard disk.
<P>
To work around this problem, run Setup with the /C switch to prevent
SMARTDrive from loading.
<P>
<P><h3>Setup Hangs on Disk 2</h3>
 
<P>
This problem can be caused by either of the following situations:

<UL><LI>Change-line support is not working properly.
<P>
   If Setup cannot read disk 2 after it reads disk 1, try the following
   steps:
<P>
   1. Add the appropriate line to the Config.sys file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      For a 1.44-MB drive A:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         drivparm=/d:0 /f:7

      For a 1.44-MB drive B:

         drivparm=/d:1 /f:7

      NOTE: Because the /C switch is not included in these lines, MS-DOS
      does not depend on change-line support. If the Config.sys file
      contains a Driver.sys line, disable it by placing the REM command at
      the beginning of the line.

   2. Restart the computer and then run Setup again.

   If Setup works correctly, change-line support is not functioning
   properly. Leave the Drivparm statement in the Config.sys file.

   If Setup still does not work correctly, remove the Drivparm statement
   from the Config.sys file and consult the computer's manufacturer to
   make sure that the computer's CMOS settings are correct.

</PRE><LI>You may have bad Setup disks.
<P>
   Disks 2-13 are Distribution Media Format (DMF) disks rather than
   standard MS-DOS-formatted disks. DMF disks can store more information
   than standard MS-DOS-formatted disks. However, some computers may have
   trouble reading DMF disks. If you have a computer that does not read
   DMF disks properly, Setup may not work properly.
<P>
   You can use the following steps to troubleshoot DMF disk issues:
<P>
   1. Copy the Extract.exe file from disk 1 to the root folder of
<P><PRE>      drive C. To do so, type the following line at the command
      prompt:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         copy a:\extract.exe c:\

   2. Create a temporary folder on your hard disk by typing the
      following line at the command prompt:

         md c:\win95tmp

   3. With disk 2 in drive A, extract the Precopy2.cab and Win95_02.cab
      files to the folder you created in step 2. To do so, type the
      following commands:

         extract /e a:\precopy2.cab /l c:\win95tmp
         extract /e a:\win95_02.cab /l c:\win95tmp

      NOTE: You must use the Extract command with all disks (except disk
      1) because they are DMF disks.

      For additional information about using the Extract command, please
      see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

         ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q129605.htm">Q129605</A></B>
         TITLE     : How to Extract Original Compressed Windows Files 

   If you cannot extract these files from disk 2, try to extract a
   different .cab file from a different disk. If you cannot extract any
   .cab file, your computer hardware may not be functioning correctly, or
   your computer may be infected with a computer virus.

   You should run current virus detection software to determine if your
   computer is infected with a virus. If a virus is detected, remove the
   virus from the computer, and then try to extract the files again.

   NOTE: If a virus has infected a Setup disk, the disk cannot be used.
   You will need replacement disks.

   If you are still unable to extract the files after verifying that your
   computer is not infected with a virus, try extracting the files using
   another computer. If you are able to extract the files using another
   computer, you should contact your hardware manufacturer for assistance
   with properly configuring or replacing your malfunctioning computer
   hardware.

   If you encounter problems only when you try to extract certain .cab
   files but you can extract other .cab files, you may need replacement
   disks. Please call (800) 207-7766 or Microsoft Technical Support for
   replacement disks.

   and select different combinations of hardware types. For example,
   select only Display, Floppy Disk Controller, Keyboard, and Mouse.
<P>
</OL><h3>Setup Hangs While Creating the Startup Disk</h3>
 
<P>
Setup may hang or generate a general protection (GP) fault error message
when it tries to create the Startup Disk. This problem may be due to the
presence of a virtual device driver (VxD) from Norton Utilities. To work
around this problem, use either of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Start Setup again. When you are prompted whether you want to create
   a Startup Disk, click No.

<LI>Remove the "device=symevnt.386" line from the [386Enh] section of the
   System.ini file and then run Setup again. Use any text editor (such
   as Notepad or Edit.com) to edit the System.ini file and remove this
   line.
<P>
</UL>If you choose not to create a Startup Disk during Setup, you can create one
after Setup is finished. To do so, follow these steps in Windows 95:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon, then click the Startup
   Disk tab.

<P><LI>Click the Create Disk button to create a Startup Disk.
<P>
</OL><h3>Setup Hangs After the First Reboot</h3>
 
<P>
Setup may hang after the first reboot for one of the following reasons:

<UL><LI>There is a video driver conflict, or an incompatible real-mode hard
   disk driver. Try to start Windows 95 in Safe Mode by following these
   steps:
<P>
   1. Restart Windows 95. Press the F8 key when you see the "Starting
<P><PRE>      Windows 95" message.

</PRE><LI>There may be a damaged Windows 3.1 group (.grp) file. To correct this
   problem, turn your computer off, wait a few seconds, then turn it back
   on. Run the Group Converter tool (Grpconv.exe) to rebuild each .grp
   file individually.
<P>
</UL><h3>"Incorrect System Disk" or "Invalid System Disk" Error Message</h3>
 
<P>
CAUTION: If you are using Disk Manager or any other disk drive overlay
program on a hard disk, make sure that the overlay driver is loaded before
you use the SYS command on that hard disk. If the overlay driver is not
loaded and you use the SYS command on the hard disk, the drive may not be
recognized as being partitioned by the disk drive overlay program and you
could experience a data loss or inability to boot from the drive.
<P>
You can work around this problem by manually installing the Windows 95
system files on the hard disk. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start your computer with the Startup Disk created during Setup.

      attrib c:\msdos.sys +r +s +h
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Setup Hangs on the Second Reboot</h3>
 
<P>
For information about troubleshooting this and other problems in Windows
95, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q119941.htm">Q119941</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Rebuild, Convert, Troubleshoot Folders in Windows
               95

</PRE></OL><h2>Starting Setup</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows 95 can upgrade Windows version 3.0 and higher and
Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 and higher. If you are using Windows
3.0, you must run Setup from MS-DOS. If you are using Windows 3.1 or
Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or higher, you can run Setup from MS-DOS or
Windows.
<P>
Windows 95 can upgrade MS-DOS, PC-DOS, or OEM-DOS version 3.2 and higher.
<P>
<P><h2>Setup Step-by-Step</h2>
 
<P>
Understanding the steps that Setup performs may help you to troubleshoot
problems you encounter during the Setup process. Setup performs the
following steps:
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1 - Initializing Setup</h3>
 
<P>
In this step, Windows 95 prepares your computer for installation by
performing the following functions:

<UL><LI>If you run Setup from MS-DOS, Windows 95 searches the local hard
   disk for a previous version of Windows 3.1 or later. If a previous
   version is found, Setup recommends that you quit Setup and then run
   Setup again from inside the existing Windows version.

<LI>Setup checks for the minimum system configuration.

<LI>Setup checks for an extended memory manager (such as Himem.sys) and
   a disk cache program (such as Smartdrv.exe). If either is not found,
   Setup loads one.

<LI>Setup checks for the presence of "dirty" or "deadly" terminate-and-
   stay-resident programs (TSRs) that are known to cause problems with
   Windows 95 Setup.  Use Setup /IT to ignore this TSR check.

<LI>If you run Setup from MS-DOS, Setup installs the necessary
   components for mini-Windows. Setup stores these files in a
   temporary directory it creates called Wininst0.400.

<LI>Setup runs Scandisk /ALL /NOTEXT to check the hard disk for any
   problems. Use Setup /IS to not run ScanDisk during Setup.

<LI>Setup starts the graphical user interface (GUI) and displays the
   "Welcome to Setup" message. At this point, Setup switches the
   processor into protected mode and makes extended memory
   available.

<LI>If Setup finds an OLD_DOS.X directory, it asks you if you want
   to delete this information to free hard disk space.
<P>
   An OLD_DOS.X directory is created when you install the MS-DOS 6.x
   Upgrade or Step-Up. This directory is used if you decide to remove
   the upgrade and return to your earlier version of MS-DOS. If you did
   not install the MS-DOS 6.x Upgrade or Step-Up, you do not have an
   OLD_DOS.X directory.
<P>
</UL><h3>Step 2 - Preparation for Smart Recovery</h3>
 
<P>
If for any reason Setup does not finish and the computer needs to be
restarted, the following lines in the Autoexec.bat file prompt you to run
Setup again and choose the Smart Recovery option:
<P>
<PRE>   @if exist c:\wininst0.400\suwarn.bat call c:\wininst0.400\suwarn.bat
   @if exist c:\wininst0.400\suwarn.bat del c:\wininst0.400\suwarn.bat

</PRE><h3>Step 3 - Read the Setuplog.txt File</h3>
 
<P>
Setup reads the Setuplog.txt file to see if Setup failed previously. If
Setup did fail previously, Setup prompts you to run Smart Recovery or to
continue using the Full Install option.
<P>
If the Setuplog.txt file is complete and you run Setup from the same
version of Windows, Setup provides a Verify option. Using this option
causes Setup to check the Windows 95 file sizes and dates. If a file is
damaged, Setup re-installs it.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 4 - Gathering Information</h3>
 
<P>
Setup collects information from you (such as your name and the directory
in which to install Windows 95) and writes that information to the
Setuplog.txt file for use when copying files.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 5 - Hardware Detection</h3>
 
<P>
Hardware detection is the most intense portion of Setup. Windows 95
maintains a database of known legacy (non-Plug and Play) devices and the
resources that they use. Setup polls all of these resources (I/O ports,
IRQs, DMA channels, memory addresses, and so on) and looks for responses
to determine what device is using each resource. If Setup detects a Plug
and Play device, it adds that device's configuration information to the
registry.
<P>
Setup creates the registry and puts the System.new, User.new, and
Detlog.txt files in the root directory of drive C. To help speed the
process of searching through the extensive .inf files, Setup uses two
indexing files, Drvidx.bin and Drvdata.bin, from the temporary directory
(Wininst0.400).
<P>
<P><h3>Step 6 - Windows Components</h3>
 
<P>
When you select the components to install (or accept the default
components), Setup writes them to the Setuplog.txt file with the other
Setup information.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 7 - Preparing to Copy Files</h3>
 
<P>
Setup uses the Setupx.dll file to create a list of files to copy based on
the components you selected.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 8 - Copying Files</h3>
 
<P>
If you chose to create a Startup Disk, Setup copies the Startup Disk files
now. Next, Setup copies the files prepared in step 7 to the hard disk.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 9 - Finishing Setup</h3>
 
<P>
After copying all the necessary files, Setup upgrades the existing copy of
Windows and replaces the existing MS-DOS version with the Windows 95
operating system. After Setup reaches 100% complete, it writes information
to the hard disk's master boot record (MBR) and renames the Io.sys and
Msdos.sys files to Io.dos and Msdos.dos. At this point you are prompted to
click the Finish button so that Setup can restart your computer and
complete the installation.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 10 - Configuring Hardware</h3>
 
<P>
Setup updates the configuration files by running Winint.exe to process
the options in the Wininit.ini file. The Wininit.ini file tells Setup to
create the Vmm32.vxd file and to rename the files that were used by Setup
initially but are no longer needed.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 11 - Run-Once</h3>
 
<P>
Setup runs the Run-Once module. This module is specified in the registry
and installs certain device configurations and printers, converts .grp
files to Windows 95 format, sets the time and date, and sets up the Help
system for Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 12 - Second Reboot</h3>
 
<P>
This step does not occur on all computers. Setup may restart your computer
a second time so that it can finalize the hardware settings. This extra
step lets Setup detect hardware that could not be detected during the
original hardware detection.
<P>
For example, if your computer contains a sound card with a built-in SCSI
controller, Setup detects the sound card and SCSI controller during the
initial hardware detection phase. Setup restarts your computer a second
time so that it can load the SCSI enumerator and detect whatever is
attached to the SCSI controller (such as a CD-ROM drive).
