The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks (Nwredir.vxd)
and you log on to a Novell NetWare version 4.x server, login scripts
created with NetWare's NETADMIN or NWADMIN utilities do not run.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft client that is available with Windows 95 can access login
scripts only through NetWare 3.x Bindery-type connections to NetWare
servers. Because the login scripts for NetWare 4.x servers are stored in a
different form, they are not available at logon and cannot be run.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Obtain and install the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory
   Services (MSNDS). For information about obtaining MSNDS, please
   see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q138709.htm">Q138709</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services
                  Available

</PRE><LI>Set the NetWare server to Bindery emulation. Then, use the SYSCON
   utility from a NetWare 3.x server to connect to the NetWare 4.x server
   and create the System and User login scripts that you want to use.
<P>
   For assistance in modifying your NetWare configuration, please consult
   the Novell documentation, your network administrator, or Novell
   Technical Support.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Login scripts are stored differently on NetWare 3.x servers using Bindery
services than they are on NetWare 4.x servers using NetWare Directory
Services (NDS). On a Bindery server the System login script is stored in
the file NET$LOG.DAT in the SYS:PUBLIC directory. The User login scripts
are stored in subdirectories of the SYS:MAIL directory (with names
corresponding to the users' internal IDs, usually 8-digit hexadecimal
numbers) in files named LOGIN. On an NDS server, the Container, Profile,
and User login scripts are stored in the Directory Services database as
properties of the Container, Profile, and User objects.
<P>
Because the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks that is included with
Windows 95 can make only Bindery-type connections to a NetWare 4.x server,
the server must be running Bindery emulation or you must install the
Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS). To emulate a
Bindery-type login, the NET$LOG.DAT and LOGIN files must exist in the
proper directories. These files do not ordinarily exist on a NetWare 4.x
server.
<P>
This behavior also occurs when you log on to a NetWare 4.x server using the
NETX client, or when you use the VLM (NetWare MS-DOS requester) client with
the "Preferred Server" setting (in the NET.CFG file) set to specify the
login server name instead of using the "Preferred Tree" setting to specify
the login tree name.
