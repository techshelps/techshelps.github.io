The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to install a Zoom Comstar 14.4 or 28.8 Plug and Play
modem in Windows 95, you may experience one or more of the following
problems:

<UL><LI>If the COM1 and COM2 ports are already installed and listed in Device
   Manager when you install the modem, the modem may be configured to use
   the COM5 port. This problem is known to occur even when the COM3 and
   COM4 ports are not already installed and listed in Device Manager.

<LI>After you install the modem, the serial port that the modem is
   configured to use is not listed in Device Manager. To determine which
   serial port the modem is configured to use, click the modem in
   Device Manager, and then click Properties.

<LI>You may be unable to communicate with the modem using the ECHO command
   from a command prompt in Windows 95 unless the real-mode drivers that
   came with the modem are installed in the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys
   files.

<LI>You may be unable to establish a connection using the modem with
   HyperTerminal, Dial-Up Networking, Phone Dialer, or any other 32-bit
   communications program.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems are known to occur with the Zoom Comstar 14.4 and 28.8 Plug
and Play modems when they are used with Windows 95. These problems are not
caused by a problem in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
For information about resolving these problems, please contact Zoom
Telephonics.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install a Zoom Comstar 14.4 or 28.8 Plug and Play modem in
Windows 95, the modem is not configured to use the COM3 or COM4 ports
even if those ports are not already installed and listed in Device
Manager. The modem may still function correctly with 32-bit communications
programs when configured to use the COM5 port, but it may not function
correctly with 16-bit communications programs.
<P>
After you have successfully installed the modem, you may be unable to
communicate with the modem using the ECHO command unless the real-mode
drivers that came with the modem are installed. When you use real-mode
drivers for your modem in Windows 95, you are unable to take full
advantage of the 32-bit communications architecture that is available.
For this reason, using real-mode modem drivers in Windows 95 is not
recommended.
<P>
You may also be unable to establish a connection using the modem with 32-
bit communications programs. This problem occurs when the initialization
strings for the Zoom Comstar modem in the registry are incorrect. For
example, one of the initialization strings for the modem should be:
<P>
<PRE>   AT&amp;FE0V0&amp;C1&amp;D2S95=47S0=0&lt;cr&gt;

</PRE>In some cases, the initialization string that is actually placed in the
registry is:
<P>
<PRE>   AT&amp;FE0V0&amp;C1&amp;D2S95&lt;cr&gt;

</PRE>When the initialization strings are truncated in this manner and you
attempt to establish a connection using a 32-bit communications program,
the Modemlog.txt file may indicate that the correct strings were sent to
the modem.
<P>
Zoom Telephonics has a resolution for the initialization string truncation
problem. Please contact Zoom to obtain an updated driver (version 1.2.4,
dated 12/22/95).
