<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Rodney's Funscreen by ActiVision, it asks you to insert
disk 1 even though disk 1 is already in the disk drive. After following the
instructions, Rodney's Funscreen is not completely installed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup program for Rodney's Funscreen is in two parts: a Windows part,
and an MS-DOS part. When it is time to install the MS-DOS part, Rodney's
Funscreen starts the MS-DOS program but does not wait long enough for the
MS-DOS part to finish before trying to continue with the Windows part.
Rodney's Funscreen thinks that the MS-DOS part (which involves removing
disk 1) is finished, when in fact it has not yet started. The Setup program
then allows you to continue through the rest of the setup procedure without
ever finishing the MS-DOS part of the installation.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To install Rodney's Funscreen successfully, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit all programs that are running.

<P><LI>Restart the Setup program.

<P><LI>When the Windows part of the installation prompts you to insert disk 1,
   switch to the MS-DOS part of the installation and follow the
   instructions. To switch to the MS-DOS part of the setup, press ALT+TAB
   or click the MS-DOS button on the taskbar.

<P><LI>When the MS-DOS part of the installation is finished, switch back to
   the Windows part, click the OK button in the message box prompting you
   to reinsert disk 1, and continue with the installation procedure as
   before.
<P>
</OL>If you continue to have problems running or installing Rodney's Funscreen,
please contact ActiVision.
