<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to uninstall Novell's 32-bit network client.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To uninstall Novell's 32-bit network client, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Remove the client in Network properties. To do so, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click Network.
<P>
   b. Click the Novell 32-bit client, and then click Remove.
<P>
   c. Click the Novell 32-bit IPX protocol, and then click Remove.

<P><LI>Add the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks. This step ensures that
   registry entries created by Novell's installation program are
   overwritten. After you install the Microsoft client and restart the
   computer, you can either remove the Microsoft client or leave it
   installed. To add the Microsoft client, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. In Network properties, click Add.
<P>
   b. Click Client, and then click Add.
<P>
   c. In the Manufacturers box, click Microsoft. In the Network Clients
<P><PRE>      box, click Microsoft Client For NetWare Networks, and then click
      OK.
</PRE><P>
   d. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click No.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.
   In the Named box, type "netdef.inf" (without quotation marks), and then
   click Find Now. When the file is found, use the right mouse button to
   click the file, and then click Rename on the menu that appears.
   Rename the file to Netdef.nw.

<P><LI>If Novell's 32-bit client has been installed only once, click the Start
   button, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders. In the Named
   box, type "netdef.bnw" (without quotation marks), and then click Find
   Now. When the file is found, use the right mouse button to click the
   file, and then click Rename on the menu that appears. Rename the file
   to Netdef.inf. This restores the original Netdef.inf file. Shut down
   and restart your computer, and skip the remaining steps in this
   article. If the 32-bit client has been installed more than once, or if
   you are not sure, continue with step 5.

<P><LI>Extract a new copy of the Netdef.inf file from your original Windows 95
   CD-ROM or disks.
<P>
   To extract the Netdef.inf file from the CD-ROM, type the following
   command at a command prompt
<P>
<P><PRE>      extract &lt;drive&gt;:\win95\precopy2.cab netdef.inf /L c:\windows\inf
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.
<P>
   To extract the Netdef.inf file from the floppy disk, type the following
   command
<P>
<P><PRE>      extract &lt;drive&gt;:\precopy2.cab netdef.inf /L c:\windows\inf
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the floppy disk drive. Insert disk
   2 in the floppy disk drive before typing this command.

<P><LI>Shut down and restart your computer.
