The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 1, 2, 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using user profiles and roving profiles, a user's local copy 
of the profile may overwrite the server copy. The local copy may be out of
date or incorrect. The user is not prompted when this occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur in the following situation:

<UL><LI>A user logs on at a workstation that does not contain a local copy 
   of his or her profile, or that contains an outdated local copy of the 
   profile.

<LI>The server copy of the profile is not successfully downloaded when the
   user logs on (for example, because of network problems).

<LI>The user logs off and then logs back on at the same workstation, but 
   this time the server copy of the profile can be accessed.
<P>
</UL>When this situation occurs, the outdated or incorrect local copy of the 
profile overwrites the server copy. The server copy can also be over-
written when the user logs off if the server becomes available at that 
time.
<P>
Windows compares the date and time stamps of the local and server copies 
of the profile when a user logs on. The newer copy of the profile 
overwrites the older copy. In the situation described above, the local 
copy has changed more recently than the server copy. When the profiles 
are reconciled, the newer local copy, although incorrect, overwrites the 
older server copy.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 and 
OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2). An update to address this problem is now 
available, but is not fully regression tested and should be applied only 
to computers experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely 
impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft does not recommend 
implementing this update at this time. Contact Microsoft Technical Support
for additional information about the availability of this update.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This update checks for the sequence of events described above, and prompts
the user before overwriting the server copy of the profile with the local 
copy.
<P>
This behavior can also occur when you are using mandatory profiles. You may
be able to work around this behavior by setting the security permissions on
the User.man file in the user's home folder to read access only.
<P>
This behavior can also be resolved using the update described in this
article. However, the user is not prompted if the local profile is not
synchronize with the mandatory server profile. The server profile is always
used.
<P>
For additional information about using mandatory profiles in Windows 95,
Please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
