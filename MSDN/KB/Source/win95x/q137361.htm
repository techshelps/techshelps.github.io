The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0, 4.01 for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using Dial-Up Networking, you may experience the following
symptoms:

<UL><LI>When you are using Dial-Up Networking or you are attempting to connect 
   to a shared network resource that requires a password, the option to 
   save the password that you are entering may not be available. When you
   are using Dial-Up Networking, this option normally appears as a Save
   Password check box. When you are connecting to a shared network
   resource, this option normally appears as a Save This Password In Your
   Password List check box.

<LI>If you have installed Internet Explorer 4.0 or 4.01, and you click
   Internet Options on the View menu, click the Connection tab, click
   "Connect to the Internet using a modem," and then click Settings, the
   Connect Automatically To Update Subscriptions check box may be 
   unavailable.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if you are not currently logged on to Windows 95.
If you click Cancel in the logon dialog box that appears when Windows 95
is starting, your password cache list file is not opened, and your
passwords cannot be saved.
<P>
This behavior can also occur if you have installed Dial-Up Networking but
the client for Microsoft Networks or the client for NetWare Networks has
not been installed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
When you start Windows 95, do not click Cancel in the logon dialog box. If
you do not have a password, create a new one by typing it in the Password
box, or create a null password by clicking OK. If you create a null
password, you are no longer prompted to log on to Windows 95 when Windows
95 starts. Creating a null password does not prevent other people from
accessing your computer, but does allow you to save your password when you
are using Dial-Up Networking or a shared network resource.
<P>
NOTE: Creating a null password does not allow you to save your Dial-Up
Networking password if you are using user profiles. Using user profiles
prevents the Dial-Up Networking password from being saved.
<P>
To restart Windows 95 so that you receive the logon dialog box, use the
appropriate method.
<P>
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 Not Installed:
<P>
Click Start, click Shut Down, click "Close all programs and log on as a
different user", and then click OK.
<P>
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 Installed:
<P>
Click Start, click Log Off &lt;username&gt;, and then click Yes.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Install the client for Microsoft Networks or the client for NetWare
Networks in Network properties.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Password cache list files are associated with individuals. If you do not
log on to Windows 95, Windows 95 does not know who you are, and cannot
open your password cache list file.
<P>
