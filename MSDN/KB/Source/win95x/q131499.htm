The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 can access most CD-ROM drives in protected mode. However,
unsupported CD-ROM drives must use the real-mode drivers provided by the
vendor. If you use real-mode drivers for your CD-ROM drive, you should use
SMARTDrive to obtain optimum performance with the CD-ROM drive.
<P>
SMARTDrive is a disk-caching tool included with versions of MS-DOS and
Windows. Only version 5.0 of SMARTDrive, included with MS-DOS version 6.2
and Windows 95, can cache CD-ROM drives.
<P>
This article lists CD-ROM drives that require real-mode drivers to either
work in Windows 95 or be detected by Windows 95.
<P>
Real-mode CD-ROM drivers include:

<UL><LI>Drivers that must be loaded in the Config.sys file.

<LI>The Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) driver (or third-party
   equivalent) that must be loaded in the Autoexec.bat file.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Backpack CD-ROM (External/Parallel Port) from Micro Solutions</h3>
 
<P>
The Backpack CD-ROM drive has a proprietary parallel port interface and
is not automatically recognized by Windows 95 or Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0.
Current Backpack CD-ROM drive models can use a 32-bit protected-mode
driver obtainable from the manufacturer for compatibility with Windows
95 and Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0. This driver can be downloaded from the
Software Library at Micro Solutions' Web site at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.micro-solutions.com">http://www.micro-solutions.com</A></B>

</PRE>This 32-bit driver loads under SCSI Devices and appears in Device Manager
in Windows 95 or Control Panel in Windows NT.
<P>
The Backpack CD-ROM drive 16-bit real-mode driver can also be used as an
alternative in Windows 95 if it is loaded in the Config.sys file and
Mscdex.exe (or equivalent) is loaded in the Autoexec.bat file. Early
models of Backpack CD-ROM drives (single-speed model 160550 and double-
speed model 162550) must use the 16-bit driver, as they are not compatible
with Micro Solutions' 32-bit driver. Therefore, these early models of
Backpack CD-ROM drives are not compatible with Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0.
<P>
If Windows 95 or Windows NT still does not access the Backpack CD-ROM
drive, or for information about driver parameters, configuration options,
or Windows NT installation steps, please refer to the driver documentation
or check the Technical Support area of Micro Solutions' Web site at
<B><A HREF="http://www.micro-solutions.com">http://www.micro-solutions.com</A></B> before you call Micro Solutions.
<P>
<P><h3>CD-ROM Drives on Mozart Sound Cards</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 requires that the MOZINIT.SYS real-mode driver be loaded in the
Config.sys file and MSCDEX (or equivalent) be loaded in the Autoexec.bat
file to access the CD-ROM drive. This driver is necessary to set up the
hardware.
<P>
For information about the parameters for MOZINIT.SYS and MSCDEX, please
refer to the drive's documentation or contact the manufacturer.
<P>
<P><h3>Chinon CDS-435 or CDS-535</h3>
 
<P>
When you install Windows 95 on a computer with a Chinon CDS-435 or CDS-535
CD-ROM drive, the hardware detection portion of Setup does not detect the
CD-ROM controller. When Setup is finished, you cannot access the CD-ROM
drive, and the drive is not listed in Device Manager.
<P>
The Chinon CDS-435 and CDS-535 CD-ROM drives use a proprietary SCSI
controller card that is not supported by the Windows 95 protected-mode
SCSI drivers.
<P>
To use the Chinon CDS-435 or CDS-535 CD-ROM drive with Windows 95, use the
real-mode device drivers that are included with the drive.
<P>
For information about installing the device drivers, please refer to
the documentation that is shipped with the drive, or contact Chinon
Technical Support.
<P>
<P><h3>Creative Labs Sound Blaster Value CD4x MK4062</h3>
 
<P>
The CD4x MK4062 is not detected by Windows 95 when connected to the IDE
controller on the sound card. An updated driver, Sbide-95.exe, can be
downloaded from Creative Labs to correct this problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Matsushita or Panasonic CD-ROM Drives on Ensoniq Soundscape Cards</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 cannot detect Matsushita/Panasonic CD-ROM drives if they are
connected to Ensoniq Soundscape sound cards. This is because the Ensoniq
sound card offers different I/O ports for the Matsushita/Panasonic
interface than the Windows 95 Panasonic CD-ROM driver supports. The real-
mode drivers for these drives must be used.
<P>
<P><h3>Media Vision Reno</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 cannot access this CD-ROM drive without the real-mode driver
being loaded in the Config.sys file and MSCDEX (or equivalent) being
loaded in the Autoexec.bat file.
<P>
If Windows 95 still does not access the CD-ROM drive, or for information
about the parameters for the real-mode CD-ROM driver and MSCDEX, please
refer to the drive's documentation or contact the manufacturer.
<P>
<P><h3>NEC CDR-38, NEC CDR-250, CDR-260, CDR-260R, CDR-260GW</h3>
 
<P>
The NEC CDR-38, NEC CDR-250, CDR-260, CDR-260R, and CDR-260GW CD-ROM
drives are incompatible with the ATAPI specification version 1.2.
Therefore, Windows 95 cannot detect these drives if NEC_IDE.SYS is not
loaded in the Config.sys file and MSCDEX (or equivalent) is not loaded
in the Autoexec.bat file. After Windows 95 detects these drivers, it uses
protected-mode drivers to access the CD-ROM drive.
<P>
For information about the parameters for NEC_IDE.SYS and MSCDEX, please
refer to the drive's documentation or contact the manufacturer.
<P>
<P><h3>NEC 55-JD</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 cannot access this CD-ROM drive without the real-mode driver
being loaded in the Config.sys file and MSCDEX (or equivalent) being
loaded in the Autoexec.bat file.
<P>
If Windows 95 still does not access the CD-ROM drive, or for information
about the parameters for the real-mode CD-ROM driver and MSCDEX, please
refer to the drive's documentation or contact the manufacturer.
<P>
<P><h3>Philips CD-ROM on Media Vision Fusion 16 Sound Card</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 cannot access this CD-ROM drive when it is attached to a Media
Vision Fusion 16 sound card without the real-mode driver being loaded in
the Config.sys file and MSCDEX (or equivalent) being loaded in the
Autoexec.bat file.
<P>
If Windows 95 still does not access the CD-ROM drive, or for information
about the parameters for the real-mode CD-ROM driver and MSCDEX, please
refer to the drive's documentation or contact the manufacturer.
<P>
<P><h3>Philips CM205 and CM206 Proprietary CD-ROM Drives</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 cannot access this CD-ROM drive without the real-mode driver
being loaded in the Config.sys file and MSCDEX (or equivalent) being

If Windows 95 still does not access the CD-ROM drive, or for information
about the parameters for the real-mode CD-ROM driver and MSCDEX, please
refer to the drive's documentation or contact the manufacturer.
<P>
MediaVision has released a Windows 95 driver for the Phillips CM205/206
CD-ROM drives. Obtain the 206w95.exe file from the MediaVision Web site
(www.mediavis.com) or FTP server (ftp.mediavis.com).
<P>
<P><h3>Pinnacle Micro PCD-100</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 may detect this single-speed drive as a Mitsumi CD-ROM drive
(because it loads MTMCDD.SYS in the Config.sys file) and load the
protected-mode Mitsumi drivers. These drivers do not work with the
Pinnacle CD-ROM drive. To enable the CD-ROM drive, you must reload
MTMCDD.SYS and MSCDEX (or equivalent).
<P>
For information about the parameters for the real-mode CD-ROM driver and
MSCDEX, please refer to the drive's documentation or contact the
manufacturer.
<P>
