The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
One or more of the following problems occurs when you use Program Manager
with Windows 95:

<UL><LI>When you use the mouse to drag a link from the Windows 95 desktop to a
   Program Manager group, the item description is truncated to eight
   characters.

<LI>When you copy a link or item from the desktop to Program Manager, the
   item's icon is lost.

<LI>You cannot drag an item from a Program Manager group to the Windows 95
   desktop.

<LI>You cannot copy the My Computer, Network Neighborhood, Control Panel,
   or Printers folders to a Program Manager group. The Info Center folder
   can be copied to the group, but it does not work properly because of an
   "Invalid Path" error.

<LI>Changes to the Start menu, either performed manually or performed
   automatically by an installation program, are not reflected in
   Program Manager group files.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Although Program Manager ships with Windows 95, it has not been updated
from the previous version of Microsoft Windows; therefore, you may
encounter several issues while using Program Manager. It is provided to
ease the transition from Program Manager to the Windows 95 desktop.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Truncated Description</h3>
 
<P>
Program Manager uses the filename minus the extension when you take
advantage of the drag-and-drop capability to create an icon. For example,
if you drag the MS-DOS Prompt link from the Desktop to a Program Manager
group, the MS-DOS Prompt description is shortened to "MS-DOSPR." This
occurs because the MS-DOS Prompt link uses the MS-DOS name "MS-DOSPR.LNK."
<P>
To work around this issue, manually edit the description of the item by
choosing the item and then clicking Properties from the File menu on
Program Manager's menu bar.
<P>
<P><h3>Lost Icon</h3>
 
<P>
The icon that is created in the Program Manager group is referencing a file
with an .LNK extension. Program Manager has no knowledge of such an
extension; therefore, you get a generic icon.
<P>
To work around this issue, manually change the selected icon by performing
the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the item.

<P><LI>On the Program Manager File menu, click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Change Icon button.

<P><LI>Click OK when you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The path "%1" is invalid.
</PRE><P>
   Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
   here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

<P><LI>Type the path to the icon you want to use or select an icon from the
   choices given, then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Cannot Perform Drag-and-Drop from Program Manager to Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
Program Manager is not designed to provide drag-and-drop functionality from
its groups to the Windows 95 desktop.
<P>
This is expected behavior for Windows 95; therefore, there is no
workaround.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Copy Folders to a Program Manager Group</h3>
 
<P>
The folders that are created when you install Windows 95 are not designed
to work with Program Manager. Program Manager recognizes files only.
<P>
This is expected behavior for Windows 95; therefore, there is no
workaround.
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to Start Menu</h3>
 
<P>
Although Windows 95 automatically updates the Start menu with changes to
Program Manager group files, the reverse does not occur. If you want
changes to the Start menu to be reflected in Program Manager group files,
you must perform the changes manually.
