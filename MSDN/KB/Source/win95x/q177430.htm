The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the error messages you might encounter as you
install DirectX 5.0. DirectX 5.0 is the latest version of a suite of
components that enhance performance by accessing hardware features
directly.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
DirectX 5.0 uses Dsetup.dll to control the installation of DirectX 5.0.
If there is a problem during installation, you can use the following error
codes to begin to diagnose the problem. For some error messages,
suggestions for troubleshooting are provided.
<P>
<P><h3>1</h3>
 
<P>
(SETUP_SUCCESS-RESTART) Setup of DirectX 5.0 was successful and Setup
prompts for a restart of the computer. This message should not be
displayed.
<P>
<P><h3>0</h3>
 
<P>
(SETUP_SUCCESS) Setup of DirectX 5.0 was successful. This message should
not be displayed.
<P>
<P><h3>-1</h3>
 
<P>
(BADWINDOWSVERSION) DirectX cannot be run on this version of Windows. This
version of Windows is either Windows 3.x or a version of Windows NT that
does not support this version of DirectX. Please do not attempt to install
DirectX except in these operating systems.
<P>
DirectX is designed to work with Windows 95 or later and Windows NT 4.0
and later only.
<P>
This error message can also occur if the computer hardware is incompatible
with this version of DirectX. For example, the NEC PC-98 is supported by
DirectX 5.0, but the PC-98 drivers folder is required for installation.
<P>
<P><h3>-2</h3>
 
<P>
(SOURCEFILENOTFOUND) Setup could not find one of the DirectX files it is
trying to install in its source folder.
<P>
This error message may occur if you remove the CD-ROM containing the
DirectX Setup files. Replace the CD-ROM and restart the installation of
DirectX.
<P>
<P><h3>-3</h3>
 
<P>
(BADSOURCESIZE) Setup detected a file it was attempting to install with a
different size from the file shipped with DirectX 5.0.
<P>
A file may be damaged. Check with the provider of DirectX (such as the
game manufacturer if DirectX came on a CD-ROM). If you downloaded DirectX,
download the DirectX files again. You can download DirectX from Microsoft
for free from the following Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/download.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/directx/download.asp</A></B>

</PRE>Run Setup again.
<P>
<P><h3>-4</h3>
 
<P>
(BADSOURCETIME) Setup detected a file it was attempting to install with a
different date from the file shipped with DirectX 5.0.
<P>
A file may be damaged. Check with the provider of DirectX (such as the
game manufacturer if DirectX came on a CD-ROM). If you downloaded DirectX,
download the DirectX files again. You can download DirectX from Microsoft
for free from the following Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/download.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/directx/download.asp</A></B>

</PRE>Run Setup again.
<P>
<P><h3>-5</h3>
 
<P>
(NOCOPY) Setup was unable to copy a file.
<P>
The DirectX source disk may not be available. A file may be damaged. Run
Setup again.
<P>
<P><h3>-6</h3>
 
<P>
(OUTOFDISKSPACE) Setup detected there was not enough disk space to install
DirectX 5.0.
<P>
Attempt to install to a different drive, or clear space from your
destination drive and run DirectX Setup again.
<P>
<P><h3>-7</h3>
 
<P>
(CANTFINDINF) Setup could not find one of the .inf files used to install
DirectX 5.0 (for example, the Directx.inf or Ddraw.inf file).
<P>
The DirectX source disk may not be available. A file may be damaged. Run
Setup again.
<P>
<P><h3>-8</h3>
 
<P>
(CANTFINDDIR) Setup could not find a folder needed to install DirectX 5.0.
<P>
Verify that the source folder still exists and is available for the
DirectX installation files. If not, download DirectX and Run Setup again.
<P>
<P><h3>-9</h3>
 
<P>
(INTERNAL) Setup detected an internal error. There are only two situations
known to cause this error message:

<UL><LI>Dsetup.dll could not load the Dsetup32.dll and Dsetup16.dll files.

<LI>Setup attempted to call a unicode version of Setup Advanced Programming
   Interfaces (APIs), which are not implemented.
<P>
</UL>If you receive this error message, rename the Dsetup16.dll and
Dsetup32.dll files. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

<P><LI>Type the following line in the Named box, and then click Find Now:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dsetup16.dll
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click the file, and then click Rename on the File menu.

<P><LI>Change the name to a .dxx extension. The file name should read as
   follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Dsetup16.dxx
</PRE>
<P><LI>Repeat steps 2-4 for the Dsetup32.dll file.

<P><LI>Reinstall DirectX.
<P>
</OL><h3>-13</h3>
 
<P>
(NOTPREINSTALLEDONNT) Setup detected that it could not install DirectX in
Windows NT because it did not detect an earlier version previously
installed. Setup checks the version of Windows NT, and if it detects
Windows NT 4.0 or later, it expects an earlier version of DirectX to be
previously installed.
