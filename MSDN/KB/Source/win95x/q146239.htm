<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a copy of the information in the Admin.doc file
included with Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1 (part 2 of 3).
<P>
Note that this article reflects the text of a static document.  Therefore,
some of the information in this article may be outdated.  For example, as
of May 20, 1996, Microsoft no longer maintains support forums on
CompuServe.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P>
The following section is for system administrators who want to install the
updates on:
<P>
Multiple computers running Windows 95
A Windows 95 network installation site from which users can install Windows
<P>
95
A network site from which users are running Windows 95
<P>
<P>
Notes to Administrators
Instruct your users not to click Cancel during Setup, as doing so can cause
<P>
Setup to be incomplete. This may be true even though a message is displayed
<P>
stating that their system was updated successfully.
<P>
If your users do cancel Setup by mistake, they can run Setup again. Your
users might be prompted "Do you want to overwrite the file:" choosing "Yes
To All" will resolve the problem.
During Update the Service Pack version of Net.exe is also copied to
Netpwl.exe.  This file can be used if Net.exe is overwritten.  Net.exe may
be overwritten by network setup while adding or removing network
components.
<P>
The Update installation program changes the version of Windows 95 to
4.00.950a.
<P>
<P>
Removing the update from a computer
<P>
All updates except the Password List Update will be removed. The newer
Password List Update must be preserved because the original Password List
decryption program cannot read the new password list. If you would like to
uninstall the Service Pack completely, you should reinstall Windows 95 from
<P>
your original upgrade disk over the existing Windows 95 installation.
<P>
Users should not attempt to cancel during the uninstall process. Otherwise
they might get a message stating uninstall has completed successfully when
actually uninstall has not completed.
If your version of Windows 95 was installed by your PC Manufacturer (OEM
version) and the version shown in the System properties in Control Panel is
<P>
version 4.0.950a, then your PC already has all the core Service Pack 1
files installed by default. If you install the Service Pack 1 Updates over
an OEM version 4.0.950a, and then uninstall it, the uninstallation routine
will remove all the registry update entries (UPDxxxx) from the updates
section. This does not affect operation of the operating system, and the
uninstall will just replace the files with identical versions. These update
<P>
registry keys are not used by the operating system, just by the Update
Information Tool installed as part of the Service Pack and other updated
files.
The system version will remain 4.00.950a.
<P>
To remove the update from a computer

<OL><P><LI>  Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel.
<P>
   2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>Click the Install/Uninstall tab, select Windows 95 Service Pack
   1, and then click Add/Remove.
<P>
   4. Follow the instructions on your screen.
<P>
<P>
</OL>Updating Multiple Computers Running Windows 95
If your users are running Windows 95 from their hard disks (rather than
from a network server), they can update their computers by double-clicking
the Update file. This section explains several ways to make this file
available to your users for easy installation.
<P>
There are two versions of the Update file, to provide you with the
flexibility to choose the amount of user interaction required to install
the Update:
<P>
Setup.exe is located in the \Admin\Componts\Updates\Prompted folder. The
user is required to respond whether they would like to install the update.
They also will be reminded to restart the system after the update has been
installed.
<P>
Sp1upd.exe is located in the \Admin\Componts\Updates\Silent folder. The
user will see the File Copy interface, but will not be prompted to restart
the system. The updates will take effect after restart.
<P>
<P>
Note
If you are using a server-based setup, or if you are running a shared
installation of Windows 95 on a central server (for example, a remote IPL),
<P>
see "Updating Computers that Are Running Windows 95 from a Network Server"
later in this document.
<P>
To make it easy for your users to install the Service Pack updates
You can use one of the following methods:
<P>
Embed the Update file in an e-mail message that you send to your users. In
the message, instruct them to double-click it.
<P>
Copy the Update file from the Service Pack 1 CD to a publicly available
folder on your network server. Then, either you can:
Embed a shortcut to the Update file (on the server) in an e-mail message to
<P>
your users, and instruct them to double-click update file, or you can
Instruct your users to connect the folder where you copied the Update file
and double-click the file.
<P>
Instruct your users to connect directly to the network server and double-
click the Update file.
<P>
Use Microsoft Systems Management Server or another automation tool to
distribute and run the Update file. There is an SMS folder under
\Admin\Tools to assist with the process.
<P>
Incorporate the Update file into a network login script, so that when your
users log in to your network, their systems are automatically updated.
<P>
Use Apps.ini file and add/remove components. See the Microsoft Windows 95
Resource Kit, Chapter 22, for more information about installing
applications. There is also a sample Apps.ini file in the
\Admin\Tools\Infgen\Addon\Extras folder on the Service Pack CD.
<P>
Create a "Run Once" System Policy (Config.pol) on the login  server that
points to the Update file you want to run. See the Microsoft Windows 95
Resource Kit, Chapter 15, for more information about system policies. You
should note that the update will attempt to run once each time a user logs
in to the network until the policy is changed.
<P>
<P>
Note
If your site uses Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Mail shared folders,
each user must reconfigure Microsoft Exchange to use shared folders. For
more information, see the second procedure in "Updating a Single Computer"
earlier in this document.
<P>
For more information about the Microsoft Systems Management Server and
other automation tools, see the "Installation" chapter of the Microsoft
Windows 95 Resource Kit.
<P>
Updating a Windows 95 Network Installation Site
<P>
This section explains how to update a Windows 95 network distribution
point-a network server from which users can install Windows 95. After you
have updated the distribution point, future installations of Windows 95
using that network distribution point will include all the Windows95
Service Pack updates. (If your site uses shared folders with Microsoft
Exchange and Microsoft Mail, any future installations of Windows 95 with
Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Mail will be properly configured to use
shared folders.)
<P>
To update a Windows 95 network installation site
<P>
<PRE>   1. Open  the \Admin\Tools\Infinst folder.

   2. Double-click the Infinst.exe file.

</PRE><P><LI>In the Server Path dialog box, type the path to your Windows 95
   network installation site. Precede the path with two
   backslashes (\\). For example, if your Windows 95 installation
   site is on a server named Products in a shared subdirectory of
   the Windows directory, you would type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\Products\Public\Windows
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the Open dialog box, open the
   \Admin\Componts\Updates\Netsetup folder, and then double-click
   the Updates1.inf file. (Do not double-click the Mapisvc.inf
   file; doing so will cause Infinst.exe to fail.)
<P>
</OL>Note
When machines are installed from the installation site, the users will not
be given the option to uninstall the Service Pack updates.
<P>
Updating Computers that Are Running Windows 95 from a Network Server
<P>
If your users are running Windows 95 from a network server rather than from
<P>
their hard disks, you must use the procedures in this section to update
their systems. (To use the procedures in this section, you must have run
Netsetup to create a Windows 95 distribution directory on the network.)
<P>
<P>
Note
You should follow these instructions only if your users are running Windows
<P>
95 from a network server. If your users are running Windows 95 from their
hard disks, see "Updating Multiple Computers Running Windows 95" earlier in
<P>
this document.
<P>
You should not allow your users to install the Windows Service Pack 1
Updates using Setup.exe or Sp1upd.exe.  This may cause Net.exe to be
renamed to Netpwl.exe, which will prevent users from starting Windows 95.
<P>
The following procedure copies all of the Service Pack update files onto
your network server, and then updates your MSbatch.inf file to include the
necessary updates to the Windows 95 registry.
<P>
To update a Windows 95 sharepoint (from which users run Windows 95)

<OL><P><LI>Have your users shut down their computers. If a user is running
   Windows 95 from your network server during the update process,
   some files might not get updated.
<P>
   2. Open the \Admin\Tools\Infinst folder.
<P>
   3. Double-click the Infinst.exe file.

<P><LI>In the Server Path dialog box, type the path to the directory
   that contains your network installation of Windows 95. Precede
   the path with two backslashes (\\). For example, if your
   Windows 95 installation is on a server named Products in a
   shared subdirectory of the Windows directory, you would type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\Products\Public\Windows
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the Open dialog box, open the
   \Admin\Componts\Updates\Netsetup folder, and then double-click
   the Updates1.inf file. (Do not double-click the Mapisvc.inf
   file; doing so will cause Infinst.exe to fail.)
<P>
</OL>After updating your Windows 95 network sharepoint, you need to update each
user's computer as well. To do this, have each user run the Sclntupd.exe
file. Sclntupd.exe updates the user's Windows 95 registry and copies
Net.exe to their startup drive. (Net.exe is required for network access
when starting Windows 95 from the network.)
<P>
<P>
Note
If your site uses Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Mail shared folders,
each user must reconfigure Microsoft Exchange to use shared folders. For
more information, see "Updating a Single Computer" earlier in this
document.
<P>
For more information about the Microsoft Systems Management Server and
other automation tools, see the "Installation" chapter of the Microsoft
Windows 95 Resource Kit.

Batch Setup Version 2.0
<P>
This section explains how to install Batch Setup version 2.0 and describes
some of the features in this version of Batch Setup. For more information
about creating scripts for Windows 95 Setup, see Chapter 5 of the Microsoft
<P>
Windows 95 Resource Kit.
<P>
To install Batch Setup version 2.0
<P>
<PRE>   1. On the Windows 95 Service Pack 1 CD, open the \Admin\Tools\Batch
      folder.

   2. Double click Setup.exe, and then follow the instructions on your
      screen.

</PRE></OL>Batch Setup version 2.0 includes the following new features:
<P>
You can have Batch Setup scan your Windows 95 registry and create an .inf
file based on your current settings. For more information about which
registry settings Batch Setup can retrieve, search Batch Setup Help.

<P>
INF Generator Tool
<P>
This section describes how to install the INF Generator Tool. The INF
Generator utility can be used to assist in preparing for automatic
installation of Windows 95 in the corporate networking environment. Using
this utility, you can specify separate settings for the company, the
department, and the individual user when installing Windows95. This is
especially useful when static TCP/IP configuration settings are used rather
<P>
than automatic Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) configuration.
For more information, see Infgndoc.doc in the \Admin\Tools\Infgen folder.
<P>
To install the INF Generator Tool

</OL>Windows NT Server Management Tools for Windows 95
<P>
Windows 95 Service Pack 1 provides a set of tools that system
administrators can use to manage Windows NT(tm) servers from a Windows 95
desktop. The set includes the basic Windows NT Server tools (Server
Manager, User Manager, and Event Viewer). These tools run only with Windows
<P>
95 and can be used only in conjunction with Windows NT servers.
<P>
To install the NT Server Management Tools on a computer running Windows 95
<P>
<PRE>   1. Make sure drive C has at least 2.5 MB of free space.

</PRE><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs, and then
   click the Windows Setup tab.

<P><LI>Click Have Disk, and then specify the \Admin\Tools\Servmgmt
   folder.
<P>
   4. Select the Windows NT Server Tools box.

<P><LI>Click Install. The Windows NT Server Tools will be copied to
   the C:\Srvtools directory.

<P><LI>If you anticipate running the Windows NT Server Tools from the
   Run dialog box, or from the MS-DOS(tm) command prompt, edit the
   Path= command in the Autoexec.bat file so that it includes the
   C:\Srvtools directory, and then restart your computer so that
   the new Path setting can take effect.
<P>
</OL>For information about using Windows NT Server Tools, see the Srvtools.txt
document, which is located in the \Admin\Tools\ServMgmt folder.
<P>
INF Installer Tool
<P>
The INF Installer tool, Infinst.exe, can be used to integrate .inf files
and related files from the various tools directories in the Admin directory
<P>
on the Windows 95 CD. This is an updated version from the one that shipped
with the Windows 95 CD or the Windows 95 Resource Kit and should be used
instead of the older version.
<P>
To install the INF Installer
<P>
Copy the Infinst.exe file to your hard disk from the \Admin\Tools\Infinst
folder.
<P>
Using the INF Installer
<P>
Infinst.exe is a tool that is used to add various external components, such
<P>
as MSNDS or MSDLC32, into a network installation of Windows 95 and
(optionally ) force the installation of the components using a batch
script. INFINST accomplishes this by integrating the .inf files of the
external components into the network installation tree of Windows 95 and by
<P>
updating the MSbatch.inf file located in the root of the Server-based Setup
<P>
directory.
<P>
In addition to MSbatch.inf, INFINST also modifies the Layout.inf and
Custom.inf files in the Server-based Setup directory. This prevents the
user from having to make manual modifications in most instances and insures
<P>
that the installation of an external component is successful.
<P>
If the component being integrated is an application, an entry is added to
the [Optional Components] section of  MSbatch.inf. If the component is a
network service, then the Services entry in the [Network] section of
MSbatch.inf is updated with the newly added service.
<P>
Consult Appendix D of the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit for information
<P>
about the entries in the batch INF setup scripts.
<P>
More Information
The following example is a step-by-step procedure for using  Infinst.exe to
<P>
add an external component to a Server-based Setup of Windows 95:

<OL><P><LI>Create a  network installation of Windows 95, which is more
   commonly referred to as a Server-based setup. This can be
   accomplished by using the NETSETUP utility located on the
   Windows 95 CD in the Admin\Nettools\Netsetup directory.
   NETSETUP must be run before INFINST can be used. For more
   information about Server-based Setup, see the main Server-based
   Setup topic in the Windows 95 Resource Kit Help file
   (Win95rk.hlp).

<P><LI>Run Infinst.exe, located in the \Admin\Tools\Infinst
   subdirectory on the Windows 95 Service Pack CD.

<P><LI>Click the Set Path button and type the path to the location of
   the Server-based Setup directory created in step 1. This will
   tell INFINST where to copy the external component files, as
   well as the location of the MSbatch.inf file that needs to be
   modified.

<P><LI>Click the Install INF button and change to the location of the
<P><PRE>      external component directory. For example, if you were
      installing MSDLC32, you would change to the location of the
      MSDLC32 files located on the Service Pack CD in the
      Admin\Componts\MSDLC32 subdirectory.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select the appropriate INF file for the component being
   installed, and then click OK. Again using MSDLC32 as an
   example, the file to highlight would be Netdlc32.inf (Rename
   Netdlc32.sbs to Netdlc32.inf first). Clicking OK will copy and
   modify the necessary files to integrate MSDLC32 into a Server-
   based installation of Windows 95.
<P>
</OL>Note
Although MSDLC32 was used in the above example, you should still refer to
the documentation included with the MSDLC32 component for Server-based
setup information. The above information is only an example of using
Infinst.exe and might not contain all the necessary information for a
successful automated install.
