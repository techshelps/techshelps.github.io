<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to install an internal modem in a computer
running Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To install an internal modem in a computer running Windows 95, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Physically configure the modem to use the appropriate serial port, I/O
   address range, and interrupt request (IRQ) line. Be sure to choose a
   serial port, an I/O address range, and an IRQ line that is not already
   in use by another device. For information about how to configure the
   modem, consult the documentation included with the modem, or contact
   the modem's manufacturer.
<P>
   NOTE: If the modem is a Plug and Play modem, you do not need to
   physically configure the modem to use a specific serial port, I/O
   address range, or interrupt request (IRQ) line. However, depending on
   the configuration of the existing legacy (non-Plug and Play) devices
   in your computer, installing the Plug and Play modem may create a
   resource conflict that prevents the modem from functioning properly.
   To work around this behavior, configure the legacy devices to use a
   different I/O address range or IRQ line, or configure the computer so
   that the appropriate I/O address range or IRQ line is reserved for the
   legacy device.

<P><LI>If the modem is configured to use a serial port that physically exists
   in your computer, disable the serial port in your computer's CMOS
   settings. For example, if the modem is configured to use the COM2 port
   and your computer contains two physical serial ports, COM2 must be
   disabled in your computer's CMOS settings. For information on how to
   disable the serial port, consult the documentation included with your
   computer, or contact the computer's manufacturer.
<P>
   NOTE: If your computer contains a Plug and Play BIOS, disabling a
   serial port in the computer's CMOS settings may not free the resources
   that the serial port is configured to use. This may create a resource
   conflict between the serial port and the modem and may prevent the
   modem from functioning properly. To work around this behavior, use
   either of the following methods:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Physically configure the modem to use a serial port that does not
      exist in the computer. For example, if your computer contains two
      physical serial ports, configure the modem to use the COM3 port.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: In addition to configuring the modem to use a different serial
      port, you may need to physically configure the modem to use a
      different IRQ. The COM1 and COM3 ports and the COM2 and COM4 ports
      are configured to use the same IRQ line by default. If a modem is
      configured to use COM1 or COM2 and is conflicting with the serial
      port that it is configured to use, configuring the modem to use COM3
      or COM4 may not eliminate the conflict.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Reinstall Windows 95 using the following command:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         setup /p i

      The "/p i" switch causes Setup not to report the existence of a Plug
      and Play BIOS. When you disable the serial port in your computer's
      CMOS settings after using this command to reinstall Windows 95, the
      resources that the serial port is configured to use are freed. For
      more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
      Knowledge Base:

</PRE><P><LI>Turn off your computer, insert the modem in an open slot, and then turn
   the computer back on.

<P><LI>If the modem is not detected automatically when Windows 95 starts, run
   the Install New Modem Wizard. To do so, use the following steps.
<P>
   NOTE: Follow these steps only if the modem is not detected
   automatically. If the modem is detected as a standard modem type or is
   detected incorrectly, skip to step 5. If the modem is detected, but
   you are prompted to select which driver you want to install, skip to
   step 6.
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click Modems.
<P>
   b. If you do not already have a modem installed in your computer, the
<P><PRE>      Install New Modem Wizard starts automatically. If you already have a
      modem installed in your computer, click Add to start the Install New
      Modem Wizard.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      To install the modem after the Install New Modem Wizard starts,
      click the "Don't detect my modem..." check box to clear it, and
      then click Next.
</PRE><P>
   If the modem is still not detected, the resources that the modem is
   configured to use may conflict with the resources being used by another
   device. To work around this behavior, eliminate the resource conflict
   by configuring one of the devices to use different resources.

<P><LI>If the modem is detected, but Windows 95 is unable to accurately
   identify the modem, a standard modem driver or other incorrect modem
   driver may be installed. If this occurs, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click Modems.
<P>
   b. If you do not already have a modem installed in your computer, the
<P><PRE>      Install New Modem Wizard starts automatically. If you already have a
      modem installed on your computer, click the Add button to start the
      Install New Modem Wizard.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      After the Install New Modem Wizard starts, click the "Don't detect
      my modem..." check box to select it, and then click Next.
</PRE><P>
   c. In the Manufacturers box, click the manufacturer of the modem. If
<P><PRE>      the specific modem you are installing appears in the Models box,
      click the modem and then follow the instructions on the screen.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      If the manufacturer of the modem does not appear in the
      Manufacturers box or the specific modem does not appear in the
      Models box, Windows 95 does not include a driver for your modem. To
      use the modem in Windows 95, use the standard modem driver or
      contact the manufacturer of the modem to inquire whether a
      protected-mode driver that is compatible with Windows 95 is
      available.
</PRE>
<P><LI>If Windows 95 is able to accurately identify the modem but determines
   that the modem is not supported by the drivers included with Windows
   95, you are prompted to select which driver you want to install for the
   modem. The following options are available:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Driver from disk provided by hardware manufacturer
    - Do not install a driver (Windows will not prompt you again)
    - Select from a list of alternate drivers
</PRE><P>
   If you have a disk from the modem's manufacturer that contains Windows
   95 drivers, click the "Driver from disk provided by hardware
   manufacturer" option. If you have information from the manufacturer
   that this modem emulates another modem Windows 95 supports, click the
   "Select from a list of alternate drivers" option and select the
   appropriate modem from the list.
<P>
   NOTE: The prompt described above is typically displayed when an
   unsupported Plug and Play modem is installed in the computer. If you
   installed an unsupported Plug and Play modem and configured Windows 95
   to use a driver included with Windows 95, you can configure Windows 95
   to use a driver provided by the hardware manufacturer instead. To do
   so, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click System.
<P>
   b. Click the Device Manager tab, click the modem, and then click
<P><PRE>      Remove. Note that some Plug and Play modems may appear on the Other
      Devices branch in Device Manager instead of the Modem branch.
</PRE><P>
   c. Turn the computer off, wait a few seconds, and then turn it back on.
<P>
   d. When you are prompted to select which driver you want to install for
<P><PRE>      the modem, click the "Driver from disk provided by hardware
      manufacturer" option.
