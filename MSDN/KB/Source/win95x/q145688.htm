WELCOME to POWERTOYS
 
This folder contains a series of "PowerToys"-- UI enhancements for advanced
Windows 95 users that can easily be installed on Windows 95.
<P>
These enhancements were developed by members of the Microsoft Win95 team,
and are now being made available to Win95 users at no cost. NOTE: these are
not part of any shipping retail product at this point in time, and
therefore are not supported through any official support channels. Use "at
your own risk". (See official disclaimer below.)
<P>
The contents of this folder will be updated over time as we make
enhancements to the utilities you see here now, and as we add new utilities
for people to try out. Stop back every now and then and see what's changed.
<P>
Here's what's available now:
<P>
*** TapiTNA(telephony taskbar notification application)
<P>
If you use the telephone dialer application from several locations (e.g.
from a laptop computer) this powertoy is a must!
Double-click the TapiTNA icon or place a shortcut to it in your Start menu.
An icon will appear in your Taskbar notification area (near the clock)
A menu from this icon enables you quick access to:
<PRE>   *) change your current TAPI location
   *) bring up dialing properties
   *) run Phone Dialer

</PRE>*** TweakUI
<P>
TweakUI is the handy Control Panel for "Type A" personalities. With
TweakUI, you can change:
--menu speed
--mouse sensitivity
--window animation and sound
--shortcut appearance and default names
--which icons appear on your desktop
--create new templates
--boot parameters including whether or not to start the graphic user
interface
--and there's more!!!!!
<P>
Please give it a try
<P>
*** FAST FOLDER CONTENTS
<P>
With this handy-dandy context-menu extension, when you right-click on any
folder or other container, you'll get a cascade menu that shows you all the
contents of that folder, one-level deep. It works on shortcuts-to-folders,
too.
<P>
PENDING CHANGES/FIXES: None.
<P>
<P>
*** FLEXI CD
<P>
FlexiCD is a taskbar notification icon that makes controlling audio CDs a
breeze. When an audio CD is in your drive, FlexiCD gives you convenient
single-click play/pause control, a tooltip that tells you which track and
time you're on, and a right-click menu that provides commands for starting,
stopping, ejecting and moving around the tracks on your CD.
<P>
<P>
*** CABFILE VIEWER
<P>
You know those *.CAB files that you'll find on the Win95 CD and floppies?
(These are files containing one or more compressed files.) Well, with the
CABFILE Viewer shell extension, you can browse right into a CAB file and
see all of its contents, and perform normal shell operations on the files
inside.
<P>
*** DESKMENU
Get to the contents of your desktop from a convenient menu without moving a
single window!
This utility appears in your taskbar near the clock and looks like your
desktop icon.  Click it for quick access to all of your desktop contents
via a convenient menu. Deskmenu also allows you to minimize and unminimize
all of your windows.
<P>
<P>
<P>
*** ROUND CLOCK
This version of CLOCK.EXE takes advantage of win95's region windows, so
your analog clock will be round, just like a real clock would. To see it in
action, run Clock, then choose "Analog" and "No Title". (Note.. you just
need to copy this EXE to use the clock. No setup file is provided.)
<P>
<P>
***DOS PROMPT HERE 1.0.
Right-click a folder and start an MS-DOS prompt right here, right away.
TIP:  You can even right-click the tiny icon in the far upper left hand
corner of an open folder.
<P>
<P>
<P>
*** EXPLORE FROM HERE
<P>
This is a simple custom command for all folders and containers that lets
you right-click and choose "Explore from Here" to get an Explorer window
that has the target folder as its root.
<P>
<P>
*** SHORTCUT TARGET MENU
<P>
Finally, you can get the properties for a shortcut's target just by right-
clicking the shortcut. This extension will add to any shortcut's context
menu the complete context menu of its target.
<P>
<P>
*** XMOUSE
<P>
For all of the CS majors in the audience-- make the focus follow the mouse
without clicking, a la X Windows. TIP: To turn it off, use the control
panel.
<P>
<P>
*** QUICKRES
<P>
Here's one we wish was built right in: change DPI and bit depth without
rebooting. QuickRes lives in the notification area-- just single-click
(right OR left) on it to select your new display settings. Does not have an
expiration date, but only runs on Windows 95.
<P>
*** SEND TO X
<P>
Adds the following new commands to your "Send To" menu:
<P>
<PRE>  - Send To Any Folder
  - Send To Clipboard as Contents
  - Send To Clipboard as Name
  - Send To Command Line

</PRE>*** FIND X
<P>
Lets you add your own custom commands to the "Find" menu.  Comes with a few
built-in to get you started.
<P>
<PRE>  - Find On the Internet (requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0)

  - Find In the Knowledge Base -- help yourself to Microsoft's own online
                                  database of troubleshooting tips

  - Find Address (requires Microsoft Exchange)

  - Find Email Message (requires Microsoft Exchange)
