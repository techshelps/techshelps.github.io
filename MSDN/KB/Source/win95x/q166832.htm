The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release versions 2, 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you restart your computer following the installation of the Dial-Up 
Adapter, you may receive the following error messages:

<UL><LI>Cannot find a device file that may be needed to run Windows or a 
   Windows application.

<LI>The Windows registry or SYSTEM.INI file refers to this device, but 
   the device file no longer exists ...

<LI>If you still want to use the application associated with this device 
   file, try reinstalling that application to replace the missing 
   file.
<P>
</UL>The following files are listed as missing:

<UL><LI>Vnetsup.vxd
<LI>Nwlink.vxd
<LI>Nwredir.vxd
<LI>Nscl.vxd
<LI>Vredir.vxd
<LI>Ndis.vxd
<LI>Ndis2sup.vxd
<LI>Vnetbios.vxd
<P>
</UL>Two additional dialog boxes may appear informing you that the following 
two files cannot be found:

<UL><LI>Nwnp32.dll   
<LI>Msnp32.dll
  
</UL>After you acknowledge these error messages, Windows starts normally but 
without Dial-Up Networking functionality.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur if you install Dial-Up Networking or the Dial-Up 
Adapter and then cancel Setup while the Copying Files dialog box is 
displayed. The Dial-Up Networking files are not copied to the hard disk 
but the file names are added to the Windows 95 registry. When the 
computer is restarted, the files are requested and cannot be found.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: If you have previously set up Dial-Up Networking and have added 
items such as phone numbers, TCP/IP settings, and other protocols, 
record the information before you remove the Dial-Up adapter. Do the 
same for Network Adapter properties information if a network adapter is 
listed in Network properties.
<P>
To resolve this problem, remove and then reinstall Dial-Up Networking. 
To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>Click the Windows Setup tab, and then click Communications.

<P><LI>Click Details, and then click the Dial-Up Networking check box to 
   clear it.

<P><LI>Click Close, and then click OK.

<P><LI>When you are prompted to restart Windows 95, do so.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>Click the Windows Setup tab, and then click Communications.

<P><LI>Click Details, and then click the Dial-Up Networking check box to 
   select it.

<P><LI>Click Close, and then click OK.

<P><LI>When you are prompted to restart Windows 95, do so.
<P>
</OL>If any additional protocols are needed, add the protocols using the 
Network tool in Control Panel.
<P>
NOTE: Check with your system administrator or Internet service provider 
to determine the required settings for Dial-Up Networking and TCP/IP.
<P>
For additional information about configuring Dial-Up Networking to work 
with an Internet service provider, see the following article in the 
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you cancel the Dial-Up Adapter installation while the Copying Files 
dialog box is displayed, the installation proceeds and returns the 
following message:

<UL><LI>You must now restart your computer before the new settings will take
   effect. Do you want to restart you computer now?
<P>
</UL>Because the files were not copied to the hard disk, you receive the 
error messages listed at the beginning of this article. Completing the 
installation of the files as outlined above resolves the issue.
