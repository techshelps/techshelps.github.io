<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
2B+D: The Basic Rate Interface (BRI) in ISDN. A single ISDN circuit is
divided into two 64-kbps digital channels for voice or data and one
16-kbps channel for low-speed data and signaling. In ISDN, 2B+D is carried
on one or two pairs of wires. These are the same wire pairs that today
bring only a single voice circuit into your home or office.
<P>
Analog: An electrical circuit that is represented by means of continuous,
variable physical quantities, such as voltages and frequencies, as opposed
to discrete representations, such as an 0/1 or off/on used in digital
circuits.
<P>
B Channel: This is an ISDN communication channel that bears or carries
voice, circuit or packet conversations. The B channel is the fundamental
component of ISDN interfaces. It carries 64,000 bits per second in either
direction.
<P>
BRI (Basic Rate Interface): The most common kind of ISDN interface
available in the United States. BRI contains two B channels, each with
64-kbps capacity, and a single D channel (16-kbps) that is used for
signaling and call progress messages.
<P>
CO (Central Office): A facility that serves local telephone subscribers.
In the CO, subscribers' lines are joined to switching equipment that
allows them to connect to each other for both local and long distance
calls.
<P>
D Channel: This is an ISDN communication channel used for sending
information between the ISDN equipment and the ISDN central office switch.
The D channel can also carry "user" packet data at rates up to 9.6
Kilobits.
<P>
Digital: The use of a binary code to represent information, such as 0/1,
or off/on.
<P>
ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network): ISDN is a completely digital
telephone/telecommunications network that carries voice, data, and video
information over the existing telephone network infrastructure. It is
designed to provide a single interface for hooking up a phone, fax
machine, computer, and so on.
<P>
Jack Type: Different types of jacks (RJ11, RJ45, or RJ48) can be used for
an ISDN line. RJ11 is the most common type in the world and is most often
used for analog phones, modems, and fax machines. RJ48 and RJ45 are
essentially the same, as they both have the same 8-pin configuration. An
RJ11 jack can fit into an RJ45/RJ48 connector, however, an RJ45/RJ48
cannot fit into an RJ11 connector.
<P>
Loop Qualification: This is a test performed by the phone company to make
sure the customer is within the maximum distance of 18,000 feet from the
central office that services that customer.
<P>
LATA (Local Access and Transport Area): A geographic territory used
primarily by local telephone companies to determine charges for intrastate
calls. As a result of the Bell divestiture, switched calls that both begin
and end at points within the LATA (intraLATA) are generally the sole
responsibility of the local telephone company, while calls that cross
outside the LATA (interLATA) are passed on to an Inter Exchange Carrier
(IXC).
<P>
LEC (Local Exchange Carrier): The local phone companies, either a Regional
Bell Operating Company (RBOC) or an independent phone company, that
provide local transmission services.
<P>
Mid-Span Repeater: A device that amplifies the signal coming to or going
from the central office. This device is necessary for ISDN service if you
are outside the 18,000-foot distance requirement from the central office.
<P>
NI1 (National ISDN 1): A specification for a "standard" ISDN phone line.
The goal is for National ISDN 1 to become a set of standards that every
manufacturer can conform to. For example, ISDN phones that conform to the
National ISDN 1 standard will work, regardless of the central office the
customer is connected to. Note that future standards, denoted as NI2 and
NI3, are currently being developed.
<P>
NT-1: The NT-1 (Network Termination 1) is a device that is required to
connect ISDN terminal equipment to an ISDN line. The NT-1 connects to the
two-wire line (twisted-pair copper wiring) that your telephone company has
assigned for your ISDN service. Your ISDN service will not work if the
NT-1's plug is not connected to a working electrical outlet.
<P>
PBX: Private Branch Exchange is a small version of the phone company's
larger central switching office. A PBX is a private telephone switch. It
is connected to groups of lines from one or more central offices and to
all of the telephones at the location served by the PBX.
<P>
POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service): The basic telephone service, standard
single-line telephones, telephone lines, and access to the public-switched
network. There are no added features, such as call waiting or call
forwarding, with POTS.
<P>
RBOC (Regional Bell Operating Company): There are seven regional telephone
companies that were created by the AT&amp;T divestiture: Nynex, Bell Atlantic,
Bell South, Southwestern Bell, US West, Pacific Telesis, and Ameritech.
<P>
SPID (Service Profile Identifier): The ISDN switch needs to have a unique
identification number for each ISDN set to which it sends calls and
signals. For additional information, please see the following articles in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Troubleshooting the ISDN Accelerator Pack

</PRE>S/T Interface: A 4-wire ISDN circuit. The S/T interface is the part of an
ISDN line that connects to the terminal equipment.
<P>
Switched 56: Digital service at 56 Kbps provided by local telephone
companies and long distance carriers. Similar to ISDN, Switched 56 traffic
can travel over the same physical infrastructure that supports ISDN.
Switched 56, however, is an older technology with decreasing significance.
<P>
U Interface: A 2-wire ISDN circuit, essentially today's standard 1-pair
telephone company local loop made of twisted-wire. The U interface is the
most common ISDN interface and extends from the central office.
