The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release version 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you set up OEM Service Release version 2.1 (OSR2.1) over OEM Service
Release 2 (OSR2) and restart your computer, you may receive an error
message stating that the Vmm32.vxd file is missing or damaged, or you may
not be able to boot Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors can occur if either of the following conditions exists:

<UL><LI>The Vmm32.vxd file was not rebuilt properly or was damaged, resulting
   in an error message stating that "Vmm32.vxd is missing or corrupt."

<LI>The addition of Universal Serial Bus (USB) support is causing a
   conflict with the system and Windows 95 is unable to boot normally.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method:
<P>
<P><h3>Vmm32.vxd Missing or Damaged</h3>
 
<P>
If you receive an error message stating that the Vmm32.vxd file is missing
or damaged, the rebuilding of the Vmm32.vxd file was unsuccessful,
preventing Windows from booting properly and processing the RunOnce
section of the registry.
<P>
You must uninstall OSR2.1 using the OSR2.1 real-mode uninstall tool
(Rem.pss) on the installation disk. To use the uninstall tool, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Restart your computer.

<P><LI>Press the F8 key when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, and
   then choose Safe Mode Command Prompt Only from the Startup menu.

<P><LI>Copy the Rem.pss file to the root folder of the boot drive as
   Remusb.bat (do not copy it to Rem.bat; "Rem" is a reserved command
   and it will not function).

<P><LI>Type "remusb" (without quotation marks) to restore the original files
   that were renamed with an .o20 extension.

<P><LI>To complete the uninstall process, restart your computer and use the
   Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel to remove the program
   "WDM/USB Supplement."
<P>
   NOTE: This program may not be listed in the Add/Remove Programs tool.
   If it is not listed, skip this step.

<P><LI>Delete the Remusb.bat file from the root folder of the boot drive.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The Rem.pss file has only been tested when the first reboot does not
succeed. Failure to boot at any other time may not be resolved by the
Rem.pss file process.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95 Cannot Boot Because of a Conflict</h3>
 
<P>
If Windows 95 cannot boot because of a conflict, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Restart your computer.

<P><LI>Press the F8 key when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, and
   then choose Safe Mode from the Startup menu.

<P><LI>Rename the Detroit.bat file to Autoexec.bat. The Detroit.bat file is
   your original Autoexec.bat file that was renamed by OSR2.1 Setup.

<P><LI>Troubleshoot using standard Safe-mode troubleshooting.
<P>
</OL>For information about how to troubleshoot Windows using Safe mode, see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
