   For information about installing Dial-Up Scripting, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Automate Dial-Up Networking Connections

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To determine the DLL file used by Dial-Up Networking, view the Path value
under the following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\RemoteAccess\
   Authentication\SMM_Files\PPP

</PRE>The default value is "Rasapi32.dll." If Dial-Up Scripting is installed,
this value may be "Smmscrpt.dll."
<P>
CompuServe's WOW! software, which is included with Windows 95 OEM Service
Release 2 (OSR2), changes the Path value to "Smmcctb.dll" and adds
"CISPPP: PPP connection using CompuServenetworks" to the available server
types in the Dial-Up Networking connection properties.
<P>
The CompuServe WOW! software should no longer be necessary because
CompuServe discontinued the WOW! service as of January 31, 1997.
<P>
For information about the CompuServe WOW! service, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
