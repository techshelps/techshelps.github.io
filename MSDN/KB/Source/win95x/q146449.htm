<P>
The following components are included with Microsoft Windows 95 Service
Pack 1:
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft 32-Bit DLC Protocol for Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
The Data Link Control (DLC) protocol is used primarily to access IBM
mainframe and IBM AS/400 computers. The 32-bit DLC protocol software for
Windows 95 enables a network administrator to add support for 32-bit and
16-bit DLC programs. Host terminal-emulation programs use this protocol
to communicate directly with mainframe computers. The DLC protocol is not
used for general networking with Windows 95. For additional information
about this component, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

This update provides a version of Microsoft Exchange that supersedes the
version of Microsoft Exchange included with Windows 95. The updated version
provides fixes and enables users running Microsoft Exchange with Windows 95
to access their Microsoft Mail shared folders. (The Microsoft Mail
information service included with Windows 95 does not provide access to
shared folders.) For more information on this update, see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : SFS Post Office Shared Folders Not Available with
               MS Exchange

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 makes browsing the Internet as easy as
using Windows 95, provides speed and functionality, and delivers
compatibility with today's standards while innovating for the future.
<P>
For additional information about this component, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 for Windows 95 Available

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services and the Microsoft
Client for NetWare Networks provide full client support for NetWare
Directory Services.
<P>
If you are a network administrator and your site uses NetWare version
4.0x and 4.1 servers, you should install this service to provide full
Windows 95 networking support to your NetWare client users. For additional
information about this component, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q138709.htm">Q138709</A></B>
   TITLE     : Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services Available

</PRE><h3>Windows 95 Infrared Driver version 1.0</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 Infrared driver enables you to use IrDA devices to connect
to peripheral devices or other Windows 95-based computers without using
cables.
<P>
You should install the Windows 95 Infrared driver if your computer is
equipped with an infrared (IrDA-compatible) device that you want to use
with Windows 95. Windows 95 Service Pack 1 includes the Infrared
Communications Driver version 1.0. Infrared Communications Driver version
2.0 is now available as a separate download. For information on Infrared
Communications Driver version 2.0, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Windows 95 Support for Infrared Data Association
               Connectivity

</PRE><h3>Windows 95 SLIP and Scripting Support for Dial-Up Networking</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) support enables you to use
Dial-Up Networking to connect to any remote access server that uses the
SLIP standard. For more information about SLIP, see the Microsoft Windows
95 Resource Kit.
<P>
Scripting support makes it possible for you to use scripts with Dial-Up
Networking. Many online service providers require you to enter information
such as your user name and password in order to establish a connection.
With Dial-Up Scripting, you can write a script to automate this process.

   TITLE     : CD-ROM Extras for Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Word Viewer</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word Viewer version 7.1 enables you to view and print documents
created with Microsoft Word for Windows, even if you do not have Word for
Windows. When you display a document in Word Viewer, it appears exactly as
it would in Word; when you print a document, it looks just as if you had
printed it from Word. Although you cannot use Word Viewer to edit
documents, you can copy information from Word documents and activate OLE
objects embedded within them. For additional information about this
component, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
