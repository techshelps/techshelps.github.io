<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains questions and answers about Microsoft Exchange
in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. Where can I find more information about installing and using the
<P><PRE>       Microsoft Exchange client in Windows 95?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. For more information about installing and using Microsoft Exchange,
       refer to the following resources:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - See the Exchange.txt file in the Windows folder.

        - Press the F1 key in Microsoft Exchange.

        - See the "Electronic Mail and Microsoft Exchange" topic in the
          Windows 95 Resource Kit Help file (Win95rk.hlp). This Help file
          is in the Admin\Reskit\Helpfile folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. Can Microsoft Mail 3.x clients run in Windows 95?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. Current Microsoft Mail clients are supported in Windows 95.
       However, the Microsoft Exchange client offers a more feature-rich,
       unified user interface that is capable of connecting to a variety
       of additional services.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Will Microsoft Exchange convert my previous mail file to a
<P><PRE>       Microsoft Exchange version?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. Microsoft Exchange asks you whether you want it to copy
       information from your existing mail file (.mmf file) to a Microsoft
       Exchange personal information store (.pst file). This process does
       not alter your .mmf file. Note that Microsoft Exchange cannot
       convert your .mmf file if it is located on the postoffice.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       You can also convert .mmf files later by clicking Import on the
       File menu. You must know the password for the .mmf file to import
       it.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Can I use multiple Microsoft Mail clients at the same time in
<P><PRE>       Windows 95?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Microsoft does not support the use of multiple mail clients
       concurrently. You can run the client for Microsoft Mail 3.x,
       Microsoft Remote Mail, or Microsoft Exchange, but you cannot run
       them at the same time.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       You cannot run multiple mail clients at once because doing so could
       cause file contention problems, database damage on the postoffice,
       and other complications for remote mail users and mail-aware
       programs.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Can I use Microsoft Schedule+ version 1.0 with the Microsoft
<P><PRE>       Exchange client?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. You can continue to use Schedule+ 1.0 with the Microsoft Exchange
       client; however, its functionality is somewhat diminished. For
       example, Schedule+ 1.0 works in standalone mode, but you cannot
       send or receive meeting requests. For more information, see the
       "Using Microsoft Exchange with Schedule+ 1.0" topic in the
       Exchange.txt file in the Windows folder.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Can I continue to use Microsoft Schedule+ version 1.0 if I use the
<P><PRE>       Microsoft Mail 3.x components?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. As long as you do not install the Microsoft Exchange components,
       Schedule+ 1.0 works just as it did in earlier versions of Windows.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Can multiple people use the same Windows 95 workstation, use
<P><PRE>       Microsoft Exchange, and keep their e-mail messages private,
       separate, and secure?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. Windows 95 and the Microsoft Exchange client are designed to
       accommodate multiple users. There are several ways to address this
       need. For example, you can protect your message files with
       passwords and set up Microsoft Exchange for multiple profiles on a
       local computer. However, a server-based setup offers a more
       centralized approach to managing multiple users on a single
       workstation.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       For more information, see the "Deployment Planning Guide" and
       "Installation" sections of the Windows 95 Resource Kit online Help
       file.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Can people who work at multiple workstations store all their e-mail
<P><PRE>       in a single, secure message file?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. There are several ways to do this. For example, you can store
       the password-protected .pst and .pab files in an easily accessible
       location on the network. Your Microsoft Exchange profile must
       specify these files at each workstation you use. Another solution
       is to implement a server-based setup that enables the retrieval of
       a much larger set of desktop and configuration preferences from
       anywhere on the network, and then run this configuration on the
       current workstation.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       For more information, see the "Deployment Planning Guide" and
       "Installation" sections of the Windows 95 Resource Kit online Help
       file.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Can I use shared folders in Microsoft Exchange?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. To view shared folders in Microsoft Exchange, download and
       install the Exupdusa.exe file. For information about obtaining
       this file, please see the following article in the Microsoft
       Knowledge Base:

          TITLE     : SFS Post Office Shared Folders Not Available
                      with MS Exchange

10. Q. Can I spell-check my messages in Microsoft Exchange?

    A. The Microsoft Exchange client in Windows 95 does not include a
       spelling checker. However, Microsoft Exchange can use a spelling
       checker from another 32-bit program. For example, Microsoft
       Exchange can use the spelling checker included with Microsoft
       Office 95.
