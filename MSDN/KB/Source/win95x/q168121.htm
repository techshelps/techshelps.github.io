<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When policies are being enforced with Windows 95, the following queries 
are used to determine the correct policy for the current user:

<OL><P><LI>Does a specific policy exist for the user? If yes, implement the 
   policy; if no, continue to the next query.

<P><LI>Are group policies enabled? If yes, is the current user a member of any
   groups within the policy file? If the user is a member of multiple 
   groups, the first one that is specified in the policy file is 
   implemented. If group policies are not enabled or the user is not a 
   member of a group for which policies are implemented, continue to the 
   next query.

<P><LI>Is there a default user in the policy file? If yes, implement the 
   policy; if no, use the current logon User.dat file.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a user logs on and policies are being enforced, the logon name is set
as the current user when the login script finishes. If the current user 
has a specific policy available, that policy is used. 
<P>
If the user does not have a policy, and group policies are enabled, 
Windows 95 determines whether the user is a member of any of the groups 
specified in the .pol file. If the current user is a member of a group, 
the group policy with the highest priority  is used. Groups can be moved 
up and down in priority in Group Policy Editor.
<P>
If the user is not a member of any group, the default user policy is used.
If there is no default user policy, the existing policy remains in effect.
