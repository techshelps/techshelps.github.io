   TITLE     : Using ISDN Terminal Adapters in Windows 95

</PRE>If you are having difficulty connecting to another computer using the ISDN
Accelerator Pack for Internet Explorer 2.0, perform the following steps to
troubleshoot the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that an ISDN adapter is installed correctly in Windows 95 and
   that it is a supported device by following these steps:
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click Network. On the Configuration tab,
<P><PRE>      verify that your ISDN adapter is in the list of installed network
      components. If your ISDN adapter is not in the list of installed
      components, install it using the manufacturer's instructions.
</PRE><P>
   b. Click your ISDN adapter, and then click Properties.
<P>
   c. On the Resources tab, verify the settings for the adapter (such as
<P><PRE>      IRQ and I/O address settings). These settings should match the
      physical settings on the adapter.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      If you are unable to determine the physical settings on your ISDN
      adapter, contact the manufacturer for assistance.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Install Dial-Up Networking if you have not done so already. For
   information about installing Dial-Up Networking, please consult
   your Windows 95 documentation, or search for "Dial-Up Networking"
   in Windows 95 Help.

<P><LI>Verify that the correct network protocols have been installed and
   configured appropriately. To do so, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click Network.
<P>
   b. Verify that the following components have been installed:
<P>
<P><PRE>       - Client for Microsoft Networks
       - Dial-Up Adapter
       - Your ISDN device
       - NDISwan
       - TCP/IP, IPX, or NetBEUI protocol
</PRE>
<P><LI>Verify that the ISDN adapter driver is not set to transfer data above
   the rate of 64K per second. For example, Digi ISDN adapters may be
   configured to transfer data at rates faster than 64K per second by
   using Digiboard bonding. This is not a supported configuration. If
   your driver is configured to transfer data at rates above 64K, disable
   this feature for testing.
<P>
   For information about disabling Digiboard bonding on Digi ISDN
   adapters, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q148179.htm">Q148179</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Digi ISDN Adapter Stops Working During 128K Connection

   If you do not have a Digi ISDN adapter and your ISDN adapter driver is
   configured to transfer data at rates faster than 64K per second,
   contact the manufacturer of your IDSN adapter for instructions on
   disabling this feature.

</PRE><P><LI>If you need to dial a number for an outside line before making a
   connection, add the number by clicking Dialing Properties in the
   connectoid and filling in the "To access an outside line, dial" box
   with the appropriate number.
<P>
   NOTE: If you have a modem installed, you should add a comma (,) after
   the number you use to access an outside line. If you do not include a
   comma, your modem may not dial correctly. ISDN devices ignore the
   comma.

<P><LI>Verify that the correct service profile identifier (SPID) has been
   entered in the ISDN Accelerator Pack settings. To do so, compare the
   SPID entered in the ISDN Accelerator Pack settings with the SPID
   provided by your telephone company.
<P>
   NOTE: If your telephone company has provided a voice SPID and a data
   SPID, the data SPID should be entered in the Channel 1 field. Some
   telephone companies may require that you enter only one data SPID. If
   the SPIDs are voice and data (which is more common), they can be
   entered in any order.
<P>
   If you do not have your full SPID in writing from your telephone
   company, contact them to verify it.
<P>
   For additional information about checking or changing SPIDs, please see
   the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q149718.htm">Q149718</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Change SPIDs in Windows 95

</PRE><P><LI>After making a connection, verify that the connection to the ISDN line
<P><PRE>    is correct for the interface type of your ISDN adapter (these types
</PRE>   are S/T or U). To verify which type of interface your ISDN adapter
   uses, refer to the adapter's documentation or contact the manufacturer.
<P>
   ISDN adapters using an S/T interface must be connected to an NT1 device
   and then to the ISDN line. If you are connecting to an NT1 device,
   verify that the NT1 device has power and that no error lights are
   active.
<P>
   If the Terminal Error light is on, the card cannot synchronize with
   the telephone digital service. This is usually caused by bad SPIDs, an
   improperly seated ISDN adapter card, or the computer that the adapter
   is installed in not being powered on. To troubleshoot the Terminal
   Error light, verify the SPIDs and then remove and reinsert the ISDN
   adapter.
<P>
   If the Line Error light is on, the line is not functioning correctly.
   Contact your telephone company to verify that your ISDN line is
   working.
<P>
   ISDN adapters using a U interface cannot use an NT1 device and must be
   connected directly to the ISDN interface supplied by the telephone
   company.

<P><LI>If the connection is being dropped or is not established at all, try
   changing the protocols or checking the type of server to which you are
   connecting. For more information about the connection, create a
   Ppplog.txt file by viewing the properties of the Dial-Up Adapter in
   Network properties and clicking Yes in the Record A Log File box on
   the Advanced tab.
<P>
   Also, attempt to connect to more than one ISDN server to rule out a
   server that is not functioning as the cause.

<P><LI>Remove the ISDN adapter and all ISDN files from the computer and then
   reinstall them according to the manufacturer's instructions.
