   TITLE     : How to Enable Dial-Up Networking Server Capabilities

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before you can create a Dial-Up Networking connection to a remote server,
you must know the following information:

<UL><LI>The remote server's phone number.
<LI>The network protocols installed on the remote server.
<LI>The type of remote server you want to connect to [such as Windows for
   Workgroups and Windows NT 3.1; NetWare Connect (NRN); or Windows 95,
   Windows NT Server 3.5, or Internet (PPP)].
<LI>The remote server's computer name.
<P>
</UL><h3>Installing a Modem</h3>
 
<P>
If a modem has not been installed and configured on your computer, you
must install one by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Modems.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions in the Install New Modem Wizard.
<P>
</OL><h3>Installing Dial-Up Networking</h3>
 
<P>
If Dial-Up Networking is not installed on your computer, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>On the Windows Setup tab, click Communications, and then click Details.

<P><LI>Click the Dial-Up Networking check box to select it, and then click
   OK.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions on the screen. When you are prompted to
   restart your computer, do so.
<P>
</OL><h3>Creating a Connection</h3>
 
<P>
To create a Dial-Up Networking connection, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the My Computer icon and then double-click the Dial-Up
   Networking icon.

<P><LI>Double-click Make New Connection.
<P>
   Notes:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If you have not created a connection previously, the Make New
      Connection Wizard starts automatically.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If you have not installed a modem in Windows 95, the Install New
      Modem Wizard appears. Follow the instructions to install a modem.
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the "Type a name for the computer you are dialing" box, type a
   name for the connection. Verify that the correct modem is selected,
   and then click Next.

<P><LI>Type the area code and telephone number for the connection, select the
   appropriate country code for the remote server you are dialing, and
   then click Next.

<P><LI>Click Finish to add an icon for this connection to the Dial-Up
   Networking folder.
<P>
</OL><h3>Configuring the Connection</h3>
 
<P>
To configure the new connection, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the new connection, and then
   click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click Server Type and configure the settings to match the remote
   server.
<P>
   NOTE: It is usually best to leave the Advanced Options settings alone.
   Change these settings only if you are having problems connecting to the
   server.

<P><LI>Select the network protocols in use on the server.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then click OK again.
<P>
</OL><h3>Verifying Network Protocols</h3>
 
<P>
To determine which network protocols are installed on your computer,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>View the protocols listed in the "The following network components
   are installed" box.
<P>
</OL>If you need to install a network protocol, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Network properties, click Add.

<P><LI>Click Protocol, and then click Add.

<P><LI>In the Manufacturers box, click Microsoft. In the Network Protocols
   box, click the protocol you want to install, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Connecting to the Remote Server</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Double-click My Computer, and then double-click Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Double-click the Dial-Up Networking connection you want to use.

<P><LI>Click Connect.
<P>
</OL>When you connect, a window appears stating that you are connected to the
server you specified. This window also shows the speed and duration of the
connection.
<P>
Note that if you use Network Neighborhood to view the network after you
connect, it may take a long time to build a browse list (depending on the
size of the network). Also, you see a browse list only if the server you
connect to is connected to a LAN.
<P>
If the remote server is a Dial-Up Networking server, follow these steps
to view the remote server in Network Neighborhood:
<P>
On the Dial-Up Networking Server:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>Click File And Printer Sharing For Microsoft Networks, and then
   click Properties.

<P><LI>Click Browse Master, and then click Enabled in the Value box. Click
   OK.

<P><LI>On the Identification tab, note the name in the Workgroup box. Click
   OK.

<P><LI>When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.
<P>
</OL>On the Dial-Up Networking Client:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>On the Identification tab, change the name in the Workgroup box
   to match the name you noted in step 4 above. Click OK.
<P>
</OL>When you dial in to the server, you can view the two computers in
Network Neighborhood. Note that it may take a few minutes before you
see the computers in Network Neighborhood.
<P>
<P><h3>Connecting to Shared Resources</h3>
 
<P>
Once you are connected to a remote server, you can map a network drive or
view shared network resources. Note that in order to view a resource, it
must be shared by the host computer (the remote server or another
computer connected via the network to the remove server).
<P>
To view resources, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, and then click Run.

<P><LI>Type the following line in the Open box and then click OK
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\&lt;computername&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;computername&gt; is the name of the computer with resources you
   want to view.
<P>
</OL>To map a network drive, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood, and then
   click Map Network Drive on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>In the Drive box, click the drive letter you want to use for the
   network drive.

<P><LI>In the Path box, type "\\&lt;computername&gt;\&lt;sharename&gt;" (without
   quotation marks), where &lt;computername&gt; is the name of the server
   sharing the resource, and &lt;sharename&gt; is the name of the shared
   resource you want to use.
<P>
</OL>To connect to resources on other networks, consult the documentation for
the network or check with your network administrator.
