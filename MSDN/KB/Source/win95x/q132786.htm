The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience one or more of the following problems with Microsoft
Print Agent for NetWare Networks (MSPSRV):
<P>
<P><h3>Wrong Font Size Used on Print Server Tab in Printer Properties</h3>
 
<P>
When you click the Print Server tab in the Printer Properties dialog box,
the text extends beyond the border of the dialog box. The dialog box is
still usable.
<P>
<P><h3>Error Message: Could Not Enumerate Print Servers on this Server</h3>
 
<P>
When you click "Enable Microsoft Print Server for NetWare," you receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not enumerate print servers on this server.

</PRE>When you receive this error message, you are automatically logged off the
NetWare server and your NetWare connections are lost. You must restart
Windows 95 and log on again to restore your connections.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Activate Print Server List Box</h3>
 
<P>
In order to activate the Print Server list box, you must click the NetWare
Server list box and then click your NetWare server. You must do this even
if the appropriate NetWare server appears in the box.
<P>
<P><h3>Preferred Server Listed Twice in Network Neighborhood</h3>
 
<P>
MSPSRV causes the server on which the print queue resides to appear in
Network Neighborhood. If this is also your preferred server, you may see
it listed in Network Neighborhood twice.
<P>
<P><h3>You are Prompted for Password to NetWare Server</h3>
 
<P>
Each time you access a NetWare server, you are asked for the password.
This occurs even when you are already logged on to the NetWare server.
<P>
<P><h3>Lost Connection to NetWare Server When Printing</h3>
 
<P>
If MSPSRV is enabled and you send multiple print jobs to a NetWare print
server, you lose the connection to the NetWare server.
<P>
<P><h3>Wrong Form Printed</h3>
 
<P>
All print jobs sent to a NetWare server print queue revert to form zero,
even if a different form number or name is used.
<P>
For additional information about this problem, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q148904.htm">Q148904</A></B>
   TITLE     : NetWare Print Jobs Always Use Form Zero

</PRE><h3>Must Restart Computer After Enabling or Disabling MSPSRV</h3>
 
<P>
After you enable or disable MSPSRV, you must restart your computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Not All NetWare Print Servers Enumerated</h3>
 
<P>
A Windows 95-based workstation with MSPSRV enabled may not enumerate all
of the NetWare print servers on the list.
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. An
update to address this problem is now available, but is not fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft does not recommend implementing this update at this
time. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for additional information about
the availability of this update.
