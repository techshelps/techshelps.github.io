<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the features of the Microsoft Client for NetWare
Networks in Windows 95.
<P>
For Windows 95, Microsoft has written a 32-bit NetWare-compatible network
provider and file system driver. These components are installed in the
Windows 95 network architecture for seamless integration into the Windows
95 user interface.
<P>
If real-mode NetWare TSRs or add-on products are not needed, then there is
no need for NetWare real-mode components such as Ipx.com, Ipxodi.com,
Netx.exe, or Vlm.exe. The Windows 95 NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) client and
server supply 32-bit performance that is faster than native NetWare drivers
are and take up no conventional memory.
<P>
The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks provides interoperability for
NetWare 2.2, 3.x, and 4.x servers running bindery emulation. Windows 95
systems can browse NetWare servers, connect to servers, map network drives,
and connect NetWare bindery-based utilities. The Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks executes NetWare login scripts that do not contain TSRs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks has the following key features:

<UL><LI>High performance - The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks performs
   large block file transfers and common network read and write operations
   much faster than Windows 3.1 with the Novell VLM shell.

<LI>Reliability - The client runs in protected mode and is designed for
   operation in a multitasking environment.
<P>
   No conventional memory footprint - By running in protected mode as a
   32-bit VxD, the drivers take no MS-DOS conventional memory space.

<LI>Auto-reconnect - This feature allows the Microsoft Client for NetWare
   Networks to behave similarly to Microsoft network Server Message Block
   (SMB) connections. If a Windows 95-based computer loses its connection
   to an NCP server, the Windows 95-based computer's connection is re-
   established when that NCP server becomes available again. The
   connection status, drive mappings, and printer connections are all
   re-established.

<LI>Packet Burst protocol support - The Microsoft Client for NetWare
   Networks supports burst mode NCPs for faster transfer of NCP
   information.

<LI>Client-side caching - As a Windows 95 file system driver (FSD), the
   Windows 95 NCP redirector uses the same 32-bit cache as all other FSDs
   and can cache network data for faster access.

<LI>Plug and Play-aware - The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks is Plug
   and Play enabled and monitors and responds to Plug and Play events.

<LI>Long filename support - The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks
   supports long filenames on NetWare volumes configured with OS/2 Name
   Space (an HPFS implementation for Novell NetWare server volumes) and on
   Windows 95-based computers configured with the File and Print Sharing
   for NetWare Networks service (NCP server).

<LI>Fully integrated into the Windows 95 user interface - NetWare server
   resources can be accessed using Network Neighborhood, or through any
   drive or printer dialog box.

<LI>Fully interoperable with Novell NetWare 2.2, 3.x, and 4.x servers - The
   Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks can access bindery-based NetWare
   servers. This includes 2.2 and 3.x servers, and 4.x servers configured
   for bindery emulation.

<LI>Graphical logon to NetWare 2.2, 3.x, and 4.x bindery - Logon to Windows
   95 is linked to a NetWare bindery-based server. This logs users on to
   the Windows 95 system and to their preferred NetWare server. In
   addition, a user can be validated for the Windows 95 system by their
   preferred server by making the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks
   the primary logon.

<LI>Supports Large Internetwork Packet (LIP) protocol - NetWare clients and
   servers negotiate packet size when a client attaches to a server.
   Previously, if a server identified a router between itself and the
   client, the packet size was set to 576 bytes. LIP allows the client and
   server to negotiate the packet size used when communication occurs
   through a router. With LIP, the packet size depends on the maximum
   physical packet size common to both the client and the server. LIP is
   enabled between Windows 95-based computers running the Microsoft Client
   for NetWare Networks and either NetWare 3.12 or 4.x servers or Windows
   95 NCP servers.
