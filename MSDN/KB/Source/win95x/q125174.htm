<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Code 1</h3>
 
<P>
This code means the system has not had a chance to configure the device.
<P>
To resolve this error code, use Device Manager to remove the device and
then run the Add New Hardware tool in Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Code 2</h3>
 
<P>
This code means the device loader (DevLoader) failed to load a device.
<P>
To resolve this error code, use Device Manager to remove the device and
then run the Add New Hardware tool in Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Code 3</h3>
 
<P>
This code means the system has run out of memory.
<P>
To resolve this error code, use Device Manager to remove the device and
then run the Add New Hardware tool in Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Code 4</h3>

This code means the .inf file for this device is incorrect. For example,
the .inf file specifies a field that should be text, but is binary
instead.
<P>
To resolve this error code, use Device Manager to remove the device and

receive this error code, please contact the hardware's manufacturer for
an updated .inf file.
<P>
<P><h3>Code 5</h3>

   TITLE     : Troubleshooting Device Conflicts with Device Manager

</PRE></OL><h3>Code 7</h3>
 
<P>
This code means that no configuration can be performed on the device.
<P>
If the device works correctly, you do need not to perform any steps to
correct the code. If the device does not work correctly, use Device Manager
to remove the device and then run the Add New Hardware tool in Control
Panel. If you continue to receive this error code and the device does not
function properly, check with the hardware's manufacturer or the Microsoft
Software Library for an updated driver.
<P>
<P><h3>Code 8</h3>
 
<P>
This code means the device loader (DevLoader) for a device could not be
found. For example, the .inf file for the device may refer to a missing or
invalid file.
<P>
To resolve this error code, use Device Manager to remove the device and
then run the Add New Hardware tool in Control Panel. If you continue to
receive this error code, contact the hardware's manufacturer about an
updated .inf file.
<P>
<P><h3>Code 9</h3>
 
<P>
This code means that the information in the registry for this device is
invalid.
<P>
To resolve this error code, use Device Manager to remove the device and
then run the Add New Hardware tool in Control Panel. If you continue to
receive this error code, contact the hardware's manufacturer for the
proper registry settings.
<P>
<P><h3>Code 10</h3>
 
<P>
This code means that the device failed to start (for example, it is
missing or is not working properly).
<P>
To resolve this error code, make sure the device is attached to the
computer correctly. For example, make sure all cables are plugged in fully
and that all adapter cards are plugged into their slots fully.
<P>
<P><h3>Code 11</h3>
 
<P>
This code means that the device failed.
<P>
To resolve this error code, use Device Manager to remove the device and
then run the Add New Hardware tool in Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Code 12</h3>
 
<P>
This code means one of the resource arbitrators failed. This can occur if
the device is software configurable and it does not currently have a
resource, if the system is out of resources (for example, all the
interrupts are in use), or if the device requests a resource and that
resource is currently in use by another device that will not release the
resource.

failed to inform Windows 95 when it was ready to start the device.
<P>
To resolve this error code, use Device Manager to remove the device and
then run the Add New Hardware tool in Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Code 24</h3>
 
<P>
This code means that the device was not found (for example, it is missing
or is not working properly).

receive this error code, check with the hardware's manufacturer or the
Microsoft Software Library for an updated driver.
<P>
<P><h3>Code 27</h3>
 
<P>
This code means the portion of the registry describing possible resources
for a device does not contain valid entries. For example, the device is
marked as configurable, but the configuration information in the .inf file
is set to hardwired.
<P>

<P><h3>Code 29</h3>
 
<P>
This code means the device has been disabled because the device does not
work properly and cannot be made to work properly with Windows 95.
<P>
You may be able to resolve this error code by enabling or disabling the
device in the computer's CMOS settings. Windows 95 cannot override this
setting. Please contact the computer's manufacturer for assistance with
using the computer's CMOS setup program.
<P>
<P><h3>Code 30</h3>
 
<P>
This code means that an IRQ cannot be shared. This may occur when a
PCI/EISA SCSI controller is sharing an IRQ that is also in use by a real-
mode device driver that Windows 95 does not take over.
<P>
To resolve this error code, remove the real-mode driver that is using the
same IRQ as this device. The real-mode driver may be loading in the
Config.sys or Autoexec.bat file.
