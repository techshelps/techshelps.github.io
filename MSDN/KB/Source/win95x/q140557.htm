The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a copy of the information in a press release
concerning the Windows 95 password list security issue.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Background</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 password list is a password cache. When a user first types
and saves a password while connecting to a password protected resource,
Windows 95 caches the password in the password list file. Logging on with a
Windows 95 password unlocks the list and associates those passwords with
the Windows 95 password. To the user, it seems as if the passwords for
Windows 95 and the password protected resources are the same. If password
caching is disabled, users must type the passwords each time they connect
to a password protected resource.
<P>
Recently, an algorithm was posted on the Internet which can be used to
compromise the security used in the password list file. If someone can
access the .pwl file on the hard disk of a Windows 95 machine, they may be
able to perform operations on the file that can generate the unencrypted
password(s).
<P>
The Windows 95 password file is only vulnerable when access is available
to the .pwl file on the Windows 95 machine's disk.
<P>
Microsoft recommends that customers who are concerned about this issue
disable password caching until an updated component is installed.
<P>
Password caching can be disabled by using the system policy editor (as
described in the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit, page 471) or with the
registry editor by adding the following key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\
   Network\DisablePwdCaching = 1

</PRE>NOTE: The DisablePwdCaching value should be added as a DWord value.
<P>
<P><h3>Replacement Component</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft has released a replacement component (Mspwlupd.exe) that will
ensure that the password list is secure. For additional information about
obtaining the replacement component, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q132807.htm">Q132807</A></B>
   TITLE     : Enhanced Encryption for Windows 95 Password Cache

</PRE><h3>Warnings</h3>
 
<P>
You can edit the registry using System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) or 
Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Check with your network administrator 
before you make any changes to the registry.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may 
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that 
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be 
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) is available in the Admin\Apptools\
Poledit folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. Use the Add/Remove Programs tool
in Control Panel to install System Policy Editor.
<P>
NOTE: System Policy Editor is not included in the floppy disk version of
Windows 95. You can download Policy.exe, a self-extracting executable file
containing Poledit.exe, from online services. Please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for information about downloading
Policy.exe:
