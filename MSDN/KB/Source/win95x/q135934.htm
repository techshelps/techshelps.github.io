<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If Disk Defragmenter is running on one drive and you try to use DriveSpace
3 in protected mode to upgrade another drive from DoubleSpace or Drive-
Space to DriveSpace 3 or to uncompress another drive, you may receive the
following error messages:

<UL><LI>Windows could not start the DEFRAG.EXE program. Copy the program
   file to the C:\ directory and then try again.

<LI>There was not enough free space on drive D to complete this task. Some
   files have not been upgraded to DriveSpace 3 format. These files have
   been copied to drive H. If you want to upgrade these files you must
   delete unwanted files from drive D and then try again.

<LI>Not enough free space to upgrade. Between drive H and its host D at
   least 2.00 MB of physical free space is needed. Try deleting files or
   moving files to other drives to free up space.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Only one instance of Disk Defragmenter can run at a time. If Disk
Defragmenter is running on another drive, DriveSpace 3 cannot start it as
part of the process of upgrading or uncompressing the drive.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Quit Disk Defragmenter before you use DriveSpace 3 to compress, upgrade,
or uncompress a drive.
<P>
When you encounter the error messages listed above, two compressed volume
files (CVFs) may be left on the drive. These are the original CVF and the
new DriveSpace 3 CVF. To complete the upgrade, move the remaining files
from the original CVF to the DriveSpace 3 CVF. This procedure may entail
reducing the size of the original CVF and increasing the size of the
DriveSpace 3 CVF. You may have to do this more than once. Once you move
all the files from the original CVF, delete the original CVF using
DriveSpace.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can upgrade a drive in protected mode if the drive does not contain
Windows 95, does not contain the swap file, and is not referenced in the
System.ini file.
