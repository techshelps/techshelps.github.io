<PRE>      Contents, under "Tips and Tricks."


</PRE><h3>MS-DOS Command Prompt</h3>
 
<P>
[Visual Display of Directory from Command Prompt]
If you are at a command prompt and want a visual display of a
directory (folder), type "start .", or "start .." and an open folder
of that directory appears on the desktop.
<P>
[Drag and Drop Filenames to Command Prompt]
You can drag file and folder icons from the desktop or a folder to an
MS-DOS command prompt. The filename is then in the keyboard buffer
of the running MS-DOS-based application.
<P>
[Copy/Paste Information From/To Command Prompt]
Activate the toolbar in the MS-DOS-based program window to gain point-
and-click access to copy, cut, and paste operations from a Windows-
based program to an MS-DOS-based program. For example, copy a folder
output on the screen, and then paste it into mail.
<P>
[Starting Windows-Based Programs from a Command Prompt]
You can start Windows-based programs from a command prompt by typing
the name of the program you want to run, and then specifying any
parameters as needed. For example, to start Notepad, type "notepad" at
the command prompt, and then press Enter. You can also start Windows-
based programs in batch files.
<P>
You can also use the Start command to start a program or open a
document.
<P>
For example: C:&gt;start Docname.ext).
<P>
[Command.pif]
If you set the properties for an MS-DOS prompt the wrong way, and you
can't open an MS-DOS window, go into the PIF directory and edit
Command.pif, or find Command.com and edit the properties there.
<P>
[DOSKEY]
If you want to use DOSKEY in an MS-DOS window without loading it in
Autoexec.bat or creating a startup batch script, you can go to the
Program properties and enter doskey as the startup batch file. If you
decide later that you want to have a real startup batch file, simply
move DOSKEY into this batch file.
<P>
[Directory Shortcuts]
Related directories have the following shortcuts:
. = current directory
.. = parent directory
... = parent directory once removed directory (new in Windows 95)
.... = parent directory twice removed (new in Windows 95)
For example, if you are in the C:\Windows\System\Viewers directory,
and you enter cd... at the command prompt, the directory changes to
C:\.
<P>
<P>
[Command Line Parameters]
Add a "?" to the command line of MS-DOS programs, and you will be
prompted to add parameters when you start the program. This is
especially useful with MS-DOS program shortcuts.
<P>
<P>
[Easy Disk Copy From the Desktop]
Create a shortcut on the desktop with diskcopy a: a: at the command
prompt to copy a disk (substitute b: to use b: drive).
<P>
<P>
<P>
Cut, Copy, Paste, Drag and Drop
 
<P>
[Drag and Drop]
To move an object, use the left mouse button to drag the object from
one folder to another on the same drive. Use Shift+Left-drag to force
a move.
<P>
To copy an object, use the left mouse button to drag the object from
one folder to another on a different drive. Use CTRL+Left+drag to
force a copy.
<P>
To create a shortcut to an executable, use the left mouse button to
drag an executable file to a new folder.
<P>
Use the right mouse button to drag an object from one folder to
another, and then select 'Create Shortcut(s) Here' to create a
shortcut to that object. The icon annotations indicate what
will happen: a plus sign for copy, an arrow for a shortcut, and no
symbol for a move. Press ESC while you are dragging the object to
cancel the action.
<P>
To create document shortcuts: Right drag a selection from an OLE
document (for example, Word 95) onto the Desktop or folder, and then
select "Create Document Shortcut Here." This document shortcut will
open the original document at the place in the document that the
shortcut originated.
<P>
To create document scraps: Use the left mouse button to drag a
selection from an OLE document (for example, Word 95) onto the desktop
or folder to create a scrap (a scrap is an OLE object that contains
the selection). Drop the scrap onto another document or back onto the
original document to insert or render it (whichever is most
appropriate).
<P>
[Right Drag and Drop]
Right drag and drop works like left drag and drop except that a menu
is displayed when you drop the object. The menu for folders displays
these commands: Move Here, Copy Here, Create Shortcut(s) Here. The
menu for OLE objects includes:  Create Scrap Here, Move Scrap Here,
Create Document Shortcut Here).
<P>
[Drag to the Taskbar]
You can drag objects from one open document to another open document
(one covering the other) by dragging the object to the target's
taskbar, waiting until the target window is displayed, and then
dragging the object onto the target window.
<P>
<P>
<P>
File Operations
 
<P>
[Creating a New File]
Create a new file by using the right mouse button to click the desktop
or folder, point to New, and then click the type of file you want to
create from the list.
<P>
[Create a New Folder While Saving a File]
When using the Save As command to save a file, you can also create a
new folder in which to store the file. Use the right mouse button to
clickthe dialog box list, point to New, and then click Folder. Double-
click the new folder to open it, and then continue the save process.
<P>
[Deleting Files Without Moving them to Recycle Bin]
Select the file or files to be deleted. Use the right mouse button to
clickthe selection, and then hold down the Shift key and click Delete
(or hold down the Shift key when pressing the Delete key if using the
keyboard).
<P>
[Copying and Moving Files]
Use the right mouse button to click the files you want to copy or
move, and then click Copy or Cut. Open the destination location, and
then click the right mouse button and select Paste.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Folders and Windows Explorer</h3>
 
<P>
[Selecting Multiple Files]
Selecting multiple files in large icon view works differently from
list view. To extend a selection, click the first icon, and then hold
down the Shift key while you click the last icon to be selected. To
change an icon from selected to unselected, hold down the CTRL key
while you select the icon.
<P>
[Keyboard Shortcuts]
* Press Win+E to start Windows Explorer by pointing to 'My Computer'
<PRE> (on Microsoft Natural Keyboard).
</PRE>* Press Backspace to display the parent folder.
* To select all files is a folder, press CTRL+A.
* Press F5 to update the contents list.
<P>
[Special Folders]
You can put the contents of Control Panel or other special folders on
your Start menu (or in any folder). Create a folder by clicking New on
the File menu, and then clicking Folder. Then, paste in the
appropriate name  as shown below:
<P>
<PRE>For                Use This Name
</PRE> 
<PRE>Control Panel      Control Panel.{21EC2020-3AEA-1069-A2DD-08002B30309D}
Dial Up Network   Dial Up Net.{992CFFA0-F557-101A-88EC-00DD010CCC48}
Printers           Printers.{2227A280-3AEA-1069-A2DE-08002B30309D}

</PRE>[Windows Explorer Switches]
Windows Explorer switches are useful in creating rooted folders:
<P>
<PRE>     Explorer [/e][,/root,&lt;object&gt;][[,/select],&lt;sub object&gt;]

</PRE>/e
<PRE>   Use Explorer view (scope and results pane view). The default is
   Open view (results in pane view only).

</PRE>/root&lt;object&gt;
<PRE>   Specify the object in the "normal" name space that is
   used as the root (top level) of this Explorer/Folder (i.e., local
   path or UNC name). The default is the Desktop).
</PRE>/Select
<PRE>   The parent folder opens and the specified object is selected.
   &lt;sub object&gt;   Specify the folder unless /select is used. The
   default is the root.

</PRE>Examples:Explorer /e, /root, \\Reports
<P>
<PRE>         opens an Explorer window at \\Reports.

         Explorer /select, C:\Windows\Calc.exe

         opens a folder at C:\Windows (or activates one that is
         currently open) and selects Calc.exe.


         Explorer/e,/root,\\Source\Internal\Design\Users\David\Archive

         opens a folder to the Archive folder above. This is a good
         way to create a dedicated, remote, documents archive
         folder. A link to this folder (\\Source\Internal\Design\
         Users\David\Archive) can then be placed in the SendTo folder
         for quick routing of documents.



</PRE>Hardware Profiles
 
<P>
Hardware Profiles are used to set up multiple hardware configurations.
This is especially useful for laptops that have docking stations or
workstations with removable storage media.
<P>
The following example demonstrates how to set up hardware profiles for
a laptop with a docking station that has this configuration:
<P>
<PRE>Configuration      Docked         Undocked
