Support
 
<P>
Much information about The Microsoft Network (MSN) is available
online.
You can find answers to many of your questions in the Frequently Asked
Questions and MSN Questions and Answers documents. You can find these
documents by clicking Member Assistance and then double-clicking the
MSN Support folder for your area. If you are unable to find the answer
you need, you can post a question in one of the MSN support bulletin
boards in this same area, and someone from Microsoft product support
will assist you.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Modem Information</h2>
 
<P>
- Make sure to change MSN modem properties by double-clicking the MSN
<PRE>  icon on your desktop, clicking Settings, and then clicking Modem
  Settings.
  Do not use the Modems Control Panel to change modem settings for
  MSN, since MSN overrides some Control Panel modem settings.

</PRE>- If the modem installation wizard selected a "Standard Modem" driver,
<PRE>  this means it could not determine what kind of modem you have. If
  this happens, and if you are having trouble connecting or experience
  dropped connections, and your modem is Hayes-compatible, remove the
  Standard Modem driver and choose a Hayes Compatible modem driver. On
  the Start menu, point to Settings, click Control Panel, double-click
  the Modems icon, select the Standard Modem, and then click Remove.
  Then click Add, and check Don't Detect My Modem, and click Next.
  Under Manufacturers, select Hayes, and choose the "Hayes Compatible"
  model. If you still are having problems, contact Customer Service
  (see next section).


</PRE><h2>If You Have Trouble Connecting to MSN or Finding Online Support</h2>
 
<P>
Try using the Signup and Access Troubleshooter. Use your right mouse
button to click The Microsoft Network icon on your desktop, and then
click Connection Settings. Click Help.
<P>
If you have trouble connecting while trying to sign up for a member
ID, you may be in an area that is not supported by the Microsoft toll-
free signup number. If this happens, your modem will try to connect
several times without success. When the Connection Settings dialog box
appears, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Access Numbers and then for both the primary and backup phone
   numbers, click Change, and choose a number in your calling area.

<P><LI>Click Try Again in the Connection Settings dialog box, and then try
   to connect again.
<P>
</OL>If you are still unable to connect, contact Microsoft Customer
Service. You can look up the Customer Service phone number for your
country in the Signup and Access Troubleshooter (see above
instructions) or by using your right mouse button to click The
Microsoft Network icon on your desktop. Click Properties, and then
scroll through the text.
<P>
If you can't reach Customer Service by using the number listed for
your country, try the number listed in "Other countries" for your
region.

<P><h2>Running The Microsoft Network From a Server</h2>
 
<P>
If you connect to another computer, you cannot run The Microsoft
Network from it. You can run it only from your computer.
