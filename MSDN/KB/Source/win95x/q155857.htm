The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 provides seamless access to network services and resources
using the Multiple Provider Router. This article describes the Multiple
Provider Router.
<P>
MORE INFORMATION
 
<P>
The Multiple Provider Router (MPR) routes incoming network requests to the
appropriate network provider. It uses the same interface whether one or
multiple network providers is installed. It also allows for unlimited
protected-mode network providers as well as one 16-bit network provider.
<P>
When multiple network providers are installed, MPR passes the call to
each installed network provider one at a time, in a defined order. The
installed network providers are sorted by this defined order when they
are loaded. Providers with lower values are called before those with
higher values. Once a network provider returns a successful resolution
of a call, additional network providers are not tried.
<P>
The only method to change the order in which installed network providers
are called is to modify the Windows 95 registry.
<P>
NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing
Keys And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note
that you should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and
User.dat) before you edit the registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee
that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
Network provider information is stored in the following registry branch:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services

</PRE>Under the Services branch, there is a CallOrder key for each installed
network provider. The default CallOrder value for the Novell NetWare
network provider is 00 00 00 20; the default value for the Microsoft
network provider is 00 00 00 40. In this scenario, the NetWare network
provider is called before the Microsoft network provider because of its
lower CallOrder value. The selection of the primary client does not affect
these settings.
<P>
Mpr.dll uses two other components, Mprserv.dll and Mprexe.exe, to
facilitate faster loading of network providers and routing of network
requests. Programs link to Mpr.dll (the smaller component), which copies
API parameters to shared memory and signals a thread in Mprexe.exe to do
the work. Mprserv.dll has the code to load net providers, route requests,
and so on.
