<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to create a Dial-Up Networking connectoid that
uses your existing CompuServe account to establish a Point-to-Point
Protocol (PPP) Internet connection. After you use this Dial-Up Networking
connectoid to connect to the Internet, you can use Microsoft Internet
Explorer or another Internet browser to access the Internet.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create a Dial-Up Networking connectoid that uses your existing
CompuServe account to establish a PPP Internet connection, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>If you have already created a Dial-Up Networking connectoid that you
    want to use to connect to the Internet using your existing CompuServe
    account, you can proceed to step 2. If you have not created a Dial-Up
    Networking connectoid that you want to use for this purpose, use the
    following steps to create a new Dial-Up Networking connectoid:
<P>
    a. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories,
       and then click Dial-Up Networking.
<P>
    b. Double-click the Make New Connection icon.
<P>
    c. Type a name for the new connectoid in the "Type a name for the
       computer you are dialing" box, select the modem that you want to
       use in the Select A Modem box, and then click Next.
<P>
    d. Type the area code and phone number that you normally use to
       connect to CompuServe in the Area Code and Telephone Number boxes,
       select the appropriate country code in the Country Code box, click
       Next, and then click Finish.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and
    then click Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the connectoid that you want to use
    to connect to the Internet using your existing CompuServe account, and
    then click Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click Configure.

<P><LI>Click the Options tab, and then verify that the Bring Up Terminal
    Window Before Dialing and Bring Up Terminal Window After Dialing check
    boxes are not selected.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then click Server Type.

<P><LI>Verify that "PPP: Windows 95, Windows NT 3.5, Internet" is selected in
    the Type Of Dial-Up Server box.

<P><LI>Click the Log On To Network check box to clear it, and then verify that
    the Require Encrypted Password check box is not selected.

<P><LI>Click the NetBEUI and IPX/SPX-Compatible check boxes to clear them, and
    then verify that the TCP/IP check box is selected (the TCP/IP check box
    should be the only check box in the Allowed Network Protocols box that
    is selected).

<P><LI>Click the TCP/IP Settings button, click the Specify Name Server
    Addresses box to select it, and then enter the DNS server settings
    provided by CompuServe in the Primary DNS and Secondary DNS boxes.

<P><LI>If the Dial-Up Scripting Tool is not currently installed on your
    computer, install it by following these steps:
<P>
    a. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel.
<P>
    b. Click the Windows Setup tab.
<P>
    c. Click the Have Disk button, type the path to the Rnaplus.inf file in
       the Copy Manufacturer's Files From box, and then click OK. The
       Rnaplus.inf file is located in the Admin\Apptools\Dscript folder on
       the Windows 95 CD-ROM.
<P>
       NOTE: The Dial-Up Scripting Tool is included in the CD-ROM version
       of Windows 95, but not in the floppy disk version. If you are using
       the floppy disk version of Windows 95 and wish to use the Dial-Up
       Scripting Tool, please see the following article in the Microsoft
       Knowledge Base for information on the availability of the Dial-Up
       Scripting Tool:

       select it, and then click Install.

</PRE><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and
    then click Dial-Up Scripting Tool.

<P><LI>Type the full path (including the file name) to the Cis.scp file in
    the File Name box, and then click OK. The Cis.scp file is located in
    the Program Files\Accessories folder.
<P>
</OL>To establish a PPP Internet connection using your existing CompuServe
account, double-click the connectoid that you created in step 1 or double-
click the connectoid that you had already created to use for this purpose,
type your CompuServe user ID and password in the User Name and Password
boxes, and then click Connect.
<P>
NOTE: You do not need to click Continue or enter any other data while the
Cis.scp script is running. It may take 30 seconds or longer to completely
establish the connection.
