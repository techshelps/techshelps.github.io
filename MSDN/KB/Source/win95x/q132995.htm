<P>
<P><h3>Running an Application in MS-DOS Mode</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 usually runs programs that require MS-DOS mode in MS-DOS mode
automatically. If it does not, delete the corresponding .PIF file and
double-click the program icon again. Note that .PIF files usually have the
same name as the program file, but with a .PIF extension instead of the
.BAT, .COM, or .EXE extension. The corresponding .PIF file can be found in
one of the following locations:

<UL><LI>In the folder that contains the program file.

<LI>In the hidden PIF folder in the Windows 95 folder.

<LI>In a folder specified by your PATH statement.
<P>
</UL>To make certain you find all copies of the .PIF file, use the Find Files
Or Folders feature.
<P>
If Windows 95 does not configure the program to run in MS-DOS mode
automatically, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the executable file with the right mouse button, then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>On the Program tab, click the Advanced button.

<P><LI>Click the MS-DOS Mode check box to select it.

<P><LI>You can usually use the Use Current MS-DOS Configuration option.
   However, some programs may require that you use the Specify A New
   Configuration option. Consult the program's documentation for sample
   CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>These steps cause the program to run in MS-DOS mode. You may need to
optimize the settings if the program requires a mouse, expanded memory, a
CD-ROM drive, or a sound card. Consult the program's documentation to
determine if it has specific needs.
<P>
NOTE: You may have to double-click the program icon in Windows Explorer or
My Computer, or type the program name in the Run dialog box, for the
program's settings to take effect. Typing the program name at an MS-DOS
prompt does not always cause the program's settings to be used.
