<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A file or folder that you created using all uppercase letters is not
displayed with all uppercase letters in Windows Explorer, on the desktop,
or in Windows-based programs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
For readability purposes, Windows displays the names of files and
folders with only the first letter capitalized.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this behavior, use either of the following methods:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
To create a file name that will be displayed in all uppercase letters,
include an extended character (such as a comma or space) in the filename.
This creates a file name that does not adhere to the 8.3 standard, and
causes Windows to preserve the capitalization of the filename as you
typed it.
<P>
For example, if you create a file called FILENAME.EXT, the file name
is displayed as Filename.ext. However, if you create a file called
FILENAM,.EXT, the file name is displayed as FILENAM,.EXT. The comma in
the file name causes the file name to be read as a long filename.
<P>
If you create a file name using mixed uppercase and lowercase letters, the
case of the individual letters is preserved. For example, FileName.Ext is
displayed as you created it.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Install Internet Explorer 4.0 for Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 95, and
   enable the Windows Desktop Update. For information about how to obtain
   Internet Explorer 4.0, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

</PRE><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Folders &amp; Icons.

<P><LI>Click the View tab.

<P><LI>Under Files And Folders, click the Allow All Uppercase Names check
   box to select it, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The MS-DOS 8.3 file name standard describes file and folder names that
contain a maximum of eight characters and an optional extension with a
maximum of three characters. The MS-DOS 8.3 file name standard does not
allow extended characters (such as commas or spaces). In Windows, long
file names can include up to 250 characters, and can include extended
characters such as commas or spaces.
<P>
MS-DOS, by default, converts all the characters in file names and
directory names to uppercase characters. Because Windows cannot determine
whether a file or folder was created with a previous operating system or
was intentionally created with all uppercase characters, it was decided
for readability purposes to have Windows display all 8.3 file names with
only the first letter capitalized.
<P>
For example, if you create a file called FILENAME.EXT in MS-DOS, the file
name appears in MS-DOS and Windows 3.x as FILENAME.EXT. In Windows 95 and
Windows NT, the same file appears as Filename.ext in Windows Explorer, on
the desktop, and in Windows-based programs.
<P>
Note that when you view files in a Windows 95 or Windows NT MS-DOS
session, you see two file names for each file. The first file name is
an 8.3 alias and the second file name is the long file name.
