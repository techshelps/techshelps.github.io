<P><h2>ROAD MAP FOR INSTALLING AND USING THE IR COMMUNICATIONS DRIVER</h2>
 
<P>
You must carry out a three-step process to use the IR communications
driver:
<P>

<OL><P><LI>Install the Windows 95 IR Communications driver.

<P><LI>Validate the installation by using an application to transfer data over
   the IR link.

<P><LI>Start running other communicating applications over the IR link.
<P>
</OL>After you install the driver, you can remove it at any time by
running the Windows 95 Control Panel Add/Remove Programs feature.
<P>
Each of these steps, including the driver removal step, is presented
in detail below.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1. Installing the IR Communications Driver</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: You must always remove any previously installed version of the IR
<PRE>      communications driver every time you install the driver. For
      example, if you have an earlier (Beta) version of the IR
      communications driver already installed you must remove it before
      you install Version 1.0. You may also need to remove an installation
      of the Version 1.0 driver. For example, if you change the IR adapter
      model that is connected to your computer, you must remove the
      installed IR communications driver and reinstall it, specifying the
      new IR adapter type. Instructions for removing the IR communications
      driver are in "An Optional Step: Removing the IR Communications
      Driver."

</PRE></OL>To install the IR communications driver, do the following:
<P>
a. Click the Start button and select the Run option.
<P>
b. In the Run dialog, open the Setup program (SETUP.EXE) from the Infrared
<PRE>   setup location. After the Setup program copies some files, it starts
   the Add Infrared Device Wizard.

</PRE>c. When the wizard prompts you to choose a manufacturer's name for your IR
<PRE>   device, choose "(Standard Infrared Devices)" if you have a computer
   with a built-in device, or choose the name of the manufacturer and the
   model of the adapter if you have an IR adapter attached to the computer.

</PRE>d. When the wizard prompts you to choose the communications port that the
<PRE>   IR device is physically connected to, click the port from the list. If
   you are not certain which physical communications port the IR device is
   using, make your best guess.

</PRE>e. When you are done with the wizard, click the Finish button to complete
<PRE>   the IR device installation. The wizard should have briefly displayed
   New Hardware Found messages. If the wizard did not display these
   messages, then restart the computer.

</PRE>f. Activate the IR device by clicking the Start button, pointing to
<PRE>   Settings, and then clicking Control Panel. Double-click the Infrared
   icon.

</PRE>g. If you chose the correct port in Step d., the Infrared Monitor interface
<PRE>   screen appears. If you did not choose the correct port, a message
   appears telling you that the port you have chosen is being used by
   another program. Click OK. When the Infrared Monitor interface appears,
   click the Options tab, and then choose a different communications port
   (for example, COM1 instead of COM2). Repeat this step until you have
   chosen the correct port.

</PRE>For general information about how to use the Infrared Monitor, click
the Help button in the lower-right corner of the Infrared Monitor
interface screen. To get information about individual items in the
Infrared Monitor interface, such as check boxes, click the
question-mark (?) button in the upper-right corner of the screen and
then click the item you want information about.
<P>
The Options tab of the Infrared Monitor interface contains the
following two particularly useful items:

<UL><LI>The Enable Infrared Communication On check box, which enables and
   disables the IR device.

<LI>The Limit Connection Speed To option, which limits the link speed the
   IR device can negotiate.
<P>
</UL>You might want to use the Limit Connection Speed To option if an
adapter is attached to a COM port that is using an 8250 UART instead
of a 16550 UART, or if an adapter is connected to a relatively slow
computer (such as a 386 running at 20 MHz). In these cases, you could
use this option to limit the connection speed to 19.2 Kbps.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2. Validating the IR Communications Driver Installation</h3>
 
<P>
To validate your IR communications driver installation, you can either:

<UL><LI>Print from an application over an IR link to an IR-capable printer.

<LI>Exchange data between two IR-capable computers over an IR link, using a
   communications application.
<P>
</UL>Printing to an IR-Capable Printer:
<P>
If you are testing the printing capability of a Windows 95
application over an IR link to an IrDA-compliant printer such as the
HP 5P, then you need to carry out the installation step for the IR
communications driver on one computer and then try the Print option
in an application. Make sure you have the correct printer driver
installed for your IR-capable printer and that you have selected the
infrared printing port (virtual LPT port) as the printer port. If the
application prints on the IR-capable printer, you have validated the
link.
<P>
If you have trouble printing, see "Troubleshooting" for more information.
<P>
Exchanging Data Between Two Computers:
<P>
To validate a link between two computers running Windows 95, you must
install the IR communications driver on both computers. To do this,
carry out the procedure in "Step 1. Installing the IR Communications
Driver" earlier in this document.
<P>
Note that the IR devices on the two computers do not have to be made
by the same manufacturer as long as both devices are IrDA-compliant.
For example, you could have a JetEye PC Infrared PC Interface
(ESI-9680) attached to one desktop computer and an Adaptec AIRport
APA-9320 External Infrared Adapter attached to the other desktop and
the IR link will work.
<P>
One way to validate an IR link is to run the HyperTerminal
application on both computers and send characters from the keyboard
of each computer over the IR link. HyperTerminal is installed on a
Windows 95 computer as part of the typical installation that is
recommended for most computers. To validate your installation of the
IR driver on both computers, carry out the following procedure:
<P>
a. On both computers, click the Start button, point to Settings, and then
<PRE>   click the Control Panel. Double-click the Infrared icon. Then move the
   IR devices within 3 feet of each other, and make sure they're pointing
   at each other. When the two IR devices discover each other, the message
   "Available infrared devices in range" will appear on the Status tab of
   the Infrared Monitor interface screen. Make sure Infrared Monitor
   reports both IR devices have the appropriate infrared device within
   range before you proceed. You might have to realign the IR devices so
   they point right at each other, move them closer together, and/or
   change the batteries in an IR adapter or plug the AC power into an IR
   adapter. For more information, see "Troubleshooting" earlier in the
   document.

</PRE>b. On one of the computers, click the Options tab in the Infrared Monitor
<PRE>   interface and find the information that starts with "Providing
   application support on ...". Write down the name of the COM port you
   find there. This is the name of the simulated serial port that the IR
   link using. The name of this virtual serial port might be COM4 or COM5
   and it will differ from the name of the physical communications port
   your IR device is running on (which is typically named COM1 or COM2).

</PRE>c. Run HyperTerminal on the computer for which you have the virtual serial
<PRE>   port name by clicking the Start button, pointing to Programs, pointing
   to Accessories, and then clicking the HyperTerminal folder. In the
   window that appears, double-click the Hypertrm.exe icon.

</PRE>d. In the Connection Description dialog box, type a descriptive name (such
<PRE>   as "Direct IR") for the new connection, and then click OK.

</PRE>e. In the Phone Number dialog box, use the Connect Using drop-down list to
<PRE>   click the "Direct to Comx" entry, where x is the number of the virtual
   COM port that you wrote down in Step b. Then click OK. You are ready to
   start using HyperTerminal on one of the computers.

</PRE>f. Repeat steps b. through e. for the other computer.
<P>
g. In HyperTerminal on either computer, type any characters at the
<PRE>   keyboard. If the characters you type appear in the HyperTerminal window
   on the other computer, then you have confirmed that the IR link works
   in that direction. Repeat this step on the other computer. If the IR
   link works in both directions using HyperTerminal, you have confirmed
   the successful installation of the IR communications driver on the two
   computers.

   Note the changes in status that are displayed in the Status tab of the
   Infrared Monitor interface while you type characters in HyperTerminal.

</PRE>h. Disconnect the HyperTerminal direct IR connection by exiting the
<PRE>   HyperTerminal application on both computers. When you are prompted to
   save the session, click Yes. This saves the direct IR connection setup
   information as an icon in the HyperTerminal main folder. You can
   double-click this icon to restart one side of the HyperTerminal direct
   IR connection.

</PRE><h3>Step 3. Running Other IR-Capable Applications</h3>
 
<P>
Most applications that can communicate over a null modem cable that
is connecting serial ports on two Windows 95 computers should also be
able to communicate over an IR link. The procedure for setting up and
using the IR link in these other communicating applications will
probably be similar to the procedure you use in Step 2 of the
Roadmap, when you use the HyperTerminal application to validate the
installation of the IR communications driver.
<P>
<P><h3>An Optional Step: Removing the IR Communications Driver</h3>
 
<P>
To remove the IR communications driver, including all the files and
registry entries, carry out the following procedure:
<P>
a. Make sure the Infrared Monitor (Irmon.exe) is not running. If it is
<PRE>   running, you must restart the computer, or you can close the Infrared
   Monitor dialog box, press CTRL+ALT+DEL, click Irmon, and then click End
   Task.

</PRE>b. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click the Control
<PRE>   Panel.

</PRE>c. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon, and then click the
<PRE>   Install/Uninstall tab.

</PRE>d. In the list of installed software, click the name of the IR
<PRE>   communications entry, and then click the Add/Remove button. For this
   release of the IR communications driver, the entry in the software list
   to click is "Infrared Support for Windows 95 Version 1.0."

</PRE>e. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes. The Infrared
<PRE>   icon will no longer appear in the Control Panel folder

</PRE><h3>Notes on Running the Direct Cable Connection Application Over an IR Link</h3>
 
<P>
With Direct Cable Connection (DCC), you can establish a direct serial
or parallel cable connection between two computers to share the
resources of the computer designated as the host. DCC can also be
used over an IR link.
<P>
Preparing to Use DCC:
<P>
The computer that contains the folder you want to share is the host,
and the other computer is the guest. Share a folder on the host,
granting access rights to anyone using the guest computer, by
carrying out the procedure given below.
<P>
NOTE: The following procedure is just one of many that could be used to
<PRE>      share files in a folder on the host computer. For example, there is
      user-level access control as well as share-level access control. The
      following procedure is one of the simplest access control
      procedures, which is all that is needed to get you started using
      DCC. To get information about all the ways files, folders, and
      printers can be shared, use the Windows 95 Help.

</PRE>a. Double-click on the My Computer icon.
<P>
b. Double-click on the icon of the drive that contains the folder you want
<PRE>   to share (for example, double-click on the icon for the C: drive).

</PRE>c. Right-click on the icon of the folder you want to share and then select
<PRE>   Properties.

</PRE>d. In the folder properties dialog, select the Sharing tab and then select
<PRE>   the Shared As option, enter a share name, enter a comment, and add user
   access rights (Full or Read-Only).

</PRE>e. The picture of a hand is added to the folder icon to indicate the
<PRE>   selected folder is now a shared resource.

</PRE>Making Sure DCC Is Installed on Both Computers:
<P>
DCC is not installed with the typical Windows 95 installation
recommended for most computers. So you must check whether DCC is
installed on both of the two computers that will be using the IR
link. To do this, click the Start button, point to Programs, and then
point to Accessories. Direct Cable Connection appears in this menu of
it is installed on this computer.
<P>
If you find that DCC is installed on the host and DCC is installed on
the guest, you can skip the next step.
<P>
(Optional) Installing DCC:
<P>
Before you can establish a DCC connection, DCC must be installed on
both the host and guest. The procedure for installing DCC is given
below. If you found that DCC is not installed on either the host or
the guest, you must run the following procedure twice (once on each
machine).
<P>
a. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click the Control
<PRE>   Panel. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

</PRE>b. In the Add/Remove Program Properties, click the Windows Setup tab.
<P>
c. In the Components list, click Communications, and then click the
<PRE>   Details button.

</PRE>d. In the Communications dialog box, make sure Direct Cable Connection is
<PRE>   checked and then click OK.

</PRE>Establishing and Using the DCC IR Link Between Host and Guest:
<P>
To run DCC over an IR link, carry out the following procedure:
<P>
a. Make sure the IR communications driver is properly installed and the IR
<PRE>   devices are enabled by carrying out the procedures in "Step 1.
   Installing the IR Communications Driver" and "Step 2. Validating the IR
   Communications Driver Installation" earlier in this document.

   NOTE: You might want to limit the IR connection speed to 9600 bps for
         the first test of DCC over the IR link (and then increase the
         speed later).

</PRE>b. On the host computer, click the Start button, point to Accessories, and
<PRE>   then click Direct Cable Connection.

</PRE>c. Follow the steps in the Direct Cable Connection Wizard to set up the
<PRE>   host computer. When the wizard prompts you, select the Host option.
   When the wizard prompts you to choose a port, use the same virtual port
   as you used in the procedure "Step 2. Validating the IR Communications
   Driver Installation" earlier in this document. The wizard will also
   offer password protection. You do not need to establish password
   protection on the host for this test of the IR link. When you are done
   with the wizard, click the Finish button. DCC will start running on the
   IR link and display the message "Status: Waiting to connect via Serial
   cable on Comx," where Comx is the name of the virtual port the IR link
   is using.

</PRE>d. Repeat steps b. and c. for the guest computer, except when the wizard
<PRE>   prompts you select the Guest option instead of the Host option. When
   you are done with the wizard, click the Finish button. The DCC
   connection is automatically made over the IR link, and all the shared
   folders on the host are displayed on the guest's screen.

</PRE>e. Working on the guest computer, to copy a shared folder from the host to
<PRE>   the guest over the IR link select the folder's icon in the window that
   displays all the shared folders that are on the host and drag the icon
   to the desktop. To work on a shared folder on the host without copying
   it to the guest, double-click on the folder in the display on the
   guest. Note that if the host is connected to a network, the guest can
   reach shared resources on the network through the DCC connection to the
   host.
