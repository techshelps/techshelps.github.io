<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to use File Filtering in Microsoft Backup to exclude all file
types except a certain type, additional files that you did not intend to
include are selected for backing up.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the File Filtering option in Microsoft Backup to exclude only
registered file types. All non-registered files in a selected drive or
folder will be selected for backing up, regardless of whether you use the
File Filtering option.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To include only a particular group of files in a drive or folder for
backing up, use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Manually select the files you want to back up by clicking the icon for
   the drive or folder containing the files and then clicking the files
   in the right side of the window.

<LI>Register all non-registered file types in the drive or folder that
   contains the files you want to back up. Or, remove all the non-
   registered files in the drive or folder. Then, use File Filtering
   to exclude the file types you do not want to back up.

<LI>Store the files you want to back up in a new folder and then select
   the entire folder for backing up.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Registered file types are associated with a particular application. Once
you register a file type you can specify which application should be used
to open, print, or perform some other action on files of that type. You
can specify a different application for each action, or use the same
application for all actions.
<P>
For example, files with a .TXT extension are registered under the file type
Text Document. Text Document files are typically associated with the
Notepad application, so that application is used by default to open or
print files of that type.
<P>
Because the Text Document file type is registered in this manner, you can
open a .TXT file in Notepad by double-clicking it, or print the file by
dragging it to a printer and dropping it. You can also exclude .TXT files
from being backed up because they are registered properly.
