<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When System Agent runs one of the disk tools (Compression Agent, Disk
Defragmenter, or ScanDisk), the tool may pause for user input. Typically,
the tool is prompting for the drive on which it should run, or is waiting
for you to click the Start button.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if the System Agent-aware registry settings for the
disk tool are missing or damaged. If the disk tool does not have valid
registry settings, System Agent does not start the disk tool in unattended
operation mode.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use Registry Editor to verify that the correct registry settings exist for
the disk tool. The System Agent-aware registry settings are located in the
following registry branch:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Plus!\System Agent\SAGE

</PRE>Each disk tool has a key beneath this branch. The keys for the disk tools
are:

<UL><LI>Compression Agent
<LI>Disk Defragmenter
<LI>Low disk space notification
<LI>ScanDisk for Windows
<P>
</UL>The following tables list the default values under these keys. These
settings are required to make the tools function in unattended operation
mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Compression Agent</h3>

</PRE>For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
NOTE: You can also restore these settings by reinstalling System Agent. For
information about reinstalling System Agent without losing your current
System Agent settings, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In addition to the settings listed above, each key contains a Result Codes
subkey. The Result Codes subkey is not required to make a tool System Agent-
aware, but without these settings the Last Result column in System Agent
and the System Agent log file contains only code numbers. The following
tables list the result code settings for each disk tool. All of these
settings are String Values.
