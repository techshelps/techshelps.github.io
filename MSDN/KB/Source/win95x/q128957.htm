The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows Setup tab in the Add/Remove Programs tool may show that a
component is installed, even though the component is not available to the
current user.
<P>
For example, the The Microsoft Network check box may be selected in the
Add/Remove Programs tool even though The Microsoft Network is not
available to the current user.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When user profiles are enabled and neither "Include desktop icons and
Network Neighborhood contents in user settings" nor "Include Start menu
and Program groups in user settings" is selected, components are available
only to the user who was logged on when the component was installed.
<P>
However, once a component has been installed by one user, the component
shows as being installed on the Windows Setup tab regardless of which
user is logged on.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To make a Windows 95 component that was installed by another user
available to the current user, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click My Computer.

<P><LI>Double-click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

<P><LI>On the Windows Setup tab, click the component's check box to clear it.

<P><LI>Click the Apply button. If you are prompted to restart the computer,
   click Yes. After the computer restarts, repeat steps 1-3 to return
   to the Add/Remove Programs Properties window if necessary.

<P><LI>Click the component's check box to select it.

<P><LI>Click the Apply button. If you are prompted to restart your computer,
   click Yes.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs with Windows 95 components that do not have Control
Panel extensions. When these components are installed, Windows 95 updates
the Start menu and registry only for the current user profile. When a
different user logs on, the registry entries and Start menu shortcuts do
not exist and the components are not available.
<P>
The status of components on the Windows Setup tab is not user-specific,
however, so components are reported as installed no matter which user is
logged on.
