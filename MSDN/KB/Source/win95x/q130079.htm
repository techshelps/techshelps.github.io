The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Dial-Up Networking client included with Windows 95
to connect to a Windows 95 or Windows NT remote access server, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Dial-Up Networking could not negotiate a compatible set of network
   protocols you specified in the Server Type settings. Check your
   network configuration in the Control Panel then try the connection
   again.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message can be caused by any of the following situations:

<UL><LI>The network protocols used by the server do not match the protocols
   used by the Dial-Up Networking client.

<LI>The protocol used by the Dial-Up Networking client is not available.

<LI>The line protocols may not match.

<LI>You may be using a PAP or CHAP login and a clear-text terminal login is
   needed. PAP and CHAP authentication uses the user name and password you
   type in the Connect To dialog box when you dial. A terminal login
   occurs after modem negotiation.

<LI>Your computer name is duplicated on the network.

<LI>The connectoid you are using is damaged.

<LI>Your port settings are incorrect.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the appropriate method:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
If the protocols used by the server and the Dial-Up Networking client do
not match, modify the protocols used by the client so that at least one
protocol matches.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
If a protocol used by the Dial-Up Networking client is not available,
install the protocol from Control Panel and bind it to the Dial-Up
Networking adapter.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
Make sure you have the correct server type selected in the connection's
properties (PPP, SLIP, or RAS).
<P>
<P><h3>Method 4</h3>
 
<P>
Perform the following steps to enable a terminal login:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and
   then click Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the connection, and then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>On the General tab, click Configure.

<P><LI>On the Options tab, click "Bring up terminal window after dialing."

<P><LI>Click OK until all dialog boxes are closed.
<P>
</OL>When you connect, enter your user name and password as prompted by your
provider.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 5</h3>
 
<P>
If a network adapter is installed, try removing the binding for TCP/IP
from the network adapter. Try this method only after trying all the other
methods listed in this article. If this works, and you have other
protocols installed, you can leave TCP/IP unbound from the network
adapter. If this is the only protocol you have installed, you must bind
the TCP/IP protocol to the network adapter before you can use the network.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 6</h3>
 
<P>
Make sure there are no duplicate computer names on the network.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 7</h3>
 
<P>
Delete the damaged connectoid and then re-create it.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 8</h3>
 
<P>
Verify your port settings are correct. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Modems.

<P><LI>Click the modem you are using for this connection, click Properties,
   and then click the Connection tab.

<P><LI>Verify that the settings under Connection Preferences are correct,
   click OK, and then click Close.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Dial-Up Networking can bind up to three protocols. The NetBEUI, IPX/SPX,
and TCP/IP protocols are used by default for a Dial-Up Networking
connectoid. However, the fact that these protocols are used by a Dial-Up
Networking connectoid does not necessarily mean that these protocols are
available. Each protocol must be installed from Control Panel and then
bound to the Dial-Up Networking adapter.
<P>
Note that the symptom described in this article can also occur if there
is a duplicate computer name on the subnet to which the remote access
server is connected.
<P>
The symptom described in this article can also occur if you are trying to
use Dial-Up Networking to connect to your CompuServe account but the
connection is not configured properly. For information about using Dial-Up
Networking to connect to CompuServe, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
