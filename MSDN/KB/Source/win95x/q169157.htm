<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you double-click a Dial-Up Networking connectoid, or when you click 
Connect within a Dial-Up Networking connectoid, you may receive one of the
following error messages:

<UL><LI>Dial-Up Networking cannot find the specified modem. Install the modem
   or select a new modem before you dial.

<LI>The modem is not plugged in or out of service. Connect a modem to your
   computer and try again.

<LI>The computer is not receiving a response from the modem. Check that
   the modem is plugged in, and if necessary, turn the modem off, and
   then turn it back on.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These error messages can occur if any of the following conditions exists:

<UL><LI>The modem specified in the connectoid is not properly connected to the
   computer.

<LI>The modem specified in the connectoid is not the modem that is
   currently connected to the computer. 

<LI>The modem specified in the connectoid has been removed from the Modems
   tool in Control Panel.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve these error messages, confirm that the modem you have specified
in the connectoid is properly connected to your computer. If the correct 
modem is properly connected to your computer and you are still receiving 
one of these error messages, use the following steps to resolve the issue.
<P>
NOTE: The following procedure can result in a loss of settings in the
Dial-Up Networking connectoid. Before you continue with these steps,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<P>
When you remove a modem from the Modems tool in Control Panel, the modem 
is not removed from any Dial-Up Networking connectoids that are configured
to use that modem. After you change a connectoid's modem to a modem that 
is currently installed in the Modems tool, the modem that you removed from
the Modems tool no longer appears in the connectoid's Connect Using list.
