<P>
This article contains a copy of information from Microsoft about anti-
virus scanners in Windows 95. This information can be found on the
following Microsoft World Wide Web page:

<P><h3>Information Regarding Anti-Virus Scanners for Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
Recently there has been some information in the press and on the Internet
about the Windows 95 versions of some anti-virus scanners not detecting
certain types of files. This is not a problem with Windows 95 itself;
rather, certain anti-virus products may be incorrectly using the Win32 API
(application programming interface) to open and read files. A detailed
technical explanation of the issue is included below.
<P>
Microsoft is working closely with anti-virus vendors to help them resolve
this issue, and, to the best of our knowledge, no customers have been
affected by this issue. McAfee Associates is planning to release an
updated version of their anti-virus scanner that addresses this issue
shortly. This page will be updated as other anti-virus vendors update
their anti-virus scanner applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Background</h3>
 
<P>
The issue specifically relates to the way that the anti-virus scanners are
attempting to open filenames that contain special "OEM" characters on the
US code page (e.g., ASCII character 229). Code pages are internal tables
that the operating system uses to relate the keys on the keyboard to the
characters displayed on the screen. Different code pages provide support
for the character sets and keyboard layouts used in different countries.
In order to open a filename that contains these OEM characters, an
application must use a specific Win32 API call so that the default
character set includes these OEM characters.
<P>
Anti-virus scanners detect infected files by first scanning the disk to
obtain a list of file names, and then analyzing (by opening and reading)
the files found. If the anti-virus scanner application does not use the
<PRE>'SetFileApisToOem' Win32 API call before trying to analyze files, it may
</PRE>be unable to open file names with these OEM characters. Using the above
Win32 API call will allow the scanner to successfully open and analyze
all file names.
