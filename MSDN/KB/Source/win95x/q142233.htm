The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience either of the following symptoms:

<UL><LI>When you remove a Plug and Play network adapter in Device Manager and
   then restart your computer, the network adapter is redetected, and you
   are logged on to the network and validated by a Microsoft Windows NT
   server without entering a password.

<LI>When you remove a PCMCIA network adapter from the PCMCIA socket in your
   computer, restart your computer, and then reinsert the PCMCIA network
   adapter, you are logged on to the network and validated by a Windows NT
   server without entering a password.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if the following conditions exist:

<UL><LI>You have a null Windows password.

<LI>Password caching is enabled.

<LI>User profiles are enabled, or the Dial-Up Networking adapter is
   installed.
<P>
</UL>When your Windows password is null and there is no network adapter
currently installed in your computer, you are not prompted to enter a
password when Windows 95 starts. Even though you do not manually enter a
password, your password list file is opened.
<P>
After the Plug and Play network adapter is detected by Windows 95, or you
reinsert the PCMCIA network adapter, Windows 95 installs the appropriate
drivers for the adapter and then attempts to log on to the network. Because
your password list file has been opened, and your Windows NT domain
password was previously cached, you are logged on and validated by the
Windows NT server without being prompted for a password.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Configure Windows 95 so that your Windows password is not null, or use
System Policy Editor to disable password caching. To configure Windows 95
so that your Windows password is not null, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Passwords.

<P><LI>Click Change Windows Password.

<P><LI>If you want your network password to be the same as your Windows
   password, click the Microsoft Networking check box to select it, and
   then click OK. If you do not want your network password to be the same
   as your Windows password, verify that the Microsoft Networking check
   box is not selected, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Type your new password in the New Password and Confirm New Password
   boxes, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You can edit the registry using System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) or
Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Check with your network administrator before
you make any changes to the registry.
<P>
System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) is available in the Admin\Apptools\
Poledit folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. Use the Add/Remove Programs tool
in Control Panel to install System Policy Editor.
<P>
NOTE: System Policy Editor is not included in the floppy disk version of
Windows 95. You can download Policy.exe, a self-extracting file containing
Poledit.exe, from online services. Please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base for information about downloading Policy.exe:

</PRE></OL>Use the following steps to edit the registry with System Policy Editor and
disable password caching in Windows 95:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, and then click Run.

<P><LI>Type "poledit" (without quotation marks) in the Open box, and then
   click OK.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open Registry, and then double-click Local
   Computer.

<P><LI>Click the plus sign (+) next to Network, and then click the plus sign
   next to Passwords.

<P><LI>Click the Disable Password Caching check box to select it, and then
   click OK.

<P><LI>Save the changes to the registry, exit System Policy Editor, and
   then restart Windows 95.
