The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to send a fax with Microsoft Fax, the fax may not be sent
completely or at all.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur when you are using a modem that uses Rockwell
Protocol Interface (RPI) compression at speeds greater than 9600 bps. The
following modems are known to use RPI compression:

<UL><LI>Zoom 14.4 PC Model 110 (internal)

<LI>Zoom 14.4 EX Model 160 (external)

<LI>Some Best Data internal 1442F fax/modems
<P>
   To determine if your Best Data internal 1442F fax/modem is an RPI
   modem, follow these steps:
<P>
   1. In Control Panel, double-click Modems.
<P>
   2. Click the Diagnostics tab.
<P>
   3. Click the COM port the modem is using, and then click More Info.
<P>
   4. Check the results in the More Info box.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, contact the modem's manufacturer to inquire
about a possible firmware upgrade or software patch that corrects this
problem in Windows 95.
<P>
If a firmware upgrade or software patch is not available, you may be able
to work around the problem by configuring the modem to operate at a slower
speed. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Mail And Fax icon.

<P><LI>Click Microsoft Fax, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>On the Modem tab, click your modem, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>Click Advanced.

<P><LI>Click the Disable High Speed Transmission and Disable Error Correction
   Mode check boxes to select them, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK until you return to Control Panel.
<P>
</OL>If you are having problems with data transmission as well as fax
transmission, you may be able to work around the problem by following
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Modems icon.

<P><LI>Click your modem, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>In the Maximum Speed box, click 9600.

<P><LI>Click OK or Close until you return to Control Panel.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Modems that use RPI compression require a special program to enable the
modem's error correction and data compression capabilities. Some
communications programs already include this functionality, and some modem
manufacturers provide a patch that implements RPI compression in Windows
and Windows for Workgroups version 3.1x. This functionality is not included
with Microsoft Fax, and the patches that are currently available from some
modem manufacturers are not compatible with Windows 95.
<P>
Because the error correction and data compression capabilities of the modem
have not been enabled, the modem is not reliable when operating at higher
speeds.
