<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run multiple programs (especially MS-DOS-based programs) on a
Windows-based computer that has insufficient system memory (RAM) and
contains an Intel Pentium Pro or Pentium II processor, you may experience
the following symptoms:
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) or 2.1 (OSR 2.1)</h3>
 
<P>
Information in memory may become unavailable or damaged, leading to
unpredictable results. For example, copy and compare operations may not
work consistently.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
Your computer may stop responding (hang).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is an indirect result of certain performance optimizations
in the Intel Pentium Pro and Pentium II processors. These optimizations
affect how the Windows 95 Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) performs certain
memory operations, such as determining which sections of memory are not in
use and can be safely freed. As a result, the Virtual Machine Manager may
free the wrong pages in memory, leading to the symptoms described earlier.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95 OEM
Service Release 2 (OSR2) only:
<P>
<PRE>   VMM.VXD version 4.00.1113  dated 9/24/97 11:13am  408,096 bytes

</PRE>This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95 OEM
Service Release 2.1 (OSR2.1) with the USB Supplement only:
<P>
<PRE>   VMM.VXD version 4.03.1216  dated 9/23/97 12:16pm  427,552 bytes

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 OEM
Service Releases 2 (OSR2) and 2.1 (OSR2.1). An update to address this
problem is now available, but is not fully regression tested and should be
