<OL><P><LI> Q. I cannot find a driver for my printer. Do Windows 3.1 printer
<P><PRE>       drivers work in Windows 95?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. Windows 3.1 printer drivers should work in Windows 95,
       although they cannot take advantage of all the printing enhance-
       ments in Windows 95.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       You may be able to obtain a Windows 95 printer driver from the
       printer's manufacturer or from Microsoft after Windows 95 is
       released. Please contact the printer's manufacturer about a
       possible printer driver upgrade.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I cannot print in Windows 95. What should I do?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Windows 95 includes a Print Troubleshooter tool. Before you perform
       any troubleshooting steps, try the Print Troubleshooter tool. To
       use the Print Troubleshooter tool, follow these steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Click the Start button, then click Help.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       2. On the Contents tab, double-click the Troubleshooting topic.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       3. Double-click the If You Have Trouble Printing topic.

       Microsoft Knowledge Base:

          TITLE     : Troubleshooting Printing Problems in Windows 95

</PRE><P><LI> Q. I can print from MS-DOS-based programs but not from Windows-based
<P><PRE>       programs. How can I fix this?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. You may be able to resolve this problem by clearing the Check Port
       State Before Printing check box. To do so, follow these steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Printers.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       2. Use the right mouse button to click the printer you want to use,
<PRE></PRE>          then click Properties on the menu that appears.

       3. On the Details tab, click Port Settings, then click the Check
          Port State Before Printing check box to clear it. Click OK.

       The BIOS in some computers incorrectly reports the printer port as
       being busy or not available. By default, Windows 95 checks for
       these errors. Clearing the Check Port State Before Printing check
       box causes Windows 95 to ignore these messages.

       If you continue to have this problem, use LPT1.DOS as the printer
       port. To add this port, use the following steps:

       1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Printers.

       2. Use the right mouse button to click the printer you want to use,
          then click Properties on the menu that appears.

       3. On the Details tab, click Add Port.

       4. Click the Other option button, click Local Port, and click OK.

       5. In the Enter A Port Name box, type "LPT1.DOS" (without quotation
          marks), and then click OK.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. I cannot print to a network printer. What can I do?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Try the following steps to troubleshoot the problem:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Print to a local printer.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       2. Print to a file, then copy the file to the print server. To do
<PRE></PRE>          so, follow these steps:

          a. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click
             Printers.

          b. Use the right mouse button to click the printer you want to
             use, then click Properties on the menu that appears.

          c. Click the Details tab.

          d. In the Print To The Following Port box, click File, and
             then click OK.

          e. Print a document from any program. When you are prompted,
             enter a filename for the print job.

          f. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click
             MS-DOS Prompt.

          g. At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following line and then press
             ENTER

                copy &lt;path&gt;&lt;filename&gt; &lt;printer port&gt;

             where &lt;path&gt; is the path to the file you created in step E,
             &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file you created in step E, and
             &lt;printer port&gt; is the port for the network printer. For
             example, if you created a file named Prntest in the root
             directory of drive C and the network printer is connected
             using the LPT1 port, type the following command:

                copy c:\prnttest lpt1

       3. Capture a printer port for the network printer rather than using
          a universal naming convention (UNC) connection. To do so, follow
          these steps:

          a. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click
             Printers.

          b. Use the right mouse button to click the printer you want to
             use, then click Properties on the menu that appears.

          c. On the Details tab, click the Capture Printer Port button.

          d. In the Device box, click the port you want to capture. In the
             Path box, enter the path for the network printer you want to
             use. Use the syntax "\\&lt;PrinterServerName&gt;\&lt;PrinterShare&gt;"
             (without quotation marks) for the network printer path.

              NOTE: If you want this connection to be available each time
              you start Windows 95, click the Reconnect At Logon check box
              to select it.

       4. Try to print the document from another computer on the network.

       5. If you still cannot print to the network printer, perform
          standard network troubleshooting steps, such as:

           - Try to browse the print server.

           - Remove and reinstall your network components.

           - If there are any spaces in the UNC name, remove them.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. The output from my color InkJet printer seems better in Windows 3.1
<P><PRE>       than in Windows 95. Why?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Even though the universal printer driver's quality of error
       diffusion and color image support has improved in Windows 95, an
       OEM printer driver may be better tuned for a specific printer. If
       you experience problems with Epson InkJet printers, use Epson's
       Windows 3.1 printer drivers. If you experience problems with Canon
       InkJet printers, use the Windows 95 printer drivers.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Does Windows 95 have printer drivers for Hewlett-Packard DeskJet
<P><PRE>       600, 660C, 660Cse, 850, or 855C printers?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Windows 95 does not include drivers for these newer Hewlett-Packard
       DeskJet printers. Use the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 550C printer
       driver until Hewlett-Packard releases drivers for these printers.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why can I not print to my Hewlett-Packard JetDirect printer from
<P><PRE>       MS-DOS-based programs?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. If you install the JetDirect services in Direct mode, you cannot
       capture a printer port. If you cannot capture a printer port, you
       cannot print from MS-DOS-based programs.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why can I not print to my QMS Jetscript printer in Windows 95?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Windows 95 does not support QMS Jetscript printers. You may be able
       to use your QMS Jetscript printer by printing to the LPT1.DOS port.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Does Windows 95 support LaserMaster printers that use the
<P><PRE>       Winspool.drv driver?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Windows 95 does not support the use of the Winspool.drv driver. You
       may be able to print to LaserMaster devices using the appropriate
       Hewlett-Packard printer driver. In general, if the LaserMaster
       device requires fonts to be downloaded at an MS-DOS level, it will
       not work in Windows 95. Later versions of LaserMaster PostScript
       printers may work with Windows 95. For additional information,
       please contact LaserMaster.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       NOTE: LaserMaster devices are add-on computer I/O cards that attach
       to Hewlett-Packard Series II and series III printers.
