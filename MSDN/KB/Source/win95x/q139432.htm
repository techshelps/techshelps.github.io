The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has released an updated version of OLE for Windows 95. This
update corrects the following problems:

<UL><LI>File management behavior in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and
   Microsoft Word for Windows.

<LI>Closing multiple 16-bit ODBC programs or multiple Visual Basic 4.0
   applications using some OCX controls in a certain order may cause
   your computer to stop responding (hang).

<LI>Links between OLE objects are not saved when you move them from a
   directory structure on a network drive to the same directory structure
   on a different network drive.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>File Management Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
Due to the way Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft Word
for Windows use OLE for file storage, documents created in these programs
may contain extraneous data from previously deleted files. This extraneous
data is not visible within the document and does not affect your ability
to use these programs normally. However, it is possible that legible
portions of previously deleted files may be viewable if you examine these
document files using Notepad or file-utility software.
<P>
This situation may pose security and privacy concerns with electronic
versions of these documents.
<P>
Note that this situation does not affect users of Microsoft Windows NT
because Windows NT initializes disk space that was used by deleted files.
<P>
To prevent extraneous data from being included in new document files,
install the OLE update using the instructions in the "Installing the OLE
Update" section of this article. After you install the update, extraneous
data is not included in new document files.
<P>
To remove extraneous data from existing documents, open and then save the
documents after you install the OLE update. In Word for Windows, disable
the Allow Fast Saves option before you save your documents. To disable
this option in Word, click Options on the Tools menu, click the Save tab,
click the Allow Fast Saves check box to clear it, and then click OK. You
can enable the Allow Fast Saves option again after you save your documents.
<P>
This update is recommended for users of the following products:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95 version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95 version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95 version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows version 6.0
<P>
</UL>NOTE: You need this update if you are using Word for Windows 6.0 only if
you run this version of Word on a Windows 95-based computer. If you use
Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups, you do not need this update;
however, you should upgrade your version of Word for Windows to version
6.0c.
<P>
<P><h3>Closing 16-Bit Programs</h3>
 
<P>
When you run multiple 16-bit ODBC programs or multiple Visual Basic 4.0
applications using some OCX controls (for example, GRID16.OCX) at the same
time and you then close these programs, your computer may hang.
<P>
<P><h3>Links Not Saved When Moved on Network Drives</h3>
 
<P>
If links are established between OLE objects within a given directory
structure on a network drive and the objects are then moved to a different
drive with the same directory structure, the links are not maintained. If
this same operation is performed on a local drive, the links are
maintained.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the OLE Update</h3>
 
<P>
To install the OLE update, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Download the Oleupd.exe file from the Microsoft Software Library to an
   empty folder.

<P><LI>In My Computer or Windows Explorer, double-click the Oleupd.exe file
   you downloaded in step 1.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions on your screen.
<P>
</OL>The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:
<P>
<PRE> ~ <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/Oleupd.exe">Oleupd.exe</A> <I>(size: 506952 bytes)</I> 

</PRE></OL>For more information about downloading files from the Microsoft Software
Library, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE><h3>Files Installed</h3>
 
<P>
The following files are installed when you install the OLE update:
<P>
<PRE>   File name      Folder           Size      Date       Version
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   Compobj.dll    Windows\System    31,120   01/25/96   2.20.40.44
   Ole32.dll      Windows\System   558,704   01/25/96   2.10.35.38
   Olethk32.dll   Windows\System    79,424   01/25/96   2.10.35.38

</PRE>The OLE32 Update checks the versions of the files currently installed on
your computer. If you have newer versions of these files, they are not
replaced.
<P>
<P><h3>Service Pack 1</h3>
 
<P>
The OLE32 Update in Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1 includes Ole32.dll
version 2.10.35.37 and fixes only the file management behavior problem
described in this article. Service Pack 1 does not fix the other problems
described in this article.
