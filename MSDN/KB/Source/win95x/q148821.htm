95
WINDOWS
kbhw
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you perform one of the following actions, the contents of some
Enhanced IDE (EIDE) hard disks may not seem to be correct:

<UL><LI>Choosing "Restart the computer in MS-DOS mode" from the Shut Down
   menu.

<LI>Starting an MS-DOS-based program that is configured to run in
   MS-DOS mode.
<P>
</UL>Specifically, if there are multiple partitions on a large EIDE hard disk,
the extended partitions (usually drive letters D and higher) seem to
contain the contents of the primary partition (usually drive C), or to be
corrupted.
<P>
WARNING: In this situation, attempts to use disk-repair utilities such as
ScanDisk to repair the apparent corruption will cause data corruption on
the primary partition of the affected drive.
<P>
Any action that attempts to write data to the extended partitions when
this symptom is observed may also result in data corruption.
<P>
Running the CHKDSK command when this symptom is observed may result in a
"Probable non-DOS disk" message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This situation is known to occur only when all of the following conditions
exist:

<UL><LI>The hard disk is a large (&gt;504 MB) Enhanced IDE hard disk.

<LI>The hard disk is accessed using Logical Block Addressing (LBA).

<LI>The hard disk has been partitioned into multiple partitions with
   the Windows 95 version of FDISK, or another partitioning utility
   that creates MS-DOS extended partition types 0x0E and 0x0F.

<LI>The system BIOS supports INT13 extensions to access hard disk
   devices.

<LI>You have exited to MS-DOS mode from Windows 95 without rebooting
   the computer.
<P>
</UL>Under these circumstances, certain data structures maintained by the
operating system for accessing these logical drives become corrupted in
the transition from protected mode to real mode.
<P>
This does not occur when you boot the computer to a command prompt or from
a floppy disk.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95:
<P>
<PRE>   DISKTSD.VXD version 4.00.952 (dated 3/22/96) and later

   TITLE     : Windows 95 Support for Large IDE Hard Disks

</PRE><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
To work around this issue, in the event you do not have the updated
DSKTSUPD.EXE file, use either of the following methods:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
Avoid exiting to MS-DOS mode from within Windows 95. To run programs that
require MS-DOS mode, boot to a command prompt instead of Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
Repartition the hard disk using one of the following methods.
<P>
WARNING: Repartitioning the hard disk will delete all data in the current
partitions (logical disks). Make sure to back up your data before
repartitioning the hard disk.

<UL><LI>Repartition the hard disk into a single primary partition.

<LI>Repartition the hard disk by starting FDISK with the following
   command line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      FDISK /X
</PRE><P>
   This disables support for the LBA extended partition types 0x0E and
   0x0F, and uses the older partition types 0x05 and 0x06 instead.

<LI>Repartition the hard disk with an older version of FDISK (prior to
   Windows 95) that does not support the LBA extended partition types.

<LI>Repartition the hard disk using a third-party tool that does not use
   the LBA extended partition types.
