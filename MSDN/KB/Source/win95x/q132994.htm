<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists games (A-H) that must be run in MS-DOS mode. Additional
information is provided when available.
<P>
For information about running games in MS-DOS mode, please see the "Running
an Application in MS-DOS Mode" section later in this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>1942: The Pacific Air War by Microprose</h3>
 
<P>
Executables: 1942.BAT, 1942.EXE
<P>
1942: The Pacific Air War requires MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Aces of the Deep by Dynamix (Sierra Online)</h3>
 
<P>
Executables: AOD.BAT, AOD.EXE
<P>
If you run Aces of the Deep in Windows 95, it encounters internal assertion
failures. Run it in MS-DOS mode to resolve these errors.
<P>
<P><h3>Aegis: Guardian of the Fleet</h3>
 
<P>
Executables: AEGIS.EXE, AEGISV.EXE
<P>
Aegis sets the timer rate to a speed faster than the game can handle.
Running it in MS-DOS mode may alleviate some of the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Archon Ultra by Free Fall Associates</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: ARCHON.EXE
<P>
Archon Ultra sets the timer rate to a speed too fast for Windows 95 to
handle comfortably. Running it in MS-DOS mode allows the program to run at
full speed.
<P>
<P><h3>Arctic Baron by Ready Soft</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: START.EXE
<P>
Arctic Baron requires MS-DOS mode to run in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h3>Are You Afraid of the Dark? by Viacom</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: AFRAID.BAT
<P>
Are You Afraid of the Dark? uses virtual memory in a way that causes
erratic sound and speech. Depending on your system configuration, it may
also fail during sound and video playback. Run it in MS-DOS mode to resolve
these problems.
<P>
<P><h3>Battle Chess 4000 by Interplay</h3>
 
<P>
Battle Chess requires MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Battledrome by Dynamix (Sierra Online)</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: BD.EXE
<P>
Battledrome is not compatible with VSHARE; therefore, it must be run in
MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Beneath a Steel Sky</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: SKY.EXE
<P>
Beneath a Steel Sky uses a memory model not compatible with Windows 95. Run
it in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Bioforge by Origin</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: BIOFORGE.EXE
<P>
Bioforge makes incorrect assumptions about the system memory configuration
when Windows 95 is running. This causes it to fail to detect most of the
memory installed in the computer. It must be run in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Bloodnet by Microprose</h3>
 
<P>
Bloodnet works only when the DMA channel is set to 7 if you are using the
Pro Audio Spectrum sound card. The game tries to reconfigure the sound
device to DMA 7 automatically. This is not tolerated by the virtual device
driver (VxD).
<P>
To resolve this issue, you can use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Use Sound Blaster-compatible mode on your PAS.

<LI>Reconfigure the PAS device to DMA 7.

<LI>Use MS-DOS mode.
<P>
</UL><h3>Brett Hull Hockey 95 by Accolade</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: HOCKEY.EXE
<P>
Brett Hull Hockey 95 requires MS-DOS mode and a properly set BLASTER
environment variable in order to play sound.
<P>
<P><h3>Bridge Olympiad by Quantum Quality Products</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: BO.BAT
<P>
Bridge Olympiad directly accesses the hard disk ports resulting in a
conflict with Windows 95 disk drivers. It must be run in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Chessmaster 3000 by The Software Toolworks</h3>
 
<P>
Chessmaster 3000 requires MS-DOS mode. Even in MS-DOS mode, if digital
sound is enabled, your computer may (stop responding) hang after sound
effects.
<P>
Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Simulator,
<P><h3>Chuck Yeager's Air Combat by Electronic Arts</h3>
 
<P>
Executables: AFS.EXE, AFS.BAT
<P>
In order to play speech and sound effects through the computer's built-in
speaker, these programs set the timer rate to a speed too fast for Windows
95 to handle comfortably. Running the programs in MS-DOS mode allows them
to run at full speed.
<P>
Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Simulator may also encounter copy protection
problems if not run in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Club Dead by Viacom</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: DEAD.EXE
<P>
Club Dead contains timing-related problems that cause the program to fail.
It must be run in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Comanche Overkill by Nova Logic</h3>
 
<P>
Executables: C.BAT, COMANCHE.EXE
<P>
Comanche Overkill requires complete control of the computer and must be run
in MS-DOS mode. Windows 95 should automatically run this program in MS-DOS
mode. If it does not, remove all .PIF files associated with COMANCHE.EXE or
C.BAT and restart the game.
<P>
<P><h3>Command Adventures Starship by Future Visionary, Inc. and Merit Software</h3>
 
<P>

successful and corrupts itself if a memory allocation subsequently fails.
You may be able to run this game in Windows 95 by adding "/NUMHANDLES=40"
(without the quotation marks) to the HIMEM.SYS line in the CONFIG.SYS file.
This setting increases the number of XMS handles available. If this does
not work, run Command Adventures Starship in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Curse of the Catacombs by FroggMan</h3>
 
<P>
Curse of the Catacombs requires MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Cyber Race</h3>
 
<P>

be run in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>CyberWar by Sales Curve International</h3>
 
<P>
If you use an ESS ES688 and no MIDI, you must use IRQ 5. If you have
problems, run CyberWar in MS-DOS mode.
<P>

encountering this problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Dark Forces by Lucas Arts</h3>
 
<P>
During the installation of Dark Forces, the sound detection must run twice

some computers. If you encounter problems, run Dark Forces in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Darkseed by Cyberdreams, Inc.</h3>
 
<P>
Executable: DS.BAT
<P>

<P>
Death Gate fails on some sound cards (such as ESS ES688 and Aztech WA
cards). Run Death Gate in MS-DOS mode if you encounter problems.
<P>
<P><h3>Dino Park Tycoon 1.0 by MECC</h3>
 
<P>
Dino Park Tycoon runs in Windows 95 only if sound is disabled. To use
sound, you must run this game in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Dognapped by FroggMan</h3>
 
<P>
Dognapped sets the timer rate too fast for some computers. If you encounter
problems with Dognapped in Windows 95, run it in MS-DOS mode.

<P>
<P><h3>Grand Prix by Road and Track</h3>
 
<P>
Grand Prix does not run well in an MS-DOS session when you are using the
PC speaker as the designated sound output device. System performance slows
considerably because of the increased timer load by the PC speaker. To
boost performance with this game, run the game in MS-DOS mode, or turn
off the PC speaker sound.

with Windows 95. It must be run in MS-DOS mode.
<P>
<P><h3>The Humans by GameTek</h3>
 
<P>

allows it to run at full speed.
<P>
<P><h3>Running an Application in MS-DOS Mode</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 usually runs programs that require MS-DOS mode in MS-DOS mode
automatically. If it does not, delete the corresponding .PIF file and
double-click the program icon again. Note that .PIF files usually have the
same name as the program file, but with a .PIF extension instead of the
.BAT, .COM, or .EXE extension. The corresponding .PIF file can be found in
one of the following locations:

<UL><LI>In the folder that contains the program file.

<LI>In the hidden PIF folder in the Windows 95 folder.

<LI>In a folder specified by your PATH statement.
<P>
</UL>To make certain you find all copies of the .PIF file, use the Find Files
Or Folders feature.
<P>
If Windows 95 does not configure the program to run in MS-DOS mode
automatically, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the executable file with the right mouse button, then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>On the Program tab, click the Advanced button.

<P><LI>Click the MS-DOS Mode check box to select it.

<P><LI>You can usually use the Use Current MS-DOS Configuration option.
   However, some programs may require that you use the Specify A New
   Configuration option. Consult the program's documentation for sample
   CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>These steps cause the program to run in MS-DOS mode. You may need to
optimize the settings if the program requires a mouse, expanded memory, a
CD-ROM drive, or a sound card. Consult the program's documentation to
determine if it has specific needs.
<P>
NOTE: You may have to double-click the program icon in Windows Explorer or
My Computer, or type the program name in the Run dialog box, for the
program's settings to take effect. Typing the program name at an MS-DOS
prompt does not always cause the program's settings to be used.
