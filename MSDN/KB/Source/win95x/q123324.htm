<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a brief description of the file transfer protocols
supported by HyperTerminal.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Kermit</h3>
 
<P>
Kermit is a public domain protocol developed at Columbia University. It is
a sliding-window protocol that supports batch file transfers and has a
maximum block size of 94 bytes. It uses either half or full duplex. Kermit
is unique because it supports either 7-bit or 8-bit data transmission,
enabling PC to mainframe transfers. Kermit uses either CRC or Checksum
error correction. Kermit transfers the filename, date, and size.
<P>
<P><h3>X-Modem</h3>
 
<P>
X-Modem is a public domain 8-bit, error-checking communications protocol.
It is a single file protocol, has a block size of 128 bytes, and transmits
using half-duplex. The filename, date, and size are not transmitted by
X-Modem. You must provide the name of the file being downloaded. X-Modem
uses either CRC or Checksum error checking, with CRC being the default.
<P>
<P><h3>X-Modem-1K</h3>
 
<P>
X-Modem-1K is identical to X-Modem except that the block size is 1024
bytes.
<P>
<P><h3>Y-Modem</h3>
 
<P>
The Y-Modem protocol is virtually the same as X-Modem, with one exception.
Y-Modem uses 1024-byte blocks compared to the X-Modem 128-byte block.
Because of its larger block size, Y-Modem is generally faster than X-Modem
on a noise-free line. On noisy lines, X-Modem may be faster because when an
error occurs, the block must be re-sent. Y-Modem must retransmit a 1024-
byte block; with X-Modem's smaller blocks, less data has to be re-sent.
<P>
<P><h3>Y-Modem-G</h3>
 
<P>
Y-Modem-G is a variant of the Y-Modem protocol. Y-Modem-G is a streaming
protocol that sends 1024-byte blocks until instructed to stop. Y-Modem-G
supports batch transfers. This protocol does not provide error correction
or recovery. If an error is detected, the transfer is aborted. On a noise-
free phone line using error-correcting modems, Y-Modem-G may be the fastest
protocol.
<P>
NOTE: Y-Modem-G does not provide error correction or recovery. It is
designed specifically for high-speed error-correcting modems using V.42 or
other hardware error correction.
<P>
<P><h3>Z-Modem</h3>
 
<P>
The Z-Modem file transfer protocol provides reliable file transfers with
complete end-to-end data integrity. Z-Modem uses 32-bit CRC error
correction and a sliding-window block up to 1024 bytes in length. Z-Modem
uses intelligent error recovery, which automatically decreases block size
if the phone line deteriorates and attempts to increase block size as the
phone line improves. Z-Modem also provides automatic downloads. When the
host computer begins transferring using Z-Modem, the remote computer
recognizes this and begins receiving the download automatically.
