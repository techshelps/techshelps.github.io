<OL><P><LI> Q. What versions of MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows can I upgrade to
<P><PRE>       Windows 95?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. You can upgrade Windows version 3.0 or later, Windows for
       Workgroups version 3.1 or later, or MS-DOS or OEM-DOS version
       3.2 or later.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Should I run the Windows 95 Setup program from MS-DOS or from
<P><PRE>       an existing version of Windows?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Windows 95 Setup runs from MS-DOS, Windows version 3.1 or
       later, or Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 or later. If you
       are running Windows version 3.1 or later or Windows for
       Workgroups version 3.1 or later, we recommend that you run
       Windows 95 Setup from within Windows.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. When I run Windows 95 Setup in Windows 3.0, Setup tells me that
<P><PRE>       it requires a newer version of Windows. How do I upgrade
       Windows 3.0?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. To upgrade Windows 3.0 to Windows 95, run Setup from MS-DOS and
       choose to install Windows 95 in the same directory as Windows
       3.0.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Can I install Windows 95 on a computer that dual-boots Windows
<P><PRE>       NT(TM) and MS-DOS?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. To install Windows 95 on a computer that dual-boots
       Windows NT and MS-DOS, start the computer in MS-DOS and run
       Setup either in Windows 3.1 or at an MS-DOS prompt. You cannot
       install Windows 95 in a directory with a shared Windows 3.1 and
       Windows NT configuration. In this situation, you must install
       Windows 95 in a different directory.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       If your computer boots Windows NT, you must configure the
       computer to dual-boot MS-DOS and Windows NT and follow the
       instructions in the paragraph above. If you start the computer
       from an MS-DOS disk and then run Setup, you will no longer be
       able to boot Windows NT. However, you can restore Windows NT by
       starting the computer from the Windows NT Boot/Repair disk and
       then selecting the Repair option.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Can I install Windows 95 and still boot MS-DOS and Windows 3.1?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Windows 95 supports booting the earlier version of the
       operating system if you are using MS-DOS version 5.0 or later
       or IBM(R) PC-DOS version 5.0 or later. You cannot boot any
       version of DR DOS(R) . When you install Windows 95 in a new
       directory, Setup automatically makes the required adjustments
       so the computer can dual-boot Windows 95 and MS-DOS. To boot MS-
       DOS on a Windows 95 computer with dual-boot enabled, press F4
       or F8 when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       If you install Windows 95 in a new directory, you must
       reinstall all your Windows-based programs for them to run
       properly in Windows 95. If you upgrade your earlier version of
       Windows to Windows 95, you do not need to reinstall your
       Windows-based programs because Windows 95 retains your
       settings.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I upgraded my installed versions of MS-DOS and Windows to
<P><PRE>       Windows 95. How can I boot my earlier version of MS-DOS?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Although you cannot run the earlier version of Windows, you can
       boot the earlier version of MS-DOS. To do so, use the following
       three steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Type the following command at an MS-DOS prompt to remove the
<PRE></PRE>          system, hidden, and read-only attributes of the Msdos.sys
          file:

             attrib c:\msdos.sys -s -h -r

       2. Use a text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the Msdos.sys
          file and add the following line to the [Options] section of
          the file:

             BootMulti=1

       3. Restart your computer and press F4 or F8 when you see the
          "Starting Windows 95" message.

          NOTE: When you boot an earlier version of MS-DOS, some of
          the MS-DOS commands may not work. This behavior occurs
          because Windows 95 removes some MS-DOS utilities.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. Can I install Windows 95 on a computer running IBM OS/2(R)?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Setup does not run in OS/2. However, you can install Windows 95
       on a computer running OS/2 if you boot MS-DOS and run Setup
       from the MS-DOS prompt.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       If you use OS/2 Boot Manager to choose operating systems at
       startup, note that Windows 95 Setup disables Boot Manager to
       ensure that it can restart the computer and complete the
       installation. You can reactivate Boot Manager by running the
       FDISK tool that is shipped with Windows 95.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       If you do not use OS/2 Boot Manager, you must configure your
       computer to use Boot Manager and then follow the instructions
       above.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Does Windows 95 Setup work on a hard disk compressed with
<P><PRE>       Stacker(R)?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. Windows 95 is compatible with Stacker version 2.0 or
       later, and with all versions of SuperStor(tm). Before you start
       Setup, make sure there is at least 1.5 megabytes (MB) of free
       hard disk space on the host drive, or 8 MB if you use a
       permanent swap file. If there is not enough free space on the
       host drive, you must run a utility from the compression
       software's manufacturer to increase the amount of free hard
       disk space on the host drive.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Can I install Windows 95 on a hard disk partitioned with
<P><PRE>       OnTrack Disk Manager?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. Windows 95 is compatible with Disk Manager and even
       provides a protected-mode driver for Disk Manager version 6.03
       or later. If you use Disk Manager version 6.03 or later,
       Windows 95 automatically uses its protected-mode driver.
</PRE>
<PRE>10. Q. After I set up Windows 95, I cannot access my CD-ROM drive.
       What do I do?

    A. If your CD-ROM drive is not recognized by Windows 95, use the
       following steps:

       1. Make sure the correct real-mode driver for the CD-ROM drive
          is installed on the hard disk. This driver is normally
          shipped with the CD-ROM drive kit. If you do not have this
          driver, please contact the CD-ROM drive manufacturer.

       2. Verify that the correct driver statement is in the
          Config.sys file, and that the driver statement specifies the
          correct path for the driver. For details about the specific
          driver statement for your CD-ROM drive, please consult the
          CD-ROM drive documentation or manufacturer.

       3. Verify that Mscdex.exe is being loaded in the Autoexec.bat
          file, and that the Mscdex statement loads the Mscdex.exe
          file from the Windows\Command folder. For information about
          the Mscdex statement settings, please consult the CD-ROM
          drive documentation or manufacturer.

       4. Restart Windows 95.
