<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information about the updates included with
Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1.
<P>
For information about obtaining Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Availability of Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following updates are provided with Microsoft Windows 95 Service
Pack 1 and are installed when you run Setup.exe.
<P>
<P><h3>File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks Update</h3>
 
<P>
Vserver.vxd
New file version: 4.0.0.952
<P>
This update corrects a problem with File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft
Networks and Samba's SMBCLIENT UNIX network client. The update corrects a
problem with share-level security and includes a correction for a similar
problem with user-level security that Microsoft recently discovered as part
of its internal testing of the new driver. Windows 95 allows users of the
Samba SMB client to access the drive on which sharing is enabled by
accepting certain specific networking commands. The Samba client is the
only known SMB client that sends such networking commands.
<P>
SMBCLIENT users do not automatically have access to the drive on the
Windows 95-based computer, and must know the exact steps to send these
commands. The updated driver prevents Windows 95 from accepting these
commands, preventing SMBCLIENT users from accessing the drive on which
sharing is enabled. With the updated driver, the SMBCLIENT user has access
only to those shared folders that the Windows 95 user has designated. For
more information on this update, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Updated Drivers for File and Printer Sharing Security

</PRE><h3>File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks Update</h3>
 
<P>
File: Nwserver.vxd
New file version: 4.0.0.951
<P>
Microsoft recently became aware of an issue with File and Printer Sharing
for NetWare Networks that may affect data security for corporate users. If
your computer is configured for file and printer sharing and the Remote
Administration service is enabled, another user on the network may gain
read-only access to your computer after the administrator has logged off
and before you have restarted your computer. To correct this problem,
Microsoft has released an updated driver for File and Printer Sharing for
NetWare Networks. The updated driver ensures that only valid administrators
have access to the computer's hard disk.
<P>

   TITLE     : Updated Drivers for File and Printer Sharing Security

</PRE><h3>LPT Port Driver Update for ECP Ports</h3>
 
<P>
File: Lpt.vxd
New file version: 4.0.0.951
<P>
Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1 automatically installs a version of
the parallel port driver (Lpt.vxd) that corrects issues seen on some
computers equipped with ECP ports. This driver is functionally identical
to Lpt.vxd version 4.0.0.503, which is included on the Windows 95 CD-ROM
in the Drivers\Printer\Lpt folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks Update</h3>
 
<P>
File: Vredir.vxd
New file version: 4.0.0.955
<P>
The Client for Microsoft Networks update fixes a problem that affects only
Windows 95 users who use Samba servers. The problem arises from the basic
Windows 95 and UNIX file name formats. UNIX allows file names that include
the "\" and "*" characters, but these are wildcard characters in Windows
95. If a Samba server contains a file named \\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;share&gt;\*.* (which
is a valid UNIX file name), and you try to delete this file from a Windows
95-based computer using Windows Explorer or My Computer, all the files on
\\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;share&gt; are deleted instead. The updated version of the Client
for Microsoft Networks prevents this from occurring by rejecting file names
that contain the "\" or "*" characters.
<P>

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Deleting Files on Samba Servers May Delete Local Files
               Instead

</PRE><h3>Microsoft OLE32 Update</h3>
 
<P>
File: Ole32.dll
New file version: 2.10.35.37
<P>
The Windows 95 OLE32 update addresses file-management behavior in
Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95,
versions 7.0. Because of the way these programs use OLE for file storage,
document files created in these programs may contain extraneous data from
previously deleted files. This data is not visible while you use the
programs. However, it may be possible to view a document file using
Notepad or file-utility software and find legible pieces of information
from previously deleted files. This may pose information security and
privacy concerns if you distribute electronic versions of files created
using these programs. The OLE32 update corrects this behavior. Although
the problem is known to occur only in Microsoft Excel, Word, and
PowerPoint for Windows 95, the OLE32 update is designed to prevent any
program from potentially causing the same problem.
<P>
NOTE: There is a newer OLE update for Windows 95 than the update contained
in Service Pack 1. The newer update fixes the problem described above, as
well as two other issues. For information about the newer update, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q139432.htm">Q139432</A></B>
   TITLE     : OLE Update for Windows 95

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Plus! System Agent Update Update</h3>
 
<P>
File: Sage.dll
New file version: 4.40.0.311
<P>
The Microsoft Plus! Update Kit provides an updated version of the Sage.dll
file to fix a minor problem with System Agent. When System Agent version
1.0 is running, programs that perform floating-point calculations may be
slightly off in precision. This problem does not occur if System Agent is
disabled. For more information on this update, see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q140479.htm">Q140479</A></B>
   TITLE     : Updated Sage.dll File Corrects Floating-Point Math Errors

</PRE><h3>Windows 95 Common Dialog Update</h3>
 
<P>
File: Comdlg32.dll
New file version: 4.0.0.951
<P>
This update corrects an issue that occurs when 32-bit programs print using
Windows 3.1 monolithic drivers or the Windows 3.1 Pscript.drv and
Unidrv.dll drivers in Windows 95. When you use this configuration, the
program may stop responding (hang).
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95 Password List Update</h3>
 
<P>
File: Mspwl32.dll
New file version: 4.0.0.951
<P>
File: Net.exe
New file version: 4.00.951
<P>
The Windows 95 Password List update version 4.00.951 protects your password
file against potential security violations. When you connect to a password-
protected resource, such as a network drive, you can choose to save that
password. Windows 95 then stores the password in an encrypted file on your
hard disk. Recently, an algorithm was posted on the Internet for decrypting
this file. If someone has access to your password file and knows the
decryption algorithm, he or she may be able to decrypt it and the passwords
it contains, gaining access to the password-protected resources. The
Password List update provides vastly improved encryption that is 2^96 (2 to
the 96th power) harder to decrypt than the previous encryption method.
<P>
Microsoft has released the Windows 95 Password List update version
9.00.952. For more information on this update, see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Enhanced Encryption for Windows 95 Password Cache

</PRE><h3>Windows 95 Shell Update</h3>
 
<P>
File: Shell32.dll
New file version: 4.0.0.951
<P>
This update to the Windows 95 Shell32.dll file fixes a problem in which a
file copied onto itself can be truncated to a zero-length file. This occurs
only in the following circumstances:

<UL><LI>When you copy a file onto itself using two different views of the same
   network resource (these can be different mapped drive letters or UNC
   connections to a network resource).

<LI>When you copy a file onto itself using a drive that was created by the
   SUBST command.
<P>
</UL>This update to the Shell32.dll file also makes it possible to browse Novell
NetWare Directory Service printers from the Add Printer Wizard (provided
you have installed the Service for NetWare Directory Services).
