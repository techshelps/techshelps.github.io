<P><h2>UNIMODEM V FUNCTIONALITY</h2>
 
<P>
Unimodem V is the newest release of Unimodem, the Windows universal
modem driver/telephony service provider for data/fax modems. Unimodem
V adds the most commonly requested features to support data/fax/voice
modems, including wave playback and recording to and from the phone
line, wave playback and recording to and from the handset, and
support for speakerphones, caller ID, distinctive ringing, and call
forwarding.
<P>
This release provides .inf files for some specific modems; however,
Unimodem V provides base support, with the addition of an .inf file,
for any voice modem based on one of the specific supported chipsets
(Rockwell, Cirrus, AT&amp;T) or any other AT+V/AT#V standard modem.
Support for Sierra chipsets is in progress and will be available
soon. Information on the process for creating .inf files can be found
on ftp.microsoft.com in the developr\drg\modem directory.
<P>
The Unimodem V specification, which describes new features and what
you need to know about wave drivers, is located on the Microsoft ftp
site (ftp.microsoft.com or 198.105.232.1) in the \Developer\Tapi
directory.
<P>
The Unimodem V software consists of the following parts:

<OL><P><LI>The Unimodem V Telephony Service Provider (TSP) and VxD. The TSP
   handles program requests, such as dialing and answering, which are
   passed down from TAPI. The TSP hides modem-specific details of how
   telephony operations, such as dialing, are handled. The VxD is called
   by the TSP to send command strings to the modem. It is called by the
   VCOMM VxD to change modem settings and send/receive data to/from the
   modem.

<P><LI>Operator Agent, a program that identifies whether an incoming call is
   from a person, a fax machine, or a data modem. It then forwards the
   call to the appropriate program, such as the answering machine or fax
   program. If Operator Agent can't automatically determine the type of
   call, it asks the caller to identify it. If the caller cannot identify
   it, Operator Agent forwards the call to a program specified by the user.
<P>
   To start Operator Agent, click the Start button, point to Programs,
   point to Accessories, and then click Operator. When Operator Agent is
   running, an icon appears on the taskbar near the clock.

<P><LI>A wave driver for serial port modems that supports the following
   formats: IMA ADPCM at 4800 kHz, 7200 kHz, or 8000 kHz; and Rockwell
   ADPCM.

<P><LI>A wave wrapper for use with modems with a separate audio hardware
   interface, where synchronization is needed between the modem and audio
   via AT commands. The wave wrapper is called by MMSystem, and it calls
   Unimodem V to send any needed AT commands to the modem. After the AT
   commands are complete, the wave wrapper calls back into MMSystem, and
   MSystem then calls the modem wave device. The modem wave device
   interfaces only with the audio hardware interface.

<P><LI>A wave driver for the Compaq Presario, which uses the wave wrapper.

<P><LI>The following .inf files for modems currently supported by Unimodem V:
<P>
<PRE>   mdmcpq.inf    Compaq Presario models 520, 720, 820, and 920
   tamwrap.inf   Presario wave driver and wrapper
   mdmdsi.inf    Creative Labs Phone Blaster
   mdmrock.inf   Logicode 14.4 data/fax/voice PCMCIA
   mdmrock2.inf  Diamond Multimedia TeleCommander 2500
   mdmrock2.inf  Cirrus Logic
   mdmrock3.inf  Aztech Systems
   mdmrock4.inf  Rockwell PCMCIA reference design


</PRE></OL><h2>INSTALLING THE UNIMODEM V SOFTWARE</h2>
 
<P>
To install Unimodem V, you must have a PC running Microsoft(r) Windows(r)
95. These instructions assume that you have already successfully
installed the modem hardware according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
<P>
To install Unimodem V software, carry out the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run Unimodv.exe, which will automatically extract all files into the
   directory you specify (\Dirname).
</OL>2. In \Dirname, right-click the file Unimodv.inf, and then click Install.
3. Restart your computer.
4. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon, and then click the
<PRE>   Device Manager tab.
</PRE></OL>5. Double-click the Modem icon.
6. In the list, click your modem, and then click Remove.
7. Click Refresh.
<P>
If the modem is Plug and Play, Windows 95 automatically detects the
modem. If the modem is not automatically detected, carry out these
additional steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Modems icon.
</OL>2. If the Install New Modem wizard does not automatically start, click
<PRE>   Add.
</PRE></OL>3. Follow the instructions on your screen to detect your modem.
<P>
NOTE: Installation of Unimodem V replaces the following Windows 95
<PRE>      components:

      Unimodem.vxd
      Unimdm.tsp
      Umdm16.dll
      Umdm32.dll

</PRE>If you remove Unimodem V from your computer at some point and want to
restore these files, the easiest way to do so is to reinstall Windows
95.
<P>
<P><h2>KNOWN PROBLEMS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Running the Operator Agent with DATA and FAX applications</h3>
 
If the Operator Agent is run with only DATA and FAX media mode
applications running, the Operator Agent will not work correctly. If
a VOICE media mode application is running with DATA and/or FAX, the
Operator Agent will work correctly.  We are working on a fix for this
problem.
