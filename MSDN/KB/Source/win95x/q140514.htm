<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has released an enhanced version of the Unimodem VxD for
Windows 95 that is optimized for use with the new line of voice-capable
modems being released by numerous vendors. These modems are listed in the
Unimodem V Readme.txt file.
<P>
To showcase some of the advanced TAPI abilities of Unimodem V, an
application known as Operator Agent is included with Unimodem V. Operator
Agent monitors the modem and directs incoming calls to Microsoft Fax,
Dial-Up Server, or a Windows 95 voice messaging application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To use Operator Agent, a voice messaging application must be running in
addition to either Dial-Up Server or Microsoft Fax. No voice messaging
application is included with Unimodem V or Windows 95.
<P>
The primary purpose of Operator Agent is to allow software application
developers to write and implement voice messaging software in Windows 95.
For information about how to use Operator Agent, please see the Readme.txt
file that is provided with Unimodem V.
<P>
NOTE: The Unimodem V Readme.txt file is also available in the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q140323.htm">Q140323</A></B>
   TITLE     : Microsoft Unimodem V Readme.txt File

</PRE>By default, Operator Agent answers calls and plays a greeting notifying
the caller to press 1 for voice mail, 2 for fax, or 3 for data. This order
can be adjusted by clicking Properties in the Microsoft Operator Agent
dialog box and then clicking Call Routing Priorities. If you change the
Call Routing properties, you must use a microphone to record a new
greeting. To change the default greeting, click Properties and then click
Initial Greeting. If Operator Agent cannot determine the type of incoming
call, it passes the call to the first application listed in the Call
Routing properties.
<P>
Please note that if a 16-bit program has control of the modem when an
incoming call is detected, Operator Agent cannot answer the call, or
displays an "Out of memory" error message.
