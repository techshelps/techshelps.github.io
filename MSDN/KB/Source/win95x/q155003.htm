<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2)
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 is version 950b of Windows 95. An OEM
Service Release is an updated version of a product for PC manufacturers
(OEMs) to preinstall on new PCs.
<P>
This product is Windows 95. It contains some new hardware support and
programs, but at its core it is Windows 95. The purpose is to allow PC
manufacturers (OEMs) to install an integrated Windows 95 product that
contains the latest available individual updates and supports recent
advances in hardware that requires core operating system support.
<P>
The retail version of Windows 95 is designed to upgrade Windows 3.x PCs.
The primary contents of this service release are intended to support new
hardware.  As such, it will be sold with the PCs that have these new
hardware capabilities. The only major feature that does not require
specific hardware support is the new version of Microsoft Internet
Explorer.
<P>
NOTE: A retail Windows 95 (version 950) installation cannot be upgraded
with Windows 95 OSR2.
<P>
At this time, there are no plans to make these features available in a step-
up, service pack, or upgrade kit for Windows 95.
<P>
Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0, and the individual updates that
are widely applicable to a general audience will be available for free
downloads from the Internet.
<P>
Microsoft reserves the right to revise and change these plans without
notice.
<P>
<P><h3>Support Boundaries</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 OSR2 is an OEM product. There will be no free support on this
product from Microsoft. Customers may be able to obtain some amount of free
support from their OEM. Microsoft will offer only fee-based support on this
product.
<P>
Any modifications made to Windows 95 OSR2 by the OEM will not be supported
by Microsoft.
<P>
Microsoft Technical Support Desktop Systems does not support OEMs, or OEM
Preinstallation Kit (OPK) issues. OEMs are supported at an OEM account
level only.
<P>
Microsoft Premier Desktop Systems supports the full functionality and
usability of OSR2 as shipped by Microsoft to the OEM. Any modifications 
made to Windows 95 OSR2 by the OEM will be supported by the OEM. 
Installation of OSR2 is supported by Microsoft OEM support at an OEM level.
On a best effort basis, Premier Desktop Systems will support installation
and setup of OSR2 as a troubleshooting step. Batch installs and netsetup are 
not supported by OSR2 and will not be supported by Premier Desktop Systems
support.
