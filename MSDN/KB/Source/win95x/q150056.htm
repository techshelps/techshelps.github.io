<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you reinstall Windows 95 or when you use the Add/Remove Programs tool
in Control Panel to add a component, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   A file being copied is older than the file currently on your computer.
   It is recommended that you keep your existing file.

      File name:    &lt;filename.ext&gt;
      Description:  &lt;description of file&gt;
      Your version: &lt;version number&gt;

   Do you want to keep this file?

</PRE>You have the option to choose Yes (to keep the existing file) or No (to
overwrite the file).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the error message in any of the following scenarios:
<P>
<P><h3>Scenario 1</h3>
 
<P>
You have the Windows 95 retail upgrade pre-installed on your computer, but
the source (compact disc or floppy disks) you are using to reinstall
Windows 95 or install a component is the Windows 95 Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM) Service Release 1.
<P>
<P><h3>Scenario 2</h3>
 
<P>
You have the Windows 95 Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Service
Release 1 pre-installed on your computer, but the source (compact disc or
floppy disks) you are using to reinstall Windows 95 or install a component
is the Windows 95 retail upgrade.
<P>
<P><h3>Scenario 3</h3>
 
<P>
A third-party application or component that you have previously installed
has overwritten one or more Windows 95 files.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Scenario 1</h3>
 
<P>
Contact the OEM vendor for assistance in properly resolving this issue.
<P>
NOTE: Using the OEM Service Release 1 compact disc to upgrade Windows 95 is
not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
<P><h3>Scenario 2</h3>
 
<P>
Contact the OEM vendor so that the vendor can provide you with the correct
source files for the version of Windows 95 installed on your computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Scenario 3</h3>
 
<P>
Choose "No" to the error message mentioned in the "Symptoms" section so
that Windows 95 overwrites the files on your system with the original
Windows 95 files. This may cause one or more of your third-party programs
to stop working properly. If this occurs, you may need to reinstall any
affected programs.
<P>
NOTE: When you reinstall your third-party program(s) (as discussed
earlier), the third-party programs may overwrite some Windows files.
Therefore, you may find that some Windows components no longer work
properly.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some OEMs may ship computers with a mismatch between their pre-installed
version of Windows 95 (OEM Service Release 1) and the Windows 95 compact
disc or floppy disks (retail Windows 95 upgrade) included with the
computer. The Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1 includes several updates
that are not included in the retail Windows 95 upgrade. The following is a
partial list of files that may be displayed in the error message mentioned
in the "Symptoms" section:
<P>
<PRE>   Nwnp32.dll
   Lpt.vxd
   Mapi32.dll
   Cdvsd.vxd
   Voltrack.vxd
   Umdm16.dll
   Umdm32.dll
