<PRE>                             SUMMARY
                             =======

</PRE>The information in this article is a copy of the information in the
Readme.txt file included with Microsoft File Transfer (Vvsetup.exe).
<P>
<PRE>                         MORE INFORMATION
                         ================

</PRE>Windows 95(R) Microsoft File Transfer
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 
<P>
These files comprise the Microsoft File Transfer application for Windows
95. You can use Microsoft File Transfer to exchange files with another
user's computer while you are talking over the telephone when both of you
have a VoiceView capable modem and Windows 95.
<P>
The Microsoft File Transfer files included in this package were placed in
the C:\VVSetup directory.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>WHEN YOU NEED THESE FILES</h2>
 
<P>
You'll need the files in this package if you have Windows 95 on disk, and
you are installing a VoiceView modem. Microsoft File Transfer is included
on the Windows 95 CD-ROM version only.
<P>
<P><h3>Errors When Installing Your VoiceView Modem</h3>
 
If you receive an error when installing your modem indicating that any of
the following Microsoft File Transfer files cannot be found:
<P>
<PRE>     FileXfer.exe
     FileXfer.hlp
     FileXfer.cnt
     Fte.dll
     Wsvv.vxd
     VVExe32.exe

</PRE>follow the instructions under the Installation section of this document.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft File Transfer is not Installed</h3>
 
Microsoft File Transfer (filexfer.exe) may not always be installed when a
VoiceView capable modem is installed. If Microsoft File Transfer is not
installed, you may be able to configure your modem as a generic VoiceView
modem so that you can use File Transfer.
<P>
If Microsoft File Transfer is not installed on your computer, first consult
your modem documentation or contact your hardware vendor to make sure that
your modem is VoiceView capable. Then, install File Transfer by following
the steps under Configuring Your Modem as a Generic VoiceView modem.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>INSTALLATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Your VoiceView Modem</h3>
 
Install your modem through the Control Panel, Modems applet. If you need
additional assistance with installing your modem under Windows 95, search
on the word "modem" in Windows 95 help.
<P>
When files are being copied, a VoiceView modem will require the File
Transfer files. When you are prompted for a path to these "missing" files,
type in "C:\VVSetup". The files will be found, and the installation will
finish.
<P>
To verify that the installation completed correctly, follow the steps below
to determine if Microsoft File Transfer is installed on your machine:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button.

<P><LI>From the Programs menu, select Accessories.

<P><LI>A menu item called File Transfer will appear if the File Transfer
   application is installed on your computer.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>Configuring Your Modem as a Generic VoiceView Modem</h3>

<OL><P><LI> Click the Start button, select Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI> Double-Click the Modems Control Panel applet.

<P><LI> Click on the modem you wish to change to generic VoiceView and then
<P><PRE>    click Properties. Make a note of the name of your modem and the port
    being used, then click OK. Keep this information in case you want to
    return your modem to the previous settings.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Click on your modem again, then click Remove.
