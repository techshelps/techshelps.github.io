This article contains frequently asked questions about Microsoft Exchange
profiles in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. What is a Microsoft Exchange profile?

   A. A Microsoft Exchange profile consists of the services you choose to
      access your mail provider(s), and provides personal address book
      storage and a personal information store. By default, Windows 95
      provides services for Microsoft Mail, Microsoft Fax, The Microsoft
      Network Online Service, CompuServe Mail, Personal Address Book, and
      Personal Information Store. Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 provides
      a service for Internet Mail.

      NOTE: The CompuServe Mail information service is included in the
      CD-ROM version of Windows 95, but not in the floppy disk version.
      To use the CompuServe Mail information service, you must have the
      CD-ROM version of Windows 95.

2. Q. How do I set up a Microsoft Exchange profile?

   A. To set up a profile, follow these steps:

      1. Double-click the Mail And Fax icon in Control Panel.

      2. If you have not set up a profile in Microsoft Exchange before,
         the Inbox Setup Wizard starts automatically. Click the options
         you want to use in your profile, and then click Next. Follow the
         instructions on the screen to finish setting up your profile.

         If you have set up a profile in Microsoft Exchange before, you
         can start the Inbox Setup Wizard by clicking Show Profiles, and
         then clicking Add. After the Inbox Setup Wizard has started,
         click the options you want to use in your profile, and then click
         Next. Follow the instructions on the screen to finish setting up
         your profile.

3. Q. Can I have more than one Microsoft Exchange profile?

   A. Yes. After you set up a profile, the Inbox Setup Wizard asks you for
      a name for the profile. You can repeat the procedure to create as
      many profiles as you want.

4. Q. How do I switch between profiles, and how does Microsoft Exchange
      know which profile to use if I have several?

   A. To switch between profiles, double-click the Mail And Fax icon in
      Control Panel, and then click Show Profiles. In the "When starting
      Microsoft Exchange, use this profile" box, click the profile you
      want to use, and then click Close. Then, start Microsoft Exchange.

      If you have multiple profiles and you have not configured Microsoft
      Exchange to prompt you for the profile to use each time you start
      Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Exchange uses the default profile
      defined in the Mail and Fax tool. If multiple users are using one
      computer, Microsoft Exchange uses each user's default profile.

      To have Microsoft Exchange prompt you for the profile to use each
      time you start Microsoft Exchange, follow these steps:

      1. In Microsoft Exchange, click Options on the Tools menu.

      2. In the "When starting Microsoft Exchange, use this profile" box,
         click "Prompt for a profile to be used," and then click OK.

      3. On the File menu, click Exit And Log Off.

      4. Restart Microsoft Exchange.

5. Q. How do I set up Microsoft Exchange profiles for multiple users on
      the same computer?

   A. When you shut down Windows 95, you have the option to log on as a
      different user. Selecting this option lets you log on as another
      user and set up new Microsoft Exchange profiles for that user. To do
      so, follow these steps:

      1. Double-click the Passwords icon in Control Panel, and then click
         the User Profiles tab.

      2. Click "Users can customize their preferences...," and then
         click OK.

      3. Have another user log on to Windows 95 and set up a profile. This
         profile is used the next time the same user logs on and starts
         Microsoft Exchange.

6. Q. When I create a profile, what is the profile's file name, and how is
      it stored?

   A. When you create a profile, the profile name and services are noted
      in the registry. There is no file or file name for the profile.
      However, personal address book (.pab) and personal information
      store (.pst) files are created for the profile and stored on the
      hard disk.

7. Q. Can I delete a profile?

   A. Yes. To delete a profile, follow these steps:

      1. Double-click the Mail And Fax icon in Control Panel.

      2. Click Show Profiles.

      3. Click the profile you want to remove, and then click Remove.

      NOTE: This procedure removes the profile, but does not remove the
      personal address book (.pab) and personal information store (.pst)
      files associated with the profile.

8. Q. If I have a profile that includes the The Microsoft Network Online
      Service information service and the Internet Mail information
      service, and The Microsoft Network is not my Internet service
      provider, how is Microsoft Exchange able to communicate with both
      The Microsoft Network and my Internet service provider?

   A. Microsoft Exchange can be configured to connect to The Microsoft
      Network and a different Internet service provider in the same
      profile, but not at the same time. For example, if Microsoft
      Exchange has already connected to The Microsoft Network to send and
      receive The Microsoft Network mail, it does not attempt to connect
      to your Internet service provider to send and receive Internet mail.

9. Q. When I send mail, Microsoft Exchange uses fax first, and MSN, The
      Microsoft Network, second. How can I configure Microsoft Exchange to
      use MSN first?

   A. You need to change the delivery sequence for the information
      services. To do so, follow these steps:

      1. Start Microsoft Exchange (Inbox).

      2. On the Tools menu, click Options.

      3. Click the Delivery tab.

      4. In the "Recipient addresses are processed by these information
         services in the following order" list, specify the order you
         want.

     5. Click OK.
