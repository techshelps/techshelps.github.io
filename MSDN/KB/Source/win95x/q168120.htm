The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When group policies have been established and the default user has also 
been configured to have policies, some default user policies may be 
applied even though the user is a member of a group with policies.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Default User policy is implemented before group policies. If the group
policy for the user does not have an option enabled or disabled, the 
Default User policy for that option is used.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you do not want any default user policies implemented, use one of the 
following methods:

<UL><LI>Using System Policy editor, open the policy file and delete the Default
   User.

<LI>Verify that every option that is set in the Default User policy is 
   either enabled or disabled in the group policy. When an option is 
   unavailable, there is no policy for the option, and it can be modified
   by setting the Default User policy. If an option is not set in the 
   group policy, settings in the Default User policy can modify the 
   option.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For example, if you have enabled the Don't Save Settings At Exit option in
the Default User policy, and you are a member of a group that has the same
option marked as not used (the option is unavailable), the Don't Save 
Settings At Exit setting is written to the registry and changes to 
settings will not be saved.
<P>
System Policy options have three states:

<UL><LI>Enabled (checked): this policy will be implemented

<LI>Disabled (cleared): this policy will not be implemented.

<LI>Unavailable (appears dimmed): this setting is unchanged from the last 
   time the user logged on.
<P>
</UL>For more information about profiles and policies, see Chapter 15 in the 
Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit.
