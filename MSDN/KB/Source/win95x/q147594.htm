The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use System Agent to schedule an MS-DOS-based program that is
configured to run in MS-DOS mode, System Agent runs the program
successfully, but may run the program again after you quit the program
and return to Windows 95. If the program's shortcut is configured so
that you are not warned before Windows 95 restarts in MS-DOS mode, it
may appear that there is no way to stop the program from running every
time you restart Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When System Agent runs an MS-DOS-based program in MS-DOS mode, it is
unable to detect that the program has finished running after you quit the
program and return to Windows 95. Because System Agent does not know that
the program has already been run successfully, it runs the program again.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the shortcut for the MS-DOS-based program is configured so that you are
warned before Windows 95 restarts in MS-DOS mode, the following message is
displayed before Windows 95 restarts in MS-DOS mode and the MS-DOS-based
program is run:
<P>
<PRE>   This program is set to run in MS-DOS mode and cannot run while other
   programs are running. All other programs will close if you choose to
   continue.

   Do you want to continue?

</PRE>To stop the MS-DOS-based program from running every time you restart
Windows 95, click No. If the shortcut for the program is configured so
that you are not warned before Windows 95 restarts in MS-DOS mode, start
Windows 95 in Safe mode and use System Agent to disable the program. To
do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>When Windows 95 restarts after you quit the MS-DOS-based program,
   press the F8 key when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, and
   then choose Safe Mode from the Startup menu.
<P>
   NOTE: If you do not see the "Starting Windows 95" message after you
   quit the MS-DOS-based program, restart your computer by pressing
   CTRL+ALT+DELETE, using the computer's reset button, or turning the
   computer off and then back on. To minimize the risk of data loss, you
   should not restart the computer while the hard disk light indicates
   that the drive is being accessed.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories,
   point to System Tools, and then click System Agent.

<P><LI>Click the MS-DOS-based program in the list of scheduled programs, and
   then click Disable on the Program menu.

<P><LI>Close System Agent and then restart Windows 95 normally.
<P>
</OL>Once you have stopped the MS-DOS-based program from running every time
you restart Windows 95, you can configure System Agent to prevent this
behavior from occurring again. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories,
   point to System Tools, and then click System Agent.

<P><LI>Click the MS-DOS-based program in the list of scheduled programs, and
   then click Change Schedule on the Program menu. In the Start At box,
   note the time at which the program is scheduled to be run.

<P><LI>Click Advanced.

<P><LI>Click the "If the program is still running, stop it at this time" check
   box to select it.

<P><LI>In the Deadline box, type the time you noted in step 2 plus one
   minute. For example, if the program is scheduled to start at 5:00 P.M.,
   type "5:01 PM" (without quotation marks) in the Deadline box.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then close System Agent.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To configure the shortcut for the MS-DOS-based program so that you are
warned before Windows 95 restarts in MS-DOS mode, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the shortcut, and then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Program tab.

<P><LI>Click Advanced.

<P><LI>Click the Warn Before Entering MS-DOS Mode check box to select it,
   and then click OK.
