The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you set up a computer to use the Microsoft File and Print Sharing for
NetWare service, you may see the following notification message on your
NetWare 4.x server console:
<P>
<PRE>   Server workgroup address has changed from
   000900000:0020af7438c4:5055 to
   000900000:00608cbbb2b1:0555

   Information came from router at 00608cbbb2b1

</PRE>NOTE: You may see different addresses from those listed above.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The File and Print Sharing for NetWare service broadcasts a SAP type of
0x67b or 0x67c to allow clients to browse the server. To the NetWare
server, this broadcast of the workgroup name appears as a server name.
<P>
When a new browse master is elected, the NIC address in the SAP broadcast
changes (reflecting the address of the NIC in the new browse master) and
the NetWare server displays a notification that the address of that server
has changed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Browse masters can be Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, or Windows NT
computers. Use the appropriate resolution for the computers on your
network.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95 Computers Only</h3>
 
<P>
Set one of the Windows 95 computers to be a dedicated browse master.
<P>
NOTE: If the computer that is acting as the browse master goes offline,
your network will lose browsing capabilities.
<P>
For computers using the File and Print Sharing for NetWare service, follow
these steps to force a computer to act as the browse master:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>Click the File and Print Sharing for NetWare service, and then
   click Properties.

<P><LI>Click Workgroup Advertising, and set the value to Enabled: Preferred
   Master.
<P>
</OL>To prevent a computer from acting as the browse master:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>Click the File and Print Sharing for NetWare service, and then
   click Properties.

<P><LI>Click Workgroup Advertising, and set the value to Enabled: Will Not Be
   Master.
<P>
</OL>For computers using the File and Print Sharing for Microsoft Networks
service, follow these steps to force a computer to act as the browse
master:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>Click the File and Print Sharing for Microsoft Networks service,
   and then click Properties.

<P><LI>Click Browse Master, and set the value to Enabled.
<P>
</OL>To prevent a computer from acting as the browse master:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>Click the File and Print Sharing for Microsoft Networks service,
   and then click Properties.

<P><LI>Click Browse Master, and set the value to Disabled.
<P>
</OL><h3>Windows 95 and Windows for Workgroup Computers</h3>
 
<P>
Set one of the Windows 95 computers as the browse master using the
instructions above.
<P>
To prevent a Windows for Workgroups computer from acting as the browse
master, edit the System.ini file in the Windows folder and add the
following line to the [Network] section of the file:
<P>
<PRE>   MaintainServerList=No

</PRE></OL><h3>Windows 95 and Windows NT Computers</h3>
 
<P>
Windows NT computers automatically become browse masters if they are
involved in an election. For this configuration, you need to disable the
browse master service on Windows 95 computers as described above.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95, Windows NT, and Windows for Workgroup Computers</h3>
 
<P>
Windows NT computers automatically win the election for browse master, so
you need to disable the browse master service on all other computers as
described above.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft suggests that computers using the File and Print Sharing for
NetWare service be members of the same workgroup. This decreases the number
of SAP broadcasts that are generated because only one SAP broadcast is
generated for each workgroup.
