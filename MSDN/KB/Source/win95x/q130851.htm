The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using an application that uses Remote Registry Services (such
as System Monitor) and you try to connect to a computer that does not exist
on the network, it may take several minutes before you receive a response
indicating that the remote computer cannot be located or connected to.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This situation can occur because Domain Name Service (DNS) resolution is
using User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to send name-resolution packets to the
DNS server, which is unreachable. When this occurs, the resolver times out
repeatedly, taking approximately one minute per attempt.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this situation, remove the TCP/IP protocol from the network
adapter or the dial-up adapter.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This situation can occur if you have the following configuration:

<UL><LI>A physical LAN connection.

<LI>Dial-Up Networking is installed.

<LI>The TCP/IP protocol is installed and is bound to both the network
   adapter and the Dial-Up Networking adapter.

<LI>The system is configured for Remote Registry Services.
<P></UL>
