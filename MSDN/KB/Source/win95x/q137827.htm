<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using user profiles and you log on to another workstation on
the network, your personal desktop icons and Start menu shortcuts appear,
but some of the programs associated with your shortcuts may not run. If
you can run a program, some or all of your custom settings for that
program may not appear.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When user profiles are enabled, your own personal configuration is used
when you log on to a computer on the network. This configuration includes
desktop icons and Start menu shortcuts, but does not include the actual
program files that are installed on your computer. If you create a
shortcut for a program installed on your computer, but that program is not
installed on the computer you log on to, you cannot run that program using
the shortcut.
<P>
If the program is installed on the computer you log on to, the program may
run, but your custom program settings may not appear. If the program
stores its custom settings in an initialization (.ini) file instead of the
Windows 95 registry, those custom settings are not available when you log
on to another computer on the network. Your personal configuration
includes the user portion of the registry (User.dat), but does not include
the .ini files found in the Windows folder or any other program folders.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you cannot run a program for which you have a desktop icon or Start
menu shortcut, install that program on the computer you are logged on to.
Install the program in the same folder as on your own computer.
<P>
If you can run a program, but your custom settings do not appear, change
the settings in the program to match your custom settings. Note that when
you do so, the custom settings you create will be used for everyone who
uses the program on this computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
User profiles contain configuration preferences and options for each user.
User profile settings include everything in the Hkey_Current_User section
of the registry, including the following items:

<UL><LI>Control Panel settings and preferences for the Windows 95 user
   interface, including settings for desktop layout, background, font
   selection, colors, and shortcuts on the desktop and Start menu.
<P>
   NOTE: For desktop icons and Start menu shortcuts to be included in user
   profiles, the "Include desktop icons and Network Neighborhood contents
   in user settings" and "Include Start menu and program groups in user
   settings" check boxes on the User Profiles tab must be selected. To
   access the User Profiles tab, double-click the Passwords icon in
   Control Panel.

<LI>Settings for persistent network connections and information about
   recently used resources, including documents, Find Computer results,
   installation locations, and printer ports.

<LI>Program settings (for programs that can write directly to the
   registry), including settings for the accessories and programs
   installed with Windows 95, menu and toolbar configurations, and fonts.
