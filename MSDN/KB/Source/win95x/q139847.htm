The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Dial-Up Networking to connect to a computer that is running
Windows 95 and the "File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks" network
service, you may be unable to use the NET command to browse or connect to
shared resources on that computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are met:

<UL><LI>Your computer and the computer that you connected to using Dial-Up
   Networking are not physically connected.

<LI>The computer you connected to is not running Novell NetWare.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this situation, use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Use Network Neighborhood to browse or connect to shared resources
   on the computer you connected to (instead of using the NET command).

<LI>Disconnect your computer from the network it is connected to.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If your computer and the computer you connected to using Dial-Up Networking
are physically connected, you do not need to use the Dial-Up Networking
connection to browse or connect to shared resources on that computer. When
you attempt to use the NET command, the LAN connection is used instead of
the Dial-Up Networking connection.
