The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article outlines self-help support options available for Windows 95
users.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Many of the self-help support options mentioned in the this article make
reference to the Microsoft Knowledge Base and the Microsoft Software
Library. Below is a brief description of each.
<P>
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
The Microsoft Knowledge Base is the same database that Microsoft Support
Engineers use to provide you with answers over the phone. The database
contains more than 50,000 detailed articles with technical information
about Microsoft products, bug and fix lists, documentation errors, and
answers to the most commonly asked technical support questions.
<P>
Microsoft Software Library:
<P>
The Microsoft Software Library contains hundreds of free software add-ons,
bug fixes, peripheral drivers, software updates, and programming aids.
Included in the library are two Windows 95 Help files called the Windows
95 Support Assistant, which contains information and troubleshooting advice
on pre-setup, setup, and networking, and the Hardware Compatibility List,
which lists all the PC systems and peripherals compatible with Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h3>Built-in Support</h3>
 
<P>
There are a variety of new and enhanced support tools built into Windows
95. These tools are designed to answer many of your questions on how to use
Windows 95.
<P>
Windows 95 Tour:
<P>
When you start Windows 95 you see the Welcome Screen, which contains a
Windows Tour button. Choosing this button launches a 10-minute interactive
tour that will save you time and quickly get you up and running with
Windows 95's new features.
<P>
Windows Help System:
<P>
You can find the answers to many of your questions about using Windows 95's
new features right on the Start button. The Windows 95 online Help system
is vastly improved over earlier versions and is much more task oriented.
The new Windows 95 online Help system has jumps that take you directly to
features being described and the Help window remains on the screen to
provide you a continual source of reference. The Windows 95 Help system
contains Wizards that direct you through such operations as installing
printers and establishing Dial-Up Networking connections. The new Help file
also contains troubleshooting guides and tips and tricks on how to use
Windows 95.
<P>
Question Mark Buttons:
<P>
Many dialog boxes in Windows 95 contain a question mark button that you can
use to get information about any item in the dialog box. When you click
this button, the cursor changes to a context help pointer. You can then
point to any item in the dialog box that you want information about and
click it. When you do, Windows 95 displays a detailed description of the
item.
<P>
Read Me Files:
<P>
When you install Windows 95, Setup copies several Read Me files to the
Windows 95 folder. These Read Me files contain complementary or late-
breaking information that supplements the Microsoft Windows 95
documentation.
<P>
Windows 95 Resource Kit:
<P>
An online version of the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit and some of the
tools included with the Resource Kit are included on the Windows 95 CD-ROM
(in the Admin\Reskit\Helpfile folder) and in the CD-ROM Extras for
Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade. The CD-ROM Extras for Microsoft Windows 95
Upgrade includes many files that are included in the CD-ROM version of
Windows 95, but not in the floppy disk version. If you have the floppy disk
version of Windows 95, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article for information about obtaining the CD-ROM Extras for Windows 95
Upgrade:

Application Compatibility List, the Hardware Compatibility List, and many
more.
<P>
Support Assistant is a no-cost tool developed by Microsoft's Product
Support Services (PSS) organization and the User Education group. Support
Assistant runs with Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, and Windows 95,
and contains the following content:

</UL>Windows 95 System Check is a tool that can be used to ensure that your
existing hardware meets the minimum requirements to run Windows 95. This
tool checks for processor type, hard disk space, RAM, and certain programs
that are known to cause problems during installation.

The Windows 95 Software Compatibility List (SCL) lists programs that
are compatible with Windows 95.
<P>
The Windows 95 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) contains a list of
computer systems and peripherals that are compatible with Windows 95.
The HCL lists products that meet the "Designed for Windows 95" logo
requirements, which include Plug and Play support and support for 32-bit
Windows 95 drivers. The HCL also lists products that are compatible with
Windows 95--products that have been tested and work with Windows 95, but
do not meet the logo requirements. Finally, the HCL makes clear which
device drivers are located on the Windows 95 disks, CD-ROM, or online
services.
