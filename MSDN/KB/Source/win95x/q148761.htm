</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1 is version 950a of Windows 95, provided
to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for preinstallation on
computers meant to be sold in the retail channel or to corporate
customers. This is not a new version of Windows 95. OEM Service Release 1
is Windows 95 with Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 and the fixes and
components included with Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1 included.
The updated and additional tools provided with Windows 95 Service Pack 1
are not included in OEM Service Release 1.
<P>
If you are able to determine that some of the fixes and components
included with Windows 95 Service Pack 1 are installed on a computer,
but you are not sure whether they were installed by Windows 95 Service
Pack 1 or OEM Service Release 1, double-click Add/Remove Programs in
Control Panel. If Windows 95 Service Pack 1 appears in the list of
installed programs, then the fixes and components were most likely
installed by Windows 95 Service Pack 1. If Windows 95 Service Pack 1 does
not appear in the list of installed programs, then they were most likely
installed by OEM Service Release 1.
<P>
NOTE: You can install Windows 95 Service Pack 1 over OEM Service Release
1. If you do so, the fixes and components are most recently installed by
Windows 95 Service Pack 1, but you are also running OEM Service Release 1.
In addition, note that the Tweak UI component of the Windows 95 Power Toys
can be used to remove Windows 95 Service Pack 1 from the list of installed
programs that appears when you double-click Add/Remove Programs in Control
Panel. If you do so, Windows 95 Service Pack 1 does not appear in the list
of installed programs even though the fixes and components were installed
by Windows 95 Service Pack 1.
<P>
OEM Service Release 1 is not available for download or purchase from
Microsoft by retail customers. All the functionality provided with OEM
Service Release 1 can be obtained by installing Windows 95 Service Pack 1.
For information about Windows 95 Service Pack 1, please see the following
