<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to troubleshoot problems related to the video
components of DirectX, which include DirectDraw and Direct3D. DirectX is
a suite of components that helps multimedia programs achieve higher
performance by accessing hardware features directly. DirectDraw is used
to directly access video adapter hardware. Direct3D is used to directly
access 3D rendering features built in to many video adapters.
<P>
DirectX may be installed by programs such as a game, or you can download
DirectX 5.0 as a separate component from the following Microsoft Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/download.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/directx/download.asp</A></B>

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Certification of DirectX Components</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft supports all certified DirectX drivers. If a driver is not
certified, contact your hardware manufacturer for support.

<OL><P><LI>To determine if your DirectX drivers are certified, run the
   Maintenance-Mode DirectX Setup program (Dxsetup.exe). If you installed
   DirectX 5, Dxsetup.exe is located by default in the Program
   Files\Directx folder. If it is not located in this folder, find the
   file. To do so, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.
<P>
   b. Type the following line in the Named box, and then click Find Now:
<P>
<PRE>         dxsetup.exe

   c. Double-click Dxsetup.exe.

</PRE></OL>NOTE: Some non-certified drivers may work with DirectX. It is not
necessary for the driver to be listed as certified to work with DirectX
programs.
<P>
DirectX Setup displays a list of DirectX core components, the version
number for each component, and whether the component is certified. For
more information about the Dxsetup.exe program, see the following articles
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<P><h3>DirectX Compatibility with Your Display Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Contact your hardware manufacturer to verify that the driver for your
display adapter is DirectX-compatible.
<P>
A list of the updated display adapter drivers for DirectX 1.0-5.0 is
available from Microsoft. For more information, see the following articles
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q158953.htm">Q158953</A></B>

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q175894.htm">Q175894</A></B>
   TITLE     : Video Adapter Drivers Included with DirectX 5

</PRE>For the most recent list of supported adapters for DirectX 5.0, see the
following Microsoft Web page:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/directx/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>Some display adapters may be compatible with either DirectDraw or Direct3D,
but not both.
<P>
<P><h3>Known Problems with DirectX and Your Display Adapter</h3>
 
<P>
When you attempt to install a program that uses DirectX, you may receive
error messages or experience display problems. Upgrade to the latest
display drivers and, if necessary, reinstall any programs that require
DirectX.
<P>
For more information, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q161406.htm">Q161406</A></B>
   TITLE     : Video Display Problem after Installing Program


</PRE>Contact your software manufacturer to determine if there are known issues
using DirectX with your adapter and their driver software. Microsoft
recommends upgrading to an updated driver if they have one available.

      TITLE     : Files Installed by DirectX 5.0

</PRE><P><LI>If you are using DirectX 5.0, you can also use DirectX Information
   (Dxinfo.exe) to determine which DirectX files are installed. Dxinfo.exe
   is located in the Program Files\Directx\Setup folder and lists each
   file installed with DirectX, including the file version number, file
   date, and file size. This information can also be saved as a text file.
   If the file is not located in this folder, look for the file. To do so,
   follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.
<P>
   b. In the Named box, type the following line, and then click Find Now:
<P>
<PRE>         dxinfo.exe

   c. Double click Dxinfo.exe.

</PRE><P><LI>If you have conflicting versions installed, rename any files from the
   older version of DirectX. To do so, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.
<P>
   b. In the Named box, type the following line, and then click Find Now
<P>
<PRE>         &lt;dxdriver&gt;

      where &lt;dxdriver&gt; is the name of one of the older DirectX drivers.

   c. Click a file, and then click Rename on the File menu.

   d. Type the name of the file as follows

         &lt;dxdriver&gt;.xxx

      where &lt;dxdriver&gt; is the name of the DirectX driver file.

   e. Repeat steps 1-2 for each older DirectX file.

   f. Reinstall the more recent version of DirectX.

   g. Test the DirectX program and verify that the problem no longer
      occurs.

   h. If the problem no longer occurs, click Start, point to Find, and
      then click Files Or Folders.

   i. In the Named box, type the following line, and then click Find Now

         &lt;dxdriver&gt;.xxx

      where &lt;dxdriver&gt; is the name of one of the renamed DirectX drivers.

   j. Click Delete on the File menu.

   k. Repeat steps I-J for each file renamed in steps C-E.

</PRE><P><LI>If you still experience problems, you may want to reinstall DirectX.
   You may receive the following error message attempting to reinstall
   DirectX:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Insert Disk
      The disk labeled 'DirectDraw Drivers' is now required
