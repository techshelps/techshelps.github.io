The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using a computer with an ESS Technology ES1688 AudioDrive
sound card, sound may not work correctly, or may cause programs to stop
responding (hang). In Windows 95, Device Manager may report a problem with
the device, or that the device is not working correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The ESS AudioDrive device that exhibits this problem is an onboard chip
that is soldered to the motherboard. Early versions of the driver for this
device cannot reserve physical RAM, and allow the driver to be paged out
of virtual memory. The device is not capable of using virtual memory.
<P>
Although Windows 95 correctly identifies the sound card as an ESS
Technology ES1688 AudioDrive sound card, the Windows 95 driver does not
work correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Remove the ES1688 sound card driver and replace it with the ESS ES688
   sound card driver. To do so, follow these steps:
