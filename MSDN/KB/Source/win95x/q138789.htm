The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists the steps to configure Windows 95 to connect to the
Internet using Dial-Up Networking. Please read the entire article before
you start configuring Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 has built-in support for connecting to an Internet provider
using a PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) or SLIP (Serial Line Internet
Protocol) account. SLIP support is available with the CD-ROM version of
Windows 95, the CD-ROM Extras for Windows 95 upgrade, and the Internet
Jumpstart Kit component of Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h3>Getting Started</h3>
 
<P>
To connect to the Internet, you need a PPP or SLIP account with an Internet
provider. You also need the following information from your Internet
service provider:

<UL><LI>User name
<LI>Password
<LI>Local access phone number
<LI>Your host and domain name
<LI>DNS server IP address
<LI>Authentication technique (whether or not a terminal window is used)
<P>
</UL>Your Internet service provider may also supply you with an IP address and
an IP subnet mask. These optional items are needed only if your provider
gives you a dedicated IP address to use every time you dial in.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Set Up Dial-Up Networking</h3>
 
<P>
Before you set up your Internet connection, make sure Dial-Up Networking is
installed. To do so, click the Start button, point to Programs, point to
Accessories, and see if a folder called Dial-Up Networking is available.
<P>
If you have a Dial-Up Networking folder, go to the "How to Install the
TCP/IP Protocol" section below.
<P>
If you do not have a Dial-Up Networking folder, add Dial-Up Networking by
following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

<P><LI>On the Windows Setup tab, click Communications (do not click the check
   box), and then click Details.

<P><LI>Click the Dial-Up Networking check box to select it, and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the Windows Setup tab, click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: SLIP is included in the Admin\Apptools\Dscript folder on the Windows
95 CD-ROM. If you are using the floppy disk version of Windows 95 and want
to use SLIP support, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base for information about the availability of SLIP:

   TITLE     : CD-ROM Extras for Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade

</PRE></OL>If you plan to use a SLIP account to connect to an Internet service
provider, perform the following steps to install SLIP support:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

<P><LI>On the Windows Setup tab, click Have Disk.

<P><LI>Insert the appropriate disk or CD-ROM, and then point to the folder
   that contains SLIP.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Install the TCP/IP Protocol</h3>
 
<P>
Once Dial-Up Networking is installed, follow these steps to install the
TCP/IP protocol:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon.

<P><LI>On the Configuration tab, click Add, click Protocol, click Add, click
   Microsoft in the Manufacturers box, click TCP/IP in the Network
   Protocols box, and then click OK.

<P><LI>If you want to connect only to the Internet, you need only the
   following network components:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Client for Microsoft Networks
      Dial-Up Adapter
      TCP/IP
</PRE><P>
   To remove a component, click the component, and then click Remove.
<P>
   NOTE: You can have additional protocols bound to the dial-up adapter if
   you need them for connection to other Dial-Up Networking servers.

<P><LI>Once the necessary components are installed, click OK, and then restart
   your computer when you are prompted to do so.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You do not need to configure any TCP/IP settings at this time.
Instructions for configuring these settings is included later in this
article. The default TCP/IP settings are as follows:

<UL><LI>IP address set to Obtain An IP Address Automatically
<LI>WINS Configuration set to Use DHCP For WINS Resolution
<LI>Installed Gateways: None
<LI>DNS Configuration set to Disable DNS
<P>
</UL><h3>How to Create and Configure a New Connection for PPP Accounts</h3>

   earlier, a terminal window appears in which you enter your login
   information. After you enter your user name and password, click
   Continue. The order in which you log in and the information you have to
   provide may vary for your Internet service provider. Please contact
   your provider if you have any questions about the login procedure.
<P>
</OL>After the Connected To dialog box appears, you are connected to the
Internet.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Create and Configure a New Connection for SLIP Accounts</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: If you do not have a SLIP account, you do not need to perform the
steps in this section.

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and
   then click Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>If this is the first time you have used Dial-Up Networking, the Welcome
   To Dial-Up Networking Wizard appears. If the wizard does not appear,
   double-click Make New Connection and follow the instructions for

<P><LI>Once the connection is created, an icon appears in the Dial-Up
   Networking folder that you can double-click to connect to the Internet.

<P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the newly created icon in the
   Dial-Up Networking folder, and then click Properties on the menu
   that appears.

<P><LI>On the General tab, click Server Type.

<P><LI>Click SLIP: UNIX Connection in the Type Of Dial-Up Server box, and then
   click the TCP/IP check box in the Allowed Network Protocols area to
   select it. The TCP/IP selection allows for a quicker connect time after
   dialing your Internet service provider. The other options are not
   relevant to connecting to the Internet.
<P>
   NOTE: If you have a CSLIP (compressed SLIP) account, click "CSLIP: UNIX
   Connection with IP Header Compression." Your Internet service provider
   can tell you which type of SLIP account you have.

<P><LI>Click TCP/IP Settings.
<P>
   To use resources on the Internet you must enter your DNS server
   address. You can also enter your IP address if your Internet
   service provider supplied you with a fixed IP address.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Connect to Your SLIP Account</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and
   then click Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Double-click the icon you created earlier. In the Connect To dialog
   box, click Connect.

<P><LI>After modem negotiation, a terminal window appears in which you enter
   your login information. After you enter your user name and password in
   the terminal window, you should receive a message from your Internet
   service provider informing you of your IP address for the session. Most
   providers use a message such as "Your IP address is" or "SLIP session
   from ###.###.###.### to ###.###.###.###" where the second set of
   numbers is your IP address.
<P>
   The order in which you log in and the information you have to provide
   may vary for your Internet service provider. Please contact your
   provider if you have any questions about the login procedure.

<P><LI>Make a note of your IP address, and then click Continue.

<P><LI>Confirm your IP address in the SLIP Connection IP Address dialog box by
   entering the IP address noted in step 4, and then click OK.
<P>
   If you are not sure what your IP address is, please contact your
   Internet provider and ask how to determine your IP address for your
   SLIP account.
<P>
</OL><h3>Advantages of PPP Over SLIP</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a SLIP account, you may want to investigate the possibility of
obtaining a PPP account. PPP accounts are faster, offer error correction,
may not require you to use the terminal window to log in, and do not
require you to manually enter your IP address.
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting Tips</h3>
 
<P>
If you experience problems connecting to the Internet:

<UL><LI>Make sure your server type is correct. For example, if you have a PPP
   account, make sure the server type is set to PPP, not SLIP or CSLIP.

<LI>If you have a SLIP account, make sure you enter the correct IP address
   when you are prompted to do so during the login process.
<P>
</UL>If you experience problems after you connect to the Internet:

<UL><LI>If you use a SLIP account and you can successfully ping another
   computer but you cannot use Winsock programs to connect to Internet
   resources, change the server type from SLIP to CSLIP (or from CSLIP
   to SLIP).
<P>
</UL>To make sure your Internet connection is working properly, ping a known IP
address by typing the following command at an MS-DOS prompt
<P>
<PRE>   ping &lt;IP address&gt;

</PRE></OL>where &lt;IP address&gt; is a known IP address such as the Microsoft FTP server
(198.105.232.1).
<P>
If you can ping a known IP address successfully, basic TCP/IP connectivity
is functioning properly. Next, try to ping the Microsoft FTP server using
"ftp.microsoft.com" instead of its IP address. To do so, type the following
command at an MS-DOS prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   ping ftp.microsoft.com

</PRE>If this works, your DNS settings are functioning properly.
<P>
<P><h3>Glossary</h3>
 
<P>
Domain Name Service (DNS):
<P>
Sometimes referred to as the BIND service in BSD UNIX; a static,
hierarchical name service for TCP/IP hosts. A DNS server maintains a
database for resolving host names and IP addresses, allowing users of
computers configured to query the DNS to specify remote computers by host
names rather than IP addresses. DNS domains should not be confused with
Windows NT networking domains.
<P>
For example, issuing the "ping ftp.microsoft.com" command goes to the DNS
server you specified, looks up the IP address for the site, and then pings
that IP address.
<P>
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP):
<P>
An industry standard that is part of Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking to
ensure interoperability with remote access software from other vendors. It
allows you to use the IPX, TCP/IP, and NetBEUI protocols over a standard
telephone line connection.
<P>
Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP):
<P>
Another industry standard that is part of Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking to
ensure interoperability with remote access software from other vendors.
Unlike PPP, SLIP works with only one protocol. Windows 95 works with TCP/IP
over a standard telephone line connection.
<P>
Password Authentication Protocol (PAP):
<P>
This is an authentication method that can be used when connecting to an
Internet service provider. It allows you to log in without having to use a
terminal window. Using PAP, passwords are sent over the circuit in text
format, which offers no protection from playback.
<P>
Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP):
<P>
This is another authentication method that can be used when connecting to
an Internet service provider. It also allows you to log in without having
to use a terminal window. However, it does not send passwords in text
format and is more secure than PAP.
<P>
