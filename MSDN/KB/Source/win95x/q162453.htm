The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release version 2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to reinstall an OEM version of Windows 95, you may
receive one of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>INVALID PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION NUMBER
   The number you entered is not valid. Please make sure you typed the
   correct number of digits, including dashes if appropriate.

<LI>CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY
   The Certificate of Authenticity number you entered is not valid.
   Number entered  :  &lt;number you entered&gt;
   You cannot complete Setup without it. To return to the previous screen
   and retype the number, click on the re-enter button.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You did not enter the product ID correctly, or the product ID originally
entered on the computer does not match the number being entered.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>You Did Not Correctly Enter the Product ID</h3>
 
<P>
You need to type the OEM Product ID number from the Certificate of
Authenticity correctly. This number can be found on the front of the
Windows 95 booklet included with your PC. Enter the number as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   xxxxx-OEM-xxxxxxx-xxxxx

</PRE>The Certificate of Authenticity is your assurance that the software you
purchased with your computer system is legally licensed from Microsoft. If
you have any concerns regarding the legitimacy of your Certificate of
Authenticity (or if you do not have one), call the Microsoft Piracy
Hotline 1-800-RU-Legit (in the United States or Canada), or contact your
local Microsoft Subsidiary.
<P>
<P><h3>Product ID Number Does Not Match</h3>
 
<P>
When your computer was manufactured, your manufacturer entered a
Certificate of Authenticity number other than the one that is printed on
your Certificate of Authenticity. Therefore, the numbers do not match and
the software cannot be reinstalled.
<P>
They only way to solve this is to enter the number that the manufacturer
used instead of the one that is printed on your Certificate of
Authenticity. You should be able to start Windows 95 in Safe mode in order
to find the original number. In Windows 95, use the right mouse button to
click My Computer, and then click Properties on the menu that appears. The
number you should enter should be listed. If you can no longer access
Windows 95, you should contact your computer's manufacturer for more
information.
