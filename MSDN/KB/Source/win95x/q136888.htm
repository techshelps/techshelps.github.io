<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to play the game FreeCell using the numeric
keypad instead of a mouse.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
FreeCell starts with eight columns of cards.  There are four free cells and
four home cells. To move a card using a mouse, you select a card with the
mouse and then click the destination for the card.
<P>
To move a card using the numeric keypad, press the number of the column to
select the card. When you do so, the last card in the column is selected.
To move the card, press the number of the column to which you want to move
the card.
<P>
For example, if you had a red jack on the top of the fourth column and
wanted to move it to the black queen on the sixth column, you could follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Press 4 to select the jack.

<P><LI>Press 6 to play the jack on the queen.
<P>
</OL>To move a card to the free cell, select the card you want to move and then
press 0 on the numeric keypad. You can also press 0 when no card is
selected to choose a card in the free cell that you want to send back into
the game.
<P>
To move a card into the home column, select the card and press 9. Once you
move a card into the home column, the only way to retrieve the card is by
clicking the Undo command. You can do this only if you have made no other
plays since you moved the card to the home column.
<P>
If you try to move more than one card into an empty column, you are
prompted to move either the top card only or the entire column.
<P>
If you select a card and then decide not to move it, you can deselect the
card by pressing the column number again.
<P>
To see a card that is partially hidden by another card, press the card's
column number twice. When you do so, FreeCell displays all the cards in the
column slowly.
