The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>The Microsoft Network version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following Windows 95 tools place the number "1" at the beginning of a
number to be dialed if the number has a different area code than your
default area code:

<UL><LI>HyperTerminal
<LI>Dial-Up Networking
<LI>Phone Dialer
<LI>The Microsoft Network
<P>
</UL>Some countries (Canada, for example) have telephone numbers that are in
different area codes but that are not long distance calls.
<P>
This situation also occurs in some areas of the United States as well. For
example, in Maryland, area codes 301 and 202 are in the same region.
Callers in the region can make calls to either area code as a local call.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 is designed to add a preceding "1" before a telephone number
that has a different area code than your default area code so that you do
not need to add it manually.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>HyperTerminal</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps enable HyperTerminal to dial a telephone number with a
different area code as a local number:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click Accessories.

<P><LI>Click HyperTerminal Connections.

<P><LI>Double-click the icon that was created when you made a new HyperTerminal
   connection.

<P><LI>In the Dial dialog box, click the Modify button beside the phone number.

<P><LI>Click the Phone Number tab, then change the area code to match your
   local area code.

<P><LI>Type the phone number you want to dial, including the area code,
   in the Phone Number box.
<P>
   NOTE: You can skip the above steps by entering your local area code
   in the area code field, and by typing the telephone number you want
   to dial, including the area code, when you first create the connection.
<P>
</OL>Example:
<P>
In this example, the local area code is 555 and the number to the Microsoft
Download Service (MSDL) is (425) 936-6735; however, it is not a long
distance call. Because the area codes are different, Windows 95 dials the
number as a long distance number, 1-425-936-6735. To change this behavior,
double-click the HyperTerminal connection called Microsoft Download Service
and type "555" (without the quotation marks) in the Area code field. Now
type "425-936-6735" (without the quotation marks) in the Phone number
field. When you dial the number, only (425) 936-6735 is dialed because the
area code field matches your local area code field.
<P>
<P><h3>Dial-Up Networking</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps enable Dial-Up Networking to dial a telephone number
with a different area code as a local number:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click Accessories.

<P><LI>Click Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Double-click the icon that was created when you made a new Dial-Up
   Networking connection.

<P><LI>On the Connect To dialog box, remove the "1" from the phone number
   field.
<P>
   NOTE: This must be done each time you attempt to connect.
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>Click the Start button on the taskbar.

<P><LI>On the Programs menu, click Accessories, then click Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Click the icon that was created when you made a new Dial-Up Networking
   connection with the right (secondary) mouse button, then click
   Properties.

<P><LI>On the General tab, change the area code to match your local area
   code.

<P><LI>Type the phone number you want to dial, including the area code,
   in the Telephone Number box.
<P>
   NOTE: You can skip the above steps by entering your local area code
   in the area code field, and by typing the telephone number you want
   to dial, including the area code, when you first create the
   connection.
<P>
</OL>Example:
<P>
In this example, the local area code is 555, and the number to ANYBODY'S
Dial-Up Networking server is (425) 999-9999; however, it is not a long
distance call. Because the area codes are different, Windows 95 dials the
number as a long distance number, 1-425-999-9999. To change this behavior,
use the right (secondary) mouse button to click the icon called ANYBODY'S
Dial-Up Networking Server, then click Properties. Type "555" (without the
quotation marks) in the Area code field. Now type "425-936-6735" (without
the quotation marks) in the Telephone Number field. When you dial the
number, only (425) 999-9999 is dialed because the area code field matches
your local area code field.
<P>
<P><h3>Phone Dialer</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps enable Phone Dialer to dial a telephone number with a
different area code as a local number:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click Accessories.

<P><LI>Click Phone Dialer.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Dialing Properties, then click New.

<P><LI>Enter a new location. For example, TEST.

<P><LI>For the TEST location, enter the area code for the number you want
   to dial, then click OK. For example, 555.

<P><LI>Type the number you want to dial in the Number To Dial field.
<P>
   NOTE: Remember to change locations when necessary for each call you
   make.
<P>
</OL>Example:
<P>
In this example, the local area code is 555, and the number to the local
pizza delivery is (425) 999-9999; however, it is not a long distance call.
Because the area codes are different, Windows 95 dials the number as a long
distance number, 1-425-999-9999. To change this behavior, open Phone Dialer
and click Dialing Properties on the Tools menu. Create a new location
called TEST by clicking the New button, and then enter the area code of the
number you want to dial. In this scenario, the area code is 425. When you
want to dial a number with an area code of 425, choose the TEST location
and type the number to be dialed.
<P>
<P><h3>The Microsoft Network</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps enable The Microsoft Network to dial a telephone number
with a different area code as a local number:

<OL><P><LI>On the Sign In screen for The Microsoft Network, click the Settings
   button.

<P><LI>Click the Access Numbers button.

<P><LI>In both the Primary and Backup boxes, delete "+1" from the beginning
   of the access number.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>When you click the Connect button, the access number will be dialed as a
local call.
<P>
NOTE: You can change the primary and backup access numbers while you are
signing up for The Microsoft Network the first time.
