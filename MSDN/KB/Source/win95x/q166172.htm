The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to swap your current primary boot hard disk
(usually drive C) with a different hard disk and retain your current
files and system configuration in the process. This primarily involves
installing Windows 95 on a new hard disk and ensuring proper
identification of the new hardware. This process uses Microsoft Backup to
back up and restore files and configuration and registry settings.
<P>
Note that the method described in this article cannot be used to copy 
Windows 95 installations to multiple computers. Microsoft only supports 
the use of the standard Setup procedure as described in the Windows 95 
product documentation for each computer on which Windows 95 is installed.
<P>
WARNING: Before proceeding, fully review this article. Because of the
many steps involved, use this article only if you feel you have
sufficient experience to correctly perform all required steps. If not,
the safest approach is to back up your data files, run Windows 95 Setup
on your new hard disk, reinstall all of your programs from original
program CD-ROMs or disks, and then restore your data from backup.
<P>
If after reviewing this article you choose to proceed, carefully execute
each set of steps as written.
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article applies only to the replacement of the hard disk.
Do not use this article if other hardware changes are being made.
Improper use of this article can result in the loss of all data on your
hard disk. Microsoft is responsible only for the information pertaining
to Microsoft software installation detailed in this article. For correct
procedures and safeguards when handling hardware, refer to the
documentation included with your hardware, or contact your hardware
vendor. Improper handling of hardware can be dangerous and can cause
permanent damage to your computer. If you are unsure how to handle
hardware, we recommend that you have a factory-qualified hardware
technician perform the upgrade.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The WARNING designation is placed before procedures in which a mistake
   in following instructions can cause serious data loss. At these
   points, verify that you have properly followed the directions.

<LI>The information in this article applies only when Windows 95 is the
   primary operating system running on a standard MS-DOS partition.
   Windows 95 Backup cannot read files from non-MS-DOS partitions. A new
   installation of Windows 95 overwrites the Windows NT boot sector on
   computers configured to dual boot Windows NT, disabling the ability to
   start Windows NT.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Disks and Information Required</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Windows 95 Startup disk.
<P>
   To create a Startup Disk, follow these steps:
<P>
   1. In Control Panel, click Add/Remove Programs.
<P>
   2. On the Startup Disk tab, click Create Disk.

<LI>Proof of ownership of the previous operating system.
<P>
   You will need disk 1 of the disk set on which one of the previous
   operating systems was distributed:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows version 3.x
    - Microsoft Windows NT version 3.x or later
    - OS/2
</PRE><P>
   If you are reinstalling the full retail version of Windows 95 or
   Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2), proof of ownership of a
   previous operating system is not required.

<LI>CD-ROM driver installation disk.
<P>
   This disk must contain the MS-DOS-level drivers supplied by your
   hardware manufacturer. This applies only if you have the CD-ROM
   Upgrade version of Windows 95.

<LI>Complete set of Windows 95 Setup disks (if you are reinstalling
   Windows 95 from floppy disks).
<P>

   not have a vendor-supplied Windows 95 CD-ROM or disks, refer to the
   literature that came with your computer for instructions on obtaining
   the software.

<LI>The name of the folder in which Windows 95 is currently installed
   (typically C:\Windows).
<P>
</UL><h3>Choosing a Backup Method</h3>
 
<P>
The procedures outlined in this article require Microsoft Backup, which
is supplied with Windows 95. If Backup is not currently installed, see
the instructions in the "Installing Windows 95 on Your New Hard Disk"
section below.
<P>
Each of the following methods uses different hardware. Choose one of the
following two methods:

<UL><LI>Windows 95 Backup with a compatible tape backup hardware device
   attached to your computer. See the instructions in the "Method 1"
   section below.

<LI>Windows 95 Backup using both the original and new hard disks attached
   to the computer at the same time. See the instructions in the "Method
   2" section below.
<P>
</UL><h3>Method 1: Using Backup with a Tape Drive</h3>
 
<P>
This method requires compatible tape drive hardware. For more
information, start Microsoft Backup from the System Tools menu, click
Help, and refer to the "Tape drives that are compatible with Backup"
topic.
<P>
WARNING: When you are using Backup as described below, manually selecting
drive C instead of using the Full System Backup set does not back up
vital parts of your system (such as registry files). If you do not see
the following message after Step 5 in the following procedure, you have
not performed these steps correctly and you will need to restart the
process:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Backup is now making a copy of the settings in your system
   registry. This will take a few minutes.

</PRE>Before starting Backup, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In My Computer, click Options on the View menu.

<P><LI>On the View tab, make sure the Show All Files option is enabled.

<P><LI>Rename the following files:
<P>
<PRE>      File           New name
      ---------------------------
      System.1st     System.1sx
      Suhdlog.dat    Suhdlog.dax
      Setuplog.txt   Setuplog.txx
      Detlog.txt     Detlog.txx
      Bootlog.txt    Bootlog.txx

   NOTE: These files must be renamed, not copied.

</PRE></OL>After you follow steps 1-3 above, use the following steps to back up your
hard disk:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point
   to System Tools, and then click Backup.

<P><LI>Click OK to close preliminary informational dialog boxes.

<P><LI>Click the Backup tab.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open File Set.

<P><LI>Click Full System Backup, and then click Open.

   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q130946.htm">Q130946</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Troubleshooting Windows 95 Backup

</PRE><P><LI>Type a name for the backup set, and then click OK. Record the name for
   later use.
<P>
</OL>When Backup is finished backing up your files, click OK to close the
program, then perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Shut down Windows 95 and turn off your computer.

<P><LI>Detach the original hard disk from your computer, then attach the new
   hard disk in its place.
<P>
   For hardware setup and configuration information, see the
   documentation included with your hardware or contact your hardware
   vendor.

<P><LI>When the new hard disk is set up correctly, go to the "Preparing Your
   New Hard Disk" section below.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Using Backup with Your New Hard Disk</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Do not use method 2 if your computer requires disk overlay
software to access your hard disks.
<P>
Before starting Backup, calculate the estimated minimum disk space
required on your new hard disk as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   (total space in use on current hard disk) + ((total space in use on
   current hard disk) * 0.66)

</PRE></OL>For example, if your current hard disk has 400 MB total used space, the
estimated minimum disk space required on the new disk would be:
<P>
<PRE>   400 MB + (400 MB * 0.66) = 664 MB

</PRE>The result equals the approximate size of a full system backup. The ratio
(in this case 3:2) is only an estimate and varies from drive to drive
depending on the file types being backed up.
<P>
The new hard disk must have at least the estimated minimum disk space
available.
<P>
If your current hard disk is compressed, substitute 1.0 for 0.66 in your
calculation. In the example above, the required space would become 800
MB.
<P>
If you have inadequate storage space on your new hard disk and you cannot
remove any files or data, use method 1 instead. Note that the Temporary
Internet Files folder may contain files that can be safely removed.
<P>
Install the New Hard Disk as a Secondary Drive:
<P>
Before running Backup, you need to install and configure your new hard
disk. For information about how to install and configure your hardware,
refer to the documentation that came with your hard disk or contact your
hardware vendor.
<P>
After your new hard disk is configured, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Follow the instructions in the "Preparing Your New Hard Disk Using
   FDISK and FORMAT" section below.

<P><LI>When formatting is finished, follow the Backup instructions in the
   "Method 1" section above. Modify the instructions in step 6 to back up
   your files to the new hard disk (usually drive D).

<P><LI>When Backup is finished, shut down Windows 95, turn off your computer,
   and remove the original hard disk from the computer, leaving the new
   disk in place.

<P><LI>Boot with the Windows 95 Startup disk.

<P><LI>Run FDISK to set the primary partition on the new disk as the active
   partition. For information about using FDISK, see the following
   section.

<P><LI>Restart your computer to a command prompt.

<P><LI>Proceed to the "Installing Windows 95 on Your New Hard Disk" section
   below.
<P>
</OL><h3>Preparing Your New Hard Disk Using FDISK and FORMAT</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: If your computer requires disk overlay software to access your
hard disks, apply FDISK and FORMAT as described below only if advised to
do so in the documentation provided by your overlay software manufacturer.
The installation of the overlay software may provide functionality equal
to that described in this section.
<P>
Most new hard disks have not been partitioned or formatted. If your new
hard disk requires this basic configuration, use the following tools to
prepare it for file installation.
<P>
Partition Your New Hard Disk with FDISK:
<P>
WARNING: Before proceeding, verify that the disk you are about to
partition is the new hard disk and contains no important data. If you
are unsure, stop immediately.
<P>
For information about using FDISK to partition your hard disk, see the
"Repartitioning Your Hard Disk" section in following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
