<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you dock or undock your computer it no longer operates properly.
For example, your keyboard or mouse stops working.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Your computer does not have a Plug and Play BIOS. Your computer must have a
Plug and Play BIOS to support hot or warm docking and undocking.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You must turn your computer off before you dock or undock it if the
computer does not have a Plug and Play BIOS. You may want to contact
your computer's manufacturer about upgrading the BIOS to a Plug and Play
version.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Hot docking and undocking refers to inserting the computer in the docking
station or removing it from the docking station while the computer is
running at full power. Warm docking refers to docking or undocking the
computer while it is in suspended mode. Laptop or portable computers with a
Plug and Play BIOS can be hot or warm docked and undocked.
<P>
Some computer manufacturers will not supply a Plug and Play BIOS for
certain computer models. For example, Toshiba has stated that it will not
provide a Plug and Play BIOS for T4600 laptop computers.
