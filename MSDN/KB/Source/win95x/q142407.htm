The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you add the CompuServe address book to the list of available address
books in Microsoft Exchange and then try to use a name from the CompuServe
address book when you compose a new message, Microsoft Exchange may not
recognize the name. When you click Check Names or send the message, you may
be prompted to create a new address for the name or to choose a different
name from the available address books.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>When the Check Names dialog box appears, choose the name you want from
   the list of names in the CompuServe address book. To do so, click Show
   More Names, click CompuServe Address Book in the list of available
   address books, click the name you want, and then click OK.

<LI>Before you click Check Names or try to send the message, select the
   name you want in the CompuServe address book. To do so, click the To
   button, click CompuServe Address Book in the list of available address
   books, click the name you want, and then click OK.

<LI>Before you compose the new message, add the name you want from the
   CompuServe address book to your personal address book, which is
   automatically checked each time you send a message. To do so, click
   Address Book on the Tools menu, click CompuServe Address Book in the
   list of address books, double-click the name you want, click Personal
   Address Book, and then click OK.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The CompuServe address book is not added to the list of available address
books in Microsoft Exchange by default. To add the CompuServe address book,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Add the CompuServe Mail information service to your current Microsoft
   Exchange profile. To do so, double-click the Setup.exe file in the
   Drivers\Other\Exchange\Compusrv folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. When
   you are prompted to add CompuServe Mail for Microsoft Exchange to your
   default profile, click Yes. When you are prompted for the location of
   the common CompuServe folder, select the folder in which the Compu-
   Serve files are located (if you have a CompuServe information manager
   installed on your computer). If you do not have a CompuServe
   information manager installed on your computer, accept the default
   folder selected by Windows 95.
<P>
   NOTE: The CompuServe Mail information service is included in the CD-ROM
   version of Windows 95, but not in the floppy disk version. To use the
   CompuServe Mail information service, you must have the CD-ROM version
   of Windows 95.

<P><LI>Double-click the Inbox icon on the desktop to start Microsoft Exchange.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Addressing tab.

<P><LI>Click Add, click CompuServe Address Book, click Add, and then click
   Close.
<P>
</OL>The CompuServe address book is stored in a file called Addrbook.dat. When
you are using a CompuServe information manager, such as WinCIM, this file
is located in the &lt;cserve&gt;\Support folder, where &lt;cserve&gt; is the folder
containing the CompuServe information manager. If you are not using a
CompuServe information manager, this file is created by Windows 95.
<P>
When you add a new address after you install the CompuServe address book,
you must specify whether the address should be added to the CompuServe
address book or the Microsoft Exchange personal address book. When you add
an address to the CompuServe address book, the address is added to the
Addrbook.dat file, not the Microsoft Exchange personal address book (.pab)
file.
