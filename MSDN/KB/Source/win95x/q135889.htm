<P><h2>Client for NetWare</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95 and NetWare 3.12 and 4.01 Servers</h3>
 
Windows 95 with Microsoft Client for NetWare can experience problems
with NetWare 3.12 and 4.01 servers if packet burst is turned on.
This is a known problem with these servers that Novell has fixed and
posted on their forums.  Download the file Pburst.exe from the Novell
Netwire Forum on Compuserve or the Novell Web site (Ftp.Novell.com).
Pburst.exe contains the patch for the affected servers.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Opening Files on NetWare 3.11 Servers</h3>
 
Programs that open a large number of files consecutively in rapid
succession may have occasional problems opening files on NetWare 3.11
servers. This can also happen when opening a file in a folder for
which you do not have file scan rights, such as an MS Mail shared post
office.
<P>
Possible error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   - "File not found" error on a file you know exists
   - "Sharing violation" or "Lock violation" error
   - "Unable to open file" error
   - "File in use" error

</PRE>There are two solutions to these problems:
<P>
<PRE>  -- Obtain a patch file from Novell for the NetWare 3.11 server.
     Using ftp, connect to ftp.novell.com. Go to
     /pub/netware/nwos/nw311/osnlm and run 311ptd.exe. This program
     will extract the file os2opnfx.nlm. Then, load the .nlm file
     onto the NetWare 3.11 server. ("load os2opnfx.nlm")

  -- Disable long filename support in Client for NetWare. This means
     that you will not be able to use long filenames on any NetWare
     servers from Windows 95. To disable long-filename support:

        Run REGEDIT, and then go to

</PRE>HKEY_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\NWRedir
<P>
Create a new binary value whose name is supportLFN and whose
value is 0.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Lowercase Extended-Character Passwords on NetWare 4.1 Servers</h3>
 
In a NetWare 4.1 environment, Client for NetWare does not support
passwords that use certain lowercase extended characters. Users need
to change their password to all uppercase characters.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Client for NetWare and Programs That Use External Files</h3>
 
If you are using Microsoft Client for NetWare, and you run a program
that needs to access an auxiliary file, your program will have
problems if the auxiliary file is on a drive other than the one the
program is on. This is because only the current drive is searched for
auxiliary files; the search path is not searched. If you experience
this problem, make sure the program and any auxiliary files are on the
same drive.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Novell NetWare Login Scripts</h3>
 
The Login Script Processor for the Microsoft Client for NetWare should
correctly process all commands in your login scripts.  However, you
cannot load memory-resident programs (TSRs) from these scripts.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Plug and Play Network Cards and 16-Bit Real-Mode Drivers</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the 16-bit real-mode driver for your Plug and Play
network interface card (NIC), your Plug and Play card may appear not
to function.
<P>
The reason the card appears to malfunction is that on most computers,
the Plug and Play card is inactive until Windows 95 enables it. 16-bit
NIC drivers load before Windows 95 can turn on Plug and Play cards.
Some 16-bit NIC drivers do not recognize Plug and Play cards (most
NE2000 Plug and Play clones fall into this category). In this case,
follow these steps to use your Plug and Play card with a 16-bit NIC
driver:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Softset utility that comes with your Plug and Play card,
   and then set the card to non-Plug and Play mode.
</OL>2. Remove the network card from the list of devices in the Device
<PRE>   Manager listing: In Control Panel, double-click the System icon,
   click the Device Manager tab, select the network card, and then
   click Remove.
</PRE></OL>3. Reinstall the network card using the Add New Hardware icon in
<PRE>   Control Panel.

</PRE>When you install a 32-bit protect mode NIC driver in the future, you
can rerun Softset to turn on Plug and Play mode for your card. This
problem does not happen if you are using a 32-bit protect-mode NIC
driver.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Intel EtherExpress 16 NICs and PCI Computers</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using an Intel EtherExpress 16-network interface card (NIC)
in a PCI computer that has a Diamond Speed Star PCI video card, your
system may hang or not initialize properly. These problems, according
to Intel customer support, are not related to Windows 95 and happen
on a variety of operating systems.
<P>
If you have one of the following video cards, contact your vendor to
obtain a new video BIOS update:
<P>
<PRE>   * Diamond Speed Star PCI video card with BIOS version 1.01
   * Diamond Viper PCI VGA Video Adapter
   * Diamond Stealth video card, BIOS v1.03

</PRE>Other PCI video cards might also cause problems with this Intel NIC.
In general, if you experience problems with your EtherExpress 16 in a
PCI computer other than those described above, please replace the card
before reporting the problem to Microsoft.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Windows for Workgroup Shares</h2>
 
<P>
When you upgrade to Windows 95 from Windows for Workgroups, your
shares are not maintained. The folders/directories you shared in
Windows for Workgroups need to be reshared.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Running Windows 95 from a Server</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 can be set up to run from a network server. The Windows 95
Resource Kit contains complete instructions for installing Windows
in this environment (see Chapter 4, "Server Based Setup for Windows
95").
<P>
The following configurations are supported:
<P>
<PRE> -- Booting from hard disk using:
      Client for Microsoft Networks
      Client for NetWare Networks
      Novell Workstation Shell 3.x (NETX)
      Novell Workstation Shell 4.x (VLM)
      Banyan VINES DOS/Windows client

 -- Booting from a floppy disk using:
      Client for Microsoft Networks
      Client for NetWare Networks
      Novell Workstation Shell 3.x (NETX)
      Novell Workstation Shell 4.x (VLM)
      Banyan VINES DOS/Windows client

 -- Booting from a remote boot server using:
      Client for NetWare Networks
      Novell Workstation Shell 3.x (NETX)
      Novell Workstation Shell 4.x (VLM)

</PRE>To use one of the Microsoft clients, your network card must have both
an NDIS2 (16-bit real mode) *AND* an NDIS3 (32-bit protect mode)
driver. If your network card is a PCI, EISA, or ISAPNP card, you must
run Windows over a real-mode client.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>To Install Windows 95 over Previous Builds</h3>
 
To install this final version of Windows 95 on network computers that
are already  running Windows 95, you have two options: 1) Do a clean
install on each  computer; or 2) Upgrade each computer using the
following procedure:

<OL><P><LI> Shut down any clients running from the server.
</OL>2.  Windows 95 must be installed on the server into the same folder
<PRE>    that you were using for previous builds. Delete everything in the
    shared Windows 95 folder, and then run Netsetup.exe to install
    this build into that folder.
</PRE></OL>3.  Restart the client to a command prompt.
4.  If you are using the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks and use
<PRE>    map rooted  drives, you must start either NETX or VLM to run
    Setup.
</PRE>5.  Map drives to the machine folder and shared Windows 95 folder
<PRE>    as before. These must use the same drive letters as used in the
    previous build, and map roots should be to the same folder level.
</PRE>6.  Run Setup for the new build.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Support for Third-Party Networks</h2>
 
<P>
To install support for a third-party, real-mode network, you must be
running the network when you run Windows 95 Setup. Windows 95 does not
support installation of a real-mode network after Setup, unless you
have a Windows 95-specific .inf file from your network vendor. For
example, FTP includes a Windows 95 .inf in their 32-bit NFS client.
Although Windows 95 supports other networks, network component files
for networks other than Microsoft networks are not included with
Windows 95. You must already have the files for the network you want
to install.
<P>
<P><h3>LANDESK 2.0</h3>
 
LANDESK version 2.0 uses a TSR named Usertsr.exe that may cause
Windows 95 to stop responding when you use the Microsoft IPX/SPX-
compatible protocol (Nwlink.vxd) or file and printer sharing for
Microsoft Networks (Vserver.vxd).
<P>
LANDESK version 2.01 fixes this problem, and the patch is available on
Intel's BBS or from Intel product support. For the BBS and product
support telephone numbers, consult the documentation that came with
your copy of LANDESK.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>SunSelect PC-NFS</h3>
 
Windows 95 supports versions 5.0 or greater of SunSelect PC-NFS.
If SunSelect PC-NFS is installed using an NDIS 2 LAN driver or an ODI
LAN driver, then SunSelect PC-NFS can be installed as an additional
16-bit network client along with 32-bit protected-mode clients. If you
are using a SunSelect PC-NFS LAN Driver, Windows 95 can support PC-NFS
only as the primary network. Additional 32-bit network providers are
not possible in this case.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Banyan VINES</h3>
 
If you see a message during startup that the VINES version is not the
latest, edit the Vines.ini file in the Windows folder so it contains
the following lines:
<P>
<PRE>   [NEWREV]
   dontcopy=1
   vines.version=5.5x (x) USA      ; where x=your version
   windows.version=3.95

</PRE>If you receive the message, "Vines NDIS Interface error: 1021. See
NDISBAN.DOC for an error description," during startup, run the VINES
utility PCCONFIG to change Banyan drivers to NDIS drivers. Also, make
sure the section name matches the driver name in the Protocol.ini
file.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>DEC Pathworks</h3>
 
Windows 95 provides support for upgrading over existing DEC
PATHWORKS V5.0, V5.0A and V5.1 configurations. This makes it possible
to run your existing real-mode PATHWORKS components while migrating
to Windows 95. However, it is strongly recommended that you upgrade
to DEC's PATHWORKS for Windows 95, which contains protected-mode
components.
<P>
Restrictions
<P>
PATHWORKS must be started before running Windows 95 Setup to
automatically detect and upgrade PATHWORKS components. If PATHWORKS is
not started or is not automatically detected, you will see startup
errors when you run STARTNET. To correct this, add the appropriate
"PATHWORKS V5.0 and above" protocol, using the Network icon in Control
Panel.
<P>
Once a system has been upgraded to Windows 95, you cannot change your
PATHWORKS configuration using PWSETUP. However, all existing template
configurations present when you upgrade are converted to work under
Windows 95.
<P>
PATHWORKS Native, DLC, X.25, and ISDN datalinks are converted to use
an NDIS driver, if available, during the upgrade. If the replacement
NDIS driver is not configured correctly or is not operating, startup
will display an error and prevent loading of other PATHWORKS
components.
<P>
To correct this, double-click the Network icon in Control Panel, and
verify that the adapter driver is configured correctly. If any changes
are made to the adapter configuration, you must remove the "PATHWORKS
V5.0 and above" protocol and add it again.
<P>
PATHWORKS NetWare client licenses (CCS or FPA) are not currently
supported with Windows 95. If you are using the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks to connect to PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) or
PATHWORKS for OSF/1 (NetWare) servers, the server must have PATHWORKS
FPS licenses.
<P>
Long filenames do not work correctly on PATHWORKS servers up to and
including version 5.0b. You will be able to create and delete LFN
files and make and remove LFN folders, but the files and folders will
not appear when you use the DIR command, or when you open an Explorer
window to the PATHWORKS server. PATHWORKS server version 5.00 EC01
corrects this problem and is available from DEC.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Artisoft LANtastic</h3>
 
The LANtastic server cannot be run when Windows 95 is setting up.
<P>
LANtastic also cannot be run in conjunction with networking support
for other networks.
<P>
<P>
Printing to a Network Printer
 
You may have problems setting up a printer that is shared by a third-
party network server. The solution is to redirect LPT1 through an MS-
DOS window to the third-party share, and then use the printer setup
for LPT1.
<P>
For example, if a network printer is connected to LPT1, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, type:
<P>
   net use lpt1: \\servername\sharename
<P>
   (This command may be different on the network you are using.
   Check the product documentation to find out how to redirect
   an LPT port.)

<P><LI>Start Control Panel, double-click Printers, and then double-click
   Add Printer.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h2>Problems Printing to PostScript Printers over a Netware Network</h2>
 
If you have problems when printing to a PostScript printer over a
network, (error messages on the printer; no output is printed), it may
be due to incorrectly configured Banner Pages. To solve this problem,
you can either 1) Disable banner pages by removing the check mark from
the Banner Pages box on the Capture printer properties (open the
Printers folder, click the icon for the printer you are using, and
then click Properties on the File menu); or 2) Ask your network
administrator to correctly configure banner pages on the Netware
server for a PostScript printer.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Issues and Installation of MS-DLC with Windows 95
-================================================
<P>
Windows 95 contains MS-DLC and support for installing over an existing
MS-DLC or IBM-DLC installation. Setup will detect DLC and make the
appropriate changes to your configuration files for these. Refer to
the Windows 95 Resource Kit, Chapter 10, for a complete description
of DLC support.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Microsoft TCP/IP Protocol</h2>
 
<P>
If Microsoft's TCP/IP is the only protocol you have loaded on your
system, the IP Address will not be added during Setup. If you have
a DHCP server, open Control Panel, double-click the Network icon, and
then close it. This will update the IP Address. (If you don't know if
you have a DHCP server, check with your network administrator, or
check if your IP address is already entered.)
<P>
If you don't have a DHCP server, start Control Panel, double-click
the Network icon, double-click TCP/IP, click the IP Address tab, and
then enter your IP Address.
<P>
If you are not updating from a previous Windows 95 installation (you
are doing a "clean install"), to use DNS or LMHOSTS name resolution,
make sure you have DNS enabled in the Network properties. To enable
DNS, double-click the Network icon in Control Panel, double-click
TCP/IP, click the DNS configuration tab, and then click Enable DNS.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>User Profiles over the Network</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using user profiles over a Windows NT or Novell NetWare
network, and you include Start Menu/Programs, Network Neighborhood,
and/or desktop icons in your profile, the server must have long
filename support to ensure that these parts of the user profile work
over the network.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Network Backup Agents</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Arcada Backup Exec Network Backup Agent</h3>
 
To use the Arcada Backup Exec network backup agent included in
Windows 95, you must have Arcada Backup Exec version 5.x.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Cheyenne ARCserve Network Backup Agent</h3>
 
To use the Cheyenne ARCserve network backup agent included in Windows
95, you must have Cheyenne ARCserve version 5.01F. You may also use
earlier versions if you obtain updated NLMs from Cheyenne Software.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Real-Mode Protocols: Warning Icons on Your Network Adapter</h2>
 
If you install a network that does not use protected-mode protocols,
such as Novell Netware 3.x, you may see a yellow warning icon next to
your network adapter in Device Manager. You can ignore this warning;
your network is fully functional. To remove the warning icon, use the
program, Extract.exe on Setup disk 1 to extract the file Ndis.vxd from
your Windows 95 disks. Then, copy Ndis.vxd into your Windows\System
folder. When you reboot your system, the yellow warning icon will no
longer appear.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Using an IBM Thinkpad with a Dock II</h2>
 
If you enable 32-bit PCMCIA support, and your network cards do not
appear to work properly when inserted into the Dock II's PCMCIA slots;
or, if you have an ISA network card in the Dock II that has a "Code
10" error in its properties in Device Manager, call the IBM Help
Center. They will provide you with a file to correct this problem.
