The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release version 2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a communications program has been configured to automatically answer
incoming calls and the computer is placed into a Suspended power-
management state, the computer does not resume when an incoming call
arrives.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This functionality, known as "Resume On Ring," is designed to allow the
modem to awaken the computer from a suspended state when an incoming call
arrives if the modem has been configured to automatically answer incoming
calls.
<P>
The Advanced Power Management features of Windows 95 OEM Service Release
2 (OSR2) do not support this functionality.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this issue, do not suspend the computer when the modem is
configured to automatically answer incoming calls.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95
OSR2. A fix to this problem is in development, but has not been regression
tested and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does
not recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information about the availability of this fix.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Resume On Ring feature is supported by the PC Card Event WakeUp
mechanism defined in the ExCA specification. This is an optional
mechanism, and it is not supported by all PC Card modems.
<P>
When a modem port is opened by a program, the modem is powered up in a
persistent state. When the computer is suspended, the modem is set up for
Resume On Ring, if it can be, because it is in a persistent-on power state.
<P>
