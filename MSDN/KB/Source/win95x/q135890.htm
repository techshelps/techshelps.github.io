<P>
NOTE: In general, the printer drivers provided with Windows 95 are
preferable to Windows 3.1 drivers for any given printer. However, you
might want to consult the printer manufacturer to determine the best
printing solution for your printer.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>PRINTING OVER A NETWORK</h2>
 
<P>
By default, Windows 95 uses the network path as the port designation
for network printers. This is slightly different from Windows 3.1, and
some programs might have problems. A network path (also known as a UNC
name) is typically in this format:
<PRE>     \\server\printqueue

</PRE>However, network paths tend to be longer than their Windows 3.1
equivalents, and this results in problems for some programs. If you
experience problems, you can revert to the Windows 3.1 method of
addressing network resources. For more information, look up
"capturing, printer ports" in the Windows Help Index.
<P>
Some programs may also experience difficulties if the network path
contains a space character. This can be resolved as described above,
or you can change the network path so it does not contain spaces. See
your network administrator for help with changing the network path
name.
<P>
Problems Printing to PostScript Printers Over a NetWare Network
 
If you have difficulties printing to a PostScript printer over a
network, it may be because banner pages are incorrectly configured on
the NetWare server. Unless banner pages are correctly configured on
the NetWare server, they will cause errors and nothing will print. To
solve this problem, you can either disable banner pages by removing
the check mark from the Banner Pages box in Capture printer
properties, or contact your network administrator to correctly
configure banner pages on the NetWare server for a PostScript printer.
<P>
<P><h3>Unwanted Banner Pages on a NetWare Network from MS-DOS Programs</h3>
 
If you are still receiving unwanted banner pages when printing from
MS-DOS programs after checking the Banner Page setting as described
above, you'll need to change the port designation for the printer from
the network path (UNC) name, to the Captured port. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>On the Details tab of printer properties, click the down-arrow on
   the box that shows the \\Server\Printqueue name, and look for an
   entry that shows LPTx:, where LPTx: is the LPT port you have
   captured.
</OL>2. Select LPTx: (\\Server\Printqueue), and then click Apply.
3. Click the Capture tab, and then disable the banner page setting as
<PRE>   described above.


</PRE></OL><h2>TRUETYPE FONT AVAILABILITY FOR PRINTING</h2>
 
<P>
TrueType fonts are not usually available when printing in lower
resolutions (75-150 dpi) on inkjet printers. This does not apply to
laser and dot-matrix printers. TrueType fonts are also not available
when using the Generic/Text Only printer driver.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>CANON COLOR BUBBLE-JET SUPPORT</h2>
 
<P>
You may notice some printing differences in the Windows 95 drivers
for the Canon Color Bubble-Jet (BJC) printers if you upgrade from
Windows 3.1. The Canon BJC-70, BJC-600, BJC-600e, BJC-800, and BJC-
4000 drivers from Windows 3.1 are automatically upgraded to Windows 95
drivers as part of the Windows 95 installation because the Windows 3.1
versions do not work under Windows 95. Please contact your local Canon
representative company (or refer to the information in the "Where to
Find More Help" section of your printer's manual) for information
about updated driver availability for optimal support of these
devices.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>FARGO PRIMERA AND PRIMERA PRO SUPPORT</h2>
 
<P>
Some older versions of the Fargo Primera and Primera Pro printer
drivers do not operate correctly under Windows 95. The Fargo Primera
requires version 4.3 or later, and the Primera Pro requires version
2.7 or later. To obtain either of these drivers, contact Fargo's BBS
or their technical support at the numbers listed in the printer
documentation.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>HEWLETT-PACKARD DESKJET PRINTER SUPPORT</h2>
 
<P>
Versions 6.1 and earlier of the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet printer
drivers will not function under Windows 95, and it is not possible to
install them. If you are using them with Windows 3.1, they will be
upgraded to version 6.5 with Windows 95. See the following section if
you are using a DeskJet 600 or 800 series model.
<P>
<P><h3>Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 600, 660C, and 850C Printer Support</h3>
 
To optimally use your DeskJet 600, 660C, or 850C, determine if your
DeskJet printer includes a printer driver that is compatible with
Windows 95. (To determine if your printer driver is compatible with
with Windows 95, refer to the disk label.)
<P>
Case 1: If you have a printer driver that is compatible with Windows
95.
<P>
If you already have Windows 95 installed and are installing a new
DeskJet 600 or 800 series printer, Windows 95 automatically identifies
your printer and installs the printer driver. When you see the prompt
asking for the OEM-provided disk, click OK, and then insert the HP
DeskJet Printer disk #1 that came with your printer into the
appropriate floppy disk driver.  Follow the steps displayed on your
screen.
<P>
If Windows 95 does not automatically detect your HP DeskJet printer,
follow the steps listed on the label of the HP DeskJet Printer Driver
disk #1 that came with your printer.
<P>
If you are upgrading from Windows 3.1 to Windows 95 and already have
your DeskJet installed with a Windows 95 compatible printer driver
(version 7.0 or greater), you do not need to do anything else.
<P>
Case 2: If you do not have a Windows 95 compatible printer driver (you
have a Windows 3.1-only printer driver).
<P>
To obtain a Windows 95 compatible printer driver for your DeskJet
printer, contact the HP Driver Distribution Center referenced in your
HP DeskJet Printer Users Manual.  Until you obtain your Windows 95
printer driver, follow the instructions below to enable printing under
Windows 95.

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.
</OL>2. Click the Add Printer icon, and then follow the instructions on
<PRE>   your screen.
</PRE></OL>3. When you are asked to select the printer manufacturer and model

   printer; or the "HP DeskJet 540" if you have a DeskJet 600.
</PRE>4. Click Next, and then follow the steps displayed on the screen.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>HEWLETT-PACKARD LASERJET PRINTER SUPPORT</h2>
