The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release version 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you cancel the setup of OEM Service Release version 2.1 (OSR2.1) over
OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) during the file copy stage, you receive a
successful setup message and you are prompted to restart your computer.
The next time you start your computer, you may receive real-mode error
messages and a Windows Protection Error message, after which the computer
stops responding (hangs). Subsequent reboots generate the same errors.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Some of the OSR2.1 files were not copied to the computer and Setup was not
completed. Your computer contains a mixture of OSR2 and OSR2.1 files.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Run the OSR2.1 uninstall tool. This is a file named Rem.pss on the
installation disk. To use the uninstall tool, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message,
   press the F8 key, and then choose Safe Mode Command Prompt Only from
   the Startup menu.

<P><LI>Copy the Rem.pss file to the root directory of the boot drive as a
   file named Remusb.bat.

<P><LI>Type "remusb" (without quotation marks) to restore your original
   files.

<P><LI>Restart your computer normally. Use the Add/Remove Programs tool in
   Control Panel to remove the program named "WDM/USB Supplement."
<P>
   NOTE: This program may not be listed in the Add/Remove Programs tool
   depending on when Setup was canceled. If it is not listed, skip this
   step.

<P><LI>Delete the Remusb.bat file from the root directory of the boot
   drive.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are several stages to Setup, and canceling Setup during most of them
is harmless. The following list summarizes these stages:

<UL><LI>End User License Agreement - OK to cancel

<LI>ScanDisk - Cancelling Setup during ScanDisk (or canceling ScanDisk
   itself) is OK

<LI>Initial extraction from cabinet files - OK to cancel

<LI>Actual file copy stage - problems will occur if you cancel Setup at
   this point.
