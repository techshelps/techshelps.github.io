The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You receive the following error messages when you run DriveSpace to perform
an operation that requires full restartability:

<UL><LI>Files required to manage your compressed drive(s) are missing on drive
   &lt;x&gt;. To restore these files, copy the MINI.CAB file from your Windows 95
   Setup Disk 1 or CD-ROM into your Windows directory. The next time you
   run DriveSpace, the missing files will be restored.
<P>
   ID Number: DRVSPACE575
<P>
   -and-

<LI>Windows might not be able to restart this operation if it is
   interrupted. Check to make sure drive x is not full; you may need as
   much as 1.5 MB of free space to continue.
<P>
   ID Number: DRVSPACE311
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors occur when the files in the hidden FAILSAFE.DRV\FAILSAFE
directory on drive C (or the host for drive C) are missing and DriveSpace
cannot find the MINI.CAB file in your Windows 95 SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
These errors can also occur if there is a file named Failsafe.drv in the
root folder of drive C (or the host for drive C).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Copy the MINI.CAB file from your original Windows 95 distribution media to
your Windows 95 SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
NOTE: MINI.CAB is located on the standard 1.44-megabyte (MB) disk 1 of the
3.5-inch distribution media format (DMF) disk set and can be copied using
Windows Explorer or at an MS-DOS prompt (using EXTRACT is not necessary).
On CD-ROM installation media, MINI.CAB is located in the WIN95 directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
DriveSpace operations that can prevent Windows from restarting properly if
interrupted by a power loss or accidental reboot are fully restartable. To
ensure restartability in these cases, DriveSpace uses a mini-version of
Windows (a subset of Windows 3.1 also used by Setup).
<P>
DriveSpace extracts the mini-version files (from the MINI.CAB file in your
Windows 95 SYSTEM subdirectory to a hidden FAILSAFE.DRV directory on the
physical boot drive) before beginning an operation that requires full
restartability. This ensures that DriveSpace can complete its operation in
the event of a power loss or accidental reboot.
<P>
DriveSpace requires the mini-version of Windows during the following
operations:

<UL><LI>Compressing an existing drive that contains Windows files (including the
   swap file).

<LI>Uncompressing a DriveSpace- or DoubleSpace-compressed drive that
   contains Windows files (including the swap file).

<LI>Changing the size of a DriveSpace- or DoubleSpace-compressed drive that
   contains Windows files (including the swap file).

<LI>Changing the estimated compression ratio (ECR) for a DriveSpace- or
   DoubleSpace-compressed drive that contains Windows files (including the
   swap file).
<P>
</UL>You should not delete the FAILSAFE.DRV directory created by DriveSpace
unless you have a MINI.CAB file in your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.
DriveSpace does not delete FAILSAFE.DRV after successfully completing a
restartable operation. This allows future restartable operations to be
completed more quickly.
