<OL><P><LI> Q. How do I make backup copies of my original Windows 95 disks
<P><PRE>       before I install Windows 95?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Windows 95 disks are Distribution Media Format (DMF) disks and
       are not compatible with the MS-DOS COPY and DISKCOPY commands.
       You cannot create backup copies of the Windows 95 disks.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What happens if the power fails or if my computer restarts
<P><PRE>       during Setup?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Windows 95 Setup has a feature called Safe Recovery. Depending
       on where Setup was interrupted, you may be able to simply turn
       your computer off and back on, run Setup again, and choose Safe
       Recovery when you are prompted.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What do I do if Setup stops responding (hangs) while it is
<P><PRE>       detecting the hardware in my computer?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. If Setup hangs while it is detecting the hardware in your
       computer, turn your computer off and back on, run Setup again,
       and choose Safe Recovery when you are prompted.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why does Setup tell me I am running virus-protection software
<P><PRE>       when I cannot find any on my computer?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Some computers have built-in virus protection. If virus
       protection is enabled in your computer's CMOS settings, Setup
       cannot continue. Please contact your hardware vendor for
       information about temporarily disabling this feature.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How do I install a feature of Windows 95 that I did not install
<P><PRE>       originally?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. If you want to add or remove a Windows 95 component, use the
       Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. On the Windows Setup
       tab, click the items you want to add or remove.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What is Setup doing when I see the "Getting ready to run
<P><PRE>       Windows 95 for the first time" screen?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. After Setup restarts your computer, it must complete the
       installation process. Setup accomplishes the following tasks
       while the "Getting ready to run Windows 95 for the first time"
       screen is displayed:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - Setup processes the Wininit.ini file and combines all the
          virtual device drivers listed in the [CombineVxDs] section of
          the file into one file called Vmm32.vxd. Combining these
          drivers provides faster startup times.

        - Setup renames all the files that were in use during the first
          portion of Setup. For example, Setup renames the User32.tmp
          file to User32.exe and renames the Command.new file to
          Command.com.

        - Setup makes a backup copy of the registry for troubleshooting
          purposes.

       After these tasks are accomplished, Setup starts the Windows 95
       graphical user interface (GUI) and completes the installation
       process by converting program groups, setting up the Help
       system, and setting your location and time zone.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. If I run Setup over an existing Windows 95 installation, I
<P><PRE>       receive the following two options:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - Restore Windows files that are changed

        - Copy all Windows files again

       Setup seems to take just as long no matter which option I
       choose. Why?

    A. Both of these options verify the validity of Windows 95 files.
       Verifying the Windows 95 files takes as long as an original
       installation because Setup must open each cabinet file to
       verify the Windows 95 files. Setup uses the Setuplog.txt file
       to determine which files to check and marks each good file with
       an "S." This mode also rebuilds the Vmm32.vxd file and recopies
       any file with a lost long filename.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. Is there a way to remove Windows 95?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. To do so, you must choose to save your computer's system
       files on the hard disk during Setup. You cannot store the
       "uninstall" file on a network drive or floppy disk. To remove
       Windows 95, use these three steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
<PRE></PRE>          Control Panel.

       2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

       3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Windows 95, and then
          click Remove.

       You can also remove Windows 95 by starting your computer with
       the Windows 95 Startup Disk and then typing "uninstal" (without
       the quotation marks) at the command prompt.

       NOTE: You are not prompted to save the system files during
       Setup if any of the following conditions apply:

        - You are installing Windows 95 in an empty directory.

        - You are not running MS-DOS version 5.0 or later.

        - You are reinstalling Windows 95 over itself.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. I am not having any problems with Windows 95. How do I delete
<P><PRE>       the "uninstall" files created by Setup?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. To delete the "uninstall" files and free disk space, use these
       three steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
<PRE></PRE>          Control Panel.

       2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

       3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Old Windows 3.x/MS-DOS
          System Files, and then click Remove.

       Once you delete these files, you cannot use the Uninstall tool
       to remove Windows 95.

10. Q. Is there an Administrative Setup for network installations?

    A. The /A and /N Setup switches have been replaced by the Netsetup
       tool. This tool is available in the CD-ROM version of Windows 95.
       Network administrators can use this tool to set up a shared copy of
       Windows 95 that others can use to set up local or shared Windows 95
       installations. Users can also create custom scripts to automate the
       Setup process from the shared copy of Windows 95.
