The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using Windows 95 to dial into a Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking
server, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The computer you're dialing into does not respond to a network
   request. Check your server type setting in the properties of the
   connection.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error can be caused by one or more of the following conditions:

<UL><LI>The network protocols in the connectoid have not been configured
   correctly.

<LI>The network protocols in the connectoid do not match the protocols on
   the server.

<LI>The protocol configured in the connectoid is either not installed in
   Network properties or is damaged.

<LI>A terminal logon is required after negotiation.

<LI>Dial-Up Networking Server has not been installed or enabled on the
   server.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve the problem, use the appropriate method(s):

<UL><LI>Check Network properties for the client and the server, and the
   connectoid properties to ensure that a matching protocol has been
   installed on both computers. If the protocol is already present, remove
   the Dial-Up adapter and all protocols and reinstall Dial-up Networking.
<P>
   To check the connectoid properties, click the Start button, point to
   Programs, point to Accessories, and then click Dial-up Networking. Use
   the right mouse button to click the connectoid, and then click
   Properties.

<LI>If the IPX protocol is being used, ensure that the frame type on the
   server and the client match. To do this, click IPX/SPX in Network
   properties. Click Properties, click the Advanced tab, and then click
   Frame Type.

<LI>Verify that the line protocol on the client is the same as the server.
   To do this, use the right mouse button to click the connectoid in Dial-
   Up Networking, click Properties, and then click the Server Types tab.
   Check the type of Dial-Up Server.

<LI>If TCP/IP is being used, check to see if the server is using DHCP or
   static IP addresses. If static IP addresses are being used, make sure
   you enter the IP address in the connectoid's properties. To set the IP
   address, use the right mouse button to click the connectoid in Dial-Up
   Networking, click Properties, click the Server Types tab, and then
   click TCP/IP Settings. Click Specify An IP Address and enter the
   address assigned by your network administrator or Internet service
   provider (ISP).

<LI>Enable the "Bring up terminal window after dialing" option on the
   Options tab in the connectoid's properties. This should be necessary
   only if the server does not support CHAP, PAP, or SPAP authentication
   for PPP line protocol connection. This is not necessary if the server
   is a Windows 95-based or Windows NT-based computer.

<LI>Make sure that Dial-Up Networking Server has been installed on the
   Windows 95-based server. Dial-Up Networking Server is available with
   Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95. If Dial-Up Networking Server is
   installed, verify that the Server option is enabled. To do so, follow
   these steps:
<P>
   1. Click Dial-Up Server on the Connection menu in Dial-Up Networking
<P>
   2. Click the Allow Caller Access option.
<P>
   3. If you are using share-level security, click Change Password and set
<P><PRE>      the password. If you are using user-level security, click Add and
      add the users you want to be able to dial in.
</PRE><P>
   4. If necessary, click Server Type and select either "PPP: Windows 95,
<P><PRE>      Windows NT, Internet" or "Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT
      3.1." The default is PPP. "Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT
      3.1" should be used only if Windows for Workgroups 3.11-based
      computers with RAS installed will dial in.
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: TCP/IP is not recommended because Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking
   Server is point-to-point, not point-to-LAN. If you want to use TCP/IP,
   you need to dial into a Microsoft Windows NT Workstation- or Server-
   based computer with RAS enabled to be a server.
