The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using a Motorola Power 14.4 Cellular Modem with Windows 95,
you may not be able to dial the second time you try to use the modem.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The initialization string used for this modem in Windows 95 enables a
dial suffix. This dial suffix enables transmission of tones after the
connection has been made without breaking the connection. One example
of how this feature is used is in an electronic banking service. This
behavior is also known as staged dialing.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Remove and reinsert the modem to dial again. You must repeat this process
each time you want to dial again.
<P>
To prevent this behavior from occurring, use the following method to
disable staged dialing.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft does not encourage or support making changes to .inf
files. Therefore, Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) does not
support the following procedure. Although we have tested this procedure
and it appears to function as described, you should make a backup copy of
the Mdmmoto.inf file in the Windows\Inf folder before you proceed.

<OL><P><LI>Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the Mdmmoto.inf file
   in the Windows\Inf folder.
<P>
   NOTE: The Inf folder is a hidden folder in the Windows folder. To
   view this folder, start Windows Explorer, click Options on the View
   menu, click Show All Files on the View tab, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Add the following line to the end of the [Modem16.AddReg] section
   of the file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKR, Settings, DialSuffix,, ""
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save and then close the file.

<P><LI>Remove the Motorola Power 14.4 modem using the Modems tool in
   Control Panel.

<P><LI>Remove and reinsert the modem.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The behavior described in this article occurs only with 32-bit
communications programs such as HyperTerminal and Dial-Up Networking. When
you use a 32-bit communications program, the modem works correctly the
first time you dial after starting Windows 95 or inserting the modem, but
does not respond on subsequent attempts to dial.
