The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run an MS-DOS-based program in a full screen, you may be unable to
switch to another program using the ALT+TAB or CTRL+ESC key combinations.
When you try to switch to another program, the computer may beep. This
problem can occur with the following types of MS-DOS-based programs:

<UL><LI>Programs that use a high-resolution graphics mode (such as SVGA or
   VESA modes).

<LI>Programs that use a high-resolution text mode.

<LI>Hard disk tools such as disk defragmenter or undelete tools.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you are running an MS-DOS-based program that uses a high-resolution
graphics or text mode, the problem occurs because the program is using a
video mode that the virtual display driver cannot save and restore. If you
switched to another program, you would not be able to switch back because
the virtual display driver could not restore the screen.
<P>
If you are running a hard disk tool, the problem occurs because the tool
has taken an exclusive-access lock on one or more of the drives in the
computer. When a drive has been locked by an MS-DOS-based program, Windows
95 will not switch away from that program.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are running an MS-DOS-based program that uses a high-resolution
graphics or text mode, you may be able to work around the problem by
configuring the program to use a lower resolution. For information about
how to do so, please consult the program's documentation or manufacturer.
<P>
If you are running a hard disk tool, you cannot switch programs until you
quit the tool. Windows 95 will not switch away from an MS-DOS-based program
that has locked a drive.
