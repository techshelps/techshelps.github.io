The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are setting up Windows, the mouse attached to your computer is
incorrectly identified as a PS/2-style or an Inport (bus) mouse and the
mouse does not work.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Setup detects mouse ports in the following order: Inport, PS/2, serial.
When the detection routine finds the mouse port, it stops searching. For
example, if Setup finds an Inport card, it stops searching for the mouse.
<P>
<P><h3>Inport Card</h3>
 
<P>
If an Inport-style mouse card is installed in the computer, the detection
routine sees this card first and uses it, even if the mouse is not attached
to it. This occurs because the Inport card is the circuit board for the
mouse. Detaching the mouse from the card does not disable the card.
<P>
<P><h3>PS/2-Style Mouse</h3>
 
<P>
If a PS/2-style mouse is installed, the 0x04 bit is set in the equipment
flags. In some computers, the BIOS mistakenly sets this bit when a second
hard disk is installed and no PS/2-style mouse exists. When Setup issues an
INT 11 (get equipment flags) and sees that this bit is set, it determines
that there is a PS/2-style mouse attached to your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>For an Inport card, remove the card from the computer before you run
   Setup.

<LI>For a PS/2-style mouse port, contact your computer vendor about a
   possible BIOS upgrade.

<LI>For either type of mouse, run Setup with the /ID switch and choose
   the proper mouse type when you are prompted.

<LI>For either type of mouse, set the correct type in the "MouseType="
   line in the MOUSE.INI file before you run Setup. Note that the mouse
   driver you are using must support the use of a MOUSE.INI file for this
   method to work. For additional information about the "MouseType="
   setting, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
