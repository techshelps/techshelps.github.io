<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the tasks Program Group Control (PGC) performs
during startup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
PGC checks the following during startup:

<OL><P><LI>Detect new shared applications and make them available.
<P>
   During PGC startup, PGC checks the NAD database for any new shared
   applications and program groups. PGC updates its internal data
   structures in the registry for the new items.

<P><LI>Detect obsolete shared applications and remove them.
<P>
   If the NADNAME (shared application ID) is no longer valid (there is no
   corresponding entry in the NAD database), then the application is
   removed from PGC internal data structures. If the NADNAME is valid, but
   refers to a different application, then the internal entry is obsolete,
   and needs to be removed also.

<P><LI>Remove references to shared applications for users who do not have
   permission for them.
<P>
   If the user does not have permission for an application, the deinstall
   program specified in the PDF is run to remove it from the "insert
   object" dialog menus. Likewise, when it is discovered that the user does
   have permission for an application that was previously denied, the
   application objects is placed back into the "insert object" dialogs.

<P><LI>Make and update program groups and icons for the shared applications.
<P>
   Every time that PGC starts up, it verifies all the program groups and
   icons which have been assigned. If there are any new groups or items,
   they are added. If items are removed, the corresponding groups and
   items are deleted.
