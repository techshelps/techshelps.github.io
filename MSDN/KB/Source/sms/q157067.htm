The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When Systems Management Server inventory is run on some computers running
Windows NT, the network card MAC address, configuration information, and IP
address information may not be reported. This will result in either blank
or NULL information being reported in the personal computer Properties for
that system.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Systems Management Server inventories computers running Windows NT by
querying the Windows NT registry. If the Netcard entry in the registry is
not the first entry, Systems Management Server will not find the
information. This problem may occur if there is one or more RAS adapters
installed on the system. This problem may also occur if a network card had
been replaced in the system. When Windows NT installs a new network card,
it adds the new information in the registry with a new entry. It does not
reuse an existing entry.
<P>
For example, when a network card is first installed, a registry entry will
be created as "Netcard1". If this network card is then replaced, or if
other network cards are installed and this one is removed, the new network
cards will be named "Netcard2," Netcard3," "Netcard4," and so on.
<P>
Systems Management Server inventory currently does not scan through these
additional entries to find the new network card information.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.1 and 1.2. A supported fix is now available, but has not been
fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing
this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that
contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
