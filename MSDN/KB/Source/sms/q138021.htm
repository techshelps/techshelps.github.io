<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how Inventory Dataloader finds matching computers in
the Systems Management Server database.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Inventory Data Loader uses the Identification group in the MIF to
determine how to search the database for a matching computer. The
Identification group has a group class of "MICROSOFT|IDENTIFICATION|1.0".
If any of the attributes in this group are designated as keys, then only
those attributes are used for matching. If no key attributes are
designated, all attributes in the Identification group will be used for
matching. If there is an attribute named "SMSID" and if this attribute is a
key attribute, it is used alone to identify a matching computer, even if
other keys exist and do not match.
<P>
In Systems Management Server 1.1, there are the following attributes in the
Identification group: Name, SMSID, Site, Domain, SMSLocation, SystemRole,
SystemType, LogOnName, and NetCardID.
<P>
In Systems Management Server, Name, SMSID and NetCardID are defined as key
attributes.
<P>
The matching logic proceeds as follows:

<OL><P><LI>An attempt is made to find a computer matching all key attributes (or
   all attributes if there are no keys). If this search finds a single
   computer, that computer is selected and no other searches are performed.
   If this search finds more than one computer, all the computers found are
   deleted, a RESYNC command is sent, and no other searches are performed.
   If no computers are found and there is no SMSID attribute, the computer
   defined in the MIF is considered to be a new computer. If no computers
   are found and an SMSID key attribute exists, proceed to step 2.

<P><LI>An attempt is made to find a computer with a matching SMSID. If this
   search finds more than one computer, all the computers found are
   deleted, a RESYNC command is sent, and no other searches are performed.
   If this search finds a single computer, that computer is selected and we
   proceed to step 3. If no computers are found by this search, proceed to
   step 3.

<P><LI>This query searches for all computers that have any key attributes in
   the Identification group with the same value as the computer being
   processed. (If there are no key attributes, all attributes in the
   Identification group are compared.) An event will be issued for each
   computer in the database that has one or more matching attributes. This
   query does not select a computer for update. If a computer was not found
   in either of the prior steps, the computer being processed is considered
   a new computer.
