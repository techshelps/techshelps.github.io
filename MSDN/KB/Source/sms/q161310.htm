The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When Package Command Manager (PCM) is running on a NetWare client, and it
attempts to launch a package that has been distributed to more than 10
NetWare servers, PCM may not be able to find the package. This can occur
even if the current logon server contains a copy of the package.
<P>
An error dialog box is displayed that shows a list of 10 servers that were
searched for this package, one of which is the current NetWare logon
server. Examining the displayed server paths shows that the package source
path for the current logon server is incorrect. The path may show as
"\\&lt;logon server&gt;\&lt;volume&gt;\pcmpkg.src\&lt;pkg id&gt;," when the path should have
been "\\&lt;logon server&gt;\&lt;volume&gt;\SMS\logon.srv\pcmpkg.src\&lt;pkg id&gt;."
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the current user does not have access rights to
the 10 distribution servers that are currently listed in the package server
list.
<P>
When PCM attempts to find a distribution server, it attempts to find the
package in the following sequence:

<OL><P><LI>Check the distribution server list for the package, to see if the
   current logon server exists in the list. If it does exist, then use that
   server as the distribution server.

<P><LI>Check the server names for each currently connected drive letter. If any
   of the server names for the currently connected drives match a server in
   the package distribution list, then use that server as the distribution
   server.

<P><LI>Check the current logon server for the package, using the explicit path
   to the package share. This is to ensure that the current logon server
   does actually contain the package, even if it is not in the list of 10
   package servers.

<P><LI>If steps 1-3 fail, randomly pick a server from the package distribution
   list, and connect to that server. If the connection fails for any
   reason, randomly pick another server from the package server list until
   either a server is connected, or the list is exhausted.
<P>
</OL>In step three, when PCM tests for the package on the current logon server,
the tested package path is incorrect for a NetWare server. The path is
correct for all other supported server types.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, assign access rights to the user for one of
the distribution servers in the package list.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that
contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
