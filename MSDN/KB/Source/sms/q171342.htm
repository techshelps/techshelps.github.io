The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to install Microsoft Office 4.x, Microsoft Office 95, or
Microsoft Office 97 as a shared application to be run with Program Group
Control (PGC). However, each of these versions of Office are somewhat
unique in installation and behavior when used as a Systems Management
Server shared application. This article highlights some of the similarities
and differences to expect between the Office versions.
<P>
This article assumes a good working understanding of Systems Management
Server shared applications. Please refer to the Systems Management Server
product documentation for information, instructions, and examples of shared
applications, sharing packages, and Share Package On Server jobs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following setup procedures are consistent across all versions of
Office:

<OL><P><LI>Run Setup.exe with the "/a" parameter to perform an administrative
   installation when creating the source directory.

<P><LI>Use the latest package definition file (PDF) from
   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt/">http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt/.</A></B> If the PDF has not been updated, use
   the PDF supplied with Systems Management Server 1.2, located in the
   Primsite.srv\Import.src\Enu directory, or the PDF included on your
   source media.

<P><LI>Check the product documentation and Readme.txt files for comments about
   shared installations in general, and Systems Management Server in
   particular.

<P><LI>Create a separate package and job to send out the Msapps components of
   Office (such as OrgChart, Microsoft Graph, WordArt, and so on).
<P>
   NOTE: The Msapps and MSOffice source and destination directories cannot
   be the same.

<P><LI>You must perform a one-time initial installation. This is specified by
   the ConfigurationScript entry in the [Program Item Properties] section
   of the PDF, or the Configuration Command Line in the Program Item
   Properties dialog box, when setting up the package. If you are
   installing Office on a computer running Windows NT Workstation, the user
   must have Administrator rights to run the one-time installation. The
   one-time installation will make appropriate .ini file and registry
   changes on the clients, and may copy some files locally to the Windows
   directory.

<P><LI>Any customized modifications to the Office .stf files are not supported
   by Microsoft.

<P><LI>The source media must be a full, unrestricted license version. Limited
   license versions (such as OEM or MSDN versions) will fail to install
   correctly.

<P><LI>To use the Office toolbar and OLE functions, you must install all of the
   Office applications.

<P><LI>Click to check the Run Local Copy If Present option in the Package
   Properties.
<P>
</OL><h3>Microsoft Office 4.2x and 4.3</h3>
 
<P>
PDFs are available for Office 4.2a, 4.2c, 4.3 and 4.3c. Use the
Msapps.pdf file for the Msapps package.
<P>
Office 4.x requires the appropriate Smsproxy directory (located in the
Primsite.srv\Import.src\Enu directory) to be copied to the source of the
administrative share. Smssetup.exe runs the configuration command line.
<P>
Program Group Control (PGC) creates an icon for each Office application
when the user's User Groups are enumerated. As the user clicks on each
application, the application runs its own one-time installation as
described above. You must run the one-time installation for each Office
application (that is, once for Microsoft Word, once for Microsoft Excel,
once for Microsoft Access, and so on).
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office 95</h3>
 
<P>
PDFs are available for Office 95 and 95a. The Office Standard PDF is
Ofs95.pdf. The Office Professional PDF is Ofp95.pdf. Use the Msapps32.pdf
for the Msapps package.
<P>
Office 95 does not use SMSPROXY. Smsacm32.exe runs the configuration
command line for Office 95.
<P>
Program Group Control creates a single MSOffice icon when the user's User
Groups are enumerated. When the user double-clicks the icon, the one-time
installation runs for all Office applications at once and creates the
program items for each application.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office 97</h3>
 
<P>
You must download the Office 97 Professional PDF (Of97prof.pdf)
and the Msapps PDF (Msapps97.pdf) for sharing from
<B><A HREF="http://microsoft.com/smsmgmt/pdfs.htm">http://microsoft.com/smsmgmt/pdfs.htm.</A></B> the Office 97 Resource Kit includes
additional PDFs for specific applications and the Office 97 Standard
version.
<P>
Office 97 does not use SMSPROXY. Smsacm32.exe runs the configuration
command line for Office 97.
<P>
A white paper called "Using Microsoft Systems Management Server to Install
Office 97" is available at <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt">http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt.</A></B> Download this
paper and read it for step-by-step instructions.
<P>
Running Office 97 as a shared application requires Systems Management
Server 1.2 Service Pack 1 or later.
<P>
With client computers running Windows NT, the one-time Office 97 Setup
installs the icons in a global (All Users) group. This means that the
program items are not generated dynamically for each user, and it is up to
you to monitor your own Office license usage. Also, the shortcuts for the
program items point to the UNC name for the distribution share from which
the one-time installation was run, and the applications will always run
from that share. Load-balancing will not be performed (as it is with
Appstart in Office 95 or Office 4.x), and if the distribution server is
unavailable for some reason, the Office 97 shared application will fail to
start.
<P>
In Systems Management Server 1.2, Windows 95 introduced the Network Naming
Provider (NNP) to dynamically choose a distribution server. If the
distribution server is unavailable, another distribution server will be
chosen.
