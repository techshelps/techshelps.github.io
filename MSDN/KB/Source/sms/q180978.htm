The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Systems Management Server service account is used by the Site
Configuration Manager, Hierarchy Manager, and Systems Management Server
Executive services. This account is also used for the Package Command
Manager (PCM) client component service on Systems Management Server logon
servers in the site. Because this account sets up and maintains directories
and shares, installs services, and writes to the registry, it requires
local Administrator rights on the computers it maintains (including logon
servers, distribution servers, and helper servers). Additionally, if the
"Auto-detect All Logon Servers" option is enabled, every member server will
also have the Systems Management Server Inventory Agent and the PCM service
installed on them. The PCM service on these servers uses the Systems
Management Server service account.
<P>
When security boundaries must be drawn to fit into an organizational or
administrative model, Systems Management Server hierarchies should be
developed. Each site should contain its own service account and password.
When a site hierarchy is developed along security divisions, it is
necessary to not have multiple sites in a single domain, because the
account for each site must reside in the domain.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Generally speaking, the less secure the environment, the easier it is to
administer, in terms of deployment and password changes. A secure
environment requires more complex administration.
<P>
Normally, the Systems Management Server service account is granted Domain
Administrator rights to the domains within the site. When this is done,
there is an assumption made that the local administrator of the site server
and logon servers is also a Domain Administrator, and visa versa.
<P>
It is possible to have a multiple site hierarchy and have all sites use the
same account and password. If Systems Management Server is configured this
way, account maintenance is simplified. Multiple sites with unique
passwords require more account maintenance. It is also possible to create a
user account for the sender (a thread of the Systems Management Server
Executive service) to use for inter-site communications. The sender account
does not need to be a Domain Administrator, rather a Domain User with
limited rights. The only requirement of the sender account is that it must
have Administrator rights on each site server's SMS_SITE share
(&lt;SMS_root&gt;\Sms\Despooler.box\Receive). After creating a user account, you
can configure the sender to use a specified account in the Addresses
portion of the Site Properties.
<P>
For more information, refer to the Concepts and Planning Guide in the
online documentation.
