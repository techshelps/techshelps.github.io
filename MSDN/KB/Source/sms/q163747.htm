<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a child site attempts to communicate with its parent site, it
incorrectly tries to use the Systems Management Server service account
before using the LAN sender account, which may be different.
<P>
The following situation may cause the child site to actually disable the
Systems Management Server service account being used by the parent site:

<OL><P><LI>The parent site exists in domain A and the child site is in domain B;
   there are no trust relationships.

<P><LI>The Systems Management Server service account has the same name but
   different passwords in each domain.

<P><LI>When the child site tries to communicate with the parent site by
   connecting to the parent site's SMS_SITE share, it attempts to connect
   with its Systems Management Server service account.

<P><LI>If the "Account Lockout" option is enabled in domain A, this may result
   in the Systems Management Server service account in domain A being
   disabled. This would essentially cripple the parent site.
<P>
</OL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do any one of the following:

<UL><LI>Use Systems Management Server service accounts that do not have the same
   name. Or, if the service accounts need to have the same name, make
   certain that the passwords match.

<LI>Disable the "Account Lockout" option in the Account (under User Manager,
   go to Policies, and then Account).

<LI>Create a trust relationship so that the parent site's domain trusts the
   child site's domain.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
