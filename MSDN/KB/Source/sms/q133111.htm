<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Systems Management Server Hierarchy Manager is a Win32 service that
manages the multiple-site hierarchy when the user has multiple sites. It
coordinates the transfer of configuration information between sites,
handles the construction, modification, and destruction of the multiple
site hierarchy, and controls the actual setup, installation, upgrade, and
deinstallation of secondary sites. For single site installations, the
Hierarchy Manager assists in the setup and reconfiguration of the site.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Multiple site hierarchies are constructed in two ways; by connecting
Primary Sites together, and by creating Secondary Sites immediately beneath
Primary Sites.
<P>
All Primary sites are created by running Systems Management Server Setup.
Secondary Sites are created using the SMS Administrator. Primary Sites have
a Systems Management Server Administrator and a SQL database. Secondary
sites have no Systems Management Server Administrator or SQL database.
<P>
The terms parent and child, when applied to SMS sites, have their standard
meanings used in any tree-based data structure. The site hierarchy tree
formed can be any arbitrary multi-way tree, subject to the following rules:

<OL><P><LI>A site can only have one parent. A strict multi-way tree structure
   is observed, where each node can only have one parent and an
   arbitrary number of children. A directed cyclic graph is not
   possible, nor are kind of cycles possible. In other words, the site
   tree cannot contain any kind of circular references and sites
   cannot have more than one parent.

<P><LI>Secondary sites cannot report to each other in a parent-child
   relationship. Each secondary site must report to a primary site as
   its immediate parent. There is no mechanism at secondary sites to
   forward information to another site in this way.

<P><LI>Primary sites are added to the tree from the bottom up. A parent
   site does not acquire a primary child site. A primary child site
   must decide to report to a parent and attach to the parent site
   after creating an address to that site.

<P><LI>Primary sites can decide to detach themselves from their parent
   site and become a top-level site with no parent. When they do this,
   the parent receives instructions to eliminate that site and all its
   children from its hierarchy tree. The primary site can then reattach
   to a different parent, if needed. The primary Site can also simply
   switch to a new parent site in one operation.

<P><LI>Secondary sites are deleted through their parent site. The site is
   physically deinstalled when this happens.

<P><LI>The structure of  the site tree can be altered by changing parent
   site codes for the various sites. A primary site can detach from
   its current parent and attach to a new one or become independent,
   as stated in rule number four above. Secondary sites can also have
   their parent code altered to another site. While this is technically
   possible, this usage is not officially supported in Systems
   Management Server  1.0.
