The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Systems Management Server on a drive that
has the Administrator share deleted, Systems Management Server installs a
site that has most subdirectories missing, and Setup does not report any
errors. This results in an unusable Systems Management Server site.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Systems Management Server Setup and the Systems Management Server services
require that the Administrative drive shares (such as C$) exist on a server
before Systems Management Server is installed. These shares are installed
by default by LAN Manager and Windows NT.
<P>
Systems Management Server Setup begins installation and creates part of the
directory structure on the target drive. Systems Management Server then
starts the SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER service which completes the
installation. The service attempts to look for the UNC name \\&lt;server
name&gt;\&lt;drive&gt;$ to complete the installation. If this share doesn't exist,
an error will be reported in the SCMAN.LOG file but the site does not
complete the installation.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The drive administrative shares will be recreated the next time you reboot
of the system or you can manually recreate the shares. In order to recover
from the damaged Systems Management Server installation, use Systems
Management Server Setup to remove the site and then reinstall it from the
beginning.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
