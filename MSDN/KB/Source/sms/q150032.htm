The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using a 16-bit Windows client and running a shared application
such as Microsoft Word or Excel, and you close the application and
immediately log off without exiting Windows, you may after a short time
receive the following error message from Program Group Control:
<P>
<PRE>   You have just logged off with shared applications running. Log back on
   and close your shared applications.

</PRE>The message is incorrect because there are no shared applications running.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Every 60 seconds, Program Group Control checks on the status of the shared
applications. It goes down its Task List incrementing a variable for each
running application and checking to see if that application is still
running. If the application is not running, Program Group Control removes
it from its Task List but does not decrement the variable. Therefore, the
count it keeps of running applications is incorrect for the first check
after an application has been closed. The count is corrected on the second
check, 60 seconds later.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Wait at least one minute after closing the last open shared application
before logging off, if you do not intend to exit Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
