The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Several TMP files exist on the Microsoft Systems Management Server logon
servers in the Logon.srv\Inventry.box subdirectory. These TMP files may
have an old time stamp and may appear to be stranded files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Normally TMP files are created by Systems Management Server client
computers on logon servers. When taking the client's inventory, the
Inventory Agent component running on Systems Management Server client
computers creates these TMP files on the logon server in the
Logon.srv\Inventry.box subdirectory. After the inventory process is
completed the TMP files should be renamed with the RAW file name extension.
If clients only have Add and Read permissions to this directory and not
Change permissions, the TMP file is not renamed with the RAW extension and
is stranded.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this issue, ensure that all Systems Management Server
clients (Everyone) has the default Change permissions at the directory
level for all the logon server's Logon.srv\Inventry.box subdirectory.
<P>
Please refer to the "BackOffice Resource Kit 1", Chapter 1, page 27 for a
complete list of default directory permissions.
<P>
If you have old stranded TMP files on your logon servers, you can move them
to a temporary location and delete them later, if they are still not
required. Restart the Systems Management Server Executive service on the
site server after moving these files, so that the Maintenance Manager
thread is restarted.
<P>
The Systems Management Server Maintenance Manager service monitors all the
logon server's Logon.srv\Inventry.box subdirectory for RAW files and moves
them to the site server's Site.srv\Inventry.box subdirectory. Sometimes the
Maintenance Manager service may seem to stop responding if there are
several thousand .TMP files in the Logon.srv\Inventry.box subdirectory.
<P>
This problem may also occur when network connectivity problems exist
between the clients' computer and its logon server. This causes the
inventory agent to start the inventory process, create a TMP file, and then
disconnect because of the network problem which leaves the 0 byte TMP file
stranded. The inventory agent loops through this process over and over
again, thereby causing many TMP files to be created (usually with a 0 byte
size) and then stranded in the Logon.srv\Inventry.box subdirectory.
