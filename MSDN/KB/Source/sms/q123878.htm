<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you follow the process for adding or removing a domain or site from a
Systems Management Server Primary Site, you may see warnings
indicating that sites, addresses, or machines are inconsistent with the
database.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The following situations can cause these messages:

<UL><LI>A client machine is moved from one primary site database to
   another primary site database. When this happens the "losing"
   site database is not informed. This constitutes an "orphan"
   machine, and since the possibility exists that the entire
   domain was moved to a new site, a warning may be issued. If
   you do not want the machine movement, you (as the administrator),
   can increase the FalseLogonThreshold parameter in the registry.
   Movement from a secondary site to a parent site does not cause
   a problem because the existing machine inventory is updated with
   a new site code/domain name.

<LI>A child site detaches or is otherwise removed (secondary site)
   from the current site. When this happens the machine inventory
   is left behind. This is similar to the following situation.

<LI>One or more of the current site's domains are removed using
   the Site Properties &lt;Domains&gt; dialog. When this happens the machine
   inventory is left behind. Because the machine inventory is keyed to the
   Site/Domain combination, a warning appears when this combination is no
   longer valid.

<LI>Sites exist in the database which are not addressable (no
   sender address has been created). Also, when a site detaches, the
   parent's address to the child is automatically removed, but the
   inventory remains.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct the database and prevent these message pop-ups, use a query
to bring up a list of candidate machines to be manually deleted. The
query dialog can be used to specify a particular site code, domain
name, and so forth. In the case of site address messages, an address will
need to be created, or the ghost site can be removed with the PREINST
/DELSITE command (see the Admin documentation for the Site Hierarchy
Manager command-line syntax).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
