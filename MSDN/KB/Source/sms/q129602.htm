<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Systems Management Server uses SMSWORK to do any work that was queued by
Systems Management Server before the computer was rebooted. This allows
Systems Management Server to execute a program before anything else has
been started. This is usually done to reconfigure an operating system
during an upgrade, but could be used for anything that needs to be
accomplished during start up.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
SMSWORK is run from CLIENT.BAT, which is called from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
(as setup by Systems Management Server during the SMS configuration
process). SMSWORK looks in the C:\SMS.INI file for the PendingWork key and
executes any command found there. Once this command is executed, the line
is cleared so the command is not executed the next time the system is
started.
<P>
<P><h3>SMS 1.0a Release Notes on SMSWORK</h3>
 
<P>
SMS uses a program called SMSWORK.EXE to queue work to be done after a
system reboot. SMSWORK is used to do any general work that cannot be done
at the time a command is executing, for instance the Operating System Setup
Encapsulation programs use SMSWORK to remove or replace files and
directories at reboot time.
<P>
SMSWORK.EXE looks in the SMS.INI file for the section [SMS Work] and the
key PendingWork. The key value is a single command line or a series of
comma-delimited command-lines, for example:
<P>
PendingWork=Echo Please wait while SMS removes an SMS created temp
directory, DEL c:\SMSTMP SMSWORK is invoked by CLIENT.BAT on MS DOS,
Windows, and OS/2 SMS clients. On Windows NT computers SMSRUN32 performs
these functions.
