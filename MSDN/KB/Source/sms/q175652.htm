The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Systems Management Server Package Command Manager (PCM) may fail to change
the completion status of a package command when the command executed causes
a system shutdown.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Systems Management Server PCM changes package command completion status
when the command has completed execution. PCM determines that a command has
executed by periodically checking the process handle from the command
executed until it is no longer running. If the system is shut down before
the process handle can be checked, PCM updates the completion status after
receiving the WM_ENDSESSION message that was sent to all applications that
were running during a "graceful" shutdown.
<P>
Systems Management Server PCM will fail to change the completion status of
an executed job if the application installed issues a "harsh" system
shutdown. Applications that use the ExitWindowsEX() call with the
EWX_REBOOT and EWX_FORCE flags issue a "harsh" system shutdown.
<P>
The reason Systems Management Server PCM cannot change the job status
during a "harsh" shutdown is that the EWX_FORCE flag does not send the
windows messages WM_QUERYENDSESSION and WM_ENDSESSION, to applications that
are running. Without the WM_ENDSESSION message, Systems Management Server
PCM does not detect that it is about to be terminated. Because Systems
Management Server PCM relies on the WM_ENDSESSION message to detect
termination and change the package command completion status, the status is
never changed from pending to executed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P>
Systems Management Server PCM was modified to change the job completion
status when an application that requires a system shutdown has been
successfully started. This change requires that packages must be created on
the server using a package definition file (PDF) with the entry
SynchronousSystemExitRequired=TRUE.
<P>
For information about how to create PDF files and use the
SynchronousSystemExitRequired entry, refer to the Microsoft BackOffice
Resource Kit, Microsoft Systems Management Server Resource Guide, Chapter
4.
<P>
For information about installing PDF files, see your Microsoft Systems
Management Server documentation.
<P>
An example PDF file is included below:

SupportedPlatforms=Windows95
<P>
<P>
Obtain one of the following files, as appropriate for the version of the
operating system that you are running, or you can wait for the next Systems
Management Server service pack. To ensure that you have the correct version
of the file, make sure that the files have the following timestamps:
<P>
<PRE>   Pcmwin16.exe  12/04/97  04:04
   Pcmwin32.exe  12/04/97  04:03

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
