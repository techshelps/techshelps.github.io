The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server, versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the past, the Package Command Manager (PCM) has been installed as a
service (Pcmsvc32.exe) on Systems Management Server logon servers, but only
as an application (Pcmwin32.exe) on Systems Management Server Windows NT
clients. Because the client version runs as an application, packages that
are run from PCM are run in the security context of the currently logged-on
user.
<P>
You can now install PCM as a service on any computer running Windows NT
Workstation or Windows NT Server stand-alone (Intel or Alpha) that is a
member of a Windows NT Server domain and is a Systems Management Server 1.2
client. In addition to the new Pcmsvc.exe file, the Pcmwin32.exe file has
been changed and will need to be replaced on the client computers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The PCM service requires a user account that has:

<UL><LI>Administrator privileges on the client computer.

<LI>Domain user authority to read a PCM instruction file on the Systems
   Management Server logon server and to run a setup program in the package
   directory on the Systems Management Server distribution server.
<P>
</UL>Because it works through a user account with administrative privileges, the
PCM service can perform tasks that the PCM application cannot. For example,
it can install files into secured directories or make changes to secured
registry keys.
<P>
You can download installation instructions and file updates on the
following Microsoft Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt">http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt</A></B>

</PRE>On the Web site, select "Download &amp; Trial", then "PCM as a Service."
<P>
Please review the Readme.txt and Install.doc files included with
the download completely before updating the PCM service.
