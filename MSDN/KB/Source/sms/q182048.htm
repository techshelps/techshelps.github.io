The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2
</UL> 
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If any primary site has more than 1,800 sites reporting to it, the Systems
Management Server Administrator program displays the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Some machines in your database are associated with sites or domains that
   do not appear in your Sites tree. The missing items are listed below.

</PRE>This message includes a list of everything the Systems Management Server
Administrator program cannot address.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To install this hotfix, perform the steps below. Note that this procedure
involves editing the system registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

<OL><P><LI>Stop all SMS services.

<P><LI>Rename the existing Sms.exe file to Sms.old (this file will most likely
   be located in either the Sms\Site.srv\X86.bin or Sms\Site.srv\Alpha.bin
   directories).

<P><LI>Copy the new (hotfix) version of Sms.exe to the directory the existing
   Sms.exe file was located in.

<P><LI>Start the Systems Management Server Administrator program.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click Save Settings Now (this creates the SuppressMissingAddressDialog
   value in the AppSettings key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER in the system
   registry).

<P><LI>Start RegEdt32.exe.

<P><LI>Navigate to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Main\AppSettings
</PRE>
<P><LI>Change SuppressMissingAddressDialog value from 0 to 1.

<P><LI>Close and reopen the Systems Management Server Administrator program.
