The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Package Command Manager (PCM) service (Pcmsvc32.exe) is installed by
default on Systems Management Server logon servers. With updates for
Systems Management Server 1.2, is also possible to install the service on
computers running Windows NT Workstation and member servers. You can find
information and updates for the PCM service for computers running Windows
NT Workstation at <B><A HREF="http://microsoft.com/smsmgmt">http://microsoft.com/smsmgmt,</A></B> as well as in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Installation instructions and file updates should be downloaded from
<B><A HREF="http://backoffice.microsoft.com/downtrial/moreinfo/pcm.asp">http://backoffice.microsoft.com/downtrial/moreinfo/pcm.asp.</A></B> Please review
the Readme.txt and Install.doc files included with the download completely
before updating the PCM service.
<P>
There are several steps necessary to ensure that a package is received by
the PCM service and that it runs correctly. This article summarizes the
package and job requirements, and makes recommendations to ensure
successful package deployment with the PCM service. This article assumes
you have read the Install.doc and Readme.txt files included with the PCM
service update available on the Internet.
<P>
<P><h3>Summary of PCM Service Requirements</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>The package must be run "silently" with no user input required.

<P><LI>The package command line must be designated as an "Automated Command
   Line" and a System (Background) Task in the package properties.

<P><LI>The job must be sent as mandatory, and will be run at the "Mandatory
   After" time.

<P><LI>The PCM service must be properly installed, configured, and running on
   the target computer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Recommended Steps to Include with PCM Service Distributions</h3>
 
<P>
Preparation:

<OL><P><LI>Ensure the that target computer running Windows NT Workstation is in
   Systems Management Server inventory, and that the inventory is current.

<P><LI>Ensure that the PCM Polling Interval (on the Site Properties menu, click
   Clients) is set to 20 minutes or greater. If it is set to less than 20
   minutes, the next time the PCM service checks the .ins file, the status
   MIF may not have been processed, and the package will run again.

<P><LI>Familiarize yourself with product documentation and readme files
   included with the application you want to deploy.

<P><LI>Ensure that the application can be installed correctly in the context
   of the service account. Refer to the PCM service update Install.doc file
   for more information.

<P><LI>Ensure that the target computer has been properly backed-up (including
   the Windows NT Workstation registry, files and directories, and disk
   partition information).

<P><LI>Ensure that the target servers are running the correct version of the
   PCM service (check the file date in the Sms\Helper.srv directory).
<P>
</OL>Package Creation:

<OL><P><LI>In the Command Line Properties dialog box, make sure you have designated
   the command line as an "Automated Command Line".

<P><LI>In the Command Line Properties dialog box, make sure you have designated
   the command line as a System (Background) Task.

<P><LI>In the Command Line Properties dialog box, make sure that the correct
   operating system platform is checked for Supported Platforms.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Pcmwin32.exe (the PCM application) does not attempt to run the
package if it is designated as a Background Task, and the Pcmwin.log file
will resemble the following:

</PRE></OL>Job Creation:

<OL><P><LI>In the Job Details dialog box, ensure that the Package Name, Job
   Target, Send Phase and Distribute Phase are set according to your needs.

<P><LI>In the Job Details dialog box under Run Phase, click the Run Workstation
   Command check box, and select the appropriate Workstation Command Line.

<P><LI>In the Job Details dialog box under Run Phase, ensure the Offer After
   date is correct.

<P><LI>In the Job Details dialog box under Run Phase, check the Mandatory
   After check box, and ensure the date is correct.

<P><LI>In the Job Details dialog box under Run Phase, ensure the Expire After
   date is correct.
<P>
</OL>On the Target Computer:

<OL><P><LI>It may be necessary to ensure no one is logged on at the target computer
   (network connections are okay). Because jobs can now be run while the
   user is logged on (or while the workstation is locked) administrators
   must be cautious of the mandatory time selected for jobs that will
   restart the system. Such jobs should be scheduled for off-hours, and
   users should be given ample time to save their work.

<P><LI>Ensure that the the PCM service is running.
