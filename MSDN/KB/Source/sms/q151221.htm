The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Remote Control may not seem to work over TCP/IP if the WINS server that the
client is reporting to is different than the WINS server that the
administrator's tool is using. This is due to the fact that the Remote
Control client does not register with the WINS server at boot but rather
when Wuser.exe is run.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the client is booted Usertsr.exe is loaded; however, the client does
not register the &lt;43h&gt; name to the WINS server at that time. Instead
Wuser.exe is relied upon to register with the WINS server. Because the
client does not report to WINS until Wuser.exe is loaded, the SMS
administrator's utility may not work until WINS replication has taken place
if the client reports to a different WINS server than the one the SMS
administrator's utility is using.
<P>
Also, when Wuser.exe is stopped, it sends a release request to the WINS
database that removes the &lt;43h&gt; entry.
