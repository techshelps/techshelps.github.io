The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
<LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, Installer version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The automated procedure for creating an installation package with the
Systems Management Server Installer is called "repackaging." The
repackaging feature of the Systems Management Server Installer allows the
administrator to install a standard application on a reference computer,
and have the installation duplicated on desktops throughout the
organization.
<P>
Repackaging begins by clicking Repackage to access the Repackage
Installation dialog box. In this dialog box, the path to the application's
Setup program is specified, along with any required command-line options.
<P>
<P><h3>Scan the Directories and Registry</h3>
 
<P>
The Systems Management Server Installer monitors drives and directories
during the repackage process. By default, the Systems Management Server
Installer automatically designates to scan the Windows NT drive and all its
subdirectories, but it is possible to remove directories from the scan. For
example, if the computer has multiple hard-disk partitions, but the
application only installs files on one partition, configure the Systems
Management Server Installer to scan only the one drive. This is done by
clicking Change in the Repackage Installation dialog box. From the
Repackage Installation dialog box, drives and directories can be configured
in the top portion of the Advanced Settings dialog box.
<P>
During the installation of the application, which is completed during the
repackage procedure, it is possible for some temporary files, such as .log
or .tmp files, to be modified. The temporary files may not be necessary for
the installation to be successful, but rather a residual effect of the
installation. The Systems Management Server Installer can be configured to
ignore the files during the scanning process. Configuration of files to be
ignored is accomplished by clicking Change in the Repackage Installation
dialog box. From the Repackage Installation dialog box, files that should
be ignored can be configured in the bottom portion of the Advanced Settings
dialog box.
<P>
The repackage process will also capture all changes made to the registry.
Special attention should be given to registry values that may change (for
example, a DHCP release and renew with a new address), and are not part of
the installation. Configure registry values to be ignored by clicking the
Change button in the Repackage Installation dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Run Installation</h3>
 
<P>
After the scanning of directories and the registry is complete, the Setup
program runs. The application should be installed and configured as
required for the end-user computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Scan the Directories and Registry Again</h3>
 
<P>
After the installation and configuration of the application, The Systems
Management Server Installer performs another scan of the configured drives
and directories, as well as the registry. An installation script is then
produced that references all the files copied, icons created, program
groups or Start menu items created, and registry entries modified.
<P>
The Systems Management Server Installer automatically scans the Windows NT
drive and all its subdirectories. These directories are displayed on the
Repackage Installation dialog box, so you only have to change it if it is
not correct. If you want to change it, click Change.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are some things to consider when repackaging an application:
<P>
<P><h3>Reference Computer</h3>
 
<P>
To ensure that a repackaged application will install correctly, your
reference (or test) computer should be as clean as possible. Many
applications share files, and if the original setup program detects these
files, it may not reinstall them. For example, if you want to repackage
Microsoft Word and you use a reference computer with Microsoft Excel on it
for your repackage, some of the shared DLL files and files in the Msapps
directory may not be installed in the repackage operation. Consequently, if
Excel is not already installed on your target computers, your repackaged
Word will not install completely, and may fail to run correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>Data Conversion</h3>
 
<P>
If the original setup program does any kind of upgrade or modification of
data files (such as user database files), the Repackager will fail to
capture the conversion. Consequently, the Systems Management Server
Installer application will not install correctly on the target computer. In
cases where data conversion occurs as part of the original setup, do not
use the Repackager feature.
<P>
<P><h3>Hardware Scans</h3>
 
<P>
If the original setup program does any kind of hardware detection, a
repackaged Systems Management Server Installer application may fail.
<P>
<P><h3>Shared Network Files</h3>
 
<P>
If the original setup program makes any modifications to shared or network
files, special consideration should be given to the Repackager setup. If
the Repackager makes modifications to shared files, the installation will
probably fail. If the Repackager references network files, the installation
may fail. Extra testing should be performed to ensure that the repackage
will run on all clients and under all logon names.
