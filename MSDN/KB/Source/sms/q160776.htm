The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Machine inventory records do not receive updates in the Systems Management
Server database. You may be notice this problem after recently distributing
a custom MIF form to clients.
<P>
This problem can also be verified by examining the Invproc.log file,
located in the Logs directory of the client's site server. A "Compilation
failed" entry will appear immediately after "Processing Machine ISV MIF
Files."
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Systems Management Server Inventory Processor is rejecting RAW files
because one or more custom MIF attribute names contains a trailing space.
This is generally caused when you generate the custom MIF form with the
Systems Management Server MIF Form Generator (MIFGEN), and a space is
accidentally added to the end of a field name.
<P>
You can check whether there is a trailing space character by examining the
custom MIF file output by the MIF Entry Form (MIFWIN). The following sample
section of a custom MIF output contains a space after the PC Asset Number,
and would therefore cause the Inventory Processor to fail compilation:
<P>
<PRE>   Start Attribute
         Name = "PC Asset Number "
         ID = 1
         Type = String(35)
         Storage = Specific
         Value = "2485798"
   End Attribute

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Reload the custom MIF form into the MIFGEN utility.

<P><LI>Edit the offending field identified as having trailing spaces in the
   MIF, typing the item name again, with no trailing space.

<P><LI>As a test, place the XNF file in the Ms\Sms\Bin directory of a client.
   Remove the .sev and .mif files from the Noidmifs directory for the XNF
   name (if the XNF file was previously distributed to the client).

<P><LI>Before redistributing the XNF file to clients, or as part of the
   distribution process, you must remove the .sev and .mif files for the
   named XNF from the client's Noidmifs directory. Failure to do so will
   produce a "Form template file is corrupted" error message from MIFWIN on
   the client.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
