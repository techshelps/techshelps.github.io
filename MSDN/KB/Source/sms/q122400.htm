<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 was not designed to
share documents that were associated with Systems Management Server shared
applications. For example, by current design, a Systems Management Server
shared version of Microsoft Word (MSWord) cannot open a Systems Management
Server shared document. The following error message
usually appears in this situation:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to open file &lt;filename&gt;.

</PRE>This happens whenever a drive letter is required. With Windows NT systems,
using the Runs With UNC Name attribute allows the document to load
properly.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Any Systems Management Server shared program item requires the Appstart
utility (APPSTART) to be ran. If a shared program item has a command line
like SHAREME.DOC, and Requires Drive Letter is specified, Systems
Management Server is unable to open the document file.
<P>
This is because APPSTART is ran twice during the process; first to launch
SHAREME.DOC, and second to launch MSWord. APPSTART then quits the first
instance of itself and continues. This removes the first environment and
the associated drive letter assigned to the SHAREME.DOC path.
<P>
For example, APPSTART assigns a driver letter &lt;G:&gt;, and runs
G:\SHAREME.DOC. Windows then associates the *.DOC file with MSWord and
attempts to launch it. If a Systems Management Server version of MSWord is
installed on the system, Windows then launches APPSTART a second time to
start the shared version of MSWord. APPSTART detects that it is already
running and shuts down the first instance, removing the drive connection to
SHAREME.DOC. APPSTART then connects a new drive letter &lt;H:&gt; for MSWord and
runs the command line H:\WINWORD.EXE G:\SHAREME.DOC. Because drive G has
been disconnected by APPSTART, MSWord generates an error message that the
file could not be opened.
<P>
A partial workaround is to configure the shared document with the Runs With
UNC Name attribute, and distribute to Windows NT and Windows 95 clients
only. Like the above scenario, the second instance of APPSTART quits the
first instance, removing the drive location. However, Windows NT and
Windows 95 allow universal naming convention (UNC) network path names, and
when MSWord runs, the command line is:
<P>
<PRE>   H:\WINWORD \\&lt;SMS Server&gt;\SHAREME.DOC.

</PRE>This forces Windows NT and Windows 95 to open a new UNC connection to the
SHAREME.DOC.
