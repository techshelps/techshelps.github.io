<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
You can run shared applications from Systems Management Server
version 1.0 by using the Appstart program to select an appropriate
application server. There are three ways Appstart locates a server (in
order):

<UL><LI>Existing Share
<LI>Existing Server
<LI>Random
<P>
</UL><h3>Existing Share</h3>
 
<P>
If an existing connection to a needed share exists, Appstart piggy-backs or
reuses the existing share connection. Appstart assumes that a previous
attempt to connect was made, and, during that attempt, these same rules
were followed. This is done to maximize load balancing on the initial
connection, and minimize the total number of distinct connections a client
makes.
<P>
<P><h3>Existing Server</h3>
 
<P>
If there is already a session established with the server providing the
desired share and a connection to the share does not already exist,
Appstart connects to this server and share. Quite often a local connection
will exist to the SMS Windows NT logon server (and SMS_SHR) that
authenticated the logon. For this reason, the majority of Appstart requests
will go to a Windows NT (or LAN Manager) domain controller local to the
client computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Random</h3>
 
<P>
If no shares or servers are connected that have the desired resources,
Appstart will randomly pick from the list in the network accounts database
(NAD).
<P>
Random selection is rarely performed after either the existing share or
server methods have been used. They are oriented to the local subnet, while
the random method acts as a safety net. The random selection will most
likely be made on the local subnet, but it cannot be guaranteed in SMS
version 1.0. That is why the existing share and server methods are
attempted first. To ensure a local connection, you can add a NET USE
command to a local distribution server in the logon script. Then you
guarantee a session because Appstart will always check for an existing
server before choosing randomly.
