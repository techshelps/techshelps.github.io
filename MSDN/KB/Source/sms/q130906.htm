<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Site Configuration Manager component for Systems Management Server
performs numerous operations during its "watchdog" cycle. This article
describes four stages of the cycle. Each stage, as it is performed, can be
monitored via the service trace log file (SCMAN.LOG) for Site Configuration
Manager located in the root directory of the drive that Systems Management
Server is installed in.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Stage 1</h3>
 
<P>
1a. Calculate if intervals have timed out for logon scripts, status file or
<PRE>    user group mif.

</PRE>1b. Write site identification information to registry.
<P>
1c. Write domains and logon servers to registry.
<P>
1d. Write site account, addresses, outboxes, misc config information to the
<PRE>    registry.

</PRE>1e. Write SQL Server information to registry.
<P>
NOTE: Steps 1b through 1e are only performed if a site control image
(*.CT1) file is detected. The alternative is that the Site Configuration
Manager woke up due to a polling interval, and there is no *.CT1 file
present.
<P>
<P><h3>Stage 2</h3>
 
<P>
The Site Configuration Manager reads the list of domains for the site
(found in the registry) and for each domain, it enumerates the servers to
find all logon servers. The logon servers are added to the registry and are
marked as pending-install if they are new.
<P>
<P><h3>Stage 3</h3>
 
<P>
The Site Configuration Manager now uses the registry as the definition for
the site installation and verifies that the actual installation of domains
and components exist as defined. It removes any domains, servers, or
components that are marked as pending-uninstall and installs any that are
marked as pending install. For any that are marked as active, it verifies
the installation.
<P>
<P><h3>Stage 4</h3>
 
<P>
The Site Configuration Manager reports the installation status of the site
by writing a site control file (*.CT2) and sending this file back to the
Hierarchy Manager. If this site was installed remotely, a mini-job is used
to send the file to the parent.
