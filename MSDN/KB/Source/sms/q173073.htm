The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Under various circumstances, you may see a message box titled
<P>
<PRE>   Package Command Manager Service

</PRE>which contains the following text:
<P>
<PRE>   A package is currently being installed in the background.
   This is routine, however please wait until it has completed
   before starting any new packages.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This message appears when Pcmwin32 fails to get control of the semaphore
from Pcmsvc32. This message usually appears when Pcmsvc32 is processing a
job and Pcmwin32 tries to go through its normal polling cycle. This message
may also appear if a user tries to start Pcmwin32 manually while Pcmsvc32
is processing a job. Note that there are reports of this message appearing
when Pcmsvc32 was not processing a job. Many of these reports seem to
indicate that underlying networking problems or unavailable Systems
Management Server logon servers cause this message to appear.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Many customers have asked that the message referenced in the Symptoms
section be completely removed or that the ability to turn the message off
and on by using a registry switch be included. The message serves a very
useful purpose and cannot be removed. However, changes were made to
Pcmsvc32.exe, so that the semaphore is only used when necessary.
Pcmsvc32.exe only takes ownership of the mutex after a Systems Management
Server logon server has been validated. This change should prevent the
message from displaying when underlying networking problems occur or the
Systems Management Server logon servers are unavailable.
