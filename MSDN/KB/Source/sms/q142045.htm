The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An ACC Nile router (with no filtering) is running IPX over a token-ring
network (a non-NetWare network). Both a Systems Management Server and a
Windows for Workgroups computer are using the IPX/SPX compatible transport
protocol (NWLink) to communicate. However, if a Windows for Workgroups
computer is not on the same ring as the Systems Management Server, remote
control does not work. The Windows for Workgroups computer can properly
connect to computers on the same, far side of the router, but cannot
connect to computers across the router.
<P>
NOTE: Although this article mentions an ACC Nile router running IPX over
token ring, this symptom also applies to other routers.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the Windows for Workgroups computer is not
responding to the NBIPX Find Name requests sent by the Systems Management
Server across the router. The Systems Management Server is not able to
remote control or connect to the Windows for Workgroups computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, use an ACC Nile router command that changes the
IPX network functional address to FFFFFFFFFFFF from the default token-ring
address of C00000800000. The default address that the router port uses to
send IPX broadcast packets in an ethernet network is FFFFFFFFFFFF.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
On the same side of the router, the Systems Management Server sends a
request packet using the MAC destination address of FFFFFFFFFFFF to a
Windows for Workgroups computer. However, the Systems Management Server
across the router sends the MAC destination address of C00000800000, which
the Windows for Workgroups computer on the other side of the router
ignores. A Windows 95 computer accepts either one of addresses.
