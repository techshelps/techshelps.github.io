The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When attempting to run the Audit package on a Windows NT client, the
following Audit32.exe application error is produced:
<P>
<PRE>   The instruction as "0x00000000" referenced memory at "0x00000000". The
   memory could not be read.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During the execution of Audit32.exe, the program attempts to make a call to
the Ismif32.dll file, which is located in the SystemRoot directory. This
file is used to produce a status MIF for the Audit program. If the
Ismif32.dll file cannot be found, an access violation (AV) is produced.
<P>
There are two situations in which the Ismif32.dll file will not be present:

<UL><LI>The Ismif32.dll file may not be present if the Package Command Manager
   (PCM) has been disabled in the client's site properties. This may be
   where the PCM service is in use on a Windows NT client, and PCMWIN32
   does not require distribution by means of Systems Management Server
   client setup. ISMIF32 requires Package Command Manager to be enabled in
   the client site properties.

<LI>The Ismif32.dll file may not be present if a Systems Management Server
   site or logon server has not previously run the Systems Management
   Server script file Smsls.bat or Runsms.bat. In such a case, the Systems
   Management Server client components will not have been installed.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do any one of the following:

<UL><LI>Copy the Ismif32.dll and Ismif16.dll files into the &lt;platform.bin&gt;
   directory (for example, either the x86.bin, mips.bin, or alpha.bin
   directory) of the Audit package source, and resend the audit package to
   clients with the send option 'Even if previously sent' and the
   distribute option 'Refresh existing distribution servers' checked.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If the Clients Site Property for PCM is disabled, enable the property by
   checking the Package Command Manager option in the Clients window of the
   Site Properties.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If a site or logon server exhibits the failure, manually run Runsms.bat
   from the server's own SMS_SHR.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Manager Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
