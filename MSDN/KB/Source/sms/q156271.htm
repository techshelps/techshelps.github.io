The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
An installation script is required for "Run Command on Workstation"
packages, if the executable file specified in the Package Command Line
terminates after calling a second executable file that relies on accessing
the package share location to continue.
<P>
Many applications run a setup program, and the original executable (such as
Setup.exe) does not keep running throughout the duration of setup. When
creating a "Run Command on Workstation" package, the executable file to run
is specified. When the workstation receives that package, and the Package
Command Manager (PCM) goes to run it, PCM does a NET USE to the package
share location. As soon as the original executable file is finished
running, PCM deletes the share. If the executable file spawned another
executable file before it closed, the second application will fail if it
relies on the source share. The error messages that may result from this
problem vary from application to application. PCM will report in the
Pcmwin.log file that the package ran successfully.
<P>
There may or may not be error messages when the installation fails,
depending on the setup application. The following are examples of common
error messages or problems that may be encountered:

<UL><LI>"Insert Disk 16 in Drive N:"

<LI>"Unable to read from Drive N:"

<LI>"Disk Error Drive/on Device N:"

<LI>"Error reading Drive N"

<LI>"Error opening file XXX"

<LI>"Error in script line 123 - cannot open media script file"

<LI>Buttons or windows may be blank or not drawn correctly

<LI>The system stops responding
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>If the application to be installed is an MS-DOS-based application, or a
   Windows-based application on a client computer running Windows NT, it
   may be possible to create a batch file containing the command for the
   setup executable file, and then use the batch file as the command line
   when creating the package.

<LI>If the application is a 16-bit application for a computer running
   Windows 3.1, Windows NT, or Windows 95, use Execute.exe to run a two-
   phase setup program under the PCM program. Execute.exe is provided with
   the Systems Management Server 1.2 Resource Kit, and requires a basic
   understanding of Visual C++.

<LI>Copy the source files to the local hard drive, before launching setup.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MSTest is not the only option for writing an installation script for "Run
Command on Workstation" packages. There are other options, such as using
InstallShield or WINInstall, Visual Basic, C, or even Visual Test (for
client computers running Windows NT only).
<P>
NOTE: If the entire setup program runs from a single executable file (many
programs do), it is not necessary to write an installation script at all.
<P>
The following are some third-party applications that can be used to write
an installation script:

<LI>Visual Test by Microsoft Corporation

<LI>InstallShield by Installshield Corporation

<LI>WINInstall by Seagate (formerly OnDemand Software)

<LI>WinBatch by Wilson WindowWare

<LI>LAN Script by ABC Systems
