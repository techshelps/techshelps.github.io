<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides a brief overview of 32-bit Program Group Control
(PGC) for Windows 95 clients in Systems Management Server 1.2.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In previous versions of Systems Management Server, PGC monitored and
reconfigured Windows registry settings each time an application was
launched using the Appstart functionality of PGC. This was done so that PGC
would be able to provide dynamic server selection at launch time. For this
to work, a special application (called Smssetup.exe) was required to
perform these changes. This implementation proved to be difficult to
support, and a better solution now exists for Windows 95.
<P>
Under Windows 95, Program Group Control performs server name substitution
at the file system level instead of reconfiguring the application at launch
time. The application gets installed normally, and then when it tries to
use any of its components, PGC recognizes that the application was
installed from a Systems Management Server package, connects to the Systems
Management Server share point at the file system level, and then the
application can access the necessary files. This functionality is only
available to applications that are capable of running from a UNC path (for
example, \\servername\sharepoint).
<P>
The Systems Management Server Router technology (Program Group Control's
file system redirection capability) is implemented as a VxD file system
driver called Smsroutr.vxd. Applications that use the Systems Management
Server Router technology only deliver the application's setup icon to the
user's desktop. After the user installs the application from the icon
delivered by Systems Management Server, the application should be run from
the icons created by the setup program. Choosing the Systems Management
Server-delivered icon will only reinstall the application.
<P>
The implementation of Program Group Control for Windows NT clients has
always been 32-bit, but its functionality is identical to that of the
16-bit PGC that runs on Windows 3.x clients. The new functionality of PGC
under Windows 95 is not available to Windows NT clients using Systems
Management Server. Windows NT clients run the shared application
successfully, but only from the server that the application was installed
from. Therefore, load balancing and fault tolerance will not be available
for Windows NT clients.
<P>
<P><h3>NETWORK NAMING PROVIDER</h3>
 
<P>
Network Naming Provider (NNP) is a system application (running at Ring 3)
that provides the non-real time component of the Systems Management Server
Router. NNP loads at boot time, reads the system registry for Systems
Management Server information, formats that information, and passes it to
the Logical Network Redirector (LNR). In addition, NNP verifies server and
share status as needed, and updates the information for LNR.
<P>
<P><h3>LOGICAL NETWORK REDIRECTOR</h3>
 
<P>
Logical Network Redirector (LNR) is a Windows 95 system VxD (running at
Ring 0) that contains the real-time portion of Systems Management Server
Router. LNR loads at startup, hooks the installable file system (IFS)
manager, and is transparent to user applications. LNR is used to monitor
appropriate file operations for accesses to Systems Management Server
controlled resources and when necessary to redirect operations that fail to
an alternate path. In addition, LNR does load leveling on the initial use
of a share.
