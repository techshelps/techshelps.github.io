The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to run the Audit package on a client computer running
Windows NT, you receive the following Audit32.exe application error:
<P>
<PRE>   The instruction as "0x00000000" referenced memory at "0x00000000". The
   memory could not be read.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Audit32.exe attempts to make a call to Ismif32.dll, located in the
SystemRoot directory. Ismif32.dll is used to produce a status MIF for the
Audit program. If Audit32 cannot find Ismif32.dll, this error message
occurs.
<P>
The Ismif32.dll file will not be present if:

<UL><LI>The Package Command Manager (PCM) has been disabled. This option may
   have been disabled by clicking Clients under Site Properties. This may
   be where the PCM Service is in use on a Windows NT client and PCMWIN32
   does not require distribution by means of Systems Management Server
   client setup. Ismif32.dll depends on Package Command Manager being
   enabled in the client site properties.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>A Windows NT Systems Management Server site server or logon server has
   not previously run the Systems Management Server script files Smsls.bat
   or Runsms.bat. If not, the Systems Management Server client components
   will not have been installed.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Copy the Ismif32.dll and Ismif16.dll files into the &lt;platform.bin&gt;
   directory (for example, X86.bin, Mips.bin, or Alpha.bin) of the Audit
   package source, and resend the audit package to clients with the send
   option 'Even if previously sent' and the distribute option 'Refresh
   existing distribution servers' checked.

<LI>If the client's Site Property for PCM is disabled, enable the property
   by checking the Package Command Manager option within the Clients
   window of the Site Properties.

<LI>If a site or logon server has this problem, manually run Runsms.bat from
   the server's own SMS_SHR.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Manager Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
