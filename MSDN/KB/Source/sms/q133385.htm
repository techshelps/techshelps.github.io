<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.20
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Because the Systems Management Server Executive is a wrapper containing the
actual Systems Management Server services for many functions in the Site,
they are run as threads and are, therefore, not subject to many of the
convenient Performance Monitor (PERFMON.EXE) features available to process-
level statistics.
<P>
This article describes how to monitor each thread for certain counters and
how to isolate performance issues within the Executive.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To use Performance Monitor and the Windows NT Registry Editor to monitor
and isolate Systems Management Server Executive performance issues to
certain threads:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Run Performance Monitor, and for the Object Thread, select
   %Processor Time, ID Thread, and all SMS_EXEC instances.

<P><LI>Monitor each thread's %Processor Time and identify the instance
   number in Performance Monitor for the thread that takes the most
   processor time.

<P><LI>Find the ID Thread item that has the same instance number as the thread
   you identified in step 2 and select this ID Thread with the mouse.
   Note that its Last and Average status indicators have the same value.
   This value is the decimal thread ID.

<P><LI>Convert the decimal thread ID to a hexadecimal (hex) number to get the
   Windows NT thread ID for that SMS Component thread of the Executive.

<P><LI>Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).
<P>
   a. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:
<P>
<PRE>         \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS_EXECUTIVE\Threads

   b. Compare the thread ID of each component to the hex number from
      step 4.

      If they match, you have found the SMS Executive thread component
      responsible for the %Processor Time usage identified in Perfmon.

</PRE></OL><h3>More Troubleshooting Tips</h3>
 
<P>
To watch each task the identified thread component performs and the
associated %Processer Time usage, use the SMSTrace tool and monitor the
component log file beside the Performance Monitor window. When the log file
goes idle, expect the %Processer Time usage of the component's thread to go
idle also.
<P>
To learn about other statistics of the thread, look at additional counters,
for example, %User Time, etc.
