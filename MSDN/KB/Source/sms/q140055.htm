<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1
- Microsoft Windows 95
- Microsoft Office 95
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Systems Management Server 1.1 can be used to automate the
installation of Microsoft Office 95 to Windows 95 and Windows NT clients.
Microsoft Office 95 ships with a Package Definition File (PDF) for this
purpose.
<P>
NOTE: This PDF is not included on the Systems Management Server 1.1 CD-ROM.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The information below is designed to supplement the information in Appendix
D of the "Systems Management Server Administrator's Guide".
<P>
Installing Office 95 via SMS is a 3 step process:

<OL><P><LI>Creating an Administrative Source Share for Office 95
</OL>2. Creating and Distributing the Office 95 Package Using the PDF
3. Installing on the Client Computers
<P>
<P><h3>Creating the Administrative Installation Point</h3>
 
<P>
To create the administrative installation point, you run SETUP.EXE from the
physical media with the /a command line option. You need to run
administrative Setup under Windows 95, Windows NT Workstation 3.51 (or
later), or Windows NT Server 3.51 (or later).
<P>
The administrative installation point must have at least 180 MB of disk
space, and you (the administrator) must have read, write, delete, and
create permission to this location. Because you will be distributing this
using SMS, the SMS service account needs at least Read access. If your
users will be running shared copies of Office 95 then they will also need
read access to the source location in addition to the package shares that
SMS will create. If your users will be running in a shared Windows
environment, you need to run Setup in that same environment and you need
Write and Create permissions to the Windows folders.
<P>
Using the administrative mode of Setup, install all of the Office files
from the CD or floppy disks to the administrative installation point. This
consists of two primary folders which are created by Setup:

<OL><P><LI>\MSOFFICE - The main Office application files, such as Microsoft Word
   and Microsoft Excel will be installed in this folder.

<P><LI>\MSAPPS - Shared components, such as Art Gallery and Word Art, are
<P><PRE>    installed in this folder.
</PRE><P>
</OL>NOTE: If you are already distributing 16-bit Office applications, do not
install 32-bit MSAPPS to the same directory as the 16-bit MSApps. Create a
new directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Administrative Installation</h3>
 
<P>
Before doing the administrative installation of Office, make sure:

<UL><LI>Destination folders are empty. If a previous version of Office exists in
   the destination folder, delete all of it or choose new folders.

<LI>Users sharing applications or running shared Windows from this server
   are logged off.

<LI>Folders are locked to network user access during administrative
   installation.

<LI>Virus detection software is disabled.
<P>
</UL>To install Office on the administrative installation point:

<OL><P><LI>Run SETUP.EXE from the CD-ROM or floppy disk with the command line
   switch "/a". For example "SETUP.EXE /A". SETUP.EXE must be run from a
   workstation with Write access to the server, not directly on the server
   itself.
<P>
   NOTE: Double-clicking on SETUP.EXE in the File Manager (Windows NT) or
   Explorer (Windows 95) does not work. You must use the Run command on the
   File menu of Program Manager or File Manager (Windows NT), or the Run
   command in the Start menu (Windows 95) to use the command line option
   "/a". If you double-click on SETUP.EXE it performs a client
   installation.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions on the screen.
<P>
   NOTES:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - The organization name you enter is used for all client installations
      of Office from this network location.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - When asked for the server and path for the shared applications
      folder, enter the name in the same way that users will specify it
      when installing Office. You can specify whether the server will be
      accessed by users with a drive letter (for example, G:\) or a UNC
      path (for example, "\\server\share"). If you select drive letter,
      users installing Office must have that drive letter mapped to this
      folder before running Client Setup.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - When Setup asks where you want the shared application files
      installed, the option you select controls the choices your users have
      during client Setup:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       - Server: The shared application files remain on the server and run
<PRE></PRE>                 remotely; the user doe not have a choice during client
                 Setup.

       - Local Hard Drive: The shared application files are copied to the
                           user's local hard drive; the user does not have
                           a choice during client Setup.

       - User's Choice: The user is asked to choose Server or Local Hard
                        Drive during client Setup.

      This is not the same as shared applications supported by Program
      Group Control.

</PRE></OL>Setup then copies all files from the CD-ROM or floppy disks to the
administrative installation point.
<P>
After the installation is complete, share the two folders (\MSOFFICE and
\MSAPPS) on the network, either creating a single share that contains both
folders, or creating two separate shares, one for each folder.
<P>
NOTE: There is no SMSPROXY directory for Office 95. It is not necessary
to copy one to the MSOFFICE source directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating the Office 95 Package</h3>
 
<P>
The PDF for Office 95 is located in the MSOFFICE directory after the
administrative setup is complete. The file name is OFF95STD.PDF. To create
the package do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Packages Window in the SMS Administrator.

<P><LI>From the File Menu, choose New. The Package Properties dialog box will
   appear.

<P><LI>Choose the Import button. The File Browser dialog box appears. Change
   directory to the MSOFFICE directory which was created by the
   administrative setup.

<P><LI>In the File Name box, select the OFF95STD.PDF. Choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose the Workstations button. The Setup Package For Workstations
   dialog box appears.

<P><LI>In the Source Directory Box, type the location of the MSOFFICE directory
   created by the administrative setup, or use the browse button to find
   it.

<P><LI>Choose the Close button.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button to close the open dialog boxes.
<P>
</OL><h3>Distributing the Office 95 Package</h3>
 
<P>
Before distributing Office 95, ensure that your Site server and your
distribution servers have sufficient space for the Office 95 package. The
site server may need space for up to five copies of the Office 95 package.
SMS stores packages in the following locations:

<UL><LI>The source directory created by the administrative setup. This may not
   be located on the site server. 180 MB

<LI>Compressed copy of the package in SMS\SITE.SRV\SENDER.BOX\TOSEND. At
   most 180 MB, typically less.

<LI>Compressed copy of the package in SMS\SITE.SRV\DESPOOLR.BOX\STORE. At
   most 180 MB, typically less.

<LI>Temp directory in which the Despooler decompresses the package before
   placing on distribution servers. 180 MB

<LI>If the site server is also a distribution server there is an
   uncompressed package directory in the SMS_PGKx share. 180 MB.
<P>
</UL>Each distribution server also needs 180 MB of hard drive space for the
Office 95 package.
<P>
To distribute the Office 95 package do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Jobs window in the SMS Administrator.

<P><LI>From the File menu choose New. The Job Properties dialog box appears.

<P><LI>Select "Run Command on Workstation" as the Job Type.

<P><LI>Choose the Details button.

<P><LI>Select the Office 95 package from the list.

<P><LI>Select the Job Target

<P><LI>In the Distribute Phase select the appropriate distribution servers.

<P><LI>In the Run Phase select the appropriate command line from the package.
   The following command lines will be available:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Compact
      Typical
      Complete
      Workstation
      Custom
      Uninstall
</PRE><P>
   The first 4 command lines are unattended. "Custom" and "Uninstall"
   require user input.
<P>
</OL>For further information about completing the Job Details dialog box, please
see Chapter 11. Jobs of the "Systems Management Server Administrator's
Guide."
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Office 95 on Client Computers</h3>
 
<P>
To install Office 95 your users must run Package Command Manager and
execute the supplied command line. If the users execute the 'Custom'
command line, they see the Run From Network Server option in addition to
the other installation options. This is the same as the 'Workstation'
command line. If a user selects this option, the main Office application
files are left on the server and run remotely.
<P>
NOTE: When network users use the Run From Network Server option, Setup
places approximately five megabytes of files in the user's main Office
folder. For workarounds that can reduce this disk space usage, see chapter
8, Installing Microsoft Office in the "Microsoft Office for Windows 95
Resource Kit."
<P>
For further information on specific Office 95 installation issues please
see the OFREADME.TXT and the NETWORK.TXT files included on the Microsoft
Office for Windows 95 CD-ROM and Disks.
