The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Despooler log shows:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find the package file. we'll fail the job (Job ID = M020002D1
   Package ID = W_M0200024)
   CDeltaSource: InitDeltaFile - couldn't get file name
   CDeltaSource: AddObjectAndDeliver - couldn't initialize Delta file
   Despooler failed to execute the instruction, error code = C000000b

</PRE>If new Run Command on Workstation jobs are sent after this Despooler
error is logged, they fail at the Scheduler level and the Scheduler log
displays the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   ERROR: Cannot connect to secondary source. Scheduler will not attempt
   to transfer jobs from secondary to primary source.

</PRE>No Run Command on Workstation or Share Package on Server jobs are able to
get past the Scheduler.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem occurs because the logon (Sender) account specified does not
have permissions on the Site.srv\Despoolr.box\Receive directory (that is,
the SMS_SITE share) of the Systems Management Server site server. You can
check the permissions by opening the Site Properties, clicking Addresses,
and then clicking Properties (of the local site code), and finally clicking
Details.
<P>
If a Sender Service is configured to use an account that is not the same as
the Systems Management Server service account, then the security context of
this Sender Service account is used by some other Systems Management Server
subservices of the SMS Executive program.
<P>
If this Sender account does not have permissions on the SMS_SITE share,
then the Scheduler and the Despooler services stop working.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The Logon (Sender) Account is used by the Sender to connect to the SMS_SITE
share of the Systems Management Server site server and must have Full
Control permissions for the SMS_SITE share. The account must also have Read
and Write permissions for the Site.srv\Despoolr.box\Receive directory on
the site server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Sender Account that the site uses to connect to itself should usually
be the same as the SMS service account for that site, but you can use a
different Sender Account to connect to other sites in the hierarchy.
<P>
IMPORTANT: If you change the Systems Management Server Service Account
using Systems Management Server Setup, the Sender Accounts are not changed.
To successfully change the permissions, you must manually change the Sender
Accounts in the Site Properties of the Systems Management Server site
server.
