The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Program Group Control (PGC) stops responding on client computers running
Windows or Windows for Workgroups, and displays the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Program Group Control
   Please wait for configuration to complete
   Checking current Configuration

</PRE>The client does not recover until the user stops Appctl16.exe by depressing
CTRL+ALT+DEL and ending the task.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Program Group Control is incorrectly returning to query User-Group
membership from the domain under which the computer was last verified by a
Systems Management Server logon script, rather than querying the domain
under which the user is currently logged on. The following are two examples
of how this situation may occur:

<UL><LI>Logging into a domain without any Systems Management Server logon
   servers from a Systems Management Server client that had previously been
   inventoried into a Systems Management Server domain through the use of
   logon scripts (for example, running Smsls.bat from the logon script).

<LI>Logging into a Systems Management Server domain without running a logon
   script from a Systems Management Server client that had previously been
   inventoried into a different Systems Management Server domain through
   the use of logon scripts (for example, running Smsls.bat from the logon
   script.
<P>
</UL>The net effect of not running a Systems Management Server logon script is
that Setls16.exe does not run, and consequently does not update the
ValidatingServer= entry in the [SMSLSIni] section of the Sms.ini file with
the current logon server. As a result, Program Group Control continually
uses the old ValidatingServer= entry to determine which domain controller
to query for User-Group membership.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, remove the entry for the server listed in the
ValidatingServer section of the Sms.ini file. When this entry is left
blank, Appctl16.exe determines the actual current logon server and proceeds
to only query this server for User-Group membership.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
