The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After moving a Systems Management Server NetWare Logon Server from site A
to site B, you may see some extraneous .tmp files in the Sms\Logon.srv
directory of that logon server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When clients log on to a NetWare server that has been moved from one site
to another and run the Systems Management Server script, the inventory will
not be taken for three times (or however many times InvAgtFalseLogonCount
is set for). On the third logon, the clients write a .tmp file in the
Sms\Logon.srv\Inventry.box directory on that NetWare logon server. The .tmp
file is a small file, and does not contain all the inventory information.
The .tmp file will not be converted to a .raw file, and therefore is not
moved by Maintenance Manager to the site server.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, manually delete the .tmp files. Be sure to
only delete those files that are affected by this problem, and do not
delete any new .tmp files that are waiting to be converted to .raw files.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
