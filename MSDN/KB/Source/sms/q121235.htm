<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT Server Standard Server configuration is not supported by
Systems Management Server version 1.0. However, if a Standard Server is
configured properly, it can be used in a Systems Management Server site
under certain conditions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A Standard Server can be used in a Systems Management Server site under the
following conditions:

<UL><LI>A Standard Server that is a member of a domain with SMS installed can be
   used by SMS. A server set up in this configuration is treated similar to
   a Helper Server. A Standard Server that is a member of a workgroup
   rather than a domain cannot be used by SMS. A server set up in this
   configuration is similar to a workstation.

<LI>For a Standard Server that is a domain member, SMS attempts to install
   the Inventory Agent (INVWIN32) and Package Manager (PCMSVC32). These are
   installed into the SMS\HELPER.SRV directory. A Standard Server behaves
   similar to a Helper Server, but the full functionality of a Helper
   Server has not been tested, so it is not officially supported.
<P>
</UL>There currently are difficulties with Systems Management Server
differentiating whether a Standard Server is a member of a domain, or a
member of a workgroup that has the same name as a domain.
<P>
The Site Configuration Manager insures that all servers in a domain are
accessible with administrator rights. A Standard Server that is a workgroup
member does not have a copy of the domain SAM database, and will not have
the proper Systems Management Server services account.
<P>
A Standard Server that is a workgroup member will be used by Systems
Management Server if the following conditions are met:

<UL><LI>The workgroup must have the same name as a domain that has Systems
   Management Server installed.

<LI>The Standard Server must have an account identical to the Systems
   Management Server account in the domain mentioned above.
<P>
</UL>This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a
future release.
