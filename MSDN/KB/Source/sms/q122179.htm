<P>
This article details Systems Management Server event log codes 200 through
249.
<P>
<P><h2>Event Log Codes 200 - 249</h2>
 
<P>
Code   Description
----   -----------
<P>
200    The registry is not set up properly for Inventory Agent to run.
<P>
201    The registry is not set up properly for an instruction to execute.
<P>
202    Insufficient memory to execute an instruction. Close one or more
<PRE>       other applications and restart.

</PRE>203    The registry is not set up properly for a system job instruction to
<PRE>       execute.

</PRE>204    Insufficient memory to execute a system job instruction. Close one
<PRE>       or more other applications and restart.

</PRE>205    The registry in [X] is not set up properly for the instruction to
<PRE>       execute.

</PRE>206    Failed to store the master package from X to Y.
<P>
207    Alerter: An alert has been generated.
<P>
208    Insufficient memory to configure or watchdog this site. Close one
or
<PRE>       more other applications and restart the Site Configuration Manager.
       Possible NT error: (X)

</PRE>209    The SMS Identification section in the NT registry (X) is not set up
<PRE>       correctly for the Site Configuration Manager. For a new site, this
       may be due to the Site Configuration Manager not receiving a site
       control file within the first (Y) minutes. For an existing site,
       this may be due to an invalid or missing SiteCode (3 alphanumeric
       characters) or Install Directory (full DOS pathname not at root of
       drive). Another attempt will be made every (Z) seconds. Possible NT
       error: (N)

</PRE>210    Cannot find the directory (X) for site control files. The SMS
<PRE>       installation directory may have been deleted. Another attempt will
       be made every (Y) seconds. Possible NT error: (Z)

</PRE>211    Error reading site control file (X). This file may be corrupted or
<PRE>       the data may not be valid. Check to make sure that this site has
       been completely de-installed if this is a new or re-installation.
       The invalid site control file has been renamed to (Y). Include a
       copy of this file with your bug report. Possible NT error: (Z)

</PRE>212    An error occurred while writing the User Group delta-MIF file for
<PRE>       this site. This may be due to one or more inactive domains. Ignore
       this error if it occurred during an unsuccessful setup attempt.
       Another attempt to write this file will be made after the next Site
       Properties change or after (X) minutes. Possible NT error: (Y)

</PRE>213    An error occurred while writing the site control file (X). Verify
<PRE>       that the disk drive on this server has sufficient free disk space.
       Another attempt to write this file will be made after the next Site
       Properties change or after (Y) minutes. Possible NT error: (Z)

</PRE>214    An error occurred while creating the system job to send a site
<PRE>       control file to the parent site (X). The site control file has been
       renamed to (Y). Verify that the disk drive on this server has
       sufficient free diskspace and that the installation of this site
       succeeded. Another attempt will be made after the next Site
       Properties change or after (Y) minutes. Possible NT error: (Z)

</PRE>215    Cannot find Windows NT server (X) on the network. The server may be
<PRE>       down (inactive) or the server's domain may be down or not part of
       this SMS site. Component (Y) will be started on the SMS site
</PRE>server.
<PRE>       Verify the server's status independent of SMS. Verify the spelling
       of the servername in the Site Properties -&gt; Services dialog in the
       Systems Management Server UI. This server must be an NT server in
</PRE>an
<PRE>       active NT domain that is part of this SMS site. This server must
       either be automatically detected or included in the server list for
       this domain.

</PRE>216    An error occurred while copying the logon script file(s) (A) to
<PRE>       server (B) in domain (C). Windows NT directory replication must be
       enabled for server (D) with server (E) as the export server for
       replicating SMS logon script files. Verify server (F) has a SCRIPTS
       directory under the REPL$ share and the SMS service account has
       access privileges to this share and directory. Users' logon script
       paths will not be modified until the logon script files have been
       successfully copied. Possible NT error: (G)

</PRE>217    An attempt to verify the domain type failed for domain (X). The
<PRE>       domain controller may be down (inactive). If the domain controller
       for this domain is an NT or LAN Manager server, the NetLogon
</PRE>service
<PRE>       may not be running. If the domain controller for this domain is a
       LAN Manager or LANServer server, this may be due to the OS/2
</PRE>session
<PRE>       limit being exceeded, and if so, the Site Configuration Manager
</PRE>will
<PRE>       recover from this after one or more sessions to this server are
       dropped. This may also be due to the SMS service account having
       expired for this domain. The domain status is changed to inactive.
       Verify the domain's status independent of SMS. Verify the domain
       type and the spelling of the domain name in the Site Properties -&gt;
       Domains dialog in the Systems Management Server UI. Possible NT
       error: (Y)

</PRE>218    Cannot find domain (X) on the network to enumerate servers. This
may
<PRE>       be due to the Computer Browser service not running on the SMS site
       server. If this is a NetWare domain, this may be due to the Gateway
       Service for NetWare not running on the SMS site server. If this is
       an NT or LAN Manager domain, this may be due to the Computer
</PRE>Browser
<PRE>       service not running on any NT server in this domain. If this is a
       LAN Manager domain, you may need to add this domain to the list of
       other domains for the Computer Browser. This is done using the
       Control Panel Network applet -&gt; Computer Browser -&gt; Configure on
</PRE>the
<PRE>       primary domain controller for the SMS site server's domain. The
       domain status is changed to inactive. Verify the domain's status
       independent of SMS. Possible NT error: (Y)

</PRE>219    Cannot find NT server (A) on the network for outbox (B). Server (C)
<PRE>       or the server's domain may be down (inactive) or not part of this
       SMS site. Outbox (D) will be unavailable until the server is up and
       detected during the next watchdogging cycle. Check earlier event
       messages fromthe Site Configuration Manager for this domain and
       server. Verify the server's status independent of SMS. Check the
       spelling of the servername in the Systems Management Server UI.
       This server must be in anactive NT domain that is part of this SMS
       site. Possible NT error: (E)

</PRE>220    Cannot create a shared directory on server (A) for outbox (B). This
<PRE>       may be due to the SMS service account having insufficient
</PRE>privileges
<PRE>       on this server or the server (C) or server's domain (D) being down
       (inactive). Verify that the SMS service account has Administrator
</PRE>or
<PRE>       Supervisor equivalent access privileges on this server and that the
       account has not expired. Check earlier event messages from the Site
       Configuration Manager for this domain and server. Also verify that
       the drive letter for this outbox exists and this drive has
       sufficient free disk space. Possible NT error: (E)

</PRE>221    Cannot find server (A) on the network. The server or the server's
<PRE>       domain (B) may be down (inactive) or the SMS service account may
</PRE>not
<PRE>       have access privileges to this server. If this is a NetWare domain,
       this may be due to the Gateway Service for NetWare not running on
       the SMS site server. If this is an NT domain, this server must be a
       Windows NT server. If this is a LAN Manager or LAN Server domain,
       this server must be a primary domain controller or backup domain
       controller. The server status is changed to inactive. Verify the
       server's status independent of SMS. Check the spelling of the
</PRE>server
<PRE>       name in the Site Properties -&gt; Domains dialog in the Systems
       Management Server UI. The SMS service account must have
       Administrator or Supervisor equivalent access privileges on this
       server, an identical password to the SMS site server service
       account, and must not have expired. Possible NT error: (C)

</PRE>222    Cannot enumerate shares for  server (A) in domain (B). This may be
<PRE>       due to the Computer Browser service not running on the SMS site
       server. If this is a NetWare domain, this may be due to the Gateway
       Service for NetWare not running on the SMS site server. If this is
       an NT or LAN Manager domain, this may be due to the Computer
</PRE>Browser
<PRE>       service not running on any NT server in this domain. Possible NT
       error: (C)

</PRE>223    Cannot create shared directories on server (A) in domain (B) for
<PRE>       inboxes(C). This may be due to the SMS service account having
       insufficient access privileges to connect to this server, to create
       a directory or share, or to set directory and share access
       permissions. Verify that the SMS service account has Administrator
       or Supervisor equivalent access privileges on this server and has
       not expired. Check if this server has sufficient free disk space.
       Possible NT error: (D)

</PRE>224    Cannot find a drive or volume with sufficient free disk space on
<PRE>       server (A) in domain (B). This may be due to the SMS service
       account having insufficient access privileges to determine the
       available drives or volumes for this server. If this is a Netware
       server, this may be due to the server having no available user
       connections at this time. The volume or drive must have a minimum
</PRE>of
<PRE>       (C) MB free. This server will be marked inactive. Another attempt
</PRE>to
<PRE>       install this server will be made after the next Site Properties
       change or during the next watchdog cycle.

</PRE>225    Cannot install or start component (A) on server (B) in domain (C).
<PRE>       This may be due to the SMS service account having insufficient
       access privileges to install or start this component on this
</PRE>server.
<PRE>       This may also be due to one or more missing, incorrectly copied, or
       out-of-date executable files on this server that are required by
       this component. Verify that the SMS service account has not
</PRE>expired.
<PRE>       This account must be in the Domain Admins global user group for
       domain (D) and have the Logon As Service user right in this domain
       or on this server. Also check for the existence of the system map
       file (E) on the SMS site server. Another attempt to install or
</PRE>start
<PRE>       this component will be made after the next Site Properties change
</PRE>or
<PRE>       during the next watchdog cycle. Possible NT error: (F)

</PRE>226    The parent site code (A) specified in the site control file does
not
<PRE>       match the previous parent site code (B) that is stored in the
       Identification section of the SMS registry. The parent site will
</PRE>now
<PRE>       change to (C).

</PRE>227    Cannot find previously detected server (A) on the network. This
<PRE>       server or the server's domain (B) may be down (inactive). The
</PRE>server
<PRE>       status is changed to inactive. Verify the server's status
       independent of SMS. Another attempt to detect this server will be
       made after the next Site Properties change or during the next
       watchdog cycle. If this server stays inactive for more than C days,
       it will be removed from the Domains section for domain (D) in the
       SMS registry even though it has not been de-installed. Possible NT
       error: (E)

</PRE>228    Cannot find a logon server in domain (A) to use as the export
server
<PRE>       for logon script files. There must be at least one active domain
       controller in this domain for SMS to use as the export server for
</PRE>NT
<PRE>       directory replication. Users'logon script paths will not be
</PRE>modified
<PRE>       until the logon script files have been successfully copied to an
       export server's REPL$\SCRIPTS directory. Possible NT error: (B)

</PRE>229    The following user accounts in domain (A) were altered to automate
<PRE>       SMS logon scripts: (B). This involved changing the Logon Script
</PRE>Path
<PRE>       for each user account from blank to (C).

</PRE>230    The following user accounts in domain (A) could not be altered to
<PRE>       automate SMS logon scripts: (B). This may be due to the SMS service
       account having insufficient access privileges for modifying user
       accounts in this domain. Possible NT error: (C)

</PRE>231    The system logon scripts for the following servers in domain (A)
<PRE>       were altered to automatic SMS logon scripts: (B).

</PRE>232    The system logon scripts for the following servers in domain (A)
<PRE>       could not be altered to automatic SMS logon scripts: (B). This
</PRE>error
<PRE>       may be caused by the system logon script files not existing or the
       SMS service account having insufficient access privileges for
       modifying files on these servers. Possible NT error: (C)

</PRE>233    Cannot create shared directory (A) on server (B) to store
executable
<PRE>       files for SMS component (C). This may be due to the SMS service
       account having insufficient access privileges to connect to this
       server, to create a directory or share, or to set directory and
       share access permissions. Verify that the SMS service account has
       Administrator equivalent access privileges on this server and has
       not expired. Check if this server has sufficient free disk space.
       Possible NT error: (D)

</PRE>234    Cannot copy the following executable files for SMS component (A) on
<PRE>       server (B): (C). This may be due to the SMS service account having
       insufficient access privileges to connect to this server or to
       create or write files. This may also be due to the files being
       locked because the component isrunning. Verify that the SMS service
       account has Administrator equivalent access privileges on this
       server and has not expired. Check if this server has sufficient
</PRE>free
<PRE>       disk space. The Upgrade mode of the Systems Management Server Setup
       UI can be usedto refresh the files on the SMS site server and
       initiate a site shutdown of all components followed by a re-copying
       of all component executable files to all servers. Possible NT
</PRE>error:
<PRE>       (D)

</PRE>235    No active servers were found for domain (A). This may be due to all
<PRE>       servers in this domain being down (inactive) or a Computer Browser
       error enumerating the servers in this domain. The domain status is
       changed to inactive. Verify in a manner independent of SMS that at
       least one server is active. Another attempt to detect servers in
       this domain will be made after the next Site Properties change or
       during the next watchdog cycle. Possible NT error: (B)

</PRE>236    Cannot install to server (A) in domain (B). The share (C) on this
<PRE>       server was previously created for SMS site (D). This may be due to
       an attempt to install two sites in domain (E) with at least one not
       having Use Specified Servers for this domain as a Domain Property
</PRE>in
<PRE>       the Systems Management Server UI. This may also be due to
</PRE>specifying
<PRE>       this server (F) as part of a domain in two sites or this server
       being previously part of a different SMS site that was not
       successfully de-installed. The status of this server is changed to
       inactive for this site. Possible NT error: (G)

</PRE>237    Cannot open or successfully read the system map file (A). Check for
<PRE>       the existence of the system map file (B) on the SMS Site Server.
       Verify that it is identical to the released system map file, or if
       modified, that all changes are syntactically correct. Possible NT
       error: (C)

</PRE>238    The service account and password has been successfully changed for
<PRE>       all SMS services. The new service account is (A).

</PRE>239    The SQLServer account, password, and server name has been
<PRE>       successfully changed for SMS. The new SQL account for server (A) is
       (B).

</PRE>240    Cannot change the service account and password for SMS component
(A)
<PRE>       on server (B) in domain (C). This may be due to the new account not
       existing in this domain. Another attempt to change the service
       account will be made after the next Site Properties change or
</PRE>during
<PRE>       the next watchdog cycle. Possible NT error: (D)

</PRE>241    Cannot save the next available SMS Unique ID (A) in file (B)
<PRE>       for this site. This may be due to this file being locked by another
       application. The purpose of saving this ID is to prevent duplicate
       SMS Unique IDs from being generated if this site is re-installed
       with the same site code. This entry can be added by hand to the (C)
       file on the SMS site server by adding this line to the file in the
       [D] section:  =  Possible NT error:  (E)

</PRE>242    Cannot start site configuration until a site control file is
<PRE>       received. If this is a new site, this may be due to the user
</PRE>pausing
<PRE>       the Systems Management Server Setup UI or some other delay in the
       delivery of the site control file. If this is an existing site,
       this may be due to the SMS registry being corrupted. Verify that
</PRE>the
<PRE>       section in the SMS registry is correct. The master site control
</PRE>file
<PRE>       (A) in directory (B) can be used to force an update ofthe registry
       by copying this file to a new file with a (C) file entension.
       Possible NT error: (D)

</PRE>243    Could not get a SQL connection.
<P>
244    The SQL connection has been reestablished.
<P>
245    A MIF could not be processed and has been moved to file X.
<P>
246    Failed to access registry section.
<P>
247    Cannot find file X to continue the current operation.
<P>
248    Failed to write to file X, verify there is enough disk space on the
<PRE>       machine and there is no process that locked the file.

</PRE>249    Cannot open outbox X. Verify the server is up and the outbox
<PRE>       directory exists.
