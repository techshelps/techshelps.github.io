The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Two menu options for Network Monitor are placed on the Start menu, one
in the Administrative Tools group, and one in the Network Analysis Tools
group. Depending on which icon you use to start Network Monitor, the
Network Monitor program may behave differently or erratically, or it may
function with limited abilities (like not being able to capture all network
traffic).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT Server 4.0 Network Monitor is installed in the &lt;System
root&gt;\System32\Netmon directory. By default, the Systems Management Server
Network Monitor installation location is C:\Nm (or x:\Sms\netmon if you are
installing Network Monitor onto a Systems Management Server site server).
If both versions of Network Monitor are installed, you will observe
different results in Network Monitor, depending on which Netmon.exe
executable file you ran.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If the Windows NT 4.0 "Network Monitor Tools and Agent" is installed in
the Winnt\System32\Netmon directory before you install Network Monitor from
the Systems Management Server compact disc, specify the &lt;System
root&gt;\System32\Netmon directory as the installation location during the
Systems Management Server Network Monitor installation. However, note that
two menu options for Network Monitor are placed on the Start menu, one in
the Administrative Tools group, and the other in the Network Analysis Tools
group. Both of these icons start the same version of Network Monitor, and
you can remove one of them by changing the Taskbar properties.
<P>
If the Windows NT Server 4.0 Network Monitor is installed and the Systems
Management Server Network Monitor is installed into a directory other than
the &lt;System root&gt;\System32\Netmon directory, two menu options for Network
Monitor are placed on the Start menu, one in the Administrative Tools
group, and one in the Network Analysis Tools group. Each of these icons
runs a different version of the program.
<P>
To remove the Windows NT Server version of Network Monitor, perform the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Settings and click Control Panel. Double-
   click the Services icon.

<P><LI>Select Network Monitor Tools and Agent, and click Remove.

<P><LI>Click Add, and select "Network Monitor Agent."

<P><LI>Shut down the computer and restart it.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
