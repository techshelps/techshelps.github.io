<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0 and 1.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run DEINSTAL.BAT on a Windows for Workgroups SMS client machine
and Logon at Startup is not selected, the following message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Your machine has successfully been prepared for deinstallation.
   Microsoft SMS will be deinstalled the next time you start Windows. Phase
   1 of Client de-install complete. If this is a Windows machine, you must
   start or restart Windows now for the deinstallation to complete.

</PRE>The next time you start Windows for Workgroups, SMS is not removed.
<P>
However, the next time you start Windows for Workgroups, choose the Log
On/Off icon in the Network group, and log on, a similar message appears.
Neither the SMS nor program groups are removed. In addition, the
applications specified on the SMSRUN16.INI autostart line are not run.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
SMS does not display a dialog box asking the user to logon when it detects
that the Windows for Workgroups machine is not logged on.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Run Control Panel and choose the Networks icons.

<P><LI>Choose Startup.

<P><LI>Select Log On at Startup.

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run DEINSTAL.BAT or UPGRADE.BAT, Client Setup flags the SMS.INI
file to indicate that SMS needs to do one or more of the following:

<UL><LI>Install a new client component.
<LI>Remove a client component.
<LI>Complete client upgrade.
<LI>Remove the client.
<P>
</UL>When Windows is restarted, SMSRUN16/32 checks the SMS.INI file. If SMS
determines in needs to perform one of the previously mentioned tasks, it
connects to the logon server and launches SMSSRV16/32. SMSRUN16/32 then
calls Client Setup to do the actual installation or removal of files. When
Client Setup is done, SMSSRV16/32 processes the SMSRUN*.INI file and loads
the applications to be automatically started.
<P>
SMS uses this sequence because SMSRUN16/32 has to ensure that none of the
SMS client components, including itself, are running while Client Setup
tries to delete or overwrite their files.
