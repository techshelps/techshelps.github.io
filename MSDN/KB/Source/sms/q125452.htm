The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Systems Management Server allows you to trace the
actions performed by the SMS services. When tracing is enabled, each
service makes log entries for actions that it performs or errors that it
receives in a log file. The log files are ASCII text and can be viewed with
a text editor. However, SMS includes a Tracer utility that parses these log
files and presents them in a clearer, more user-friendly manner than plain
text viewing. Tracer also allows interactive viewing of the SMS log files
as the services are writing to them.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are currently two versions of this utility, TRACER.EXE and
SMSTRACE.EXE
<P>
TRACER.EXE is a command line console-mode utility that reads changes made
to a text file in real time. This file is located in the PSSTOOL\&lt;arch&gt;
directory on the SMS 1.0 and 1.1 CD-ROM. For SMS 1.2 it is located in the
SUPPORT\DEBUG\&lt;arch&gt; directory on the CD-ROM.
<P>
<PRE>   Usage: tracer &lt;path to one of the SMS log files&gt;

</PRE>SMSTRACE.EXE is a graphical user interface (GUI) multiple document
interface (MDI) version and is included in the SITE.SRV\&lt;arch&gt;.BIN
directory.
<P>
SMSTRACE.EXE allows you to customize the display by selecting options such
as columns, filtering, and ignore new lines. You can also Cut and Paste and
Print from SMSTRACE. SMSTRACE.EXE also allows viewing of several log files
simultaneously.
<P>
To install SMSTRACE as an icon in the SMS group:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Systems Management Server group windows.

<P><LI>From the Program Manager File menu, select New.

<P><LI>Choose New Program Item. For the Command Line, enter:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;drive&gt;:\sms\site.srv\&lt;arch&gt;.BIN\SMSTRACE.EXE
</PRE><P>
   For the working directory, enter:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;drive&gt;:\sms\site.srv\&lt;arch&gt;.BIN
</PRE><P>
</OL>The SMS services log files are all located in the SMS\LOGS directory except
for the Site Configuration Manager log file SCMAN.LOG and the Bootstrap log
file BOOT.LOG.
