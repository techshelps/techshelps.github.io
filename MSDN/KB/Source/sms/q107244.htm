Release Notes

<OL><P><LI>Patching Windows NT(TM) Server on the Site Server Before running SMS,
</OL>you should update Windows NT Server on your site servers with some new
versions of Windows NT files supplied on the SMS CD-ROM. This is especially
important for SMS site servers that run Network Monitor or that use Gateway
Services for NetWare to communicate with NetWare computers.
<P>
The files that are updated are NDIS.SYS, NWAPI32.DLL, and NWRDR.SYS. The
update to NDIS.SYS fixes a problem with Network Monitor on ring networks.
The other two files fix problems with enumerating NetWare user groups and
getting the correct version number of NetWare servers.
<P>
Although these updates are essential only for primary or secondary site
servers that either run Network Monitor or that use Gateway Services for
NetWare to communicate with NetWare computers, Microsoft recommends that
you apply the update to all computers running Windows NT including
clients.
<P>
SMS provides two utility programs (for Windows NT and for Windows for
Workgroups) and a PDF so that you can update Windows NT easily. The PDF is
PATCHRDR.PDF. This PDF contains package commands for both Windows NT
(Windows NT Patch of Redirector) and Windows for Workgroups (WFW Patch of
Redirector).
<P>
For the Windows NT update, the files and the utility program PATCH.EXE are
located in the PATCHES\NT subdirectory of the SMS CD-ROM. For the Windows
for Workgroups update, the files and the utility program PATCH.EXE are
located inthe PATCHES\WFW subdirectory of the SMS CD-ROM.
<P>
To use the PDF, perform the following steps:
<P>
1) Set up the package source directory:
<PRE>   a. Create a package source directory.
   b. Create an NT subdirectory and a WFW subdirectory beneath the package
      source directory.
   c. Copy all the files from the PATCHES\NT directory on the SMS CD-ROM to
      the NT subdirectory of the package source directory.
   d. Copy all the files from the PATCHES\WFW directory on the SMS CD-ROM
      to the WFW subdirectory of the package source directory.

</PRE></OL>2) Create a package. When you do so, import the PDF by choosing the Import
<PRE>   button in Package Properties, then choosing PATCHRDR.PDF from the list.

</PRE>3) Choose the Workstations button.
<P>
4) In the source directory box, type the path to the package source
<PRE>   directory you created in step 1.

</PRE>5) Select Windows NT Patch of Redirector and choose the Properties button.
<P>
6) In the Command Line Properties dialog box, select both the Automated
<PRE>   Command Line and System (Background) Task options.

</PRE>7) Choose OK to close all the open dialog boxes.
<P>
8) Create Run Command On Workstation jobs to run the appropriate package
<PRE>   command on the appropriate computers.

</PRE>To run the patch program manually on a computer, change directories to the
PATCHES\NT subdirectory of the SMS CD-ROM, and type patch. Then reboot the
computer for the changes to take effect.
<P>
This causes the appropriate files (listed in the PATCHLST.000 file) to be
updated. The files are updated only if the versions of these files on the
SMS CD-ROM are newer than the versions already on the computer. Note that
the old versions of these files are retained, but their file extensions
are changed to an unused 3 digit number.
<P>
If you have a Windows NT version 3.5 system and OpenGL is not installed,
the patch utility may not run because it believes that you are trying to
patch a Windows NT 3.1 version system. If you know for certain that you are
running version 3.5 of Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation on
your computer, you may safely override this check by using the -f option
(patch -f).

<OL><P><LI>Site Upgrade
</OL>When you upgrade a site, the SMS Setup program does not install the SMS
Setup program. You can manually copy the SMS Setup program (SETUP.EXE) from
the SMSSETUP\platform.BIN of the SMS CD-ROM (where platform is the
processor type of the site server) to the SITE.SRV\platform.BIN directory
on the site server.
<P>
When you upgrade a site, make sure that you close all SMS administration
utilities on the site server (such as the SMS Administrator, SMS Security
Manager, and so on) before you begin the upgrade. These utilities may lock
SMS system files so that they cannot be replaced by Setup.
<P>
Before you can upgrade a secondary site, all secondary sites must be
active. Therefore, you must resolve any problems with secondary sites, or
allow components to finish being added to a secondary site, before you can
upgrade a secondary site. You can check on a site's status by looking at
the icon representing the site in the Sites window of the SMS
Administrator.

<OL><P><LI>SMS Service Account
</OL>Within a site, if you set up any trust relationships between domains, you
should have just one SMS Service Account in one master domain at the site.
<P>
Within a site, if you set up your Windows NT(TM) domains using a trust
model (such as the single master domain model), you should set up a single
SMS Service Account in the master domain, and have other domains use this
trusted account. Do not set up other SMS Service Accounts in the other
domains. Note that all domains in the site must trust the master domain
(which contains the SMS Service Account). In addition, the SMS Service
Account in the master domain should be a member of the Administrators local
group in all domains at the site, and have Log On As A Service rights in
all domains at the site.
<P>
If you set up your Windows NT domains without setting up a trust model, you
should avoid setting up any trust relationships and you should use a local
domain account for the SMS Service Account. In addition, you must create an
SMS Service Account in each domain at the site. In each domain, the SMS
Service Account must be a member of the Administrators local group and have
Log On As A Service rights in all domains at the site.

<OL><P><LI>SMS Administrator
</OL>On site servers, a user must log on to the site server computer with a user
account that is a member of the Administrators local group in the site
server domain. On site servers, the SMS Administrator (and other utilities
such as SMS Service Manager, SMS Security Manager, and so on) can only be
installed in the SITE.SRV directory. For security purposes, the Site
Configuration Manager assigns permissions for the SITE.SRV directory to
only the Administrators local group. No other group or user can run a
program from the SITE.SRV directory. If you want to give other users the
ability to run the SMS Administrator, you should install the SMS
Administrator on a computer running Windows NT that is not the site server.
<P>
When you use the Limit To Sites control in the Execute Query, Job Details,
and other dialog boxes, the list displays only the yellow primary site
icon. This icon is used to denote a site in general. It is not used to
differentiate between a primary site and a secondary site.

<OL><P><LI>SMS Database Manager
</OL>The SMS Database Manager is provided so that you remove the Audited
Software group when you want to perform a software audit that contains only
the latest audited software. If you do not use the SMS Database Manager to
remove the Audited Software group, the SMS site database will store the
cumulative inventory for the Audited Software group (that is, any updates
will simply be added to the current record for the group). The SMS Database
Manager (DBCLEAN.EXE) is installed in the SITE.SRV\platform.BIN directory
(where platform is the processor type of the computer where it is
installed) on any computer where the SMS Administrator is installed.
<P>
Before you use the SMS Database Manager to change or remove items in a
database, make sure that there are no administrators using the SMS
Administrator to access that database.

<OL><P><LI>SMSLS.INI
</OL>The default SMSLS.INI file is placed in the SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX directory
on the site server. If you want to use SMSLS.INI to map clients to domains,
modify the version in this location. If you have enabled the Automatically
Configure Workstation Logon Scripts option, the Site Configuration Manager
copies the SMSLS.INI file from this location to the REPL$ share of SMS
logon servers running LAN Manager and Windows NT Server. If you have not
enabled the Automatically Configure Workstation Logon Scripts option, you
must manually copy the SMSLS.INI file to the NETLOGON shares of the SMS
logon servers.
<P>
For computers running Windows NT that are part of a domain, SETLS uses the
domain as the workgroup if a WORKGROUP=DOMAIN mapping is specified in the
SMSLS.INI file. For example, if the computer is in the SMSDOM domain and
the SMSLS.INI file has SMSDOM = CENTRAL mapping for WORKGROUP, the computer
running Windows NT is added to the site in the CENTRAL domain. You can also
use the [WIN.INI] section to map computers running Windows NT to domains.
<P>
Also, for LAN Server clients, you may need to use SMSLS.INI to successfully
report inventory to a LAN Server domain. If SMSLS.CMD and SETLSOS2 are
unable to find the current logon server, you must define the LAN Server
domain(s) in both the [Domain] and [Workgroup] sections of the SMSLS.INI
file. For example, if the user is logged on to the IBMLSDOM domain the
SMSLS.INI file should have IBMLSDOM = IBMLSDOM mapping in both the [Domain]
and [Workgroup] sections.

<OL><P><LI>IBM® LAN Server
</OL>You must restore package shares on LAN Server package servers after those
servers have been restarted. LAN Server does not directly support
persistent shares. When you restart the LAN Server package server, the
shares on the computer are not restored, and you must restore them
yourself. The shares to restore are SMS_PKGx and all the shares for shared
packages and workstation packages. It is a good idea to note the names and
paths of these shares while the server is running, so you can restore them
after the server is restarted.
<P>
Site Configuration Manager restores shares after a LAN Server logon server
has been restarted. LAN Server does not directly support persistent shares.
When you restart the LAN Server computer, the shares on the logon server
are not restored. The Site Configuration Manager will restore these shares
(SMS_SHR and SMS_SHRx) on the LAN Server computer during its watchdog
cycle. If you don't want to wait for the watchdog cycle, you can restore
these shares yourself at startup.
<P>
SMSOS2AG.EXE (called the SMS_NET_MAPPER service in Beta versions of SMS) is
run as an executable file instead of running as a service. On OS/2 2.1x
clients, Client Setup configures SMSOS2AG.EXE to run as an executable
program from STARTUP.CMD. Be sure that SMSOS2AG.EXE appears in STARTUP.CMD
after the commands to start the network. SMSOS2AG.EXE provides network
support for Package Command Manager in the Windows(TM) subsystem of OS/2.
Note that SMSOS2AG.EXE does not have an 8 character limit for the package
server or logon server for LAN Manager.
<P>
If you have an IBM LAN Server domain in an SMS site, and you want to use
the SMS ability to automatically configure logon scripts, you must do the
following:
<P>
a) Be sure you have selected the Use All Detected Servers option in the
Domain Properties dialog box for the domain. To access this dialog box,
select the site in the Sites window and choose Properties from the File
menu. Then choose the Domains button, then choose the Properties button in
the Domains dialog box.
<P>
b) On the domain's primary domain controller, you must create the REPL$
share by typing net share repl$=c:\ibmlan\repl\export. Note that the
primary domain controller must be the export server for the logon scripts.
<P>
c) On the primary domain controller, create a SCRIPTS subdirectory under
the IBMLAN\REPL\EXPORT directory.
<P>
d) If the primary domain controller does not already have a REPL.INI file
in the EXPORT directory, create one with the following entries
EXTENT = TREE
INTEGRITY = FILE
If a REPL.INI file already exists, you do not have to change its settings.
<P>
e) In the [Replicator] section of the IBMLAN.INI file on the primary domain
controller, add these two lines (if they do not already appear):
REPLICATE = BOTH
EXPORTPATH = C:\IBMLAN\REPL\EXPORT
<P>
f) In the [Replicator] section of the IBMLAN.INI file on the backup domain
controllers, make sure the settings configure the backup domain controllers
to import replicated files from the primary domain controller (the default
IBMLAN.INI settings allow this).
<P>
g) Also in the IBMLAN.INI of the primary domain controller and backup
domain controllers in the domain, add replicator to the Srvservices line in
the [Server] section, so that the Replicator service starts automatically
when the server starts.
<P>
h) Restart the Replicator service on the primary domain controller and all
backup domain controllers in the domain.
<P>
You are now ready to automatically configure logon scripts within SMS. SMS
will set SMSLS.CMD as the script for users who don't currently have
scripts, and append SMSLS to the scripts of those users who do already have
logon scripts.

<OL><P><LI>Novell® NetWare®
</OL>For NetWare 4.x logon servers, you must make additional changes to the
system login script when you use the Automatically Configure Workstation
Logon Scripts option.
<P>
NetWare 4.x login scripts require an explicit mapping when accessing a
volume on the NetWare server. This means that you need to add some lines to
the SMS commands that were added to the system login script by the Site
Configuration Manager.
<P>
After the Site Configuration Manager has configured the system login script
on NetWare 4.x logon servers, you must add lines to the SMS commands to map
a drive to the volume containing the SMS logon server (LOGON.SRV) directory
on the logon server.
<P>
On NetWare servers, the Site Configuration Manager adds the following lines
to the system login script (these lines work correctly on NetWare 3.x
servers):
<P>
REM Microsoft Systems Management Server (start)
<P>
REM SMS 1.0
set SMS_LOGON="SMSVOL:smsroot\logon.srv"
INCLUDE %&lt;SMS_LOGON&gt;\SMSLS.SCR
set SMS_LOGON=
<P>
REM Microsoft Systems Management Server (end)
<P>
Where SMSVOL:smsroot is the volume and directory name for where SMS is
installed on the logon server. For NetWare 4.x, the SMS lines in the login
script must have the following form:
<P>
REM Microsoft Systems Management Server (start)
<P>
REM SMS 1.0
map root X:= SMSVOL:smsroot\logon.srv
set SMS_LOGON="X:"
INCLUDE %&lt;SMS_LOGON&gt;\SMSLS.SCR
map rem X:
set SMS_LOGON=
<P>
REM Microsoft Systems Management Server (end)
<P>
Where SMSVOL:smsroot is the volume and directory name for where SMS is
installed on the logon server.

<OL><P><LI>Clients Running MS-DOS
</OL>SMS supports MS-DOS version 5.0 and later. On pages xxx-xxxi of the SMS
Administrator's Guide, the text states that SMS provides support for MS-DOS
version 3.3 or later. The text should state the MS-DOS version 5.0 or later
is supported.
<P>
SMS provides only MS-DOS support for clients running Microsoft Network
Client for MS-DOS version 3.0. (Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version
3.0 is provided on the Windows NT Server CD-ROM.) SMS does not support SMS
components within the Windows 3.1 environment on clients that run Microsoft
Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0. For full SMS support on clients
running Windows 3.1, the client should use LAN Manager version 2.1 or later
Enhanced Workstation or Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
In addition, the Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 has the
following limitations:
<P>
a. You cannot use the remote troubleshooting utilities on these clients
using NWLINK. You can use
remote troubleshooting utilities on these clients over NetBEUI or TCP/IP.
<P>
b. SMS will not be able to read the network card ID of these computers, so
this information will
not be shown in the inventory for these computers.

<OL><P><LI>Clients Running Windows for Workgroups
</OL>SMS clients that run Windows for Workgroups must have the latest version of
the VREDIR.386 file. This file is dated 9-04-94 at 8:07 A.M. You can get
this file from the PATCHES\WFW directory on the SMS CD-ROM. This version of
this file is also shipped on the Windows NT Server CD-ROM. If you already
updated this file from that CD, you do not need to update it again from the
SMS CD-ROM.
<P>
For SMS, the latest version of this file is required to correct a problem
where Windows for Workgroups clients lose connections when running the
SMSLS script at logon time. A PDF to automatically update Windows for
Workgroups computers is also provided.
<P>
To use the PDF, perform the following steps:
1) Set up the package source directory:
<P>
a. Create a package source directory.
<P>
b. Create an NT subdirectory and a WFW subdirectory beneath the package
source directory.
<P>
c. If you are also using the PDF for updating Windows NT, copy all the
files from the PATCHES\NT
directory on the SMS CD-ROM to the NT subdirectory of the package source
directory.
<P>
d. Copy all the files from the PATCHES\WFW directory on the SMS CD-ROM to
the WFW subdirectory of
the package source directory.
<P>
2) Create a package. When you do so, import the PDF by choosing the Import
button in Package Properties, then choosing PATCHRDR.PDF from the list.
<P>
3) Choose the Workstations button.
<P>
4) In the source directory box, type the path to the package source
directory you created in step 1.
<P>
5) If you are using the package for updating Windows NT, select Windows NT
Patch of Redirector and choose the Properties button. In the Command Line
Properties dialog box, select both the Automated Command Line and System
(Background) Task options.
<P>
6) Choose OK until you have exited all dialog boxes.
<P>
7) Create Run Command On Workstation jobs to run the appropriate package
command on the
appropriate computers.

<OL><P><LI>Macintosh®
</OL>The Apple Installer is required to install the appropriate SMS files to a
Macintosh client. The Apple Installer is not supplied with this copy of
SMS. After SMS Setup has completed on a primary site server, follow the
directions below to add this file to the server. You must complete the
steps below before adding any Macintosh clients to SMS, and before adding
any secondary sites that have Macintosh clients.
<P>
You must use version 3.4 or later of the Apple Installer. A valid version
of the Apple Installer can be found on any set of System 7.1 or System 7.5
Macintosh operating system disks.
<P>
To copy the file to your site server, from a computer running Windows NT
Server Services for Macintosh (SFM), create a Macintosh share using MacFile
in the File Manager on an NTFS partition. (Warning: a FAT partition does
not store Macintosh files correctly and will fail.) From a Macintosh
computer, insert the install disk that contains the Apple Installer. Mount
the Macintosh share volume from the computer running Windows NT Server.
Copy the Apple Installer file from the disk to the share volume. Then use
the File Manager to copy the file to the
SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\CLIENT.SRC\MAC.BIN directory.
<P>
If this is a primary site with no secondary sites, the Installer file will
automatically be copied to the MAC.BIN directory in the logon share. If
there are secondary sites connected, then the Installer may not be
automatically copied to all sites. If this is the case, a change to the
date of the SYSTEM.MAP file in the SMS directory will cause all files to be
updated, including secondary sites. After copying the Installer to the
correct path, you can modify the SYSTEM.MAP file date by using a text
editor to open the SYSTEM.MAP file and save the file with no changes made.
<P>
For Run Command On Workstation jobs targeted for Macintosh clients, the
Despooler gives the package volume (SMS_PKGx where x is the drive where the
package is installed) all permissions (See Files, See Folders, and Make
Changes) to Everyone. If you want to change permissions, you must manually
set the permissions on the package volume and its subfolders. When a
package directory is shared as a Macintosh volume, the permissions set in
the Access dialog box of the Setup Package For Workstations dialog box for
a package are ignored for the Macintosh volume. However, the Despooler
always sets the permissions for the package's Windows NT share to the
permissions specified in the Access dialog box.
<P>
For Macintosh clients, the Client Software settings in the Clients dialog
box are ignored. When the SMS client software is installed on a Macintosh
client, the Installer always installs the Inventory Agent, Package Command
Manager, and MIF Entry program (MIFMAC) on the computer's hard disk. The
Installer also configures the computer to run the INVMAC program
automatically during system startup. The INVMAC program automatically
starts the Package Command Manager. The MIF Entry program must be started
manually by the user.
<P>
If you have two Macintosh computers with identical computer names in two
different zones, and both of these computers have been added to the same
SMS domain, then you should not use the Machine Path to specify a Run
Command On Workstation job to go to just one of these computers. If you do
use a Machine Path to specify the computer name for the job, the job will
go to both of these computers, and you cannot control which one it will go
to.
<P>
You can use PDFs supplied with SMS to distribute packages to Macintosh
clients. The applications for which PDFs are supplied, and the names of
each file, are listed at the end of this section.
<P>
When you set up the package source directory for one of these applications,
press the command key while double-clicking the Setup icon. Continue
pressing the command key until the first dialog box appears. For more
information on setting up the package source directory for these
applications, see the README file for each application for information on
setting up the application on the network.
<P>
Two options for installation on the client are offered. One option allows
the user to install a complete version on their Macintosh. The other option
allows the user to install a version that runs from a network share volume.
For Macintosh applications shared this way, all users will run the
application directly from the server with the package source directory
(unlike PC applications, which can be distributed to several servers for
load balancing).
<P>
The following table lists each application for which PDFs are supplied, and
the PDF to use when installing the application. Use the same PDF for both
installing the application on Macintosh clients, and for installing the
application for shared use on a server.

</OL>SMSOS2AG.EXE (called the SMS_NET_MAPPER service in Beta versions of SMS) is
run as an executable file instead of running as a service. On OS/2 2.1x
clients, Client Setup configures SMSOS2AG.EXE to run as an executable
program from STARTUP.CMD. Be sure that SMSOS2AG.EXE appears in STARTUP.CMD
after the commands to start the network. SMSOS2AG.EXE provides network
support for Package Command Manager in the WindowsTM subsystem of OS/2.
Note that SMSOS2AG.EXE does not have an 8 character limit for the package
server or logon server for LAN Manager.
<P>
SMSOS2AG.EXE provides network support for Package Command Manager in the
WindowsTM subsystem of OS/2. Note that SMSOS2AG.EXE does not have an 8
character limit for the package server or logon server for LAN Manager.
<P>
On OS/2 computers, the Client Setup program requires that OS/2 be installed
on drive C.

<OL><P><LI>Troubleshooting Client Operations
</OL>If you are having trouble installing or running SMS client software, check
for the following (also, refer to Appendix A in the Microsoft Systems
Management Server Administrator's Guide):
<P>
The appropriate Windows network drivers are installed. Examine the network
= entry in the Windows SYSTEM.INI file. One of the following entries should
be present: lanman21.drv, wfwnet.drv, msnet.drv, or netware.drv. If the
appropriate driver is not loaded, Package Command Manager and Program Group
Control will not start. Make sure that the login account on the client has
read access to the SMS logon server's SMS_SHR. For problems with Run
Command On Workstation packages: Make sure that packages are designated for
the appropriate operating systems. For example, if a package is targeted
for clients running MS-DOS, it will not appear on clients running Windows
version 3.1.
<P>
The date and time on the client must be consistent with the SMS server's
date and time. If these values are not the same, a situation can occur
where the package expiration time has already passed by the time the
package arrives.
<P>
Check the event log for failure explanations. Likely problems include
insufficient disk space on a client or a network connection failure. In the
latter case, try to make the network connection with the net use command.
<P>
For shared packages (network applications), see "Troubleshooting Network
Application" later in this document.

<OL><P><LI>Services
</OL>Only use the Very Fast mode for the Response setting in the Services dialog
box for test purposes or for very small sites. The Very Fast mode places a
heavy load on the site server--especially if the site is large.

<OL><P><LI>Inventory
</OL>On clients running MS-DOS, Windows version 3.1, and Windows for Workgroups,
the Inventory Agent always reports the protocol that it used to connect to
the SMS logon server where it is running from. If information about other
protocols is available to the Inventory Agent, it will also report these
protocols.
<P>
On clients running Windows for Workgroups or LAN Manager, you must run the
SMSLS batch file or Inventory Agent using the Full (or Enhanced)
Redirector. If you use the Basic Redirector, the Inventory Agent will not
be able to report inventory and will prompt you for an SMSID (press the
Enter key) or terminate with an error that says your drive may be full. To
solve this problem, start the network software using the Full or Enhanced
Redirector.
<P>
If you have clients that have both NetWare and LAN Manager networking
capabilities, you should set up SMS to use only one of those network
operating systems on those clients. Note that SMS supports only one network
operating system at a time on a client.
<P>
To deliberately have users not run logon scripts (especially with dual LAN
Manager and NetWare stacks):
<P>
Both: Create a user group and add the users who you don't want to run the
script.
<P>
NetWare: Modify the system logon script for each server so that members of
the group skip the SMS script commands. Or you can modify SCRIPT.SCR so
that members of the group skip the SMS script commands.
<P>
LAN Manager: Through User Manager, modify the logon scripts for the entire
group to point to a different logon script name that has no file extension.
<P>
To handle computers with duplicate SMSIDs, remove and reinstall SMS on the
computers where you want to create a new SMSID. If two or more clients have
the same SMSID, you can generate a new SMSID for those computers by 1)
removing SMS from the computers where you want to create a new SMSID and 2)
readding the computer to the site. You can remove SMS from a client by
using the Client Setup program with the /R switch. You can manually add a
computer by running the SMSLS batch file from the SMS_SHR of an SMS logon
server. For more information about removing SMS from a client, see
"Removing SMS Components from Clients" in Chapter 3 of the SMS
Administrator's Guide. For more information about manually adding clients
to a site, see "Manually Adding Clients to a Site" in Chapter 3 of the SMS
Administrator's Guide.
<P>
The Inventory Strategy When Network Is Slow setting takes effect when the
next Logon Script Configuration Interval elapses. By default, this interval
is 24 hours. You can confirm that the Site Configuration Manager has
updated this setting at the site by looking in the Site Configuration
Manager's trace log (look for NETSPEED.COM and NETSPEED.DAT).
<P>
If a computer running MS-DOS or Windows has an inventory report that has no
changes from the previous inventory, the Inventory Processor does not
create a Delta-MIF to report the time of the inventory scan. Instead, the
Inventory Processor waits for the inventory heartbeat period to elapse
(compares the last inventory report with the time of the current inventory
report) before it sends a Delta-MIF reporting no change and the scan time.
By default, the heartbeat period is 4 days. This means that the Last
Hardware Scan and Last Software Scan dates displayed in the Workstation
Status section of the Personal Computer Properties window could be
different from the date of the actual most recent scan by as much as the
heartbeat period. Note if a change occurs in a computer's inventory, the
Inventory Processor creates a Delta-MIF reporting the change and the scan
time.
<P>
If the Inventory Data Loader sends a resync command to a client and there
has been no change to the inventory, the client will not report a resync
inventory until the inventory heartbeat period has elapsed (4 days, by
default).

<OL><P><LI>Audited Software
</OL>If you want to customize the AUDIT.RUL file, you should rename the rule
file to a different filename. If you upgrade the site, SMS Setup will
overwrite the AUDIT.RUL file with the version on the SMS CD-ROM.
<P>
RUL2CFG.BAT requires only one parameter. On page 219 of the SMS
Administrators Guide, the text states that RUL2CFG.BAT requires 2
parameters. RUL2CFG.BAT requires only the package rule filename. The CFG
file is not requires because the AUDIT programs must always have a CFG file
named AUDIT.CFG.
<P>
If you do not use the SMS Database Manager to remove the Audited Software
group, the SMS site database will store the cumulative inventory for the
Audited Software group (that is, any updates will simply be added to the
current record for the group). The SMS Database Manager (DBCLEAN.EXE)
is provided so that you remove the Audited Software group when you want to
perform a software audit that contains only the latest audited software.
<P>
Before you create a job using the Audit 1.00 package, you must run
RUL2CFG.EXE to create the AUDIT.CFG file used for the software auditing
package. You must do this the first time you create a job with the package.
If you make changes to the package rule file, you should also run
RUL2CFG.EXE again to update the AUDIT.CFG file.
<P>
The RUL2CFG.BAT file puts the AUDIT.CFG files it creates into the
PRIMSITE.SRV\AUDIT\PACKAGE\ platform.BIN directories (where platform is the
processor type). The AUDIT.CFG file is not placed in the
PRIMSITE.SRV\AUDIT\PACKAGE directory as stated in the documentation. Also,
package auditing using the RUL2CFG.BAT file in the default location
(PRIMSITE.SRV\AUDIT) works only if the source directory for the package
auditing is the PRIMSITE.SRV\AUDIT\PACKAGE directory.
<P>
For package inventory rules or the package rule file, do not enclose a
clause containing OR operators with parentheses. Parentheses (grouping)
around clauses containing an OR operator in inventory rules or the package
rule file cannot be compiled by RUL2CFG.EXE nor Maintenance Manager.
<P>
The package rule file does not support an implicit AND clause before a set
of OR clauses. The RUL2CFG.EXE compiler will not compile a package rule
file containing an AND clause before a set of OR clauses. If you place the
AND clause after the OR clauses, the RUL2CFG.EXE compiler will successfully
compile the CFG file.
<P>
The following rule will fail to compile:
file "file1"
(
<PRE>     file "file2"
     or
     file "file3"
     or
     file "file4"
</PRE></OL>)
<P>
However, the following rule will compile:
(
<PRE>     file "file2"
     or
     file "file3"
     or
     file "file4"
</PRE>)
file "file1"
<P>
Package rule file (AUDIT.RUL) does not support an explicit AND operator.
The RUL2CFG.EXE compiler will not compile a package rule file containing an
explicit AND operator. If you use no operator between two files, this is
treated as an implicit AND operator. To combine file rules with AND
operators, simply list them one after the other without an operator.
<P>
The following rule will fail to compile:
file "file1"
AND
file "file2"
<P>
However, the following rule will compile:
file "file1"
file "file2"

<OL><P><LI>Outboxes
</OL>You cannot move Outboxes to another drive or server. Additionally, you
cannot rename Outboxes.

<OL><P><LI>Creating and Distributing Packages
</OL>When you create a package, in the Workstation Command Line box you can type
a path relative to the package source directory. For example, if the
package source directory is C:\APP, and the command line you want to run is
C:\APP\SETUP\SETUP.EXE, you can type setup\setup.exe in the Workstation
Command Line box.
<P>
When you use either a Run Command On Workstation job or a Share Package On
Server job for a package created using a PDF, clients that run the job may
be rebooted when the job runs. Usually, a client reboots only the first
time it receives a package created with a PDF. On some clients running
Windows NT Workstation version 3.1, the reboot may damage data in files
held open by other applications running at the same time. This happens only
on clients running Windows NT Workstation version 3.1. When you create a
job to install a Microsoft application that has a PDF, you must copy the
applications SMSPROXY directory to the package source directory. Copy the
PRIMSITE.SRC\IMPORT.SRC\appname\SMSPROXY directory (and its contents) to
the package source directory you create for the application. You must
perform this step when creating a package to either install the application
on clients or to set the application up on a server as a shared
application.
<P>
When you send a Share Package On Server job to install a shared application
for which SMS supplies a PDF and the target computers include at least one
client running Windows NT version 3.1, the job status will appear as
"Retry," even if all the target computers have run the command
successfully. When you see a Share Package On Server job with "Retry"
status, check the Job Status Details dialog box to get more accurate
information about the overall job status. You can also contact the users of
the clients running Windows NT version 3.1 to determine if the software was
installed correctly.
<P>
If you used a Beta version of SMS to create and distribute a package for an
ACME application (an application for which a PDF is supplied), you should
delete these packages before you use this version of SMS. You should create
a remove package job for each of the old packages, wait until those jobs
finish, then delete the packages in the SMS Administrator. Then you can
reimport the new PDFs, rebuild the packages and program groups, and resend
the packages.

<OL><P><LI>Program Group Control
</OL>After you initially install SMS on the site server domain and add a client
to the site server domain, you may see the following message when running
Program Group Control:
<P>
Program Group Control: Could not open the application database due to a SMS
profile error.
<P>
If you add a client to the site by running the SMSLS batch file (or Client
Setup) from a logon server with no servers in the [Servers] section,
Program Group Control will display this message.
<P>
After you initially install SMS on the site server domain, you should
ensure that all the logon servers are listed in the [Servers] section of
the DOMAIN.INI file on the SMS_SHR share of each logon server in the site
server domain. Normally, this can take up to 30 minutes (longer if there
are a large number of servers in the site server domain).
<P>
You can correct this error by running the SMSLS batch file or Client Setup
again when there are one or more servers listed in the [Servers] section of
DOMAIN.INI.
<P>
When a user who uses network applications logs on, the user may see the
following message:
<P>
Failed to connect to SMS network server. Cannot determine which groups the
users belong to. Please contact your administrator.
<P>
This means the client cannot see any of the package servers that it is
supposed to see. To correct this problem:
<PRE>   a) Examine the SMSERROR.TXT file in the Windows directory on the client.
</PRE></OL>This file may contain more specific information regarding the failure.
There may be sufficient information here for you to correct the problem.
<PRE>   b) Examine the [servers] section of the SMS.INI file on the client. Set
</PRE>up a network connection to the SMS_SHR share of one of the servers listed
in this section. Within the SMS_SHR share, change to the
APPCTL.BOX\DATABASE directory and look for files with the .HAF and .HGF
extensions. If there are no files with these extensions, the site
administrator may not have distributed a program group for the network
applications to this site, or the client may not have the appropriate
security credentials to see files in the share.
<P>
For shared network applications, SMS does not install program items in
program groups other than the program groups SMS creates. If an application
normally installs an icon in another program group (such as Startup), you
can copy the necessary program item from an SMS program group to the
other program group. For applications with program items in non-SMS program
groups, you should also make sure the Drive Mode setting for the package
properties is either Runs With UNC Name or Requires Specific Drive Letter.
<P>
After you upgrade the SMS software on an SMS logon server, all clients must
run SMSLS.BAT (or the user must run their logon script, if that script runs
SMSLS.BAT) before trying to run any shared applications made available by
SMS.
