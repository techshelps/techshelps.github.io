The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
This symptom occurs with a Systems Management Server (SMS) client that has
the SMS client software installed and is using a NetWare redirector. The
SMS client does not report its inventory to a Windows NT server when the
client's redirector is switched to MS Networking.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When an SMS client's redirector has been changed in this fashion, the
following error message appears when Invdos.exe is executed from the login
script:
<P>
<PRE>   No network found.

</PRE>This problem potentially applies to any client operating system SMS
supports that can also support more than one of the following network
types:
<P>
<PRE>   2 = Windows NT 3.x or higher
   3 = LAN Manager 1.x
   4 = LAN Manager 2.x (includes WFWNET)
   5 = NetWare 2.x
   6 = NetWare 3.x or higher

</PRE>After the network type has been changed, the client will not be moved to
the new SMS domain until it has run the SMS login script or Runsms.bat
three times. The client will receive the message
<P>
<PRE>   Different site/domain combination

</PRE>until the move to the new domain is completed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
After the SMS client software has been successfully installed on a client,
the type of networking used by the client is not reevaluated if the client
switches to a different redirector.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to avoid having to deinstall and reinstall the SMS client
components by manually editing the Sms.ini file on the client.

<OL><P><LI>Locate the NetworkType value in the [SMS] section of the Sms.ini file.

<P><LI>Change its value to match the type of networking the client now uses to
   gain access to the SMS logon server.
<P>
   For example, if the client was originally using NetWare VLMs and then
   later switched to MS Networking and logging in to Windows NT servers,
   change from "NetworkType=6" to "NetworkType=2." This will allow the
   client to properly report to the new Domain.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information
on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
