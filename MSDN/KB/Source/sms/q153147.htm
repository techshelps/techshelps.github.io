<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run inventory, the client computer stops responding approximately
33 percent of the way through the process. In verbose mode, the screen
hangs on game ports.
<P>
After waiting a minute or so, you may get a message indicating that the
device has timed out. You then have a choice to select either "FAIL" or
"ABORT." Regardless of the answer you enter, the computer locks and has to
be rebooted.
<P>
The last entry in the Smssafe.tmp file may show GamePorts=COMPLETED
(before, the file did not exist).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The client computer may have a device using the default game port address
(201h).  This problem will occur because SMS queries this address when
looking for game ports.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the Inventory Agent runs, it creates a file, Smssafe.tmp, to keep
track of any hardware failures. This file is stored in the \MS\SMS\DATA
directory in SMS 1.1 and in the &lt;SMS&gt; root directory for SMS 1.0. Any
failed hardware tests are written into this file while the Inventory Agent
scans the hardware. When the inventory collection is complete, the
Inventory Agent writes any failures to the Sms.ini file in the
[WorkstationStatus] section, using the FailedHardwareChecks keyword. After
moving the failed tests to the Sms.ini file, the Inventory Agent deletes
the Smssafe.tmp file.
<P>
DOS 6.22 MSD and other 3rd-party hardware diagnostic programs will also
detect the existence of interrupt 201h as a game port when there is not
one. To ensure that this is your problem, you can run MSD and determine if
a game port is found.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, create a file named Smssafe.tmp using a text
editor, such as Notepad, and add the following line:
<P>
<PRE>  GamePorts=CRASHED

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
