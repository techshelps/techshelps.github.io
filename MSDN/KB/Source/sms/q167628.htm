The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When adding a new computer to the database, Inventory Processor processes
the .raw file normally and the Dataloader processes the MIF, but the client
is not added to inventory. No BADMIF is created.
<P>
The information in the Dataloadr.log file looks similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Waiting for a MIF...
   Processing a machine...
   ~Requesting license for client BP007000
   ~There is not enough client license to add this machine
   Finished processing current machine.
   ~No more machine MIFs to be processed, terminating thread

</PRE>Additionally, License Manager logs the following error in the primary
domain controller (PDC) application event log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event Id: 201    Source: License Service
   No license was available for user BP007000 using product SMS 1.2.

</PRE>The result of this problem is a mismatch of the client record in the
database and the client's history file. When the next inventory is sent up,
Inventory Processor compares the .raw file to the history (.hms) file and
sends up only a Delta MIF to the Dataloader. If Dataloader is able to add
the client because there are now enough licenses, it will only include the
changed properties from the Delta MIF. The client properties in the Systems
Management Server Administrator program will have missing icons for those
properties that have not changed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Systems Management Server 1.2 enforces client licenses. If there are no
licenses available, Dataloader will not add the client to the database.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, it is necessary to increase the number of
client licenses for Systems Management Server and delete the offending
client's history file.

<OL><P><LI>Ensure that you have purchased an adequate number of Systems Management
   Server client licenses.

<P><LI>Start the Windows NT Server License Manager located in the
   Administrative Tools program group.

<P><LI>Click the Clients Per Seat tab.

<P><LI>On the License menu, click New License.

<P><LI>Add the number of purchased licenses.

<P><LI>Quit License Manager.

<P><LI>Stop and restart the License Logging Service.

<P><LI>Determine the client's Systems Management Server unique ID from either
   the Systems Management Server Administrator program or the Sms.ini file.

<P><LI>On the site server in the Sms\Site.srv\Inventry.box\history directory,
   delete the corresponding .hms history file.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
