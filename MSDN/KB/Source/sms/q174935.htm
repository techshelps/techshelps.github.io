<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Rservice.exe in a master domain model, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 5 Access is denied

</PRE>This error occurs when you run RSERVICE on a Windows NT computer that is a
member of one resource domain and the target computer is a member of a
different resource domain. In this situation, RSERVICE uses the incorrect
account to connect to the target computer. If RSERVICE is executed without
the /c switch, it should connect to the target system with the account of
user who is logged on. Instead of using the account of the user who is
logged on, it uses the account specified in the Rservice.ini file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Run RSERVICE from a computer that belongs to the master domain or the same
resource domain that the target computer is located in.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For example, you have domains R1, R2, and ACCTS in a master domain model
where domain R1 and domain R2 trust domain ACCTS (the master domain). An
administrator running RSERVICE on a Windows NT Server system belonging to
R1, is logged on to the ACCTS domain as ACCTS\MikeT and has specified
ACCTS\Smspcmsvc account in the Rservice.ini file.
<P>
The test target computer is in R2 and the ACCTS\Smspcmsvc account does not
have local administrative privileges to this client computer. As per the
documentation, the administrator is relying on RSERVICE to give this
ACCTS\Smspcmsvc account "Log on as a Service" rights and add this account
to the target computer's local Administrators group.
<P>
This fails and the "Error 5 Access is denied" error message is displayed.
RSERVICE incorrectly tries to use the ACCTS\Smspcmsvc account to install
the service instead of using the ACCTS\MikeT account which has
administrator privileges on the client computer. If you give the
ACCTS\Smspcmsvc account local administrator privileges to the target
computer, it will successfully install the service.
