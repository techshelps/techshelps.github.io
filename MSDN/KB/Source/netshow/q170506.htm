The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft NetShow version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The audio sounds bad or scratchy, hiss or pops, or is silent when I play NetShow clips.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot these problems:

<OL><P><LI>Open Sound Recorder.

<P><LI>Open the Microsoft Sound directory. (Found in the Media directory
   under your Windows directory).

<P><LI>Play the sound. If it sounds OK, then you can proceed. If it does 
   not play, check the directions for installing your sound device.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As.

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, click Format and pick the same Codec 
   and sampling rate that the source is using.

<P><LI>Click OK to accept the new format, and save the file as a different
   name or in a different directory. Do not overwrite the existing file.

<P><LI>Open the file saved in the previous step.

<P><LI>Play the file. If it does not sound OK, check the drivers you are
   using to ensure that they are the most recent and the proper drivers
   for your sound card. 
<P>
</OL>If the sound does not play properly in steps 3 and 8, you need to check
that your sound card drivers are installed, that your sound device is 
configured properly, and you are using the proper drivers for your sound
device and operating system. If the sound plays normally in steps 3 and 8
you should be able to play NetShow media.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft NetShow uses standard Windows compression codecs
(compression/decompression software). When you have poorly implemented
or incorrect sound card drivers installed, it can cause these codecs 
to play or record poorly. 
<P>
Many users unknowingly live with bad or incorrect sound drivers for 
long times because all the sounds included with Microsoft Windows
operating systems are PCM or uncompressed audio files. These files 
often will play correctly with bad or mismatched drivers. This problem
is not unique to NetShow. Virtually any multimedia program that uses 
Windows sound codecs and compressed audio files would show similar 
behavior.
<P>
NOTE: Mismatched means you have a sound card based on the ESS chipset,
which has Soundblaster functionality, and you are using SoundBlaster 
drivers rather than the ESS AudioDrive drivers). 
<P>
The most common source of problems is running a PNP soundcard under Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0. To support an ISA PNP soundcard, you need to manually install the ISA PNP manager. You can view information about this problem and find the PNP Sound Blaster driver on the Windows NT compact disc in the Drivlib\Audio\Sbpnp directory. Read the Readme file for detailed installation instructions.
