<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To assist system administrators in the proper application of Microsoft
streaming video technology, this article highlights differences between the
released NetShow 2.0 product and the beta NetShow Theater Server (NTS,
previously known as the NetShow Pro Full Screen Video Server).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<UL><LI>What is NetShow 2.0?
<P>
</UL>NetShow 2.0 provides a method of streaming video content (*.asf files)
through narrow bandwidth networks, such as the Internet.  Content is
created for an audience based on the data transfer rate at which the
average user will connect to the NetShow 2.0 server.  For example, if most
users are connecting to the Internet via 14.4 baud modems, then the *.asf
content is created to match that data transfer rate.
<P>
.asf files are usually rendered on the player in a small (320 X 240 pixel
or fewer) window. In addition to video, the .asf file can contain script
commands that cause a browser or other application to download and display
static content, such as Web pages.
<P>
NetShow 2.0 has the ability to stream live video and to provide that real
time content in multicast form:  any number of individual players can
connect to a single site and each will receive the same content stream.

<UL><LI>What is NetShow Theater Server?
<P>
</UL>NetShow Theater Server is a system for streaming full screen video at
comparable quality and control to that delivered by a VHS video cassette
player through a wide-bandwidth dedicated network. A typical application
for this product might be to provide a selection of full length feature
films for customers in a hotel, on an airplane, or a cruise ship.
<P>
*.vod content files contain all the same audio and video data as the
original MPEG source file.  The number of concurrent clients you can stream
video to is hardware dependent.  The speed of the content hard drives, the
number of content hard drives, the number of content servers, the bandwidth
of the network switch architecture, and other factors combine to define the
total capacity of the system.
<P>
Content in the form of MPEG format files is loaded onto the content drives
through the Administrative Workstation.  The NTS system can be configured
with fault tolerance so that hardware failures, such as the failure of a
content hard disk, do not disrupt client playback of titles.
