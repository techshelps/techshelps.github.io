The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft NetShow version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft NetShow consists of two components:

<UL><LI>NetShow On-Demand, a streaming media server, player, content
   creation/conversion tools and SDK

<LI>NetShow Live, a multicasting server (audio and file), player
   and SDK.
<P>
</UL>NetShow On-Demand streams Active Stream Format (ASF) files, which can be
converted from AVI, MOV, or WAV files. Additionally, ASFs in the form of
"illustrated audio", images synchronized with audio can be created with the
Microsoft Active Stream Editor that is part of the content
creation/conversion tools discussed above.
<P>
For complete information about the NetShow family of products, the concept
of streaming versus downloading, multicasting, the NetShow SDKs, full user
documentation, samples, and Frequently Asked Questions, see
<B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/netshow">http://www.microsoft.com/netshow.</A></B> All NetShow components are available for
download free of charge.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>NetShow On-Demand</h3>
 
<P>
NetShow On-Demand is the easiest, most cost-effective way to stream
audio, illustrated audio and video across intranets and the Internet.
<P>
Streaming offers the ability for content to start playing immediately
instead of downloading to the user's hard drive first. This allows
developers to provide very long content that can start playing right away.
<P>
Normally, when you access networked multimedia content you have to wait
for the entire file to be transferred before you can use the information.
Streaming allows you to see or hear the information as it arrives
without having to wait. Unlike most audio or video streaming products,
NetShow also enables the content provider to generate compelling
productions where audio, graphics, video, URLs, and script commands can
be synchronized based on a timeline.
<P>
Microsoft NetShow On-Demand consists of the Player, the NetShow On-Demand
Server, and several tools for easily creating or converting content.

<UL><LI>Microsoft NetShow On-Demand Player enables users equipped with
   Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT multimedia personal
   computers connected to a voice-grade telephone line or a corporate
   local area network (LAN) to play audio, illustrated audio, and
   video content on demand---with no download wait time.

<LI>Microsoft NetShow On-Demand Server allows you to host audio,
   illustrated audio (images synchronized with an audio track), and
   video content on a Windows NT Server for fast streaming delivery
   over corporate intranets and the Internet. NetShow On-Demand uses
   the ActiveX Streaming Format (ASF) to efficiently store and
   synchronize multimedia content for delivery over the network. The
   NetShow On-Demand Server takes advantage of the security,
   reliability, and scalability of Windows NT Server, and adds the
   ability to stream multimedia over UDP-IP.

<LI>Microsoft NetShow On-Demand Tools include the following:
<P>
   - ASF Editor. It allows you to create illustrated audio files
<P><PRE>     from standard audio and images, and to create Web tours by adding
     URL calls at specific points in the audio track. The easy-to-use
     graphical user interface makes content creation simple.
</PRE><P>
   - VIDtoASF. A quick and easy tool for preparing AVI and QuickTime
<P><PRE>     files into streaming format.
</PRE><P>
   - WAVtoASF. A quick and easy tool for preparing WAV audio files
<P><PRE>     into streaming format.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>NetShow Live</h3>
 
<P>
NetShow Live uses IP Multicast to efficiently deliver a stream of live
audio information to intranet users. IP Multicast is an open, standards-
based way to distribute identical information to many users simultaneously.
This contrasts with regular TCP/IP (IP unicast) where the same information
may be sent to many clients, but the sender must transmit an individual
copy to each user. NetShow Live multicast file transfer provides another
way for network managers to save bandwidth when large quantities of data
need to be distributed to many users at the same time. NetShow Live uses
Real Time Protocol (RTP) as its transport protocol.
<P>
The bulk of the traffic on networks today is unicast, meaning a separate
copy of the data is sent from the source to each client that requests it.
<P>
Networks today also support broadcasting, which sends a single copy of the
data to all clients on the network. However, multicasting sends a single
copy of the data to those clients who request it.
<P>
NetShow Live features include Microsoft NetShow Live Player (ActiveX
control), and Microsoft NetShow Live Server. The NetShow Live Server can be
installed on Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 2.0 and is
included in IIS 3.0.
<P>
