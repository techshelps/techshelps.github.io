</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Win32s is an operating system extension that allows Win32-based
applications to be run on Windows 3.1. Win32s consists of a VxD and a set
of dynamic-link libraries (DLLs).
<P>
It is possible to distinguish whether an executable was built for Win32 or
Win16. Win32 executables use the Portable Executable (PE) format, while
Win16 executables use the New Executable (NE) format.
<P>
The Windows 3.1 loader was designed to be aware that Win32-based
applications would potentially be loaded. When the user starts a
Win32-based application, the Windows 3.1 loader tries to load the
Win32-based application via WinExec(). WinExec() calls LoadModule(), which
will fail with an error indicating that it was passed an .EXE with the PE
format. At this point, WinExec() calls a special function to start up
Win32s. This function loads W32SYS.DLL (16-bit DLL) via LoadModule(). If
W32SYS determines that the EXE is indeed a valid PE file, it calls
LoadModule() on WIN32S.EXE (16-bit EXE) (it is similar to WinOldApp for MS-
DOS-based programs running in Windows). WIN32S.EXE contains the task
database, PSP, task queue, and module database. WIN32S.EXE calls its only
function to load the Win32s 16-bit translator DLL, W32S16.DLL, which does
work as a translator between the Win32-based application and the 16-bit
world that it is running in.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Win32-based applications are loaded in the upper 2 gigabytes (GB) of the 4
GB address space under Win32s, whereas Windows NT loads them in the lower 2
GBs. This is because W32S.386, a VxD, allocates the memory, and VxDs get
memory in the 2 GB to 4 GB range. The first 64K and the last 64K cannot be
read or written to (similar to a null page on other architectures).
<P>
On Windows 3.1, all applications, even the Win32-based applications, share
the same address space, unlike Windows NT where each Win32-based
application gets its own address space. Each Windows-based application may
be given its own address space, starting with Windows NT 3.5.
