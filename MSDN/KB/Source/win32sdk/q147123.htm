The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Speech Software Development Kit (SDK) version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Speech.h header file required to build applications written with the
Microsoft Speech SDK version 1.0 is not compatible with the Borland C\C++
compiler at this time. However, it is compatible with Microsoft Visual C++
versions 2.2 and 4.0, as well as the Symantec C++ version 7.2 compiler.
<P>
NOTE: Some products mentioned in this article are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft compilers support a 64-bit integer type, _int64. Borland does not
support this type. Also, Borland's compiler does not allow zero-length
arrays, which are used in the speech-recognition APIs.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
_int64 issue:
<P>
A workaround has been tried, which does seem to work, though its
effectiveness has not been rigorously verified.  To implement the
workaround, change the following line in Speech.h:
<P>
<PRE>   typedef unsigned _int64 QWORD, * PQWORD;

</PRE>to:
<P>
<PRE>   #ifdef __BORLANDC__
   typedef struct _tagQWORD {BYTE abData[8];} QWORD *PQWORD;
   #else
   typedef unsigned _int64 QWORD, *PQWORD;
   #endif //__BORLANDC__

</PRE>Zero length array issue:
<P>
Here's an example of the use of a zero length array as used in the
speech-recognition APIs:
<P>
<PRE>   typedef struct {
      DWORD    dwSize;
      DWORD    dwUniqueID;
      BYTE     abData[0];
   } SRCFGRULE, * PSRCFGRULE;

</PRE>This is not an absolutely blocking problem. Borland's compiler will compile
Speech.h if abData[0] is changed to abData[]. However, whether or not this
generates the same data structures as Microsoft compilers is unknown at
this time, so it is only a solution that is safe for making Speech.h
compile. Microsoft has not tested the structures beyond simple build tests
and can make no warranties about their effectiveness. The affected
structures include: SRCFGRULE, SRCFGIMPRULEW, SRCFGIMPRULEA, SRCFGXRULEW,
SRCFGXRULEA, SRCFGLISTW, SRCFGLISTA, SRWORDW, SRWORDA, SRPHRASEW,
SRPHRASEA, and SRCHUNK.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior demonstrates a design incompatibility between the two
products.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
These problems only affect the speech-recognition and text-to-speech APIs.
Voice-command and voice-text applications do not use QWORDs or the above-
named structures. Therefore, users of the voice-command and voice-text APIs
may make these changes, compile, and not worry about the results. If you
use the speech-recognition and text-to-speech APIs, you must test the
functions that use QWORDS rigorously to be sure that the values are coming
out properly, and you must check carefully to ensure that the structures
are being properly interpreted.
