<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the following topics concerning multimedia APIs in
the Win32 SDK:

<UL><LI>Some Windows version 3.1 APIs that require a device ID will also accept
   a properly cast device handle in the Win32 API if the caller is a 32-bit
   application.

<LI>An explanation of the difference between using a device ID and using a
   device handle in conjunction with the above functions is given.

<LI>A list of related APIs that are now obsolete but are provided for
   backwards compatibility with Windows version 3.1 is given.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Functions That Accept A Device Handle or Device ID</h3>
 
<P>
Several MIDI and wave audio APIs have been revised in Win32 to
provide greater flexibility to application developers. The following
APIs require the calling application to provide a device ID for the
target device under Windows 3.1, but under Win32 the APIs also
accept a properly cast device handle if the caller is a 32-bit
application:
<P>
<PRE>   midiInGetDevCaps
   midiOutGetDevCaps
   waveInGetDevCaps
   waveOutGetDevCaps
   midiOutGetVolume
   midiOutSetVolume
   waveOutGetVolume
   waveOutSetVolume

</PRE><h3>Device ID vs. Device Handle</h3>
 
<P>
A device ID has a one-to-one correspondence with the physical device
it references and is determined by querying for the number of
devices of a given type in the system and selecting the desired
device. A device handle refers to a specific instance of a device,
of which there may be more than one, and is obtained by opening a
device. A device instance may be thought of as a logical copy of
a physical device.
<P>
If a 32-bit application is querying a device's capabilities using
one of the xxxGetDevCaps APIs listed above, the distinction between
whether a device ID or device handle is used in the function call
is unimportant because all instances of a device have the same
capabilities. The result of one of these function calls will be the
same whether or not a device ID or device handle was used.
<P>
However, if a 32-bit application uses one of the xxxVolume APIs listed
above to get or set the output volume of a device, the distinction
between using a device ID or device handle becomes important. If a
device ID is used in a call to these xxxVolume APIs, then the result
of the call and/or information returned applies to all instances of
the device. If a device handle is used in a call to the xxxVolume
APIs, then the result of the call and/or information returned by the
call applies only to the instance of the device referenced by the
device handle.
<P>
The revised versions of the above APIs are available to 32-bit
applications only. For backwards compatibility reasons, 16-bit
applications are subject to the API design of Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Obsolete APIs</h3>
 
<P>
In addition to the above changes, the following related APIs are now
obsolete, but are included in Win32 for backwards compatibility
purposes:
<P>
<PRE>   midiInGetID
   midiOutGetID
   waveInGetID
   waveOutGetID

</PRE>For further information about all the above APIs and how to use
device IDs and device handles, please consult the Win32
Multimedia Programmer's Reference.
