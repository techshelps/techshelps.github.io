The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows 95 version 4.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT supports a Win32-based application type known as a Service. A
Service may be started at boot time, automatically, by a user with the
Service Control Manager facility or by Win32-based applications that use
the service-related Win32 APIs. The Service Control subsystem and the
associated Win32 APIs are not supported in Windows 95. In place of
services, Windows 95 has two registry keys that will allow users to run
applications before a user logs in when the system first starts up.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft recognizes the value that Services and the Service Control
manager have, therefore, we have implemented a smaller version of the
Service Control Manager in Windows 95 so that applications can run before a
user logs in. At boot time, the system checks two new registry keys:
"RunServices" and "RunServicesOnce".
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion
      RunServices  [key]
         bubba95=service.exe /params [string value]

      ...

      RunServicesOnce  [key]

      ...

</PRE>The value names are arbitrary. The value data is the command line passed to
CreateProcess(). Values under the key RunServicesOnce are deleted after the
application is launched. Because these applications are started before the
user logs onto the system, the user has not been validated and the
applications cannot assume that they have particular networking permissions
enabled. Windows 95, unlike Windows NT, only has one security context for
the entire system. Therefore, don't assume that any application that starts
has access to a particular network resource because a particular user has
access to this network resource.
<P>
Applications started by the RunServices and RunServicesOnce keys will be
closed when the user selects "Close all programs and log on as a different
user" from the Shutdown dialog on the Start Menu. A Win32-based application
can prevent itself or any other Win32-based application from being closed
when the user logs off by calling RegisterServiceProcess(). Win32-based
applications registered in this manner close only when the system is shut
down. However, the application must consider that different user can be
logged on at different times during its execution. The application can
distinguish between a user logging off and the system shutting down by
examining the lParam of WM_QUERYENDSESSION and WM_ENDSESSION. If the system
is being shut down, lParam is NULL. If the user is logging off, lParam is
set to EWX_REALLYLOGOFF.
<P>
To access RegisterServiceProcess, retrieve a function pointer using
GetProcAddress() on KERNEL32.DLL.
<P>
<P><h3>RegisterServiceProcess</h3>
 
<P>
DWORD RegisterServiceProcess(
<PRE>    DWORD dwProcessId,   // process identifier
    DWORD dwServiceType  // type of service
   );

</PRE>Parameters:

<UL><LI>dwProcessId: Specifies the identifier of the process to register as a
<P><PRE>      service process or NULL to register the current process. An
      application receives the process ID when it uses CreateProcess() to
      start the application.
</PRE>
<LI>dwServiceType: One of the following values:
<P>
<PRE>   Define                    Value       Meaning
   RSP_SIMPLE_SERVICE        0x00000001  Registers the process as a
                                         simple service process.

   RSP_UNREGISTER_SERVICE    0x00000000  Unregisters the process as a
                                         service process.

</PRE></UL>Return Value:
<P>
The return value is 1 if successful or 0 if an error occurs.
