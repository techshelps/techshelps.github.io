The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
AutoPlay is enabled by the new 32-bit, protected-mode driver architecture
in Windows 95. Because the operating system can now detect the insertion of
media in a CD-ROM drive, it has the opportunity to do some intelligent
processing whenever this occurs.
<P>
By default, Windows 95 only checks for an Autorun.inf file when a CD-ROM
disc is inserted into the CD-ROM drive. However, you may want to test for
syntax and logic errors before burning a CD-ROM disc. This article explains
how.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows 95, whenever a CD-ROM disc is inserted, the shell immediately
checks to see if the CD-ROM disc has a PC filesystem. If it does, Windows
95 looks for a file named Autorun.inf. If the file exists, Windows 95
follows the instructions contained in the file, which usually
involves running a setup application of some sort.
<P>
However, by changing a setting in the Windows 95 registry, you can have the
Shell use AutoPlay on any media, including shared network drives and floppy
disks.
<P>
The registry key that needs to be modified is:
<P>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\
<PRE>   Software\
      Microsoft\
         Windows\
            CurrentVersion\
               Policies\
                  Explorer\
                     "NoDriveTypeAutoRun"

</PRE>This key, which is of type REG_BINARY, consists of four bytes. The first
byte is a bitmask defining which drive types should be AutoRun. The
other three bytes should be set to zero (0).
<P>
The bits in the bitmask correspond to these constants:
<P>
<PRE>Type                Bit
</PRE> 
<PRE>DRIVE_UNKNOWN       0
DRIVE_NO_ROOT_DIR   1
DRIVE_REMOVABLE     2
DRIVE_FIXED         3
DRIVE_REMOTE        4
DRIVE_CDROM         5
DRIVE_RAMDISK       6

</PRE>Setting a bit in the bitmask prevents you from using AutoPlay with the
corresponding drive type. By default, the value in the registry is 0x95.
Bits 0, 2, 4 and 7 are therefore set, which means that drive types
DRIVE_UNKNOWN, DRIVE_REMOVEABLE, and DRIVE_REMOTE don't use AutoPlay
information. (Bit 7 is set to cover future device types.) Altering this
registry value thus allows you to test Autorun.inf files from a floppy disk
(DRIVE_REMOVEABLE), network drive (DRIVE_REMOTE), and so on. For example,
to be able to test AutoPlay from a floppy disk, set the value of the first
byte to 0x91 to enable AutoPlay for floppy disks.
<P>
NOTE: Most floppy disk drive controllers do not currently recognize when a
floppy disk has been inserted. To test AutoPlay on a floppy disk, first
alter the registry setting so that bit DRIVE_REMOVEABLE is not set, start
the Windows Explorer, insert the floppy disk, and press the F5 key to
refresh the display.
<P>
To test the Autorun.inf file on a given disk, using the right mouse button,
click the icon for the drive in the Windows Explorer. The effects of the
Autorun.inf file should be visible in the context menu.
