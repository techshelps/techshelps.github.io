The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows NT
   versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows NT, the security accounts manager (SAM) manages a set of
connections, referred to as active contexts. An active context is
established as a result of user management query and set operations.
Examples of operations that utilize active contexts are running User
Manager and making certain Win32 LAN Manager Networking API calls.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a process makes a SAM-related call, a single active context is
consumed on the target machine, for the lifetime of the client process or
the lifetime of the open SAM handle, whichever is less. Win32 LAN Manager
Networking API calls maintain a single cached SAM handle per process,
because opening the SAM is considered an expensive operation. A side effect
of this caching operation is the use of an active context on the machine
that was the target of the last user management function.
<P>
You can see active context utilization for remote SAM operations by running
the Netwatch utility in the Windows NT resource kit, or programmatically
through the Win32 Networking API NetFileEnum(). An active context appears
as an open resource named \PIPE\SAMR on the machine where the user
management call was focused.
<P>
In versions of Windows NT 3.51, prior to Service Pack 4, the maximum number
of active contexts is 255. This limit was raised in Windows NT Service Pack
4 to 2048. These limits exist to prevent client operations from exhausting
server resources, which could otherwise result in disruption of service.
<P>
The maximum active contexts is not an issue in most Windows NT
installations. However, in some large or complex installations, this may
become an issue. The following example describes one such scenario where
active contexts may be exhausted.
<P>
<P><h3>Example Scenario</h3>
 
<P>
A large number of workstations are running a process that queries user
information on the logon domain controller; this process remains running
throughout the day. In this scenario, each process consumes an active
context on the logon domain controller for the lifetime of the process. If
the number of client processes exceeds 2048 (or 255 prior to Windows NT
3.51 SP4), each new process fails the SAM connection against the domain
controller.
<P>
In current versions of Windows NT, there is no API call for directly
"closing" an active context. However, the following code fragment
illustrates an approach that can be used to achieve this:
<P>
<PRE>   #include &lt;lm.h&gt;

   PUSER_MODALS_INFO_0 umi0;
   NET_API_STATUS nas;

   //
   // Make remote calls to NetUserGetInfo(), etc.
   //
   // After remote calls have been made, make a local call, which updates
   // the cached SAM handle to point at the local machine. This has the
   // side-effect of closing the active context associated with the
   // previous call.
   //

   nas = NetUserModalsGet(
           NULL, // target local machine
           0,
           (LPBYTE *)&amp;umi0
           );

   if(nas == NERR_Success) NetApiBufferFree(umi0);
</PRE>
