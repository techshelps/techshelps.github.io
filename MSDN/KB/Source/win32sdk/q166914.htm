The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft DirectX 3 Software Development Kit, version 3.0
   on the following platform:
   - Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Modem or Serial line service provider, normally a dialog
box that collects connection information (that is, phone number or com port
settings) for hosting or joining a game appears. The dialog box does not
appear again if you close, release, and then open a new IDirectPlay2
interface object.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The only workaround is to exit the process.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some games are designed to open and then close DirectPlay game sessions
multiple times without exiting the process. This does not work properly
when you are using either the Modem or Serial line service provider, but
does work properly for either the TCP/IP or IPX service provider.
<P>
When you are using the IPX service provider, a dialog box requesting the
address of the host that is hosting the game you want to join does not
appear. IPX uses broadcasts to locate hosts and does not need to ask.
<P>
When you are using the TCP/IP service provider, you release an IDirectPlay2
interface object, and then open a new interface, the dialog box that
requests the address of the host that is hosting the game you want to join
is displayed.
<P>
When you are using the Modem service provider, you release an IDirectPlay2
interface object, and then open a new interface, the dialog box requesting
the phone number of the host that is hosting the game you want to join is
not displayed. Instead, DirectPlay dials the phone number from the previous
connection attempt. This is a bug.
<P>
When you are using the Serial line service provider, you release an
IDirectPlay2 interface object, and then open a new interface, the dialog
box requesting com port settings for either hosting or joining a game is
not displayed. Instead, DirectPlay uses the settings from the previous
connection attempt. This is a bug.
