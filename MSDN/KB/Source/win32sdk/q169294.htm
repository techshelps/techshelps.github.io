<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The D3DMIP Direct3D Immediate Mode example application demonstrates how to
create a mipmapped texture using a source and destination DirectDraw
surface.
<P>
A mipmap is a sequence of textures, each of which is a representation of
the same image at varying resolutions. The sequence of textures in a mipmap
are progressively lower in resolution and each image in the mipmap is a
power of two smaller than the previous level. The D3DMIP sample
demonstrates how to create and use a mipmapped sequence of textures in the
HEL and in the HAL.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
D3DMIP shows how to create a mipmapped texture surface and mipmapped
texture object from a series of three BMP files. There are three levels in
the mipmap and, consequently, three DirectDraw surfaces in the complex
surface are created for the mipmap. The creation of the mipmap is done in a
two step process. A source texture surface is created in system memory and
a source texture object is created by calling QueryInterface() on that
surface. A second, initially empty, DirectDraw texture surface is created
in video memory if 3D accelerated hardware was selected. If using the HEL,
the second surface is created in system memory. A second texture object,
the destination texture, is created based off of this surface. The source
texture is loaded into the destination texture surface with a call to
IDirect3DTexture::Load() and then discarded. This process allows a 3D
accelerated device to compress a texture map as it enters video memory
during the IDirect3DTexture::Load() call. The creation of textures must be
done in this manner. For further example code on the creation of source and
destination texture objects and texture surfaces, look at file "texture.c"
in the "misc" directory of the DirectX SDK samples.
