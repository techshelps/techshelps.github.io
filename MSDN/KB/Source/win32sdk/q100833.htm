<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32s versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.30, 1.30a, 1.30c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Translated pointers are guaranteed to be valid only for 32K, rather than
64K, which selectors are usually limited to. This limitation is for
performance reasons.
<P>
Selectors are tiled every 32K. A 0:32 pointer can be quickly translated
into a 16:16 pointer, which will be valid for a minimum of 32K. In other
words, the offset portion of the 16:16 pointer is not guaranteed to be 0
(zero) when translated. As a result, even though the translated selectors
have a limit of 64K, the offset passed to the 16-bit side may be as large
as 32K-1.
<P>
Selectors are created on a 32K alignment so that if you pass several
pointers to the same range, the Universal Thunk (UT) uses the same
selector. Selectors are freed when application terminates.
<P>
The alternative is to create a selector for each and every translation,
which is very slow.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For any given address, there are two selectors that point to it, but only
one has a limit less than 32K:
<P>
<PRE>           +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
           |Selector 2(64K)|Selector 4(64K)|Selector 6(64K)|
   +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
   |Selector 1(64K)|Selector 3(64K)|Selector 5(64K)|       |
   +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
   |  32K  |  32K  |  32K  |  32K  |  32K  |  32K  |  32K  |
   +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

</PRE>Under Win32s, 16-bit and 32-bit applications share the same global data
space; therefore, it is possible to share a buffer of up to 64K in size
with a far pointer or more than 64K with a huge pointer by doing the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Do a GlobalAlloc() on the 32-bit side. Be sure to use GMEM_MOVEABLE.
</OL>2. Copy the data.
3. Send the handle to the 16-bit side.
4. Get a pointer to the data on the 16-bit side by using GlobalLock().
<PRE>   If the buffer in more than 64K in size, make sure to type cast the
   return value from GlobalLock() to a huge pointer.


</PRE></OL>When you pass a pointer to a block that was allocated via GlobalAlloc()
from the 32-bit side, it costs no selectors. The translated pointer is
valid until the memory is freed.
<P>
For more information on how to share large amounts of data between the
16-bit and 32-bit side of an Universal Thunk under Win32s, please refer
