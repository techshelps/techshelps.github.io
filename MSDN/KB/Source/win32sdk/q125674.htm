The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows 95 version 4.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 supports a new set of APIs for 32-bit applications. These APIs
are exported by USER32, GDI32, KERNEL32, and so on. In Windows 95, some of
these new APIs are also exported by the 16-bit counterpart DLLs in the
system such as USER16, GDI16, and so on. But 16-bit applications running on
Windows 95 should not call these new APIs from the 16-bit system DLLs
because these calls are not unsupported and might be removed from the
16-bit system DLLs in the future.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
APIs such as WindowFromDC(), SetWindowRgn(), SetForeGroundWindow(), and so
on for 16-bit USER window management and PolyBezier(), PolyBezierTo(), and
so on for 16-bit GDI graphics management are exported from the 16-bit
system DLLs.
<P>
Even though these APIs are intended for 32-bit applications, the 16-bit
system DLLs export some of them. 16-bit Windows 95 Applications should not
call them. They are not supported and the APIs will not work as intended.
<P>
If Windows 95 Applications need to use these APIs, port the 16-bit
application to 32-bit. This is the best solution and is the one that
Microsoft recommends. One addtional solution is to write a 32-bit DLL that
actually calls the 32-bit API; then the 16-bit application can thunk into
this 32-bit DLL. However, Microsoft strongly discourages developers from
having applications thunk into sytem DLLs (16- or 32-bit).
