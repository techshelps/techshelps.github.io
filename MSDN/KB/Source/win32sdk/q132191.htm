The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows NT
   version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 95
   version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows Telephony Software Development Kit (TAPI SDK)
   version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
Several TAPI APIs, such as lineMakeCall and lineSetupConference, take the
address of a call handle as a parameter. Upon successful completion of
these APIs, the address pointed at is filled with the new call handle.
<P>
TAPI does not, however, fill this address until the application receives
the LINE_REPLY message indicating that the API completed successfully.
Thus, not only is the handle not valid until the LINE_REPLY, but the actual
address must still be valid when LINE_REPLY is received. It is recommended
that stack variables not be used because they will often go out of scope
before the LINE_REPLY message is received.
<P>
For example, this code fragment is incorrect:
<P>
<PRE>   func()
   {
       HCALL hCall;
   ...
       AsyncID = lineMakeCall(hLine, &amp;hCall, lpszDestAddress, 0, NULL);
   }

</PRE>Here, lineMakeCall is going to return an asynchronous ID that will
eventually have a matching LINE_REPLY message. However, by the time the
LINE_REPLY message is retrieved, hCall will not be a valid variable and
&amp;hCall will not be a valid pointer. Expect a general protection (GP) fault
or stack corruption.
<P>
In the following code, When LINE_REPLY for lineMakeCall is received,
&amp;g_hCall is still valid and is filled with a valid call handle:
<P>
<PRE>   HCALL g_hCall;
   func()
   {
   ...
       lineMakeCall(hLine, &amp;g_hCall, lpszDestAddress, 0, NULL);

       // g_hCall is *not* valid until LINE_REPLY is received
   }
</PRE>
