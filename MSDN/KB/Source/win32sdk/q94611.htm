<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was extracted from the Windows Help Authoring
Guide available on the Microsoft Developer's Network CD-ROM:
<P>
<PRE>   Placing Keywords in the Topic

   When the user goes to a topic by choosing a keyword from the Search
   dialog box, Help displays the selected topic in the main window,
   starting from the beginning of the topic. If the information related to
   the keyword is located in the middle or toward the end of the topic, the
   user may not be able to see the relevant information without scrolling
   the topic. This result may not be what you want.

   If you want users to be able to go directly to relevant information
   within a topic (and see it without scrolling), you can place additional
   keywords with the information you want users to find. Keywords placed
   within a topic function as spot references (similar to context-string
   spot references) because they index specific locations, or "spots,"
   within the topic. To access the spot-referenced material, users choose
   the keyword from the Search dialog box.

   In the Search dialog box, all keywords appear the same. The user cannot
   tell the difference between keywords placed at the beginning of the
   topic and those placed elsewhere in the topic. However, when the user
   goes to the topic, Windows Help uses the location of the keyword
   footnote as a reference point. If the keyword footnote is located in the
   middle of the topic, Help displays the topic as if the middle location
   were the "top" of the topic.

   NOTE:

   Because you cannot insert a title footnote in the middle of a topic, any
   keywords that you place in the middle of the topic use the main topic
   title in the Search dialog box.

   To define a keyword in the middle of the topic:

   1. Place the insertion point where you want to define the keyword. A
      keyword inserted anywhere except the beginning of the topic is
      treated as a spot reference.

   2. From the Insert menu, choose Footnote. The Footnote dialog box
      appears.

   3. Type an uppercase K as the custom footnote mark, and then choose OK.
      A superscript K appears in the text window, and the insertion point
      moves to the footnote window.

   4. Type the keyword(s) to the right of the K in the footnote window. Use
      only a single space between the K and the first keyword. Separate
      multiple keywords with a semicolon (;).
