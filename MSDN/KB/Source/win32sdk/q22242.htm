The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.1 and 3.0

<LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.5 and 3.51
    - Microsoft Windows 95 version 4.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When text is painted into a window, an area around the text is a
different color than the remainder of the window.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The area around the text is painted with a solid color while the
remainder of the window is painted using a dithered color.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To make the area around the text and the remainder of the window
have the same color, perform one of the following two steps:

<UL><LI>Use a solid color for the window background, and use the same
   color for the text background. To ensure that a color is a solid
   color, use the GetNearestColor function. This function returns
   the nearest solid color available to represent the specified
   color.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Call the SetBkMode function to specify TRANSPARENT mode for the
   text. Doing so prevents Windows from painting the area behind
   the text. The window background color shows through instead.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, when an application paints text into its window, Windows
fills the area around the character with the current background color.
Windows always uses a solid color for this purpose.
<P>
When an application registers a window class, it specifies a handle to
a brush that Windows uses to paint the window background. On some
output devices, brushes can create dithered colors. On one of these
devices, the area behind painted text might have a different color
than the remainder of the window.
<P>
The following code specifies the window background color:
<P>
<PRE>   #define ELANGREEN  0x003FFF00
   pTemplateClass-&gt;hbrBackground = CreateSolidBrush((DWORD)ELANGREEN);

</PRE>The following code specifies the color used to paint around text and
draws some text into a device context:
<P>
<PRE>   #define SZ -1
   SetBkColor(hDC, (DWORD)ELANGREEN);
   DrawText(hDC, (LPSTR)"text", SZ, (LPRECT)&amp;Rect, DT_BOTTOM);

</PRE>The color used to paint the area around the text has a yellow cast,
which gives it a slightly different appearance than the window
background color.
<P>
A brush may be able to represent a wider color range than the solid
colors because a brush covers an area while a solid color may be used
to paint nominal-width lines (for example, lines that are one device
unit wide) that must be the same color at all locations and angles.
Therefore, the device-driver writer has the option of providing
dithered colors for brushes, but has no such freedom when it comes to
the solid colors for drawing lines.
