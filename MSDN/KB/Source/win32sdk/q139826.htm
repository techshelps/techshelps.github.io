The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Video for Windows Development Kit (DK) version 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides tips you can use to help you compress AVI (audio-
video interleaved) files. This article should help to clarify the
information in the documentation. This article also provides hints
concerning the settings for Interleave, Compression Quality, Key Frame
Every, and Data Rate - all settings available in the Video Compression
Options dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Authoring/Compression Tips</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Don't capture on low or medium end equipment.

<LI>Avoid noise. Noise reduces the quality of the image and can effect the
   compression.

<LI>Use a low-pass filter such as the LOWPASS sample included with Visual
   C++ version 2.x and with the Win32 SDK to get rid of some of the audio
   noise.

<LI>Avoid compressing the movie more than once. Edit your uncompressed bits
   of video together before doing any compression, and then compress the
   final product. Editing always works faster with uncompressed video.
<P>
</UL><h3>Video Dimensions and Frame Rate</h3>
 
<P>
When authoring, consider that most display cards support up to 320x240x15
frames per second (fps). Larger images or faster frame rates increase the
importance of testing on multiple machines with multiple configurations (CD-
ROM drive speeds, video boards, display monitors, and so on).
<P>
<P><h3>Full Screen Playback</h3>
 
<P>
If your movie is 320x240 or less, you should get excellent full-screen
playback that can handle 15 fps regardless of the video card. If your movie
is bigger, it will play full screen, but performance may be poor. Test
across multiple configurations to help identify the impact of stretching on
various displays.
<P>
<P><h3>Video Compression Options</h3>
 
<P>
The following options are presented in the Compression Options dialog box.
To gain access to this dialog box, on the File menu, click Save Options in
SDK samples such as Aviedit and Aviview. Similar options are available
in the Videdit utility from Video for Windows by clicking Save As on the
File menu.
<P>
Interleave:
<P>
The interleave option places audio data physically between video frame data
in the AVI file to ensure the best performance and synchronization. For
example, with a 1:1 interleave setting, each frame of a 15 fps video would
have 1/15 seconds of audio data. This setting does not matter when editing
the file. When saving for playback, interleave every frame for best
playback performance. Interleaving multiple audio streams is not possible
using this option.
<P>
Compression Quality:
<P>
Use the highest quality number to get the best quality, but use the entire
allowable data rate. A lower quality may take up less than the requested
data rate.
<P>
Key Frame Every:
<P>
Normally, use the default key frame value for a particular codec. Fewer key
frames could give a little better picture quality, but if your system can't
keep up on playback, you'll stall for a longer time, and you won't degrade
as gracefully. More key frames means fewer frames skipped when playback
can't keep up.
<P>
Data Rate:
<P>
The minimum data rate that can be achieved on most computers is 100K/sec
for single spin CD-ROM drives, and 225K/sec for double spin CD-ROM drives.
Most computers can do more (150K and 300K for single and double speed
respectively).
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
The AVIMakeCompressedStream(), AVISave(), and AVISaveOptions() functions
use the AVICOMPRESSOPTIONS structure to specify some of the compression
options discussed in this article. The ICCompressorChoose() function
uses the COMPVARS structure for a similar purpose. See the documentation
for the products listed at the beginning of this article for more
information.
