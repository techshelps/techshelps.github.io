<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: The information contained in this article does not address TrueType
fonts. For information on TrueType fonts, please see chapter 18 of "Guide
to Programming" for the Windows SDK version 3.1.
<P>
In Windows version 3.0, there are two different ways that the graphical
device interface (GDI) can generate characters for a font. For a raster
font, GDI displays the font by copying bitmaps to the output device. For a
stroke font, GDI displays the font by drawing lines between a series of
points that describe each character. Each font is owned by either GDI or by
a specific device. Type and ownership information can be determined by
enumerating the fonts. This article discusses the two font types and two
font ownership types.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A raster font stores its characters as a series of bitmaps; a stroke font
stores its characters as a set of vector operations that describe the
characters. When a character from a raster font is drawn, the bitmap is
copied onto the device. When a character from a stroke font is displayed,
the lines are drawn connecting the points that describe the character.
Examples of raster fonts provided with Windows are Courier and Helv;
examples of stroke fonts are Script and Roman.
<P>
Raster fonts are only available in specific sizes. Some devices can scale
installed raster fonts to integer multiples of their size. Use the
GetDeviceCaps() function to determine whether the device has this
capability. The Windows GDI will scale its raster fonts as required
regardless of the device capability. Stroke fonts can be scaled to any size
and can also be rotated.
<P>
GDI fonts are owned by the GDI; they are available to all devices. Device
fonts are fonts that are owned by a particular device; they are available
only on that device.
<P>
By enumerating the fonts, an application can determine which ones are
raster or stroke fonts, and which are GDI or device fonts. The callback
function used with EnumFonts() has the parameter nFontType. As stated on
page 4-118 of the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit Reference
Volume 1," the bitwise AND (&amp;) operator can be used with the constants
RASTER_FONTTYPE and DEVICE_FONTTYPE to determine the font type. If the
RASTER_FONTTYPE bit is set, the font is a raster font; otherwise, it is a
stroke font. If the DEVICE_FONTTYPE bit is set, the font is owned by the
device that corresponds to the display context handle (HDC) used in the
EnumFont() call; otherwise it is a GDI font.
