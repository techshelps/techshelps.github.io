<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A Service does not receive the SERVICE_CONTROL_SHUTDOWN event. This could
cause a Service to not properly cleanup before the system shuts down.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Service Control Manager sends the SERVICE_CONTROL_SHTUDOWN event
synchronously to all Services one at a time. A Service only receives the
event when all Services that received the event ahead of it have finished
processing the event. A Service has processed the event when it returns
from its control handler function. If the previous Service does not process
the event, the following Services will never receive the event. The system
may shutdown before a Service receives the event, which causes a Service to
not execute code in its SERVICE_CONTROL_SHUTDOWN event handler.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you install a Console Control Handler, you can circumvent this problem.
The handler can intercept the CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT. This event is sent
asynchronously to all processes with a registered Console Control Handler.
Please refer to the Platform SDK Documentation for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. A
supported hotfix is now available, but it has not been fully regression
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely affected by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
