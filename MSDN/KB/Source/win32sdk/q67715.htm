The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0 and 3.1

<LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.5 and 3.51
    - Microsoft Windows 95 version 4.0
</UL></PRE>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If an application contains an owner-draw button that paints itself with a
bitmap, the application's resources must contain a set of bitmaps
appropriate to each display type on which the application might run.
<P>
If the application's resources do not contain bitmaps suitable for the
display on which the application is running, the application can use the
default 3-D button appearance by changing the button style to BS_PUSHBUTTON
from BS_OWNERDRAW.
<P>
Under Windows 95, there is a new style BS_BITMAP which applications might
find easier to use.
<P>
Changing the style of a button is possible in Windows version 3.0; however,
this technique is not guaranteed to be supported in future releases of
Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An owner-draw button can use bitmaps to paint itself. When an application
contains this type of owner-draw button, it must also contain a set of
bitmaps appropriate for each display type on which the application might
run. Each set of bitmaps has a normal "up" bitmap and a depressed "down"
bitmap to implement the 3-D effects. The most common standard Windows
display types are: CGA, EGA, VGA, 8514/a, and Hercules Monochrome. The
dimensions and aspect ratio of the display affect the appearance of the
bitmap. For example, a monochrome bitmap designed for VGA will display
correctly on an 8514/a and any other display with a 1:1 aspect ratio.
<P>
If an application determines that it does not contain an appropriate set of
bitmaps for the current display type, then it should change the button
style from BS_OWNERDRAW to BS_PUSHBUTTON. After the style has been changed
and the button has been redrawn, the button will appear as a normal 3-D
push button.
<P>
The following code fragment demonstrates how to change the style of a
push button from owner-draw to normal:
<P>
<PRE>    ...

    /*
     * hWndButton is assumed to be the handle to the button.
     * Note that lParam has a nonzero value, which forces the button
     * to be redrawn. This assures that the normal button appearance
     * will show after this message is sent.
     */
    SendMessage(hWndButton, BM_SETSTYLE, BS_PUSHBUTTON, 1L);

    ...
