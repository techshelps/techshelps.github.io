</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The VOICEMDI sample included in the Microsoft Speech SDK 1.0 does not check
for a Voice-Navigator application installed on the system. Also, it does
not observe the current setting of the UseSpeech registery entry. It is
written in the style of a test application and makes calls to
IVCmdAttributes::AwakeStateSet() and IVCmdAttributes::EnabledSet().
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
All applications on a given site that use voice commands or voice text
share the same attribute settings, so applications should not make changes
to these settings. Instead, applications should allow the user to change
these settings globally using a Voice-Navigator application and observe all
the current settings. However, the VOICEMDI sample does not do this;
instead, it calls the AwakeStateSet() and EnabledSet() member functions of
the IVCmdAttributes interface to modify the settings. Also, it doesn't look
for the WM_SPEECHSTARTED and WM_SPEECHENDED messages that notify
applications when the user has changed the global settings.
<P>
Although the VOICEMDI sample does not follow the guidelines, the CLOCK
sample included in the Speech SDK does this in part. The initialization
code in the InitState() function in Vcmd.cpp calls the GetVcmdState()
function, which checks the current setting of the UseSpeech registry entry.
InitState() also registers the messages WM_SPEECHSTARTED and
WM_SPEECHENDED, and the MainWndProc() function in Srclk.cpp shows where the
messages would be handled, although there is no implementation for the
message handling code.
<P>
For more information on this topic, click the Index button of the
"Microsoft Speech SDK Developer's Guide" (Speech.hlp), and then click the
Find tab of the Help Topics dialog box. Search for the voice-navigation or
UseSpeech.
