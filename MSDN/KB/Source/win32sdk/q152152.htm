<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The sample code provided contains a template that can used for writing
32-bit Microsoft Excel XLLs for Windows. This code demonstrates many of the
features of the Microsoft Excel C API. This sample was updated from the
Microsoft Excel Developer's Kit, version 5.

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from
               Online Services

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Creating Stand-alone DLLs (XLLs)</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel supports stand-alone DLLs. These are DLLs (or code
resources) that the user opens by choosing Open from the File menu and
selecting a DLL file or by using the Microsoft Excel Add-In Manager. The
user can also put DLL files in the Microsoft Excel Startup directory so
that they are opened at run time. By convention, stand-alone DLLs are
called XLLs. After the DLL is built, the DLL should be given a filename
with the extension .XLL. When using an XLL, the user never sees a macro
sheet or Add-In sheet. Therefore, an XLL must be able to do everything an
XLA (Add-In) can do. In particular, XLLs need a way to provide functions
that run automatically at open time, close time, and so on. When developing
an XLL, you need to:

<UL><LI>Define the interface to Microsoft Excel. An XLL should export a few
   functions that are called by Microsoft Excel and the Microsoft Excel
   Add-In Manager.

<LI>Define the user interface to the XLL. Does the XLL use pull-down menus,
   toolbars, or shortcut keys? Or does it only provide additional functions
   for use on worksheets?
<P>
</UL><h3>The Generic Template for XLLs</h3>
 
<P>
The sample code provided contains a template you can use for writing your
own 32-bit Microsoft Excel XLLs. This code demonstrates many of the
features of the Microsoft Excel C API. To see the generic Add-In code, open
GENERIC.C from the sample. When the compiled generic Add-In, GENERIC.XLL,
is opened in Microsoft Excel, it creates a new Generic menu with the four
Commands listed in the following table:
<P>
<PRE>   Command            Action
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   Dialog             Displays a Microsoft Excel dialog box
   Dance              Moves the selection around until you press ESC
   Native Dialog      Displays a Windows dialog box that was created
                      using the Windows API
   Exit               Closes GENERIC.XLL and removes the menu

</PRE>The generic Add-In also provides two functions, Func1 and FuncSum, that can
be used whenever the generic Add-In is open. These functions appear in the
Generic Add-In category in the Function Wizard. Also, these functions can
be registered without loading all of the generic Add-In. To do this, use
the following formulas:
<P>
<PRE>   =REGISTER("GENERIC.XLL","FUNC1")
   =REGISTER("GENERIC.XLL","FUNCSUM")

</PRE><h3>To Build</h3>
 
<P>
This project must be built as a 32-bit application. NMAKE can be used with
the attached makefile to build this project.
