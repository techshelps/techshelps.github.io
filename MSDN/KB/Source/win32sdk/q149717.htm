<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When attempting to jump to a subtopic, MediaView may jump to the enclosing
topic but will not correctly scroll the media view to the location of the
subtopic.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In order to jump to a subtopic, you must acquire a virtual address (VA) for
that topic. To get this, you might call vaMVConvertContextString() which
will convert a context string to a VA. Then you would pass the VA to
fMVSetAddress() which would cause the jump to occur.
<P>
The problem is that context strings are not in and of themselves guaranteed
to be allocated a new VA. Normally, when this problem occurs it is
happening because the subtopic is getting assigned the same VA as either a
preceding subtopic or perhaps the topic itself. The end result is that the
media view gets scrolled to an unexpected location.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To ensure that a new VA is generated for each context string, you must
ensure that the context string resides in a new paragraph and that it has
some paragraph formatting that is distinct from the previous paragraph.
<P>
Paragraph formatting includes: justification, first-line indent, spacing,
borders, keep-with-next, and keep-together. In addition, tab stops are also
considered part of paragraph formatting (at least for the purpose of
determining VAs). Font changes are classified as character formatting and
will not affect VA generation.
<P>
One simple solution to ensure that a new VA is created for each subtopic is
to insert a phantom tab stop for each new subtopic. Just be sure that the
tab stop is different from the preceding paragraph.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In MediaView, you can include subtopics within a given topic by arbitrarily
inserting a pound-sign (#) footnote to mark the location of the subtopic.
Jumps to subtopics should cause a jump to the enclosing topic with the
media view scrolled to the point where the subtopic context string was
authored.
