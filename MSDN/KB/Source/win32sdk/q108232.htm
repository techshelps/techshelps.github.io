<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:

<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.5 and 3.51
    - Microsoft Windows 95 version 4.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Under Windows NT, system hooks are limited in two situations: hooking
console windows and hooking the desktop.
<P>
Because of the current design of the console and the fact that its user
interface runs in the Win32 server, Windows NT does not support hook calls
in the context of console applications. Thus, if application A sets a
system-wide input hook and text is typed in a console window, application
A's input hook will not be called. The same is true for every type of
Windows hook except for journal record and journal playback hooks.
<P>
Hooking a console application will be enabled in Windows NT 3.51.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT supports journaling by forcing the console input thread to
communicate with the application that set the hook. In the case of a
console, the call to the hook functions are run in the context of the
application that installed the hook. This forces Windows NT to
synchronously talk to this process in order for it to work; if this process
is busy or blocked (as it is when it is sitting at a breakpoint), the
console thread is hung.
<P>
If console applications were typical Win32-based applications, then this
would not be a problem. A design change such as this would require that
each console take an extra thread just to process input. This was not
acceptable to the designers, and therefore console applications are not
implemented in the same way that other Win32-based applications are
implemented.
<P>
Similarly, if Windows NT allowed other hooks to freely hook any process,
then these processes could enter a hanging state as well. The reason that
journaling is allowed to hook consoles is that journaling already requires
synchronization between all processes in the system, and a mechanism to
disengage the journaling process (via the CTRL+ESC, ALT+ESC and
CTRL+ALT+DEL keystroke combinations) is provided to prevent hanging the
system message queue.
<P>
For similar reasons, 16-bit Windows-based applications cannot hook
Win32-based applications under Windows NT.
<P>
The issues above apply equally well to hooking the desktop. If an
application were allowed to hook the desktop, it could potentially hang it.
This is completely unacceptable and violates one of the design principles
of Windows NT: no application should be allowed to bring down the system or
hang the user interface.
