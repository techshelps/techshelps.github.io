<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) specifications are
published by and copyrighted material of the MIDI Manufacturers Association
(MMA). Certain of these specifications are useful to Windows developers who
author MIDI files for playback or who write software to record MIDI data or
play it back without relying on Windows MCI support. However, the
specifications are not available from Microsoft. They must be obtained from
the MMA or its distributors.
<P>
As of November 1995, the MMA provides all MIDI specifications (including
several more specialized ones not listed in this article) in a single
document. It may be obtained by ordering item #3535 from the Mix Bookshelf,
which can be contacted at 800-233-9604. For current information and other
questions, please contact the MMA at the following address or phone
numbers:

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Following are several of the specifications that are of the greatest
general interest to multimedia application developers. The term "low-level
MIDI" refers to the midiXXX functions, as opposed to MCI services.
<P>
Knowledge of these specifications is not necessary to implement playback of
MIDI files using MCI services because the MCI driver shields applications
from these details.
<P>
<P><h3>MIDI Detailed Specification (for Low-Level MIDI Development)</h3>
 
<P>
The MIDI Detailed Specification explains the MIDI hardware and software
protocols and is of interest to developers of multimedia applications that
implement MIDI support using low-level MIDI APIs to record, edit, or play
MIDI data.
<P>
<P><h3>Standard MIDI Files 1.0 (for Low-Level MIDI Development)</h3>
 
<P>
The Standard MIDI Files specification defines a way to interchange time-
stamped MIDI data between different applications on the same or different
hardware platforms. This is useful to developers writing applications that
read and parse disk files containing MIDI data or that write MIDI data
files to disk.
<P>
<P><h3>General MIDI System - Level 1 (for MIDI File Authoring)</h3>
 
<P>
The General MIDI (GM) specification defines a minimum MIDI configuration of
a "General MIDI System" consisting of a certain class of MIDI playback
devices. It is of interest to multimedia developers who author MIDI files.
Most PC sound cards and MIDI synthesizers manufactured today are compatible
with the GM specification. MIDI files that are authored to the GM
specification should generally sound like they were intended to sound no
matter which GM-compatible device they are played on.
