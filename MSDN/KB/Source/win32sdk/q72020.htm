The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.1 and 3.0

<LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:

<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.5 and 3.51
    - Microsoft Windows 95 version 4.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
There are three stroke (or vector) fonts packaged with Windows versions 3.0
and 3.1 and Windows NT: Roman, Script, and Modern. These fonts are marked
as belonging to the OEM character set when, in fact, they belong to the
ANSI character set. NOTE: Windows 95 provides only the Modern vector font.
The Roman and Script fonts are included in the True Type fonts shipped with
the system.
<P>
The OEM character set is the character set used by the hardware device on
which Windows is running (for example, the IBM PC). The IBM PC OEM
character set and ANSI character set are listed in "Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit Reference Volume 2" for the Windows SDK version
3.0 and in "Programmer's Reference, Volume 3: Messages, Structures, and
Macros" for the Windows SDK version 3.1.
<P>
The fonts were marked in this manner for two reasons. First, in previous
versions of Windows, the stroke fonts did include non-ANSI characters.
Second, mismarking the character set ensures proper font mapping. The
character-set attribute of a font is assigned a very high penalty weight in
the font mapping scheme. If stroke fonts were not marked as using the OEM
character set, a stroke font might be chosen by the font mapper [during a
SelectObject() call] instead of a raster font when a requested raster font
size is not available. This behavior occurs because most raster fonts
belong to the ANSI character set, character size has much lower penalty
weight than character set, and stroke fonts can be scaled to any desired
size. Some raster fonts can be scaled; however, they can be scaled only to
specific sizes.
