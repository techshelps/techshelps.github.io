<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Hangeul (Korean) Windows supports the KSC5601-1987 code set, which consists
of several thousands Hangeul characters. The Hangeul Windows IME (Input
Method Editor) allows the user to enter Hangeul Jamos (24 basic components
of Hangeul characters), compose the final characters, and send them to
applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When running Hangeul Windows, you will see a small window with three
buttons in the lower-left corner:

<UL><LI>The left button toggles between the Roman "A" character and the Korean
   character that is pronounced "GA," which Windows uses to symbolize
   Korean characters.

<LI>The center button is a graphic of a half box or full box, which selects
   SBCS or DBCS storage (or display) of Roman (but not Hangeul) characters.
   Hangeul characters always take up a double-byte space, unlike some
   Japanese characters (katakana).

<LI>The right button is the "Hangeul to Hanja" converter.
<P>
</UL>You can type in English by having the Roman toggle selected. To try typing
Hangeul, the main thing to remember is that there is no apparent logical
connection between the US 101 keyboard and what the you end up typing.
To type like a pro, you need Korean keycaps, a cheat sheet, or a lot of
memory in your brain.
<P>
For example, to type the word "Hangeul" type these characters:
<P>
<PRE>   GKS   RMF

</PRE>(Please ignore the spaces between the two characters.) Notice how each
group of three keyboard characters assemble a single Hangeul character.
Hangeul is often made up of three components (called "Jamos"), but
characters can actually be composed of from two to several Jamos.
<P>
Here is how to type "Seoul, Korea."  Seoul is pronounced locally "sa-ul,"
so try typing these characters:
<P>

</PRE>(Please ignore the spaces between the characters.) The word "Korea" is not
a Korean name; it is the English equivalent, just as Japan is really
Nippon. The word "Korea" in Korean is "Han-guk," so "Seoul, Hanguk" would
be:
<P>
<PRE>   TJD NF    GKS RNR

</PRE>The reason to try "Hanguk" instead of "Korea" is that Hanguk can also be
spelled with Chinese characters. Put the mouse pointer (cursor) on the left
edge of "Han" and click the "Hangeul to Hanja" button. A list box appears.
Select choice #1 by typing 1 or by selecting it with the mouse. Do the same
for the next character, again selecting choice #1. Then it will display
in Hanja.
<P>
Most Korean text is in Hangeul not Hanja, notice the 3.1-H readme is all
Hangeul. Hanja is still used in Korea - sometimes.
