The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Platform Software Development Kit (SDK)
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The header files of the Platform SDK now include _WIN32_WINNT guards. This
constant should be defined in your makefile (either app specific, or for
the whole project) so that you can take advantage of features that are
specific to Windows NT. In the Platform SDK, _WIN32_WINNT is defined in
Win32.mak (conditionally, depending on the platform you are targetting).
More information about _WIN32_WINNT is provided in the release notes for
the Platform SDK.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are several features of Windows NT 4.0 that are not in previous
version of Windows NT or in Windows 95. If you are developing code that
uses the advanced features of the operating system, then you should define
the _WIN32_WINNT constant to be 0x0400 (or greater for future features).
<P>
A partial list of areas that are affected by this definition is:
<P>
<PRE>   Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM),
   several new window messages (WM_MOUSEWHEEL for instance),
   Waitable Timer API's,
   CopyFileEx API's,
   Fiber API's,
   FindFirst/NextFileEx API's.

</PRE>Search the Platform SDK header files for a complete reference of the
portions of the SDK that are affected by this definition.
<P>
For instance, placing the following in your source code will include the
proper function prototypes and constant definitions for your code to use
the advanced components of Windows NT:
<P>
<PRE>   #define _WIN32_WINNT 0x0400
   #include &lt;windows.h&gt;

</PRE>You may also make the definition in the makefile or project settings so
that all source files can take advantage of the advanced components.
<P>
Keep in mind that making this definition and using advanced components of
the operating system makes your code usable only on Windows NT 4.0 or
later. If you want to make your code compatible with all Win32 platforms,
then you should not use this definition or use the advanced features unless
the code is running on a platform that supports the features. You may check
the version of Windows programmatically and link dynamically to the proper
API's if you detect that the platform supports them. This allows your code
to degrade to more basic functionality if the advanced features of the
operating system are not available.
