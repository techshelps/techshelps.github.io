The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows NT
   versions 3.1 and 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>When the /zi option is used with the Win32 DSKLAYT2.EXE to provide
   compression, it causes an access violation.

<P><LI>The Win32 Setup Toolkit does not contain a setup bootstrapper to
   copy the needed setup files to a temp drive and run the Setup
   program. Setup runs from floppy disks.

<P><LI>Install programs for applications that may run on Win32s must be
   created with the 16-bit version of the Setup Toolkit if the
   installation program will install Win32s. However, the 16-bit
   DSKLAY2.EXE cannot read the version information in a Win32 binary.

<P><LI>The Win32 DSKLAYT.EXE only shows 8.3 names in the list box.

<P><LI>The Setup program reports "out of memory" during installation, but there
   seems to be plenty of memory.

<P><LI>Installation fails from a CD-ROM. If the same files are copied from the
   CD to the hard disk, installation succeeds.

<P><LI>Setup programs created with the 32-bit setup toolkit will not run under
   Win32s.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTIONS</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>The fix for this problem is available in the Alpha SDK Update and later.
<P>
   Note that COMPRESS.EXE has been updated to use a better compression
   algorithm, and therefore /zi is no longer recommended for best
   compression. The option has been kept for compatibility reasons.

<P><LI>The bootstrapper is not necessary in a 32-bit environment. It is
   required for Windows because it is not possible to remove the
   floppy disk of a currently running Win16 application (the resources
   could not all be preloaded and locked).

<P><LI>If a Win32s installation is provided on a separate disk, the
   install program can be developed with the Win32 Setup Toolkit.

<P><LI>The program is actually a 16-bit program, and therefore it can
   display only the 8.3 name. Use 8.3 names for the source names and
   specify that the files be renamed (using the long names) when they
   are installed.

<P><LI>This error can be caused when a DLL on disk 1 is needed when
   when a different disk is currently inserted. To work around this
   problem, use LoadLibrary() to load the DLL.

<P><LI>This problem was corrected in the Win32 3.5 SDK.

<P><LI>This problem was corrected in the Win32 3.5 SDK.
