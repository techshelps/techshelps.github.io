The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
   - Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Win32 applications on two different Windows 95 machines open a remote file
for reading and writing. One writes data to the file, but the other does
not see the newly-written data.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks and the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks included with Windows 95 cache both reads and writes
to remote files unless the files are locked. Since a Windows 95 client
machine may contain cached data that has not been synchronized with the
server, applications running on the client may not see the file as it
actually exists on the server.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design in Windows 95. The reason for this behavior is
to reduce network traffic, thereby improving network performance.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Win32 applications that run on Windows 95 and share remote files with
clients on other machines must lock the regions they read or write. When a
Win32 application locks the file it is accessing, the Windows 95 network
client does not cache reads or writes to the locked region. Thus, the Win32
application will see the contents of the file as it exists on the server,
and will write new data directly to the file on the server.
<P>
In general, locking remote files that can be shared is good design because
it prevents the file's contents from becoming corrupt when applications
running on multiple machines access it simultaneously.
<P>
To lock a remote file, Win32 applications should use the LockFile API if
they open the file with CreateFile or OpenFile. If an application uses a
runtime library for opening the file, it should lock the file with the
appropriate runtime library functions. For example, an application that
uses the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime library _open() function should use
the corresponding _locking() function to lock a region of the file.
