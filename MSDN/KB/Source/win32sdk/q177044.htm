The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
   - Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In some situations, Windows does not properly handle fonts when converting
from an enhanced metafile (EMF) to a normal Windows metafile (WMF). The
result is that the converted WMF does not exactly match the original EMF.
The fonts might have different sizes and different rotations.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the size problem, record the metafile using only positive
font heights. To work around the rotation direction problem, record the
metafile using a mapping mode in which positive y is down.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Font Height</h3>
 
<P>
The font height problem occurs because Windows converts all font heights to
positive values during the conversion from EMF to WMF. For example, a font
recorded with a height of -100 is converted to a font with a height of
+100. As a result, a slightly different sized font appears because negative
heights are interpreted as character heights while positive heights are
interpreted as cell heights.
<P>
<P><h3>Font Rotation</h3>
 
<P>
The font rotation direction problem occurs because Windows does not
properly handle rotated fonts when the metafile is in an inverted mapping
mode. During EMF to WMF conversion, rotated fonts are rotated the wrong way
when you use an inverted mapping mode. For example, converting an EMF that
was recorded in MM_HIMETRIC and contains a rotated font, results in a WMF
with the font rotated the other way.
