The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<PRE>  - Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.50, 3.51, 4.0
  - Microsoft Windows 95
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses how the Winsock implementation of TCP on the various
Microsoft platforms handles socket connections to ports that do not have a
server listening to them. It also describes the performance-related
considerations and how to adjust them to suit your needs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a process creates a TCP socket in the Microsoft Winsock layer and
issues a connect() call to some host and port number, the TCP protocol
performs its standard "three-way handshake" of a SYN packet, acknowledged
by the target host with ACK/SYN, and a final ACK from the initiating
client. However, per the TCP specifications stated in RFC-793 (Transmission
Control Protocol), a reset (RST) might be generated if the SYN attempt is
addressed to a host which exists but the port is unused. This is best
described by the following RFC quote from page 35:
<P>
<PRE>   Reset Generation

   As a general rule, reset (RST) must be sent whenever a segment arrives
   which apparently is not intended for the current connection.  A reset
   must not be sent if it is not clear that this is the case ...

   If the connection does not exist (CLOSED) then a reset is sent
   in response to any incoming segment except another reset.  In particular
   SYNs addressed to a non-existent connection are rejected by this means.

   Reset Processing [page 36]

   ... In the SYN-SENT state (a RST received in response
   to an initial SYN), the RST is acceptable if the ACK field
   acknowledges the SYN.

</PRE>Upon receiving the ACK/RST client from the target host, the client
determines that there is indeed no service listening there. In the
Microsoft Winsock implementation of TCP, a pending connection will keep
attempting to issue SYN packets until a maximum retry value is reached (set
in the registry, this value defaults to 3 extra times). Since an ACK/RST
was received from the target host, the TCP layer knows that the target host
is indeed reachable and will not double the time-out value in the packet's
IP header, as is standard during connection attempts with unacknowledged
SYNs. Instead, the pending connection will wait for the base connection's
time-out value and reissue another SYN packet to initiate a connection. As
long as an ACK/RST packet from an unused port is received, the time-out
value will not increase and the process will repeat until the maximum retry
value is reached.
<P>
This behavior may result in poor performance if for some reason a process
repeatedly issues connect() calls to ports with nothing listening there,
resulting in the error WSAECONNREFUSED. Note that with other
implementations of TCP, such as those commonly found in many UNIX systems,
the connect() fails immediately upon the receipt of the first ACK/RST
packet, resulting in the awareness of an error very quickly. However, this
behavior is not specified in the RFCs and is left to each implementation to
decide. The approach of Microsoft platforms is that the system
administrator has the freedom to adjust TCP performance-related settings to
their own tastes, namely the maximum retry that defaults to 3. The
advantage of this is that the service you're trying to reach may have
temporarily shut down and might resurface in between SYN attempts. In this
case, it's convenient that the connect() waited long enough to obtain a
connection since the service really was there.
<P>
You can adjust the TCP performance-related values on Microsoft platforms.
For WinNT, it is recommended that you obtain the white paper "Microsoft
Windows NT Server: TCP/IP Implementation Details," which is available
from:
<P>
<PRE>   ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-docs/papers/tcpipimp2.doc

</PRE>It contains the complete listing of NT TCP registry values. Of particular
interest is the key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
   Key         : TcpMaxConnectRetransmissions
   Value Type  : REG_DWORD - Number
   Valid Range : 0 - 0xFFFFFFFF
   Default     : 3
   Description : This parameter determines the number of times TCP will
                 retransmit a connect request (SYN) before aborting the
                 attempt. The retransmission time-out is doubled with each
                 successive retransmission in a given connect attempt
                 (except in the situation discussed above). The initial
                 time-out value is three seconds (since an ACK/RST was
                 received in the case above, this is irrelevant).

</PRE>For additional information on the Windows 95 TCP registry entries, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q158474.htm">Q158474</A></B>
   TITLE     : INFO: Winsock TCP connection performance to unused ports

</PRE>Of particular interest is the key:
<P>
<PRE>   Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP
   Key         : MaxConnectRetries
   Value Type  : DWORD - 32 bit number
   Default     : 3
   Description : Specifies the number of times a connection attempt (SYN)
                 will be retransmitted before giving up. The initial
                 retransmission time-out is 3 seconds (irrelevant in
                 the above case), and it is doubled each time (the
                 case above is an exception) up to a maximum of 2 minutes.

</PRE>You need to reboot after adjusting these registry values.
<P>
WARNING: Modifying these values affects any and all TCP outgoing connection
requests from the affected machine. If all of the TCP activity on the
machine has little latency and little distance to travel round-trip,
reducing this as low as zero (though not recommended) will make no
difference. However, should applications or connection attempts fail with
great regularity with the standard Winsock errors and the target remote
servers are known to be available, these registry entries should be
suspect. If this is the case you may be required to raise the maximum
retries some such that TCP will double the SYN packet's time-to-live value
in its IP header at successive retries until it has a long enough life-span
to reach the target host and receive an ACK/SYN.
