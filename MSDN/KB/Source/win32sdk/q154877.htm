OpenGL 1.1 Release for Windows 95

<OL><P><LI> OpenGL Functionality Notes
</OL>2.  Redistributable components for Windows 95
<P>
<P><h3>Functionality Notes</h3>
 
<P>
The OpenGL API is supported on a variety of graphics hardware; the software
in this release provides support for graphics hardware including basic
emulation on any video adapter that is supported with the operating system,
and accelerated graphics hardware that is supported by an OpenGL mini-
client driver (MCD) or an OpenGL installable client driver (ICD). This
release of OpenGL will run on all supported hardware under Windows 95,
including VGA and Super VGA 16 color mode displays.
<P>
The OpenGL run-time libraries for Windows 95 are not bundled with the
Windows 95 operating system currently, but application developers may
freely redistribute from this SDK along with their applications to other
Windows 95 systems. In addition, the run-time libraries have been bundled
with the Windows 95 operating system in the OEM system release 2, so OEM
Windows 95 systems shipping later in 1996 will begin appearing with the
OpenGL run-time libraries included.
<P>
To achieve good shaded rendering with OpenGL applications, you should use a
color graphics mode with 256 or more colors. Reasonable shading is possible
for most OpenGL applications with 256 colors.
<P>
The Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 95 releases of OpenGL includes new
functionality and performance enhancements. These include:

<OL><P><LI>A complete implementation of OpenGL 1.1. OpenGL 1.1 contains several
   functions, including vertex array, polygon offset, logic ops, and
   several new functions for handling textures. The vertex array and
   texture calls are particularly significant, as they may enable order of
   magnitude performance improvements in some applications.

<P><LI>Overlay planes extensions. These Microsoft OpenGL extensions permit
   applications to manage and render into overlay planes where supported in
   the graphics hardware. This permits applications to bring up dialog
   boxes and other UI features without overwriting 3D renderings.

<P><LI>Extended metafile support. Applications may encapsulate OpenGL calls and
   data in GDI extended metafiles. This, together with NT 4.0 print spooler
   enhancements for remote metafile rendering, makes it possible to print
   OpenGL graphics at high resolution on the print server. This feature is
   limited to the Windows NT release.

<P><LI>Microsoft extensions. The Microsoft OpenGL implementation also supports
   these performance extensions: GL_WIN_swap_hint, GL_EXT_bgra, and
   GL_EXT_paletted_texture. They improve the performance of some
   applications significantly.

<P><LI>Performance. The software renderer has been tuned for this release.
   Performance tuning has been carried out for the front end of the OpenGL
   pipeline as well as for rendering particular primitives, especially
   anti-aliased lines and texturing. Software rendering is generally 2-4x
   faster.

<P><LI>OpenGL hardware acceleration. This release of OpenGL supports a simpler
   mini-client driver (MCD) model to accelerate 3D graphics operations. In
   particular, Windows NT 4.0 includes a Matrox Millennium mini-client
   driver that accelerates OpenGL functions. A corresponding driver for
   Windows 95 is expected to be available later this year.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>Redistributable components for Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
The OpenGL redistributable components for Windows 95 are in the DLL
directory. It contains the run-time dynamic-link libraries for OpenGL and
GLU. We recommend either of two methods for redistributing these libraries
with your application on Windows 95 (for Windows NT, the libraries are
bundled with the operating system and should not be redistributed):

<OL><P><LI>In your setup program, install these libraries in the application
   directory along with your application. This gives you greater control
   over the version of OpenGL that your application will link to (an issue
   if other applications install other versions of the library), but also
   gives you greater responsibility for updating your customers' libraries
   if and when that is required to address defects, add functionality,
   improve performance, etc.

<P><LI>In your setup program, install these libraries in the windows system
   directory. If you do this, you should use the Win32 setup API call
   VerInstallFile to help prevent installing an older version of the
   libraries over another application's installation of a more recent
   version of the libraries.
