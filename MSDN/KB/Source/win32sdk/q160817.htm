<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
GLTEXTUR.EXE provides a demonstration of how to use a Device-independent
Bitmap (DIB) as a texture-map for OpenGL by pasting a DIB (chosen by the
user) onto three different OpenGL objects.
<P>
GLTex allows you to modify texture settings so you can see quickly and
easily the visual effect created.
<P>

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
OpenGL for Windows NT and Windows 95 supports powerful texture-mapping
capabilities. GLTex lets you experiment easily with most of these
capabilities and immediately see the effect on-screen.
<P>
The new GL_BGRA_EXT image format makes using DIBs as textures easy because
BGR is the same ordering used for DIBs. For convenience's sake, GLTex
converts all DIBs it reads into 32-bpp DIBs (by calling StretchDIBits).
This makes the DIB handling and texture handling much cleaner throughout
the sample. OpenGL textures require that the image used be of size 2^n
by 2^n. GLTex's ScaleDIB function performs the conversion to 32-bpp and
scales the image to a square one of size 2^n by 2^n.
<P>
When the OpenGL scene is rendered, three simple three-dimensional shapes
are drawn with the converted and scaled texture mapped onto *each* face.
This mapping is handled (initially) by the glTexCoord function, which is
called as the shape vertices are specified. The drawing of the shapes is
handled by GLTex's BuildShapes function.
<P>
<P><h3>Settings</h3>
 
<P>
Once you have loaded a DIB and see how it maps to the shape faces, GLTex
allows you to change the texture mapping settings in order to see how these
changes would effect the image. The following list gives modifications that
GLTex allows you to make, a brief description of their effect, and explains
which functions are used to change them:

<UL><LI>"Scene Distance from Viewer" allows you to push the scene farther away
   or bring it closer. This is achieved with glTranslate.

<LI>"Shape Rotation" allows you to modify the angle of rotation around the
   x, y, and z axes. This is achieved with glRotate for each axis.

<LI>"Light Position" allows you to move the single light source used. Note
   that by changing the w coordinate, you can modify whether you are using
   a directional (w = 0.0) or positional (w = 1.0) light source. This is
   achieved with glLight(...GL_POSITION...).

<LI>"Texture Mode" allows you to use two of the three texture modes
   available with OpenGL. Decal mode essentially means that the texture is
   applied directly to the object without any calculation of material
   properties or lighting. Modulate mode blends the underlying object
   (that is effected by material properties and lighting) with the
   texture. This gives the effect of a lighted texture. The third
   possibility, Blending, doesn't make sense for a three-component (RGB)
   image. This is achieved with glTexEnv.

<LI>"Perspective Hint" should be changed to Nicest if the texture appears to
   be projected incorrectly. You should try it anyway because it will allow
   you to see the difference. This is achieved with glHint.

<LI>"Minification Filter" controls how a screen pixel should be mapped to a
   collection of texels (texture elements). This is achieved with
   glTexParameter(...GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER...).

<LI>"Magnification Filter" controls how a screen pixel should be mapped to a
   portion of a texel (texture element). This is achieved with
   glTexParameter(...GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER...).

<LI>"Texture Wrap S" and "Texture Wrap T" allow you to specify whether the
   image should repeat in the S and T directions. (These can be thought of
   as the X and Y directions in the texture's world.) This is achieved with
   glTexParameter(...GL_TEXTURE_&lt;S or T&gt;_WRAP...).

<LI>"Texture Coordinates" specifies how the texture is mapped to the object.
   Because 0.0 is the default for the first parameter, one side of the
   texture is always mapped to the edge of the cube's face. This should be
   used in conjunction with Texture Wrap S and T for repeating the texture
   across the cube's faces. This is achieved with glTexCoord.

<LI>"Sphere Complexity" allows you to modify the number of faces used to
   create the sphere. Initially the complexity is 0, which is a very rough
   20-sided approximation of a sphere. You can increase this to a point,
   but keep in mind the complexity increases rapidly and can slow down
   the rendering (especially when spinning the objects). See GLSphere.c
   for the details.

<LI>"Transparency" allows you to choose an RGB color that you would like to
   treat as transparent for the chosen texture. An alpha function is set up
   to let you see through the texture onto the underlying object where this
   color exists. Because it is difficult to chose one exact color to use,
   you can modify how exact the color-matching should be. No variance means
   only the exact RGB color is made transparent, while total variance means
   all colors are treated as transparent.

<LI>"S Generation" and "T Generation" allow you to instruct OpenGL to ignore
   the texture coordinates specified for the individual shape faces by
   GLTexCoord, and generate textures based on a mode (Object Linear, Eye
   Linear, or Sphere Map) and a plane (specified by X, Y, Z, W). You can
   achieve some interesting effects quickly by playing with texture
   coordinate generation. Note that you will probably want to keep "Texture
   Wrap S" and "Texture Wrap T" set to repeat. Also, spinning the objects
   is often the easiest way to see what has been affected.

<LI>"Spin!" speaks for itself. Keep in mind that the "Shape Rotation"
   setting is a constant that "Spin!" doesn't modify. Also, depending on
   the speed of your processor and video card, the spinning objects can
   become quite slow if you have lots of effects turned on at once.

Some code for this GLTex sample was borrowed from the ShowDIB sample for
DIB-handling (Dib.c) and from Dale Rogerson's articles/samples for OpenGL
palette creation (Glpalette.c). The DIB code has been enhanced in order
to handle the loading of 16-bpp and 32-bpp DIBs.
