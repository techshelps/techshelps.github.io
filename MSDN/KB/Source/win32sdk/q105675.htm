Structured exception handling (SEH) takes a little getting used to,
particularly when debugging. It is common practice to use SEH as a
signaling mechanism. Some application programming interfaces (APIs)
register an exception handler in anticipation of a failure condition that
is expected to occur in a lower layer. When the exception occurs, the
handler may correct or ignore the condition rather than allowing a failure
to propagate up through intervening layers. This is very handy in complex
environments such as networks where partial failures are expected and it is
not desirable to fail an entire operation simply because one of several
optional parts failed. In this case, the exception can be handled so that
the application is not aware that an exception has occurred.
<P>
However, if the application is being debugged, it is important to realize
that the debugger will see all exceptions before the program does. This is
the distinction between the first and second chance exception. The debugger
gets the "first chance," hence the name. If the debugger continues the
exception unhandled, the program will see the exception as usual. If the
program does not handle the exception, the debugger will see it again (the
"second chance"). In this latter case, the program normally would have
crashed had the debugger not been present.
<P>
If you do not want to see the first chance exception in the debugger, then
disable the feature. Otherwise, during execution, when the debugger gets
the first chance, continue the exception unhandled and allow the program to
handle the exception as usual. Check the documentation for the debugger
that you are using for descriptions of the commands to be used.
