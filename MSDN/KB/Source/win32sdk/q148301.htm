<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The GLTex sample (GLTEXTUR.EXE) provides a demonstration of how to use a
DIB (device-independent bitmap) as a texture-map for OpenGL by pasting a
DIB (chosen by the user) onto all sides of a three-dimensional cube.
<P>
GLTex also allows you to modify various texture settings so that you can
quickly and easily see the visual effect created.

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
OpenGL for Windows NT and Windows 95 support powerful texture-mapping
capabilities. GLTex lets you easily experiment with many (but not all) of
these capabilities by using a series of conversions to generate the texture
map. It allows the user to modify various OpenGL settings.
<P>
To use a DIB as a texture in OpenGL, you must first convert the DIB into a
format that is compatible with OpenGL. Because a 32-bpp DIB is the most
closely related to an OpenGL formatted image, you can take the DIB that the
user provides and regardless of its format copy it by using StretchDIBits
onto a 32-bpp DIB Section. Therefore, from this point on, GLTex can assume
that it is working with a 32-bpp DIB Section.
<P>
Note that because a 32-bpp DIB is used, you don't have to worry about the
DWORD-alignment of DIBs. 32-bit DIBs are already DWORD-aligned. After
ensuring that you have a 32-bpp DIB Section, you must convert that DIB
Section into an OpenGL image. This involves converting the BGR format of
the DIB into the RGBA format that OpenGL uses. This translation from an
"any format DIB" into an OpenGL image is handled by GLTex's DIBtoGLImage
function.
<P>
Now that you have an OpenGL image, you must scale it to a format that is
2^n x 2^n. This is required for OpenGL textures. (There is one exception to
this rule involving texture borders, but GLTex does not use borders.) You
might want to chose to always scale the image to be square because you're
mapping onto cube faces. Then GLTex scales the image sides to the closest
2^n by using the utility function gluScaleImage. Finally, this scaled image
is set as the texture-image by calling glTexImage2D. This scaling and
setting of the texture is handled by GLTex's GLImagetoTexture function.
<P>
When the OpenGL scene is rendered, a simple three-dimensional cube is drawn
with the converted and scaled texture mapped onto it. This mapping is taken
care of by the glTexCoord function, which is called as the cube vertices
are specified. This is handled by GLTex's BuildCube function.
<P>
<P><h3>Settings</h3>
 
<P>
Once you have loaded a DIB and see how it maps to the cube's sides, GLTex
allows you to change several settings in order to see how these changes
would effect the image. The following list gives modifications that GLTex
allows you to make, a brief description of their effect, and which
functions are used to change them:

<UL><LI>"Scene Distance from Viewer" allows you to push the scene farther away
   or bring it closer in. This is achieved with glTranslate.

<LI>"Cube Rotation" allows you to modify the angle of rotation around the x,
   y, and z axes. This is achieved with glRotate for each axis.

<LI>"Light Position" allows you to move the single light source used. Note
   that by changing the w coordinate, you can modify whether you are using
   a directional (w = 0.0) or positional (w = 1.0) light source. This is
   achieved with glLight(...GL_POSITION...).

<LI>"Texture Mode" allows you to use two of the three texture modes
   available with OpenGL. Decal mode essentially means that the texture is
   applied directly to the object without any calculation of material
   properties or lighting. Modulate mode blends the underlying object
   (which is effected by material properties and lighting) with the
   texture. This gives the effect of a lighted texture. The third
   possibility, Blending, doesn't make sense for a three-component (RGB)
   image. This is achieved with glTexEnv.

<LI>"Perspective Hint" should be changed to Nicest if the texture appears to
   be projected incorrectly. You should try it anyway because it will allow
   you to see the difference. This is achieved with glHint.

<LI>"Minification Filter" controls how a screen pixel should be mapped to a
   collection of texels (texture elements). This is achieved with
   glTexParameter(...GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER...).

<LI>"Magnification Filter" controls how a screen pixel should be mapped to a
   portion of a texel (texture element). This is achieved with
   glTexParameter(...GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER...).

<LI>"Texture Wrap S" and "Texture Wrap T" allow you to specify whether the
   image should repeat in the S and T directions (these can be thought of
   as the X and Y directions in the texture's world). This is achieved with
   glTexParameter(...GL_TEXTURE_&lt;S or T&gt;_WRAP...).

<LI>"Texture Coordinates" specifies how the texture is mapped to the object.
   Because 0.0 is the default for the first parameter, one side of the
   texture is always mapped to the edge of the cube's face. This should be
   used in conjunction with Texture Wrap S and T for repeating the texture
   across the cube's faces. This is achieved with glTexCoord.
<P>
</UL>See the effects of these settings by experimenting with them in GLTex. When
loading large DIBs with high-resolution, be patient, there is a lot of
translation going on as described above, so depending on your system, this
may take some time.
