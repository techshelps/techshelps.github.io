The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.1, 3.5, and 3.51
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
Named pipes are implemented in Windows NT using the same approach used for
file systems. Within Windows NT, named pipes are represented as file
objects.
<P>
During the design phase, one idea for the implementation was to allow
<PRE>sub directories of named pipes. For example, a developer could create a
</PRE>named pipe sub directory called \MYPIPES. It would then be possible to
create and use pipes called \MYPIPES\PIPE1 and \MYPIPES\PIPE2, but it would
not be possible to use \MYPIPES as a pipe.
<P>
In the end, this idea was not implemented, so sub directories are not
supported. This does have some effect on the named-pipe names that are
allowed. If a pipe named \MYPIPES is created, it is not possible to
subsequently create a pipe named \MYPIPES\PIPE1, because \MYPIPES is
already a pipe name and cannot be used as a sub directory. It is possible
to
create a pipe named \MYPIPES\PIPE1, but only if there is no pipe named
\MYPIPES. The error received is ERROR_INVALID_NAME (123).
