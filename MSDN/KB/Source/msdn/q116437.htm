1. General MSDN Questions and Answers
 
<P>
How much does a membership in the Developer Network cost?
<P>
<PRE>   MSDN Level 1 membership costs $195 U.S. ($275 CAN) per year, MSDN Level
   2 membership is $495 U.S. ($555 CAN) per year. Developers who are
   currently members of MSDN Level 1 can upgrade to Level 2 membership for
   $395 U.S. ($555 CAN). International customers, please contact your local
   subsidiary.

</PRE></OL>If I upgrade to Developer Network Level 2 membership, do I get a rebate for
the Windows NT SDK/DDK CD that I recently purchased?
<P>
<PRE>   Realizing that most developers already have one or more of the
   individual components of the Development Platform, we chose not to have
   an upgrade price (no one would pay the suggested retail price). Instead
   of using marketing tactics, we chose to have one "real price" for all
   developers.

</PRE>How can I join the Developer Network?
<P>
<PRE>   In the U.S. and Canada, call (800) 759-5474, 24 hours a day, 7 days a
   week. In France, call 05 90 59 04 (Toll Free). In Germany, call
   0130 81 02 11 (Toll Free). In the Netherlands, call 06 022 24 80 (Toll
   Free). In the United Kingdom, call 0800 96 02 79 (Toll Free). For any
   other country in Europe, call +31 10 258 88 64. In Japan, call
   03-5461-2617. Everywhere else, call 402-691-0173.

</PRE>What is the difference between MSDN Level 1 and Level 2 membership?
<P>
<PRE>   MSDN Level 1 membership provides information that you need to develop
   for Windows and Windows NT via the searchable Development Library (CD)
   and the Developer Network News. Level 2 membership includes Level 1
   benefits plus all the operating systems and Windows, Windows for
   Workgroups, and Windows NT SDKs and DDKs on the Development Platform (CD
   set).

</PRE>How do I get setup support for the Development Library or Platform?
<P>
<PRE>   For Library setup support, call (425) 635-7033. For Platform setup
   support, call (800) 936-5800.

</PRE>How do I get product support for the contents of the Development Platform?
<P>
<PRE>   Development Platform support is available by calling (800) 936-5800.

</PRE>What licensing agreements are available for Level 1 and 2 memberships?
<P>
<PRE>   Level 1 membership includes a single-user license for the Development
   Library. Level 2 membership includes a single-user license that applies
   to both the Development Library and Platform.

   For the Development Library, additional user licenses to share a single
   CD over a network may be purchased for $40 ($55 CAN) each. Each
   additional user license allows one designated user to install the
   Development Library viewer software on a single workstation to access
   the CD contents. To order additional user licenses, call (800) 759-5474.

   For large workgroups, Level 1 memberships with concurrent-user licenses
   are available in two configurations: a five-user license is $595 ($835
   CAN) and a twenty-five-user license is $2495 ($3495 CAN). Concurrent-
   user licenses permit the members of a large group to install the
   Development Library viewer software on their workstations, but allow no
   more than five (or twenty-five) users to run the application at a given
   time. The number of developers supported by a concurrent-user license
   depends primarily on their usage patterns and network performance.
   Developers who expect to make heavy use of the Development Library
   should consider individual memberships.

</PRE>What about Level 2? Are additional user licenses available?
<P>
<PRE>   No. Level 2 membership includes a single-user license for both the
   Development Library and Development Platform. Because Microsoft
   operating systems can be licensed only to a single user, additional
   licenses are not available for Level 2 memberships.

</PRE>What is the Windows Development Toolkit (WDT)?
<P>
<PRE>   The Windows Development Toolkit is a retail product that provides the
   base level toolkits that developers need to write applications for
   Windows, WFW and Windows NT. It is essentially an entry level product
   for developers who want to "get their feet wet" with Windows
   programming. It is not designed to satisfy the demands of other Windows
   programmers. This is Microsoft's only retail software development kit
   for Windows. All other kits have been discontinued and are available via
   MSDN only. This product includes:

      * Win32 SDK v. 3.1 (no DDK)
      * Windows 3.1 SDK
      * OLE 2.01 (16 bit Windows only- not 32-bit or Mac)
      * Simple MAPI SDK (not MAPI 1.0)
      * A "Special Edition" of the Development Library containing docs and
        samples for the above SDKs, as well as a sampling of the Technical
        Articles, MSJ issues etc.

   Major differences between MSDN Level 2 and WDT

      * MSDN Level 2 is a membership program that delivers the latest in
        Microsoft operating systems, development kits and technical and
        strategic information . WDT is a retail product.
      * MSDN includes more than 20 different SDK's - WDT has 4
      * MSDN includes DDK's - WDT does not
      * MSDN includes nearly 40 different operating system versions - WDT
        does not
      * MSDN includes international versions of SDK's where available - WDT
        does not

</PRE>I'm not a MSDN member, but I'd like to check out the Developer Network News
free of charge. How can I do that?
<P>
<PRE>   Limited Developer Network News subscriptions are available. Send email
   with your mailing address to:

      CIS: &gt;INTERNET:msdn@microsoft.com
      Internet: msdn@microsoft.com

</PRE>I didn't get my disc this month, so how can I get it?
<P>
<PRE>   If you have a membership problem or question, call the Microsoft
   Developer Network Service Center at (800) 759-5474.

</PRE>How can I send in a suggestion for the next version of MSDN?
<P>
<PRE>   Please send in your MSDN suggestions to one of the following addresses:

      Internet:  msdn@microsoft.com

      Mail: Microsoft Developer Network
            One Microsoft Way
            Redmond, WA  98052-5399

            Attn: Developer Network

</PRE> 
2. Development Library Content Questions and Answers
 
<P>
When will the Office Development Kit (ODK) show up?
<P>
<PRE>   Most of the ODK (what was ready) was shipped in the April Library. We're
   working to prepare and test the rest of the ODK so it will show up in
   its entirety in the July Library.

</PRE> 
3. Development Platform Content Questions and Answers
 
<P>
Does the Development Library serve as the documentation for the Development
Platform?
<P>
<PRE>   Yes, the Development Library provides the documentation for the SDKs and
   DDKs distributed via the Development Platform, in addition to other
   information.

</PRE>Can I get printed copies of the documentation for the development kits
included on the Development Platform?
<P>
<PRE>   Yes. Printed copies of selected manuals can be ordered from Microsoft
   Press at (800) MS-PRESS for an additional cost. Documentation for the
   operating systems is not provided as part of the Developer Network.

</PRE>Why doesn't the Development Platform contain compilers?
<P>
<PRE>   The full SDKs (tools, headers, libs, docs, and so forth) are included on
   the Development Platform. Traditionally, SDKs do not contain compilers.
   The Development Platform is intended to be a development platform to
   which you add the compiler of your choice from the vendor of your
   choice.

   The only exception to this rule is when a compiler is not generally
   available, such as the Alpha and MIPS compilers in the Win32 SDK. These
   will remain in the SDK (and thus the Development Platform) until these
   compilers are generally available.

</PRE>Will Windows 95 be included in the Development Platform?
<P>
<PRE>   Windows 95 will be included once the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is
   removed. We do not include NDA software on the Development Library or
   Platform. There are public Windows 95-related technical articles and
   other information on the Development Library.

</PRE>Why isn't Pen Windows on the Development Platform?
<P>
<PRE>   Pen Windows is included in Windows 3.1. The only thing not included is
   the tablet driver that is specific to the pen tablet the customer is
   using (this comes from the tablet's manufacturer). The Pen SDK is
   included in the Windows 3.1 SDK, and pen driver samples are in the DDK.

</PRE>Does the Development Platform contain the MAPI SDK?
<P>
<PRE>   Yes, the Development Platform contains the Simple MAPI SDK and CMC SDK,
   which are the kits developers need to mail-enable their applications.
   However, we don't have a full MAPI SDK, which would allow developing a
   MAPI-compatible mail provider. This SDK is not ready for distribution
   in the July Platform.

</PRE>What is the difference between the Simple MAPI SDK and Extended MAPI SDK?
<P>
<PRE>   The Simple MAPI is a simple, quick API for mail-enabling applications so
   that apps can access the messaging features of Windows for Workgroups or
   Microsoft Mail 3.x. Extended MAPI is a more complex, object-oriented API
   for building messaging-reliant applications like mail clients, groupware
   applications, and so forth. The Extended MAPI is currently in beta and
   under NDA.

</PRE>Is the OLE 2.0 SDK 16-bit or 32-bit?
<P>
<PRE>   It's 16-bit. The 32-bit OLE is included in the Windows NT 3.5 (Daytona)
   SDK.

</PRE>Is the MAC Mail 3.1 MPW C SDK to be included on the Development Platform?
<P>
<PRE>   We are looking at this, but there are no current plans.

</PRE>Why isn't the LAN Manager PDK on the Development Platform?
<P>
<PRE>   To include this content would require extensive work (specifically, for
   the documentation). We do not have enough demand for this content to
   justify the effort. We will continue to sell the LM PDK separately as
   long as we have customer demand and as long as MS continues to sell LAN
   Manager.

</PRE>When will Win G information show up on the Development Platform?
<P>
<PRE>   We are planning on including the final version of WinG on the October
   Platform.

</PRE> 
4. Development Library Support Questions and Answers
 
<P>
My search ranges keep disappearing. Why?
<P>
<PRE>   There is a bug in the software. Ranges are stored in a file called
   VIEWER.INI which is located in your Windows directory. If you have lost
   your ranges, you can run Setup to have the default ranges restored.
   Create ranges you use often. Make a backup of VIEWER.INI. If your ranges
   should disappear again, simply restore the backup version of VIEWER.INI,
   or at least the search range section, [MSDNCDx. Ranges].

</PRE>Where can I find the Development Library's sample code?
<P>
<PRE>   The files referred to in the Knowledge Base are part of the
   Microsoft Software Library, which can be found on the Internet at
   ftp.microsoft.com in the /SOFTLIB/MSLFILES directory and on MSDL at
   (425) 936-MSDL. Download INDEX.ZIP for filenames and abstracts.

</PRE>Where is VxD Lite?
<P>
<PRE>   VxD Lite was removed from the Development Library due to licensing
   issues. MSDN Level 2 members can use the DDK instead.

</PRE>Why do I get a General Protection Fault after double clicking on the
Development Library icon?
<P>
<PRE>   This problem can occur if the Library is trying to refer to a topic that
   does not exist. Edit VIEWER.INI in the Windows directory using a text
   editor. In the [MSDNCDx.Last] section, set Source=0. Save the file and
   try the Library icon again.

</PRE>My CD-ROM reports "Unable to read drive d:". What's wrong?
<P>
<PRE>   The most common reason for this is debris and dust on the disc. Use a
   soft cloth or facial tissue and some water (mild detergent if
   necessary).

   Wipe the disc from the center to the edge. NEVER use solvents of any
   kind as they may have an adverse effect on the polycarbonate material
   that the CD is made of. The second most common reason is that the CD-ROM
   drive is in need of cleaning or repair. Some older CD-ROM drives are
   unable to read more than 540 MB on a CD.

   If you suspect a bad CD, call the Microsoft Developer Network order
   center at (800) 759-5474 and request a replacement disc.

</PRE>When I search I get a "An error has occurred: [1 | 5]". What's wrong?
<P>
<PRE>   The Library search engine uses the space pointed to by the MS-DOS TEMP
   environment variable (usually set in AUTOEXEC.BAT). Be sure that TEMP is
   not assigned to a RAM drive. Some searches require as much as 4 megs,
   sometimes more! Be sure you have enough space on your hard drive. If
   TEMP is assigned to a network drive, the Windows directory will be used
   by default.

   There is a bug in the search engine that doesn't release the system
   resources it uses. This only happens when you use a custom "Restricted"
   range. After 5 or so searches, all of your system resources will be used
   up. Closing the Viewer software will free up the resources again.

</PRE>Copy has a 32k-limit. How can I copy larger articles?
<P>
<PRE>   Use CTRL-INSERT instead of Edit.Copy. Alternatively, you can install the
   Generic/Text Only printer driver in Control Panel and Connect it to
   FILE:.

   When you print to this printer, you will be asked for a file name.

</PRE>Can I copy the Development Library contents to a large hard drive and
run from there?
<P>
<PRE>   Yes. See the CD insert for licensing information.

</PRE>Words like if and then are hyperlinked when they're used as normal words in
sentences. Why?
<P>
<PRE>   The hyperlinking process is automated. These 'false jumps' are a
   byproduct of the automated process.

</PRE>When I print a topic with a graphic that won't fit on a page, it is printed
twice. Why?
<P>
<PRE>   This is a known bug. There are no known workarounds. The problem has
   been addressed in the July Library.

</PRE>When printing a topic with a button to a Postscript printer I get a DIV
error. Why?
<P>
<PRE>   This is a known problem. Install the Olivetti HG 308 PS Postscript
   printer driver and try printing to your printer with that.

</PRE>I get a GPF in GDI.EXE at 0014:13FE when I print. Why?
<P>
<PRE>   This GPF occurs when you try to print a topic with a graphic to certain
   printers. If you are printing to a Hewlett-Packard printer, try using
   the HP4/4M printer driver instead of your usual driver. This problem has
   been addressed in the July Library.

</PRE>I see a bunch of Dr. GUI graphics. What's wrong with my system?
<P>
<PRE>   The "Dr. GUI" bitmap is an anchor for graphics that weren't prepped in
   time, or are not available in a format that can be converted to a
   viewable format for the Library. If there are important graphics
   missing, please send email to INTERNET:msdn@microsoft.com.

</PRE>I get a "String Parameter is missing an ending quotation mark." message.
<P>
<PRE>   This bug is caused by attempts to open multiple instances of the Library
   software which is not possible.

</PRE>How do I get the Development Library to print correctly? The graphics
usually print as a black box instead of the graphic, or I get an error
during printing.
<P>
<PRE>   Try copying the topic and pasting to word processing application. The
   Library software uses screen fonts and will not print correctly and can
   cause other errors with some printers and printer drivers. Pasting into
   a word processor will usually convert these fonts to printer or Windows
   TrueType fonts so that they can print correctly. This problem has been
   addressed in the July Library.

</PRE>I get a GPF or other error message during the Development Library set-up.
What can I do?
<P>
<PRE>   One suggestion is to manually install the Library. There is a text file
   on the Library with instructions on how to do this. Look for the file
   MANSETUP.TXT.

</PRE>I am on a network and can't install the Development Library. Why is
setup failing?
<P>
<PRE>   The Library uses Viewer 2.0 and will try to copy several files to the
   Windows \SYSTEM sub-directory. If you are running shared Windows from a
   network, setup may fail because it is unable to copy these files to the
   network drive. You must have write privileges to the drive where Windows
   is installed and running.

</PRE> 
5. Development Platform Support Questions and Answers
 
<P>
Development Platform .DOCs and .WRIs are unreadable. Is my disc corrupt?
<P>
<PRE>   The Development Platform contains all of the operating systems and SDKs,
   including international ones. Some versions (i.e. Japanese) use
   double-byte character sets. Files created for these systems can only be
   read on DBCS-enables systems). To find the equivalent files in English,
   look on the next disc in the same directory.

</PRE>The liner notes say that Service Pack (SP) 3 is on the Development Platform
but I can only find SP 2. Why?
<P>
<PRE>   The liner notes were incorrect. Service Pack 2 is the latest. It
   includes CSD003, which is the latest.

</PRE>Which Daytona forum should MSDN Level 2 members use to get support?
<P>
<PRE>   GO DAYTONADEV is the developer forum for Windows NT 3.5 prerelease
   developers.

</PRE>The WHAT6 tools on the Development Platform point me to a net
location. What's up?
<P>
<PRE>   The tools had a bad setup that failed to copy some files and installed
   icons in the Program Manager that referenced locations on the Microsoft
   corporate network. The correct tools are on the July Development
   Library.

</PRE>I'm having problems installing Video for Windows from the April Development
Platform. Why?
<P>
<PRE>   The problem was not that the SDK did not install; it was that there was
   no entry to install the Video for Windows run time in our installer
   utility.

   This has been fixed for the July Platform.

</PRE>Where are the .ERR files the Help compiler needs?
<P>
<PRE>   They were tough to find on the April Platform, but are available in the
   same directory as the Help compiler in the July Platform.

</PRE>Some of the Win32 SDK (disc five) is missing. How come?
<P>
<PRE>   We omitted some things on the Win32 SDK and Windows NT DDK disc (Disc 5)
   in April. For example, we left off the CD audio tracks that are part of
   the hardware compatibility tests. We will be fixing this for the July
   release of the Platform.

</PRE>What utility is needed to view the files in the \DOC directory of
Development Platform disc 8.
<P>
<PRE>   Japanese Windows or Windows NT.
