The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Development Library
<LI>Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Level I CD
</UL> 
<P>
The MSDN Development Library CD contains technical reference material to
help you develop Windows-based software. It includes technical articles,
sample source code, books, journal articles, Microsoft technical white
papers and specifications, as well as the Microsoft Knowledge Base and
documentation for SDKs, DDKs, and tools such as Visual C++ and Visual
Basic.
<P>
The Development Library differs from the Development Platform in that the
Development Platform contains software development kits (SDKs) and device
driver kits (DDKs) along with current versions of all Microsoft operating
systems. The information in this article applies only to the MSDN
Development Library.
<P>
Prior to April, the Development Library CD 6 contained a technical article
called "VxD-Lite Mini-DDK" in the Technical Articles/Windows
Articles/Kernel and Driver Articles section. This article was a subset of
the full Microsoft Windows version 3.1 Device Driver Kit (DDK) and provided
documentation, tools, and samples for building application-oriented VxDs.
<P>
The "VxD-Lite Mini-DDK" article and all its accompanying tools were removed
starting with the April release of the MSDN Development Library (CD 7). Due
to the nature of its content, Microsoft decided that this article really
belonged on the Development Platform CD.
<P>
The article and all the related tools is now available on the Development
Platform CD in the Windows 3.1 Device Driver's Kit (DDK). In place of the
article, the April (CD 7) Development Library contains the following note:
<P>
<PRE>   "The VxD-Lite Mini-DDK" has been removed from the Microsoft
   Development Library. That information is now available on the
   Development Platform CD in the Windows 3.1 Device Driver's Kit."

</PRE>All Microsoft Knowledge Base articles that still refer to the "The VxD-Lite
Mini-DDK" article as being on the Development Library CD are incorrect and
will be updated as soon as possible.
