<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article details how AS/400 commands are constructed, gives examples of
how they are used, and references sources of help on the AS/400.
<P>
Information for this article was taken mainly from AS/400 system
documentation. Sections preceded by &amp;&amp;&amp; are copies of displays. This
article is most useful if viewed using a fixed-width font.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
AS/400 Command Formats:
<P>
AS400 commands are generally constructed using syntactical blocks. These
blocks are concatenated together to produce commands. Generally, the first
block on a command details the action to be taken by the command, and all
subsequent parts of the command are modifiers. For example, the command
WRKSYSVAL is composed of three major blocks, one action, and two specifiers
of the action's object:
<P>
<PRE>   WRK stands for WoRK, SYS stands for SYStem
   VAL stands for VALues

   WRKSYSSTS is composed of three blocks:

      WRK for WoRK
      SYS for SYStem
      STS for STatuS

</PRE>The blocks are relatively consistent from command to command. Generally,
the same action block will be used with a variety of objects that can be
affected by its purpose. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   WRKSYSVAL    (WoRK with SYStem VALues)
   WRKSPLF      (WoRK SPooLed Files)
   WRKOBJ      (WoRK with OBJects)
   WRKCFGSTS   (WoRK ConFiGuration STatuS)

</PRE>The object part is also relatively consistent between actions. A single
object block may be used with different actions. Example:
<P>
<PRE>   CRTDEVD      (CReaTe DEVice Description)
   DLTDEVD      (DeLeTe DEVice Description)
   WRKDEVD      (WoRK DEVice Description)

</PRE>Apart from the CL (Command Language) Reference Guides, the better sources
of OS/400 command documentation are contained within OS/400 itself. It
should be noted that the OS/400 Help Facility is an optional component, and
some AS/400's may not have it installed.
<P>
&lt;F4&gt; in any command line for a user with sufficient privileges brings up
the major command groups. The major command groups is a menu based help
facility that catalogues commands in intuitive groups based on object
function.
<P>
The SLTCMD command (SeLecT CoMmanD) allows the user to create a list of
commands that adhere to a specific pattern or group. For example:
<P>
&amp;&amp;&amp;{
<PRE> MAIN                           AS/400 Main Menu
                                                            System: RAINIER
 Select one of the following:

      1. User tasks
      2. Office tasks

      4. Files, libraries, and folders

      6. Communications

      8. Problem handling
      9. Display a menu
     10. Information Assistant options
     11. PC Support tasks

     90. Sign off

 Selection or command
 ===&gt; SLTCMD CMD(WRKD*)

 F3=Exit   F4=Prompt   F9=Retrieve   F12=Cancel   F13=Information Assistant
 F23=Set initial menu

</PRE>}&amp;&amp;&amp;
<P>

 Parameters or command
 ===&gt;
 F3=Exit      F4=Prompt   F5=Refresh   F9=Retrieve   F11=Display names only
 F12=Cancel   F16=Repeat position to   F17=Position to

</PRE>}&amp;&amp;&amp;
<P>
The user can then select the desired command from the list. Note that
the wildcard will only work at the end of a string.
<P>
If the user types in a command on a command line, and the presses the
F4 key, all default parameters for that particular command will be
shown, some with default values. AS/400 has field level help. If the
user has any questions on the definition or use of a particular
parameter, the user should position the cursor over the desired field
or item, and press F1. A window with the AS/400 help facility will be
displayed.
<P>
NOTE: The AS/400 help facility is not a required item to install.
Although many users install it as part of their operating system,
some users do not in order to save DASD (disk array) space. Note also
that the help facility is sensitive to security requirements. If the
user does not have enough privileges to use a command, he will not
have privileges to use help against it either.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>COMMANDS</h2>
 
<P>
WORKING WITH LINES
<P>
The following are some objects blocks used for referring to lines:
<P>
<PRE>   DLT (DeLeTe), DSP (DiSPlay), WRK (WoRK):

      - LIND       (LINe Description)

   CHG (CHanGe), CRT (CReaTe):

      - LINETH    (LINe ETHernet)
      - LINSDLC   (LINe SDLC)
      - LINTDLC   (LINe TDLC [Twinax])
      - LINTRN   (LINe Token RiNg)
      - LINX25   (LINe X.25)

</PRE>Generally the simplest way to verify the configuration for a line is by
using:
<P>
<PRE>   WRKLIND {line description name}

</PRE>To get a listing of all the lines on an AS/400:
<P>
<PRE>   WRKLIND *ALL

</PRE>This command displays a list of all the lines that are configured in the
system, and that the current user has sufficient privileges to view. The
user interface in the Work with Line Descriptions facility allows the user
to scroll through the list using the PageUp/PageDown keys, and has a single
character field in front of each line name to allow the management of each
line under the Opt heading:
<P>
&amp;&amp;&amp;{
<PRE>                          Work with Line Descriptions
                                                            System:RAINIER
 Position to  . . . . .                Starting characters

 Type options, press Enter.
   2=Change   3=Copy    4=Delete   5=Display   6=Print   7=Rename
   8=Work with status   9=Retrieve source

 Opt   Line         Type     Text
  _    ANDERSEN     *SDLC    sdlc dial-out for AC; Pass thru source.
  _    CHICAGO      *SDLC    'sdlc dial-in  for AC;
  _    ETHLINE      *ELAN    ETHERNET LINE
  _    ETHLINE2     *ELAN    ETHERNET LINE
  _    HNETHOST     *SDLC    Help/NET Product Support
  _    LANLINE      *TRLAN   TOKEN RING LINE
  _    L02124BSC    *BSC     EDI/400 BSC manual dial line at 02400 baud.
  _    MPGLIN       *SDLC    MPG - Midrange Performance Group line LIN011
  _    QESLINE      *SDLC    IBM DIAL OUT LINE - LIN021

  More...
 Parameters or command
 ===&gt;
 F3=Exit   F4=Prompt   F5=Refresh   F6=Create   F9=Retrieve   F12=Cancel
 F14=Work with status
</PRE>}&amp;&amp;&amp;
<P>
The user interface for this command allows the user to do all the functions
that any of the other commands allow. The codes on the top of the screen
are the allowed codes for the option field. To display the parameters for
line description ETHLINE2, type a 5 in the Opt field to its left.
<P>
<P>
WORKING WITH CONTROLLERS AND DEVICES
<P>
Apart from the fact that the actual configuration parameters are distinct
because the objects being dealt with are different, the device and
controller commands are very similar to the line commands. The more
important commands for working with devices and controllers are built with
these blocks:
<P>
<PRE>   DLT (DeLeTe), DSP (DiSPlay), WRK (WoRK):

      - DEVD       (DEVice Description)
      - CTLD         (ConTroLler Description)

   CHG (CHanGe), CRT (CReaTe):

      - DEVAPPC      (DEVice APPC)
      - CTLAPPC      (ConTroLer APPC)

</PRE>The user interface is very similar to the user interface for WRKLIND.
<P>
<P>
WORKING WITH HARDWARE RESOURCES
<P>
Line descriptions are configuration parameters for a type of connection
over a specific hardware resource (hence the resource name parameter in the
line description). The following command displays, and offer a user
interface for handling communication hardware components of an AS/400:
<P>
<PRE>   WRKHDWRSC *CMN
   [WoRK with HarDWare ReSourCes - *CoMmuNications]

</PRE>If the line being troubleshot is a Twinax line, use the following command
to look at Local WorkStations:
<P>
<PRE>   WRKHDWRSC *LWS
   [WoRK with HarDWare ReSourCes - *Local WorkStations]

</PRE>The interface is similar to the interface offered by WRKLIND. This command
may be necessary to use if unable to configure correctly a line on the
AS/400.
<P>
<P>
WORKING WITH CONFIGURATION STATUS
<P>
Line descriptions are not useful until they have been activated for use.
This activation process is known as Vary On. The opposite of this function
takes a line off-line, Vary Off. The importance of having the lines varied
on when attempting to communicate with and AS/400 cannot be over-stressed.
A varied off line is not accessible, even if it is configured correctly.
<P>
The more useful commands when either querying the status of a line,
controller, or device, or attempting to vary it on or off are the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   VRYCFG CFGOBJ({description}) CFGTYPE(*LIN|*DEV|*CTL)  STATUS(*ON|*OFF)
   [VaRY ConFiGuration]

   WRKCFGSTS CFGTYPE(*LIN) CFGD({description[optional]})
   [WoRK with ConFiGuration STatuS]

</PRE>VRYCFG simply changes the status of the line and has no user interface,
while WRKCFGSTS will provide a user interface through which the user can
monitor the status and make changes as appropriate.
<P>
<P>
DISPLAYING AND CHANGING NETWORK ATTRIBUTES
<P>
Network attributes on the AS/400 are the equivalent of the Server
Properties on the SNA Server Admin. It displays general networking
information on the AS/400 such as: Network Name, Local (to the AS/400)
Control Point Name, APPN node type. Access the network attributes using the
following commands:
<P>
<PRE>   DSPNETA
   [DiSPlay NETwork Attributes]

   CHGNETA
   [CHanGe NETwork Attributes]


</PRE>OTHER AS/400 COMMANDS
<P>
These commands may prove to be useful in some situations:
<P>
<PRE>   DSPMSG &lt;message queue&gt;
   [DiSPlay MeSsaGe]
   View messages sent to a particular queue. If no message queue is
   specified, the command brings up the current user's message queue. The
   message queue used by default for system generated error, warning,
   and informational messages, is the queue for QSYSOPR:

      DSPMSG QSYSOPR

   allows the user to view any messages for any event requiring attention.
   Messages needing a reply can be identified by a blank line under the
   message. Set the cursor over a message using the arrow keys, and press
   the F1 key to get more information about that message. The help
   information displayed may include suggested troubleshooting steps.

   WRKSPLF
   [WoRK with SPooLed Files]
   View, change properties, and delete spooled files in queue for a print
   device (or to be sent to a print device). Generally, when a device fails
   while in session, an entry is created with details of all the errors
   that occurred while that device was in session. Useful for
   troubleshooting specific station problems.

   WRKACTJOB
   [WoRK with ACTive JOBs]
   Displays and allows system operators to manage jobs that are currently
   active in the system. Displays useful information such as the job's
   creator, time and date of creation, job attributes and parameters, CPU
   load, CPU share of a job.

   WRKSYSVAL *ALL
   [WoRK with SYStem VALues - *ALL]
   Displays a full list of all system values in the AS/400. Includes items
   such as QAUTOCFG (switch for auto-configuration) and QAUTOVRT (virtual
   devices to create).

   WRKMODD
   [WoRK with MODe Description]
   Provides user interface for managing all modes defined in the system.
   The user interface is similar to the user interface used for changing
   line and device descriptions.

   WRKFLR
   [WoRK with FoLdeRs]
   Provides user interface for displaying and managing all shared folders
   created in the system.

   WRKSBSD
   [WoRK with SuBSystem Description]
   Provides user interface for management of the properties of all or some
   subsystems on the AS/400. Subsystems are processes that are responsible
   for managing resources for a particular group of jobs, such as 5250
   display or printer sessions. This command is usually used for
   troubleshooting whether a particular subsystem can support a particular
   device type.

</PRE>NOTE: Security commands are not included in this document. Refer to OS/400
system documentation for more details.
