The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11
   Service Pack 1, and 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Network Client version 3.0 for MS-DOS
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to use the SNA Server Clients in MS-DOS and Windows 3.x with
Network Client 3.0 for MS-DOS. However, there are some limitations that
affects the SNA Server Client installation and configuration.
<P>
NOTE: The Network Client 3.0 files are located in the \Clients\MSClient
directory on the Windows NT Server compact disc.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following limitations exist when you use the SNA Server Client in MS-
DOS and Windows 3.x with Network Client 3.0:

<UL><LI>The SNA Server Client does not work if you install the IPX/SPX
   Compatible Transport (NWLink) protocol in Network Client 3.0.

<LI>When you install the SNA Server Windows 3.x Client on a Network Client
   3.0 network operating system, the following error message appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      No Windows network Installed
</PRE><P>
   The SNA Server Client Setup looks for the LANMAN.INI and the NETAPI.DLL
   files when you use a DOS LAN Manager client. However, these two files do
   not exist for Network Client 3.0. To work around this problem, you must
   copy the NETAPI.DLL file from a DOS LAN Manager client installation to
   the Network Client 3.0 directory (usually C:\NET). For additional
   information on how the SNA Server Client determines the network
   operating system, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../SNA/Q128118.htm">Q128118</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : SNA Server Win3.x Client Setup Err Msg: No Windows
                  network...

</PRE><LI>The SNA Server Client communicates with the SNA Server using named
   pipes if you select Microsoft Networking as the Client/Server Protocol
   during Setup. However, Network Client 3.0 does not support asynchronous
   named pipes when the Client is running under Enhanced Mode Windows.
   Therefore, you must run Windows in standard mode if you want to
   communicate with the SNA Server. If you run Windows in enhanced mode and
   start the SNA Server Client, the following error message appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SNA Server Error: 546
      Cannot establish connection with SNA Server.
</PRE>
<LI>Network Client 3.0 supports the TCP/IP protocol. Both Network Client and
   SNA Server Client are Winsock compliant. To enable Sockets in Network
   Client 3.0, please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q128751.htm">Q128751</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : No "Advanced" button in Client TCP/IP Configuration Box

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../CROSSNET/Q142062.htm">Q142062</A></B>
      TITLE     : Unable to Run Win16 Sockets Application under Windows 3.1

   After you enable Sockets, you can configure the SNA Server Client to use
   TCP/IP as the Client/Server Protocol. This allows you to communicate
   with the SNA Server using TCP/IP Sockets instead of name pipes. As a
   result, you can run Windows in enhanced mode. You must configure the SNA
   Server Client as Remote even though you are logging on to the same
   domain as the SNA Server. The IP addresses of the SNA Server is required
   in the Primary and Backup Server fields. If you enter the name of the
   SNA Server in these fields, SNA Server Error 546 appears. If you
   configure the Client as Local, SNA Server Errors 546 and 629 appear.

</PRE></UL>As an alternative, you can use the DOS LAN Manager client. The limitations
listed above do not apply to the DOS LAN Manager client. The Setup files
for the DOS LAN Manager client is located in the \Clients\Lanman
directory on the Windows NT Server compact disc.
