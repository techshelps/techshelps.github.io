The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
After you install Windows NT SNA Server, several default shares are created
with permissions set to EVERYONE FULL CONTROL. Changing permissions on
these directories to something else can cause the SNA product to not
function correctly. One symptom of this is that the system slows down when
you start Windows NT after you have modified permissions on the COMCFG
share or file privileges on the COM.CFG file.
<P>
SNA Server services (SnaBase, SnaServer, Link services) run under the local
system context and access the CONFIG file through UNC names
(\\SERVER\COMCFG\COM.CFG). If the EVERYONE users doesn't have full control
access, this causes the services to go into a loop trying to open COM.CFG.
<P>
SNA Patch #8 (SNA20.P08 - update to SNADMOD.DLL) is modified to display a
dialog box that says COM.CFG cannot be opened, thus allowing the Windows NT
server to perform as usual. Later updates to the SNA Server 2.0 SNADMOD.DLL
will also include this fix.
<P>
SNA Server 2.0 patches are located on:
<PRE>   - Microsoft's Internet Server (FTP.MICROSOFT.COM)
     - BUSSYS\SNASRVR\SUP-ED\FIXES (supported)
     - BUSSYS\SNASRVR\UNSUP-ED\FIXES (unsupported)

</PRE>Also, various hotfixed versions of Windows NT version 3.1 include an
updated SRV.SYS which will lead to similar problems mentioned above. The
original release of Windows NT version 3.1, and all official Service Pack
#1 and #2 updates work fine.
<P>
However, the following version of &lt;winnt&gt;\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\SRV.SYS should
be avoided:
<P>
<PRE>   U.S. Service Pack 2a version (shipped on the August and September 1994
   TechNet CD-ROM), which has a size of 193748.

</PRE>This problem is corrected by applying the regular U.S. Service Pack 2 or
U.S. Service Pack 3, which has a size of 193732.
