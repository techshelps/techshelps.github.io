The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 3.0
- Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 3.0, Service Pack 1
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
TN3270 Client disconnects from the TN3270 Server when a client receives a
message. The message received by the client was sent by a host application
from another user.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The TN3270E Server received an RQD message from the host that contained the
EC (End Chain) indicator. The TN3270 server sent the data to the client,
and changed its internal state to let the client have send-direction. The
TN3270 server then receives data from the client before receiving a
positive response from the client for the previous message. When the TN3270
server tries to send this data from the client across the RUI interface, it
is rejected with the error LUA_RSP_BEFORE_SENDING_REQ.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The fix is to discard data received from the client if the client owes the
server a positive response. The TN3270 Server service has been updated to
correct this problem.
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. The updated
file is:
<P>
<PRE>   Tn3servr.exe

</PRE>A further problem in this area has been corrected in an update since
SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 1 was released. A fix for this further problem
is available from Microsoft.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>

This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
