<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.11 Service Pack 1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a client that supports TN3270/E, the client connection may
drop abnormally.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The TN3270/E Service may improperly handle acknowledgments between SNA
Server and a TN3270E client, causing the SNA Server to report an invalid
sequence number error to the TN3270/E Service. This error results in a
dropped TN3270E client session.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Made a change to the TN3270E Server Service to not treat the RUI_WRITE as
an implicit acknowledgment.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server
version 2.11 Service Pack 1.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Way TN3270 (Not TN3270E) Clients Get Acknowledged by the TN3270/E
Server Service
 
<P>
RUI applications, such as the TN3270/E Server service, are required to send
courtesy acknowledgments for RQE data, so that the node can clear out its
internal correlation table.
<P>
When the TN3270 Server is connected to a TN3270 client, the SNA Server
Service issues a courtesy acknowledgment for each RU of data it receives
from the SNA host just as soon as it has passed the data on to the TN3270
client.
<P>
<P><h3>The Way TN3270/E Clients Get Acknowledged by the TN3270/E Server Service</h3>
 
<P>
When the TN3270 Server is connected to a TN3270/E client, acknowledgments
are done differently. In TN3270E (unlike TN3270), data is passed to the
TN3270E client with a flag specifying whether the data is RQD or RQE. The
TN3270E terms for these are ALWAYS-RESPONSE and ERROR-RESPONSE. In order
to match up responses from the TN3270E client, there is also a sequence
number on each data message between the server and the client. This
sequence number does not match the SNA sequence number in the SNF
field (as defined by the IBM SNA Formats Guide).
<P>
Therefore, the effect of this is that the TN3270E Server cannot immediately
send a courtesy acknowledgment for each RU of data it receives from the
node, because the TN3270E client might, at some later time, send a negative
response to the data, and the server is supposed to pass this negative
response on to the SNA host. Therefore, the TN3270E Server has to keep its
own correlation table---mapping TN3270E sequence numbers to SNA sequence
numbers, just in case a TN3270E client decides to send a negative response
to an ERROR-RESPONSE message. This correlation table has a fixed number of
entries, and whenever this table begins to fill up the TN3270 Server clears
out some of it (but only the oldest messages), and sends a courtesy
acknowledgment at that point for the messages it is removing from the
table.
<P>
The following diagram illustrates the message flow of the problem:

                            Implicit ACK (SNF=001E).   -&gt;
                            See Note 2.
                                                          &lt;- Error (Invalid
                                                          Sequence Number)

                            &lt;- Error (Invalid Sequence Number)

</PRE>Notes:

<UL><LI>This is an RUI_WRITE and is treated as a courtesy ack for the
   RUI_READ that was received earlier. You can find out which data is
   being acknowledged by looking at the snf field, and matching it up with
   the snf field for the previous RUI_READ (001E).

<LI>The TN3270E Server's algorithm does not take a crucial fact into
   account. This fact is that the node treats inbound data (that is, data
   from an TN3270E emulator) as an implicit courtesy acknowledgment for any
   outbound data it has previously passed to the emulator. In this case,
   there has been an exchange of outbound and inbound data (from the
   TN3270E emulator), and by the time that the TN3270E Server issues a
   courtesy acknowledgment to the SNA Server Service then the message for
   which it is sending the acknowledgment has already been implicitly
   acknowledged by some inbound data (RUI_WRITE).  This causes the error
   which causes the session to end.
