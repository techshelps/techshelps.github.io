<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11,and
   3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start the SNA Server service, you may get the following Error 242
message:
<P>
<PRE>   DLC 802.2 Link Service is configured to use NDIS adapter that is not
   installed.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The error is reporting that a link service that is configured to use a DLC
802.2 Link Service could not find an adapter bound to the driver specified
for the Link Service. This message indicates one of the following:

<UL><LI>A connection or media problem inserting into the Token Ring network.

<LI>A configuration problem with the network adapter.

<LI>A hardware problem with the adapter.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Error 242 will generally appear when the DLC cannot bind to the adapter
specified in the SNA Server DLC 802.2 Link Service Setup dialog. The main
reasons for this failure arises out of adapter initialization problems. The
following items should be checked to ensure that the network adapter is
initializing properly:

<UL><LI>The adapter can communicate to any other computer in the network.
<P>
   The ability to contact another computer on the network clears suspicion
   from any installation problems with the adapter. If another protocol is
   proven to work on the card, the DLC should find no hardware
   problems in the card. If only the DLC is being bound to the adapter (for
   SNA Server use only), then the Microsoft Windows NT Workstation service
   and transport (NetBEUI, TCP/IP, etc.) would need to be enabled over
   this adapter. Use the Bindings dialog box in the Windows NT Network
   Control Panel to verify that the bindings are enabled in order to test
   network connectivity. Otherwise, install a LAN protocol and enable
   its bindings to the network card.
<P>
   If this works properly, the adapter should not be suspect. Check the
   System Event Log to verify other reasons why the card appears not to be
   correctly binding. If the computer is multihomed, make sure that the
   connection to the host can be made using the affected adapter by
   disconnecting the other adapter from the network. If a Token Ring
   connection problem exists (due to a bad cable, bad port on the MAU
   or hub, mismatched Token Ring link speed, etc.), NetBEUI will report an
   error in the Windows NT system event log indicating a problem with the
   adapter.

<LI>A duplicate Token Ring adapter address exists in the Token Ring network.
<P>
   Therefore, the adapter cannot be inserted into the ring. Some Token Ring
   adapter drivers will report specific errors referring to problems
   inserting into the ring; unfortunately, some will not. The event log
   number will vary on an adapter to adapter basis. For example, an Olicom
   Token Ring card will return the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Event ID:5
      Could not open adapter OcTk1601. Duplicate node address.
      Source: "OcTk16" | "OcTk32" (depending on the adapter installed)
</PRE><P>
   For additional information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q122933.htm">Q122933</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Event Viewer Messages for the Olicom Network Card

   Some adapters will return protocol related events that will reference
   the adapter. IBM's 16/4 Token Ring Adapter, for example, returns a
   message related to protocol failure.

   For additional information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q121070.htm">Q121070</A></B>
      TITLE     : Duplicate Locally Administered Address Can Cause
                  Event 9006

   The adapter's factory set address could be overridden by using a locally
   administered address. Different adapters will have different ways of
   providing a locally administered address. Some cards will use Registry
   parameters, while some cards will have an option in the driver
   configuration to provide a locally administered address. Reference your
   particular adapter's documentation for details.

</PRE><LI>The driver may have failed to initialize for the adapter because of
   configuration problems.
<P>
   Problems with mismatched drivers or adapters that are not configured
   correctly will prevent the adapter from initializing correctly. Most
   instances involve a driver.
<P>
   Three particular situations have been isolated by Microsoft. However,
   there may be other reasons; this is just a partial list.
<P>
   If you see messages regarding driver initialization problems not
   discussed, check your adapter's documentation or the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base for the most recent information on <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/kb">http://www.microsoft.com/kb.</A></B>
<P>
   a. An initialization problem occurs with the 3Com 3c59x.sys because the
<P><PRE>      driver does not reset the adapter on Windows NT shutdown. When
      Windows NT restarts, the driver is not able to locate the NIC. A
      Service Control Manager event will warn that it was unable to start
      the adapter.

         TITLE     : 3C0M 3C59X.SYS Driver Fails to Initialize in
                     Windows NT 3.51

   b. The Oemsetup.inf file for the IBM Auto 16/4 Token Ring adapter driver
      (Ibmtok4.sys) does not add a required value in the Windows NT
      registry properly, causing Service Control Manager to report event
      7000s in the event log.

      Microsoft Knowledge Base:

         TITLE     : IBM 16/4 Auto Token Ring Adapter Driver Causes Event
                     ID 7000

</PRE><LI>A problem occurs when the Madge Smart 16/4 AT Plus Ringnode Token Ring
   adapter is configured for Normal software operating mode. This token
   ring adapter has two software operating modes: Normal mode and AT mode.
   By default, the adapter is set to Normal mode, and if the adapter is
   used in Normal mode, you can only use the drivers shipped with the Madge
   Token Ring adapter. If the adapter is used in AT mode, you can use
   previous versions of the drivers, and the Madge configuration software
   cannot override the I/O base address, Ring Speed, and SmartROM switch
   settings. The Service Control Manager will return errors related to not
   being able to stop the network adapter.
