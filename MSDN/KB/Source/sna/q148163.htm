<P>
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.11 SP1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If an LUA SLI application issues an SLI_RECEIVE request and passes a data
buffer that is smaller than the size of the chain being received, the SLI
interface returns a primary_rc of LUA_UNSUCCESSFUL and secondary_rc =
LUA_DATA_TRUNCATED. The SLI library returns as much data as possible to
the application's data buffer, but the remaining data in the chain is lost
and cannot be extracted on subsequent SLI_RECEIVE requests.
<P>
This forces the SLI application to allocate an SLI_RECEIVE data buffer
large enough to handle the full chain size.
<P>
Microsoft has enhanced the SNA Server 2.11 32-bit Windows LUA SLI interface
so an application does not have to preallocate the full buffer size when
receiving data using the SLI_RECEIVE API.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This new feature is enabled with an update of the WINSLI32.DLL and the
SNATRC.DLL, but has not been regression-tested. To enable this new feature,
the Windows application must set the resv56[3] byte to 0x01 on the SLI_OPEN
call. With this byte set, if the application issues SLI_RECEIVE and
specifies a data buffer which is smaller than the chain of data to be
received, SLI_RECEIVE returns with a primary_rc of LUA_OK and a
secondary_rc of LUA_DATA_INCOMPLETE (0x00000060). The next SLI_RECEIVE
returns the rest of the data for that chain, or as much as there is space
in the receive buffer.
<P>
If the SLI_OPEN does not have the resv56[3] byte set to 0x01, then the
SLI_RECEIVE is supported normally. In this case if an SLI_RECEIVE is issued
with a buffer smaller than the chain of data received from the host then
the SLI_RECEIVE returns with primary_rc = LUA_UNSUCCESFUL, and the
secondary_rc  = LUA_DATA_TRUNCATED (0x00000003). The remainder of data for
that chain is discarded by the SLI library.
