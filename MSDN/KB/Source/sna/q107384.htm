The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If an SLI_OPEN follows immediately after an SLI_CLOSE statement the SSCP
Welcome message screen may appear twice under some certain timing
conditions.
<P>
An SNA Server 2.11 update is available which closes a timing window where
this can occur. For additional information, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../SNA/Q137482.htm">Q137482</A></B>
   Title     : LUA Program Receives Host Sign-On Screen Twice and then
               Hangs

</PRE>However, with this update applied, this problem can still occur under
certain timing conditions described in this article.
<P>
<P><h3>An Additional Update Is Available</h3>
 
<P>
Another update to SNA Server 2.11 now supports the ability to put a small
configurable delay between the SLI_CLOSE completion and issuing the new
SLI_OPEN statement. Microsoft has updated the following file to include
this feature:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;snaroot&gt;\system\WINRUI32.DLL

</PRE>This update is for Win32 clients only and is implemented in the WIN32 RUI
Interface and exported as a new registry value.
<P>
<P><h3>Implementing the Update</h3>
 
<P>
To set this delay you have to obtain the update and add the new registry
value INITDELAY under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree under the following
subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaBase\Parameters\Client

</PRE>Use the following information when adding the new value:
<P>
<PRE>   Value Name: INITDELAY
   Data Type:  REG_DWORD
   Data:       0-10 (decimal)

   Default:    0 seconds

</PRE>This variable sets an optional delay in seconds in processing RUI_INIT
requests. If you do not specify an entry for data, there is no delay. If
you configure a value greater than 10, then a value of 10 is used.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When an LUA session is closed and immediately reopened, the SNA Server
may resend the host SSCP welcome message twice to the LUA application.
The following diagram explains what is happening:
<P>
<PRE>Message flow as the node sees it.       Message flow as the host sees it.
    Host                Node                Host             Node
    ====                ====                ====             ====

      NOTIFY unavailable                      NOTIFY unavailable
        (SLU disabled)                         (SLU disabled)
     &lt;--------------------                   &lt;----------------

          NOTIFY +rsp                           NOTIFY +rsp
     --------------------&gt;                   -----------------&gt;

        NOTIFY available                        logon banner
     &lt;--------------------                   -----------------&gt;

        logon banner                           NOTIFY available
                                                (SLU enabled)
     --------------------&gt;                   &lt;-----------------

        NOTIFY +rsp                             NOTIFY +rsp
     --------------------&gt;                   -----------------&gt;

        logon banner                            logon banner
     --------------------&gt;                   -----------------&gt;

</PRE>When the host receives the first NOTIFY it sends a logon screen. At the
same time, the node is sending the second NOTIFY. In this case by the time
that the logon screen reaches the node, the node has passed on the second
NOTIFY to the link service. In that situation the node is not able to
determine whether the logon screen was sent due to the first NOTIFY, or the
second NOTIFY, and so it passes it up to the application. Shortly
thereafter, the second logon screen arrives, and the node also passes that
up to the application.
<P>
This is because the underlying SSCP-LU session on which the NOTIFYs and the
logon screens flow is not brought down when the SLI session is brought down
and a new SLI session is started. Therefore, the node cannot tell that a
particular message on the SSCP-LU session is associated with the SLI
session which has been terminated.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This feature is included in the latest U.S. Service Pack for SNA Server for
Windows NT, version 2.11. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
