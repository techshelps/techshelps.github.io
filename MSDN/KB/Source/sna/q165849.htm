The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
SNA Server Manager performance is slow when there are a large number of
3270 LUs configured. Also, if the connection or active users window is not
being viewed, the client session counts may be incorrect.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
SNA Server Manager was recounting active sessions when a 3270 LU was opened
or closed. Also, if 3270 LUs aren't viewed in Manager, status information
wasn't being received for these LUs, causing client session counting to be
incorrect.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem. To
resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.
<P>
The session counting is now done on the server in a thread which activates
every 15 seconds. It sends updated counts to Manager if counts have
changed. This means that session count updates in Manager may be delayed by
as much as 15 seconds.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
