<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how the SNA Server client server interface locates
an available LU for both APPC and EIS/3270 applications, both with and
without Service Pack 1 installed.
<P>
Microsoft has updated the following files. Service Pack 1 is planned to be
released in December 1995. To obtain these files before Service Pack 1 is
released, contact Microsoft Product Support Services. Service Pack 1
includes the following modified files:
<P>
<PRE>   Operating System     Modified Files
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   Windows NT           SNABASE.EXE, SNACFG.DLL, SNADMOD.DLL, WAPPC32.DLL
   Windows 95           SNADMOD.DLL, WAPPC32.DLL
   Windows 3.x          WDMOD.DLL, WINAPPC.DLL

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>EIS/3270, Without Service Pack 1 Installed</h3>
 
<P>
Over the sponsor connection, the EIS/3270 application makes a sepdcrec()
call to acquire a list of the LUs/pools that are assigned to the client's
user record. On a connect request to open a session, the application issues
an OPEN SSCP request on the chosen LU/Pool name. The underlying DMOD (part
of the client server interface) attempts to locate the server that can
house this available LU by connecting to each server in the client's local
service table one by one until the specified LU/Pool is satisfied. It must
do this because the local service table does not contain any LU/Pool
information; it contains only server names.
<P>
<P><h3>APPC, Without Service Pack 1 Installed</h3>
 
<P>
During the TP_START request and ALLOCATE verb processing that a TP does to
get a conversation, the underlying DMOD (part of the client server
interface) attempts to locate the server that houses this available LU by
connecting to each server in the client's local service table one by one
until the specified LU-LU pair is satisfied. It must do this because the
local service table does not contain any APPC LU information; it contains
only server names.
<P>
<P><h3>EIS/3270, With Service Pack 1 Installed</h3>
 
<P>
The client still makes the normal sepdcrec() call to acquire a list of the
LUs/pools that are assigned to the client's user record. As part of the
OPEN SSCP message processing, the SNA Server client software sends a new
RPC request (RPC_LU_SERVER_LIST) to the SNA Server that is supporting the
client computer's sponsor connection. The requested LU name from the OPEN
SSCP is part of the RPC request. The sponsor server returns a list of the
servers who can possibly support the requested LU. If the LU is a dedicated
LU, the list has only one server name. If it is a POOL the list may have up
to 50 server names. After this RPC response, the resource locating
continues normally except that the client tries (in random order) only the
servers whose names are in the LUs server list. In general, the client
tries only the servers that can actually support the LU resource.
<P>
<P><h3>APPC, With Service Pack 1 Installed</h3>
 
<P>
The RPC request is sent as part of the TP_START request and ALLOCATE verb
processing. In both cases, the server returns the list of servers where the
local or remote LU Alias is configured. The rest is similar to 3270
resource location.
<P>
In both the EIS/3270 and the APPC, the RPC request is sent only once per
LU. The SNA Server client interface cashes the LU/Server information
internally. In Windows NT and Windows 95, the cache is flushed when the
application exits. In Windows 3.x, the cache is flushed when the client
server piece (Wnap.exe) terminates.
<P>
NOTE: If the sponsor server is not running SNA Server 2.11 with Service
Pack 1 installed, the client DMOD sends only one RPC request. After it gets
the "not supported" error it does not try again.
<P>
If the RPC request fails for any reason, for example if the sponsor does
not support the new RPC request, the DMOD uses the old resource locating
algorithm.
<P>
No changes are required to existing emulators, including the 3270
application that ships with SNA Server.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This feature is included in the latest U.S. Service Pack for SNA Server for
Windows NT, version 2.11. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
