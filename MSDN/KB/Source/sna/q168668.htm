</PRE>For information about changes implemented in 3.0 SP2, see the 
SNA30SP2.HLP file included in 30SP2TXT.EXE, 30SP2IS.EXE or 
30SP2AS.EXE.  SNA30SP2.HLP also lists new features added in the 
service pack and articles describing the symptoms and causes for 
problems fixed in the service pack. 
<P>
NOTE 1: The SNA Server 3.0 SP2 includes updates to the SNA Server, 
Print Service, TN3270 Service, TN5250 Service, ODBC drivers, AFTP, 
and Shared Folders Gateway.
<P>
<P><h3>Instructions for Decompressing Files</h3>
 
<P>
All of the above files are Win32 self-extracting executables.  The 
SNA Server and client update programs automatically extract and run 
the Update program. For these Update programs to run automatically, 
the server or client machine must have the following free disk space:
<P>
<PRE>  Server Update (Intel) - 30SP2IS.EXE:  95 MB 
  Server Update (Alpha) - 30SP2AS.EXE:  105 MB
  Windows NT Client Update (Intel) - 30SP2ICU.EXE: 28 MB
  Windows NT Client Update (Alpha) - 30SP2ACU.EXE: 38 MB
  Windows 95 Client Update         - 30SP295U.EXE: 13 MB

</PRE>When running Update automatically, please note the following:
<P>
- before update is run, all files are automatically extracted to the 
<PRE>  directory where the TMP, TEMP, or WINROOT environment variable is 
  pointing (trying in that order). So, if the SET command shows that 
  TMP=C:\TMP , and C: does not have sufficient storage to extract the 
  files, change TMP to point to a drive which has sufficient space.  
  For example:  

    SET TMP=D:\TEMP

</PRE>- to extract the files into a separate directory without running update
<PRE>  automatically, run the service pack update file using the /x option. 
  For example:

    30SP2IS /x

</PRE>The SNA Server Windows 3.x client files (30SP2CLU.EXE, 30SP2CLR.EXE) 
are Win32 self extracting executables that cannot be run directly 
from a Windows 3.x machine. The administrator must first run the 
refresh file and choose a directory to place the extracted files. 
Windows 3.x clients may then connect across the network and run the 
Update program to apply the service pack files.
<P>
The SNA Server client refresh files (30SP2ICR.EXE, 30SP2ACR.EXE, 
30SP295R.EXE, 30SP2CLR.EXE) include the full client code, which 
already includes all 3.0 SP2 files. These refresh files each extract 
into a user-defined directory, though the setup program is not run 
automatically.
<P>
NOTE: Unlike previous SNA Server service packs, there is no need 
to extract the executable with the "-d" option.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the Service Pack Files</h3>
 
Both the SNA Server and SNA client files have been updated in 3.0 
SP2. Updates may be applied in any order -- to the server and/or to 
the clients. It is recommended that all systems running SNA 
Server 3.0 (that is, SNA Servers and client computers) are updated 
to 3.0 SP2. It may not be necessary to update the client computers 
to SP2 unless you are experiencing a client problem that has been 
fixed in SP2.
<P>
WARNING: This service pack update is intended to be applied on
systems currently running SNA Server 3.0 server or client software.  
These updates should NOT be applied over systems running SNA Server 
2.x releases.
<P>
** TO BE APPLIED TO SNA SERVER 3.0 SYSTEMS ONLY!! **
