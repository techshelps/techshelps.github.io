The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes performance enhancements that were made to SNA
Server service and client interfaces and how to obtain the update and how
to derive benefits from this update if you are using third-party 3270
emulation products that work over the LUA variant of the SNA Server EIS
interface.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The client-server protocol used to support the LUA-variant of the SNA
Server 3270 Emulator Interface Specification (EIS) and LUA RUI interface
has been enhanced to increase performance. The SNA Server service and
Win32, Win3.x, OS/2 and MS-DOS RUI client interfaces have been updated.
Down-level clients continue to function through the updated SNA Server
service.
<P>
Also, the SNA Server 3270 applets include an additional performance
improvement by requesting complete RUs rather than individual segments.
<P>
Any 3270 application that uses the LUA RUI interface, as well as any LUA
RUI application, performs faster with this update applied. However, 3270
applications which use the LUA variant of the SNA Server EIS interface may
require some further enhancements to take advantage of these performance
improvements. These enhancements are described in the To Implement The
Update section below.
<P>
To determine if a 3270 emulator uses the LUA-variant of the EIS interface,
enable SNA Server 3270 message tracing and open a 3270 session. If byte 34
of Element #1 in the Open(SSCP) message is set to 0x01, then the LUA
variant is being used. If byte 34 is set to 0x00, the LUA variant is not
being used and no further application changes are necessary to implement
the performance enhancements.
<P>
NOTE: The SNA Server 3270 applets use the LUA variant of the EIS interface.
These 3270 applets have been updated to implement the performance
enhancements described in this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Where Changes Were Made</h3>
 
<P>
The client-server message flow for the LUA-variant of the Emulator
Interface was less efficient than it could be. The following explains two
specific cases:

<UL><LI>When a Begin Bracket RU is received by the server, the server and client
   currently exchange a Status Control (BID) and acknowledgement before the
   data is sent to the client. Similarly, when a bracket officially ends,
   the server sends a Status (Betb) message. Both of these messages are
   redundant for the LUA interface, because the application processes the
   RH flags on the RUs NOT the FMI indicators.

<LI>When a client acknowledges a data message, it has to wait for the server
   to acknowledge the acknowledgement with an ACKLUA message. This is so
   that the server can verify that the correct sequence number is provided
   on the response. This message has been removed by making the RUI
   application or 3270 EIS/LUA application responsible for tracking
   sequence numbers. The 3270 applet already acknowledges the correct
   sequence number, so the handshake is redundant.
<P>
</UL>These changes have been implemented ensuring full backward compatability,
so the new clients and servers can co-exist with previous versions.
<P>
<P><h3>To Implement the Update</h3>
 
<P>
To improve performance of your SNA Server 2.11 and the 3270 applets:

<UL><LI>Contact Microsoft Product Support for the update.
<P>
</UL>To improve performance of your third-party 3270 emulation products which
work over the LUA variant of the SNA Server EIS interface:

<UL><LI>Contact Microsoft Product Support for the update.

<LI>Make the changes described below in the section titled Third-Party 3270
   Emulation Products to support the performance enhancements available
   with the update.
<P>
</UL>Microsoft updated the following files for the enhancements:
<P>
<PRE> &lt;snaroot&gt;\system\SNASERVR.EXE - SNA Server service
 &lt;snaroot&gt;\system\TRCSERVR.EXE - Special traced version of SNA Server
                                 service
 &lt;snaroot&gt;\system\WINRUI32.DLL - Win32 client RUI DLL
 &lt;winroot&gt;\system\WINRUI.DLL   - Win 3.x client RUI DLL
 &lt;snaroot&gt;\ACSRUI.DLL          - OS/2 client RUI DLL
 &lt;libs&gt;\dos\dosacs.lib         - MS-DOS client RUI link library
 &lt;libs&gt;\dos\dtracs.lib         - Traced version of MS-DOS client RUI
                                 link library
 &lt;snaroot&gt;\SYSTEM\FMIS3270.DLL - Win32 3270 applet module
 &lt;sna.win&gt;\FMIS3270.DLL        - Win 3.x 3270 applet module

</PRE><h3>Third-Party 3270 Emulation Products</h3>
 
<P>
Third-party 3270 emulation products which work over the LUA variant of the
SNA Server EIS interface require the following enhancements to support the
performance enhancements available with the Microsoft update. Those 3270
emulation products or LUA applications that communicate over the LUA RUI
interface do not require any modifications to obtain the performance
improvements, because these changes are implemented by the RUI library.
<P>
Here is the information necessary for third party 3270 emulation vendors
to implement these performance improvements:

<UL><LI>The LUA version number is contained in the Open(SSCP) request message
   at dataru[40] (dataru[39] is reserved and should be set to 0). The
   following are the supported values of the LUA version:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - 0x01 - the original (that is, unmodified) LUA version of the EIS.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - 0x02 - the new version incorporating the API changes below.
</PRE><P>
   If the emulator specifies a version greater than that supported by the
   current SNA Server, the server negotiates the version down on its
   Open (SSCP) response (see below). Modifications to the API are
   incremental; any emulator supporting any future version X must
   support all the version X-1 features.
<P>
   Note that startd must be set to 41 or greater. If startd is less than
   41, the emulator is indicating support for version 1 only.

<LI>SNA Server returns the version number to be used on the Open (SSCP)
   response message in the lower 7 bits of dataru[40] with the top bit
   always set to b'1'. If the emulator receives an Open (SSCP) response
   message with startd less than 41 or with the top bit of dataru[40]
   clear, it must assume that the node supports version 1 of the LUA
   version of the EIS only.

<LI>The Node continues to sent Status-Control (BID) messages when an
   explicit SNA BID request is received on the session (the RBI flag is set
   in the Application Flags bytes in the message header).

<LI>An emulator specifies that it is responsible for sequence number
   checking by setting the ackqual field of the Status-Acknowledge message
   to ACKLUA instead of ACKPOS. This causes the Node to generate a positive
   response on the session without returning a Status-Acknowledge (ACKLUA)
   message to the emulator. Note that if the emulator provides an incorrect
   sequence number no indication is sent to the emulator and no response
   is sent on the session. This change does not apply to negative responses
   or Status-Control-Acknowledge messages, for which emulators continue to
   receive Status-Acknowledge(ACKLUA) messages.
