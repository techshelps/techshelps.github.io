The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, and 4.0
</UL> 
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When the SNA client attempts to get its sponsor connection from a specific
SNA Server computer and it receives an error, the SNA client never tries to
connect to another sponsor server listed in its sponsor server list.
Instead, the SNA client repeatedly tries to connect to the first SNA Server
computer that it attempted to connect to.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
For SNA Server clients using Windows NT or Windows 95, a registry entry
must be added in order for users to specify a SponsorRetryDelay time in
case TerminateIfNoSponsors is disabled. This registry entry gives slow wide
area networks or SNA Server computers time to recover from failure.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
To work around the problem, add the following registry entry:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaBase\Parameters:
   SponsorRetryDelay:REG_DWORD:&lt;retry delay in seconds&gt;

</PRE>NOTE: The default retry delay is 15 seconds.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11,
3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0. A supported fix is now available, but has not
been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by
this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next
Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support
Services for more information.
