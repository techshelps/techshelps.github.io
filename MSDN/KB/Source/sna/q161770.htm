The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you stop the SnaBase service, you may encounter the following SnaBase
critical internal error:
<P>
<PRE>   Event: 560
   Description: Read from mailslot failed, rc = 6  (invalid handle)

</PRE>The SnaBase service treats the Event 560 error as a critical internal
error, causing the SnaBase to create an SNA Server dump file (Snadump.log).
However, once the SnaBase fails in this way, any TCP/IP sockets it had
opened are not closed. Any attempt to restart the SnaBase service then
leads to the following errors:
<P>
<PRE>   Event: 567
   Description: Creation of a named pipe failed, rc = 10048

   -or-

   Event: 553
   Description: Could not create mailslot, rc = 10048

</PRE>These errors are logged if SnaBase encounters problems creating the TCP/IP
sockets used to communicate to other servers. The 10048 socket error
indicates "Address in use." These errors are also treated as critical
internal errors by SnaBase, causing the creation of an SNA Server dump file
(Snadump.log, in the &lt;Snaroot&gt;\Traces directory) to be created for these
events as well. The only way to recover SNA Server at this point is to shut
down and restart the computer running Windows NT Server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Event 560 is treated as a critical internal error, causing SNA Server to
generate the Snadump.log file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. With this fix,
event 560 is treated as a lower severity error, so no SNA Server dump is
generated. If this error occurs when stopping SnaBase, an SNA Server dump
file is no longer created, so any TCP/IP resources are then closed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0,
2.1, and 2.11.
<PRE> A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully
</PRE>regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that
contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
