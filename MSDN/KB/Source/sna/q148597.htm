The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.11 Service Pack 1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1, the new 802.2 Distributed
Link Service feature does not support incoming calls.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If Distributed Link Service is set up to allow more than one SNA Server
to use the same Distributed Link Service, the link service does not know
which server to send the incoming XID. The chosen server may reject the
connection unless it is set up for incoming calls.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11
Service Pack 1.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An enhancement has been made for 802.2 Distributed Link Services. Some WAN
implementations benefit from decreased traffic on the network.
<P>
For example, an SNA Server uses an 802.2 Distributed Link Service to
connect to a Cluster Controller over Token Ring. The network is physically
separated into two segments, connected by an X.25 network. The SNA Server
that distributes the link is on the same segment as the Cluster Controller.
The SNA Server running the Distributed Link Service is located on the other
segment.
<P>
Since the X.25 line is billed by usage, it is necessary to limit the amount
of traffic in the WAN. Instead of keeping the connection Active
continuously, allowing the 802.2 Distributed Link Service to accept
incoming calls represents substantial savings due to the fact that the
connection remains inactive until needed.
<P>
NOTE: The SNA Server Link Service used is DLC 802.2 over Token Ring. The
WAN link uses the Packet Switched Network. If the connection is established
to use an X.25 Link Service, the above case does not apply.
