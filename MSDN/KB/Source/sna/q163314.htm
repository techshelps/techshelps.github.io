The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server version 2.1, 2.11, and 2.11 SP1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An SDLC connection from SNA Server may drop to a Pending state occasionally
when using a Microgate SDLC adapter. When this occurs, SNA Server may
log a message similar to the following in the Windows NT Application Event
Log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 23
   Description: Connection &lt;connection_name&gt; using Link Service
   &lt;link_service_name&gt; failed.

   Qualifier = 25

</PRE>NOTE: The qualifier may vary when this problem occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Ibmsync.sys driver that is used by the Microgate SDLC link service was
found to have a scheduling window that could cause occasional connection
outages as described above. There were two problems found and corrected in
the Ibmsync.sys driver:

<UL><LI>The problem caused messages to be lost or received out of order, but
   should only occur on high-speed SDLC lines.

<LI>The second problem may cause messages to be delayed in processing until
   another message arrives. This has only been seen when running at 2Mbps
   over the SDLC adapter, but again the window to hit the problem was there
   when running at lower speeds.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The Ibmsync.sys has been updated to correct the two problems described
above.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.1,
2.11, and 2.11 SP1.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
