The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.10, 2.11, and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how SNA Server uses identifying information (XIDs)
from incoming calls to help you decide which kind of remote node identifier
to specify for a connection that accepts incoming calls.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When SNA Server receives an XID from an incoming call such as a DSPU, host,
or AS/400, for instance, it looks at the XID for some kind of identifier of
the remote system that made the call. It compares this identifier, in the
order shown in the following list, against identifiers stored in the SNA
Server configuration. If it finds a match, it accepts the call. If it finds
that identifiers are left unspecified (in the configuration and/or the
XID), and the connection is an SDLC connection, SNA Server accepts the
call, pending further exchange of information. In other cases, if every
comparison yields a mismatch, or when identifiers are left unspecified and
the connection is 802.2 or X.25, SNA Server rejects the incoming call.
<P>
Identifiers are compared in the following order:

<OL><P><LI>If the incoming XID is Format 3, SNA Server examines the XID for a
   remote node Network Name and Control Point Name. If these parameters
   are present in both the incoming XID and in the SNA Server
   configuration, and they match, the call is accepted. If the parameters
   are present and do not match, the call is rejected.

<P><LI>If the parameters are not available for the preceding step, Remote Node
   IDs are examined next. Remote Node IDs may be used in either Format 0
   or Format 3 XIDs. If a Remote Node ID is present in both the incoming
   XID and in the SNA Server configuration, and they match, the call is
   accepted. If the parameters are present and do not match, the call is
   rejected.

<P><LI>If the parameters were not available for the preceding steps, for 802.2
   and X.25 connections, remote addresses are examined:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - For 802.2 connections, the Remote Network Address in the SNA Server
      configuration is compared to the address from which the XID was
      received. If the addresses match, the call is accepted; if not, the
      call is rejected.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: SNA Server 2.11 has a new feature that allows any client to
      attach to SNA Server regardless of an XID or remote network address
      match. To do this, configure the downstream connection's remote
      network address to be: 400000000000.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - For X.25 connections, the remote X.25 address in the SNA Server
      configuration is compared to the address from which the XID was
      received. If the addresses match, the call is accepted; if not, the
      call is rejected.
</PRE>
<P><LI>If no match is found in any of the preceding steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - For 802.2 and X.25 connections the incoming call is rejected.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - For SDLC connections, if identifiers were left unspecified in the
      configuration and/or the XID, the call is accepted, pending further
      exchange of identifiers. However, if identifiers were not left
      unspecified and no identifiers match, the call is rejected.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>To Enable Incoming Calls for a Specific Connection</h3>
 
<P>
For 2.11:

<OL><P><LI>In SNA Server Admin, go to Connection Properties for the specific
   connection.

<P><LI>Select Allowed Directions: Incoming Calls.
<P>
</OL>For 3.0:

<OL><P><LI>In SNA Server Manager, go to the properties page of the connection in
   question.

<P><LI>In the General tab, select Allowed Directions: Incoming Calls.
<P></OL>
