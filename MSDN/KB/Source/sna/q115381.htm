******************* Beginning of Readme ***************************
<P>
Product: Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT v2.0
Update:  Patch #42  (includes Patch #5, 11, 34 and 37)
Status:  Confirmed
<P>
PKZIP 2.04g format -- uncompress using the "-d" option.
<P>
Date: May 3, 1994
<P>
Modules updated:
<P>
<PRE> \SYSTEM\SNASERVR.EXE   04/18/94  05:54p  524800 (2.0.0.143)

</PRE>Bugs fixed:
<P>
2195  SNA Server DSPU connections not reactivating.
<P>
The fix for #2073 was not complete. While the internal gateway
error log entry no longer occurs during deactivation, this update
fixes an additional problem where downstream PU connections would
not reactivate.
<P>
2073  SNA Server internal gateway error (event 29, sense code 4596).
<P>
Observed when using the "exit all" option with the IBM PCOM 3270
emulator running as a downstream PU to SNA Server.  If an outage
occurs from a downstream PU after an Unbind request is sent to the
host, but the Unbind response not yet received, SNA Server sends
a termself (which the host rejects).  However, the host then sends
the Unbind response which the server is not expecting, so it logs
an error and fails to send the Notify(unavail) that the host is
expecting.  The LU is lost until SNA Server is recycled.
<P>
<P>
XXXX  Invalid SNA Server BIND response leads to sense code 1001000E.
<P>
SNA Server responds with all control vectors in response to a host BIND
message, though not all control vectors may be valid for the response.
This can lead to a host sense code of 1001000E, or invalid bind response.
<P>
2020  SNA Server hot backup fix for 5250 users.
<P>
When more than one SNA Server is configured to support 5250 sessions
(for hot backup purposes) and the link fails on one of the servers,
the client occasionally has to reopen a new session twice before
getting a session through the backup server.
<P>
1739  Server gp-fault when LU pool is opened and connections inactive
<P>
Start the SNA Server service but leave all connections inactive.  At
the client, open an LU Pooled session using the 3270 applet.  The customer
reports that the SNA Server encounters an access violation, though we
have been unable to reproduce the problem.
<P>
1765  Automatic 5250 device name generation fails after 10 users
<P>
This fix applies if over 10 SNA Server users are using the 5250
applet and sharing the same LU/LU pair when communicating to the
AS/400, and they are not specifying their own unique device names
when opening a session.  Under this situation, SNA Server automatically
generates unique device names for each client (to prevent conflicts in
the use of device names).  However, after 10 users, SNA Server fails
to generate valid unique device names.
<P>
<P>
Update Procedure:
<P>
- Stop the SNA Server service
<P>
- Copy the updated SNASERVR.EXE over the existing version in
the server's &lt;snaroot&gt;\SYSTEM directory.
<P>
- Restart SNA Server
<P>
