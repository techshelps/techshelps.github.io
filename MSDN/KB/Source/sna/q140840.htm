The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When SNA Server has two connections configured to use the same underlying
link service and same Remote Network Address, the remote end deactivates
the first connection as soon as an XID packet to activate the second
connection arrives.
<P>
It is true that two link stations cannot use the same source service access
point (SAP) address to the same destination link station. However, SNA
Server should not disrupt an already active connection when another request
arrives for the same Network address (or SAP) for the same link service.
<P>
With SNA Server 2.11 the following message appears when attempting to
configure two connections in this way:
<P>
<PRE> The same Remote Network Address and SAP have already been specified for
</PRE>this link service in connection &lt;connection name&gt;. To create more than one
connection to the same remote machine, add one of more 802.2/DLC link
services via SNA Server Setup over the same adapter with different local
SAP addresses. This will auto-create additional connections in SNA Server
Admin. Alternatively, if further SAPs are available at the remote machine,
choose a different remote SAP for this connection. OK.
<P>
After you choose OK, SNA Server does not force the Administrator to change
the the configuration. Therefore, the above problem results.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has a fix that does not prevent an Administrator from configuring
two connections for the same remote network address using the same link
service. The 808.2 Link Service now detects the address conflict and
disables the second connection with the following event id:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 205 - "An address pair is already in use."

</PRE>Note that it also detects the case where the address pair is first  in use
due to an incoming call as well as an outbound one.
<P>
Microsoft has updated the following files to correct this problem:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;snaroot&gt;\SYSTEM\SNASERVR.EXE
   &lt;snaroot&gt;\SYSTEM\TRCSERVR.EXE
   &lt;snaroot&gt;\SYSTEM\SNADLC.DLL
   &lt;snaroot&gt;\SYSTEM\SNAEVENT.DLL

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT.
This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
