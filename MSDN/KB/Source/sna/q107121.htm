<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1
   and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
The Operator Information Area (OIA)is used to display the status of a 3270
screen session. The OIA is the last (bottom) line displayed in the terminal
window of the 3270 session. Except for the initial three positions (system
connection indicators), status line indicators only appear when they apply.
<P>
The following tables describe the OIA and explain each indicator. In the
table, position refers to the column(s) that a specific indicator occupies
on the OIA, where the left-most column of the OIA is position 1. In
addition, the "female" symbol used for certain system connection and input
inhibited indicators cannot be displayed in this table. In its place is the
"^" symbol.
<P>
<P><h2>OIA INDICATOR (POSITION)</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>Symbol     Meaning
</PRE> 
System Connection (position 1):
Does not apply to the 3270 Applet.
<P>
System Connection (position 2):
<PRE>B          Connection uses an SNA protocol.
A          Connection uses a non-SNA protocol.

</PRE>System Connection (position 3):
<PRE>b          Connected to a host application (LU-LU session).
^          Connected to host system services (SSCP-LU session).
?          Session is established, but is not connected to any host program
           (unknown).

</PRE>Session ID (positions 4 - 7):
<PRE>aaaa       First four characters of your configured long name session ID.

</PRE>Input Inhibited messages (keyboard locked) (positions 9 - 17):
X COMMnnn  Communications error. See Communications Status
<PRE>           (positions 19 - 26).
</PRE>X MACHnnn  Computer check error.
X PROGnnn  Program check error. See Communications Status
<PRE>           (positions 19 – 26).
X SYSTEM   Keyboard input is being processed by the host. Wait for the
           message to clear or press RESET.
X[]        The host requires more time to process your request. Wait for
           the indicator to clear or press RESET.
X -f       Function is not supported. Press RESET, and select a valid
           function.
X^&gt;        More data was typed than the field allows or can accept.
           Press RESET, and re-enter the data.
X &lt;-^-&gt;    Protected field; you cannot type data. Press RESET, and move
           the cursor to an unprotected field.
X -f^X     Function is not authorized. Press RESET, and select a valid
           function.
X^+?       Invalid accent/character combination typed. The accent is
           displayed in position 12. Press RESET, and type a valid
           combination.

</PRE>Communications Status (positions 19 - 26):
<PRE>COMM500    All the link services configured for use by the connection
           were inactive.
COMM504    Communications are not established with the host. This
           message disappears as soon as communication is established with
           the host. If this message does not disappear, check to ensure
           proper settings of the host network address, local node ID, or
           local SAP.
COMM505    The host terminated the connection used by your 3270 session.
COMM510    The host has deactivated the communications link. Report the
           message to your system administrator.
COMM518    A segment was out of sequence. Contact your system
           administrator.
COMM695    A communications error occurred.
COMM5nn    The communications link is still being established; the keyboard
           is locked. Wait for the message to clear; also check Input
           Inhibited messages.
PROG703    A session control, data flow control, or network control command
           is not supported. Press RESET, and try the operation again.
PROG705    A sequence number error has occurred. Press RESET, and try the
           operation again.
PROG706    A chaining error has occurred. Press RESET, and try the
           operation again.
PROG707    A bracket state error has occurred. Press RESET, and try the
           operation again.
PROG708    A data traffic reset state exists. Press RESET, and try the
           operation again.
PROG717    The support level requested is not valid. Press RESET, and
           try the operation again.
PROG723    The LU type requested is not valid. Press RESET, and try the
           operation again.
PROG724    The screen size requested is not valid. Press RESET, and try
           the operation again.

</PRE>Screen Session LU Address (positions 79 - 80):
<PRE>nn         The LU address of the currently displayed 3270 screen session.

</PRE>ERROR 83:
<PRE>   The LU selected is not valid for the logged on user. There is a
   configuration problem if this appears, because the emulator only
   presents the user with LUs they are allowed to use. Verify the user can
   use this LU.

</PRE>ERROR 85:
<PRE>   The primary reason for this error is the specific LU requested is
   already in use.

</PRE>ERROR 87:
<PRE>   There are several possibilities for this error:
    - All the LUs in the Pool requested are in use and will not be
      available until someone logs off.
    - One or more servers or connections are inactive, and need to be
      started before all the LUs in the Pool are available.
