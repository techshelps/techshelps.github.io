The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
SNA Server's Host Print Service rejects LU3 print jobs that contain X'27'
control codes. The X'27' control code is the EBCDIC equivalent of an ASCII
X'1B' control code. The ASCII X'1B' control code is the PCL Escape code for
Hewlett-Packard Printer Control Language (PCL) printers.
<P>
When the print server receives an LU3 print job that contains an invalid
EBCDIC control code, it returns an IBM sense code X'1003' to SNA Server.
SNA Server then sends an -RSP message to the host with the X'1003' sense
code, which terminates the print job.
<P>
Note: All EBCDIC codes below X'40' are invalid.
<P>
Sense Code X'1003' is defined in the IBM SNA Formats Guide (GA27-3136) as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Function not supported: The function requested is not supported. The
   function may have been specified by a formatted request code, a field in
   an RU, or a control character.

</PRE>SNA Server logs the following message in the Application Event log when
this problem occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 21
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: (X'1124') Negative Response Sent on Connection &lt;connection
   name&gt; (SENSE = 1003)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The print service is designed to reject invalid EBCDIC control codes.
Because the X'27' control code is below X'40', it is rejected with a
X'1003' sense code.
<P>
The LU3 print data stream was not intended to support the inclusion of PCL
control codes that were intended to be passed to PCL printers. LU1 print
jobs do support transparent sections that can include PCL control codes.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0,
3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
The print service has been updated to accommodate LU3 print jobs that
contain PCL control codes that begin with X'27' control codes. In addition
to obtaining the fix for this problem, the following steps also need to be
performed to allow the X'27' control codes to be accepted by the print
server:

<OL><P><LI>Add the following registry entry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
      \SnaPrint\Parameters\LetHex27Pass: REG_SZ: &lt;value&gt;
</PRE><P>
   Where: Value can be set to anything (for example, Yes, On, and so on).
   As long as this parameter exists, the X'27' control codes will be
   accepted by the print server.

<P><LI>Configure a Custom Code Page that maps the EBCDIC X'27' code to an ASCII
   X'1B' code. Please refer to Appendix E of the online version of the SNA
   Server 3.0 Reference Guide for details on Custom Code Pages.

<P><LI>Configure and use a Printer Definition Table (PDT) file for the print
   sessions that will be printing the LU3 jobs that contain these control
   codes. The PDT file does not need to contain any special options. The
   default hplj2.pdf file included with SNA Server can be compiled and
   used. This is needed so that the print job is not passed through
   Graphical Device Interface (GDI). Please refer to Chapter 7 of the
   online version of the SNA Server 3.0 Reference Guide for details on
   PDTs.
