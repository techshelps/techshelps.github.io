The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The SNA Server service may stop unexpectedly and log the following 
Event ID in the Windows NT Event Viewer Application log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 685
   Source:   SNA Server
   Description: An attempt was made to extend a buffer pool, but 
   the related pool had reached its maximum size. The affected component 
   is terminating, and an audit of the buffer pools just before 
   termination is attached

   &lt;the data will indicate a large number of trusted headers owned by the
    SNASERVR process &gt;

</PRE>This event will be preceded by numerous Event 684 messages, which indicate 
that the SNA Server's trusted header use is growing by about 150 per 
minute until the maximum trusted header pool is reached (of 100,000). 
When this occurs, SNA Server stops.
<P>
This problem coincides with the use of an APPC application that uses the
DISPLAY API function to retrieve all LU6.2 configuration and state 
information.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When receiving an APPC DISPLAY request from an APPC application to 
retrieve LU6.2 information, SNA Server occasionally allocates an extra 
trusted header it doesn't actually use and then fails to free it.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 
3.0 SP1 and 3.0 SP2.  This problem is fixed in SNA 4.0.
<P>
A supported fix is now available for SNA 3.0, but has not been fully 
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing 
this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific 
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack 
that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for 
more information.
