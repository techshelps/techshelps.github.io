The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
SNA Server Manager does not allow a single LUA Pool to be assigned to more
than one TN3270 service in an SNA Server subdomain. This prevents multiple
TN3270 servers from sharing a large pool of LUA sessions across more than
one SNA Server computer, limiting flexibility in some fail-over
configurations.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
SNA Server Manager was not originally designed to allow a single LUA Pool
to be assigned to more than one TN3270 server in an SNA Server subdomain.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server
version 3.0 (all service packs) and SNA Server 4.0.
<P>
A new feature that allows you to assign a single LUA pool to two TN3270
servers is now available, but due to the complexity of the configuration
changes it has only been implemented in SNA Server 4.0. Customers using SNA
Server 3.0 must first upgrade to SNA Server 4.0 and then request this
enhancement from Microsoft. This feature has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following SNA Server 4.0 modules have been updated to support this new
capability:
<P>
<PRE>  &lt;snaroot&gt;\system\snaadmin.dll
  &lt;snaroot&gt;\system\snaole.dll
  &lt;snaroot&gt;\system\snacfg.exe


</PRE>An LUA Pool can now be assigned to more than one TN3270 server. However,
all the TN3270 properties associated with the LUA Pool must be identical
for all TN3270 servers.
<P>
When an LUA Pool is assigned to a second TN3270 server, it inherits all the
same properties (including Port number, IP addresses, and so on) that
already exist for that LUA Pool. If any properties are modified on the
Pool, then they are modified for all the TN3270 servers.
<P>
A new message is displayed when you try to assign a second instance of an
LUA Pool to a TN3270 server. The message is: "Pool already assigned to this
TN3270 Server."
<P>
The SNACFG.EXE command-line configuration utility has been updated to
reflect this new capability. There is no new syntax. However, the
"tn3session &lt;name&gt; /ADD" command is now allowed if the name matches an LUA
Pool name and that pool is not already assigned to the TN3270 server.
Entering the "tn3session /DELETE" command will delete the session from all
the TN3270 servers that it is assigned to. Modifying a tn3session will
cause all the sessions of that name to be modified in the same way. For
this reason, the /TN3Server option is no longer valid for the modify
operation.
<P>
The SNACFG.EXE file is also modified so that a TNIPID /LIST will now show
all the TNIPID records. Entering "TNIPID &lt;name&gt; /ADD /SESSION:&lt;tn3sess&gt;"
will add the record to all the TN3270 sessions with the same name. Entering
TNIPID modify or /DELETE will operate on all the TNIPID records with the
same name.
