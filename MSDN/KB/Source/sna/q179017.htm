The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11SP1, 2.11SP2, 3.0, 3.0SP1,
   3.0SP2, 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There may be occasions where it will be necessary to migrate your existing SNA 
Server configuration to a new computer, or to restore to an existing computer
in the event it is rebuilt due to a hardware failure.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: It is VERY IMPORTANT to keep a backup copy of your SNA configuration file 
in a place where it would be unaffected by a harware failure and in a place where 
it will not be accidentally deleted. Update the configuration EVERY time a 
modification is made. Without a valid current backup, complete restoration of the 
existing configuration is impossible.
<P>
For more information on backup and restore of the configuration file, please see 
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../SNA/Q112636.htm">Q112636</A></B>
   TITLE: Backup and Restore of COM.CFG

</PRE>This scenario assumes that the SNA Subdomain consists of only a single SNA 
server and it is properly configured as the Primary Configuration Server. This 
procedure would be used in the event of a computer replacement or a complete 
rebuild of an existing computer following a fatal hardware problem.

<OL><P><LI>Verify that you have a valid backup of your configuration file.
</OL>2. Use the Snacfg.exe utility to have a text copy printed to be used in steps 5
<PRE>   and 7.
</PRE></OL>3. Remove server from the network physically by shutting the computer off. Then 
<PRE>   remove the server's machine account in the Windows NT Domain using Server 
   manager.
</PRE>4. Install Windows NT Server along with current Service Pack levels. Add the 
<PRE>   computer to the Windows NT domain with the same machine name as the original.
   Also verify that the same LAN transport protocols are installed. If using 
   TCP/IP, make sure that the proper IP address is assigned.
</PRE>5. Install SNA Server. Make sure that proper Link Services are installed. These
<PRE>   would normally be the same Link Services that were installed previously
   unless the server to host physical connection has been changed. For example, 
   a Token Ring card was replaced by Ethernet.
</PRE>6. Restore the SNA Configuration from backup file.
7. Make sure that connections are configured with the proper Link Service.
8. After verifying proper operation, update SNA Server to the Service Pack level
<PRE>   that was installed previously, or to the latest Service Pack if a newer one
   is available.
</PRE>9. Backup configuration file in a place where it would be unaffected by a
<PRE>   harware failure and in a place where it will not be accidentally deleted.
