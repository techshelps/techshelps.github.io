The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1,
   and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
SNA Server uses broadcasts to propagate its Service Table updates to other
SNA server computers in the domain. This is necessary to keep all SNA
Server computers abreast of any configuration change that is made or any
action that is being taken in the SNA Server domain. SNA Server version 2.1
and later provides choices that allow an administrator of an SNA Server
network to optimize the way this Service Table propagation occurs. This
article should be read as a supplement to the Server Broadcasts dialog box
Help file that can be launched from within the Server Broadcasts dialog
box.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>SNA Server 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
By default, SNA Server 2.0 sends broadcasts using the following method:
<P>
- WriteFile API call:
<P>
SNA Server uses a WriteFile API call to send broadcasts to other SNA Server
computers in the domain. It does this by submitting a WriteFile API call
that is sent in turn over all network protocols that the Workstation
Service is bound to. For instance, if the Workstation Service is bound to
NetBEUI, TCP/IP, and NWLink NetBIOS, SNA Server sends MailSlot broadcasts
over all three of these protocols. Sending MailSlot broadcasts over all
transports is a function of the WriteFile API call. This may cause
unnecessary network traffic, however. In SNA Server 2.0, there is no way to
disable this other than to remove unnecessary protocols from the Network
applet in Control Panel.
<P>
- IPX Sockets if NWLink is installed:
<P>
If NWLink is installed, SNA Server 2.0 will send a mailslot broadcast over
NWLink NetBIOS as described above, using the WriteFile API AND over a well-
known IPX socket.
<P>
- TCP/IP MailSlots:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
If the SNA Server computers are divided by TCP/IP routers, then enable the
following registry parameter:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Snabase\Parameters\
   : EnableIPMailSlots:REG_SZ:YES

</PRE>With this value enabled, SNA Server will send MailSlot broadcasts to domain
controllers in the domain using only TCP/IP, even though other protocols
may be installed. If the SNA Server computers do not reside on a domain
controller with this option chosen, no SNA Server computer will “listen”
for these MailSlots.
<P>
- For Comm Server Support:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
By default, SNA Server 2.0 has turned on support for Comm Server Gateways,
sending specific MailSlot broadcasts that they can recognize. If there are
no Comm Server computers in the domain, add the following value to:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Snabase\Parameters\
   : CommServerSupport:REG_SZ:NO

</PRE>Setting this value to NO will reduce broadcast traffic by nearly one-half.
<P>
<P><h3>SNA Server 2.1, 2.11, and 2.11 SP1</h3>
 
<P>
SNA Server Admin enables the user to choose how two or more SNA Server
computers communicate with each other. Go to the Server Broadcasts dialog
box under the Options menu in SNA Server Admin. This dialog box includes
the following choices:
<P>
<PRE>   - Microsoft Networking
   - Novell NetWare (IPX/SPX)
   - Banyan Vines/IP
   - Windows Sockets (TCP/IP)
   - Router Server Broadcasts over IP routers

   - SNA Server 2.0 servers in the same domain
   - DCA/Microsoft Comm Server Client Support

</PRE>- Microsoft Networking:
<P>
When you select the “Microsoft Networking” option only, SNA Server versions
2.1, 2.11, and 2.11 SP1 send MailSlot broadcasts using the WriteFile API,
just as SNA Server 2.0 does by default. SNA Server does this by submitting
a WriteFile API call that is sent in turn over all network protocols that
the Workstation Service is bound to. For instance, if the Workstation
Service is bound to NetBEUI, TCP/IP, and NWLink NetBIOS, SNA Server sends
MailSlot broadcasts over all three of these protocols. Sending MailSlot
broadcasts over all transports is a function of the WriteFile API call.
This may cause unnecessary network traffic, however.
<P>
- Native Transport Interface:
<P>
Unlike 2.0, SNA Server versions 2.1, 2.11, and 2.11 SP1 have options that
enable the user to choose to send over selected native transports instead
of using the WriteFile API call. These other choices are:
<P>
<PRE>   - Novell NetWare (IPX/SPX)
   - Banyan Vines/IP
   - Windows Sockets (TCP/IP)

</PRE>For example, if TCP/IP is installed on all SNA Server computers, then you
want to deselect “Microsoft Networking” and select “Windows
Sockets (TCP/IP)”. This will reduce the number of MailSlot broadcasts
by sending over only one transport - TCP/IP in this case.
<P>
- Comm Server Support:
<P>
If there are no DCA/Microsoft Comm Server clients or servers, disable the
following Comm Server Support options: "SNA Server 2.0 servers in the same
domain" and "DCA/Microsoft Comm Server Client Support".
<P>
Clearing these values will reduce broadcast traffic by nearly one-half.
<P>
- TCP/IP MailSlots:
<P>
When SNA Server computers are separated by TCP/IP routers, select "Route
Server Broadcasts over IP routers" if there is an IP router separating SNA
Server computers. This is equivalent to setting EnableIPMailslots to YES
under 2.0. As in 2.0, SNA Server will send MailSlot broadcasts to domain
controllers in the domain over TCP/IP only, even though other protocols may
be installed. For this configuration, SNA Server computers must be
installed on primary or backup domain controllers. If the SNA Server
computers do not reside on a domain controller with this option chosen, no
SNA Server computer will “listen” for these MailSlots. Note: This option
can only be chosen if “Microsoft Networking” is chosen.
<P>
<P><h3>SNA Server 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
SNA Server Manager enables you to choose how two or more SNA Server
computers communicate with each other. Go to the Server Broadcasts tab
under the Properties page for the SNA Server Subdomain in SNA Server
Manager. The Server Broadcasts tab includes the following choices:
<P>
<PRE>   - Microsoft Networking (Named Pipes)
   - IPX/SPX (Novell NetWare)
   - TCP/IP
   - Banyan Vines

</PRE>- Microsoft Networking:
<P>
When you select only the "Microsoft Networking" option, SNA Server 3.0
sends MailSlot broadcasts using the WriteFile API, just as the previous
versions of SNA Server do by default. Version 3.0 does this by submitting a
WriteFile API call that is sent in turn over all network protocols that the
Workstation Service is bound to. For example, if the Workstation Service is
bound to NetBEUI, TCP/IP, and NWLink NetBIOS, SNA Server sends MailSlot
broadcasts over all three of these protocols. Sending MailSlot broadcasts
over all transports is a function of the WriteFile API call. This may cause
unnecessary network traffic, however.
<P>
- Native Transport Interface:
<P>
SNA Server 3.0 has options that enable you to choose to send over selected
native transports instead of using the WriteFile API call. These other
choices are:
<P>
<PRE>   - IPX/SPX (Novell NetWare)
   - TCP/IP
   - Banyan Vines

</PRE>For example, if TCP/IP is installed on all SNA Server computers, then you
want to clear "Microsoft Networking" and select “TCP/IP”. This cuts down on
the number of MailSlot broadcasts by only sending over one transport -
TCP/IP in this case.
<P>
- TCP/IP MailSlots:
<P>
Unlike previous versions of SNA Server, SNA Server 3.0 does not have a
"Route Server Broadcasts over IP routers" option. With SNA Server 3.0, each
SNA Server computer builds a list of other SNA Server computers in its
subdomain. The list of servers is built based on the current SNA Server
configuration file. During installation, the SNA Server 3.0 Setup program
tries to dynamically locate the primary SNA Server computer, based on a UDP
broadcast datagram. If this fails, the Setup program displays a prompt
asking for the primary SNA Server computer's name. Backup SNA Server
computers store in their registry the name of the primary SNA Server
computer. Member SNA Server computers store in their registry the names of
all of the SNA Server computers in their subdomain.
<P>
Due to this change, SNA Server 3.0 does not have to be installed on Windows
NT domain controllers even if the subdomain spans IP routers.
