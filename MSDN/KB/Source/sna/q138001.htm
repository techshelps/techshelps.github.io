The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.11 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attach to shared folders on an AS/400, where the security level is
set to 30 or higher, and security has been set on the folders to allow
limited access, after the first user connects to a shared folder, all
subsequent users acquire the first user's access permissions to shared
folders.
<P>
This problem occurs when SNA Server is sharing a single Local APPC LU when
communicating to an AS/400.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The security for shared folders on the AS/400 (when security is set to
level 30 or higher), is tied to the controller. In this case, the AS/400
views the controller as its Remote LU, or SNA Server's Local APPC LU.
<P>
The transaction program which supports the shared folders function on the
AS/400 identifies a user based on the SNA Server Local APPC LU name being
used. Therefore, if multiple SNA Server users are sharing the same Local
APPC LU for use with shared folders, you are able to view each other's
AS/400  folders. Due to the design of the AS/400 shared folders feature,
the first shared folder's user to connect over a Local APPC LU determines
the AS/400 security rights for the remaining users who connect over the
same Local APPC LU.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Create a separate LU (Local to the SNA Server) for each user and pair each
LU with the AS/400's LU. Then each user accesses a separate controller and
has appropriate access to shared folders. In addition, each shared folder's
client application must be configured with a unique Local APPC LU alias.
If you prefer to leave this field empty, the SNA Server administrator can
assign a default Local APPC LU alias for each user using SNA Admin (2.x) or
SNA Server Manager (3.x) configured on the user record.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
IBM has stated that this is "by design," since shared folders were
originally intended to be accessed directly and not over parallel sessions
from a single LU-LU pair.
<P>
The AS/400 is manufactured by IBM, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
