The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1),
   2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0SP2, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An SDLC connection from SNA Server to a front-end processor (FEP) remains
in a pending state after the host performs an IPL. The only means of
recovery is to stop and restart the SNA Server service.
<P>
SNA Server may post an Event 23 in the Windows NT application event log
with a qualifier of 00A1 or 0025 as a result of these symptoms.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
SNA Server is erroneously handling the non-activation XIDs sent from the
FEP on an SDLC connection and treating this as a connection outage.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11,
2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1), and 2.11 SP2. A supported fix is now available
for 2.11 SP2, but has not been fully regression-tested and should be
applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0,
3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With the fix applied, the Ibmsdlc.DLL interface allows for the correct
handling of SDLC non-activation XIDs.
<P>
The SNA Server Ibmsdlc.dll (SDLC Link Service) file supports a "dumb card"
driver interface that is published in the appendix of the SNA Device
Interface Specification (SNADIS) guide. This link service will work with
any dumb card implementation, such as Ibmsync.sys (the IBMSDLC driver),
Microgate, DCA ISCA, Attachmate SDLC, as well as others.
<P>
Other SDLC link services implement the full SNADIS interface so the
Ibmsdlc.dll is not used. Some examples of these link services
include Eicon SDLC and Barr SDLC.
