The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the issues related to running SNA Server version 2.0
on Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 or Windows NT Server
version 3.5. This includes updates to SNA Server version 2.0 that should be
applied to run properly.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>SNA Server 2.0 Setup May GP Fault</h3>
 
<P>
This problem will not occur if SNA Server was previously installed on the
computer (even if it was subsequently removed), and the computer was
upgraded from Windows NT version 3.1 to Windows NT version 3.5.
<P>
However, if SNA Server was not previously installed, the SNA Server version
2.0 Setup program encounters a general protection (GP) fault when it is
being installed on a Windows NT 3.5 Server. This was a bug in the SNA
Server version 2.0 Setup program in the way it adds its performance monitor
key for "Frames Received." This bug was uncovered by the addition of a
"Frames Received" performance monitor counter within Remote Access Service
(RAS) included with Windows NT Server version 3.5.
<P>
Resolution:

<UL><LI>While SNA Server version 2.0 Setup has failed, all SNA Server modules
   are in fact installed at this point. While SNA Server performance
   monitor counters will not appear, the administrator can manually add SNA
   Server icons for the key SNA Server programs, including:
<P>
<P><PRE>       - SNA Server Setup (&lt;snaroot&gt;\SETUP.EXE)
       - SNA Server 3270 applet (&lt;snaroot&gt;\SYSTEM\WIN3270.EXE)
       - SNA Server 5250 applet (&lt;snaroot&gt;\SYSTEM\WIN5250.EXE)
       - SNA Server Admin (&lt;snaroot&gt;\SYSTEM\SNAADMIN.EXE)
       - SNA Server Trace (&lt;snaroot&gt;\SYSTEM\SNATRACE.EXE)
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>Apply SNA Server version 2.0 hotfix patch #39 (updated SETUPSVC.DLL),
   available through Microsoft Product Support Services.
<P>
   This update should replace the version located in the SNA Server
   installation tree before trying to install on Windows NT version 3.5.
   While it's not possible to update a CD-ROM, it's possible to copy the
   contents of the SNA Server version 2.0 CD-ROM to the local drive,
   replace SETUPSVC.DLL, and then install from the local drive.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h3>SNA Server Version 2.0 Admin Problem Adding Users</h3>
 
<P>
Because the Windows NT LMCMNUI0.DLL file changed names to NETUI1.DLL, the
SNA Server version 2.0 Admin program displays an "Unable to locate DLL -
LMUICMN0.DLL" message when you select the "Add User" dialog box.
<P>
Resolution:

<UL><LI>It's still possible to add a user/group, though this will need to be
   added manually, rather than selecting from a list box of Windows NT
   accounts.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Apply SNA Server version 2.0 hotfix patch #10 and #17 (updated
   SNAADMIN.EXE and SNAMANAG.DLL), available through Microsoft Product
   Support Services.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h3>SNA Server 802.2, SDLC and X.25 Link Services Fail to Initialize</h3>
 
<P>
When you start the SNA Server service, the underlying link services
installed on the computer will start automatically. However, these link
services fail to initialize.
<P>
Resolution:
<P>
The SNA directory on the Windows NT version 3.5 CD-ROM includes SNA Server
version 2.0 link service updates that correct these problems. This includes
updated versions of SNADLC.DLL, IBMSDLC.DLL, and IBMX25.DLL. These updated
link services should be copied to the &lt;snaroot&gt;\SYSTEM directory.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>SNA Server Admin Program GP Faults When You Zoom On Any List Box</h3>
 
<P>
This problem is not specific to Windows NT version 3.5, though is included
here for completeness.
<P>
SNA Server version 2.0 includes a version of CTL3D32.DLL for 3-D visual
effects. Beta versions of Word and Excel written to 32-bit Windows also
include a version of this same DLL, though this causes SNA Server Admin to
encounter an application exception if this version is present on the
computer.
<P>
Resolution:

<UL><LI>Rename any duplicate versions of CTL3D32.DLL on the computer (for
   example, change it to CTL3D32.OLD) so that only the version included
   with SNA Server is used.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Rename any duplicate versions of CTL3D32.DLL on the computer (for
   example, change it to CTL3D32.OLD) so that only the version included
   with SNA Server is used.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Start the SNA Server Admin program using the /NO3D switch (that is,
   SNAADMIN /NO3D).
