<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the major new features of SNA Server 2.11, as
included in the SNA Server 2.11 Enhancements Guide, along with some updated
technical information on some of the features.
<P>
<P><h3>PowerPC Platform Support</h3>
 
<P>
To run on a PowerPC, Windows NT 3.51 is required.  However, SNA Server 2.11
is also supported on Windows NT 3.5.
<P>
SNA Server 2.11 adds support for the PowerPC architecture. This allows you
to run SNA Server on new computers based on the PowerPC processors from
IBM, Motorola and others. Combined with the current support for Intel, MIPS-
and Alpha-based systems, SNA Server now supports the widest variety and the
most scalable set of hardware platforms of all the SNA gateways on the
market today.
<P>
<P><h3>Support for TN3270 Clients</h3>
 
<P>
SNA Server 2.11 includes a TN3270 Service which runs on the same computer
as SNA Server and allows any client running a TN3270 emulator, such as a
UNIX-based workstation, to connect to the IBM mainframe through SNA Server.
This feature allows customers to use TN3270 emulators on their desktops,
yet keep the hosts running the native and optimized SNA protocols, saving
the cost and the performance penalty of installing and running TCP/IP on
the mainframe.
<P>
The TN3270 Service supports 10,000 sessions (up to 2000 users running
multiple sessions), making this the highest capacity TN3270 gateway on the
market. The TN3270 Service allows TN3270 clients to connect to a host
through any of the connections supported by SNA Server. It communicates
with TN3270 clients via TCP/IP sessions running the TN3270 option of the
Telnet protocol and does not require installation of an SNA Server client
on the user's workstation. The TN3270 Service gives administrators more
control over resources by allowing specific IP addresses to be assigned to
LUs. The TN3270 Service supports any third-party TN3270 emulator that uses
the DO TERMTYPE option of Telnet, for any client operating system.
<P>
<P><h3>ODBC/DRDA Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
SNA Server 2.11 includes Open Database Connectivity/Distributed Relational
Database Architecture (ODBC/DRDA) drivers for Windows operating system- and
Windows NT-based clients, enabling standard desktop applications that
support database connectivity via ODBC, such as Microsoft Excel and
Microsoft Access, to access IBM host databases without an expensive host-
based database gateway. These drivers support connectivity to the following
IBM host databases: DB2 for MVS, SQL/DS for VM, and DB2/400 for OS/400. A
single-user ODBC/DRDA license is included with SNA Server 2.11. See the
enclosed license card for instructions on obtaining additional licensing.
<P>
<P><h3>SNA Remote Access Service</h3>
 
<P>
Prior versions of SNA Server already support the full SNA client
functionality for remote clients dialing into the LAN using the Remote
Access Service (RAS) of Windows NT Server. SNA Server version 2.11 adds a
feature that allows administrators to create virtual LAN connections
between Windows NT systems across an existing SNA network. This is achieved
by integrating SNA Server's LU6.2 transport with the RAS architecture,
allowing the use of familiar RAS tools to initiate remote network
connections across the SNA network and to benefit from the data
compression, administration, and security features built into RAS.
Customers with large SNA wide-area backbones now can access remote LANs and
servers without setting up redundant LAN-to-LAN networks or having to
install a dial-up modem in each remote branch office. This feature is
particularly useful for network administrators who need to manage remote
branch offices connected to the corporation's mainframe or AS/400 only
through low-speed synchronous data-link control (SDLC) lines.
<P>
The SNA Server Remote Access Service is supported on top of Windows NT 3.5
or 3.51 client machines. This feature is not available from Windows 3.x or
WFW clients.
<P>
<P><h3>Support for IBM's New Client Access/400 Product</h3>
 
<P>
SNA Server 2.11 adds support for IBM's new CA/400 product, which is a
Windows-based front-end package to access AS/400 applications and data. The
Windows-based client component of SNA Server 2.11 is enhanced to be
compatible with the CA/400 router, allowing users to replace the CA/400
router and connect to the AS/400 via an SNA Server. Users benefit from
using an IBM-endorsed client package to access the new OS/400 V3R1
operating system for the AS/400, while getting the benefits of the leading
SNA gateway to offload communications processing from the AS/400, saving
CPU and memory resources on the host. When using Windows for Workgroups or
the upcoming Windows 95 operating system, SNA Server allows the Windows-
based desktops to run protected-mode LAN protocols only, saving precious MS-
DOS operating system-based memory and making the overall Windows
environment more stable. Network administrators will benefit from the
reduced administration requirements for both the AS/400 and the Windows-
based desktops.
<P>
<P><h3>EHNAPPC API Support</h3>
 
<P>
SNA Server 2.11 adds support for the EHNAPPC application programming
interface (API) which is the Windows-based APPC API supported by IBM's PC
Support and Client Access/400 (CA/400) products. IBM has presented EHNAPPC
API to its independent software vendor (ISV) community as the way to write
Windows-based applications that integrate with the AS/400. There are
estimated to be more than 60 applications that utilize this API as a way to
connect to the AS/400 data and applications. These ISV applications will
work unchanged with SNA Server 2.11.
<P>
<P><h3>Support for 16-bit SNA Applications on Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
A set of new Dynamic-Link Libraries (DLLs) included with SNA Server version
2.11 maps the 16-bit SNA API to native 32-bit SNA APIs, allowing users to
run all the 16-bit Windows-based applications that work with SNA Server in
the 32-bit Windows NT environment. This feature brings the Windows NT-based
clients to parity with Windows-based clients for running SNA applications.
<P>
The 16-bit SNA API's which are now supported on Windows NT running the
32-bit SNA Server client software include APPC, CPIC, LUA and Common
Service Verbs. The 16-bit Emulator Interface Specification (EIS) API, used
by 16-bit 3270 applications, is not supported on top of the 32-bit SNA
Server client software.
<P>
<P><h3>Drivers for IBM and Andrew Twinaxial Adapters</h3>
 
<P>
New drivers included with SNA Server 2.11 allow SNA Servers to be connected
to AS/400s using twinaxial cabling, the native way to connect to an AS/400.
These drivers, developed for Microsoft by Andrew Corp., provide a cost-
effective option to connect the PC LANs to the AS/400s for the estimated 70
percent of the 300,000 AS/400s installed worldwide that do not yet have LAN
adapters. Instead of spending as much as $3,200 for a token ring adapter
for the AS/400, a $350 twinaxial adapter can be installed on the SNA Server
computer, providing up to 512 host sessions for the LAN clients attached to
the SNA Server.
<P>
The Andrew Twinax link service supports the Andrew 3xTwin Adapter, and is
available for the Intel platform. The IBM Twinax link service supports the
IBM 5250 Enhanced Adapter, or compatible, and is available for the Intel
platform. (There are register-compatible cards from independent hardware
vendors, such as DCI.)
<P>
For a full list of and contact information for third-party vendors
providing adapters, see the SNA Server Companion Product Catalog,
ISVCATAL.DOC, in the \COLLATRL\GENERAL directory on the SNA Server CD-ROM.
Updates to this catalog are distributed on the Microsoft TechNet CD-ROM and
posted on the MSSNA Compuserve Forum, the latest third party companion
guide can be found on Lib #1, called ISVCAT.EXE, which self-extracts to a
Word for Windows document.
<P>
<P><h3>Drivers for Barr Systems and Bus-Tech Channel Adapters</h3>
 
<P>
SNA Server 2.11 includes drivers for Barr Systems and Bus-Tech channel
adapters, which allow the SNA Server to be directly connected to an IBM
mainframe channel. The direct channel attachment can provide a significant
improvement in performance compared to other ways of attaching SNA Servers
to the host. An SNA Server running on a multiprocessor Pentium* or RISC
system with two LAN and two channel adapters installed can challenge the
overall performance and capacity of some of the fastest IBM controllers and
front-end processors. The Barr channel link service supports the Barr S/370
Channel adapter, available for the Intel, MIPS, and Alpha AXP platforms.
The Bus-Tech channel link service supports the BTI Channel adapter,
available for the Intel platform.
<P>
<P><h3>Additional SDLC Driver Support</h3>
 
<P>
Link services have been added for Attachmate SDLC and Attachmate Advanced
SDLC cards for the Intel platform, and for a Barr SDLC card for the MIPS
and Alpha AXP platforms.
<P>
<P><h3>AFTP Client and Server utilities</h3>
 
<P>
SNA Server version 2.11 includes a set of utilities that enable high-speed
file transfer between Windows NT-based systems and IBM hosts. APPC File
Transfer Protocol (AFTP) is an IBM-developed protocol that duplicates for
the SNA environment the function of the popular FTP utility in the TCP/IP
environment. IBM now is offering the host component of AFTP at a nominal
cost for most of the host operating systems. AFTP allows customers to
perform multi-megabyte file transfers between the host and the Windows NT-
based system quickly using native SNA protocols, eliminating the need to
install the expensive and CPU-intensive TCP/IP stack for the host in order
to perform FTP file transfers. The AFTP feature is based on IBM source
code that Microsoft recently licensed as part of the APPC Application Suite
from IBM.
<P>
The AFTP Client and Server programs will be installed automatically during
setup of an SNA Server version 2.11 client or server on a computer running
Windows NT version 3.5x. SNA Server AFTP Client will work on a Windows NT
client or server as a command-line utility, which can be used to create
batch jobs. SNA Server AFTP Server is a Windows NT service that will allow
AFTP clients to initiate file transfer (for example, from a host computer).
AFTP provides generic filename mapping support for consistency between
different operating systems' file systems.
<P>
For information on AFTP availability for other IBM platforms including host
systems and the AS/400, contact IBM directly, and/or contact IBM through
IBM's APPC compuserve forum (or "GO APPC" on Compuserve).
<P>
<P><h3>Demo Host Facility</h3>
 
<P>
This new software feature, included with SNA Server 2.11, allows resellers,
trainers, consultants, and customers to evaluate and demonstrate nearly all
SNA Server features and capabilities without a live host connection or any
special hardware. Previously, resellers had to purchase expensive access
time from host service providers in order to train their own personnel on
the features of a given SNA gateway product, or had to purchase a separate
hardware-based host simulator at a significant cost. The demo host facility
included with SNA Server can act both as a mainframe host and an AS/400
host and exercises the core functionality of SNA Server, including 3270 and
5250 sessions with multiple host connections, in an identical fashion to
the live host environment.
<P>
For detailed information, see the "DEMO SDLC Link Service" section later in
this guide.
<P>
<P><h3>SNA Monitor</h3>
 
<P>
This new monitor, which is similar to the monitor in Remote Access Service,
can be used to monitor the status of an SDLC connection. The SNA Server
2.11 Setup program will create an icon for this utility in the Microsoft
SNA Server program group. From the SNA Monitor Setting menu, you can
specify options such as sound, update interval, and which link service to
monitor.
<P>
<P><h3>Default APPC LUs</h3>
 
<P>
SNA Server 2.11 will create default Local and Remote APPC LUs. During Setup
of an SNA Server 2.11, a Local APPC LU will be created on the server node
with suggested default values. When you configure a new link service, if
the connection is configured as a peer connection, and if a remote APPC LU
is not detected, the New APPC Remote LU Properties dialog box will appear
with suggested default values when the OK button is chosen. Remember to
change the default values if they do not match your needs.
<P>
<P><h3>Planning Guide</h3>
 
<P>
A new document, called the SNA Server Planning Guide, is provided at no
charge with SNA Server version 2.11. This document contains information to
help resellers and users implement SNA Server in existing networks such as
NetWare, Banyan and TCP/IP environments. Among the topics covered are
server sizing recommendations for CPU types, and memory for various usage
patterns, preinstallation guidelines, enterprise rollout information, and
maintenance and troubleshooting tips collected from current users of SNA
Server.
<P>
<P><h3>Concurrent Licensing Option</h3>
 
<P>
Customers will continue to be able to license SNA Server on a per-client
and per-server basis, which allows any client to access any SNA Server on
the network. This is the most affordable licensing option when deploying
multiple SNA Servers for extra capacity, load balancing and hot backup,
because each extra server only costs approximately $409. SNA Server 2.11
adds the option to license SNA Server for concurrent use, which the user
can choose at the time of installation. With this option, customers are
required to purchase only as many client licenses as there are simultaneous
users accessing a given SNA Server. This option is suitable for single-
server installations or when only infrequent access to the host resources
is required. Licensing is a Windows NT Server-only application located in
Control Panel. Licensing allows you to manage licensing for Microsoft
server products installed on your networks.
<P>
The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
