The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The SNA Server 2.11 readme file includes the following section, though
the alternate DLL files mentioned are not included on the 2.11 product CD:
<P>
<PRE>   C.4. EHNAPPC.DLL Compatibility with Attachmate RALLY! and PC Support

   IBM PC Support and Attachmate RALLY! are examples of applications that
   depend on the static ordinal numbering of entry points in EHNAPPC.DLL.
   Various vendors' implementations of EHNAPPC.DLL differ in this static
   numbering, and many applications use dynamic linking by entry point name
   to avoid this problem.

   The version installed by default with the SNA Client is compatible
   with IBM CA/400. However, this version is not compatible with RALLY!,
   and will cause this application to fail via general protection failure
   or a pop-up message with the text "Assertion failed." SNA Server
   provides alternate versions of EHNAPPC.DLL and EHNRTRW.DLL which are
   compatible with the NetSoft EHNAPPC.DLL, for use with these
   applications.

   The alternate DLLs are found in the CD-ROM directory
   \CLIENTS\WIN3X\EHNNS\ and must be copied into the Windows system
   directory if you encounter this error.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The alternate DLL files were inadvertently left off the SNA Server 2.11 CD.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The alternate DLL files can be found in Rally.zip, located on the following
electronic locations:

<UL><LI>FTP.MICROSOFT.COM, in \bussys\winnt\sna-public\rally.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT.
This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
