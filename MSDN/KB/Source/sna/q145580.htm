The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.11 w/ Service Pack 1 and
   3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Link Services marked as Distributed (indicated in SNA Server Setup by
having a [D] before the link service) are started when SNABASE is started.
These link services are then available to be used as a remote (Proxy) link
service by other SNA Servers using the Distributed Link Service (DLS).
Starting the SNA Server service on the server acting as the proxy is not
needed.
<P>
NOTE: In SNA Server 3.0, link services that are distributed in 3.0 do not
have a (D) by them in Manager.  To tell if the link service is distributed,
check the Link Service Properties.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Link services not marked as distributed are started by the SNA Server
Service and used locally by SNA Server service. With the new Distributed
Link Service the SNA Server service uses the link service running on a
remote SNA Server. This remote machine acts as a proxy, providing the
connectivity to a host.
<P>
For more information about Distributed Link Service, see READMESP.WRI and
\COLLATRL\PRESS\SOGAPR.DOC on the SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 CD-ROM.
For SNA Server 3.0 check the Administration Guide or on-line help file,
Part 2 Managing SNA Server, What is a Distributed Link Service ?
