<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and
   2.11.sp1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the SNA Server client software configured to use the Novell
NetWare IPX/SPX client interface on Token Ring, the client is unable to
find a SNA Server located across an FDDI transitional bridge.
<P>
When the problem occurs on a SNA Server Microsoft Windows 3.x client,
Wnap.exe will display the following error when it is started:
<P>
<PRE>   SNA Server Error: 546  Cannot establish connection with SNA Server
   &lt;servername&gt;.

</PRE>Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft Windows 95 clients will indicate that
the SnaBase service is not started.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you connect a SNA Server IPX/SPX client from a Token Ring network to
a SNA Server located on FDDI, the intervening FDDI bridge may bit-swap the
destination address of the IPX/SPX connection request, causing the SNA
client to fail to connect to the SNA Server.
<P>
This problem only occurs when SNA Server clients are configured to use
NetWare IPX/SPX on Token Ring, where the server's IPX address is based on
the network card adapter address installed in the SNA Server.
<P>
Ethernet-attached IPX clients will not encounter this problem because the
FDDI bridge does not bit-flip destination addresses when bridging frames.
Also, all other client-server connection methods supported by SNA Server
(for example, named pipes, TCP/IP sockets, Banyan IP, and AppleTalk) do not
directly refer to the server's adapter address when it connects to the
server and will not encounter this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To support this configuration, an update to the SNA Server client software
is available that supports "bit flipping" of the SNA Server's IPX address.
It will try if the following new SNA Server client setting is enabled:
<P>
<PRE>   FlipMacAddress=Yes

</PRE>For Windows 3.x clients, this setting must be added to the [WNAP] section
of the Win.ini file.
<P>
For Windows NT clients, this settings must be set as follows:
<P>
<PRE>  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/SnaBase/
   Parameters/SnaSpx/

   FlipMacAddress: REG_SZ: Yes

</PRE>For Windows 95 clients, this setting must be set as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/SnaBase/Parameters/SnaSpx/

   FlipMacAddress: REG_SZ: Yes

</PRE>If this value is set to Yes, the SNA Server client NetWare transport first
tries the bit flipped server address, and if it fails, it retries with the
original non-flipped address.
<P>
For additional information on the algorithm for bit-flipping network
addresses, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   TITLE     : SNA Server Remote Station Discovery Process

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 2.0, 2.1, 2.11,
and 2.11.sp1.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
