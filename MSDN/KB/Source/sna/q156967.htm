<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11
   Service Pack 1, and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run an LUA application (or 3270 application that uses the LUA
flavor of the SNA Server 3270 Emulator Interface Specification), SNA Server
performance may degrade if the application is receiving a large number of
frames and SNA exception response protocol is being used on the session.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur if exception response protocol is used on an LU type
0, 1, 2, or 3 session, and the application does not periodically send
"courtesy acknowledgments" to SNA Server, as documented in the SNA
Considerations section in Chapter 2 of the SNA Server “LUA Programmer's
Guide” (included below).
<P>
If an LUA application developer encounters this problem, the application
should issue "courtesy acknowledgments" periodically (say, after every 10
frames received or so), as described below.
<P>
If a customer suspects a problem in this area, see the information below
for instructions on generating SNA Server traces to provide to the LUA
application developer or to SNA Server support personnel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Chapter 2 of the SNA Server “LUA Programmer's Guide” includes the following
information regarding "courtesy acknowledgments":
<P>
"SNA Server keeps a record of requests received from the host in order to
correlate any response sent by the application with the appropriate
request. When the application sends a response, SNA Server correlates the
response with the data from the original request, and can then free the
storage associated with it.
<P>
If the host specifies exception response only (a negative response may be
sent but a positive response should not be sent), SNA Server must still
keep a record of the request in case the application subsequently sends a
negative response. If the application does not send a response, the storage
associated with this request cannot be freed.
<P>
Because of this, SNA Server allows the LUA application to issue a positive
response to an exception-response-only request from the host (this is known
as a courtesy acknowledgment). The response is not sent to the host, but
is used by LUA to clear the storage associated with the request."
<P>
If the LUA application does not issue courtesy acknowledgments in this
scenario, the following behavior may be observed using Microsoft Windows NT
Performance Monitor utility:

<UL><LI>The "private bytes" memory counter for the SNASERVR.EXE process will
   steadily increase while the LUA application receives data.

<LI>Processor CPU usage may steadily increase

<LI>Data throughput on the LUA session will decrease
<P>
</UL>Also, if SNA Server tracing is enabled, the SNA Server may encounter
unexpected delays up to 45 seconds before responding to client requests.
<P>
To determine if this problem is occurring, the following traces should be
captured and provided to the LUA application developer, or to SNA Server
support personnel:

<UL><LI>Stop the LUA application

<LI>Run SNATRACE, focus on the SNA Server service and turn on Data Link
   Control (DLC) and 3270 message tracing, set the trace file size to
   a large value (say, 5000000 or 5 MB) and select Apply.

<LI>Start the LUA application and run a sample transaction.

<LI>Return to SNATRACE and select Clear All. The resulting trace files can
</UL>be found in &lt;Snaroot&gt;\System\Nodemsg?.trc.
<P>
To send a courtesy acknowledgment, the LUA application should write a
response containing a zero-length data message, setting the RH to indicate
a response and by setting the TH to have the sequence number (SNF) of the
RECEIVE verb that is being acknowledged. A SLI_SEND or RUI_WRITE indicates
a response if it has the response bit set in the RH in the verb control
block. The bits to set are:
<P>
<PRE>   lua_rh.rri = 1 /* response */
   lua_rh.ri =  0 /* positive response*/

</PRE>Also, if you use an SLI application, the lua_message_type in the SLI_SEND
command must be set to indicate a response (LUA_MESSAGE_TYPE_RSP). This is
described in Chapter 4 of the “LUA Programmer's Reference.”
