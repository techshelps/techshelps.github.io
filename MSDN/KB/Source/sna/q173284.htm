The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to identify the version of SNA Server or
SNA Server client software that is being used. Windows NT version 
dependencies are also described below. 
<P>
All releases of SNA Server include the &lt;snaroot&gt;\system\Snaver.exe 
utility which displays an internal version number within every 32-bit 
SNA Server DLL or EXE module. Besides Snaver, or the module file dates, 
the following information can also be used to determine the SNA Server 
version:

<UL><LI>From SNA Server Admin (or SNA Server Manager), click About on the
   Help menu.
<P>
   WARNING: When running SNA Server 2.11 Admin on Windows NT 4.0, this
   displays "Beta Version 2.0.0" in error.

<LI>Examine the following registry key on the SNA Server:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/SNA Server/
      CurrentVersion/SnaVersion: REG_SZ: &lt;version&gt;
</PRE><P>
   The &lt;version&gt; will indicate the major version and service pack level.  
   For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>       2.11 Service Pack 2
       3.0 Service Pack 1
</PRE><P>
</UL>NOTE: Starting with SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2), the Snaver.exe
program will display the SnaVersion registry key also, to indicate the
service pack level that has been applied. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft SNA Server
   Retail Version: 3.0 Service Pack 2

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Snaver.exe program can be used to display the internal build 
number of any SNA Server Win32 DLL or EXE module. When starting 
Snaver, it also displays a version number itself, which are listed 
below. 
<P>
NOTE: The modules updated in each service pack will not display a 
uniform internal build number. Service pack modules are built 
incrementally. To determine the SNA Server version based on the 
internal build number, only the Snaver.exe *or* Snadmod.dll build 
numbers should be viewed, as described below. 
<P>
The following table can be used to identify the version of SNA Server
being used. The following versions of SNA Server have been released as 
of this writing:
<P>
<PRE>   SNA SERVER     SNAVER.EXE
   VERSION        BUILD NUMBER   DATE OF BINARIES		
   ----------     ------------   ----------------------------------
   SNA 2.0        2.0.0.127      10/24/93
   SNA 2.10       2.1.0.267      9/3/94
   SNA 2.11       2.11.0.294     6/95 (NOTE 1)
   SNA 2.11 SP1   2.11.0.309     1/5/96 (NOTE 1, NOTE 2, NOTE 5)
   SNA 2.11 SP2   2.11.0.315     2/21/97 (NOTE 1, NOTE 4)
   SNA 3.0        3.0.0.414      11/17/96 
   SNA 3.0 SP1    3.0.0.433      4/9/97 (NOTE 3)
   SNA 3.0 SP2    3.0.0.462      9/30/97
   
</PRE>NOTE 1: If SNA Server 2.11 is running on Windows NT 4.0, the SNA Server 
<PRE>        Admin Help/About dialog incorrectly shows the SNA Server version 
        as "Beta Version 2.0.0". To determine the actual SNA Server 
        version, Snaver.exe should be run instead.
   
</PRE>NOTE 2: SNA Server 2.11 was refreshed when 2.11 SP1 was released.  
<PRE>        Customers purchasing SNA Server 2.11 after January 1996 should 
        have received the 2.11 SP1 version.

</PRE>NOTE 3: SNA Server 3.0 was refreshed when 3.0 SP1 was released. Customers 
<PRE>        purchasing SNA Server 3.0 after April 1997 should have received 
        the 3.0 SP1 version.

</PRE>NOTE 4: SNA Server 2.11 SP2 did not update the Snaver.exe program, so the
<PRE>        internal build number will be unchanged. To determine if 2.11 SP2
        has been applied to the server, use Snaver to view the build number
        of the &lt;snaroot&gt;\system\Snadmod.dllL file, which will be 2.11.0.315.

</PRE>NOTE 5: The initial version of the SNA Server Windows 95 client software 
<PRE>        was made available electronically by Microsoft on ftp.microsoft.com 
        during December 1995. This version had several problems which caused 
        tcp/ip session drops, which were fixed in the SNA Windows 95 client 
        included in 2.11 SP1. The initial release of SNA Server 2.11 did not 
        include an SNA Windows 95 client since the 2.11 release predated the 
        Windows 95 general release in August 1995.

</PRE><h2>SNA Server and Windows NT version dependencies</h2>
 
SNA Server 2.0 - Server runs on Windows NT 3.1. SNA Server 2.0 hotfixes were 
required to run on Windows NT 3.5. This version is longer supported by

<P>

longer supported by Microsoft
<P>
SNA Server 2.11 - Server requires Windows NT 3.5 or greater (does not run on 
3.1)
<P>
