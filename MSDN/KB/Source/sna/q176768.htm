The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When Microsoft SNA Server is configured with one or more channel
connections over the Polaris Escon channel adapter, not all of the PUs and
LUs reactivate if VTAM is shut down quickly using the VTAM command:
<P>
<PRE>   z net, cancel

</PRE>If VTAM is shut down in an orderly manner, the PUs and LUs do reactivate
properly.
<P>
This problem was observed when SNA Server was configured with 15 PUs and
250 LUs each (3750 total LUs). Some LUs failed to reactivate when VTAM
was restarted.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two different problems contributing to the reactivation
problems:

<UL><LI>SNA Server is not efficiently processing a large number of DACTLU
   messages from the host, causing slow performance in responding to DACTLU
   requests. This may cause the host to experience channel timeout errors
   during LU deactivation. This problem was fixed in SNA Server 3.0
   Service Pack 2 (SP2), though was not listed in the 3.0 SP2 fix list Help
   file.

<LI>The Polaris link service is not responding quickly to SNA Server
   Close(Link) requests, causing the host to experience channel errors when
   attempting to reactivate the PUs and LUs when the host was brought back
   up again.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Stop VTAM using an orderly shutdown method, instead of using the "z net,
   cancel" option.
<P>
   -OR-

<LI>Try disabling the channel PUs first
<P>
<P><PRE>      v net, id=xxxx,inact,f
</PRE><P>
   before issuing the "z net, cancel ..." command.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the SNA Server version 3.0,
3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and 3.0 SP2.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With this fix applied, SNA Server 3.0 was successfully tested with 15,000
LUs (the maximum LU capacity supported by SNA Server 3.0) over a single
Polaris ESCON adapter (60 PUs, each with 250 LUs).
<P>
The fix described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article should
also be applied when using SNA Server with thousands of 3270 or LUA LUs:

               LUs
