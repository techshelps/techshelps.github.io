The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 and 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1)
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to establish an SNARAS connection to an SNARAS server that
is heavily loaded over a LAN, the SNARAS client may fail and receive an
error message 629:
<P>
<PRE>   Port was disconnected by remote machine.

</PRE>At this point you have the option to cancel or retry. If you click Retry,
after about 5 seconds, there is an error message concerning Windows NT RAS
Error 651:
<P>
<PRE>   Your modem or other device-connecting device has reported an error.

</PRE>Subsequent attempts by the SNARAS client to establish a connection to the
SNARAS server will fail with Windows NT RAS error 651.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
SNARAS has two external interfaces: one to AsyncMac and one to APPC. The
APPC side of the SNARAS server detects an incoming client and commences the
initialization of the AsyncMac side (including creation of a port connected
to the AsyncMac device driver). The AsyncMac connection setup is multiphase
and, on a heavily loaded server, data arrives from the APPC side
before the AsyncMac port initialization has completed. Forwarding this
data across the SRI (interface from APPC to SNARAS) and attempting to send
it on to AsyncMac fails because the AsyncMac port initialization is not yet
complete.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Apply the fix referenced below. The updated modules are Snaras.dll and
Rassna.dll.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server, versions 2.11
and 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1).
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
The fix is already included in SNA Server 3.0. Unless you are severely
impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for
the next service pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information.
