The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT versions 2.11 Service Pack 1 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The distributed link service is a feature added in Service Pack 1 for
Microsoft SNA Server version 2.11 that allows SNA Servers to be deployed in
a new distributed model, which combines the benefits of the branch and
central models of deployment. For details on the distributed model and link
service, please see the SNA Open Gateway Architecture (SOGA) document.
<P>
Information on SOGA can be found in the following locations:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/corpinfo/press/1995/95dec/sogapr.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/corpinfo/press/1995/95dec/sogapr.htm</A></B>
   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/sna/soga.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/sna/soga.htm</A></B>

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The original SOGA document indicated that a distributed link service could
not be used by multiple SNA Servers simultaneously. The intent of this was
to prevent you from trying to configure a distributed link service on the
local SNA Server for a local connection. A distributed link service can
only be used by remote SNA Servers. However, it is possible to have
multiple remote systems using a single distributed link service.
<P>
To do this, each remote system must be assigned a unique Service Access
Point (SAP). SNA SAPs must be a hexadecimal multiple of four and must be
defined on both ends of the connection. Assuming you had three remote
systems you intended to use the distributed link service, you would use
SAPs '04', '08', and '0C'.
<P>
The SAPs are defined in the communications line description on the AS/400.
Your AS/400 administrator can help you with this. Using the example of
three systems, you would add '08' and '0C' to the SAPs already defined on
the line. SAP '04' is defined by default.
<P>
To set the appropriate SAPs do the following:
<P>
For SNA Server 2.x:
<P>
- In SNA Server Admin, focus on the Connection, then select the Setup
button, and then select the Advanced button.  Change the Remote SAP Address
to the value you have assigned to that computer.  Again, from the three
computers example, '04' for the first computer, '08' for the second, and
<PRE>'0C' for
</PRE>the third."
<P>
For SNA Server 3.x:
<P>
- In SNA Server Manager, go to the connection properties page for the
connection in question and select the Address tab.
