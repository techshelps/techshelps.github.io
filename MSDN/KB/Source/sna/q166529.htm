The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
APPC applications and 5250 emulators may appear to hang when trying to 
connect to a SNA Server, version 3.0 (including all SPs) or 4.0 system.
<P>
<P>
APPC applications and 5250 emulators may appear to hang when trying to 
connect to a SNA Server, version 3.0 or 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) system.
<P>
After starting a 5250 session and entering an AS/400 Userid and Password
in the AS/400 logon dialogue, the 5250 session will continue to display 
a blank screen and will not display the AS/400 signon screen. The 
session may eventually display an error similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not connect to remote host.

   [0003][0000005]

</PRE>This is the error that was displayed when using the 5250 Applet that is 
included with SNA Server when QPCSUPP was configured as the Implicit 
Incoming Mode in SNA Server Manager. It took several minutes before the 
error was displayed. The error message may be different depending on the 
emulator that is being used.
<P>
For other APPC applications, a SNA Server LU 6.2 Message trace may show 
that the SNA Server nevers responds to the "Open LU62 Request" that it 
receives from the APPC DLL on the client running the application.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused if the Remote APPC LU defined in SNA Server 3.0 
is configured to use an Implicit Incoming Mode that matches the APPC 
Mode that the application will be using. For example, the problem would 
occur if the Implicit Incoming Mode was set to APPCMODE and the APPC 
application was defined to use this mode.
<P>
The Implicit Incoming Mode is configured on the Options tab of the 
Remote APPC LU's property page in SNA Server Manager.  
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An Implicit Incoming Mode is used to define the properties to use when 
SNA Server receives a request to start an APPC session when an incoming 
APPC Allocate specifies a null Mode name or if the specified Mode name 
is not recognized by SNA Server.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The workaround is to change the Implicit Incoming Mode setting for 
Remote APPC LUs to either &lt;None&gt; or to a Mode name that the APPC/5250 
applications are not actually using.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0, 
3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will 
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes 
available.
