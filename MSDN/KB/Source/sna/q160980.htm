The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and 2.11 SP1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An SNA Server Twinax connection, after being active, will go into a
"Pending" status in the SNA Server Administrator program. When this occurs,
Event ID 23, Qualifier 11, is logged to the Application Event log. This can
occur with both the Andrew and IBM Twinax Link services.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem is associated with a block of data inbound to the AS/400, which
has a length of 1025 decimal. The Twinax line protocol has a maximum
read/write length of 1024. This means the AS/400 asks for a block of 1024
characters and then a block of one character. It does the one-character
block by setting the Address Counter Register and the Reference Counter
Register to the same location and then performing a Read Between Limits
Command. This should result in a one-character block being sent out on the
Twinax line.
<P>
However, there is an incorrect register, which results in the Twinax Link
service returning an error to the AS/400 of "Invalid Register Value." This
causes the AS/400 to reset the Twinax line, which causes the outage.
<P>
This error occurs in both the Andrew and the IBM driver supplied with SNA
Server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Apply the fix referenced below. The fix is made to a routine called
"DTPDCmdReadBetwLimits," which does the correct math locally to send the
one-byte message instead of the invalid register value.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0,
2.1, 2.11, and 2.11 SP1.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
