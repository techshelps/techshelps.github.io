The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft SNA Server Manager starts in a minimized state in the 
following scenarios:
<P>
- Manager is minimized on the Windows NT 4.0 Task Bar and cannot be
<PRE>  restored, sized, or maximized.

</PRE>- Manager is shown as a title bar somewhere on the desktop. It can be
<PRE>  resized by dragging one of the edges of the minimized window.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
SNA Server Manager can get into this minimized state if it is started 
after one of more of the SNA Server services fail to start. Typically, 
the SNA MngAgent or the SnaBase service are the services that failed 
to start when this problem occurs.
<P>
Note: The Windows NT System Log should contain Service Control Manager 
errors that indicate why the SNA Server services failed to start.
<P>
SNA Server Manager stores information about its window state in a file 
called SNAEXP.SNAV. This file contains information regarding the size 
and position of the main SNA Server Manager window, as well as which 
part of a subdomain is displayed in each multiple document interface 
(MDI) window and the size and position of the MDI windows. When SNA 
Server Manager is started, it reads the information in this file and 
restores the window state recorded in the SNAEXP.SNAV file.
<P>
The problem occurs because Manager gets out of sync when reading the 
SNAEXP.SNAV file when the SNA Server services do not start properly.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps will resolve the issue:

<OL><P><LI>Close SNA Server Manager if it is running.
</OL>2. Delete the SNAEXP.SNAV file in the &lt;snaroot&gt;\system directory.
3. Make sure that the SNA MngAgent service is started.
4. Start SNA Server manager.
<P>
SNA Server Manager has been updated so that is always reads the 
SNAEXP.SNAV file in a normal order to prevent it from getting out 
of sync.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server, 
version 3.0.
<P>
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific 
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, 
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that 
contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more 
information.
