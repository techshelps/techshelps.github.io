<UL><LI>Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) 5.0 Software Development Kit (SDK),

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is now licensing its Visual Basic for Applications 5.0 (VBA)
technology to 3rd-party developers. This article covers some of the most
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about VBA and how you can integrate it
into your own application. Information about how to license VBA technology
is also provided.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. What is VBA?

</PRE>A. Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is a powerful visual
programming environment that is seamlessly integrated into another program,
known as a "host". With VBA, users can easily extend or customize the
behavior of the host by writing code using the popular Visual Basic
programming language.
<P>
The new Visual Basic code is contained in a Project, which is compiled and
saved along with the application's data file. The Project essentially
becomes an integral part of the host whenever that file is opened.
<P>
For example, the major Microsoft Office 97 applications are hosts for VBA.
VBA lets you customize what happens when a user opens an Excel worksheet,
or when a button on a form in a Word 97 document is clicked. Complex, cross-
application, enterprise-wide solutions can be created using the power of
VBA.
<P>
The VBA programming environment offers the same amenities as the Visual
Basic 5.0 user interface. Although it exists outside the host's application
window, the IDE runs in the same memory space as the host. This means
tighter integration for event handling, code execution, and better
performance.
<P>
VBA's visual programming environment also provides the following:

<UL><LI>Enhanced code editor with syntax checking, color-coded syntax, and
   support for code drag-and-drop
<LI>Project Explorer for navigating open projects and their components
<LI>Properties window for setting and viewing object properties
<LI>New debugging tools to track program execution and locate bugs
<LI>Object Browser for browsing and searching for properties and methods
   across object model libraries
<LI>IntelliSense features for instant syntax reference and object model
   assistance to reduce programming time
<LI>Code security with improved password protection and encryption to lock
   both documents and projects
<LI>Conditional compilation so you can include debugging code that will not
   execute in the final version of your application

<PRE>2. Q. What platforms are supported?

</PRE></UL>A. Versions of VBA are planned for the following 32-bit platforms:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows® 95 and Windows NT on Intel platforms
<LI>Alpha RISC platforms
<LI>Macintosh/PowerPC
<P>
</UL>VBA is not supported on UNIX or 16-bit platforms.

<PRE>3. Q. What languages are supported?

</PRE>A. The following localized versions of VBA are available or planned:

<UL><LI>Chinese (Traditional Characters)
<LI>Chinese (Simplified Characters)
<LI>Czech
<LI>Danish
<LI>Dutch
<LI>English
<LI>Finnish
<LI>French
<LI>German
<LI>Greek
<LI>Hungarian*
<LI>Italian
<LI>Japanese
<LI>Korean
<LI>Norwegian
<LI>Portuguese
<LI>Brazilian Portuguese
<LI>Polish*
<LI>Russian*
<LI>Slovenian*
<LI>Spanish
<LI>Swedish
<LI>Turkish*
<LI>Arabic (to be determined)
<LI>Hebrew (to be determined)
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Help files will not be localized for languages marked with * above.
In those cases, only the VBA programming interface will be localized.

<PRE>4. Q. Is there support for multi-threading?

</PRE>A. VBA does not support multi-threading. It can, however, be used in
applications that are multi-threaded, provided that VBA is initialized and
accessed only from the main UI thread.

<PRE>5. Q. What about the Mac?

</PRE>A. A version of VBA is currently planned for the Power-Mac PowerPC.

<PRE>6. Q. How is VBA related to Visual Basic 5.0? To VBScript?

</PRE>A. Visual Basic 5.0 is a powerful programming tool for generating new
applications and ActiveX controls. Although VBA includes the same visual
programming environment as Visual Basic 5.0, it does not support creating
separate programs; instead, VBA allows users to extend the application that
is hosting it.
<P>
VBScript is a simple ActiveX Script engine that interprets and executes a
subset of the Visual Basic language. The code for such scripts exists
outside the application, whereas VBA code is part of a compiled Project
that is tightly integrated with its host. In addition, VBScript offers no
integrated development environment.
<P>
You should carefully consider your needs when deciding whether to host
VBScript or VBA. Integrating VBA is considerably more difficult than adding
VBScript capabilities to your code.
<P>
For more information about VBScript, visit the VBScript home page on the
Microsoft web site:

7. Q. How do I integrate VBA5 into my application?

</PRE>A. Integration involves intensive work with C/C++ and COM programming. To
assist developers with this process, Microsoft provides the Visual Basic
for Applications 5.0 Software Development Kit (VBA5 SDK). It contains
required software libraries, source files, and DLLs, a test kit, re-
distributable files, a Failsafe Install program, and API documentation and
integration guides. An included sample, TTHost, walks developers through
the various steps required to successfully integrate VBA into a host
application.

<PRE>8. Q. How can I obtain the VBA5 SDK?

</PRE>A. Microsoft has authorized two sales agents, Mystic River Software and
Summit Software Company, to handle the licensing and technical support for
all 3rd-party developers. The VBA5 SDK is available only through these
sales agents. See the "References" section below for addresses and phone
numbers.

<PRE>9. Q. Do I have to install Office 97 so that my host application will work?

</PRE>A. Office 97 is not required on development or user machines in order for
your host application to run. When you install your application, you
install all the necessary VBA files. The special Failsafe Install dll,
included in the VBA5 SDK, is flexible enough to be used by your own setup
program to ensure proper installation and avoid conflicts with other host
applications.
<P>
If Office 97 is installed, however, your host will work with the those
applications, as well as any other 3rd-party applications that host VBA,
the same way they work with each other. This gives your application the
added flexibility of working independently or as part of an Office 97
solution.

<PRE>10. Q. Where do my developers get technical support during the integration
</PRE>effort?
<P>
A. Technical support for 3rd-party developers is offered in accordance with
the provisions of your license agreement with your sales agent. Please
refer questions about the nature and scope of that support to them.

<PRE>11. Q. Where do my users get technical support for writing their Visual
</PRE>Basic code?
<P>
A. A complete set of VBA reference help files are included with the VBA5
SDK. The Failsafe Install program automatically installs them on your
user's machines during setup. The VBA5 SDK also includes a set of printable
documentation you may want to distribute with your application.
<P>
In addition, there are many sources of help available for users writing
Visual Basic code. Visit the following web sites and newsgroups for more
information:

12. Q. Is there a logo program?

</PRE>A. You can place the "Featuring Microsoft Visual Basic Technology" logo on
marketing materials for any application that earn it. For more information
on the VBA Logo program, visit the Microsoft web site listed in the
