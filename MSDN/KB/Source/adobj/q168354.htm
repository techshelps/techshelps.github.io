<UL><LI>ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)  to be used from:
</UL> 
<P>
-  Microsoft Active Server Pages, versions 1.0, 1.0b
<PRE>  -  Microsoft Transaction Server 1.0
  -  Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.2, 5.0
  -  Microsoft Visual InterDev, version 1.0

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) processes errors by raising them, if possible,
into the Errors Collection. The Errors Collection contains one Error object
for each error ADO was able to process from it's underlying provider. Often
the value for these errors is a numeric HRESULT raised by a provider such
as OLE-DB or even OLE itself. Because of these underlying components, they
and their HRESULTS are not documented within the ADO online documentation.
<P>
This article presents a list of HRESULTS that may be raised to ADO from the
more common sources.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Two values, One HRESULT</h3>
 
<P>
Depending upon the development environment, and the mechanism used to trap
error conditions, you may see HRESULTS in one of two forms:
<P>
<PRE>   0x80004005  (hex)
   -2147467259 (long)

</PRE>They are the same value, just cast differently. In this case they are the
E_FAIL value, which may indicate that neither OLE-DB nor it's underlying
provider was able to positively identify the source of the error.
<P>
<P><h3>Frequently Encountered HRESULTS from OLE</h3>
 
<P>
This list was compiled from the Winerror.h file, which ships with the Win32
SDK. This list is actually a sub-set of a much more complete set of OLE
errors. However, this is the set this most likely to be raised by OLE or
OLE-DB to ADO.

</PRE><h3>Debugging HRESULTS from OLE-DB</h3>
 
<P>
Some OLE-DB error messages, such as 80040e37 (Table 'x' does not exist) are
fairly obvious whether using ADO or OLE-DB. Others such as 0x80040E06
(Invalid chapter) are not as clear to an ADO developer.  You can use the
ITest/ISpy tools that ship with the OLE-DB SDK to spy on the OLE-DB calls.
ITest/ISpy are simliar to ODBC Spy and you can use them for complex
debugging in ADO/DB applications.
<P>
This list was compiled from the Oledberr.h file, which ships with the
OLE-DB SDK:
