<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following error occurs when accessing a recordset in an Active Server
Pages (ASP) file that contains "Text" or "Blob" type data from a SQL table:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80020009'

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The following condition may cause the error to occur: Text/Blob fields are
selected in an order preceding other types of fields.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When dealing with BLOB fields from SQL Server, you need to put them to the
right of non-BLOB columns in the resultset. To be safe, you should also
read the columns in left-to-right order, so if you have two BLOB columns as
the last two columns in your resultset, read the first one and then the
second. Do not read them in the reverse order.
<P>
The code example below demonstrates the correct order of field selection:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;HTML&gt;
   &lt;BODY bgcolor=white&gt;
   &lt;%
      Set cn = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
      Set rs = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset")

      'open the connection
      cn.Open "&lt;Put your DSN here&gt;"

      'open the recordset

</PRE>Notice that the Blob field, pr_info, is last in the field order:
<P>
<PRE>      rs.Open "select pub_id, pr_info from pub_info", cn

      While Not rs.EOF

         Response.Write "&lt;P&gt;PR Info:&lt;P&gt;" &amp; rs("pr_info")
         Response.Write "&lt;P&gt;That was the PR Info for PubID " &amp; rs("pub_id")
            rs.MoveNext
      Wend
   %&gt;
   &lt;/BODY&gt;
   &lt;/HTML&gt;

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The reason for all of this is easily understood when you think about how
SQL Server is sending back the data on the wire. Your client is essentially
getting a stream of bits back and can read them sequentially off of the
network wire. When you have columns that can be bound (that is, the values
can be copied into local memory buffers and cached there), the driver can
transfer data in those columns into memory buffers pretty efficiently. Once
they are there, you can read them in any order you want. This is why you
can read result columns in any order when all the columns are bound (not
BLOBs).
<P>
However, when you include BLOB columns, the length of the column can be
huge and data access libraries will typically not bind those kinds of
columns since the driver will often not be able to tell exactly how big the
BLOB is until it's all read off the wire. Libraries will also typically
avoid caching the BLOB data since it can consume lots of memory and caching
it both in the library and your application is a waste.
<P>
So if you ask the driver to return the contents of a BLOB column, it will
typically throw away any non-bound columns that preceded the requested BLOB
column, since it has to read that data off the wire before it can start
reading the column you asked for. Therefore, it's always best to read from
left-to-right in your result set since that matches the way the data is
laid out on the wire.
<P>
Note that this is behavior of SQL Server. Oracle and other client/server
DBMSs will likely do the same thing, but it's not guaranteed.
<P>
Of course, the best thing of all is not to use a Text column. Doing so
causes the server to allocate column space in 2K chunks and that's a lot of
space to store something that may only be a few words (it also takes more
time to backup and dump the transaction log too). It's often better to
create another table that has the PK of your existing table, a chunk number
column, and a varchar(255) column. You break the text into as many 255
character chunks as is needed and insert as many rows in the new table as
there are chunks. If there is no text at all, don't insert any rows. It's a
bit more work (not much though) and you can save a lot of room, make your
backups go much faster and avoid lots of headaches that are inherently
caused by working with BLOB columns.
