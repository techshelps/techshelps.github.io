<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Scigraph demo when using Windows Large Fonts, only the
graph title and outline are displayed for each of the sample graphs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Before plotting a graph, the PlotGraph() function makes a call to the
SETFONT() graphics function using Windows Small Fonts - which have a height
of 11 pixels. On a computer running Windows Large Fonts, this is replaced
with a font that is 10 or 12 pixels high. Consequently, the call to
SETFONT() fails. PlotGraph() detects this and stops drawing the rest of the
graph.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Perform the following steps to run the Scigraph demo successfully on any
computer that has the Arial TrueType font installed. To accomplish this,
you must change the reference to Windows Small Fonts in the Sgdata.f90
source file by replacing the $FVSANSSERIFSM font value of t'Small
Fonts'h11w5 with t'Arial'h12w6.

<OL><P><LI>After copying all the Scigraph demo files to your computer, delete the
   source module (*.mod) files in the \Scigraph directory by using the File
   Manager in Windows NT or Explorer in Windows 95.

<P><LI>Open the Scigraph.mdp static library project file. On the Developer
   Studio File menu, click Open Workspace, and select the Scigraph.mdp
   project file located in the \Scigraph directory.

<P><LI>Open the Sgdata.f90 source file contained in the scigraph project. This
   is accessible through the Scigraph files list in the \Scigraph
   directory.

<P><LI>Replace the reference to Small Fonts by using Developer Studio's find
   and replace feature. On the Edit menu, click Replace. In the Find What
   box, type:
<P>
   "t'Small Fonts'h11w5"
<P>
   In the Replace With box, type:
<P>
   "t'Arial'h12w6"
<P>
   Then click the Replace button. After successfully changing the font
   reference, save the modified source file.

<P><LI>Rebuild the Scigraph.mdp project file by clicking Rebuild All on the
   Developer Studio Build menu.

<P><LI>Open the Sgdemo.mdp project file and remove the files Scigraph.lib and
   Sgdemo.f90. These files must be removed from the project because they
   contain old references to the module files.

<P><LI>Insert the new versions of the two files removed in step 6 back into the
   Sgdemo.mdp project file -- the newly created Scigraph.lib file built in
   step 5 located in either the \Debug or \Release project subdirectory and
   the Sgdemo.f90 source file located in the \Scigraph directory.

<P><LI>Rebuild the Sgdemo.mdp project file by click Rebuild All on the
   Developer Studio Build menu.

<P><LI>Run the Scigraph demo to display all the graph elements for each of the
   sample graphs.
