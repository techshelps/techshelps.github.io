The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FORTRAN for OS/2, versions 5.0 and 5.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Contrary to what is stated in the "Microsoft FORTRAN Getting Started"
booklet included with Microsoft FORTRAN version 5.0 and the
"Microsoft FORTRAN Installing and Using the Professional Development
System" booklet shipped with Microsoft FORTRAN version 5.1, SET
statements for environment variables should not be included in the
STARTUP.CMD file. These statements should be included in the
CONFIG.SYS file, an OS2INIT.CMD file, or in another .CMD file that
is executed before FORTRAN is used.
<P>
The FORTRAN version 4.10 manuals do not contain this documentation
error, but the information included below about setting up the
environment also applies to version 4.10.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Page 20 of the "Microsoft FORTRAN Getting Started" booklet included
with FORTRAN 5.0 states the following:
<P>
<PRE>   The environment-setting commands can be included in your
   AUTOEXEC.BAT or STARTUP.CMD file to ensure that the compiler
   environment is properly set up each time you reboot.

</PRE>Page 21 of the "Microsoft FORTRAN Installing and Using the
Professional Development System" booklet included with FORTRAN version
5.1 states the following:
<P>
<PRE>    If the host operating mode is OS/2, add the contents of the
    NEW-VARS.CMD file to your STARTUP.CMD file and the contents of
    NEW-CONF.SYS to CONFIG.SYS.

</PRE>This is correct for the MS-DOS AUTOEXEC.BAT file but not for the OS/2
STARTUP.CMD file. Both files are executed when a machine running their
respective systems is booted, but the environment variables set in
STARTUP.CMD are only recognized by the OS/2 screen group that executes
the .CMD file. If another OS/2 screen group is started, STARTUP.CMD is
not automatically executed and the environment set by it in the
original screen group does not affect the new screen group.
<P>
To ensure that the environment settings required by FORTRAN are set
under OS/2, the PATH, SET LIB, SET TMP, SET INIT, and SET INCLUDE
statements should be included in the CONFIG.SYS file, in an
OS2INIT.CMD file, or in a .CMD file that is executed before working
with FORTRAN.
<P>
Environment variables can be set in the CONFIG.SYS file for OS/2
versions 1.1 and later. The variables set there are recognized by
each OS/2 screen group. This feature is not available in version 1.00
of OS/2. In this case, an OS2INIT.CMD file can be used to set the
environment.
<P>
The OS2INIT.CMD file is the OS/2 equivalent to the MS-DOS AUTOEXEC.BAT in
terms of setting the environment for an OS/2 screen group. To use
OS2INIT.CMD, the /K option for CMD.EXE must be included in the
PROTSHELL statement of CONFIG.SYS.
<P>
For example:
<P>
<PRE>   PROTSHELL=... ... C:\0S2\CMD.EXE /K OS2INIT.CMD

</PRE>The file specified after the /K option is executed every time a new
screen group is started. Any name can be used for the .CMD file.
