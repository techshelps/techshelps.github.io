 1. Q. I am unable to link a program; I always receive the error
       message "Invalid Object Module." What is causing this problem?

    A. Check that you are using the correct version of the linker. For
       Microsoft FORTRAN version 5.1, you should have LINK.EXE version
       5.15; for FORTRAN version 5.0, you should have LINK.EXE version
       5.03. It is common to find an old version of LINK.EXE somewhere
       in your path. Check your DOS directory first. If you find an
       outdated LINK.EXE file in your DOS directory, rename it to
       something other than LINK.EXE or delete it.

 2. Q. When I compile and link from within Programmer's
       WorkBench, the error message "Cannot find file CORE.ASM" is
       displayed. When I link under Microsoft MS-DOS, I receive many
       L2029 unresolved external errors. What causes these errors?

    A. These errors can be caused by having a C-compatible FORTRAN
       run-time library. If you select C compatibility in the
       Microsoft FORTRAN Setup program, a substantial portion of the
       FORTRAN library is removed, which means that you must link with
       both the Microsoft C and the FORTRAN run-time libraries at all
       times. If you are not doing mixed-language programming with the
       Microsoft C Compiler, run the Setup program again, and choose
       the Load Or Build Additional Libraries option. Supply the
       necessary information and make sure that you choose No in
       response to the prompt "Install for compatibility with C?"

 3. Q. I have problems with Programmer's WorkBench loading and
       compiling incorrectly. How can I correct these problems?

    A. Make sure that you start the application with the command PWB
       and not PWBED. PWBED is the editor portion of the application
       only. Also, verify that your TMP and INIT environment variables
       are correctly set by typing "SET" (without the quotation marks)
       at the MS-DOS command line and then pressing ENTER. If the
       variables are set correctly, try to start Programmer's
       WorkBench again. If problems persist, verify that you have
       copied the file TOOLS.PRE to TOOLS.INI in the FORTRAN\INIT
       directory.

 4. Q. When I compile and link my FORTRAN source code using the
       Programmer's WorkBench application, the error messages "LINK:
       warning L4051 : LLIBF7R.LIB: cannot find library" and "LINK
       warning L4021: no stack segment" are displayed. How can I avoid
       these error messages?

    A. These error messages may be caused by failing to copy the file
       TOOLS.PRE to TOOLS.INI in the FORTRAN\INIT directory. Also,
       verify that the INIT environment variable is set to the
       directory containing the TOOLS.INI file. If you do not have a
       coprocessor, make sure that you select the correct floating-
       point option in Programmer's WorkBench. From the Options menu
       in Programmer's WorkBench, choose FORTRAN Compiler Options. At
       the bottom of the FORTRAN Compiler Options dialog box, select
       the Set Debug Options button or the Set Release Options button
       to bring up the next dialog box. In this dialog box, change the
       selected floating-point option to Inline Emulation.

 5. Q. I am receiving one of the following link error messages:
       "L2041 Stack Plus Data exceeds 64K," "L1070 Segment exceeds
       64K," or "L2002 Fixup Overflow." How can I avoid these error
       messages?

    A. You can prevent these errors by compiling with the /Gt option,
       which is documented in the "Microsoft FORTRAN Reference." If
       the errors still occur after you compile all your source code
       with the /Gt option, try recompiling with the /Gt3 option.

 6. Q. My program is behaving erratically and I receive a run-
       time error when I run my program. I want to determine the line
       number in the source code that is causing the error. How can I
       do this?

    A. Try compiling your program with the /4Yb debugging option. This
       option provides a line number of the source code that is
       causing the error, along with the run-time error message. The
       option also installs routines that check for array subscripts
       that go out of range and for other errors. The /4Yb debugging
       option is documented in the "Microsoft FORTRAN Reference."

 7. Q. When I try to build a Windows-based QuickWin application,
       I receive the linker error message "LINK: warning L4021: no
       stack segment." Or, when I try to run a QuickWin application,
       the error message "The specified application is not a Windows
       or MS-DOS application" is displayed. How can I correct these
       problems?

    A. These two problems are caused by not including the FL.DEF
       module-definitions file in the definition file field on the
       link command line or in the Programmer's WorkBench program
       list. FL.DEF is located in the FORTRAN\BINB directory.

 8. Q. I get the compiler error "F1901 program too large for
       memory during compile." How can I correct this problem?

    A. Try using the high-capacity compiler. To use the high-capacity
       compiler with FORTRAN 5.1, add the compiler option /B1 F1L.EXE
       on your FL command line. From the Options menu in Programmer's
       WorkBench, choose FORTRAN Compiler Options. On the Additional
       Options line, add /B1 F1L.EXE. Using FORTRAN 5.0, copy the file
       F1L.EXE from the high-capacity compiler disk shipped with
       FORTRAN 5.0 into your BIN directory. Then use the compiler
       option /B1 F1L.EXE.

 9. Q. When I create a Windows-based FORTRAN application from
       Programmer's WorkBench, the error message "Windows library not
       installed, Assume explicit library name?" is displayed. How can
       I correct this problem?

    A. You may not have installed your FORTRAN compiler for both
       MS-DOS and Windows targeting. In the FORTRAN 5.1 Setup program,
       you are prompted to select the target operating system. To
       install FORTRAN for Windows targeting, you must move the arrow
       key down to the DOS And Windows selection and press the
       SPACEBAR. This places an asterisk next to the selection. If you
       do not press the SPACEBAR and you do press the ENTER key,
       Windows targeting is not installed. Reinstall FORTRAN if
       necessary, and make sure that you press the SPACEBAR on all
       multiple-selection screens.

10. Q. My application compiled and linked without any errors. When I
       try to run my application under MS-DOS, either the error
       message "Cannot execute &lt;PROGRAM.EXE&gt;" (where &lt;PROGRAM.EXE&gt; is
       the name of my executable file) is displayed, or my machine
       hangs. My application is large and declares a large amount of
       data. How can I correct this problem?

    A. Make sure that the program is not larger than the amount of
       available conventional MS-DOS memory. Conventional MS-DOS
       memory cannot exceed 640K; extended memory is not available for
       standard MS-DOS-based applications. The size of the executable
       file provides a rough estimate of the application size.

       For FORTRAN version 5.1, use the EXEHDR utility to determine
       the amount of memory needed to run the program. Type "exehdr
       program.exe" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER. If
       you have FORTRAN 5.0, use the EXEMOD utility, rather than the
       EXEHDR utility. To determine the amount of available
       conventional MS-DOS memory, type "chkdsk" (without the
       quotation marks) and press ENTER. The last entry on the screen
       should read "&lt;x&gt; bytes free," where &lt;x&gt; is the amount of
       available conventional memory. Because Microsoft FORTRAN does
       not provide an MS-DOS extender, to access extended memory you
       must compile and link your code to run under a protected mode
       operating system. With FORTRAN version 5.0, you can compile and
       link to run under OS/2. With FORTRAN version 5.1, you can
       compile and link to run under either Windows or OS/2.
