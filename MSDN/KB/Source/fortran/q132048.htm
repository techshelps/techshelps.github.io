<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Visual Workbench included with:
   Fortran Powerstation for Windows, versions 1.0 and 1.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An attempt to use the Microsoft Visual Workbench fails and Visual Workbench
generates this message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot open the SYSTEM.INI file to test for the presence of the
   MMD.386 driver. Subsequent builds may fail.

</PRE>When you choose OK to close the message box, Visual Workbench generates
this message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Fortran PowerStation cannot be initialized.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows is installed in the root directory of a drive.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If Windows is physically installed in the root directory, move the
installation to a subdirectory. Reinstall Windows or manually move Windows
files to the new location. If you move the files manually, you must update
the AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, and various .INI files to reflect the new
location.
<P>
If the MS-DOS SUBST command was used to map a drive letter to the Windows
directory, disable the mapping and specify the fully-qualified path in the
MS-DOS PATH environment variable. Enter the following command at the MS-DOS
command prompt to delete a drive substitution:
<P>
<PRE>   SUBST &lt;drive_letter&gt;: /d

</PRE>Specify the drive letter mapping to delete in the &lt;drive_letter&gt; parameter.
<P>
If you use the Novell NetWare drive mapping facility to map the Windows
directory as the root directory of a drive, use the Novell MAP command to
delete the current mapping and create a new mapping to a directory other
than the root. For more information on using the Novell MAP command, please
see the "More Information" section of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Visual Workbench versions
1.0 and 1.0a for Windows. This problem was corrected in the Visual
Workbench version 1.5 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Visual Workbench cannot locate the SYSTEM.INI file when Windows is
installed in the root directory of a drive. The problem also occurs when
the MS-DOS SUBST command maps the Windows directory to the root directory
of a drive or when the Novell NetWare drive mapping mechanism maps the
Windows directory on a file server to the root directory of a drive.
<P>
Novell NetWare supports mapping drive letters to directories in the file
system. NetWare supports up to 26 drive mappings, assigned to the letters A
through Z. You can use up to 16 of the possible drive mappings for a
special type of mapping known as a search drive map.
<P>
Search drive mappings are similar to the MS-DOS PATH environment variable.
When the user enters a command, NetWare searches the current directory for
the command to execute. If the command is not available, NetWare searches
the directories that are specified as search drives in ascending order. In
other words, search drive 1 is searched first, followed by search drive 2,
and so on.
<P>
With the NetWare MAP utility, you can add, delete, and list current drive
mappings. For example, if you enter the MAP command at the MS-DOS command
prompt, the drive mapping utility displays something like this:
<P>
<PRE>   Drive  A:   maps to a local disk
   Drive  B:   maps to a local disk
   Drive  C:   maps to a local disk
   Drive  D:   maps to a local disk
   Drive  E:   maps to a local disk
   Drive  F: = SERVER_NAME\SYS:  \USER\USER_NAME
         -----
   SEARCH1:  = C:\DOS
   SEARCH2:  = Z:. [SERVER_NAME\SYS:  \PUBLIC]
   SEARCH3:  = Y:. [SERVER_NAME\SYS:  \MSVC\BIN]
   SEARCH4:  = X:. [SERVER_NAME\SYS:WINDOWS  \]

</PRE>The MAP utility provides a method to map a directory to a drive letter and
have that directory treated as the root directory for the drive letter. MAP
uses different methods to display drives that are mapped as root
directories and drives that are not mapped as root directories. For
example, in the MAP output shown above, the SEARCH4 mapping is a root
mapping; the other mappings are not root mappings. The backslash (\)
character at the end of the line indicates that SEARCH4 is a root mapping.
<P>
<PRE>   SEARCH4:  = X:. [SERVER_NAME\SYS:WINDOWS  \]
                                             ^------ denotes a root mapping

</PRE>Visual Workbench fails when it attempts to open the SYSTEM.INI file on a
drive that has a root mapping.
<P>
The MAP command can delete search drive mappings. For example, to delete
the SEARCH4 mapping above, enter the following at the MS-DOS command
prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   MAP DEL SEARCH4:

</PRE>To define a new, non-root drive mapping for the Windows directory, enter
the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   MAP SEARCH4:=SYS:\WINDOWS

</PRE>The SYS: portion of the command specifies the name of the Novell volume on
which the Windows directory is installed. Volumes are similar to MS-DOS
disk partitions (C:, D:, and so on). After you enter the two MAP commands
shown above, the sample MAP output is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   SEARCH1:  = C:\DOS
   SEARCH2:  = Z:. [SERVER_NAME\SYS:  \PUBLIC]
   SEARCH3:  = Y:. [SERVER_NAME\SYS:  \MSVC\BIN]
   SEARCH4:  = X:. [SERVER_NAME\SYS:  \WINDOWS]

</PRE>If you need to have the Windows directory mapped as a root directory (for
use by some other program, for example), you can create a non-search drive
mapping, and manually add it to the path. Non-search drive mappings are
drive mappings that are not searched by default when NetWare attempts to
locate a program to run. Non-search drive mappings are typically used to
quickly navigate through the file system. To create a non-search drive
mapping, enter the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   MAP G:=SYS:\WINDOWS

</PRE>The drive letter specified in the MAP command cannot conflict with any
mapping already in place. After the mapping is available, you can edit the
MS-DOS PATH environment variable to specify the new drive letter. To avoid
the difficulties that can occur when the Visual Workbench attempts to open
the SYSTEM.INI file, the new mapping must appear in the PATH prior to the
search drive mapping that maps the Windows directory to the root directory
for a drive. For example, using the mapping for drive G and the example MAP
output above, the MS-DOS PATH environment variable would be as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   PATH=C:\DOS;G:\WINDOWS;Z:.;Y:.;X:.

</PRE>For more information on the NetWare MAP utility and mapping drives, please
see the documentation provided with your Novell NetWare system.
