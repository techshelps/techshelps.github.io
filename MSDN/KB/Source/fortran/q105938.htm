The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information is an extract of the Microsoft FORTRAN
PowerStation QUESTION.TXT file located in the \F32\README directory.
It contains the answers to nine common questions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Question 1</h3>
 
The FORTRAN 5.1 development system ran under MS-DOS and built applications
for MS-DOS and Windows, and DLLs for Windows.  Why does FORTRAN
PowerStation run in Windows and build applications for MS-DOS?
<P>
Answer:
FORTRAN 5.1 is a 16-bit compiler.  There are inherent capacity limitations
associated with the 16-bit architecture.  In order to let users overcome
the DOS 640K barrier, we created FORTRAN 5.1 that could generate QuickWin
applications, essentially 16-bit applications that use extended memory as
managed by Microsoft Windows.  FORTRAN PowerStation is a 32-bit targeted
compiler.  Since Windows for DOS is a 16-bit operating system, it would be
a potential source of performance constraints for 32-bit applications.
32-bit DOS-extended applications, therefore, was the route of choice.
When Windows NT is released, Microsoft will release a 32-bit Windows NT
(Win32) targeted compiler.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 2</h3>
 
Why is a program sometimes faster when compiled with F5.1?
<P>
Answer:
In some cases, code compiled with optimization disabled (-Od) may be faster
with FORTRAN 5.1.  We chose to provide a fast compile (-Od, default) and a
fast execute (-Ox) option.  FORTRAN 5.1 did some optimization even with
-Od. Also there is no optimization default with FORTRAN Powerstation, but
-Ox is the default with version 5.1. Since the default optimization is
different between these versions, it is important to be careful and compare
using the same level of optimization.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 3</h3>
 
How can I get the editor in the Visual Workbench to do column selections
or use macros?
<P>
Answer:
These are not currently features that are available in the FORTRAN Visual
Workbench editor.  If you have a DOS editor that has these capabilities, it
is often convenient to add the DOS editor to the Tools menu in FORTRAN
Visual Workbench. You can do this by going to the Options.Tools menu item
and clicking on the Add button.  When you find the DOS editor executable
file, select it and click OK.  In the resulting dialog box in the Arguments
text entry line, type
<P>
$file
<P>
and click on the OK button.  You will now have an entry under your Tools
menu that when selected will bring up your DOS editor with the file that
is currently in the active window in FORTRAN Visual Workbench.  You can
then edit your file, and when you exit from the DOS editor you will return
to FORTRAN Visual Workbench.  The FORTRAN Visual Workbench will then allow
you to reload the edited file using a dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 4</h3>
 
If I have created a project how do I delete it and its associated files?
<P>
Answer:
If you have created a project named TEST and want to delete it and all of
its associated files you need to delete
<P>
<PRE>   TEST.FMK   This is the project makefile.
   TEST.FPW   This is the project status file.
   TEST.WSP   This is the project workspace file.

</PRE>The easiest way to maintain projects is to have a single project in a
directory.  After saving your source code, you can delete the entire
directory to delete the project.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 5</h3>
 
When I compile with the /Zi option from the command line I get the
following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Usage: cvpack [-p] [-help] exefile
   LINK32() : warning LNK4527: CVPACK error

</PRE>Answer:
Check your path and make sure that F32\BIN is the first thing in the path.
If you have other language products in your path before F32\BIN, the
version of CVPACK.EXE that is used by LINK32.EXE may be incorrect.  If you
type CVPACK at the DOS command line and press ENTER, you should see the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft (R) Debugging Information Compactor  Version 4.21
   Copyright (c) Microsoft Corp 1987-1993. All rights reserved.

</PRE>If you see a version number earlier that the one above, you need to correct
the order of directories in your path so that F32\BIN is first.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 6</h3>
 
I compiled and linked my program and it runs fine on the machine where
FORTRAN Powerstation is installed but when I take it to another machine it
won't run.  How can I make this application run on another machine?
<P>
Answer:
There are two additional files that need to be installed on the machine
where you are going to run the FORTRAN application: DOSXMSF.EXE and
DOSXNT.386. DOSXMSF.EXE is the actual DOS extender that allows your 32-bit
program to run under MS-DOS. DOXSNT.386 is a DPMI device driver that allows
your program to run as a 32-bit DOS-extended program under Windows.
<P>
You need to install DOSXMSF.EXE either in the same directory as the FORTRAN
program or in a directory that is in your DOS PATH environment variable.
DOSXNT.386 is a Windows device driver that is necessary if you want to run
the FORTRAN application in an MS-DOS session under Windows.  To install
DOSXNT.386, you need the following entry in the SYSTEM.INI file under the
[386Enh] section:
<P>
<PRE>   device=C:\F32\BIN\dosxnt.386

</PRE><h3>Question 7</h3>
 
I have a number of assembly code modules that I would like to use with
FORTRAN PowerStation.  How can I do this?
<P>
Answer:
16-bit assembly code must be modified to work with 32-bit applications.
The assembly code will need to be converted to use a 32-bit flat memory
model and, in some cases, will have to adjust for the fact that the
application is running in 32-bit protected-mode and not in real-mode.
Object modules produced by assemblers will probably be OMF-type files.
They will need to be converted to COFF-type object modules. It is
recommended that MASM 6.1 be used for 32-bit programmming.  Please
consult your MASM manual and Chapter 18 of the FORTRAN PowerStation
User's Guide.
<P>
An extended example of 32-bit MASM programming is provided with the
GRDEMO sample project in the ..F32\SAMPLES\DEMO directory. The file
MOUSE.ASM is a MASM routine used in the sample. The comments in this
file include tips on assembly language programming.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 8</h3>
 
I see various components of the package with Windows NT in the name.  Do I
need Windows NT to run this product?
<P>
Answer:
Microsoft has committed to producing a Windows NT compiler.  Certain
elements of the FORTRAN PowerStation have been designed to facilitate the
process of supporting the Windows NT operating system in future products.
But this product is targeted at 32-bit DOS, and Windows NT is not a
supported or required element of this package.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 9</h3>
 
I used to do mixed-language programming with high-level languages and
FORTRAN. Can I do this with FORTRAN Powerstation?
<P>
Answer:
The object modules produced with 16-bit versions of C will not link
correctly with FORTRAN Powerstation object modules. You can use one of the
32-bit C compilers available from Microsoft and other vendors to produce
object modules that can be linked with FORTRAN Powerstation object modules.
