<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
An application note is available that explains how to correct a problem
with writing huge data items to unformatted binary files within FORTRAN
version 5.1 QuickWin. When writing a data item greater than 64K to an
unformatted or binary data file from within QuickWin, an Unrecoverable
Application Error (UAE) may result.
<P>
Application notes can be obtained by calling Microsoft Product Support
Services.
<P>
This file has been removed from the Microsoft Software Library but can be
requested by calling Microsoft Product Support Services.

</PRE>This application note illustrates how to modify the FORTRAN version
5.1 Windows run-time library LLIBFEW.LIB to correct a problem with
HUGE data items and unformatted or binary files.
<P>
A program compiled with FORTRAN 5.1 for use with Windows can cause an
unrecoverable application error (UAE) in Windows. A UAE may occur if
the program opens a file whose form is either binary or unformatted
and then READs or WRITEs to that file using elements of HUGE arrays
that are beyond the first 64K of the array.
<P>
Included on the enclosed "Patch for QuickWin Unformatted File and HUGE
Data Problem" disk are two replacement object modules for two object
modules in the Windows library LLIBFEW.LIB. These replacement modules
correct the above problem.
<P>
The files on the enclosed disk are:
<P>
<PRE>     APPLOAD.OBJ
     RELOC.OBJ

</PRE>To make a patched version of the Windows library LLIBFEW.LIB, copy
APPLOAD.OBJ and RELOC.OBJ from the enclosed disk to the directory
where LLIBFEW.LIB is located. Then, execute the following command:
<P>
<PRE>    lib llibfew.lib -+appload.obj -+reloc.obj;

</PRE>This command will use the Microsoft Library Manager to replace the
existing object modules in the library with the new patched versions
of the object modules. You can then delete APPLOAD.OBJ and RELOC.OBJ
from your hard disk.
<P>
