<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The application note titled "EXEC Function for FORTRAN" contains a
function similar to the SPAWNLP function. The SPAWNLP function,
included in the Microsoft FORTRAN 5.0 and 5.1 packages, suspends
program execution and spawns a child process while leaving the parent
process in memory. When this child process terminates, control returns
to the parent process. On the other hand, the EXEC function terminates
the parent process, taking the parent process out of memory, and then
spawns the child process. Upon termination of the child process, the
program is completed.
<P>
This application note "EXEC Function for FORTRAN" can be obtained by
calling Microsoft Product Support Services.
<P>
This application note is also available in the Microsoft Software Library.

</PRE>Simulating the P_OVERLAY Function of _spawnlp with the Microsoft
FORTRAN Optimizing Compiler Versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1, 5.0, and 5.1
<P>
Versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1, 5.0, and 5.1 of the Microsoft FORTRAN
Optimizing Compiler do not support the option within the _spawnlp
function that allows a second user program to completely overwrite the
space used by the program that initiates it. The programs supplied
with this application note use a slightly different mechanism to
provide this missing functionality. The EXEC function works under the
DOS operating system only.
<P>
The following files are provided on the FORTRAN 4.0, 4.01, 4.1, 5.0,
5.1 EXEC Function disk included with this application note:
<P>
<PRE>   Filename            Description of File
   --------            -------------------

   README.DOC          Text of application note.

   EXEC.INC            A FORTRAN INTERFACE file that must be included
                       in every source file calling EXEC.

   LV40EXEC.LIB        Large memory model library for version 4.0 and
                       4.01 containing the routines necessary to
                       perform an EXEC.

   MV40EXEC.LIB        Medium memory model library for version 4.0 and
                       4.01 containing the routines necessary to
                       perform an EXEC.

   LV41EXEC.LIB        Large memory model library for versions 4.1 and
                       5.0 containing the routines necessary to
                       perform an EXEC.

   MV41EXEC.LIB        Medium memory model library for versions 4.1
                       and 5.0 containing the routines necessary to
                       perform an EXEC.

   LV51EXEC.LIB        Large memory model library for version 5.1
                       containing the routines necessary to perform an
                       EXEC.

   MV51EXEC.LIB        Medium memory model library for version 5.1
                       containing the routines necessary to perform an
                       EXEC.

   TEST1.FOR           Program to test an EXEC. It is more than
                       300,000 bytes in size and will EXEC the TEST2
                       program, which is of similar size. The
                       intention is to show that the two programs,
                       TEST1.FOR and EST2.FOR, which cannot fit in
                       memory at the same time, can be executed
                       individually.

   TEST2.FOR           Program to be executed by TEST1.

</PRE>Link the program that calls EXEC (TEST1 in this case) with the
appropriate library listed above. For example, when using FORTRAN 5.1
for the large memory model, the compile line should look as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   fl test1.for LV51EXEC.LIB

</PRE>This will compile TEST1.FOR and link it with the FORTRAN run-time
library in addition to the EXEC function library specified.
<P>
Note: TEST1 and TEST2 are completely independent of each other. They
can even be compiled with different memory models.
