<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS versions 1.0 and 1.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Calling CommitQQ after writing data will not force the data to be
written to the physical device. Any data in the buffer that was not
already  written to the device will remain in the buffer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The only way to flush the write buffer is to close the I/O unit and
then re-open it. For sequential files the status should be "APPEND"
when re-opening.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was fixed in Fortran
PowerStation 32 for Windows NT, version 1.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The problem can be demonstrated as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Build the sample program TCOMMIT.FOR in the \F32\SAMPLES\RUNTIME
   directory, and run the executable from Windows.

<P><LI>Type in some text when asked. When the program displays
   "If you boot now, your text will be saved," go to File Manager.

<P><LI>In File Manager, display the directory \F32\SAMPLES\RUNTIME with full
   file details.

<P><LI>Press the &lt;F5&gt; key to refresh (ensuring that the latest information
   about the files is being displayed).

<P><LI>Check the size of 'COMMITQQ.TST.'

<P><LI>The size of 'COMMITQQ.TST' will still be zero indicating that the
   write buffers were not flushed despite calling the CommitQQ
   function. Go back to the TCOMMIT program, and press the &lt;Enter&gt; key
   twice to exit.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 3, 4, and 5. The size of 'COMMITQQ.TST' will no longer be
   zero. This indicates that the write buffers were flushed only when the
   file unit was closed on program termination.
<P></OL>
