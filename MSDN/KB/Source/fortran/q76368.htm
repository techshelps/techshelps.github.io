</PRE>This application note illustrates how to modify the QuickWin default
for program termination. Included on the enclosed "Alternatives to
QuickWin Termination Message Box" disk are the files listed below;
these files include the new object modules to be added to the QuickWin
run-time library, a batch file that adds the object files to the
QuickWin run-time library, and a sample program that asks the user
which of the three available exit methods to use to terminate the
application.
<P>
<PRE>   File           Description
   ----           -----------

   EXMODE.FOR     FORTRAN QuickWin program example

   QWIN.LIB       Library of object modules to be added to the
                  QuickWin run-time library

   EXITMODE.OBJ   Additional object module to be added to the
                  QuickWin run-time library

   REPLACE.BAT    Batch file that modifies the existing QuickWin
                  run-time library to include QWIN.LIB and
                  EXITMODE.OBJ

   FLIB.FI        Updated FLIB.FI

   FLIB.FD        Updated FLIB.FD

</PRE>There are three alternatives for terminating a QuickWin application:

<OL><P><LI>A termination message box is displayed on conclusion of a QuickWin
   application, asking the user whether or not to close the
   application window. This is the default method.

<P><LI>No message box is displayed on conclusion of the QuickWin
   application, and the application window is closed.

<P><LI>No message box is displayed on conclusion of the QuickWin
   application, and the application window remains active.
<P>
</OL>Alternatives 2 and 3 require modification of the QuickWin run-time
library and the FLIB.FI and FLIB.FD files.
<P>
<P><h3>Implementing the Alternative Exit Mode Functions</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Copy the QWIN.LIB, EXITMODE.OBJ, and REPLACE.BAT files from the
   enclosed disk to your \FORTRAN\LIB directory.

<P><LI>Run the batch file REPLACE.BAT by typing "replace" (without the
   quotation marks) at the command prompt from within the
   \FORTRAN\LIB directory. Your existing LLIBFEW.LIB library will
   be changed.

<P><LI>Replace the FLIB.FI and FLIB.FD files in your \FORTRAN\INCLUDE
   directory with those on the enclosed disk.
<P>
</OL>After you make these modifications, two new functions (SETEXITQQ and
GETEXITQQ) that control the termination message box mode will be
available to you. The interfaces for these two functions are as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>    INTERFACE TO INTEGER*2 FUNCTION SETEXITQQ(EXITMODE)
        INTEGER*2 EXITMODE
    END

    INTERFACE TO INTEGER*2 FUNCTION GETEXITQQ()
    END

</PRE></OL>SETEXITQQ returns a 0 for success and a -1 for failure. The function
will fail upon an incorrect argument. SETEXITQQ takes an argument of
one of the following three constant values and sets the exit mode
accordingly:
<P>
<PRE>   Constant Value      Result
   --------------      ------

   QWIN$EXITPROMPT     Sets the exit mode to display the termination
                       message box (the default)

   QWIN$EXITNOPERSIST  Sets the exit mode to suppress the
                       termination message box and closes the
                       application window

   QWIN$EXITPERSIST    Sets the exit mode to suppress the termination
                       message box and leaves the application window
                       open

</PRE>GETEXITQQ returns the current exit mode, which is one of the above
constant values.
<P>
<P><h3>Running the Sample Program</h3>
 
<P>
After copying EXMODE.FOR to your hard disk, compile the program at the
command prompt as follows:
<P>
<PRE>    fl /MW exmode.for

</PRE>Run the program as you would any QuickWin application, either by
selecting EXMODE.EXE from the File Manager, by choosing Run from the
File menu and typing the full path to EXMODE.EXE, or by typing the
following at the command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>    win exmode

</PRE>The sample program prompts you for the desired exit mode (select 1 for
QWIN$EXITPROMPT, 2 for QWIN$EXITNOPERSIST, or 3 for QWIN$EXITPERSIST).
The program then uses GETEXITQQ to display the current exit mode and
uses SETEXITQQ to set the exit mode to the desired value. If the exit
mode is correctly set, the program then calls GETEXITQQ to display the
new exit mode before exiting as directed.
