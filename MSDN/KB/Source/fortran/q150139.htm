The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT,
   version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Saving a fixed-form source file that contains at least one physical TAB
character at the beginning of a source line, to a file with some other
non-default extension (such as .txt) by selecting Save As from the
File menu in Developer Studio, causes one of the following application
errors at run time:
<P>
Under Windows 95:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

   Details:

   MSDEV caused an invalid page fault in module MSVCSRC.DLL

</PRE>Under Windows NT version 3.51:
<P>
<PRE>   The instruction at "0x00000000" referenced memory at "0x00000000".
   The memory could not be "read".

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Before saving the file using Save As option, change the file type to free-
form by right-clicking in the editor window and selecting Properties.
Change the Language combo-box option to Fortran Free. Then you can safely
choose Save As from the File menu.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open a source file that has an .for extension and verify that at least
   one source line begins with a physical TAB character. The Celsius.for
   file located in \Msdev\Projects\Celsius is formatted with TAB
   characters.

<P><LI>From the Developer Studio File menu, choose Save As, and save the file
   with a .txt extension. In some cases, Developer Studio (MSDEV) shuts
   down without warning, and in others, it hangs (stops responding) and'
   displays an application error.
<P></OL>
