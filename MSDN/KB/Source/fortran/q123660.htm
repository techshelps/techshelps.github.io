The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0 and 1.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There has been a maintenance release of FORTRAN PowerStation that fixed
several bugs in the first release. To get a list of Microsoft Knowledge
Base (KB) articles describing bugs that were fixed, use this query:
<P>
<PRE>   PowerStation kbfixlist 1.0a

</PRE>The following are some of the components that were updated:

<UL><LI>The subcomponents of the compiler
<LI>The linker
<LI>The MS-DOS-extenders
<LI>The debugger
<LI>Many library functions
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>How to Find Out If You Have the Latest Version</h3>
 
<P>
The new version was released in March of 1994. The manuals and other
documentation, as well as the version displayed by the compiler, continue
to show the version as 1.0. There are a number of ways to identify if you
are using the latest version:

<UL><LI>Approximately half of the components of FORTRAN PowerStation were
   updated in the new release. They all have dates after March 1993.

<LI>The new linker is based on the ones that shipped with FORTRAN
   PowerStation 32 for Windows NT and Visual C++, 32-bit edition. The old
   linker version was 2.8, and the new version is 1.0F. To check the
   version of the linker, type the following at an MS-DOS prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      link | more
</PRE>
<LI>The version of CVPACK also changed. The old version was 4.21, and the
   new version is 4.25. To check the version, type the following at an
   MS-DOS prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cvpack
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>How to Get and Install the Update</h3>
 
<P>
To get the update, call your local Microsoft subsidiary. The update
contains a full set of replacement disks (not including Numerical Recipes
which did not get updated) that you should install in exactly the same way
as the original. We recommend that you delete all components of the
original version before installing the new version. Be sure to search the
entire disk and delete all of the old components -- particularly every copy
of the old MS-DOS-extenders.
<P>
<P><h3>Problems Using Components of Both Releases Together</h3>
 
<P>
There are two problems that can occur when components of both the first
release and the maintenance release are used together:

<UL><LI>You may get error DX1410, which is caused by the existence of older
   versions of the MS-DOS-extenders.

<LI>You may get a variety of LINK or CVPACK errors, which are caused by
   using libraries created with the new version when building programs with
   the old version.
