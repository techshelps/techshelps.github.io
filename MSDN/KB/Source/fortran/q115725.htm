<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information is from parts 6 and 7 of the Microsoft
FORTRAN PowerStation README.TXT file located in the \F32\README
directory.
<P>
<PRE>   Part 6: Using the Debugger
   Part 7: Miscellaneous

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Part 6: Using the Debugger</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Optimizing Debugging Speed</h3>
 
Because a program being debugged runs as a separate task under Windows,
the speed at which the debugger operates depends upon how many other
programs are being executed at the same time. If screen-swapping is
disabled, FORTRAN Visual Workbench must yield control back to Windows,
and any other program waiting for cycles is serviced along with the
program being debugged in the remote monitor window. To improve the
speed of the debugger, don't run other applications at the same time.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Watching Complex Variables in Commons</h3>
 
Debugging code that has complex variables in common blocks causes the
watch window to display them as characters. This affects common record
variables. They are shown in the locals window as a single space rather
than as a structure.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Debugging MASM 6.11 Modules</h3>
 
When assembling modules with MASM 6.11, add the "-coff" switch to the
ML command line.  This will ensure proper debugging of assembly modules
in the Visual Workbench.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Using Mixed Source/Asm during Debugging</h3>
 
You can only view Mixed Source/Asm (selected from the View menu)
during a debugging session if you have not built the target with the
/Ox option (Optimize for Time). (The release version will disable
Mixed Source/Asm if the /Ox option is enabled in the Compiler Options
dialog box.) If you attempt to view Mixed Source/Asm for a target
built with the /Ox option, the debugger will not be able to show all
of the assembly instructions. Unexpected results may occur.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Viewing Strings and Arrays in the Locals Window</h3>
 
When you first step into a program or routine, you will not be able to
see the values or variable-length strings or allocatable arrays until
you step at least once inside the subprogram. This is because the
lengths are not computed until after the debugger has begun executing
subprogram code. Once you have stepped into the subprogram, you can
view the values of single dimensional allocatable arrays.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Debugging Very Large Programs</h3>
 
Although it is possible to debug a program that has an executable file
and symbol table that are close to (or larger than) the amount of
physical memory in your PC, the debugger will take longer to load the
symbols. This is because the Windows memory manager must swap portions
of memory during loading.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Part 7: Miscellaneous</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Differences between Version 1.0 and Version 1.0a</h3>
 
Version 1.0a has many bug fixes in the compiler, runtime library, and
debugger.  The DOS Extender has been updated to the version used by
newer versions of MASM and Visual C++.  Version 1.0a also includes new
samples, including TechNotes and information on mixing FORTRAN and
C/C++.  ANSWERS.TXT has been updated (as has the corresponding
"Obtaining Product Support" help file) with answers to common questions
that we receive about FORTRAN PowerStation.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Running Programs</h3>
 
FORTRAN Programs can be executed from the FORTRAN Visual Workbench
either in a window or in full-screen mode. You select which to use in
the Execute/Debug Options dialog box. FORTRAN programs can be run from
an MS-DOS session within Windows either in a window or in full-screen
mode. You can switch between these modes from within the MS-DOS session
by pressing ALT-ENTER. You can also select the mode for a minimized
MS-DOS session from the Settings dialog box.
<P>
Programs which use graphics may not run properly within a window. In
most cases, Microsoft Windows will ask you to switch to full-screen mode
if the graphics mode is not supported by the graphics driver. Some
graphics modes are only partially supported in a window. In this case,
the results will depend upon which graphics routines are used by the
program.
<P>
For best results, we recommend that graphics programs are always
executed in full-screen mode.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Redistribution Rights</h3>
 
You have the right to distribute the MS-DOS extender files DOSXMSF.EXE
and DOSXNT.386 with programs that you create with FORTRAN PowerStation.
There is no royalty required.
<P>
The font files COURB.FON, HELVB.FON and TMSRB.FON are owned by
BitStream, Inc. If you want to distribute these files with a program,
you will need to get permission from BitStream.  The other .FON files
may be freely distributed (including those in the SAMPLES\TECHNOTE\FONTS
directory).
<P>
If you have any questions about redistribution rights, please contact
Microsoft Product Support Services.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Product Support Services</h3>
 
The information under "Help | Obtaining Product Support" in the
Visual Workbench is more up to date than the information given in the
FORTRAN PowerStation User's Guide.  Please refer to the on-line
version when you need to contact Microsoft Product Support Services.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>TECHNOTE Directory</h3>
 
The SAMPLES\TECHNOTE directory contains TechNotes, technical notes and
sample programs to help you better use FORTRAN PowerStation.  You will
find the following TechNotes in this directory:
<P>
<PRE>Fonts:        A set of additonal bitmapped fonts for use with graphics.lib,
       complete with sample program.

</PRE>Port_IO:  Routines to perform hardware port I/O from FORTRAN (equivalent
<PRE>       to assembly language IN and OUT instructions).

</PRE>Printer:  Routines to reset and control the printer.
<P>
Each TechNote directory contains a .TXT file with further information.
<P>
TechNotes are provided for your information and to help you.  However,
the information and programs included are not as thoroughly tested as
other sample programs.  Please take this into account when using these
notes in your own programs.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Mixed Language Programming with C/C++</h3>
 
Mixed language programming is possible between FORTRAN PowerStation and
Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit edition.  For more information, please
read MIXED_C.TXT in the F32\SAMPLES\MIXED_C directory.
<P>
<P><h3>About Other Text Files</h3>
 
<P>
There are three other text files with information about Microsoft
FORTRAN PowerStation.
