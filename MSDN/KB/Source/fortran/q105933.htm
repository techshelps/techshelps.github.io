The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0 and 1.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The corrections to the manuals shipped with Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation
for MS-DOS are described below. This is an extract of the ADDENDA.TXT file
located in the \F32\README directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Part 1: Corrections to Getting Started</h3>
 
There are no corrections to Getting Started.
<P>
<P><h3>Part 2: Corrections to Language Guide</h3>

Add the following note to the second bullet describing an iolist:
"If I/O is to or from a formatted device, an iolist may not contain
structure variables, but it may contain structure elements. If I/O is to
a binary or unformatted device, it can contain either a structure element
or a structure variable."
<P>
Page 85
Add the following comment to the discussion of backslash editing:
"The dollar sign ($) can be used as an alias for the backslash edit
descriptor."
<P>
Page 129, 131
Delete the table entries for GETCONFIGQQ.
<P>
Page 199
Input to intrinsic function ABS can also be any real or integer type.
<P>
Page 203
The purpose of intrinsic function AMAX0 should read:
"Returns the maximum of a list of integer values."
<P>
Page 203
The purpose of intrinsic function AMAX1 should read:
"Returns the maximum of a list of integer values and performs
type conversion."
<P>
Page 204
The purpose of intrinsic function AMIN1 should read:
"Returns the minimum of a list of integer values and performs
type conversion."
<P>
Page 214
The order of the parameters for BEEPQQ is reversed; frequency is the
first parameter. The frequency parameter in should be Hz, not KHz.
The duration should be in milliseconds.
<P>
Page 256
One of the examples for the DINT intrinsic function is documented
incorrectly. The examples show:
<PRE>   DINT(2.6D0)       2.0000 ....
   DINT(2.6D0)      -2.0000 ....
</PRE>The second line should read: (note the minus sign in the argument)
<PRE>   DINT(-2.6D0)     -2.0000 ....

</PRE>Page 314
Change error parameters ENOENT and EINVAL to ERR$NOENT and ERR$INVAL.
<P>
Page 319
The first five fontinfo structure variables in graphic function
GETFONTINFO (type, ascent, pixwidth, pixheight and avgwidth) are
shown as Integer*2; they should be Integer*4.
<P>
Pages 322-323
The naming convention for run-time error parameters was documented
incorrectly. The following table shows the actual names of these
parameters in the FLIB.FD include file:
<P>
<PRE>   Change        to
   ========      =========
   E2BIG         ERR$2BIG
   EACCES        ERR$ACCES
   EBADF         ERR$BADF
   EINVAL        ERR$INVAL
   EIVAL         ERR$IVAL
   EMFILE        ERR$MFILE
   ENOENT        ERR$NOENT
   ENOEXEC       ERR$NOEXEC
   ENOMEM        ERR$NOMEM
   ERANGE        ERR$RANGE

</PRE>Page 338
The Remarks section states that error constants are in FGRAPH.FI.
Actually they are in FGRAPH.FD.
<P>
Several error constants were omitted from the table:
<PRE>   $GRTEXTNOTSUPPORTED     (  4)
      The VESA TSR or BIOS sets a flag that may indicate that text output
      is not supported. (Note: this flag is used inconsistently by
      different hardware vendors and may not be significant.)
   $GRNOBITMAPFILE         (-10)
   $GRFILEREADERROR        (-11)
   $GRIMPROPERBITMAPFORMAT (-12)
   $GRBITMAPTOOLARGE       (-13)
   $GRBITMAPDISPLAYERROR   (-14)
   $GRIMAGEREADERROR       (-15)
   $GRFILEOPENERROR        (-16)
   $GRFILEWRITEERROR       (-17)

</PRE>The declaration of $GRTEXTNOTSUPPORTED has been omitted from FGRAPH.FD,
therefore, you will get the following error when you use this constant and
compile with /4Yd:
<P>
<PRE>   warning F4313: $GRTEXTNOTSUPPORTED: not previously declared

</PRE>To work around this problem, open FGRAPH.FD, go to line 54, and add:
<P>
<PRE>   + $GRTEXTNOTSUPPORTED

</PRE>Page 376-377
Run-time subroutines SCWRQQ and SSWRQQ were incorrectly used as
functions in the sample program TCOPO.FOR.
<P>
Page 381-382
Graphic Functions LOADIMAGE and LOADIMAGE_W are INTEGER*2 functions.
The coordinate parameters wxcoord and wycoord are DOUBLE PRECISION,
not REAL*4.
<P>
Page 386
The error parameters for MAKEDIRQQ were documented incorrectly.
<PRE>   Change      to
   ------      ---------
   EACCES      ERR$ACCES
   ENOENT      ERR$NOENT

</PRE>Page 439
The error parameters for RENAMEFILEQQ were documented incorrectly.
<PRE>   Change      to
   ------      ---------
   EACCES      ERR$ACCES
   ENOENT      ERR$NOENT
   EXDEV       ERR$XDEV

</PRE>Page 444-445
The coordinate parameters (ulwxcoord, ulwycoord, lrwxcoord and
lrwycoord) are Double Precision, not Real*4.
<P>
Page 457-458
Run-time subroutines GETCONTROLFPQQ and GETSTATUSFPQQ were incorrectly
used as functions in the sample program TCOP.FOR. The source for TCOP.FOR
in the samples directory and in Help is correct.
<P>
Page 462
The error parameters for SETFILETIMEQQ were documented incorrectly.
<PRE>   Change      to
   ------      ---------
   EACCESS     ERR$ACCES
   EINVAL      ERR$INVAL
   EMFILE      ERR$MFILE
   ENOENT      ERR$NOENT

</PRE>Page 478
The remarks for Graphics subroutine SETTEXTWINDOW should read:
<P>
"Use SETTEXTWINDOW to specify a window in row and column coordinates
where text output written to the screen using the OUTTEXT() subroutine
is displayed. (You must set up the location with SETTEXTPOSITION.)
The arguments (r1, c1) specify the upper-left corner of the text
window, and the arguments (r2, c2) specify the lower-right corner
of the text window.
<P>
Text is output from the top of the text window down. When the text
window is full, successive lines overwrite the last line."
<P>
Page 496
The duration parameter of run-time subroutine SLEEPQQ should be in
milliseconds, not microseconds.
<P>
Page 507
The error parameters for SYSTEMQQ were documented incorrectly.
<PRE>   Change      to
   ------      ---------
   E2BIG       ERR$2BIG
   ENOINT      ERR$NOINT
   ENOEXEC     ERR$NOEXEC
   ENOMEM      ERR$NOMEM

</PRE>Page 522
Appendix A erroneously states that the following VAX extensions are
supported by FORTRAN PowerStation:
1) Inline variable length formatting
<PRE>   (e.g.: FORMAT('I&lt;var&gt;'), where var = 5)
</PRE>2) Call intrinsics (%val, %descr, %ref, %loc)
<P>
<P><h3>Part 3: Corrections to User's Guide</h3>
 
Page 15, 22
You can also use CTRL+K to find matching braces.
<P>
Pages 67-68
The Create Assembly Listing checkbox is documented incorrectly. The
compiler option associated with this option is /FAs, not /Fl. This option
produces an assembly listing with code bytes, not an assembly listing with
source.
<P>
Page 109
Add the following to the discussion of syntax coloring.
"FORTRAN Visual Workbench displays metacommands in the same color as
comments if syntax coloring is activated."
<P>
Pages 144-145
A new set of options has been added for producing assembly listings. The
syntax is /FA[sc]. Use /FAs to add FORTRAN source lines to the assembly
listing, and /FAc to add code bytes to the assembly listing. /FAsc will
produce an assembly listing with both FORTRAN source lines and code bytes.
<P>
Page 170
Add this to the end of Section 11.2.3 Using Command Files:
<P>
The following example demonstrates the use of command files (also
known as response files) to provide input to LINK32.
Example:
<PRE>         LINK32 -LIB @MYRESP.RSP

</PRE>A typical response file might contain:
<PRE>         -OUT:MYLIB.LIB
         OBJECT1.OBJ
         OBJECT2.OBJ
         (and so forth)

</PRE>Page 258
Page 294
Page 297
The default floating-point exception behavior is slightly different
from that described in the text.  By default, run-time errors occur
for the INVALID, ZERODIVIDE, and OVERFLOW exceptions.  By default,
run-time errors occur for the math exceptions except for when you use
the compiler option /Ox.  See the README.TXT file for a summary of the
complete floating-point exception behavior and details on how to
customize that behavior to be strictly the IEEE behavior as described
in the text.
<P>
Page 284
Replace the text:
<P>
"Some older 80386 systems have 287 coprocessors instead of 387s; the
287 math coprocessor does not perform floating-point operations on
these systems."
<P>
with the text:
<P>
"Some older 80386 systems have 287 coprocessors instead of 387s;
some floating-point operations will not work correctly in these cases.
To fix this, you must force use of the floating-point emulator by
setting the TNT environment variable as follows.  At the MS-DOS (or
Windows MS-DOS session) command line, enter "SET TNT=-FPEM" before
running your compiled program.  To cancel the forced emulation you can
enter "SET TNT=-NOFPEM"."
