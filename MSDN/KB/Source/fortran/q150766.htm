The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for Windows 95 and Windows NT,
   version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
This article includes a patch fix that addresses a problem known to occur
when data is being put into a QuickWin application. The problem occurs:

<UL><LI>With QuickWin applications compiled with Microsoft Fortran PowerStation.

<LI>Only while using the Input Method Editor (IME).

<LI>While running on some Far East versions of Windows 95 and Windows NT.
<P>
</UL>When you run a Fortran QuickWin application on some Far East versions of
Windows 95 and Windows NT, and use the Input Method Editor (IME) to perform
input, the program exhibits one of the following problems at run time:

<OL><P><LI>The Input Method Editor (IME) conversion window does not show up at
   the caret position input string.

<P><LI>The QuickWin application hangs when you change the screen mode to full
   screen (Japanese version of Windows 95 only).

<P><LI>The application incorrectly displays the input data in the input field
   when you READ data from the Input Method Editor (IME) into a QuickWin
   application. This causes some characters to appear truncated (Japanese
   version of Windows NT, version 3.51 only).

<P><LI>When you use the BACKSPACE key to remove characters entered into your
   QuickWin application in response to a READ statement using the Input
   Method Editor (IME), only one byte from the double-byte character is
   removed. This causes the double-byte character to appear truncated.
   However, the correct number of double-byte characters is removed from
   the input stream. (Korean, Taiwanese, and Japanese versions of Windows
   95, as well as the Japanese version of Windows NT version 3.51 are
   affected.)
<P>
</OL>Note: There is no version of Microsoft Fortran PowerStation localized to
any of these countries.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve these problems, follow these steps:

<UL><LI>Copy the file QWPATCH.EXE to your system.

<LI>Run QWPATCH.EXE to extract the QWIN.LIB file (QWPATCH includes a
   copy of this article).

<LI>Replace the QWIN.LIB in your \MSDEV\LIB directory with the new version
   of QWIN.LIB.

<LI>Rebuild any application that calls the QuickWin subsystem.
