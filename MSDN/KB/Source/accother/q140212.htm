<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

<PRE> 1. Q. How can developers distribute solutions built with Microsoft
       Access for Windows 95 version 7.0?

    A. The Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit for Windows 95 includes
       a royalty-free run-time license that permits developers to
       distribute solutions built with Microsoft Access via a "run-time
       version" of Microsoft Access for Windows 95.

 2. Q. What are the differences between the retail and run-time versions
       of Microsoft Access for Windows 95?

    A. The retail and run-time versions are exactly the same, except that
       design capabilities have been "turned off" in the run-time version.
       Turning off design capabilities means that solution users can
       change the data but not the design of their solution. Examples of
       design changes include modifying database objects (tables, forms,
       reports, and queries) and using the wizards in Microsoft Access.
       The run-time version also does not support the new Filter-By-Form
       feature in Microsoft Access for Windows 95 because this is
       technically a design capability.

       Users who want design capabilities can purchase and install the
       retail version of Microsoft Access.

 3. Q. Does the run-time version support the replication features of
       Microsoft Access?

    A. The run-time version of Microsoft Access supports any replication
       scheme set up by the developer of the solution. (Replication
       information is stored in the database (.MDB file) itself, so it
       is not effected by the run-time version of Microsoft Access).
       Replication features which are dependent on changing the design
       of the database (for example, Briefcase replication) require a
       retail installation of Microsoft Access.

 4. Q. Does the run-time version support the security features of
       Microsoft Access?

    A. The run-time version of Microsoft Access supports the Microsoft
       Access security model which developers can use to secure data and
       solutions from unauthorized user access. This means that users
       receiving the run-time solution cannot alter the security
       implementation or their permissions on the database. This is true
       even if the user purchases a retail version of Microsoft Access
       because the security information is stored separately in
       SYSTEM.MDA, and cannot be modified by anyone but the developer.

 5. Q. Can developers use the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit for
       Windows 95 to distribute Microsoft Access 2.0 solutions?

    A. No. The Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit for Windows 95
       supports solutions developed with Microsoft Access for Windows 95.
       Developers wanting to distribute solutions with Microsoft Access
       2.0 should purchase the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit 2.0.
       (This product will be available for a limited time after the
       Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit for Windows 95 is commercially
       available.) Please contact your local reseller or Microsoft account
       representative for more information on any of these products.

       Registered Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit 2.0 owners can
       receive a $100 rebate when they upgrade to Microsoft Access
       Developer's Toolkit for Windows 95. (The rebate coupon is included
       in the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit and is valid until
       December 31, 1996.)

 6. Q. Can developers continue to use both versions of the Microsoft
       Access Developer's Toolkit to distribute solutions in mixed
       environments?

    A. Yes. The Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit for Windows 95
       license permits developers to continue to use the Microsoft
       Access Developer's Toolkit version 2.0 after upgrading to the
       newer version.

       Note that developers may not transfer their Microsoft Access
       Developer's Toolkit 2.0 license to anyone else after upgrading to
       the Windows 95 version, unless both versions are transferred to
       the new licensee. The Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit for
       Windows 95 license agreement covers this topic in more detail.

 7. Q. Does a single copy of the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit
       license multiple developers working together to each distribute
       solutions?

    A. No. The Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit is licensed on a per-
       developer basis. Each license permits one developer to distribute
       an unlimited number of solutions with the run-time version of
       Microsoft Access. Developers must purchase their own copy of
       the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit if they want to distribute
       solutions using the Microsoft Access run-time version.

       A company or organization that purchases a copy of the Microsoft
       Access Developer's Toolkit must designate a single developer who
       will be given the right to use the software.

       As an illustration, assume there are two developers in a company,
       DEV-A and DEV-B, and a single customer named CUST who uses their
       Microsoft Access solutions. If DEV-A purchases the Microsoft Access
       Developer's Toolkit (or the company purchased it and designated
       DEV-A as the license holder) and provides a run-time version of
       Microsoft Access to CUST, then DEV-A can distribute an unlimited
       number of Microsoft Access solutions or databases to CUST.

       DEV-A only has to provide CUST the run-time version in the first
       solution. Each subsequent solution or database can then reuse the
       run-time version that CUST has already received from DEV-A.

       If DEV-B wants to distribute a solution built with Microsoft Access
       to CUST, DEV-B is not licensed to use the Microsoft Access run-time
       version until he or she purchases the Microsoft Access Developer's
       Toolkit.

       The important point is that once DEV-B has purchased the Microsoft
       Access Developer's Toolkit, DEV-B has the right to distribute the
       run-time version. DEV-B may also rely on a run-time version a
       customer has already received through a solution provided by another
       Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit licensee. DEV-B may do this,
       provided that he or she has purchased the Microsoft Access
       Developer's Toolkit.

 8. Q. Where else can developers get information about using the run-time
       version of Microsoft Access for Windows 95?

    A. Additional information is in the End User License Agreement (in
       the product box), including guidelines on the types of solutions
       that may be distributed with the run-time version and legal
       restrictions on international distribution of run-time solutions.

 9. Q. Can developers distribute all the files that are in the Microsoft
       Access Developer's Toolkit?

    A. No, certain files are not redistributable. For a complete list of
       files which can be redistributed, see the ADTEULA.TXT file in the
       Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit. This file is installed in the
       ADT directory as part of the setup process.

       ADTEULA.TXT includes two listings of the redistributable files in
       the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit. The first section,
       REDISTRIBUTABLE FILE LISTING, includes all redistributable files
       other than Microsoft Replication Manager files. Microsoft
       Replication Manager redistributable files are listed in the second
       section, REPLICATION MANAGER REDISTRIBUTABLE FILE LISTING. These
       two redistributable file listings are each governed by different
       licensing terms. Consult the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit
       license agreement for further details.

10. Q. What are "Data Access Objects" (or what is DAO)?

    A. Data Access Objects, or DAO, is the OLE Automation interface to the
       Jet database engine. DAO is how developers programmatically control
       the Jet database engine in products which include Jet such as
       Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Office, Microsoft
       Visual Basic, and Microsoft Visual C++.

       DAO and the Jet engine are actually the same component, but the OLE
       Automation interface enables developers to work with the Jet engine
       outside of an application that includes Jet. For example, once DAO
       and Jet are installed on a desktop (by any of the Microsoft
       applications listed above), a developer can programmatically control
       the Jet engine using Visual Basic for Applications in Microsoft
       Project. In effect, this means the developer is enabled to use Jet
       as a stand-alone database engine in addition to using it with the
       application that installed it.

11. Q. How do developers distribute solutions that use DAO?

    A. There are three cases:

       1. If the developer builds a solution in an application that
          includes Jet but does not have a run-time version, for example
          Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Office, the developer must purchase
          and install a copy of the application on each user's desktop for
          the solution to run correctly.

       2. If the developer builds a solution in an application that
          includes Jet and provides a run-time license or compilation, for
          example Microsoft Access (with the Microsoft Access Developers
          Toolkit), Microsoft Visual Basic, or Microsoft Visual C++,
          subject to the end user license agreements accompanying each of
          these products, the developer can build and distribute the
          solution to users with a run-time version or as a compiled
          application (.EXE).

       3. If the developer builds a solution in an application which does
          NOT include Jet, but relies on Jet, (for example, Microsoft
          Project or Microsoft Visual FoxPro), the developer faces two
          requirements. First, the developer must adhere to the license
          agreement for the application used to develop the solution.
          Second, the developer must purchase and install a copy of a
          Microsoft application or tool which DOES include Jet on the
          user's desktop.

12. Q. Can users access Jet through the DAO interface if they have a
       solution on their desktop created in Microsoft Access (via the
       Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit), Microsoft Visual Basic, or
       Microsoft Visual C++?

    A. This question maps to the second case listed above.

       In fact, users that receive a solution which was built in one of
       these applications are not able to access DAO. In other words,
       although Jet may in fact be on the user's desktop, DAO is a design
       capability which is not enabled in run-time or compiled solutions.

       Users that want to use DAO can purchase and install any application
       that includes the Jet database engine, including Microsoft Access,
       Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Visual Basic, or
       Microsoft Visual C++.

13. Q. What are the licensing guidelines for developers who want to use
       DAO to programmatically control replication with the Jet database
       engine?

    A. There is no difference between using DAO to programmatically control
       replication and using DAO to control the rest of the Jet database
       engine. Developers who use DAO to control replication must follow
       the same licensing guidelines described above.

14. Q. How are the licensing guidelines different for the Microsoft
       Replication Manager?

    A. All Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit licensing terms applies to
       Microsoft Replication Manager with the following differences:

       1. Microsoft Replication Manager does not have to be distributed as
          part of a custom solution. Microsoft Replication Manager may be
          distributed on a standalone basis to any desktop that has a copy
          of the Jet database engine. A valid desktop would have Microsoft
          Access, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Visual Basic, or Microsoft
          Visual C++. Any desktop which has a solution built using
          Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, Microsoft Visual Basic, or
          Microsoft Visual C++ also qualifies.

       2. Microsoft Replication Manager product support is paid-only
          support under Microsoft Technical Support policies. This
          support is for the licensed owners of the Microsoft Access
          Developer's Toolkit. Users who receive Microsoft Replication
          Manager from a Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit licensee are
          not covered under this support plan.
