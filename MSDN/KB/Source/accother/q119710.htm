The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
To have the full functionality of the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit
(ADT), such as creating distribution disks for shipping your custom
database application, you must have a local installation of Microsoft
Access version 2.0. There is no way to work around this requirement.
<P>
This means that you cannot perform an administrative installation of
Microsoft Access to a server (with the SETUP /A command), perform
workstation installations of Microsoft Access from the server, and then
install and use the ADT on the workstations. The ADT does not work
correctly with workstation installations of Microsoft Access; a local
installation of Microsoft Access is required.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This requirement is the first item listed in the "Errata and Omissions in
Advanced Topics" section of the README.TXT file that is shipped with the
ADT.
<P>
Although there are methods of working around this requirement, these
methods are not recommended because they create more problems than they
solve. One reason for this is that the ADT Setup Wizard is written to look
for specific files in specific locations, and a local installation of
Microsoft Access puts the proper files in the proper places.
<P>
The ADT will work with a Typical, Custom/Complete, or Laptop local
installation of Microsoft Access. Which local installation option you
choose should be determined by your development environment and which
tools you need for developing your application. For example, if you are
using ISAM drivers in your database application, you should choose the
Complete installation option when you install Microsoft Access.
