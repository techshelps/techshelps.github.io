<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
The Data Outline control included with the Microsoft Access Developer's
Toolkit version 2.0 and 7.0 is not included with the Microsoft Office 97
Developer Edition Tools. However, you can obtain version 1.2 of the Data
Outline ActiveX control for Microsoft Access 97 free from Microsoft's
download services.
<P>
This article discusses the following topics related to using version 1.2 of
the Data Outline control:

<LI>Getting help with the Data Outline Control
<LI>Distributing the Data Outline Control with Run-Time Applications
<P>
</UL>For information about obtaining version 1.2 of the Data Outline ActiveX
control, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : ACC97: Access 97 Data Outline ActiveX Control Available on
               MSL

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>When to Use the Data Outline Control</h3>
 
<P>
Version 1.2 of the Data Outline control is the same as version 1.1 of the
Data Outline control, which is included with the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit version 7.0. The only difference between the two
controls is that version 1.2 has been modified for use in a Microsoft
Access 97 database. There are no feature enhancements or fixes included
with the new control.
<P>
Version 1.2 of the Data Outline control was created to make it easier for
you to upgrade databases in Microsoft Access 97 that contain the Data
Outline control. Although you can add the new Data Outline control to a
form in Microsoft Access 97, consider using another control, such as the
TreeView control, for any new development. Microsoft Access will not
provide an updated Data Outline control for future releases.
<P>
For information about migrating to the TreeView control from the Data
Outline control, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : ACC97: Migrating from Data Outline Control to TreeView
               Control

</PRE><h3>Getting Help With the Data Outline Control</h3>
 
<P>
Version 1.2 of the Data Outline ActiveX control is provided, as is, from
Microsoft's download services; Microsoft Technical Support does not provide
assistance beyond helping you to install the updated control. However,
there are other sources of help for using the Data Outline control:

<UL><LI>The Msdboutl.hlp Help file included with the Microsoft Access
   Developer's Toolkit version 7.0 contains information about version 1.1
   of the Data Outline control, its properties and methods. Because version
   1.2 of the Data Outline Control is the same control updated for
   Microsoft Access 97, the Msdboutl.hlp Help file applies to it as well.

<LI>When you download the new control, it includes a sample database called
   Outlin97.mdb. This is a Microsoft Access 97 database containing sample
   forms that use version 1.2 of the Data Outline Control in different
   ways. You can study the design of those forms to see how to use the
   control in your database.
<P>
   NOTE: Outlin97.mdb contains tables linked to the Northwind sample
   database. You must have Northwind.mdb on your hard drive to use
   Outlin97.mdb. If Northwind.mdb is in a folder other than the default
   Samples folder on your computer, you may receive the following error
   when you open Outlin97.mdb:
<P>
<P><PRE>      You can't run Outline.MDB until you locate Northwind.mdb
</PRE><P>
   If that happens, open the database again while holding down the SHIFT
   key to disable the AutoExec macro. Delete the following linked tables,
   and manually link them with the tables in your Microsoft Access 97 copy
   of the Northwind sample database:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Customers
      Employees
      Order Details
      Orders
      Products
      Shippers
      Suppliers
</PRE>
<LI>If you have the Control Wizards button clicked on the toolbar when you
   add the new Data Outline Control to a form in Design view, the Data
   Outline Control Wizard helps to guide you through creating the levels in
   the control.
<P>
</UL><h3>Distributing the Data Outline Control with Run-Time Applications</h3>
 
<P>
When you download version 1.2 of the Data Outline control, the compressed
file contains updated support files that you need to include when you
distribute a run-time application using the Microsoft Office 97 Developer
Edition (ODE).
<P>
When you add version 1.2 of the Data Outline control (Msdbout2.ocx) to the
List of Files box in the ODE Setup Wizard, you receive the following
message:
<P>
<PRE>   The Setup Wizard could not find the Dependency (.DEP) file for the
   ActiveX control 'msdbout2.ocx'. If this control requires additional
   files to be installed, the control may not register or function
   properly.

</PRE>Be sure you also add the following support files to the List Of Files box
to distribute with your run-time application:
<P>
<PRE>   Mfc40.dll
   Msvcirt.dll
   Msvcrt40.dll
