The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
The Setup Wizard included with the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit
(ADT) version 2.0 does not enable you to create Compact and Repair icons
for a custom application. This article describes two methods you can use
to create Compact and Repair icons for a custom application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup Wizard allows only one set of parameters for a custom
application. In almost all cases, the parameters are used to launch the
custom application, and therefore cannot be used for a Compact or Repair
icon. If you add the /compact and /repair parameters, the Setup Wizard
ignores them.
<P>
The following two methods describe how to work around this behavior.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Method 1 is the only method in this article that is supported by
Microsoft Product Support Services.
<P>
For information about how to create additional program groups and items
with the Setup Wizard, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCOTHER/Q119724.htm">Q119724</A></B>
   TITLE     : ADT2: Creating Additional ADT Application Programs Groups,
               Items

</PRE><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: ANY USE BY YOU OF METHOD 2 IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides
this information "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or
implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of
merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose.
<P>
Edit the SETUP.STF file on Disk 1 of the installation disks created by the
Setup Wizard to create Compact and Repair icons. Follow these steps to use
this method:

<OL><P><LI>Make a backup copy of the SETUP.STF file on Disk 1 of the installation
   disks created by the Setup Wizard.

<P><LI>Open the SETUP.STF file in a spreadsheet application, such as Microsoft
   Excel.

<P><LI>Near the bottom of the file, locate the text "AddProgManItem" in
   column E.

<P><LI>Create a new line by increasing the Object ID counter in column A by
   one. Leave column B blank.

<P><LI>In column C, add the label "USER_UserPM_x" (without the quotation
   marks) where x is one greater than any other USER_UserPM_y label above.
   Leave column D blank.

<P><LI>In column E, enter the text "AddProgManItem" (without quotation marks).

<P><LI>In column F, add the /compact and /repair parameters. The second entry
   is the icon description, and must be changed to something other than
   the original entry (you cannot have two icons with the same
   description). The third entry is the command-line parameter for the
   icon (this is where you add the /compact and /repair parameters). The
   following line is an example of a valid line in column F.
<P>
   NOTE: In the following sample line, an underscore (_) at the end of a
   line is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore
   from the end of the line when re-creating this line.
<P>
<P><PRE>      "My Application Group", "MyApp Maintenance", "%26\msarn200.exe _
      %321\myapp.mdb /ini %323\myapp.ini /compact /repair", _
      "%322\myapp.ico"
</PRE>
<P><LI>Find the label "---- User ProgMan Items ----" in column C. In that
   row, in column F, add the Object ID number for the new line you
   created to the end of the list of Object ID numbers.

<P><LI>In cell B16, increase the Maximum Object ID variable by one. Save and
   then close the SETUP.STF file.
