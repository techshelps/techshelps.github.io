The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you try to start a run-time copy of the Wrkgadm.exe file from a custom
shortcut on a computer that previously had Microsoft Office 97 Professional
Edition installed, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't open registry database

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The registry entry for the shortcut that opened the Wrkgadm.exe file was
removed when the copy of Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition was
uninstalled from the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Rerun Setup for the custom Setup program that created the shortcut to
reregister the entry.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a custom application that includes a copy of the Wrkgadm.exe
   file that comes with Microsoft Access and a custom .mdw file that you
   have created.
<P>
   NOTE: Do not try to use the same copy of the Wrkgadm.exe file that is
   being used by Microsoft Access or the Setup Wizard will fail when it
   tries to use the file.

<P><LI>Create a shortcut that will open the Wrkgadm.exe file.

<P><LI>Run Setup to install your newly created run-time application on a
   computer that does not have Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition
   installed.

<P><LI>Start the Wrkgadm.exe file from the newly created shortcut.

<P><LI>Run Setup for Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition to install it.

<P><LI>After Setup is finished, run Setup again to completely remove Microsoft
   Office 97 Professional Edition.

   receive the error message mentioned in the "Symptoms" section.
