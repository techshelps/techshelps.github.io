<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article discusses issues you need to address when you redistribute a
split database application with the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition
Tools (ODE) or Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT) version 7.0
tools. It addresses these topics:

<UL><LI>What Is a Split Database Application?
<LI>Creating the Setup Files
<LI>Refreshing Linked Tables
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>What Is a Split Database Application?</h3>
 
<P>
A split database consists of two database files. One database (called the
back-end database) contains only the tables and relationships and resides
on a network file server. The other database (referred to as the front-end
database) contains all the other database objects: queries, forms, reports,
macros and modules and resides on each user's computer.
<P>
A split database design works well in multiuser environments, and it offers
these advantages:

<UL><LI>Performance is improved because the application portion of the
   database, the user interface, is on the user's local hard disk.

<LI>Network traffic is reduced because only the data travels over the
   network; all other objects in the database are local.

<LI>Updating your application is easier. You can make design changes to the
   front-end database, and then distribute the changes to users without
   changing any of the data in the back-end database.

<LI>In non-runtime environments, users can create their own custom objects,
   such as queries, forms, or reports, without affecting other users.
<P>
</UL>After you develop your application, you can manually create the back-end
database, export the tables into it, and then link them back to your front-
end database, or you can use the Database Splitter Wizard in Microsoft
Access to automatically do the work for you.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating the Setup Files</h3>
 
<P>
When you distribute a split database application, create two separate
collections of setup files: one setup for the front-end database and all of
its support files, and one setup for the back-end database that contains
only that file and, optionally, a Readme file.
<P>
The setup for your back-end database does not need to include any
shortcuts, registry values, or additional components. However, the Setup
Wizard will automatically include Microsoft Access setup files,
approximately 2 MB total, and those files will be installed on the file
server along with your back-end database.
<P>
When you distribute your application, instruct a network or system
administrator to run the Setup program for your back-end database on the
network file server first. Also provide instructions for setting the
correct permissions for the folder where the data resides, such as Read,
Write, Create, and Delete. You can include those and other instructions in
a Readme file, and include the Readme file as part of the setup for your
back-end database.
<P>
After Setup install the appropriate files on the file server, instruct all
users to run the setup program for your front-end database. This setup
program sets up your main application and all of the Microsoft Access run-
time files on each user's computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Refreshing Linked Tables</h3>
 
<P>
After you set up the back-end database on a network file server, you may
need to provide a mechanism in your front-end database to refresh the
linked table connections. In fact, it is a good idea to run a Visual Basic
procedure each time the front-end database opens to verify that the table
links are valid, and to refresh them if they are not. This can prevent
potential problems if a user moves the back-end database to another
location, or if the user's local computer is incorrectly mapped to the
network server.
<P>
The Developer Solutions sample application (Solutions.mdb) included with
Microsoft Access contains a module called modRefreshTableLinks (or
RefreshTableLinks in version 7.0) that you can use as a basis for writing
your own Visual Basic procedure to refresh your table links. You can
execute the procedure in the OnLoad event of your Startup form, or in an
AutoExec macro in your application, so that table links are verified or
refreshed each time your application is started.
<P>
For more information about customizing modRefreshTableLinks to use in your
own application, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : ADT/ODE: How to Modify RefreshTableLinks Module in
               Solutions.mdb

</PRE>NOTE: If you can emulate the network topology that your application's users
will have, you do not have to refresh the table links in your application
(front-end) database. For example, if you know your data (back-end)
database will reside on G:\MyAppFolder, where G: is a mapped network drive,
you can map a drive the same way in your development environment, and place
the back-end database in G:\MyAppFolder. Then, when you distribute your
application, each table's Connect property will already contain the correct
path to the back-end database. However, because you cannot control whether
users move the back-end database to another location or how each user will
map their network drives, you should include a procedure to refresh table
links in all your split database applications.
