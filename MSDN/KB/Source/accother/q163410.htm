<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
There may be times you want to create run-time applications that include
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, or
Microsoft Word documents using the ODE Setup Wizard. This article
demonstrates how to create custom applications that you can distribute to
other users who don't have Microsoft Excel, Word, or PowerPoint on their
computers. One way this can be done is by adding the application's viewer
files to the Setup Wizard program when you are creating your distribution
disks.
<P>
NOTE: Using the methods described in this article, your users will only be
able to view your Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, or
PowerPoint presentations. They will not be able to make any modifications
to the files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create a custom application that you can distribute to other users,
include the correct viewer files for the particular application in the ODE
Setup Wizard. The files you will need to add to the Setup wizard depends on
the types of files you want to distribute.
<P>
For example, if you want to distribute Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, you
will need to obtain the files for the Microsoft Excel Viewer. The
Microsoft Excel viewer enables users to view Microsoft Excel spreadsheets
without having Microsoft Excel on their computers. This viewer is
available on the Microsoft web at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/excel/Internet/Viewer/">http://www.microsoft.com/excel/Internet/Viewer/.</A></B>

</PRE>If you want to distribute PowerPoint presentations or Word documents, you
can obtain the Word and PowerPoint viewers from the ValuPack folder that
is included in the Microsoft Office 97, Professional Edition package. The
viewer files are in the subfolder Ppt4view for the PowerPoint files and
Wordview for the Word files.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Distributable Application for Microsoft Excel Files</h3>
 
<P>
To create a distributable custom Setup program for your Microsoft Excel
spreadsheets, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Download the Microsoft Excel Viewer files from the Microsoft Web Site at
   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/excel/Internet/Viewer/">http://www.microsoft.com/excel/Internet/Viewer/.</A></B> The file to download is
   XLVWRUS.EXE.

<P><LI>After you have run the setup file XLVWRUS.EXE to install the Microsoft
   Excel viewer on your computer, start the ODE Setup Wizard program.

<P><LI>In the ODE Setup wizard, on the Add files screen, add the following
   files and any Microsoft Excel spreadsheet files you want to distribute
   to the List Of Files box:

    - XLKEY32.DLL
    - XLVIEW.EXE
    - XLVIEW1.REG
    - XLVIEW2.REG
    - XLVIEW3.REG
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: These files can be found in the folder where you installed the
   Microsoft Excel viewer files.

<P><LI>Select XLVIEW.EXE in the List Of Files box, and then click to select the
   "Set as Application's Main File" check box. Click Next.

<P><LI>On the Add Shortcuts screen, click Add, and then type a description
   for your shortcut in the Description box. Leave the default "I would
   like to use a wizard-provided command line" option selected on the
   General Shortcut Properties tab. Click Next three times.

<P><LI>In the "What is the name of your application" box, type the name you
   want to give to your new Microsoft Excel viewer application. Fill in the
   rest of the information as needed for your particular application. Click
   Next twice.

<P><LI>On the screen marked "Where do you want the Setup Wizard to copy the
   files for your custom Setup program," accept the default for the folder
   your disk images will be copied to in the "The Setup Wizard creates a
   folder for each of your disk images within the folder you specify" box.

<P><LI>Select the option for the type(s) of distribution disks you want to
   create. Click Finish.
<P>
</OL>At this point, the ODE Setup Wizard creates the disk images for your
