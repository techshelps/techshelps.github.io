<PRE>1. Q. Can I include the OLE custom controls that come with the
      Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT) with my application?

   A. You can include the three OLE custom controls that come with
      the ADT (the Calendar, Scroll Bar, and Data Outline controls)
      with your application, royalty-free.

2. Q. What is the best way to distribute updates of my application?

   A. To make updating your application easy, begin by creating your
      application as two databases: one database (Data.mdb) for
      storing the application's data; and the other database
      (Program.mdb) for storing the application's queries, forms,
      reports, macros, and modules. To distribute updates of your
      application, simply distribute a new Program.mdb database. You
      can use this method to update the application without
      disturbing your users' data.

      All the objects in the Program.mdb database should be based on
      attached tables from the Data.mdb database. Note that when you
      create a database with attached tables, the path to the
      attached tables is stored in the database. If the path to the
      attached tables becomes invalid, an error message is displayed
      when the database is opened. For information about verifying
      attachments, see The Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit,
      "Advanced Topics", Chapter 2, "Reconnecting Attached Tables,"
      page 35.

3. Q. How can I prevent users from seeing the code in my application?

   A. You can control what users see by taking the following
      precautions:

       - Use form and report modules.

       - Use forms and macros to control users' movements within your
         application.

       - Secure all the objects in your database.

       - Encrypt your database.

4. Q. How do I include my own System.mda file with my application?

   A. To include your own System.mda file, add your System.mda file
      in the Files To Include box in the Setup Wizard. Setup does not
      overwrite a file named System.mda.

      NOTE: If you do not provide a System.mda file with your run-
      time application, Setup creates a new one.

5. Q. Why can't I gain access to my Calendar control's Font and Color
      properties?

   A. The Oc1016.dll file is not automatically registered in the
      Microsoft Windows Reg.dat file when you install the ADT. The
      Oc1016.dll file must be registered in the Reg.dat file in order
      for you to gain access to the Calendar control's Font and Color
      properties.

      For information about how to register the Oc1016.dll file in
      the Reg.dat file, order item number <B><A HREF="../ACCOTHER/Q115125.htm">Q115125</A></B> by selecting the
      FastTips Technical Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.

6. Q. Can I distribute the Microsoft Access Wizards with my
      application?

   A. You cannot distribute the Microsoft Access Wizards. However, you
      can create and distribute your own Wizards. The ADT includes
      commented Wizard code as a learning aid for creating your own
      Wizards.
