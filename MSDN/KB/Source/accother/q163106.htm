The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
If you are creating a custom Setup program for your application using the
Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE) Setup Wizard, and you
include the ODBC components on the "You may now add redistributable
Microsoft Office, Microsoft Jet, and ODBC components to your custom Setup
program" screen, you must be certain that all the files needed for the
added components are included in the Setup Wizard program.
<P>
This article lists the files that are required by the ODBC Desktop Database
Drivers included in the Microsoft Office 97, Professional Edition. Some
files are included automatically. Some files are required by more than one
component. You must include these files when you run the Microsoft Office
97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE) Setup Wizard if they are not automatically
included.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For certain components that you add to the Setup Wizard program, all
necessary files are added automatically as long as Setup can find them on
your computer. For other components that you add to the Setup Wizard
program, you will need to add the files specific to those components using
the "Add the files that you want your custom Setup program to copy and then
set properties for each file" dialog box.
<P>
For example, if you plan to include the ODBC Support with SQL Server
component in your custom Setup program, the Setup Wizard will automatically
include the files needed for that component to your custom Setup program,
provided the Microsoft SQL Server driver is already installed on your
computer. However, if you include the Microsoft Excel ISAM component in the
Setup Wizard program, you must include the Microsoft Excel files that
appear in the "Files Needed for Distributing ISAM Components" section of
this article to the "Add the files that you want your custom Setup program
to copy and then set properties for each file" dialog box. The Microsoft
Excel ISAM files are not included automatically by the Setup Wizard
program.
<P>
<P><h3>Files Needed For Distributing ODBC Support with SQL Server Components</h3>
 
<P>
The following files are automatically included with your custom Setup
program when you select "ODBC Support with SQL Server" if they can be found
on your computer.
<P>
<PRE>   12520437.cpx     12520850.cpx
   Dbnmpntw.dll     Drvssrvr.hlp
   Ds16gt.dll       Ds32gt.dll

</PRE><h3>Files Needed for Distributing ISAM Components</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Access ISAM driver, Msrd2x32.dll, is automatically included
with your custom setup files; you do not need to add it explicitly when you
add files in the Setup Wizard.
<P>
The following files are specific for each database driver, and you must
include them in the Add Files dialog box of the Setup Wizard if you want to
distribute them with your runtime application.
