The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
You can install and run Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE)
on a computer that has Microsoft Access 97 and Microsoft Internet Explorer
4.0. However, you should be aware of the following issues when you develop
Microsoft Access 97 applications:

<UL><LI>Setup Can't Register Comcat.dll
<LI>Internet Explorer 3.x Breaks When You Install Your Application
<LI>You Can't Install Internet Explorer After Install of ODE Application
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Setup Can't Register Comcat.dll</h3>
 
<P>
When you install your application on a computer that is not running
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Comcat.dll was unable to register itself in the system registry

</PRE>When you click OK, you receive another message:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;App Name&gt; Setup was not completed successfully

</PRE>When you click OK again, the setup of your application quits.
<P>
If you plan to distribute your application so that it can be installed on
computers that are not running Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, run the ODE
Setup Wizard on a computer that does not have Internet Explorer 4.0
installed.
<P>
NOTE: If you build your disk images on a computer that does not have
Internet Explorer 4.0 installed, the setup of your application runs
successfully on a computer that has Internet Explorer 4.0 installed.
<P>

   TITLE     : ODE: Comcat.dll Can't Register If Image Built on IE 4.0
               Computer

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x Breaks When You Install Your Application</h3>
 
<P>
When you build your application on a computer running Microsoft Internet
Explorer 4.0 and then install it on a computer running Internet Explorer
3.x, Internet Explorer 3.x breaks on the target computer. Two of the files
installed with your application are not compatible with Internet Explorer
3.x and must be replaced. Alternatively, you can build your disk images on
a computer that does not have Internet Explorer 4.0 installed as described
in the section "Setup Can't Register Comcat.dll."
<P>
For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCOTHER/Q174508.htm">Q174508</A></B>
   TITLE     : ODE: Run-Time Application Built on IE 4.0 Computer Breaks
               IE 3.x

</PRE><h3>You Can't Install Internet Explorer After Install of ODE Application</h3>
 
<P>
After you install an ODE application that was built on a computer running
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, you are unable to install any version of
Internet Explorer on the target computer. The updated files Urlmon.dll and
Wininet.dll that were installed by your ODE application prevent the
installation of Internet Explorer.
