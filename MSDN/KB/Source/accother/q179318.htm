The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
<LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
Some of the features in the retail version of Microsoft Access are not
available for run-time applications that you create using the Microsoft
Office 97 Developer Edition Tools Setup wizard. For example, you are not
able to redistribute the spelling checker files or the Microsoft Access
wizards with your run-time application. However, there are ways in which
you can simulate the features in Microsoft Office in a run-time
application.
<P>
This article describes how you can simulate Office features in your
run-time application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following list describes features that are disabled in custom
applications that you create using the Setup wizard and how you can
simulate those features.
<P>
<P><h3>Spelling Checker Functionality</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Issue</h3>
 
<P>
You want to add spelling checker functionality to your run-time
application.
<P>
<P><h3>Solution</h3>
 
<P>
You must write a procedure to run the installed spelling checker that is
already on your user's computer or look for a 3rd party add-on that does
spell checking. If Microsoft Word 97 is installed on your user's computer,
you can write a procedure for a command button's OnClick property. For
example, the following sample code is attached to the OnClick property of a
command button on the Employees form. When clicked, it will check the
spelling of the contents of the Notes field:
<P>
<PRE>    Private Sub Command0_Click()

      Me!Notes.SetFocus
      Me!Notes.SelStart = 0
      Me!Notes.SelLength = Len(Me!Notes)
      RunCommand acCmdSpelling

    End Sub

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Access Wizard Functionality</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Issue</h3>
 
<P>
You want to use Microsoft Access wizards in your custom application.
<P>
<P><h3>Solution</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot copy the wizard files directly into a custom application you
create. You can extract the code from the wizard files by opening the
wizard file that contains the code you need and copying and pasting the
code into your application.
<P>
NOTE: In the retail version of Microsoft Access 97, you can't view the
Visual Basic for Applications code for wizards. However, you can download a
special version of the wizards that contains viewable wizard code. For more
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>    ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q151196.htm">Q151196</A></B>
    TITLE     : ACC97: Viewable Wzmain80.mde Code Available

</PRE>For example, if your users need to have the functionality of the Find
Duplicates Query Wizard, you can copy the following code from Wztool80.mde:
<P>
<PRE>   Function Dup_Entry()

       On Error GoTo dup_Entry_Err
       Dim rsStrings As Recordset
       Dim dbCode As Database
       Set dbCode = CodeDb()
       Set rsStrings = dbCode.OpenRecordset("fd_TblStrings", dbOpenTable)
       rsStrings.Index = "PrimaryKey"
       wlib_StartAddin 203, rsStrings, "String"
       wlib_OpenCurrentDb
       DoCmd.OpenForm "fd_FrmMain", , , , , acDialog
   dup_Entry_Exit:
       On Error Resume Next
       rsStrings.Close
       dbCode.Close
       wlib_EndAddin
       wlib_CloseCurrentDb
   Exit Function
   dup_Entry_Err:
       If (Err &lt;&gt; 2501) Then
          wlib_HandleError Err, Error$
       End If
       Resume dup_Entry_Exit
   End Function

</PRE>When you call a procedure in the Wztool80.mde or Wzmain80.mde library
database, the required syntax can vary, depending on if you have a
reference to the library within your database.
<P>
For more information about where to find a specific wizard, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q159367</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC97: Which Wizard Is Where in Microsoft Access 97?

</PRE><h3>Filter-by-form Functionality</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Issue</h3>
 
<P>
You want to use the Filter-by-Form feature in your custom application.
<P>
<P><h3>Solution</h3>
 
<P>
The Filter-by-Form command is disabled in a Microsoft Access 97 run-time
application. You can simulate this feature by using information that can be
found in the Qbf.exe file. This file contains a database, created by Ken
Getz, that demonstrates how to create a custom Filter-by-Form which you can
use in any application, including a run-time application.
<P>
For more information about obtaining this file, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q166634.htm">Q166634</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC97: Filter-by-Form Example for Run-Time Apps Available
               on MSL

</PRE><h3>Office Assistant Functionality</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Issue</h3>
 
<P>
You want to use the Office Assistant object in your custom application.
<P>
<P><h3>Solution</h3>
 
<P>
Only distribute your custom application that includes the Office Assistant
object in environments where the user will have a retail copy of Microsoft
Access. For more information about distributing the Office Assistant,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>    ARTICLE-ID:  <B><A HREF="../ACCOTHER/Q162894.htm">Q162894</A></B>
    TITLE     :  ODE97: Cannot Redistribute Office Assistant w/Runtime App

</PRE><h3>OutputTo Functionality</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Issue</h3>
 
<P>
You want to use the OutputTo functionality in your run-time application,
and be prompted for an output file name.
<P>
<P><h3>Solution</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to prompt the user for a file name, you can use the ShowOpen or
ShowSave methods of the Common Dialog ActiveX control.
<P>
For more information about using the ShowOpen or ShowSave methods in your
run-time application, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q173334.htm">Q173334</A></B>
   TITLE     : ODE97: OutputTo Action Was Canceled Error in Run-time App

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft Word functionality</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Issue</h3>
 
<P>
You want to create run-time applications that include Microsoft Excel
spreadsheets, Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, or Microsoft Word
documents to other users who do not have Microsoft Excel, Word, or
PowerPoint
<P>
<P><h3>Solution</h3>
 
<P>
One way you can do this is by adding the application's viewer files to the
Setup Wizard program when you are creating your distribution disks.
<P>
For more information about adding viewer files to your custom application,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>     ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCOTHER/Q163410.htm">Q163410</A></B>
     TITLE     : ODE97: Creating Run-Time Apps for MS Excel, Word, or
                 PowerPoint

</PRE><h3>Adding Custom Toolbars</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Issue</h3>
 
<P>
You want to create custom toolbars that include commands from the Microsoft
Access built-in toolbar.
<P>
<P><h3>Solution</h3>
 
<P>
Instead of selecting the built-in menus on the Commands tab in the
Customize box, select the commands you want from the individual categories.
For example, if you want to add the File menu commands, select the File
category, and then select the individual commands.
<P>
NOTE: The run-time environment does not show and hide your custom toolbars
as the context changes, so you must manipulate the toolbars in your
application using the ShowToolbar method in the OnActivate and
OnDeactivate properties of your forms and reports.
<P>
<P><h3>Including Help Files</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Issue</h3>
 
<P>
You want to use Microsoft Access Help in your run-time application.
<P>
<P><h3>Solution</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to provide Help for your run-time application, you must create
your own Help file, and then set the AppHelpFile key in the Windows
Registry. Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition includes a Help Workshop
to assist you in creating custom Help files, and the Setup Wizard to assist
you in setting the AppHelpFile registry key when you create your Setup
files.
<P>
For more information about creating your own Help file, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
