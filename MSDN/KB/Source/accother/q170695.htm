The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you try to create the setup disk images for your custom application,
you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Path/File access error

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are five possible causes for this error message:

<UL><LI>You tried to create your disk images on a hard disk that does not
   have enough available disk space.

<LI>You tried to create your disk images on a hard disk for which you don't
   have the proper permissions.

<LI>You tried to create your disk images on a hard disk that was
   compressed with Stacker or some other compression software.

<LI>You chose the Network Setup option in the Setup Wizard and the
   "Hide files of these types" option is selected on the View menu
   in the Windows Explorer.

<LI>You created your disk images using stored compressed files and the
   files are corrupted.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The resolutions for these causes are as follows.
<P>
<P><h3>Not Enough Disk Space</h3>
 
<P>
Free up some disk space and rerun the Setup Wizard.
<P>
<P><h3>Proper Permissions Have Not Been Set</h3>
 
<P>
Check the permissions you have set for the folder you are using to
store your disk images. Make sure you have read/write permissions
for the folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Compression Software Has Been Used on the Computer</h3>
 
<P>
If you used compression software on your hard disk, and you set up
a high compression ratio, the hard disk may show far more free space
than can actually be used. If you are using DoubleSpace, the
compression program that is included with MS-DOS 6.0, you can check
your compression ratio as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Type "dblspace" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt.

<P><LI>On the Drive menu, choose Info. If the compression ratio is set
   larger than the estimated compression ratio, select Ratio and set
   the new estimated compression ratio to match the estimated
   compression ratio. This will give you the most accurate information
   about the amount of actual usable free disk space.
<P>
</OL><h3>Using the Network Setup Option</h3>
 
<P>
When you choose the Network Setup option for your application files
while the Windows Explorer option for hiding files is selected, all of
the files you need for your custom setup program may not be copied to
the folder. If this is the case, you will need to open Windows
Explorer and clear the "Hide files of these types" check box, and then
rerun the Network Setup option in the Setup Wizard.
<P>
<P><h3>Compressed Files Are Corrupted</h3>
 
<P>
If your stored compressed files have somehow become corrupted, you should
completely remove the folder that the compressed files reside in, and then
rerun the Setup Wizard to create a new compressed folder.
