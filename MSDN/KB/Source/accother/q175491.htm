The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates how to create a practice topic file using
Microsoft Word 97, and then shows you how to compile it in Microsoft Help
Workshop.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
These are the steps involved in creating and compiling a topic file. Each
of these steps is fully described in this article.

<OL><P><LI>Create your topic information.

<P><LI>Format your text.

<P><LI>Separate your topics.

<P><LI>Identify your topics so that WinHelp can find them.

<P><LI>Connect your topics.

<P><LI>Add graphics.

<P><LI>Save your topic file.

<P><LI>Compile your topic file in Help Workshop.
<P>
</OL><h3>Create Your Topic Information</h3>
 
<P>
To create your topic information, open Microsoft Word and type the
following information into a new document:
<P>
<PRE>   This is the first topic in my sample topic file. What I type here
   will appear in my sample Help file. I can format the text in my
   topic file in different ways, including italic and bold. I can
   also change the size and color of my text.

   I can provide more information about a word by turning it into a
   pop-up. I can also turn a word into a jump. A jump displays
   another topic when a user clicks it.

   I can add graphics, sounds, and video clips to my sample Help
   file. The following is a graphic that I have added to my Help
   file.

   This is a pop-up. A pop-up is a window that appears on top of a
   window or dialog box.

   This is a jump. When a user clicks a jump, the Help topic that I
   specify is displayed.

</PRE></OL><h3>Format Your Text</h3>
 
<P>
So that you can see how your topic file is affected by text formatting,
make the following changes to your sample text:

<UL><LI>Format the word "italic" using the font style Italic.

<LI>Format the word "bold" using the font style Bold.

<LI>Format the word "size" using the font size 8.

<LI>Format the word "color" using the font color Red.
<P>
</UL><h3>Separate Your Topics</h3>
 
<P>
You separate your topics by inserting a manual page break. To separate your
topics, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Place the insertion point before the words "This is a pop-up," and then
   insert two manual page breaks.

<P><LI>Place the insertion point before the words "This is a jump," and then
   insert a manual page break.
<P>
</OL><h3>Identify Your Topics So That WinHelp Can Find Them</h3>
 
<P>
You identify each topic by assigning a topic ID, which makes it possible
for WinHelp to find them. You assign a topic ID by inserting a footnote in
the topic. To assign IDs to your topics, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Place the insertion point before the words "This is the first."

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Footnote.

<P><LI>In the Footnote And Endnote Box, under Insert, click Footnote, and
   under Numbering, click Custom Mark.

<P><LI>In the Custom Mark text box, type the number sign (#), and then
   click OK.

<P><LI>In the bottom pane of the Footnote window, type "MyTopic" (without the
   quotation marks) to the right of the number sign (#). Click Close.

<P><LI>Place the insertion point before the first words "This is a pop-up."

<P><LI>Follow steps 2-4 above. In the bottom pane of the Footnote window, type
   "MyPopup" (without the quotation marks). Click Close.

<P><LI>Place the insertion point before the words "This is a jump."

<P><LI>Follow steps 2-4 once more. In the bottom pane of the Footnote window,
   type "MyJump" (without the quotation marks). Click Close.
<P>
</OL><h3>Connect Your Topics</h3>
 
<P>
Now that the topic IDs have been assigned, you can create references to the
topics anywhere in your Help files.
<P>
NOTE: In the following steps you will be working with hidden text, so be
sure Word is set to display hidden text. For information about displaying
hidden text in Word, search the Help Index for "hidden text, reviewing."
<P>
To connect your pop-up, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the second paragraph of your first topic, place the insertion point
   directly after the period that follows the words "into a pop-up."

<P><LI>Type the topic ID that you assigned to the pop-up text. This should be
   MyPopup.

<P><LI>Select the characters "pop-up.", and then apply the single-underline
   Font character style.

<P><LI>Select the words "MyPopup", and then apply the Hidden font character
   style.

<P><LI>In the second sentence of the second paragraph of your first topic,
   place the insertion point directly after the period that follows
   the word "jump."

<P><LI>Type the topic ID that you assigned to the jump text. This should be
   MyJump.

<P><LI>Select the following characters "jump." and then apply the double-
   underline font style.

<P><LI>Select the topic ID, MyJump, and then apply the hidden character style.
<P>
   For examples of how jumps and pop-ups should look in your topic
   file, search the Microsoft Help Workshop Help Index for "pop-up
   windows," and then "To create a jump to a topic or pop-up topic."
<P>
</OL><h3>Add Graphics</h3>
 
<P>
Add an illustrative graphic to your Help topic. You can use any bitmap file
that you have on your hard disk. There are sample BMP files in the Windows
folder.

<OL><P><LI>Place the insertion point on the first blank line before the sentence
   "This is a popup."

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, point to Picture, and then click From File.

<P><LI>In the Insert picture box, in the Files Of Type list box, select
   "Windows Bitmap (*.bmp;*.dib;*.rle)". Select any BMP file in the Name
   box, and then click Insert.
<P>
   NOTE: If you are using the Help Workshop application that is included
   in the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE), and you are
   adding bitmaps to your topic file, you will need to download the new
   help compiler from the Microsoft Web site before you can compile the
   file.

   As Type list box, select "Rich Text Format (*.rtf)".
