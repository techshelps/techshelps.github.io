<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article contains helpful hints on how to create and compile your
Windows Help files using the Windows 4.0 Help Compiler that is included in
the Windows Help Workshop. It explains the necessary steps, the tools that
you will need, and some of the problems you may encounter.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows Help files consist of topic files and project files. You can
create your topic files using a word processor, such as Microsoft Word. You
can create your project files using Microsoft Help Workshop. The following
steps are involved in creating your Windows Help file:

<OL><P><LI>Creating Your Topic file in a Word processor.

<P><LI>Creating Your Project file.

<P><LI>Compiling and Viewing Your Windows Help file.

<P><LI>Troubleshooting Problems You Encounter Creating Your Windows Help File.
<P>
</OL><h3>Creating Your Topic file in a Word Processor</h3>
 
<P>
A topic file contains the words and pictures that make up your Help file.
It is usually divided into logical sections, or topics, that users can
search through by clicking hot spots, using keyword searches, or browsing
through the topics.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft Word 97 produces a Rich Text file that is incompatible with
Microsoft Help Compiler 4.0. For more information about this problem,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE>When you create your Windows Help file, remember the following helpful
hints:

<UL><LI>Before you start, take time to plan what you want to accomplish with
   your Windows Help file. Determine the topics you want to include and the
   best place to include them in your application.

<LI>For the sake of simplicity, keep all of the component files for your
   Windows Help file in the same folder on your hard disk. This will
   help eliminate problems you may encounter referencing the files when
   you try to compile or open your Windows Help file.

<LI>Remember to save your topic file in the .rtf format.

<LI>If you are adding pop-up text or jump text in your topic file that will
   be followed by punctuation, be sure to format the punctuation in the
   same way that you format the pop-up or jump.

<LI>If you need to save space, add graphics to a topic file by including a
   bitmap statement.
<P>
</UL>For more information about creating topic files, please see the topic
"Creating Topic Files," in the Help Workshop Help Index.
<P>
For information about creating context-sensitive help for your application,
please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : ADT/ODE: Help Topic Does Not Exist Err Invoking Custom
               Help File

</PRE><h3>Creating Your Project File</h3>
 
<P>
After you have successfully created your topic file, you will need to
create a project file. Project files contain information about the location
of your topic and graphic files. They also contain settings that customize
the way your Help file looks and functions. You can use the Help Workshop
to compile your project file.
<P>
For information about using the Help Workshop for compiling your project
file, please see the topic "Creating a Project File" in the Help Workshop
Help Index.
<P>
NOTE: If you use the Training cards on the Help Menu for assistance in
creating a project in the Help Workshop, when you get to the last card, the
Close button will not dismiss the Final Training card. You must manually
close the card by click the Close button in the upper-right corner of the
window or by pressing ALT+F4 on the keyboard.
<P>
<P><h3>Compiling and Viewing Your Windows Help File</h3>
 
<P>
Once you have created your project file, you can compile and view your Help
file in Help Workshop. To compile your Help file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Compile.

<P><LI>In the "Compile a Help File" dialog box, select your project file in
   the Project File list box. If your project file does not appear in
   this list box, click the Browse button to search for it.

<P><LI>When your project file is displayed in the Project File list box, click
   Compile.

<P><LI>If Help Workshop reports any errors while compiling the topic file,
   you will need to check your topic file and project file for
   errors. Help Workshop stores error messages in the MyHelp.err file.
   When your Windows Help file compiles without errors, it is ready to
   be distributed with your application.
<P>
</OL><h3>Troubleshooting Problems You Encounter Creating Your Windows Help File</h3>
 
<P>
The following section describes problems you may encounter while creating
and compiling your Windows Help file and offers suggestions on how to solve
them.

<UL><LI>Your Help file does not reflect the change you made in a topic file.
<P>
   You did not save your topic file before compiling. Save your topic
   file and compile again.

<LI>There are other Help files on your computer with the same name.
<P>
   Check for duplicate versions of your Help file in different folders
   or directories on your computer. Delete or rename all duplicates.

<LI>Bulleted and numbered lists do not look right on screen.
<P>
   If you are using Microsoft Word to create your topic file, use the
   Bullets or Numbering buttons on the Formatting toolbar. If you are
   using another word processing program, you should check that
   application's documentation for instructions about creating bulleted
   or numbered lists.
<P>
   If you want to create lists with hanging indents, but do not want to
   use your word processing program's commands for automatically creating
   them, you must set a tab stop on the first line, even with the hanging
   indent. Otherwise the first line will not tab correctly between the
   bullet or number and the text.

<LI>Characters in Help appear different than in your topic file.
<P>
   You may be using a font in your topic file that is not available on
   the computer you are using to view the Windows Help file. WinhHelp will
   substitute the font with a Windows 95 font if your font is not on the
   computer. To ensure that the characters match on screen and in the
   topic file, follow these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Use only fonts supplied with Windows 95.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       Windows 95 automatically installs the following TrueType fonts:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - Arial
        - Times New Roman
        - Courier
        - Symbol
        - Wingdings

       Windows 95 automatically installs the following Raster fonts:

        - MS Serif
        - System
        - MS Sans Serif
        - Terminal
        - Courier

    b. Create a bitmap representation of characters that are not
       supported by the Windows 95 font character sets, and insert the
       bitmap(s) in your topic.

    c. Install the necessary fonts with your Windows Help file.

       WARNING: Fonts are legally protected by trademarks, patents, and
       copyrights. You must obtain the necessary legal rights from the
       font developer before distributing fonts.

</PRE><LI>The punctuation mark immediately follows a hot spot.
<P>
   Make the punctuation part of the hot spot. Place the punctuation mark
   after the hot-spot text and before the instructions.

<LI>The punctuation mark is in a line of text.
<P>
   Rewrite the line to lengthen or shorten the sentence or phrase when
   this occurs. If this occurs frequently in your Windows Help file, you
   should increase the width of the window in Help Workshop. However, be
   aware that this might not eliminate all of the breaks, and in some
   cases, it might introduce new ones at different places in the Windows
   Help file.

<LI>A paragraph in your Help file will not wrap.
<P>
   This will happen if you have text in a table in your topic file. Text
   in a table is designed not to wrap when the window is narrower than the
   width of the table. If you want to leave the text in a table, try one
   of the following methods:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Adjust the window size in the project file by using Help Workshop.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Adjust the width of the table in the topic file, so that it fits
      within the window.
</PRE><P>
   This behavior will also occur if you have the Keep Lines Together
   feature set in Microsoft Word.
<P>
   If you are using this feature in Microsoft Word you should turn it
   off by doing as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. Place the insertion point in the paragraph.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. On the Format menu, click Paragraph.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    3. On the Lines and Page Breaks tab, clear the Keep Lines Together
       check box.
</PRE>
<LI>Text appears over the graphic instead of below or beside it.
<P>
   The text and graphics are in a line of text. If your graphic is taller
   than the line spacing for the line of text it is in, then the text
   might wrap around to the next line over the graphic. To work around
   this behavior, in your topic file, increase the line spacing for the
   paragraph containing the graphic until the entire graphic is showing,
   or decrease the height of the graphic.

<LI>Both text and graphics are in the same table.
<P>
   This can be caused by having a background bitmap in your topic file.
   Background bitmaps are graphics you place in a topic file to appear
   behind the text. If the graphics take up more space than they should
   they will spill over into the space reserved for the text. To fix this
   problem you can increase the width of the table column that contains
   the graphic.

<LI>Graphics in the text interfere with line spacing.
<P>
   This can be caused by graphics that are much taller than the line
   spacing of the text they are in. To ensure that your graphics do not
   interfere with line spacing, do one of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Use a graphics program to decrease the height of the graphic to the
      same height as the line spacing.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Place the graphic on the first line of text in a paragraph if there
      is more space between the paragraphs than between the sentences.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Remove the graphic from the line of text and place it in its own
      paragraph.
</PRE>
<LI>The top of the graphic is cut off.
<P>
   This can be caused by your graphic being taller than your line spacing
   and the height of the line spacing being locked by your topic file.
   This can be corrected in your word processor by increasing the line
   spacing for the paragraph containing the graphic until the entire
   graphic is showing.

<LI>Colors in a graphic do not look like the original.
<P>
   This can be caused by the screen resolution on the computer you are
   installing your Help file on not matching the screen resolution of the
   computer on which the Help file was created. To accommodate different
   color depths on different computers, create a separate version of each
   bitmap for each color depth, and then specify each version in a bitmap
   statement. For more information about doing this, see Microsoft Windows
   95 Help Authoring Kit, Chapter 6, "Working with Text, Graphics, and
   Video."

<LI>A bitmap statement appears in your Windows Help file instead of a
   graphic.
<P>
   This will happen in any of the following situations:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - The bitmap does not exist.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - The bitmap is not in the folder specified by the project file.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - The bitmap name is misspelled.
</PRE><P>
   To correct this problem, do the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. Open the project file, and then click Bitmaps.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. Make sure the correct folders for the bitmap locations are
       specified in the project file.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    3. Check the bitmap locations in Windows Explorer or My Computer.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    4. Check the spelling for the bitmap file name.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    5. Check the syntax for the bitmap statement. One or both of the braces
       ({}) might be missing, or parentheses (()) or square brackets ([])
       were used instead of curly braces.
