The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT) Setup Wizard
to create a custom Setup program, you may encounter one of the following
problems:

<UL><LI>The Setup Wizard (SETUPWIZ.MDB) does not create your distribution
   disks and you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      convertReference: Unable to find
</PRE>
<LI>The Setup program (SETUP.EXE) does not install your application and
   you receive the following three consecutive error messages:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Bad Setup version field.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Processing Top Level information failed.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Setup was not completed successfully.
</PRE>
<LI>The Setup program (SETUP.EXE) truncates the bottom line of your
   application name in the "Welcome to" information that appears on the
   first Setup screen.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In the Setup Wizard's "What is the name of your application?" box, you
included an exclamation point (!), a quotation mark ("), or a comma (,),
or your application name is approximately 30 characters long. The Setup
Wizard does not alert you that you are entering invalid characters or that
your application name may be truncated.
<P>
NOTE: Although the application name can be up to 30 characters long, when
the application is set up on a computer (computer 1) whose font size is
larger than the font size of the computer (computer 2) on which the
application was created, or if the monitor resolution of computer 1 is
lower than the monitor resolution of computer 2, the application name may
be truncated.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, in the Setup Wizard, enter an application name
with fewer characters or enter an application name that does not contain
invalid characters. A valid application name can be up to approximately 30
characters long (see the note in the "Cause" section) and can consist
of letters, numbers, and all punctuation marks except the exclamation point
(!), the comma (,) and the quotation mark (").
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access version
2.0. This problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Access for Windows 95
version 7.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
