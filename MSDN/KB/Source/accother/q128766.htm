The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you install a custom application created with the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit (ADT) on a workstation, you may receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   An error has occurred at changing workgroup database.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Another user is using the system database (SYSTEM.MDA) for the custom
application.
<P>
Each time the custom application is set up on a workstation, the Setup
program tries to create the shared system database on the network server.
<P>
If one user is running the application and a second user tries to install
it, Setup cannot recreate the SYSTEM.MDA file, and the second user receives
the error message.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior no longer occurs in Microsoft Access for Windows 95
version 7.0.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can prevent Setup from creating the SYSTEM.MDA file after the first
workstation installation is completed by modifying the SETUP.STF file on
the network server as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Make a backup copy of the SETUP.STF file located in the shared
    directory of the administrator's installation on the network server,
    and name the backup copy SETUPSTF.BAK.

<P><LI>Open the SETUP.STF file on the network server using an application
    (such as Microsoft Excel) that supports a delimited-text file format.

<P><LI>In first column of the SETUP.STF file, scroll down to the row that
    contains ObjID. Note that the ObjID row contains column headings. Three
    of these column headings (ObjID [column 1], Title [column 3], and
    Object Data [column 6]) are referenced in steps 4 through 10.

<P><LI>In the ObjID row, go to the Title column (column 3).

<P><LI>In the Title column, scroll down to the row that contains "Create
    SYSTEM.MDA." This row is usually located near the bottom of the
    SETUP.STF file.

<P><LI>In the Create SYSTEM.MDA row, go to the ObjID column (column 1), and
    write down the ObjID value.

<P><LI>Go to the Title column (column 3), and scroll to the row that contains
    "User Non File Work."

<P><LI>In the User Non File Work row, go to the Object Data column (column
    6), and delete the ObjID value that you wrote down in step 6.

<P><LI>Go to the Title column (column 3), and scroll up to the row that
    contains "&amp;Complete." This row is usually located near the top of the
    SETUP.STF file.

<P><LI>In the &amp;Complete row, go to Object Data column (column 6), and add the
    ObjID value that you wrote down in step 6.

<P><LI>Save the SETUP.STF file as a delimited-text file.
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>

For more information about modifying the SETUP.STF file for multiuser
applications, see the topic "Setting Up Shared Applications on a Network"
in the README.TXT file located in the Microsoft Access\ADT subdirectory.
