<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
This article discusses some of the issues to consider when you distribute
a run-time application.
<P>
These issues are discussed in general terms, and may not apply to your
particular situation; also, there may be issues you need to consider in
your own situation that are not mentioned in this article. The purpose of
this article is to present tips for successfully deploying your application
and implementing an upgrade strategy.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Developing a well thought-out plan for distributing or upgrading your run-
time application is arguably the most important step toward a successful
deployment of the application. When you create your distribution plan,
consider the following topics.
<P>
<P><h3>Testing</h3>
 
<P>
In general, the more time you allow for the testing phase of your
application, the better your finished product will be. Consider these
issues when you create a plan to test your application:

<UL><LI>Develop a systematic plan for testing each feature of the upgraded
   application.

<LI>If possible, emulate the production environment in your test
   environment so you can test the application in a user environment.

<LI>Enlist assistance from users when testing your application; the way you
   perform a task in the application may be different from the way a user
   will do it.

<LI>Try to stress test the application with multiple users before you
   distribute the upgrade so you can resolve any performance or locking
   issues that arise.

<LI>Arrange to conduct pilot tests of your Setup program in a production
   environment to be sure the application can be installed smoothly.
<P>
</UL><h3>User Environment</h3>
 
<P>
Consider the production environment in which you will set up your
application:

<UL><LI>Make sure all of your users have the minimum required software and
   hardware to run your application.

<LI>Notify users of the installation in advance, so they are aware of it
   and are expecting it.

<LI>Time the installation so it does not add unnecessary stress by
   conflicting with other user activities, such as end-of-month
   responsibilities.
<P>
</UL><h3>Upgrading an Existing Application</h3>
 
<P>
Following are some general considerations when you are ready to upgrade
your application.

<UL><LI>Always create a current backup of the existing application before you
   upgrade.

<LI>Microsoft Access converts most databases without difficulty; however,
   be sure to allow time to resolve unexpected issues that may arise when
   you convert your database.

<LI>If all users will not upgrade at the same time, devise a systematic
   strategy for distributing the upgrade.

<LI>If users need additional training, schedule the training to coincide
   with the distribution of the upgrade.

<LI>If possible, plan for someone to be on site when you first distribute
   the upgrade so you can address any setup issues that arise.
<P>

application in Microsoft Access 97, please see the following article in
