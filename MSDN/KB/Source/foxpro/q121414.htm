The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5x, 2.6a
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Defining a window to be a proportionate size of another window does not
work the same way in FoxPro for Macintosh and FoxPro for Windows. Although
it works as expected in FoxPro for Windows, trial and error may be the only
way to accomplish this in FoxPro for Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To illustrate the differences between platforms, run the following sample
program. This program can be run on both the Windows and Macintosh
platforms. On the Windows platform, the child windows will be one-fourth
the size of the parent window. On the Macintosh platform, they will be
somewhat larger than one-fourth the size of the parent window.
<P>
<PRE>   ZOOM WINDOW SCREEN MAX
   IF _MAC
     SET MACDESKTOP OFF
   ENDIF
   MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN FONT "FoxFont",9
   DEFINE WINDOW A FROM 0,0 TO SROWS()*.8,SCOLS()*.8 ;
     FONT "FoxFont",9 FLOAT TITLE "A"
   ACTIVATE WINDOW A
   DEFINE WINDOW B FROM 0,0 TO WROWS("A")*.5,WCOLS("A")*.5 ;
     FONT "FoxFont", 9 IN WINDOW A FLOAT TITLE "B"
   ACTIVATE WINDOW B
   DEFINE WINDOW C FROM WROWS("A")*.5,0 TO WROWS("A"),WCOLS("A")*.5 ;
     FONT "FoxFont",9 IN WINDOW A FLOAT TITLE "C"
   ACTIVATE WINDOW C

</PRE>The SROWS() and SCOLS() functions return the number of rows and columns
available in the main FoxPro window. Window A in the above program is
defined to be 80 percent of the size of the main FoxPro window.
<P>
The WROWS() and WCOLS() functions return the number of rows and columns in
a specified window. In the above program, the specified window is window A.
Windows B and C are defined to be one-fourth the size of window A, window B
being in the top-left quadrant of window A and window C being in the bottom-
left quadrant of window A.
<P>
All windows are defined with FoxFont, 9-point size, which is a fixed space
font that is available on both platforms. On the Macintosh platform,
MACDESKTOP is set to OFF so the windows will reside on the main FoxPro
window rather than the Macintosh desktop.
<P>
The easiest way to check the size of the child windows in relation to the
parent window is to grab the title bar of window C and move it while
holding down the (left) mouse button. The dotted line will show the new
position; the original position will not change until the mouse button is
released. In FoxPro for Windows, the child windows will be one-fourth the
size of the parent window.
<P>
You can also place the following commands in the Debug window to see the
numbers behind the window sizes. SYSMETRIC(9) returns the height of the
window title, in pixels. FONTMETRIC(1,"FoxFont",9) returns the character
height in pixels.
<P>
<PRE>   Function                         Windows                 Macintosh
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

   WROWS("A")                        27.833                   39.111
   WROWS("B")                        12.250                   19.667
   WROWS("C")                        12.250                   19.667
   SYSMETRIC(9)                      20                       18*
   FONTMETRIC(1,"FoxFont",9)         12                       9*

</PRE>* These are the values returned in FoxPro 2.6a for Macintosh. In FoxPro
<PRE>  2.5c, they are 1 and 9 respectively.

</PRE>The WCOLS() function for the windows could also be used, but the WROWS()
function better illustrates the situation.
<P>
In FoxPro for Windows, the WROWS("A") value can be reconciled by adding the
WROWS() function for windows B and C, along with the height of the title
bar for each window (20 pixels/12 pixels per column*2 = 3.334):
<P>
<PRE>   12.250+12.250+3.334=27.833 (with minor rounding differences)

</PRE>The same is not true on the Macintosh platform. The sum of just the
values returned for WROWS() for windows B and C is greater than
WROWS("A"):
<P>
<PRE>   19.667+19.667=39.334
