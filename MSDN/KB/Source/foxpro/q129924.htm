<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The speed of the USE command in opening a table depends on whether the
table is opened in exclusive or shared mode.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a table is opened with the USE command, a certain amount of data is
read into FoxPro's internal buffers from the physical .DBF file. The amount
of this data is influenced by the mode in which the file is opened. If the
file is opened for exclusive use, more data is read into the buffers than
if the file is opened for shared use.
<P>
A table is opened for exclusive use when the USE command is used to open
the table without the optional SHARE clause and when SET EXCLUSIVE is ON. A
table is opened for shared use when the SHARE clause of the USE command is
included or when SET EXCLUSIVE is OFF.
<P>
As the amount of time required to open a table is partly a function of the
amount of data read into FoxPro's buffers, it usually takes less time to
open a table for shared use and more time to open a table for exclusive
use.
<P>
Under normal circumstances, the time difference is not discernible. Under
certain circumstances, however, this distinction may produce a discernible
difference in performance. For example, if the table resides on a remote
computer that is connected to the client computer through a slow WAN (wide
area network) or modem connection and a large number of tables are opened
with the USE command, the time required to open the files for shared use is
likely to be discernibly shorter than the time required to open the files
for exclusive use.
