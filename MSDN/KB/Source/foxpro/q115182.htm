The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The FoxPro for Windows and FoxPro for Macintosh configuration manuals
incorrectly recommend removing virtual memory if your system has more than
4 megabytes (MB) of random access memory (RAM). Furthermore, the FoxPro for
Windows configuration manual incorrectly recommends creating a 2-MB swap
file if your system has 4 MB of RAM.
<P>
Following these recommendations may prevent your system from running FoxPro
or other applications due to insufficient memory.
<P>
In general, it is best to have as much virtual memory as required to run
all of your applications, provided you have sufficient hard disk space to
support that amount of virtual memory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Virtual memory is free disk space that is used to simulate additional
memory. When the system runs low on available physical RAM, it uses an
algorithm to swap code and data from physical RAM to the hard disk.
<P>
The benefit of virtual memory support is that you can run more programs
than can be supported by actual physical RAM. The drawbacks are the disk
space requirement for the virtual memory swap file and a decrease in
overall execution speed when swapping is required. However, it's generally
better to be able to run a program slowly in a virtual memory system than
not to be able to run it at all.
<P>
NOTE: Simply enabling virtual memory does not degrade system performance.
Code and data are not swapped to the hard disk unless there is insufficient
physical RAM.
<P>
For more information about using virtual memory and swap files in Windows,
query on the following words in the Windows section of the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   windows and swap and file and virtual and memory

</PRE>NOTE: In the FoxPro for Windows "Installation and Configuration" manual,
the note at the bottom of page 3-3 says:
<P>
<PRE>   If you do need a swap file, make sure you create a permanent swap
   file rather than a temporary swap file.

</PRE>This information is true for performance reasons only. However, if you need
virtual memory but cannot use a permanent swap file because of system-
compatibility problems or a lack of hard-disk space, you can use a
temporary swap file instead.
