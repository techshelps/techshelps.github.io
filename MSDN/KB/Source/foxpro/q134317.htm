The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Running setup on any 16-bit Windows platform (such as Windows 3.1 or
Windows for Workgroups 3.11), from distribution disks that were created
with the Setup Wizard, generates the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Bad Source File value in INF File Description line

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error is caused by including files (or a single file) that have long
file names for distribution. If the executable was developed on a platform
that supports long file names, such as Windows 95 or Windows NT, it is
fairly common to include files with the application that take advantage of
the long file name capabilities of the operating system.
<P>
When the Setup Wizard creates the INF file that will be used in setting up
the application, the long file names are written into the INF file
description entries. When setup is run on a Windows platform that does not
support long file names, the setup program does not know how to interpret
these files, and the error occurs. After the error, a message is displayed
stating that setup was unsuccessful.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this error when installing an application on Windows platforms
that do not support long file names, ensure that all files included for
distribution adhere to the MS-DOS 8.3 file-naming conventions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create an application in Visual FoxPro on Windows 95 or Windows NT.

<P><LI>Include a file that has a long file name.

<P><LI>Run the Setup Wizard to create distribution disks.

<P><LI>After the disks have been created, try and run setup on a Windows
   platform that does not support long file names. The error will occur
   when setup is run.
