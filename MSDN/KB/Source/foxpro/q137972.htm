The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot configuration problems effectively, you need to know which
files Visual FoxPro looks at when it starts up and what information those
files contain. That information is given in this article and in the Visual
FoxPro Help file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Foxpro.ini</h3>
 
<P>
The Foxpro.ini file is located in the Windows directory and contains the
information for the main FoxPro window. It is saved each time you exit
Visual FoxPro, so when it restarts it looks the way it did when you closed
it.
<P>
<P><h3>Config.fpw</h3>
 
<P>
The Config.fpw file contains optional settings you can make to your
environment. It is located in the Visual FoxPro working directory, unless
otherwise specified with a startup command switch. Many of these are
duplicates of the Registry settings. For more details, please see the Help
file topic on this file.
<P>
<P><h3>Reg.dat</h3>
 
<P>
The registry information is found in Reg.dat. This is where the product
saves the Options dialog box settings. The Options settings are mostly a
subset of the possible Config.fpw settings. The Config.fpw overrides any
Options settings saved to the Registry, which would indicate that the
Config.fpw is opened after the registry. This is an assumption. See the
Help file for information on the Options dialog.
<P>
<P><h3>Foxuser</h3>
 
<P>
The Foxuser file is the generic Resource file. It is Foxuser.dbf by
default, although you can set it to any .dbf file. FoxPro creates it if it
doesn't exist. You can set it ON or OFF. It is mostly a table of
preferences, such as Browse window size, location, and attributes. See the
Help file for more information on the Foxuser.dbf file.
