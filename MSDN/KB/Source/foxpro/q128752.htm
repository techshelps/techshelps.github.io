The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Like FoxPro 2.x, Visual FoxPro provides support for access keys in objects.
In addition to the standard types of access keys for objects, Visual FoxPro
also now supports access keys on Label controls.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Access keys in Visual FoxPro work the same as they did in earlier releases
of FoxPro. An access key combination is defined by including the control
characters 'back slash-left angle bracket' (\&lt;) within the text caption of
the selected object.
<P>
You may be familiar with the use of access keys for an object such as a
FoxPro 2.x push button. Visual FoxPro has extended this ability to include
the Label control as well. In FoxPro 2.x, this functionality was difficult
to achieve and required additional work on the part of the programmer.
<P>
In Visual FoxPro, access keys are added to label controls in the same
manner as you would add one to any other object, such as a push button. It
is important to keep the following key points in mind when using this
functionality:
<P>
- The Label control has a tab index value located under the 'Other' tab of
<PRE>   the Label Properties sheet.

</PRE>- Labels that are assigned an access key value will activate the next
object in  the tab index order. If you have a form that has a label control
with a tab index  value of 2 on it and an access key value of the letter
<PRE>'a' , when the user presses ALT+A,  the object which has tab index value 3
</PRE>will receive focus. In most cases, this would  ordinarily be an object such
as a combo box or text box.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 
<P>
In the ORDENTRY screen of the TASTRADE project, located in the
SAMPLES\MAINSAMP subdirectory of Visual FoxPro, the customer field has an
access key value of C. The tab index order for the Label control is 1. Tab
index 2 is the cboCustomer_Id field, so when ALT+C is pressed, focus moves
to the cboCustomer_Id field. The following procedure shows how to examine
this screen:

<OL><P><LI>Open or switch to Microsoft Visual FoxPro.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open. This invokes the Open dialog box. Under
   the 'List Files of Type' list box, select Project.

<P><LI>Select the MAINSAMP directory as found in \VFP\SAMPLES\MAINSAMP.

<P><LI>Choose the TASTRADE project and click OK.

<P><LI>In the Project Manager, click the plus sign (+) next to the word
   Documents.

<P><LI>Click the plus (+) sign next to the word Forms.

<P><LI>From the list of forms, choose Ordentry.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You should also be aware that access keys can be assigned to numbers
as well as to text. The following Label control caption is activated by
pressing ALT+3:
<P>
<PRE>  Label1.Caption = 'Number \&lt;3'

</PRE></OL>The following Visual FoxPro objects support the use of access keys:
<P>
<PRE>   CheckBox
   CommandButton
   Label
   OptionButton
   Page

</PRE>For objects like CommandGroups and PageFrame pages, you must select the
appropriate object in the group. For example, in a PageFrame, to add an
access key to a caption on a page, you must select the Page 1 object from
the PageFrame. Note that Header objects in a grid don't support access
keys.
<P>
If a user presses an access key combination for an object on a currently
inactive form that is part of a FormSet, the inactive form will be
activated. Pressing hot keys that are independent and separate from any
FormSet will NOT activate the independent form.
<P>
Access keys on menus have not changed in Visual FoxPro. Although you can
define an access key in a menu using by using the control character (\&lt;)
sequence, access keys must still be assigned to menu pads and bars by using
the shortcut option. For the purposes of this document, shortcut key and
access key are used interchangeably. As before, when a menu pad has an
access key defined, you will not see any indicator that an access key has
been assigned unless you specifically add the access or shortcut key
sequence to the pad name.
<P>
Bars under a pad do not have to have the access key sequence assigned to
the pad name. When a shortcut has been defined for a bar as it has been for
the bar named 'A menu bar' below, Visual FoxPro will list the access key
combination next to the pad name.
<P>
Mymenu
<PRE>  A menu bar ALT+A

</PRE>The order of precedence of menus and access keys has also not changed in
Visual FoxPro. When two or more pads share the same access key combination,
such as two pads both with a shortcut of ALT+Q, focus moves to the first
pad by default.
<P>
When a bar in a submenu has the same shortcut key as a menu pad, focus
still moves to the menu pad by default.
<P>
If you do define a shortcut key for a menu bar, you don't have to have any
shortcut key text. Removing the key text will result in a cleaner menu
look. You can then clue the user to the access key by putting the control
key sequence (\&lt;) in front of the letter which defines the access or
shortcut key.
<P>
NOTE: You can also define a number hot key in a menu.
