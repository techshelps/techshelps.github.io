The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are executing an .EXE file created with FoxPro for Windows, the
.EXE file flashes briefly on the screen and then disappears.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The .EXE file may be reading a CONFIG.FPW file that contains a COMMAND=
statement that calls a nonexisting program. The .EXE file will not be able
to locate the program and will terminate.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure the CONFIG.FPW file does not contain such a command.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When developing an .EXE file for distribution, many developers copy the
.EXE and .ESL files into a separate directory in order to test the .EXE
file. When the .EXE file starts up, it acts just like FoxPro and looks for
a CONFIG.FPW file in the .EXE's directory. If it does not find a CONFIG.FPW
file, the .EXE file looks in the directories that are listed in the MS-DOS
PATH statement. When it finds a CONFIG.FPW file, such as the one located in
the FoxPro directory, it runs the commands in that file. If a COMMAND= line
is in the CONFIG.FPW file and it issues a DO command to run a program, the
.EXE file tries to run that program. If the .EXE file cannot find the
program, the .EXE file terminates as if a QUIT command were issued.
