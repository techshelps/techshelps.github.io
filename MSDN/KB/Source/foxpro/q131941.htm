The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Class Browser (Browser.app) displays only the methods, properties, and
members that were added directly to the class. What you do not see are any
methods, properties, or members that the class inherited from a parent
class.
<P>
For example, you create a text box class &lt;parent class&gt; and add a new
method to the class. Then you creast a new class based on &lt;parent class&gt;
and a method is added to this &lt;subclass&gt;. In the properties sheet under the
Method tab, you can see that the inherited method from the &lt;parent class&gt;
is shown with the method added in the &lt;subclass&gt;. However, when you run the
Class Browser and select the &lt;subclass&gt;, the Class Browser displays only
the method added directly to the &lt;subclass&gt;.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. The class browser only shows members of the
immediate class, not of any parent classes.
<P>
There are two reasons for this:

<UL><LI>It would be difficult, slow, and possibly problematic to open every
   associated .VCX file of all parent classes when scrolling through the
   class list to find all the inherited methods.

<LI>The inherited members can be displayed in the Class Designer by using
   either the Properties sheet or the Class Info dialog box.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a class called testparent based on a text box, and store the
   class in Test.vcx.

<P><LI>Add a new method to the testparent class called test1. Save the class
   by clicking Save on the File menu.

<P><LI>Create a new class called testsub based on testparent, and store the new
   class in Test.vcx.

<P><LI>Add a new method to the testsub class called test2. Save the class by
   clicking Save on the File menu.

<P><LI>Open the Properties sheet with testsub open, and click the Method tab.
   Look at the bottom of the method list to verify the existence of two
   additional methods (test1 and test2).

<P><LI>Close the Class Designer, and start the Class Browser.

<P><LI>Open the Test.vcx library when prompted.

<P><LI>Click the testsub class in the class hierarchy tree.

<P><LI>In the list under the All tab, the only item showing is 'm  ~ test2'.
   If it is not showing, make sure the Empty button is depressed. The
   testsub class did inherit the test1 method but it is not displayed in
   the Class Browser.
