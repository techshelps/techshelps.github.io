The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5 and 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When FoxPro for Windows is installed, it makes changes to the Windows
operating system. Changes are made to the WIN.INI and REG.DAT files, and
some dynamic-link library (DLL) files are added to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
subdirectory. An MSAPPS subdirectory is also added under the WINDOWS
directory. This directory is added only if another Windows-based
application has not previously created it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The changes described above are conditional. If another Windows-based
application, such as Microsoft Word for Windows or Microsoft Excel, has
already been installed, changes to these three areas have already been
made.
<P>
NOTE: When you install FoxPro for Windows on a network, you need complete
rights to the WINDOWS directory so that the .DLL files can be updated and
the MSAPPS directory added, if necessary.
<P>
WIN.INI: These lines are added to the WIN.INI file if they have not
previously been added by another application:
<P>
<PRE>   [MSAPPS]
   msapps=C:\WINDOWS\msapps

   [MS Proofing Tools]
   Custom Dict 1=C:\WINDOWS\msapps\proof\custom.dic
   Spelling 2057,0=C:\WINDOWS\msapps\proof\msspell.dll,C:\WINDOWS\msapps\
      proof\mssp_br.lex
   Spelling 1033,0=C:\WINDOWS\msapps\proof\msspell.dll,C:\WINDOWS\msapps\
      proof\mssp_am.lex

     NOTE: The WINDOWS directory name and the numbers after the word
    "Spelling" sometimes may be different, as Windows appears to
     choose this number randomly.

</PRE>REG.DAT: The line "MICROSOFT GRAPH" is added to the REG.DAT file if no
other Windows-based application has added it. This line is visible
only if REGEDIT.EXE is executed to access the REG.DAT file.
<P>
MSAPPS: This directory is placed under the WINDOWS directory if it
does not already exist. MSAPPS has two subdirectories named MSGRAPH
and PROOF. These are the directories and the files in them:
<P>
<PRE>   MSGRAPH
      GRAPH.EXE
      MSGRAPH.HLP
   PROOF
      CUSTOM.DIC
      MSSPELL.DLL
      MSSP_AM.LEX
      MSSP_BR.LEX

</PRE>.DLL Files: The .DLL files listed below are added to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
subdirectory by FoxPro if they do not exist previously. If some of
these files do exist, VER.DLL will check to see if they are the most
current files. If they are not the latest, the most current file will
be copied.
<P>
<PRE>   COMMDLG.DLL              SHELL.DLL
   DDEML.DLL                TOOLHELP.DLL
   OLECLI.DLL               VER.DLL
   OLESVR.DLL
</PRE>
