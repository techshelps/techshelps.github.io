The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Using FoxPro version 2.x for Windows, you can control the color of screens
by using the Screen Layout dialog box, and you can control the color of GET
objects interactively from the Object menu. This article describes how
user-defined colors set in the Screen Builder are converted when a FoxPro
version 2.x screen is ported to a Visual FoxPro version 3.0 form.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In FoxPro version 2.x for MS-DOS, you can change the color of GET objects
by choosing Color from the Screen menu. The dialog box allows you to
control the color schemes used with GET fields and the color pairs used
with SAY fields. On the other hand, the screen interface for FoxPro for
Windows and FoxPro for Macintosh version 2.x allows the manipulation of
color pairs, as opposed to color scheme, for each GET object.
<P>
The Converter is a tool that allows you to transport your version 2.x
projects, screens, and reports to Visual FoxPro projects, forms, and
reports. A converted form emulates a READ and this implementation uses form
sets, forms, and page frames. You can either perform a visual or a
functional conversion. This article explores functional conversion only.
For more information about converting your application, search for
"Converting" in the Visual FoxPro Help menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Color Properties Exposed in a Visual FoxPro Form</h3>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro exposes several properties to customize the colors of
controls and forms. The BackColor, ForeColor, DisabledBackColor, and
DisabledForeColor properties specify the background and foreground colors
used to display text and graphics. They correspond to the concept of color
pairs (background and foreground). For a list of controls that use these
properties, search for "ForeColor" or any other property in the Visual
FoxPro Help menu.
<P>
The ColorSource property determines how a control's colors are set. When it
is set to 2, the ColorScheme property specifies the color scheme used with
the control. These properties are used by a converted form.
<P>
<P><h3>Conversion of Form Colors</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro for MS-DOS does not provide an interactive way to control the
background color of the screen. In FoxPro version 2.x for Windows and
FoxPro for Macintosh, if you modify the background color of a window, the
BACKCOLOR and FILLCOLOR properties of the new form are set to the colors
you specify. If you did not alter the color of the screen, the Visual
FoxPro form uses the Windows Background color set in the Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Conversion Control Colors</h3>
 
<P>
The color of GET objects created in a FoxPro for Windows or FoxPro for
Macintosh screen is converted as follows:

<UL><LI>The information selected as FillColor in a version 2.x screen is stored
   in the BackColor property.

<LI>The information selected as PenColor in a version 2.x screen is stored
   in the ForeColor property.

<LI>The COLORSCHEME property is set to 3-Default Scheme.
<P>
</UL>It is not possible to customize the color of command buttons.
<P>
The Converter does not convert the color of GET objects from screens that
were created in FoxPro for MS-DOS.
<P>
To edit the color of the converted objects, modify the BackColor and
ForeColor properties. If you prefer to use color schemes, you can set the
ColorSource property to 2-ColorSchemePropertyScheme, and then set the
ColorScheme property to the user-defined schemes. Use the following syntax
to define color schemes:
<P>
<PRE>   SET COLOR OF SCHEME &lt;n&gt; to &lt;10 color pairs&gt;

</PRE><h3>Conversion of READ COLOR Clause</h3>
 
<P>
The READ COLOR clause is not converted from a version 2.x screen to a
Visual FoxPro form. To obtain the effect provided by a READ COLOR, you can
set the ForeColor and BackColor properties of the active control in the
GotFocus event handler, and change it back in the LostFocus event handler.
