The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The FCREATE() low level file function is used to create a text file that
doesn't have a file extension of .TXT. The Icon for the text file is just a
document, not a document with a FoxPro head on it. Get Info on the file
shows that it is a FoxPro file however. If the file is opened in a resource
editor, such as ResEdit, the Creator is FOXX but the Type is ????.
<P>
If the text file is created with a file extension of .TXT, it will have an
icon of a document with a FoxPro head on it. A resource editor will show
the Type as TEXT.
<P>
Customers have reported that not having a Type of TEXT has been known to
cause problems with certain software packages that use the text file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro for Macintosh looks at file extensions when assigning Creator Types
to files. The .TXT extension along with the .FPM extension on the
CONFIG.FPM file are the only file extensions that get assigned a Creator
Type of TEXT. See page 402 of the Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh
"Developer's Guide" for a listing of File Types and Extensions. If you have
Visual FoxPro for Macintosh version 3.0, search for File Extensions in the
on-line Help.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Create the text file with a .TXT file extension, and then use the RENAME
command to change the extension. See the sample code in the "Steps to
Reproduce Behavior" section of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Put the following code in a new program file and run it.
<P>
   x=FCREATE("test.xxx")
   =FPUTS(x,"Hello")
   =FPUTS(x,"Goodbye")
   =FCLOSE(x)

<P><LI>Go to Finder and look at the icon of test.xxx. It should just be a
   document. If a resource editor is available, use it to check the Creator
   and Type of the file. The Type should show up as ????.

<P><LI>Put the following code in a new program file and run it.
<P>
   x=FCREATE("test.txt")
   =FPUTS(x,"Hello")
   =FPUTS(x,"Goodbye")
   =FCLOSE(x)
   RENAME "test.txt" TO "test.xxx"

<P><LI>Go to Finder and look at the icon of test.xxx. It should now be a
   document with a FoxPro head on it. If a resource editor is available,
   use it to check the Creator and Type of the file. The Type should show
   up as TEXT.
<P>
</OL>Note that the FxSetType() function in the FOXTOOLS.MLB (FOXTOOLS.CFM or
FOXTOOLS.SLM with Visual FoxPro for Macintosh) library will not change the
creator type to TEXT.
<P>
Rebuilding the desktop on the Macintosh should not undo the Type after the
file extension is changed with the RENAME command. However, it may be a
good idea to avoid doing this until the text file has been used for its
purpose.
