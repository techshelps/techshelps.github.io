<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The FoxPro wizards and Catalog Manager cannot be copied or distributed. The
wizards and Catalog Manager are governed by the terms of the "Microsoft
License Agreement" that is included with all Microsoft FoxPro version 2.6
for Windows and Microsoft FoxPro version 2.6 for MS-DOS.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The wizards and Catalog Manager are provided with both the Standard Edition
and Professional Edition of FoxPro version 2.6 for Windows and FoxPro
version 2.6 for MS-DOS. The wizards and Catalog Manager are considered to
be part of FoxPro.
<P>
If an application is written in FoxPro and that application is distributed
by providing source code or compiled code, using the run-time modules,
building an .EXE file, or by any other means, the application must not
include any of the wizard or Catalog Manager files. The list of files
that can be distributed when the Distribution Kit is included in the
"User's Guide" for the Distribution Kit. It is a violation of the Microsoft
License Agreement to obtain or distribute any of the wizards or the Catalog

in the Microsoft License Agreement.
