The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The SS Tab control is very similar to the PageFrame control, although there
are some important differences. Some properties of the SS Tab control
cannot be accessed at design time but can be changed at run time.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The PageFrame control has a separate property sheet for each page. The SS
Tab control has only one property sheet. If different tabs are selected,
the Tab property changes number. At run time the different tabs may be
accessed by setting the tab number as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   * OleControl1 is the default name of the control.
   ThisForm.OleControl1.Object.Tab = 1

</PRE>There is a Picture property that cannot be accessed via a property sheet.
If the property is double-clicked, a dialog box appears but a picture
cannot be selected. A picture can be assigned to a tab at run time by using
the LoadPicture function. Pictures cannot be assigned to pages of a
PageFrame.
<P>
The following code placed in the Init event of the form assigns the Fox.bmp
to the tab area of the second tab. Tabs are numbered starting with 0
(zero):
<P>
<PRE>   * The name of the control was changed to sstab.
   ThisForm.sstab.Object.Tab = 1
   ThisForm.sstab.Object.Picture = LoadPicture("c:\vfp5.0\fox.bmp")

</PRE>One reason you may want to use the SS tab control instead of the PageFrame
is the TabOrientation property. The tabs of the SS tab control can be
placed at the bottom, or on the left or right sides.
<P>
Like the PageFrame the tabs can spread across the entire length of the
object or can be shortened. The Style property offers two choices: Windows
95 or Microsoft Office. These are the equivalent of the PageFrame choices
of unjustified or justified under the TabStyle property. If you choose
Windows 95 for the SS Tab control, the tab strip area not occupied by a
tabs has the same BackColor as the control instead of the BackColor of the
form. This looks messy, but you can change it easily by issuing the
following command in the Init of the form. (The BackColor of form is
assumed to be green here.)
<P>
<PRE>   ThisForm.sstab.Object.BackColor = RGB(0,255,0)

</PRE>The BackColor of the SS Tab control is not available at design time.
<P>
Each of the pages within a PageFrame control has its own setting for
BackColor and ForeColor, so they can be set individually. BackColor and
ForeColor in the SS Tab control apply to the whole control and cannot be
set individually for the separate tabs. ForeColor, like BackColor is not
available at design time.
