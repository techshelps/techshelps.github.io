The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual FoxPro Report Designer has been updated to include many new
features. These new features can be incorporated into new reports created
in Visual FoxPro as well as into reports created in any previous version of
FoxPro.
<P>
The following new features have been added to the Visual FoxPro Report
Designer:

<UL><LI>Private data session
<LI>Drag and drop
<LI>On Entry and On Exit report band expressions
<LI>System toolbars
<LI>Report output to an ASCII text file
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Private Data Session</h3>
 
<P>
By choosing Private Data Session from the Report menu, you can initialize a
separate record pointer for the databases used in the report. This feature
allows the report to be called from a form or program without affecting the
record pointer for that session.
<P>
<P><h3>Drag and Drop</h3>
 
<P>
As with many other areas of the Visual FoxPro interface, the Report
Designer now supports drag and drop. Fields or entire tables can be dragged
from the data environment and dropped on the appropriate band on the report
to create the report expressions. Likewise, fields or tables can be dragged
from the Project Manager to achieve the same results.
<P>
<P><h3>On Entry and On Exit Report Band Expressions</h3>
 
<P>
The report band expressions provide a way to call a user-defined function
at a specific time while the report is running. There is an On Entry and an
On Exit band expression for each band in the report. Each expression is
called once for every page in the report. As expected, the On Entry
executes as the report processing enters a particular band while the On
Exit executes as the report processing leaves a particular band. The band
expressions for a given report band can be accessed by double-clicking the
desired band.
<P>
<P><h3>System Toolbars</h3>
 
<P>
The Visual FoxPro Report Designer uses several system toolbars for creating
reports. There are four system toolbars that relate to the Report Designer.

<UL><LI>The Report Designer toolbar helps you to create data groupings quickly
   and access the other three toolbars (Report Controls, Layout, and Color
   Palette).

<LI>The Report Controls toolbar gives you quick access to the various
   controls that can be added to a report.

<LI>The Layout toolbar enables you to adjust the layout of the various
   objects on the report. You can use it to center, align, and size the
   objects.

<LI>The Print Preview toolbar helps you navigate through the pages of a
   report while previewing the report.
<P>
</UL>These toolbars can be activated and deactivated by choosing Toolbars from
the View menu or by right-clicking any of the system toolbars.
<P>
<P><h3>Report Output to an ASCII text file</h3>
 
<P>
The REPORT FORM command has been updated to include a new ASCII clause.
This clause, used with the TO FILE clause, can be added to the report
command to send the output to an ASCII text file devoid of printer-specific
control codes or escape sequences. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   REPORT FORM MYREPORT.FRX TO FILE MYFILE.TXT ASCII
</PRE>
