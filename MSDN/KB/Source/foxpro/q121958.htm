The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6x
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5x, 2.6x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Issuing an @ ... SAY statement whose coordinates are before the coordinates
of a previously issued @ ... SAY statement causes a page to eject when
output is directed to a text file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro cannot issue an @ ... SAY statement to a previous location in a text
file. A file does not act like the screen, which can accept input for any
location. In a text file, the data must be presented sequentially. It is
not possible to move backward in a text file while sending output to it.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Issue the @ ... SAY statements sequentially according to their coordinates.
For example, @ 1,1 SAY 'Name' would come before @ 2,2 SAY 'Phone'.
<P>
To send output to a text file multiple times, (overwriting the file each
time) without issuing any page ejects to the file, include code to capture
or reroute the page eject. To redirect the page eject, use additional SET
DEVICE TO FILE and @ ... SAY statements. The following code sample
demonstrates how to do this.
<P>
<PRE>   SET DEVICE TO FILE myfile.txt
   @ 1,1 SAY "Hello"
   @ 2,2 SAY "Good-bye"
   SET DEVICE TO FILE junkfile.txt
   @ 0,0 SAY "" &amp;&amp; Page eject will precede this @ ... SAY

</PRE>In this example, when @ 0,0 SAY "" is executed, FoxPro checks the previous
@ ... SAY command. Because the value of the previous @ ... SAY is "2,2", a
page eject is sent to JUNKFILE.TXT before @ 0,0 SAY "" is run. If this code
is run a second time, no page eject will be sent to MYFILE.TXT because the
page eject has already been issued, and the coordinates 1,1 come after 0,0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
Run the following code twice (overwriting MYFILE.TXT during the second
run). The second time it is run, a page eject will be issued to MYFILE.TXT.
<P>
<PRE>   SET DEVICE TO FILE myfile.txt
   @ 1,1 SAY "Hello"
   @ 2,2 SAY "Good-bye"
</PRE>
