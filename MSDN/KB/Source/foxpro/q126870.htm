<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Record and file locking behavior is slightly different when transaction
processing is used in Visual FoxPro.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you issue a BEGIN TRANSACTION command, the index of the currently open
table is locked. Only the current user is able to update, add, or delete
records in the table while the transaction is in progress.
<P>
Any command or function that normally places a lock will continue to do so.
Automatic locks are released automatically when the transaction is
completed. Either a ROLLBACK or END TRANSACTION command must be used to end
the transaction. Manual locks - those placed with LOCK(), RLOCK() or
FLOCK() - must be manually released after the transaction is completed.
<P>
This behavior is by design, and is required to ensure the basic
functionality of transaction processing.
<P>
The following coding techniques can be used to minimize contention for
record locks:

<UL><LI>Open all tables before issuing the BEGIN TRANSACTION command. This
   prevents the entire table from being locked as soon as it is opened.

<LI>Buffering should be enabled and all edits performed before the
   transaction starts. The BEGIN TRANSACTION command should be
   issued immediately before a TABLEUPDATE() or a SQLCOMMIT()
   function. Optimistic row buffering provides the shortest locking
   time of all buffering types. However, table buffering must be
   used if you wish to rollback multiple transactions.

<LI>Avoid the use of commands with a FOR scope within the confines of a
   transaction, since these commands lock the entire database. If you must
   use commands such as REPLACE within a transaction, use a SCAN loop to
   perform individual commands instead.

<LI>Close the transaction as soon as possible after the update has been
   applied to the table.
<P>
</UL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information on buffering and transaction processing, refer to the
Microsoft Visual FoxPro "Developers Guide," or to the following commands
and functions in the "Language Reference":
<P>
<PRE>   BEGIN TRANSACTION
   END TRANSACTION
   ROLLBACK
   CURSORSETPROP()
   TABLEUPDATE()
   TABLEREVERT()
   SQLSETPROP()
   SQLCOMMIT()
   SQLROLLBACK()
</PRE>
