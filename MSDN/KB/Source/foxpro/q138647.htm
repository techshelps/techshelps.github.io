The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After a lot of tables are added to a database container, the pictures of
the tables in the database designer window can become overlapped, sometimes
making it look like a table is missing from the database container. Instead
of trying to move each table in the Database Designer, open the database
(.dbc file) as a table, and browse the database to find out if that table
still belongs in the database container. If the table that seems to be
missing in the database is listed here, you can modify the database
container, and move each table to find the hidden table.
<P>
CAUTION: Be careful when renaming or deleting the resource files as
described in the following paragraph; there is other information saved in
these files that Visual FoxPro uses. These files are located in the Vfp
directory by default.
<P>
Another way to find the hidden table is to rename or delete the resource
files: Foxuser.dbf and Foxuser.fpt. The location of where each table is
placed in the database container is stored in these files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select a database container that has several tables in it.

<P><LI>Click and hold the mouse button down on the title of a table, and drag
   the table so that it overlaps another table. Because the underlying
   table can't be seen, a user might think that it has been deleted from
   the database container.

<P><LI>Type CLOSE DATABASE in the Command window to close the database. Type
   the following command in the Command window to open the database
   container as a table:
<P>
   USE &lt;databasename&gt;.DBC

<P><LI>Type BROWSE FOR UPPER(objecttype)='TABLE' in the Command window, and
   note that the fields showing will contain the table names of all the
   tables held in the database container.
<P></OL>
