The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Step 6, the Setup Wizard in Visual FoxPro for Macintosh can hang under
the following circumstances:

<UL><LI>KEYCOMP is either Windows or DOS.

<LI>The drop-down list in the Target Dir column of the grid in Step 6 is
   clicked with the mouse, causing it to stay dropped-down.

<LI>With the list in the dropped-down position, an arrow key on the
   keyboard is pressed in an attempt to select one of the items in the
   list.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure that KEYCOMP is set to Macintosh before running the Setup Wizard.
The following command typed in the Command window can be used to determine
what KEYCOMP is currently set to:
<P>
<PRE>   ? SET("keycomp")

</PRE>This should return "MAC."
<P>
When KEYCOMP is MAC, the Visual FoxPro menus will not have any letters
underlined. When KEYCOMP is DOS or Windows, various letters in the FoxPro
menus will be underlined.
<P>
To set KEYCOMP to Windows, type the following command in the Visual FoxPro
Command window and press the RETURN key:
<P>
<PRE>   SET KEYCOMP TO Windows

</PRE>KEYCOMP can also be set or checked in the Options dialog that is accessed
from the Tools menu. In the General tab, there is a section for Data Entry.
Set the Navigation Keys drop-down to Macintosh Compatible to set KEYCOMP to
Macintosh through this dialog.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The scenario where this problem will likely be encountered is caused by the
behavior of the drop-down list in the grid in Step 6 - File Summary of the
Setup Wizard. When KEYCOMP is Windows or DOS, clicking the drop-down
will cause it to drop down and stay down. Then, if the mouse button is
released and another location in the list is clicked, the list goes back up
but the item clicked isn't selected. At this point, it may be tempting to
use the arrow keys because the mouse does not appear to work. To change the
location in the drop-down list with the mouse, click the drop-down list
and, holding down the mouse button, drag down the list to the item desired.
Then release the mouse button.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps To Reproduce The Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>SET KEYCOMP to Windows using one of the methods described in the
   Workaround section of this article.

<P><LI>Create two folders on the Macintosh: one to contain the program to be
   distributed(source folder) and another for the disk images. The
   desktop is a good location for these folders. Place at least one file
   in the source folder. Any .prg file is fine.

<P><LI>Start the Setup Wizard from the Tools, Wizards menu.

<P><LI>Fill in the appropriate options in Steps 1 through 5.

<P><LI>In Step 6 - File Summary, click on the Target Dir drop-down list in the
   grid. It should drop down. Release the mouse button and the list
   should stay down. Then, use the down arrow key to scroll down the list.
   The Mac should hang at this point.
