The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro Library Construction Kit, version 2.5
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are creating a library using the FoxPro 2.5 Library Construction
Kit (LCK), numerous errors occur during the compiling and linking process.
One of these errors is "Unresolved Reference."
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The error occurs because the C compiler (Microsoft C 7.0 in this case)
cannot find the library, object, or header file that is displayed in the
error.
<P>
For example, the compiler may not be able to find the LIBW.LIB file that is
referenced in the makefile provided with the LCK for use with Microsoft C
7.0. This file, part of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
(SDK), is a library file containing Windows functions that can be called in
a FoxPro for Windows .FLL library. When you are using the Microsoft C 7.0
makefile provided with the LCK to produce an .FLL library, the "Unresolved
Reference" error message will occur if the SDK is not installed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To track down the cause of the "Unresolved Reference" error, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Check for the existence of the file that contains the function or
   library reference that is causing the error.

<P><LI>Check the MS-DOS PATH statement to make sure the file or library
   can be found at compile and link time.

<P><LI>Make sure all MS-DOS SET environment variables needed by the
   compiler are set correctly in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<P><LI>Make sure the filename listed in the makefile is spelled correctly.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A makefile is used to compile and link a C library or executable. As
mentioned above, there is a sample makefile for use with C 7.0 in
conjunction with the LCK to create C libraries to interface with
FoxPro for Windows. The libraries created by the LCK have an extension
of .PLB for FoxPro for MS-DOS and .FLL for FoxPro for Windows.
