The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When installing or reinstalling additional Visual FoxPro components, the
interface presented by the Setup program might seem unfamiliar.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro uses the new Microsoft setup routine found in other Microsoft
products. This setup program allows you to install, maintain and remove the
different components of Visual FoxPro.To install a component of the
product, you need to choose the appropriate check box for that option in
the setup dialog box. If setup is run after the product has been
installed, the setup routine enters a maintenance mode where the dialog box
shows what components are already installed.
<P>
To remove a component, clear the check box for the component. To add a
component, select the check box for the option leaving the other options
alone.
<P>
This may confuse some users who want to reinstall only a single item. For
example, while trying to reinstall the VFP.EXE, you might think that you
need to clear the check boxes for all the other options. But what really
happens is that everything but VFP.EXE and the .DLL filess is un-installed.
The file VFP.EXE is not even reinstalled.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To install an previously uninstalled component, choose the component and
continue with setup. FoxPro installs only that component.
<P>
To reinstall an option that was previously installed, choose one of the
following:

<UL><LI>Run setup and remove the component that needs to be reinstalled. This
   will remove it from the disk and the proper entry from the FOXSET32.STF
   or the FOXSET16.STF file. After removing the option, run setup and
   choose the item to reinstall.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Delete the FOXSET32.STF or FOXSET16.STF file and run setup. When the
   components dialog box appears, none of the items will be checked. Choose
   the item that needs to be reinstalled. The only known drawback to this
   approach is that FoxPro will not know which options have already been
   installed.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
