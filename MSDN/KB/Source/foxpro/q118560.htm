The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Report Writer in FoxPro has limited widow and orphan control. Widows
and orphans occur when a record is split between two pages. For example, if
you have a report that prints out data in such a manner that a record
stretches beyond the bottom of the page, the remainder of the record's data
is printed on the following page. The part that prints on the first page is
the called a widow. The part that prints on the second page is called an
orphan. This is often undesired and potentially confusing behavior.
<P>
While there is little that can be done to prevent the record from being
split, you can have the Report Writer indicate to the reader of the report
that the record has spilled over to the next page. This will at least
lessen the reader's confusion.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To provide this kind of notification, you can create a memory variable that
is changed to a specific value every time a group changes and is reset to a
different value at the end of each group. If the variable is not equal to
the specific value when it is evaluated in the Page Footer band, this means
that the record continues on the next page. In this case, a message such as
"Continued on next page..." will notify the reader that the record
continues on the next page.
<P>
The following steps illustrate this method:

<OL><P><LI>Open a database such as ARTICLE.DBF, which comes with the FoxPro
   Distribution Kit.

<P><LI>Create a quick report.

<P><LI>Create a grouping on ARTICLE.TITLE.

<P><LI>Create a variable called NEWGROUP with an initial value of .F., set
   Value To Store to .T., and select ARTICLE.TITLE for Reset.

<P><LI>Create another variable called COUNT with an initial value of 0, set
   Value To Store to 1, select End Of Report for Reset, and select Count
   under Calculate.

<P><LI>In the Page Footer band of the report, create the following expression:
<P>
<P><PRE>      IIF(!newgroup,"Continued on next page...","")
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the PRINT WHEN clause of this expression, select No for Print
   Repeated Values, and then select the Print Only When Expression Is True
   box. Type the following expression in the Expression Builder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      COUNT &lt; RECCOUNT()
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Report menu, choose Page Preview and examine the bottom of each
   page. Note that the words "Continued on next page..." appear.
<P>
</OL>For information about preventing orphans, please see the following
