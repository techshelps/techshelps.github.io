<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Problems have been reported with garbage characters or with repainting in
FoxPro for UNIX. Both situations described in this article have required
tuning of the Digiboard software in some way.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Problem/Solution 1</h3>
 
<P>
A customer figured out how to stop getting garbage on the screen with a
Wyse60 without running Digiboard's dscreen utility. In the gettydefs file
on the 38400 line, the customer had CTSFLOW and -IXANY. The communications
setup on the terminal setup (press F4 to get to communications setup) had
the following settings:
<P>
<PRE>   Baud Rate=38400         DATA/STOP BITS=8/1
   RCV HNDSHAKE=XON/XOFF   XMT HNDSHAKE=XON/XOFF   XPC HNDSHAKE=OFF

</PRE>The above setup worked with all applications except FoxPro for UNIX running
at 38400. The customer found that by changing RCV HNDSHAKE=XON/XOFF to RCV
HNDSHAKE=DTR, FoxPro would run correctly at 38400. The customer spoke to
Digiboard about dscreen, but Digiboard did not know why FoxPro for UNIX
would work with dscreen. The customer guessed that dscreen was slowing
FoxPro for UNIX down enough to work correctly. The customer could not find
any difference in the settings of the line while running dscreen and not
running dscreen. Digiboard said dscreen does not do anything special
concerning flow control.
<P>
<P><h3>Problem/Solution 2</h3>
 
<P>
Another customer was having a problem with screen repaints and screen
colors in FoxPro for UNIX when using Digiboard's Doubleview. If the
customer turned WRAPAROUND on, FoxPro for UNIX seemed to work correctly,
but other applications, such as WordPerfect Office, would not work
correctly with WRAPAROUND on.
<P>
In this situation, it's important to check the automargin ("am") terminfo
capability. WRAPAROUND=ON is the same as "am"; WRAPAROUND=OFF is the same
as "not am". To check this setting, you have to use the wpterm utility to
look at WordPerfect's terminal facility as well as terminfo.
<P>
In this case, the customer looked in the wpterm program and edited the
dbview and dbviewcol variables. The line "Can Automap be Disabled on this
Terminal?" was set to N. This was right for WordPerfect 5.1 but it was set
to Y for the WordPerfect Office setup. WordPerfect Office and WordPerfect
5.1 are supposed to use the same shared directories. WordPerfect Office
mail was the program that was having problems the WRAPAROUND=ON setting in
the Doubleview setup. To change the Automap setting, the customer ran the
WordPerfect 5.0 wpterm program. The customer now has Doubleview set up with
WRAPAROUND=ON, and the terminal now works correctly with WordPerfect Office
mail and FoxPro for UNIX.
