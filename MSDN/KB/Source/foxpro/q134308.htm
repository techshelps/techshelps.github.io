The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using a report designed with a field, variable, or expression
formatted as uppercase and justified (alligned) either to the right or
center of the area on the page for that field, you may encounter a probem.
Upon clicking the OK button to open and close the report expression dialog
box repeatedly (usually done after previewing or printing the report), you
may see that the field, variable, or expression has been reduced to a
single character; all the characters to the right of the first character
have been truncated. The field, variable, or expression now appears as a
single uppercase character alligned to the right or to the center. The
format picture code character string of "@!J" (without the quotes) is
transposed and enlarged to the string "@J&lt;space&gt;!"
<P>
Each time the Report Expression dialog box is reentered the number of
spaces between the justification code (J for right, I for center) and the
uppercase code (!) is increased by one if the OK button is used to close
the dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
One way to restore the field to the desired format is to delete the format
picture codes from the Format text box in the Report Expression dialog box.
Then click the three-dot button at the right to move to the Format dialog.
Restore the formats by selecting the To Upper Case check box, and the
appropriate justification check box.
<P>
Another way to work around the problem is to delete the space(s) that
appear in the format picture codes string between the justification
character (a J or an I) and the exclamation point that indicates uppercase.
This is the string that appears in the Format text box in the Report
Expression dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in
Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.
