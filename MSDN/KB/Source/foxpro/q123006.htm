The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5 2.5a 2.5b 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Under certain conditions, you may not be able to use ODBC to retrieve
numeric data. Null values are returned when you try to bring numeric data
into a FoxPro cursor or table by using the Lotus Notes ODBC driver to
connect to a Lotus Notes database from FoxPro for Windows. Text and date
data, however, are brought in successfully.
<P>
NOTE: Lotus Notes is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A Lotus Notes numeric data type will be mapped to an ODBC SQL SQL_FLOAT
data type. This is the same data type the SQL Server FLOAT data types are
mapped to and FoxPro is able to successfully bring down FLOAT data from an
SQL Server. This would indicate that FoxPro might be able to bring in
numeric data successfully from Lotus Notes.
<P>
<P><h3>Mapping SQL Tables, Views, and Indexes to and from Notes</h3>
 
<P>
When connecting to a Lotus Notes database, it's helpful to know the
following information:

<UL><LI>Each SQL table is derived from a Notes form.

<LI>Each SQL index is derived from a Notes view. Sorted columns in the Notes
   view map to fields in a single form. A Notes view selects documents from
   that single form.

<LI>Each SQL view is derived from a Notes view that selects documents
   through a single form.
<P>
</UL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Set up the Lotus Notes ODBC driver through ODBC Setup. See the Lotus
   Notes help file for more information.

<P><LI>Using DBConnect (SQLCONNECT in Visual FoxPro), connect to a Lotus Notes
   database (.NSF File) that has a form with a numeric field on it. The
   User identifier and Password may be an empty string (specified by "").

<P><LI>Issue a DBExec from FoxPro(SQLEXEC in Visual FoxPro), passing a simple
   SQL SELECT command to the database file. Notice that the results from
   this command indicate that records have been selected even though the
   command returns an error number of -1. Using DBError (AError in Visual
   FoxPro) returns neither an error number nor an error message.
<P>
</OL>The commands for steps 2 and 3 will be similar to this:
<P>
<PRE>   handle = DBCONNECT("&lt;Data Source Name&gt;","","")
   &amp;&amp; handle = SQLCONNECT("&lt;Data Source Name&gt;","","") in Visual FoxPro
   ?DBEXEC(handle,"&lt;Form Name&gt;")
   &amp;&amp; SQLEXEC((handle,"&lt;Form Name&gt;") in Visual FoxPro

</PRE></OL>&lt;Data Source Name&gt; is specified in the Lotus ODBC Setup and &lt;Form Name&gt;
is a Form that was created inside Lotus Notes. The records will be blank
for the numeric field in the cursor that was returned.
