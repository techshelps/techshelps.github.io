<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This information is also available in FoxPro's online Help files.
<P>
To go directly to this topic, choose the "Tips and Tricks" Help topic. Then
do one of the following, depending on which online Help file is in use:

<UL><LI>FOXHELP.HLP: Choose the "Performance Tips" jump text.
<LI>FOXHELP.DBF: Scroll to the "Performance Tips" heading.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Out-of-Date Index</h3>
 
<P>
If a table/.DBF operation is returning the wrong answer, try recreating the
index in case the index is out-of-date. It is best to re-create an index
instead of using the REINDEX command because REINDEX does not fix a damaged
index file.
<P>
<P><h3>Rebuild .CDX Files</h3>
 
<P>
Occasionally rebuild .CDX files. This can reduce the .CDX file size,
thereby improving performance. When recreating .CDX tags, you should first
remove the tags using the DELETE TAG ALL command.
<P>
<P><h3>Pack Tables and Memo Files</h3>
 
<P>
PACK your tables periodically. This will reduce the size of the tables and
improve performance. Use the PACK MEMO command to reduce size of associated
memo files, especially for tables in which you frequently make changes to
memo fields.
<P>
<P><h3>BROWSE and SCAN Performance</h3>
 
<P>
To enhance the performance of BROWSE or SCAN commands, periodically SORT
tables into the most frequently used order (that is, sort into the order of
the most frequently used index).
<P>
<P><h3>Multi-Table Query Performance</h3>
 
<P>
To enhance multi-table queries, SORT the tables by the join condition.
<P>
<P><h3>Optimizing Queries</h3>
 
<P>
Queries are optimized when the table/.DBF has no order set. Use SET ORDER
TO without a tag name to remove a set order. If you have SET DELETE ON, you
will need a .CDX tag on DELETED() to optimize queries for that table/.DBF.
<P>
<P><h3>Adding Records to a Table</h3>
 
<P>
Use the INSERT - SQL command to add new records to a table/.DBF. This
command provides better performance and greater integrity across a network
than the combination of the APPEND BLANK and REPLACE commands.
<P>
<P><h3>Screen Input/Output</h3>
 
<P>
For best performance, screen input/output in FoxPro for Windows must be
carefully handled. On a typical FoxPro for MS-DOS machine with 25 rows by
80 columns, you have 2000 screen elements to refresh each time. In
Microsoft Windows, the standard VGA setting is 640 x 480 pixels. This
equates to over 300,000 pixels which need to be redrawn each time the
screen is refreshed. Compared to a character monitor, this is about a 150:1
ratio.
<P>
The SHOW GETS command is commonly used to refresh @...GETs on screen when a
change is made. Using SHOW GETS can dramatically impact the performance of
applications using screens with many objects or on slower machines.
Instead, consider using the SHOW GET command to only refresh the @...GET
being modified instead of the entire screen.
<P>
In addition, FoxPro for Windows allows you to create picture buttons and
check boxes by specifying a .BMP file which contains the associated
picture. These types of controls take longer to refresh using SHOW GETS
than normal text prompts.
<P>
<P><h3>Run Fewer Applications</h3>
 
<P>
Reduce the number of applications running in a Windows session. Windows is
a cooperative multitasking environment. The more applications you have
running, the more system resources are diverted from FoxPro.
<P>
<P><h3>Memory Variables</h3>
 
<P>
Use the #DEFINE directive in FoxPro for Windows to significantly reduce the
number of memory variables used in your applications, saving memory.
<P>
<P><h3>Wallpaper Considerations</h3>
 
<P>
If you have limited memory, do not use wallpaper because it requires extra
memory. In addition, it impacts performance whenever the screen is
refreshed.
<P>
<P><h3>Color Considerations</h3>
 
<P>
Using lots of colors in applications requires memory. This is especially
true if you hard-code colors instead of allowing Microsoft Windows color
schemes. When possible, use 16-color .BMP files because they require less
disk space and display well on standard VGA monitors. Unless you need to
use MS-DOS color sets for visual compatibility in cross-platform
applications, you should allow users to choose their own colors using the
Microsoft Windows Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Memory Allocation</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro does not allocate memory for all of its resources when it is
launched. FoxPro windows are allocated from the available memory pool in
Microsoft Windows. Therefore, you should make enough memory available using
the MEMLIMIT setting in your CONFIG.FPW file.
<P>
<P><h3>Memory for FoxPro for MS-DOS</h3>
 
<P>
If you set the KB Desired setting in the PIF file for the FoxPro for MS-DOS
product to -1, Microsoft Windows will give it all the available memory.
Refer to the Microsoft Windows PIF Editor help file for more information.
