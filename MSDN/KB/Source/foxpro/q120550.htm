Part 1:  Notes About FoxPro for Macintosh
 
This section includes information about:

<UL><LI>FoxPro Filename Restrictions
<LI>Printing FoxPro General Fields
<LI>Redirecting Printing to a PostScript File
<LI>Sending a File to a Port
<LI>Changing Paper Sizes for the ImageWriter
<LI>Notes on Using Mail Merge

<P>
</UL> 
FoxPro Filename Restrictions
<P>
Do not use backslashes (\) or quotation marks (") as embedded
characters in folder and filenames. Although the Macintosh accepts
backslashes and quotation marks as valid characters, FoxPro uses these
characters to make filenames compatible across platforms.
<P>
Whenever possible, keep pathnames shorter than 256 characters.
<P>
 
Printing FoxPro General Fields
<P>
When printing general fields using an Apple LaserWriter, "Black &amp;
White" output appears as all black, "Color/Grayscale" output appears
with a gray background, and "Calibrated Color/Grayscale" output (if
using the LaserWriter 8 driver) appears WYSIWYG (that is, as a white
background). For information on how to resolve print output issues,
please read Knowledge Base article <B><A HREF="../FOXPRO/Q117214.htm">Q117214</A></B>. For more information on
accessing KB articles, see Part 4, "Microsoft Knowledge Base."
<P>
 
Redirecting Printing to a PostScript File
<P>
To redirect a printing job from a printer that supports PostScript to
a PostScript file, issue the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   LIST FILE &lt;filename&gt; TO PRINT PROMPT

</PRE>The Print dialog appears with the option to select a PostScript file
as a destination.
<P>
 
Sending a File to a Port
<P>
If you send a text file or a program to a port (COM1 or COM2), you
must save your file with the end-of-file character, Ctrl-Z. This
ensures that FoxPro can find the end of your document. If you do not
include the end-of-file character, FoxPro will not print the last line
of your document. To save the file with the end-of-file character,
check the box labeled "Save Text With Ctrl-Z" in the Edit Preferences
dialog.
<P>
You can print only character-based documents directly to a port. To
print graphics files, such as a FoxPro report, you must use the
printer driver. To reset the printer to use the printer driver
selected with the Macintosh Chooser, issue the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET PRINTER TO

</PRE> 
Changing Paper Sizes for the ImageWriter
<P>
To change paper sizes for an ImageWriter printer, you need to adjust
the FoxPro for Macintosh resource file. Information about paper sizes
is stored in the PREC resource of FoxPro and is accessed through the
Page Setup dialog.
<P>
Custom page sizes are not available with all printer drivers. For
instance, you cannot change the paper size used by a LaserWriter(R).
<P>
To add a custom paper size option to the Page Setup dialog
1. Quit FoxPro for Macintosh.
2. Open FoxPro for Macintosh in a resource editor.
3. Open the PREC resource.
4. Open the ID number 4.
5. In the field labeled "Number of Btns," change the number from 5 to
<PRE>   6.
</PRE>6. In the fields labeled "Btn 6 Height" and "Btn 6 Width," enter the
<PRE>   height and width of the new paper size. Each number represents
   1/120th of an inch. For example, an 8 1/2-by-11-inch paper size
   has a height of 1320 and a width of 1020.
</PRE>7. In the field labeled "Btn 6 Name," add a descriptive name to appear
<PRE>   next to the button.
</PRE>8. Save your changes and exit the resource editor.
<P>
To use the custom paper size option
1. Use the Chooser to select an ImageWriter printer.
2. Start FoxPro.
3. From the File menu, select Page Setup.
4. Choose the custom paper size.
<P>
FoxPro adds a 1/2-inch margin at the top of all documents printed with
an ImageWriter. To remove the margin, check the box labeled "No Gaps
Between Pages" in the Page Setup dialog.
<P>
 
Notes on Using Mail Merge

<UL><LI>To launch Microsoft Word automatically when conducting a mail merge
   in FoxPro, you must have AppleScript installed. AppleScript
   contains the command that launches Microsoft Word.

<LI>If you would like certain words in your mail merge document to
   appear in quotes (for example, Bernard "Buddy" Rich) you must use
   double quotes in your data source file (for example, Bernard
   ""Buddy"" Rich).

<LI>Microsoft Word Mail Merge does not support FoxPro Memo fields. To
   include memo information in the mail merge, copy the memo contents
   to another character field in the table.
<P>
</UL> 
Creating a New Catalog
<P>
When creating a new catalog, don't use quotation marks in the file
name you specify for the new catalog.
<P>
 
Switching from dBASE
<P>
The Switching from dBASE topic in online Help documents the Convert
dBASE Files...
option on the Run menu. This option does not appear on the Run menu in
FoxPro for Macintosh. Use the Catalog Manager to convert dBASE files.
<P>
 
Part 2:  FoxPro and Other Applications
 
<P>
This section includes information about:

<UL><LI>Importing 4th Dimension, FileMaker Pro, Microsoft Works, and
   Microsoft Excel Files
<LI>Changing Color Settings
<LI>Using the QuickTime(TM) Extension
<LI>Using the XCMD Header File
<LI>FoxPro and Gregg's Buttons
<LI>FoxPro and QuickKeys
<LI>FoxPro and the Radius(TM) Pivot Monitor
<LI>FoxPro and Network Systems
<LI>FoxPro and Accelerator Cards
<LI>FoxPro and Fontographer 3.2
<LI>FoxPro and TearOFF Menu Extensions
</UL> 
Importing 4th Dimension, FileMaker Pro, Microsoft Works, and Microsoft
Excel Files
<P>
You can import files created by the following programs to FoxPro for
Macintosh:

<UL><LI>4th Dimension version 3.0
<LI>FileMaker Pro version 2.1
<LI>Microsoft Works 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel 4.0
<P>
</UL>Use the Catalog Manager to import these files or use the FoxPro
application called IMPORT.APP, located in the GOODIES:MISC folder.
<P>
To run IMPORT.APP:
<UL><LI>Choose Do... from the Program menu, then double-click on IMPORT.APP
   in the Open dialog list.
</UL>-OR-
<UL><LI>Issue the following commands in the Command window:
<P>
</UL>SET DEFAULT TO "Macintosh HD:Microsoft FoxPro 2.6:Goodies:Misc"
DO IMPORT.APP
<P>
**Note**
IMPORT.APP does not import the following from 4th Dimension and
FileMaker Pro:
<UL><LI>Fields that contain pictures, QuickTime movies, sounds, or photos.
<LI>Variable length field types (memo type).
</UL> 
Changing Color Settings
<P>
FoxPro for Macintosh supports both black-and-white and color settings.
However, FoxPro for Macintosh does not recognize changes to color
settings made by third-party utilities while FoxPro is running. To
make FoxPro recognize changes in color settings made by third-party
utilities, you must exit and restart FoxPro. This ensures that any
objects you create in FoxPro are saved in the correct color setting.
<P>
 
Using the QuickTime Extension
<P>
You can use the QuickTime extension of Macintosh System 7.1 to access
and control time-based data such as video and audio recordings. FoxPro
for Macintosh uses the latest version of the QuickTime extension,
version 1.6.2. Versions earlier than version 1.6.1 may cause
unexpected results.
<P>
For information about using QuickTime with FoxPro, see the QuickTime
topic in online Help.
<P>
 
Using the XCMD Header File
<P>
To call FoxPro for Macintosh from an XCMD you need to add a reference
to the FoxPro header file to the XCMD, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>    #INCLUDE xcmd.h

</PRE>The FoxPro XCMD header file, XCMD.H, is located in the GOODIES:MISC
folder.
<P>
 
FoxPro and Gregg's Buttons
<P>
Gregg's Buttons modifies the way system dialogs and menus appear.
FoxPro doesn't support most of these modifications.
<P>
 
FoxPro and QuickKeys
<P>
If you are using QuickKeys, pressing F1 does not bring up FoxPro Help.
To bring up the Help file while using QuickKeys, press Command + ? or
type HELP in the Command window.
<P>
 
FoxPro and the Radius Pivot Monitor
<P>
If you are using a Radius Pivot monitor, you must change the
orientation of the monitor before starting FoxPro. The windows and
status bar of FoxPro are not updated properly if you change monitor
orientation while FoxPro is running.
<P>
 
FoxPro and Network Systems
<P>
Some FoxPro users might experience unexpected results when using
unsupported network software to share files. For example:
<P>
On DEC(R) Pathworks(TM) systems, the file locking mechanism is not
synchronized across multiple platforms. If a Windows workstation is
accessing a shared file on the Pathworks server, Macintosh
workstations might receive a "File in use by another" message. This
message doesn't appear if only Macintosh workstations (or only Windows
workstations) are accessing the file.
<P>
On Banyan(R) VINES(R) systems, updating a table with SET EXCLUSIVE OFF
has unpredictable results. Use EXCLUSIVE access to ensure that
updates work.
<P>
In addition, Microsoft Windows NT(TM) Advanced Server users might
notice that tables set as EXCLUSIVE in FoxPro for Macintosh can still
be set as SHARED in FoxPro for Windows. This problem is being
addressed with NT Service Pack 2.
<P>
 
FoxPro and Accelerator Cards
<P>
The following accelerator cards have compatibility issues:

<UL><LI>Mobius Accelerator on SE/30 machines
<LI>Daystar Accelerator Turbo 040 on a IIfx machine
<P>
</UL>Contact your card vendor for additional information.
<P>
 
FoxPro and Fontographer 3.2
<P>
There is an extensions conflict between RESERVED.MLB in FoxPro and
MXText in Fontographer 3.2 that prevents Microsoft Word 5.1a from
printing. To print from Word, either remove RESERVED.MLB and keep
MXText, or remove MXText and keep RESERVED.MLB.
<P>
 
FoxPro and TearOFF Menu Extensions
<P>
It's recommended that you run FoxPro without the TearOFF menu
extensions.
<P>
