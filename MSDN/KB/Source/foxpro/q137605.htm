<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists the viruses that have been detected on hardware after
unsuccessful attempts to install Visual FoxPro. After these viruses were
detected and cleaned from the hard disk, no further problems were
encountered during installation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is important that computer hardware be checked frequently by a virus
detection and cleaning utility. Because the number and signatures of
viruses are always changing, so are the utilities that can successfully
detect and clean them. Microsoft recommends that you consult your local
software retailer for information on the latest and best anti-virus
utilities.
