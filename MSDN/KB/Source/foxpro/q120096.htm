The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows Distribution Kit, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running an .EXE file built with the FoxPro for Windows
Distribution Kit, the .EXE file does not read the FOXPRO.INI file.
<P>
An .EXE file built with the FoxPro Distribution Kit acts like FoxPro does
in several ways. For example, the .EXE file looks for a CONFIG.FPW file in
its own directory. If it isn't found, the .EXE file searches the MS-DOS
search path set in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file just like FoxPro does. In
addition, if the .EXE file does not find a FOXUSER.DBF file, it creates a
new one. However, although FoxPro reads the FOXPRO.INI file located in the
Windows directory, the .EXE file does not.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior becomes a problem if you try to modify the HEIGHT and WIDTH
lines in the FOXPRO.INI file to make the .EXE file appear smaller on screen
than the full desktop. The .EXE file will always come up full screen by
default and will ignore the FOXPRO.INI file.
<P>
There are two ways to work around this problem:

<UL><LI>Include a MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN FROM 0,0 TO 30,60 (change "0,0 TO 30,60"
   to whatever number you want) command as one of the first lines of code
   in the .EXE file. This command will cause the .EXE file to resize itself
   to those coordinates.
<P>
   NOTE: There is no way to make the .EXE file appear other than full
   screen at startup. The MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN command will resize the .EXE
   file only after it has come up full screen.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If a screen is the main program in the project, you can select Desktop
   as the window style in the Screen Layout dialog box. This will cause a
   MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN command to be generated by the screen.
