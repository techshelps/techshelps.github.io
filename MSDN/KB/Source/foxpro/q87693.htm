The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, and 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The printer drivers in a FoxPro for MS-DOS executable (.EXE) file do not
work.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Open the project file and verify that GENPD.APP is included as an
application and marked as excluded. If not, add GENPD.APP to the project as
an application; doing so automatically marks the file for exclusion.
Rebuild the project and the executable file.
<P>
If you are using FoxPro version 2.5 or later for MS-DOS, you must also
distribute DRIVER2.PLB in the same project where you have added GENPD.APP.
The DRIVER2.PLB file is located in the FOXPRO25\GOODIES\PDRIVERS directory.
<P>
NOTE: DRIVER2.PLB should be included in the project, and then marked
excluded. It must also be distributed and put into the same directory as
the .EXE file, along with the GENPD.APP.
<P>
GENPD.APP is automatically excluded if it is correctly included in the
project. It should be included as an application, not as a program, by
using the File Type list box. If GENPD.APP is included as a program, the
error message "Line too long" is displayed when you try to build the
application or executable file.
<P>
Distribute the GENPD.APP, FOXUSER.DBF, FOXUSER.FPT, PROAPI16.EXE,
DRIVER2.PLB, and FOXSWAP.COM files with the executable file. (PROAPI16.EXE
is not needed if you are using FoxPro version 2.5 or later.) Your
application's installation procedure must copy these files into the same
directory as the application.
<P>
