<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can create classes in Visual FoxPro in a program or in the visual
interface. Using the Class Designer to create classes visually produces a
table with a .VCX extension. Although it is not necessary to understand the
ways in which the .VCX tables store metadata, many developers have reasons
for wanting to read and write to these tables. This article shows and
explains the file architecture of a .VCX table.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The VCX table contains information about the objects in classes.

<PRE>Platform    C(8)  WINDOWS            Associates a specific platform
                                     for an object. In single-platform
                                     tables, every object has one record
                                     per platform. Cross-platform objects
                                     have one record per platform with the
                                     same UniqueID and are distinguished by
                                     the Platform field. For records that
                                     do not relate to a specific class or
                                     object, the Platform field contains
                                     the string "COMMENT." The header
                                     record (record #1) has UniqueID =
                                     Class.

UniqueID    C(10) _ QYB0RAW20        Gives unique ID code for individual
                                     classes and objects. Related
                                     cross-platform records share the same
                                     UniqueID value. For records that do
                                     not relate to a specific class or
                                     object, the UniqueID field contains
                                     information that describes the type
                                     of record. The header record
                                     (record #1) has UniqueID = "Class."

TimeStamp   N(10) 495748740          Relates directly to the date and time
                                     the object symbols were created or
                                     last generated. The TimeStamp field
                                     for all records associated with a
                                     class are updated whenever the class
                                     is changed. For records that do not
                                     relate to a specific class or object,
                                     TimeStamp=0.

Class       Memo  mycommandbutton    Defines which class is used to create
                                     the subclass of the class or object
                                     member.

ClassLoc    Memo  tsbase.vcx         Gives relative path and filename of
                                     class defined in the Class field. If
                                     the Class field specifies a Visual
                                     FoxPro built-in base class or the
                                     Class name specified is located in the
                                     same VCX, then the ClassLoc field is
                                     empty.

BaseClass   Memo  commandbutton      Stores the name of the base class, or
                                     topmost parent class in the class tree
                                     hierarchy, of the class or object
                                     member.

ObjName     Memo  cmdCancel          Defines the name of the class or
                                     object member.

Parent      Memo  form1              References the immediate parent
                                     container object that the object is a
                                     member of. If an object member is not
                                     a child member of a container, the
                                     Parent field is empty.

Properties  Memo  Height=22          Lists properties and their set values
                  Width=69           that override the values defined in
                  FontSize=8         the parent class from which a class or
                  Caption="Cancel"   object member is derived.
                  Name="cmdcancel"

Protected   Memo  cAliasdUpdated     Lists all properties and methods that
                                     are marked as protected members for a
                                     class.

Methods     Memo  PROCEDURE Click    Contains all snippet code of a class
                  thisform.Release() or object member.
                  ENDPROC

ObjCode     Memo                     Stores the compiled p-code of source
                                     code stored in the Methods field.
                                     ObjCode is empty if the Methods field
                                     is empty.

Ole         Memo                     Stores binary information for OLE
                                     class and object members.

Ole2        Memo                     Stores binary information for OLE
                                     class and object members.

Reserved1   Memo  Class              Uses Class tag field to indicate the
                                     start of a class definition by storing
                                     the string "Class." If a record is not
                                     the start of a class definition, the
                                     Reserved1 field is empty.

Reserved2   Memo  2                  Stores the number of records
                                     associated with a class, including the
                                     class or container record. This field
                                     only contains a value for the first
                                     record of a class definition. If a
                                     class doesn't contain any object
                                     members, the Reserved2 field for the
                                     record that starts the class
                                     definition contains a 1. For records
                                     that are not the start of a class
                                     definition, the Reserved2 field is
                                     empty.

Reserved3   Memo  cAlias             Lists all user-defined member names of
                  nResultd           a class with the member description
                  Updated            separated by a single space character.
                  cMyProperty        One member is stored with its
                  ^aNames[5]         description per memo line. Standard
                  ^aMyArray[100]     property names are listed without a
                  *Print             preceding character, array properties
                  *SortNames         are preceded with a caret (^), and
                  *MyMethod          method names are preceded with an
                                     asterisk (*).

Reserved4   Memo  bmps\cancel.bmp    Stores the relative path and filename
                                     of the bitmap (.BMP) of a custom class
                                     icon.

Reserved5   Memo  bmps\cancel.bmp    Stores the relative path and filename
                                     of the bitmap (.BMP) for a custom
                                     Project Manager and Class Browser
                                     class icon.

Reserved6   Memo  Pixels             Stores scalemode (Pixels/Foxels) of a
                                     class or object.
