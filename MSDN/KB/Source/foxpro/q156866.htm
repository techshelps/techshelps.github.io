The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When printing a report using Windows 95 only and the REPORT FORM TO
PRINTER PROMPT command, the printed output is reduced down to only one
quarter of the page. This makes the printout very small and difficult to
read. This problem is sometimes reversed and the output is 200-400 percent
larger than expected. This problem has been corrected in Microsoft Visual
FoxPro version 5.0a.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are several scenarios that produce the bug in Windows 95 only. This
is not a problem in Windows NT. The anomaly appears only if printer
drivers are installed in a certain way or if the printer driver cannot
pass the correct information through the printer dialog box.
<P>
It also seems to make a difference if either one of the drivers has been
installed, and deleted, and reinstalled. Depending on which has been
installed makes the other exhibit the bad behavior.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To Fix the Hewlett-Packard (HP) printers' output, use the following steps
if you are having problems:

<OL><P><LI>Uninstall ALL printer drivers.

<P><LI>Reboot.

<P><LI>Install the IIIsi first and overwrite files if prompted.

<P><LI>Reboot.

<P><LI>Install the 4SI. DO NOT over-write the drivers if asked. Take the
   default recommendation. If you overwrite the drivers, you may
   experience the problem.

<P><LI>Reboot
<P>
</OL>This install procedure seems to install the drivers correctly and the
command REPORT FORM TO PRINTER PROMPT works in the HP situation.
<P>
Another possible workaround would be delete the PROMPT clause from the
REPORT FORM command and issue the following commands first.
<P>
<PRE>   SET PRINTER TO
   SET DEVICE TO PRINTER  PROMPT

</PRE></OL>The problem with the above is that the SET PRINTER TO causes a blank sheet
of paper to be ejected.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected
in Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 5.0a.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
Depending on how you installed the drivers, using printer drivers for an
HP LaserJet IIISI and an HP LaserJet 4SI may produce the problem. The
problem can occur under different circumstances, but only one case seems
to always produce the problem.
<P>
All drivers are installed by double-clicking the Printers icon in the
Control Panel while Visual FoxPro 5.0 is not running.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior (on an HP printer)</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Uninstall all Printer drivers. (This does not really delete the
   drivers.)

<P><LI>Reboot. (This is important.)

<P><LI>Install the 4SI driver. (If you have had this previously installed you
   are prompted that the Drivers exists and do you want to overwrite
   them. Choose YES if you are prompted.)

<P><LI>Reboot. (This is important.)

<P><LI>Create and run a simple one line report named "Test.frx" that uses one
   or two fields from \Samples\Tastrade\Data\Customer.dbf
<P>
   To run the report, issue the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      REPORT FORM test TO PRINTER PROMPT
</PRE><P>
   This report should appear fine. (If you previously had the driver
   installed, you may get the problem now.)

<P><LI>Go back to Printers on the Control Panel and install the HP IIISI. When
   asked "Do you want to overwrite the existing drivers?" click Yes.
<P>
   Note that in all cases you are asked if you want to overwrite files.
   Just make sure you install the IIISI after you have installed the 4SI.

<P><LI>Reboot.

<P><LI>Run the same report on both printers.
<P>
</OL>The font size most likely is either much larger or much smaller than
expected on the IIISI. The font size is more often than not much
larger than expected. This sometimes occurs on the 4SI.
