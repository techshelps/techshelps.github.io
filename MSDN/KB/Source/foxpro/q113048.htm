Part 1: Installing the Library Construction Kit
 
To install the Library Construction Kit for Macintosh, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Turn off any virus protection programs.
</OL>2. Insert the disk labeled "Disk 1 - Setup" in the disk drive.
3. Copy the FoxLCK and ASLM Development Tools folders to your hard
<PRE>   disk.
</PRE></OL>4. Copy the UserStartup-LCK file to your MPW folder.
<P>
Sample code is available in the FoxLCK:Source folder for you to use.
<P>
 
Part 2: Additional Information
 
<P>
For the most up-to-date information about Microsoft FoxPro for
Macintosh and other Microsoft products, see the Microsoft Knowledge
Base and the Microsoft Software Library.
<P>
The Microsoft Knowledge Base contains more than 40,000 detailed articles
with technical information about Microsoft products, bug lists, fix lists,
documentation errors, and answers to commonly asked technical questions--
all available through the Microsoft TechNet compact disc, the Microsoft
Developer Network compact disc, and the Internet.
<P>
The Microsoft Software Library is an information resource that can be
accessed through the same sources as the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
This library contains sample programs, device drivers, patches,
software updates, and programming aids. To help you quickly evaluate
choices, a brief text description is displayed when you view each
item.  Additionally, many items have an associated Microsoft Knowledge
Base article that more fully describes the information.

1. Customizing MPW
2. _Alloca() Caution
3. Including PRO_EXT.H
4. Installing .MLB Files
5. Errors While Using _Execute
<P>
 
1. Customizing MPW
<P>
Before you create shared libraries, customize MPW to work with your
source files. You can use the provided example files to test your
changes.
<P>
To customize the example files:
1. Open UserStartup-LCK and change any path references to match your
<PRE>   volume name.
   NOTE Volume names cannot contain spaces.
</PRE>2. To enable these changes, exit MPW, then restart MPW.
3. Set your default directory to &lt;your volume&gt;:FoxLCK:Source:
4. In the Source folder, open Makefile.
5. Change the ROOTDIR setting to match your volume name.
<P>
Now, MPW is customized to produce a shared library. Verify this by
building a sample library.
<P>
To create a sample shared library:
1. In the MPW Worksheet window, type MAKE and press Command+Return.
2. Highlight the output from MAKE and execute it by pressing
Command+Return.
<P>
A file called TestLib.MLB will be created in your FoxLCK:Source
folder.
<P>
To test the sample shared library:
1. Drag TestLib.MLB to your Systems:Extensions folder.
2. Run FoxPro.
3. In the Command Window, type SET LIBRARY TO TestLib.
<P>
Event messages from the library will appear in your main FoxPro
window. To stop the output, use the command SET LIBRARY TO with no
parameter.
<P>
 
2. _Alloca() Caution
<P>
The following caution is part of the description for _Alloca() in
Chapter 10 of the documentation. Though the sample code in
EXAMPLES.DBF has been modified to illustrate this, the caution still
applies to any code you write.
<P>
CAUTION  Some C compilers, such as MPW C, do not support memory
allocation from the stack; calls to _Alloca() will have unpredictable
results. Instead, use local variables, or calls to _AllocHand() and
_FreeHand(), in your code to reserve memory.
<P>
 
3. Including PRO_EXT.H
<P>
Definitions in PRO_EXT.H might conflict with definitions in other
include files you are using. For better results when you compile, put
PRO_EXT.H last in your list of include files..
<P>
 
4. Installing .MLB Files
<P>
Built .MLB files must be placed in the EXTENSIONS folder.
<P>
IMPORTANT  Do not build directly to the EXTENSIONS folder. Send output
to a work directory, then move the file to the EXTENSIONS folder
afterward.
<P>
 
5. Errors While Using _Execute
<P>
If an error occurs in the program passed to _Execute, the error
displays as a normal program error, with Cancel, Suspend, and Ignore
buttons. To prevent this display, make sure the program has its own
error handler.
<P>
 
Part 2: Changes to Documentation Since Printing
 
<P>
Any changes to example code in the documentation should also be
changed in the EXAMPLES.DBF file.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 69</h3>
 
In the example code for _ActivateIdle, change:
<PRE>    void FAR IdleHandler(WHandle wh, EventRec *ev)
</PRE>to:
<PRE>    void FAR IdleHandler()

</PRE>The two parameters are ignored on the Macintosh, and can cause
problems on Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 99</h3>
 
In the example code for _DeActivateIdle, change:
<PRE>    void FAR IdleHandler(WHandle wh, EventRec *ev)
</PRE>to:
<PRE>    void FAR IdleHandler()

</PRE><h3>Page 321</h3>
 
Add a note to the end of the Description column for the rMouseDown
event:
<P>
<PRE>   N/A for Macintosh.
