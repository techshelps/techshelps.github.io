The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, and 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, and 2.6
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Under certain circumstances, you may want to redefine the ENTER key so that
it performs an action, such as executing a procedure. However, if an error
occurs during development before the ENTER key is returned to its original
state, no commands can be entered in the Command window, and the statement
following the ON KEY LABEL ENTER command will attempt to execute instead.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Issuing the command "ON KEY LABEL ENTER &lt;function or command&gt;" prior to the
point at which that action is desired will cause that statement to be
executed when the ENTER key is pressed. To return the ENTER key to its
normal functionality, the command "ON KEY LABEL ENTER" (with nothing
following it) should be the first line of code in the procedure or function
(or the second line if there is a PARAMETER statement).
<P>
However, errors may occur before the line returning the ENTER key to the
default is executed, preventing the ENTER key from terminating commands in
the Command window. The following methods will allow you to restore the
normal functionality of the ENTER key.
<P>
After returning to the Command window from the error condition, do the
following:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In FoxPro for MS-DOS, choose Macros from the System menu. In FoxPro for
   Windows, choose Macros from the Program menu.

<P><LI>Select an unused default macro, such as F3.

<P><LI>Choose the Edit button.

<P><LI>Type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ON KEY LABEL enter{LITERAL+ENTER}
</PRE>
<P><LI>Choose OK twice to close the Edit and Macros windows.

<P><LI>Press the macro key you just assigned.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The above method will not work if the macro key you chose is already
assigned an action by an ON KEY LABEL command. For example, if the command
ON KEY LABEL F3 WAIT WIND TIME() is issued at the beginning of a FoxPro
session and is never released, the macro editor will still show the default
of "LIST{ENTER}" for F3. Even though the macro is redefined, the ON KEY
LABEL trap will have precedence, and the current time will be displayed
instead.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose New. In the New File dialog box, choose
   Program and then choose New.

<P><LI>In the UNTITLED.PRG window, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ON KEY LABEL ENTER
</PRE>
<P><LI>Press CTRL+O to execute the program and choose Yes to save changes.
   Type a name for the program and then choose Save.
<P>
</OL>The ENTER key is now reset.
