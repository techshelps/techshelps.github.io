The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This information is also available in FoxPro's online Help system.
<P>
To go directly to this topic, choose the "Tips and Tricks" Help topic. Then
do one of the following, depending on which online Help file is in use:

<UL><LI>FOXHELP.HLP: Choose the "Performance Tips" jump text.

<LI>FOXHELP.DBF: Scroll to the "Performance Tips" heading.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Out-of-Date Index</h3>
 
<P>
If a table operation is returning the wrong answer, try recreating the
index in case the index is out-of-date. It is best to re-create an index
instead of using the REINDEX command because REINDEX does not fix a damaged
index file.
<P>
<P><h3>Rebuild .CDX Files</h3>
 
<P>
Occasionally rebuild .CDX files. This can reduce the .CDX file size,
thereby improving performance. When recreating .CDX tags, you should first
remove the tags using the DELETE TAG ALL command.
<P>
<P><h3>Pack Tables and Memo Files</h3>
 
<P>
PACK your tables periodically. This will reduce the size of the tables and
improve performance. Use the PACK MEMO command to reduce size of associated
memo files, especially for tables in which you frequently make changes to
memo fields.
<P>
<P><h3>BROWSE and SCAN Performance</h3>
 
<P>
To enhance the performance of BROWSE or SCAN commands, periodically SORT
tables into the most frequently used order (that is, sort into the order of
the most frequently used index).
<P>
<P><h3>Multi-Table Query Performance</h3>
 
<P>
To enhance multi-table queries, SORT the tables by the join condition.
<P>
<P><h3>Optimizing Queries</h3>
 
<P>
Queries are optimized when the table has no order set. Use SET ORDER TO
without a tag name to remove a set order. If you have SET DELETE ON, you
will need a .CDX tag on DELETED() to optimize queries for that table.
<P>
<P><h3>Adding Records to a Table</h3>
 
<P>
Use the INSERT - SQL command to add new records to a table. This command
provides better performance and greater integrity across a network than the
combination of the APPEND BLANK and REPLACE commands.
<P>
<P><h3>Screen Input/Output</h3>
 
<P>
The SHOW GETS command is commonly used to refresh @...GET commands on
screen when a change is made. Using SHOW GETS can dramatically impact the
performance of applications using screens with many objects or on slower
machines. Instead, consider using the SHOW GET command to only refresh the
@...GET being modified instead of the entire screen.
<P>
In addition, FoxPro for Macintosh allows you to create picture buttons and
check boxes by specifying a picture file. These types of controls take
longer to refresh using SHOW GETS than normal text prompts.
<P>
<P><h3>Run Fewer Applications</h3>
 
<P>
Reduce the number of applications running in a Macintosh session. Macintosh
is a cooperative multitasking environment. The more applications you have
running, the more system resources are diverted from FoxPro.
<P>
<P><h3>Memory Variables</h3>
 
<P>
Use the #DEFINE directive in FoxPro for Macintosh to significantly reduce
the number of memory variables used in your applications, saving memory.
<P>
<P><h3>Wallpaper Considerations</h3>
 
<P>
If you have limited memory, do not use wallpaper for the main FoxPro window
because it requires extra memory. In addition, it impacts performance
whenever the screen is refreshed.
<P>
<P><h3>Memory Allocation</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro does not allocate memory for all of its resources when it is
launched. For example, FoxPro windows are allocated from the available
memory pool. Therefore, you should make enough memory available using the
MEMLIMIT setting in your CONFIG.FPM file.
