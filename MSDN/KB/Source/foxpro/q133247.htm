<P>
<P><h3>Answers to Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
 
<P>
Here are some of the questions most frequently asked about Microsoft Visual
FoxPro. Please scan this list before calling Microsoft Technical Support.
If you are viewing this information in a Help file, you can click
the question to see the answer.
<P>
<P><h3>Configuration and Installation Issues</h3>
 
<P>
Q1: Why does my MEMLIMIT setting no longer work?
<P>
A1: Visual FoxPro allocates memory dynamically on all supported platforms.
Therefore, the MEMLIMIT setting is no longer required.
<P>
Q2: How do I set the defaults I want in my Visual FoxPro environment?
<P>
A2: You can include the desired SET commands in your Visual FoxPro
configuration file, CONFIG.FPW. In the CONFIG.FPW file, the syntax for SET
commands is command = value. For example, if you want to set the default
directory in CONFIG.FPW, the command line would be:
<P>
<PRE>   DEFAULT=C:\VFP

</PRE>To change settings that are not available through SET commands, you can
click Options on the Tools menu. The Options dialog box allows you to
change the settings for these features:

<UL><LI>Interface options
<LI>Data entry and programming options
<LI>Text editor options
<LI>Table options
<LI>Remote data access options
<LI>Directory, path, and file location options
<LI>Form Designer options
<LI>Project Manager options
<LI>Visual Class Library and OLE options
<LI>Date, time, and numeric format options
<P>
</UL>Q3: How do I change the title of the main Visual FoxPro window?
<P>
A3: In your configuration file, CONFIG.FPW, add the TITLE command using the
following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   TITLE=MyTitle

</PRE>If you have a startup program, you can include the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   _SCREEN.Caption=MyTitle

</PRE>Q4: Why do I get errors on Disk 2 during installation?
<P>
A4: There are several possible causes of installation errors starting on
Disk 2. First, check to see if the error is caused by a bad disk, a
hardware failure, or a virus. If you have eliminated these as the cause,
the errors may relate to the Distribution Media Format (DMF) of the disks.
With the exception of the Setup disk (Disk 1), Visual FoxPro disks use a
new format called Distribution Media Format (DMF). DMF increases the
capacity of a 3.5-inch floppy disk, reducing the number of disks needed to
install Visual FoxPro. This speeds up the installation process.
<P>
CAUTION: Because DMF is a new format, many existing utilities such as
Norton Disk Doctor, Microsoft ScanDisk, MS-DOS DiskCopy, and Microsoft
Windows Copy Disk do not recognize DMF. You should NOT use disk utilities
to examine a DMF-formatted disk, as these utilities can corrupt the DMF
disk. You cannot copy DMF-formatted disks using MS-DOS DiskCopy or
Microsoft Windows Copy Disk.
<P>
Operating systems other than Windows 3.1 (or later) and Windows NT 3.5 (or
later) may not have the correct files to support DMF. For users with
Windows NT 3.1, if you updated FLOPPY.SYS or have installed Microsoft
Windows NT Service Pack 3, you should be able to install Visual FoxPro. If
you did not install these files or are unsure about what to do, there are
three things you can do to correct this problem:

<UL><LI>Update your operating system.
<LI>Contact Microsoft Technical Support to obtain the correct
   system files.
<LI>Contact Customer Service for a fulfillment disk set.
<P>
</UL><h3>Professional and Standard Editions of Visual FoxPro</h3>
 
<P>
Q5: What are the differences between the Professional and Standard Editions
of Visual FoxPro?
<P>
A5: The Professional Edition of Visual FoxPro allows developers to create,
compile, and distribute royalty-free applications. In addition, the
following features and tools are available only in the Professional
Edition:

<UL><LI>Setup Wizard
<LI>Documenting Wizard
<LI>Upsizing Wizard
<LI>Printed Language Reference and Professional Features Guide
<LI>Two versions of the Windows Help compiler
<LI>OLE controls for communications, messaging, outlining, and picture clips
<LI>API Library Construction
<LI>Class Browser (displays the classes in a class library or a form)
<P>
</UL>Q6: Can I create OLE controls with Visual FoxPro?
<P>
A6: No. You can purchase OLE controls from third-party vendors or you can
create them yourself using the Microsoft OLE Custom Control Developer's Kit
provided with Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 2.0.
<P>
Q7: Does Visual FoxPro support .VBX files?
<P>
A7: No. Visual FoxPro supports OLE controls.
<P>
Q8: If I own the Standard Edition and I don't have a printed Language
Reference, where do I find the description and syntax for a command?
<P>
A8: You can find descriptions of all language elements, such as commands,
functions, properties, events, and methods, in Help menu. On the Help
file's main table of contents, click the Language Reference topic to access
alphabetical lists of language topics, or click the Search button to find
and go to a specific language topic.
<P>
<P><h3>Cross-Platform, Conversion, and Migration Issues</h3>
 
<P>
Q9: I have existing FoxPro projects. How do I update them to run in Visual
FoxPro?
<P>
A9: Visual FoxPro includes a converter that will convert applications
created in previous versions of FoxPro to Visual FoxPro version 3.0. The
converter leaves your original version 2.x application intact. However, if
you plan to develop cross-platform applications, be aware that UNIX,
MS-DOS, and Macintosh each have platform-specific features that may not be
available in Windows and vice versa.
<P>
Q10: Can I convert my dBASE applications to Visual FoxPro?
<P>
A10: Visual FoxPro will convert your dBASE files to formats compatible with
Visual FoxPro. If you have existing dBASE catalogs (.CAT files), you can
convert them to Visual FoxPro projects (.PJX files). When you open a dBASE
catalog, Visual FoxPro does the following:

<UL><LI>Converts tables to Visual FoxPro format.
<LI>Converts screens to forms so that you can modify them with the Form
   Designer.
<LI>Converts reports and labels so that you can modify them with the Report
   Designer.
<LI>Adds dBASE queries (.QBE files) to the Project Manager as programs under
   the Code tab so that you can run them.
<P>
</UL>Q11: Can I use any Visual FoxPro feature in my FoxPro for Macintosh, FoxPro
for MS-DOS, or FoxPro for UNIX applications?
<P>
A11: No, not until a version of Visual FoxPro specific to that platform is
released.
<P>
<P><h3>Interface Features</h3>
 
<P>
Q12: Where are the Database and Run menus?
<P>
A12: Visual FoxPro now uses the concept of the database as a container of
tables rather than referring to the individual tables as databases. The
Visual FoxPro database (.DBC file) makes the options on the Database menu
obsolete. The Run menu was also removed because the options on this menu
have been eliminated or relocated to other menus.
<P>
Q13: Where do I find a list of the system toolbars available in Visual
FoxPro?
<P>
A13: You can see a list of the available system toolbars by clicking
Toolbars on the View menu. You can customize a toolbar by selecting it from
the list in the Toolbars dialog box and clicking the Customize button.
<P>
Q14: I collapsed the Project Manager window so that it is now part of the
toolbar. How do I restore it to its expanded form?
<P>
A14: With the mouse, click in the rectangular area immediately above any of
the tabs. Drag the Project Manager to the main Visual FoxPro window and
drop it there.
<P>
Q15: When I click the right mouse button why does a menu appear?
<P>
A15: The right mouse button now activates shortcut menus that are context-
sensitive. In other words, if the mouse pointer is positioned over an
object and you click the right mouse button, a menu appears with choices
appropriate for working with that object.
<P>
Q16: When I look at the tables in the Database Designer, what are the lines
that connect some of the tables?
<P>
A16: The lines connecting tables in the Database Designer are a visual
representation of the persistent relationships between the tables.
<P>
Q17: When I'm working with several windows and toolbars open, how can I
reduce the clutter on my screen?
<P>
A17: You have several options:

<UL><LI>You can dock toolbars at the top or sides of your screen.
<LI>You can press CTRL+F1 to activate each window until the one you want is
   on top.
<LI>You can use the Window list on the Window menu to select the window you
   want to activate.
<LI>You can position and resize your windows.
<P>
</UL><h3>Designers</h3>
 
<P>
Q18: Does the Screen Builder exist in Visual FoxPro?
<P>
A18: The Screen Builder is replaced by the Form Designer. For information
on using the Form Designer, see the Form Designer topic in online Help.
<P>
Q19: Does Visual FoxPro generate .SPR files?
<P>
A19: Visual FoxPro does not generate code. It now runs the forms directly
from the .SCX file in a manner similar to the way in which FoxPro ran
reports directly from the .FRX.
<P>
Q20: What is the difference between the Database Designer and the Data
Environment Designer?
<P>
A20: The Database Designer displays all the tables, views, and
relationships contained in a database. The Data Environment Designer
contains all the tables, views, and relationships that are to be opened
when you run or modify a form or report.
<P>
Q21: How do I create an array property on a form?
<P>
A21: On the Form menu, click New Property, and enter the array name and its
dimensions.
<P>
Q22: When subclassing a control, I want to add new code to the click event
of the button, but I also want the code in the parent class to be executed.
How can I do this?
<P>
A22: In the Click event, add objectname::click in the Name text box before
you add any of your new code. This forces Visual FoxPro to execute the
parent click event. The code you added is executed next.
<P>
Q23: When creating a class based on a button, how do I reference properties
of the form on which the button is placed?
<P>
A23: You can use the ThisForm, This.Parent, or Thisformset object
references. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   ThisForm.Caption="MYCAPTION"

</PRE>Q24: After I've defined a class, how do I activate or access the object?
<P>
A24: A class is a specification from which an object is created. A class is
similar to the blueprint of a house or a schematic for a telephone. The
blueprint or schematic simply lays out the characteristics and features of
the house or telephone. You cannot activate a class. You must create an
object from the class using the CREATEOBJECT() function. You can then show
the object. For more information, please see the CREATEOBJECT() topic in
Help menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Wizards and Builders</h3>
 
<P>
Q25: What is the difference between a wizard and a builder?
<P>
A25: A wizard takes you step-by-step through a process to accomplish a
common and predefined task such as creating a query. A builder lets you
create a customized set of properties for an existing object such as a
control.
<P>
Q26: What wizards and builders are available in Visual FoxPro?
<P>
A26: The wizards available in Visual FoxPro are:

<UL><LI>Cross-Tab Query Wizard
<LI>Form Wizard
<LI>Graph Wizard
<LI>Group/Total Report Wizard
<LI>Import Wizard
<LI>Label Wizard
