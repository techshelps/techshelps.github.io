<P><h2>Part 1: FoxPro Runtime 2.6 for UNIX Notes</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>New Key Sequence</h3>
 
FoxPro includes a refresh key sequence to clear terminals when the
screen becomes garbled (system wide messages, noise on the serial line).
This key sequence is Ctrl+].
<P>
<P><h3>terminfo Entries</h3>
 
See the file terminfo.src in your FoxPro Runtime installation directory
(usually /usr/lib/foxpro) for information about what terminals are
supported and how to write a new entry if you are having problems with
your terminal.
 
<P>
 
Part 2: Installation Notes
 
<P>
FoxPro Runtime is normally installed in the directory /usr/lib/foxpro by
the installation utility custom. Instructions on how to install using
custom can be found in the Installation and Configuration manual. If you do
not want to install FoxPro Runtime in the default directory or if you do
not have the custom utility, you can install FoxPro Runtime using the shell
script "extract" located on the first installation disk.
<P>
To use the script "extract", follow these steps:
<P>
1  Change your current directory to the directory you wish to install
<PRE>   in (the default is /usr/lib/foxpro).  For example, type the
   following at the system prompt and press Enter:

       cd /other/FoxPro

</PRE>2  If your 3.5-inch drive is your A: drive, to copy the extract script
<PRE>   off the installation disk type the following at the system prompt and
   press Enter:

       tar xvf /dev/install ./tmp/extract

   If your 3.5-inch drive is your B: drive, use /dev/install1:

       tar xvf /dev/install1 ./tmp/extract

</PRE>3  Type one of the following to run the extract script:
<P>
<PRE>   For drive A:  ./tmp/extract /dev/install

   -or-

   For drive B:  ./tmp/extract /dev/install1

</PRE>4  Follow the system prompts.
<P>
Note that some systems may use device names other than /dev/install and
/dev/install1.  If you get an extraction error, consult your system
documentation for the name of your floppy device.
<P>
If you have the directory /etc/perms, a permissions file is added to it.
This file contains the new location of the FoxPro Runtime files so that the
custom utility will work as expected when removing FoxPro Runtime.
 
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 3: Running on Non-SCO Systems</h2>
 
<P>
Some FoxPro Runtime for UNIX features are not completely supported on
platforms other than SCO UNIX. These features include direct video memory
writes, the SCO event queue management system, scancode support on
terminals, and compression technology. Below is a description of how to
work around these features.
<P>
<P><h3>Direct Video Memory Writes</h3>
 
On some non-SCO systems, accessing the console video memory directly
results in the loss of multi-screen functionality. To disable direct video
memory writes, include the -o switch on the command line when starting
FoxPro Runtime.
<P>
<P><h3>SCO Event Queue Management</h3>
 
Some systems either do not support the SCO event queue system, or do so
incorrectly. If you are having trouble accessing the keyboard, include the
-e switch on the command line when starting FoxPro Runtime to disable the
event queue.
<P>
<P><h3>Scan Code Support</h3>
 
Most non-SCO systems do not support scan codes over a serial line and some
have trouble even on the console. To disable scan code support add the -i
switch on the command line when starting FoxPro Runtime.
<P>
<P><h3>Compression Utility</h3>
 
Most of the FoxPro Runtime installation files are compressed. SCO supports
a version of tar that automatically uncompresses the compressed files. If
you aren't running SCO UNIX 3.2.2, XENIX 2.3.4, or a later version of these
products, you won't have the correct version of tar. When this happens, the
installation scripts attempt to decompress with the uncompress utility. If
both tar and the uncompress utility are not present, you will not be able
to install FoxPro Runtime. For more information about uncompress utilities
supported by your system, see your system documentation.
 
<P>
<P>
 
Part 4: scoterm Resources
 
<P>
The resource file that SCO ships for scoterm (/usr/lib/X11/app-
defaults/ScoTerm) may not provide all of the resources necessary to run
FoxPro Runtime effectively in a scoterm window. scoterm will not run in
scancode mode unless the *keyboard resource is set to a value (for example,
us). Also, the default colors need to be set up to match the console's
colors.
<P>
See the file goodies/scoterm.res for the correct resources.
