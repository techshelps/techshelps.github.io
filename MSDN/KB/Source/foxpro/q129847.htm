   version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Upsizing Wizard creates a SQL Server database that duplicates, as much
as possible, the functionality of a Visual FoxPro database. The Upsizing
Wizard is included only with the Professional Edition of Visual FoxPro.
This article outlines basic steps and recommendations for running the
Upsizing Wizard in Visual FoxPro.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Running the Upsizing Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
You can use the Upsizing Wizard to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Move local data to a remote server.

  - Transform local base tables and local views into remote base tables and
    remote views.

  - Migrate a local application to a client/server application.

</PRE>Upsizing can take a long time, depending on the size of your data, the
amount of network traffic, and the number of concurrent demands being
handled by your server. Large tables may require several hours to upsize.
<P>
The Upsizing Wizard takes you through the following steps.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1 - Local Database Selection</h3>
 
<P>
Choose Wizards from the Tools menu, and then select Upsizing. This launches
the Upsizing Wizard and presents you with the Step 1 dialog box that
prompts you to select the database file you want to upsize. If you don't
have a database open, choose the Open button to select and open a database.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2 - Data Source Selection</h3>
 
<P>
If you use a named connection to access your data source, the Upsizing
Wizard associates the named connection with any remote views it creates
during upsizing.
<P>
If you use a data source name rather than a connection name to log on to
the data source and you choose to have the wizard create remote views, the
Upsizing Wizard creates a named connection called "Upsize" (or "Upsize2,"
"Upsize3," and so on - if a connection definition already exists with the
suggested name).
<P>
When you choose the Next button, the wizard displays the ODBC Login dialog.
If you used a named connection with a saved password, the wizard logs you
on to the SQL Server you've selected without prompting you for ODBC login
information.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 3 - Target Database</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to add Visual FoxPro tables to an existing SQL Server database,
you can upsize to an existing database. If you upsize to an existing
database, the wizard jumps to Step 6.
<P>
If you choose to create a new remote database, the name can be up to 30
characters and include letters, digits, and the symbols #, $, and _. Spaces
are not allowed.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 4 - Database Device (SQL Server)</h3>
 
<P>
Select the size and device for your database. Choose from existing devices
or create a new one. The size of a new database must be at least 2 MB,
which is the minimum allowed by SQL Server.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 5 - Log Device (SQL Server)</h3>
 
<P>
SQL Server creates a transaction log for your database that can be used to
reconstruct the database in the event of a serious system problem.
<P>
Ideally, a database and its corresponding log should be placed on devices
that are on separate physical disks. These devices must be created before
you start the Upsizing Wizard, as the wizard creates all new devices on the
same physical disk where the master database device resides.
<P>
If you have only one physical disk, you should place the database and its
log on separate devices, so that you can use the SQL server DUMP
TRANSACTION command.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 6 - Tables to Upsize</h3>
 
<P>
To ensure the accuracy of exported data, the wizard tries to open all the
tables for exclusive use in the database you chose to upsize. If any tables
are open and shared, the wizard closes them and reopens them exclusively,
which might cause you to lose any temporary relations established with the
SET RELATION or SET SKIP commands. Any tables that can't be opened
exclusively won't be available to upsize.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 7 - Field Data Types</h3>
 
<P>
You can't change the default mapping for a key field to a data type that
prevents the field from being indexed. You can change the default mapping
of a field that is part of an index key if you choose a data type that can
be indexed; however, you might want to change the data types for the other
fields in the key to match. Visual FoxPro warns you if you change the
default data type mapping for a field that is not a key field but is used
in a Visual FoxPro index.
<P>
If you make a mistake, click Reset To Defaults to reset the data types. For
more information on the default data types used, search for the "Data Type
Mapping in the Upsizing Wizard" topic in the Visual FoxPro Help file.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 8 - Upsizing Options</h3>
 
<P>
By default, the Upsizing Wizard exports a table's structure and its data.
Along with field names and data types, you can also export indexes,
defaults, relationships (referential integrity constraints), and validation
rules. Visual FoxPro indexes and defaults become SQL Server indexes and
defaults.
<P>
If you choose to export validation rules, the Upsizing Wizard attempts to
export field- and row-level validation rules to SQL Server, where they
become stored procedures called from SQL Server triggers. Exported table
relationships also become part of these triggers.
<P>
If you upsize table relationships, be sure to upsize indexes as well or you
might experience mediocre performance.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 9 - Finish</h3>
 
<P>
You can choose to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Upsize without generating SQL code.

    -or-

  - Generate the SQL code for upsizing.

    -or-

  - Upsize and generate SQL code.

</PRE>The first and third options are available only if you have CREATE TABLE
permission on the SQL server. If you choose either of the options that save
generated SQL code, all the SQL code generated by the Upsizing Wizard is
stored on your hard disk.
