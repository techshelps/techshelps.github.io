</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
Why does the FoxPro installation sometimes stop before
allowing the installation of optional components?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
Sometimes in low memory conditions the installation program
is unable to determine whether to run the Standard
(FOXPRO.EXE) or the 32-bit Extended (FOXPROX.EXE) version
to complete the installation. If you're installing from
within Windows, you can exit Windows to make more memory
available. If you have any TSR programs residing in memory,
removing them from memory may free additional memory. For
information on installing optional components after you have
installed FoxPro, see Question 2 in this section.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
How do I install additional files that I didn't specify
during installation?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
Restart FoxPro by typing FOX at the MS-DOS prompt and
pressing Enter. Insert any one of the product disks into
drive A and enter the following command in the FoxPro
Command window:
<P>
<PRE>   DO INSTALL

</PRE>You are prompted to insert the disk or disks that
contain the additional files you want to install. If you
are attempting to install from a drive other than drive A,
you are instructed to select another source drive
after the "Abort, Retry, Fail?" message.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
Why does FoxPro reboot during the installation process?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
You could have an anti-virus program running, a memory
conflict, or an old video driver. Disable any anti-virus
program or old video driver and retry the installation
of optional components as described in Question 2, above.
Make sure you are excluding areas of memory required to
load video drivers or network cards. For example, if you
are loading EMM386 in your CONFIG.SYS file, the
"X=D800-DFFF" parameter in the following device driver
load command in MS-DOS will reserve those memory segments:
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE RAM 2048 X=D800-DFFF

</PRE>If you are using an older version of your video card
driver, contact the manufacturer or use the Microsoft
Download Service (MSDL) to get new drivers. MSDL is
described in the Product Support section, below.
<P>
If you are installing from within Windows, try using a
different video driver (for example, the generic VGA
driver, VGA.DRV) and run with no old video drivers
loaded in the AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS files.
 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
What MS-DOS BUFFERS and FILES statements are appropriate for
FoxPro for MS-DOS?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
For best performance with FoxPro when the SMARTDRV device
driver is loaded, set BUFFERS to 10 in the CONFIG.SYS file.
Anything more is redundant, taking up valuable memory that
FoxPro could use for processing.
<P>
If you don't use a disk cache program such as SMARTDRV,
you should allocate enough MS-DOS buffers to hold all of
the directory entries in the subdirectory where you will
be working. Setting BUFFERS to 40 is usually sufficient
as long as the number of files in a subdirectory remains
below 250.
<P>
The FILES statement should always be at least 10 more than
the greatest number of files that you will have open at
one time. We recommend that you set FILES to 40 or greater.
 
<P>
Question 5
<P>
Can I run the FoxPro 2.5 32-bit Extended version in Enhanced
Mode Windows or with EMM386 with the NOEMS option?
<P>
Answer 5
<P>
Yes. FoxPro 2.5 works with DPMI-compliant memory managers,
such as Microsoft Windows and EMM386. If you use a DPMI
memory manager, you can control the physical memory that
FoxPro uses by specifying the MEMLIMIT option in your
CONFIG.FP file. For more information on the MEMLIMIT option,
refer to the Update manual and to "Changes to Documentation
Since Printing" in Help.
 
<P>
Question 6
<P>
What factors influence FoxPro startup speed?
<P>
Answer 6
<P>
The time required to load and start FoxPro relates to the
physical size of FoxPro, the length of the path in effect,
the number of items FoxPro has to locate at startup, and
other factors. You can control many of these items.
For a complete discussion of this issue, refer to
"Optimizing Your System" in the Installation and
Configuration manual.
 
<P>
Question 7
<P>
I'm receiving the error message "Too many files open."
How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 7
<P>
If you receive this error message, use one or more of the
following strategies:
<P>
* Increase the FILES setting in the CONFIG.SYS file.
* If you are using a Novell network, increase the FILE
<PRE>  HANDLES setting in the SHELL.CFG file.
</PRE>* If you are using the MS-DOS SHARE program, increase the
<PRE>  number of files and locks. For example, you could use
  SHARE /F: 4096 /L:500 in the CONFIG.SYS file.
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 8
<P>
The Standard version of FoxPro 2.5 for MS-DOS runs
correctly on my computer, but when I load the 32-bit
Extended version I receive the error message "Incompatible
memory manager."  What's causing this problem?
<P>
Answer 8
<P>
When you configure your memory manager, verify that it
can use extended memory, and that the proper switches
are set. For further information on the 32-bit Extended
version of FoxPro, refer to "Optimizing Your System" in
the Installation and Configuration Guide.
 
<P>
Question 9
<P>
I'm receiving the error message "RUN/! command failed." How
can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 9
<P>
Make sure your CONFIG.SYS file contains this line:
<P>
<PRE>  SHELL = C:\&lt;path&gt;\COMMAND.COM C:\&lt;path&gt;\ /P /E:1024

</PRE>Also, make sure that the correct version of COMMAND.COM
resides in the specified directory.
<P>
If the SHELL line shown here is already in your CONFIG.SYS
file, then you've received this error because FoxPro doesn't
have enough conventional memory to execute the RUN command.
If this is the case, use RUN /0 DIR instead of RUN DIR.
RUN /0 automatically loads FoxSwap, which makes all
available conventional memory accessible to FoxPro.
For more information on the RUN command and FoxSwap, refer
to "RUN|! Commands" in Help.
 
<P>
Question 10
<P>
Why do I have several files with the extension .TMP on my
disk?
<P>
Answer 10
<P>
Every time you load FoxPro, it creates temporary (.TMP)
files. These files are automatically deleted when you exit
FoxPro with a normal shutdown. However, .TMP files still
exist if you reboot the machine from within FoxPro, or if
you don't have delete rights in the directory where the
files reside. Exit FoxPro and acquire the rights to delete
all these files. One caution: Other programs, such as
Windows, also create .TMP files. To be safe, make sure no
other applications are active when you delete .TMP files.
 
<P>
Question 11
<P>
When I try to start up a second instance of FoxPro 2.5 for
MS-DOS within Windows, I get the error "Cannot access file
at this time." This only happens when the version of
FoxPro resides on my local drive.
<P>
Answer 11
<P>
The MS-DOS SHARE program is the most common cause of this
problem. Current workarounds include marking the FoxPro
FOXPRO.EXE and FOXPROX.EXE files read only, running under
Windows for Workgroups, or running a copy of FoxPro from
a network location.
 
 
<P><h2>Part 2: Network Issues</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 
<P>
1   When a second user loads Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS
<PRE>    on my network, the user receives the error message
    "File in use by another." How can I correct this
    problem?
</PRE>2   In a network environment, where does FoxPro create
<PRE>    temporary files?
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
When a second user loads Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS on
my network, the user receives the error message "File in
use by another." How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
If you are on a peer-to-peer network other than Windows
for Workgroups, you must first load MS-DOS SHARE and then
verify that the FoxPro files are marked as read only.
<P>
FoxPro uses a resource file called FOXUSER to store
information about windows, color sets, and other FoxPro
objects. The FOXUSER database can be shared only if the
file is marked read only. If you receive this error message
when you try to open a database file, make sure that all
users have the SET EXCLUSIVE setting OFF.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
In a network environment, where does FoxPro create
temporary files?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
FoxPro creates temporary files in the current working
directory unless you specifically designate an alternate
location by including one or more of the EDITWORK, SORTWORK,
PROGWORK and/or TMPFILES statements in the CONFIG.FP file.
<P>
If local workstations have sizable hard drives with plenty
of free space or have large amounts of RAM, you can improve
performance in the multiuser environment by placing FoxPro
temporary work files on the local drive or on a RAM drive.
Redirecting these files to a local drive or a RAM drive
provides additional speed by reducing the need to access
the network drive.
<P>
On small networks that have older workstations with slow
hard drives, you might experience better performance by
leaving FoxPro temporary files on the file server. When
in doubt, direct temporary files to the local hard drive.
 
 
<P><h2>Part 3: Converting from FoxPro 2.0 to FoxPro 2.5 for MS-DOS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 
<P>
1   Are my existing FoxPro 2.0 screens and reports
<PRE>    compatible with FoxPro 2.5?
</PRE>2   Can I use my existing library files created with the
<PRE>    FoxPro 2.0 Library Construction Kit in FoxPro 2.5?
</PRE>3   Are my existing programs compiled under FoxPro 2.0
<PRE>    compatible with FoxPro 2.5?
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
Are my existing FoxPro 2.0 screens and reports compatible
with FoxPro 2.5?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
The structures of the databases created by the power tools
have changed in FoxPro 2.5. When you first open screen and
report files created in FoxPro 2.0, FoxPro 2.5 ask if you
want to convert them to FoxPro 2.5 format. This conversion
is a one-way process -- files that have been converted to
2.5 formats may no longer be opened in 2.0. You may want
to make backups before converting. For more information
about specific FoxPro 2.5 file formats, see "Tables" in
the Update manual.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
Can I use my existing library files created with the
FoxPro 2.0 Library Construction Kit in FoxPro 2.5?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
Library files created with the FoxPro 2.0 Library
Construction Kit must be relinked before they can be used
in FoxPro 2.5.
<P>
The directory FOXPRO25\GOODIES\LCKUPDAT contains files
that allow you to update PLBs built using the FoxPro 2.0
Library Construction Kit for use with FoxPro 2.5 for
MS-DOS. If you obtained your PLBs from another source,
such as a software supplier or online service, contact
that source for updated libraries that work with
FoxPro 2.5. To use these files, follow the directions in
the LCKUPDAT.TXT file located in the
FOXPRO25\GOODIES\LCKUPDAT directory.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
Are my existing programs compiled under FoxPro 2.0 compatible
with FoxPro 2.5?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
Programs compiled under FoxPro 2.0, such as .APP and .FXP
files, are not compatible with FoxPro 2.5. To run such
applications or programs in FoxPro 2.5, you must rebuild
or recompile them. For more information about rebuilding
FoxPro 2.0 applications, see "Using Files From Other
Platforms" in the Update manual.
 
 
<P><h2>Part 4: New Features</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 
<P>
1   FoxPro 2.0 supported 25 work areas. Has this limit been
<PRE>    raised in FoxPro 2.5?
</PRE>2   Are additional file types supported for direct import
<PRE>    into FoxPro?
</PRE>3   What language enhancements have been made to FoxPro
<PRE>    2.5?
</PRE>4   I have heard a great deal of discussion about cross-
<PRE>    platform application development. Is this capability
    a reality with FoxPro 2.5?
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
FoxPro 2.0 supported 25 work areas. Has this limit been
raised in 2.5?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
Yes. Both FoxPro 2.5 for Windows and the 32-bit Extended
version of FoxPro 2.5 for MS-DOS support 225 work areas.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
Are additional file types supported for direct import into
FoxPro?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
Yes. We have added support for importing files from
Microsoft Excel 3.0, Microsoft Excel 4.0, Paradox 3.5,
and Paradox 4.0.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
What language enhancements have been made to FoxPro 2.5?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
FoxPro 2.5 contains additional generator directives, new
system memory variables, and new and enhanced commands and
functions. For a complete listing of new features in
FoxPro 2.5, refer to the Update manual.
 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
I've heard a great deal of discussion about cross-
platform application development. Is this capability a
reality with FoxPro 2.5?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
Yes. FoxPro 2.5 allows you to create and maintain
applications that run on multiple platforms, such as Windows
and MS-DOS, and share data with full record locking and
other multiuser capabilities. An application that can run
on multiple platforms is a cross-platform application.
<P>
There are several different approaches to writing cross-
platform applications in FoxPro. You can run your MS-DOS
applications directly in Windows without changing the
applications. Another option automatically takes your
application from one platform and transports it to another
without any additional coding. Transporting is designed for
applications developed with the FoxPro power tools: Screen
Builder,  Menu Builder, Report Writer, and Label Designer.
The third approach allows you to transport your application
from one environment to another while maintaining separate
interfaces for your application on each platform.
<P>
For a detailed discussion and examples of these three
options refer to "Using Files From Other Platforms" in the
Update manual.
 
 
<P><h2>Part 5: Printing Issues</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 
<P>
1   When I try to print boxes, ASCII characters are printed
<PRE>    instead of boxes. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE>2   I'm using the Relational Query By Example (RQBE)
<PRE>    system to send data to a report. The data in the report
    is incorrect; the report prints the same record over
    and over. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE>3   Why can't I select the printer driver check box in the
<PRE>    Printer Setup Dialog box?
</PRE>4   I'm using a Novell network. I can print by using the
<PRE>    Novell CAPTURE command, but the SET PRINTER TO \\SPOOLER
    command doesn't work. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE>5   I can't make the printer drivers work in an executable
<PRE>    file. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
When I try to print boxes, ASCII characters are printed
instead of boxes. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
If you are using an HP laserjet printer, the default
character set does not include line drawing characters.
You can change the default character set by using the
controls on the front panel of the printer. You will
want to set your default to the PC-8 character set.
<P>
If you are not using an HP laserjet printer and are
using printer drivers, in the Printer Setup dialog,
specify a printer setup appropriate for your printer.
If you are already using a printer driver, modify the
P_CODES database in order to send the proper code for
your printer, and rebuild the GENPD.APP file. If you
aren't using a printer driver, send the proper escape
codes to the printer before you print using the
??? command.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
I'm using the Relational Query By Example (RQBE) system
to send data to a report. The data in the report is
incorrect; the report prints the same record over and over.
How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
When you created the report, you used alias names in your
field definitions. To correct the report, simply remove the
alias names. For example, a field containing CUSTOMER.NAME
should be modified to contain only NAME.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
Why can't I select the printer driver check box in the
Printer Setup dialog box?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
This problem occurs if you are missing the GENPD.APP file,
if the _GENPD memory variable is set incorrectly, if the
resource file is turned off, or if the FOXUSER file is
missing, damaged, or marked as read only.
 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
I'm using a Novell network. I can print by using the
Novell CAPTURE command, but the SET PRINTER TO \\SPOOLER
command doesn't work. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
If you are receiving the error message "Printer not ready,"
make sure that there are no spaces before or after the \\SPOOLER
clauses of SET PRINTER. If the printer information
doesn't print until you exit FoxPro, you must issue the
SET PRINT TO command in order to release the print spooler.
 
<P>
Question 5
<P>
I can't make the printer drivers work in an executable
file. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 5
<P>
Open the project to make sure that the GENPD.APP file is
included in the project as an application. If it isn't
included, add GENPD.APP to the project as an application.
<P>
To add GENPD.APP as an application, choose the Add push
button. In the dialog that appears, choose
Application from the Type popup, select GENPD.APP and then
choose the Add push button.
<P>
Note: GENPD.APP is automatically marked as an excluded
project element.
<P>
Rebuild the project and your executable file. Make sure
that you distribute the GENPD.APP, FOXUSER.DBF,
FOXUSER.FPT, and FOXSWAP.COM files with your executable
file.
 
 
<P><h2>Part 6: Screens</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 
<P>
1   Every time I try to generate a specific screen, I have
<PRE>    to add my supporting screens to the screen set. How
    can I avoid this problem?
</PRE>2   When I create a screen set with more than one window,
<PRE>    how do I move the cursor from one window to the next?
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
Every time I try to generate a specific screen, I have to
add my supporting screens to the screen set. How can I
avoid this problem?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
To save these options, you must create a project and
include the screens as a screen set.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
When I create a screen set with more than one window, how
do I move the cursor from one window to the next?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
If all the windows in your screen set are controlled
with one READ command, use the Page Up key, the Page Down
key, or modify the value of the _CUROBJ system memory
variable to cycle through the windows of your screen set.
If any one of the windows in your screen set is not
controlled by the READ command, such as a Browse window,
then you must press CTRL+F1 to cycle through the screen set.
 
 
<P><h2>Part 7: Importing Data</h2>
 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
How do I import a data file into Microsoft FoxPro for
MS-DOS?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
To import a data file, use either the IMPORT command or
the APPEND FROM command. If you're receiving the error
message "String too long to fit," make sure that no
"field" in the source data file exceeds the field
capacity for a FoxPro table. See the System Capacities
topic in Help for additional information. A wide range of
file formats is supported. See the Language Reference
manual for a complete list of the supported file formats.
 
 
<P><h2>Part 8: BROWSE Command</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 
<P>
1   I modified the structure of my database, but when I
<PRE>    use the BROWSE command to view the file, I don't see
    the changes. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE>2   When I press the CTRL+N key combination in my program
<PRE>    to append a new record in the Browse window, I get the
    musical note instead. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
I modified the structure of my database, but when I use
the BROWSE command to view the file, I don't see the changes.
How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
You are most likely using the BROWSE command from the
System menu or the View panel, or you are issuing a BROWSE
LAST or BROWSE PREFERENCE command from the Command window.
To see these structural changes, you must first issue a
plain BROWSE command from the Command window to display
the new default representation of the database.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
When I press the CTRL+N key combination in my program to
append a new record in the Browse window, I get the musical
note instead. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
CTRL+N is a shortcut key combination associated with the
System menu. In your program, you must issue the SET

<P>
Question 1
<P>
I've created an application that does not allow me to
edit my database files. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
Mark your database as excluded in the project, then
rebuild your application. You must distribute these files
to your end users. Including the database in the project
automatically makes these files read only.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
Why can't I build an executable file from within my project?
The options to do so are dimmed and unavailable.
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
To build an executable file, you must purchase the
Microsoft FoxPro Distribution Kit and install it in your
FoxPro directory. Prior to installing the FoxPro
Distribution Kit, make sure that the FoxPro files are not
marked as read only.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
When I attempt to build an executable file, I receive the
error message "Link command failed." How can I correct
this problem?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
If you receive this error message, check the following
items:
<P>
* Make sure that you have enough conventional memory.
* Make sure that you have enough disk space.
* Increase the number of file handles available to FoxPro.
<PRE>  To do this, you can increase the FILES setting in the
  CONFIG.SYS file or increase the FILE HANDLES setting in
  the SHELL.CFG file. This is specific to Novell networks.
</PRE>* Make sure that FoxPro can find your COMMAND.COM file.
* Make sure that the following files are on your path:
<PRE>  WLINK8.EXE, and FOXSWAP.COM.
</PRE>* If you are running the 32-bit Extended Version of FoxPro,
<PRE>  make sure that DOSMEM isn't set to ON in your CONFIG.FP
  file. For more information on DOSMEM, refer to "Customizing
  FoxPro" in the Installation and Configuration guide.
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
My executable file runs correctly under the development
version, but I receive the error message "Feature not
available" under the stand-alone version. How can I
correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
First, check the "Features Not Available" list in the
FoxPro Distribution Kit documentation. Certain features
used for development aren't available in the applications
and executables you create. If you still encounter
problems, it's possible that you're using macro
substitution in your program. The recommended workaround
is to set up a statement which causes the compiler to see
the possible options for the macro-substituted commands
so that they will be compiled into the .EXE file.
For example:
<P>
<PRE> IF .F.
   MODIFY REPORT dummy
   MODIFY LABEL dummy
 ENDIF

</PRE>This code allows the compiler to see the MODIFY REPORT and
MODIFY LABEL commands, but because it is never executed,
the report and label names can be meaningless (dummy).
