<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article demonstrates how to determine the order in which events and
methods are processed for any form.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Understanding the order in which events and methods are processed can help
you place event and method code properly.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Demonstration</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a free table that has a single 20-character field. From the
   Command window, type: CREATE TABLE myorder (event  c  (20)), or follow
   these steps:
<P>
   a. On the File menu, click New. In the New dialog box, click Table, and
<P><PRE>      then click the New File button.
</PRE><P>
   b. Name the table Myorder.
<P>
   c. Create the single field. Name it Even, and give it a Character data
<P><PRE>      type with a length of 20 characters.
</PRE><P>
   d. Click OK to save it. Don't enter any records.

<P><LI>Create or open a form for which you want to determine the firing order
   for the methods and events.

<P><LI>Place the following code in all the event procedures and methods of the
   form and the objects it contains:
<P>
<PRE>      ccur_alias=ALIAS()      &amp;&amp; Capture the form's table name, if any
      SELECT myorder          &amp;&amp; The table recording the order
      APPEND BLANK
      =MESSAGEBOX(PROGRAM())      &amp;&amp; Optional for visual effect
      REPLACE event WITH PROGRAM()
      SELECT (ccur_alias)         &amp;&amp; Returns to the form's table name

   To speed up this process, type the code once, copy it, and then paste it
   into each event procedure.

   When determining which events to include, consider including the Destroy
   event for each object, so you can see the order in which objects are
   destroyed. Basically, Visual FoxPro uses the LIFO method (last in, first
   out) for destroying objects.

</PRE><P><LI>Open the table (Myorder), and run the form. After exiting the form,
   browse the Myorder table.
<P>
</OL>The Myorder table will contain a record for each event or method as it was
processed; this is the flow chart for the form.
<P>
There are a number of events that occur in any form, in the same order each
time. The principal variation will be in the objects and the types of
objects. For example, a single command button will differ from a command
group where each button within the command group has its own individual
Init and Destroy events, among others.
<P>
The order in which objects are loaded depends on the order in which they
were created in the Form Designer. This also dictates the order in which
they will be destroyed; they are destroyed in the reverse order of their
creation.
