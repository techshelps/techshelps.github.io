The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
The Standard version of Microsoft FoxPro version 2.0 can be run as an
MS-DOS-based application under version 3.0 of Microsoft Windows. How
successfully FoxPro runs varies from machine to machine and depends on
a number of factors. For best results, run Windows in standard or 386
enhanced mode. The machine should have at least 2 MB of LIM 4.0
extended memory available. However, additional memory will help to
improve performance. Make sure that space for the swap file is
available on the hard disk, and use a defragmentation utility to
reduce the amount of disk activity required to load files.
<P>
When Windows is running in 386 enhanced mode, using a permanent swap
file instead of a temporary swap file greatly improves performance,
especially when little memory is available. However, a permanent swap
file consumes hard disk space.
<P>
For more information on swap files and how they are created, refer to
Chapter 13, "Optimizing Windows," in the Windows 3.0 "User's Guide."
<P>
NOTE: If you use a Logitech or DEXXA mouse, specify the "Microsoft and
PS/2" option during Windows setup.
<P>
To access FoxPro easily through the Windows Program Manager, do the
following to create a group window and icon for FoxPro:

<OL><P><LI>In the Windows Program Manager, choose New from the File menu.

<P><LI>Choose Program Group and choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose Program Item and choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Description box, type a title for the icon.

<P><LI>Select the Browse button, then navigate to and select the FoxPro

<P>
   -or-
<P>
   In the Command Line box, type the fully qualified path to the
   FoxPro program.

<P><LI>To install a custom icon, select Change Icon. Icon Pak I includes a
   custom FoxPro icon.
<P>
   NOTE: If the "Cannot find any icons in this file" message appears
   when you are selecting a custom icon, replace the name of the
   application in the Change Icon dialog box with PROGMAN. Then select
   View Next until an appropriate icon is displayed.

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>When you double-click the FoxPro icon, Windows runs FoxPro in an MS-DOS
window.
