<P><h3>General Screen Builder Features</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. I created a screen that uses many different types of
<P><PRE>       controls. When I generate the screen and execute it, I find
       that the TAB key cycles through text fields only. I would like
       to be able to cycle through all the controls using the TAB key,
       including buttons, popups, list boxes, and check boxes. How can
       I do this?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The behavior of the TAB key during a READ command is determined
       by the KEYCOMP setting. In FoxPro for Macintosh, the default
       setting of KEYCOMP is MAC. When KEYCOMP is set to MAC, the TAB
       key cycles through text fields only, which is standard behavior
       for Macintosh dialog boxes.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       You can change this behavior from the Command window or from
       within a program by issuing the SET KEYCOMP TO WINDOWS or SET
       KEYCOMP TO DOS command. Either of these KEYCOMP settings allows
       the user to cycle through all objects, not just text fields,
       using the TAB key. For details about the keystroke differences,
       refer to the FoxPro online help system.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I know how to click and drag objects within the Screen
<P><PRE>       Design window using the Selection Pointer tool. Is there an
       easy way to move objects a small distance?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. Select the object using the Selection Pointer tool and
       then use the arrow keys to move the object one pixel at a time.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I created a screen for my application that displays a
<P><PRE>       number of fields. When I run the application, the order in
       which the cursor moves through the fields isn't what I expect.
       How can I change the keyboard access order without changing the
       physical position of the fields?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Open your original screen in the Screen Builder. From the
       Screen menu, choose Object Order. This opens the Object Order
       dialog box, which lists screen objects according to their
       keyboard access order. To change the access order, click the
       button to the left of an object and drag the object to its new
       keyboard access position. When you're done, rebuild your
       application.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. When I choose the Window Style button in the Screen Layout
<P><PRE>       dialog box, I see that one of the options for window type is
       Desktop. What is a desktop window?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. A window defined as Desktop will become the main FoxPro screen.
       If you look at the generated code for a desktop window, you
       will see that a new window is not defined. Rather, a MODIFY
       WINDOW SCREEN command is generated to modify the attributes of
       the main FoxPro screen. Any subsequent windows that are created
       by using the DEFINE WINDOW ... IN SCREEN command will be
       children of the desktop window.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. When I'm generating screens, I don't see any code-
<P><PRE>       generation options. Do these options exist?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. The Generate Screen dialog box contains a More button.
       Choose this button to view the code-generation options.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Every time I run my screen, it seems that certain
<P><PRE>       databases are opened and closed automatically. How can I
       prevent this from happening?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. When you save a screen for the first time, you have the option
       of saving environment information. If you choose to save this
       information, the screen file will record all open databases,
       active indexes, and active relations. When the screen is
       generated and run, the databases, indexes, and relations in the
       screen's environment will be restored. If you inadvertently
       saved the environment information when you created the screen,
       the screen program will restore an environment that you may not
       want.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       To clear a screen's environment, choose Layout from the Screen
       menu. In the Screen Layout dialog box, choose the Environment
       button, and then choose the Clear button.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       If you do not want to clear the environment but want to prevent
       the opening and closing of environment files, choose the More
       button in the Generate Screen dialog box. Clear the Open Files
       and Close Files check boxes.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I've designed a screen and would now like to add color to
<P><PRE>       my screen objects. How can I do this?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. To specify colors, first select the object or a group of
       objects. To modify the background color of the object, choose
       Fill Color from the Object menu. To modify the outline and text
       of an object, choose Pen Color from the Object menu. Setting
       Fill Color or Pen Color to Automatic means the Macintosh
       default color sets will be used.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       To change the background of the entire screen, choose Layout
       from the Screen menu, and then choose the Color button. You can
       select a color, or you can select a wallpaper pattern by
       choosing the Wallpaper button, and then selecting a PICT or
       .BMP (bitmap) file.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why can't I type as many characters in an input field as
<P><PRE>       it appears will fit?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The input field is using a proportional font. In a proportional
       font, each character is given as much horizontal space as it
       needs and no more. For example, a lowercase ''f'' requires much
       less space than an uppercase ''W.''
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       When an input field displays in a screen, FoxPro calculates the
       display width of the field by multiplying the number of
       characters in the table field structure by the average size of
       a character in the specified font. If the field is filled with
       characters that are wider than average, the characters don't
       all fit within the display width of the input field, and
       therefore the characters scroll. If the field is filled with
       characters that are narrower than average, the characters don't
       fill the display width of the input field.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How do I control the type of data a memory variable will
<P><PRE>       contain, including its length?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. In the Field dialog box, you can use the Format button to set
       the characteristics of the data entered, including its length.
       For more specific information, see the FUNCTION and PICTURE
       clauses portion of the documentation about the @ ... SAY
       command in the "Language Reference".
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Working with Pictures</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. When I select the Push Button tool in the Screen Design
<P><PRE>       window, I have the option of selecting pictures for my buttons.
       What file formats are supported?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. FoxPro for Macintosh allows you to use PICT and bitmap (.BMP)
       files. You can also use pictures in place of radio button and
       check box prompts.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How can I display a .BMP (bitmap) or a PICT object stored
<P><PRE>       in a general field?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Use the Picture tool to display the contents of a general
       field. The Field tool can't be used to display a picture.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I used the Picture tool to add a picture field to my
<P><PRE>       screen. How do the options under If Picture And Frame Different
       Size affect the display of the picture?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The following options apply only when the picture and frame are
       different sizes:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       - Clip Picture retains the original dimensions of the picture.
<PRE></PRE>         If the picture is larger than the frame, only a portion of
         the image is displayed, beginning with the top-left portion
         of the picture. Any portion of the picture that extends
         beyond the frame is hidden.

       - Scale Picture - Retain Shape retains the overall shape of the
         picture but fills as much of the frame as possible. The
         picture is protected from vertical or horizontal distortion.

       - Scale Picture - Fill The Frame fills the frame completely.
         The picture fills the frame even at the cost of horizontal
         and vertical distortion.
