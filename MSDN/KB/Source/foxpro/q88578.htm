The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft FoxPro versions 2.0 and later for MS-DOS can run in either the
Standard or Extended version when the computer has an 80386SX or higher
processor. However, the two FoxPro versions differ in their memory use.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Standard Version Memory Use</h3>
 
<P>
The code for the Standard version is packaged in two pieces: the root
portion (in the FOXPRO.EXE file) and a collection of additional code
segments (in the FOXPRO.OVL file).
<P>
When FoxPro starts up, the root portion is loaded into memory and certain
other fixed-sized memory allocations occur. The code and data require about
290K of memory. The collection of code segments requires approximately 1.1
MB of storage on the disk.
<P>
After the root portion is loaded into memory, the balance of conventional
memory (memory addressed below 640K), any available upper memory blocks
(UMBs), and 64K of expanded memory (for systems running according to the
Lotus-Intel Microsoft [LIM] version 4.0 Expanded Memory Specification
[EMS]) is available to FoxPro as a general-purpose memory pool that can
contain any user and system data (for example, BROWSE sessions, code
segments, memory variables, windows, and so on) and I/O buffers. Any other
EMS memory is used to hold I/O buffers and to store inactive code segments.
<P>
FoxPro loads additional code segments on demand. These segments float
freely throughout all available memory, in both the general and expanded
memory pools. When free memory is required for other purposes, the least-
recently-used (LRU) code segment is removed from memory.
<P>
Because the root segment is relatively small, the Standard version can run
with less than 400K of free memory. However, for most applications, 512K is
a more realistic minimum memory size. For all applications, additional
memory can greatly improve execution speed.
<P>
<P><h3>Extended Version Memory Use</h3>
 
<P>
Memory in the First Megabyte of Address Space:

<UL><LI>80K is used to store a portion of the MS-DOS Extender application.

<LI>If the CONFIG.FP file contains the DOSMEM=&lt;nn&gt;K statement, the
   specified amount of memory is retained for later use when free
   memory is remapped. This memory then becomes available as extended
   memory.

<LI>A buffer is allocated from the remaining free memory. The maximum
   size of the buffer is 60K, depending on the amount of free memory
   available. When the RUN command is executed, FoxPro reallocates
   this buffer to make more memory available to the program specified
   in the RUN command.
<P>
   NOTE: If the amount of space reserved in the DOSMEM statement is too
   great, degraded I/O performance can result because this buffer is too
   small or eliminated entirely.

<LI>If the CONFIG.FP file contains the DOSMEM statement, the balance of
   conventional memory (addressed in the first 640K) is remapped and
   becomes available as extended memory.

<LI>FoxPro does not use any UMBs.
<P>
</UL>Extended Memory:

<UL><LI>All the code in the Extended version and the remainder of the MS-DOS
   Extender application is loaded into extended memory and certain
   fixed memory allocations are made. These allocations require
   approximately 1,450K of extended memory.

<LI>The balance of extended memory is available for general use.
<P>
</UL>Because the Extended version of FoxPro is a true 32-bit product, some
internal data structures (for example, memory variables, windows, and so
on) require slightly more memory in the Extended version than in the
Standard version. Therefore, a program generally requires somewhat more
memory to run in the Extended version than in the Standard version.
<P>
<P><h3>Reasons to Use Each Version</h3>
 
<P>
In the Standard version, FoxPro code segments are loaded into memory on
demand; they need not be in memory at all times. Also, the Standard version
does not reserve space for the MS-DOS Extender application. Therefore, for
a given amount of memory installed in a machine, about 1.1 MB more memory
is potentially available to store I/O buffers when the Standard version is
running than when the Extended version is running. However, not all the
additional memory may actually be available to store buffers. When a large
application is running, much of the memory may be used to store code
segments or other data.
<P>
Because the speed of an I/O operation can be very sensitive to the amount
of free memory, an I/O-intensive program might greatly benefit from the
additional memory provided by the Standard version. Obviously, an extra
megabyte of buffer memory will significantly affect performance on a
machine with only 3 MB of memory installed. For this reason, the Standard
version will most likely run an I/O benchmark faster than the Extended
version on a machine with limited memory. However, the marginal advantage
provided by this additional buffer of memory becomes much smaller as
additional memory is installed.
<P>
However, if an application consists primarily of data entry and the maximum
interface response is required, even when many new features are used, the
Extended version may be a better choice, even on a machine with a limited
amount of memory. Because the Extended version loads all FoxPro code into
memory, segment-loading overhead is eliminated.
<P>
In the Extended version, the size of the programs, the number of windows,
string storage space, the number of memory variables, and so on, are
limited only by the amount of memory on the machine. In the Standard
version, a maximum of 460K of total free memory is available for general
purposes. Therefore, a very large or complex application, particularly one
that heavily uses the SQL interface, mandates use of the Extended version.
<P>
On a machine with 3 MB or less of installed memory, it is possible to
develop programs that run in the Standard version but that do not run
in the Extended version because the internal data structures are larger.
However, this situation is quite rare.
<P>
By default, demand paging is activated when the Extended version is running
on any machine that has less than 2.5 MB of total memory. The overhead
imposed by demand paging becomes larger as free memory becomes smaller.
Less memory requires more swapping. NOTE: To disable the Extended version's
demand paging feature, add the DOSMEM=ON statement to the CONFIG.FP file.
Keep in mind that when demand paging is disabled, FoxPro is unable to run
programs or load code (API) libraries.
<P>
If a machine has 4 MB or more of total memory, using the Extended version
is recommended. However, no matter how much memory exists, the Standard
version may have more memory available to hold buffers than the Extended
version does. For this reason, it is sometimes possible to develop an I/O
benchmark in which the Standard version runs faster.
<P>
If a machine has between 3 and 4 MB of total memory, the Extended version
is usually better.
<P>
If the machine has between 2 and 3 MB of total memory, the version choice
depends largely on the specific application.
<P>
If the machine has 2 MB or less of total memory, the Standard version is
recommended.
