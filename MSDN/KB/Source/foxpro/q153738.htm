The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using SET MACDESKTOP OFF, user-defined windows are confined to the
limits of the Visual FoxPro screen. This is analogous to the application
window in Visual FoxPro for Windows. However, the Properties sheet and
Project Manager are special elements of the Visual FoxPro development
environment and are handled differently. There are situations where the
Properties sheet or Project Manager may not behave consistently with other
windows in respect to SET MACDESKTOP OFF. This may result in the Properties
sheet or Program Manager being obscured by the Visual FoxPro Screen.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Properties Sheet:
<P>
This limitation is a result of the Properties sheet being shared by
multiple windows, and the need to guarantee its accessibility to all
designers. For instance, if one designer is activated IN MACDESKTOP and
another is not, there may be a chance for the Properties sheet to be hidden
when using the designer.
<P>
Project Manager:
<P>
This behavior is due to the hybrid sense of the Project Manager. It shares
behavior with both toolbars and windows. Therefore, if the Project Manager
were confined to the Visual FoxPro Screen, it would not be dockable.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Use the configuration file special setting MACSCREEN = OFF or SET
   MACDESKTOP ON, then close the Visual FoxPro screen.

<P><LI>Use the pushpin on the Properties sheet to secure it at the topmost
   level.

<P><LI>Dock the Project Manager, or tear off a tab and use the pushpin to
   bring it forward.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Properties sheet:

<OL><P><LI>SET MACDESKTOP OFF.

<P><LI>Modify a new or existing form.

<P><LI>Open the properties sheet and unpin it, making sure that the sheet
   overlaps the Visual FoxPro Screen.

<P><LI>Click on the Visual FoxPro Screen, causing it to come forward.
<P>
   The Properties sheet will fall behind the Visual FoxPro Screen, even
   though the MACDESKTOP is set to OFF.
<P>
</OL>Project Manager:

<OL><P><LI>SET MACDESKTOP OFF.

<P><LI>Modify a new or existing project.

<P><LI>Make sure the project is not docked and partially overlaps the Visual
   FoxPro Screen.

<P><LI>Click on the Visual FoxPro Screen, causing it to come forward.
<P>
   The Project Manager will fall behind the Visual FoxPro Screen, even
   though MACDESKTOP is set to OFF.
