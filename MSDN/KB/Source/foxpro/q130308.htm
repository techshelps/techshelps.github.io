The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the SHOW method to make one form of a formset modal, the form
remains a modeless form.
<P>
If you make a form modal, the user should not be able to move to any other
window in the application. A modeless form allows the user to click any
other form in the application.
<P>
Modal forms are used to display custom dialogs, warnings, or error
messages.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design. The SHOW method affects the modality of the entire
formset. You cannot use the SHOW method to make one form within a
formset modal. You must make the entire formset modal.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The easiest way to handle modal forms is to make them separate form files,
instead of part of a formset. The following steps create two forms. When a
command button on the first form is clicked, the second form appears. The
user cannot activate the other window until the command button on the
second form is clicked.

<OL><P><LI>Create a form called frmModls. Add a label to the form that has the
   caption "User input screen - modeless." Add a command button to the
   form, and add the following code to the click event of the command
   button:
<P>
   DO FORM frmModal
   frmModal.show(1)

<P><LI>Save the first form. Create a second form called frmModal. Add a label
   to this form that has the caption "Modal dialog screen." Add a command
   button to the form, and place the following code in the click event:
<P>
   THISFORM.RELEASE
   frmModls.show(2)
<P>
   Alternately, set the WindowType property of the frmModal form to 1 for
   Modal. This change must be made at design time; it cannot be made at run
   time. Use the WindowType property if the form will always be displayed
   in a modal state. Use the Show method to change a form to modal if the
   form should sometimes be displayed in a modal state and sometimes in a
   modeless state.

<P><LI>Save and close the form. Then type the following command in the Command
   window:
<P>
   DO FORM frmModls
<P>
</OL>When the form appears, you should be able to access menu options such as
Cut, Copy, and Paste from the Edit menu, and click into other windows such
as the Command Window or View Window.
<P>
If you click the command button, the form named frmModal should appear. You
should not be able to click into the Command or View windows, and most menu
options should be grayed out.
<P>
If you click the command button on the second form, the form should
disappear. The form named frmModLs should reappear, and you should once
again be able to activate other windows.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to use the SHOW method to display a modal formset, you must set
the modality of the entire formset as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   THISFORMSET.SHOW(1)   &amp;&amp; to make the formset modal

</PRE></OL>This code may be placed in the Init method of the Formset or within the
click event of a command button depending on where or when a modal screen
set is needed.
<P>
The formset's WindowType property may also be used.
