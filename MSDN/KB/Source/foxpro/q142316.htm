The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for UNIX, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
While you run a .prg file, an error is reported but a line that did not
cause the error is highlighted.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs only under very specific, but difficult to predict
circumstances. The .prg file is divided into 512 byte blocks. This causes
the line numbering to be thrown off by one every time the last byte in a
block is the carriage return character: CHR(13).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of the following methods to correct the problem:

<UL><LI>Insert a character into or delete a character from the line preceeding
   the line that was highlighted when the error was displayed. It can be
   any character or comment, as long as it does not affect the function of
   the code.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the following code to locate the line that contains the offending
   CHR(13):
<P>
   CHECKIT.PRG
   -----------
   parameter fname
   set talk off
   clear
   fh=fopen(fname)
   do while not feof(fh)
<P><PRE>      data=fread(fh,512)
      if LEN(data)=512
<PRE></PRE>         boundry=asc(right(data,1))
         if boundry=13
            @12,10 say right(data,60)
            ??CHR(7)
            =inkey(0)
         ENDIF
      ENDIF
   enddo
   =fclose(fh)

   Call the code for each program that causes the problem, as follows:

   DO CHECKIT.PRG WITH "TEST.PRG"

   Once the line with the offending chr(13) is located, do one of the
   following:

    - Insert an extra character into the line.

      -or-

    - Delete a character from the line.

</PRE></UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
While you run a FoxPro program, if a line of code causes an error, that
line is highlighted when the error message is displayed.
<P>
In some cases, however, the line preceeding the line that caused the error
is highlighted. For example, a "?" command on line #2 produces an
"Unrecognized command verb" error. When the error message is displayed,
Line #1 will be highlighted instead of Line #2. You may also notice that
when running Debug, FoxPro does not run the highlighted line. This type of
error may come and go as lines in the effected .prg file are edited.
<P>
