The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.6, 2.6a
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot exit a field in a BROWSE by pressing TAB, SHIFT+TAB, ENTER, or
an arrow key when the MARK delimiter has been set to nothing, even though
there is not a VALID clause on the field.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>USE the INVOICES.DBF table in the TUTORIAL subdirectory.

<P><LI>BROWSE the table.

<P><LI>Delete the data in the IDATE field of records 1, 3, and 5.

<P><LI>Leaving the Browse window open, type the following command in the
   Command window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SET MARK TO ' '
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Make sure there is only one space between the quotation marks.

<P><LI>Select the Browse window. Note that the slashes in the IDATE field have
   been replaced by spaces.

<P><LI>In the Command window, type the following command to reset SET MARK to
   its default functionality:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SET MARK TO
</PRE><P>
</OL>Note that the slashes have reappeared in all the nonempty fields, but the
empty fields in records 1, 3, and 5 still have not had the proper delimiter
(or MARK) restored to them.
<P>
In addition, if you were to move into one of those empty fields and begin
entering data, the delimiter is not only still not restored, but you won't
be allowed to leave the field while there is any data in it.
<P>
To properly reset this functionality to its desired behavior, you must quit
and restart FoxPro.
