<P>
You may sometimes need to change the contents of a .vcx or .scx record to

editing. This article explains the file structure of the table that
contains the .vcx or .scx information and gives a description of the usage
and examples of the field contents.

Description: VCX/SCX - Used to associate a Specific platform for an object.
In single-platform tables, every object has one record per platform. Cross-

are distinguished by the Platform Field. For records that do not relate to
a specific class or object, the Platform field contains the string
"COMMENT". The header record (record #1) has Platform="COMMENT".
Example: "WINDOWS"
<P>
Field Name: UniqueID
Type: C(10)
Description: VCX/SCX - Unique ID code for individual classes and objects.
Related cross-platform records share the same UniqueID value. For records
that do not relate to a specific class or object, the UniqueID field
contains information that describes the type of record. The header record
(record #1) has Unique="Class". SCX - Same as VCX except the header record
(record #1) has uniqueID="Screen".
