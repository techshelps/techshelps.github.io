<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using the Mail Merge Wizard in FoxPro to merge data into
Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows, you receive error messages.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Mail Merge Wizard uses the WordBasic programming language when merging
data into Word 6.0. In some versions of Word that have been localized for
markets outside the United States, the WordBasic programming language is
also localized. This means that certain WordBasic commands that are valid
in the U.S. version of Word 6.0 are not valid in non-U.S. versions of Word
6.0.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The Mail Merge Wizard has been modified to support both French and German
versions of Word 6.0. If the French or German versions of Word 6.0 are
being used, you must use the French or German version of FoxPro, which
contains a Mail Merge Wizard that has been specially modified to support
French and German WordBasic.
<P>
The Mail Merge Wizard has not been modified to support other localized
versions of Word 6.0. If the version of Word 6.0 currently in use is not
for the French, German, or English language, the Mail Merge Wizard may not
function properly. In this instance, choose the Other radio button under
Select A Word Processor (in the second Mail Merge Wizard screen). Choosing
Other creates a comma-delimited ASCII text file that can then be imported
into Word.
