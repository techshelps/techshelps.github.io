The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a, and 2.60
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro will run most FoxBASE+ programs without change. FoxPro is also
compatible with dBASE 4, which is not completely compatible with FoxBASE+.
Therefore, FoxPro must be informed which type of compatibility is desired
by the developer. The information below describes how to ensure nearly
complete FoxBASE+ compatibility.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following command (the default) will allow FoxPro to run most programs
written in FoxBASE+ and dBASE 3 without change:
<P>
<PRE>   SET COMPATIBLE TO FOXPLUS

</PRE>Aside from issuing this command, you must make a few other changes to
ensure nearly complete FoxBASE+ compatibility. These changes are described
below and in Chapter 17 of the "Developer's Guide."
<P>
<P><h3>Changing the Configuration of FoxPro</h3>
 
<P>
In the GOODIES\MISC directory is a special configuration file called
CONFIG.FOX. This file configures FoxPro to be almost completely FoxBASE+
compatible. To use this file, rename it CONFIG.FP, or incorporate its
contents into a new or currently active CONFIG.FP file.
<P>
<P><h3>Emulating FoxBASE+ Keystroke Assignments</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro's built-in keystroke shortcuts are very similar to those of
FoxBASE+/Mac and are also similar to those found in IBM's System
Application Architecture (SAA) specification. However, the shortcuts are
very different from those in FoxBASE+ for MS-DOS.
<P>
Fortunately, FoxPro's keystroke macro facility makes it easy to completely
emulate FoxBASE+'s keystroke shortcuts. A set of keyboard macros that
emulate FoxBASE+'s behavior is provided. These macros are in file called
FOXPLUS.FKY, which is located in the GOODIES\MISC directory.
<P>
If programs rely on the exact keystrokes used to operate FoxBASE+ [and the
READKEY() codes they generate], FOXPLUS.FKY should be used.
<P>
To activate these macros, use the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   RESTORE MACROS FROM FOXPLUS.FKY

</PRE>To automatically load these macros on startup, rename FOXPLUS.FKY to
DEFAULT.FKY and place it in the same directory as FOXPRO.EXE.
<P>
<P><h3>SET Options Required for FoxBASE+ Emulation</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   SET NOTIFY OFF     &amp;&amp; Turns off FoxPro system messages.
   SET STATUS ON      &amp;&amp; Turns on old-style status bar.
   SET SCOREBOARD ON  &amp;&amp; Turns on old-style scoreboard.
   SET BRSTATUS ON    &amp;&amp; Status bar will appear with BROWSE.
   SET MACKEY TO      &amp;&amp; Disables "define macro" key, usually F10.

</PRE>Some of the above settings, while required for complete compatibility, are
not really desirable for use in FoxPro. A good example is SET STATUS ON,
which activates the old-style status bar. Although this is not really
useful in native FoxPro mode, it is included for backward compatibility.
<P>
<P><h3>Unavoidable Incompatibilities</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro is as perfectly compatible with FoxBASE+ as possible, given that it
is an entirely different product. However, some of FoxPro's extensions have
introduced a few minor areas where incompatibilities are inescapable.

<OL><P><LI>FoxPro detects a few error conditions that are ignored by FoxBASE+. In
   these conditions, programs written in FoxBASE+ will not operate as
   before but will generate error messages. (For example, FoxBASE+ permits
   arrays to have names that later became functions in FoxPro, such as an
   array named POPUP.)

<P><LI>FoxPro has many new functions. If the name of one of these built-in
   FoxPro functions has been used in an existing FoxBASE+ application as
   the name of a user-defined function (UDF), FoxPro will naturally
   interpret the name as that of the built-in function and will not execute
   the UDF [a common example is the LOOKUP() function].

<P><LI>There have been reports of instances where an existing FoxBASE+
   application used the following technique to initialize a string to the
   null string (that is, a string containing no characters):
<P>
<P><PRE>      mystring = CHR(0)
</PRE><P>
   In FoxBASE+, this code is equivalent to the normal technique:
<P>
<P><PRE>      mystring = ""
</PRE><P>
   However, in FoxPro, which permits the null character to be stored in
   strings, the first approach actually results in a string containing one
   character, CHR(0), the null character. In short, if applications have
   been written to rely on the fact that it is impossible to insert the
   NULL character in a string in FoxBASE+, the application will not work
   properly under FoxPro.
<P>
<P><PRE>    NOTE: In FoxPro 2.6, it is possible to put null values into logical and
    numeric fields (not memory variables).
</PRE>
<P><LI>Since FoxPro's interface and interactive facilities (such as BROWSE and
   EDIT/CHANGE) are entirely different from those of FoxBASE+, programs
   that rely on the precise physical appearance of these facilities in
   FoxBASE+ will not operate identically in FoxPro.
