<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The record marker is the small box on the leftmost side of each record in
the grid. There will be a black arrow in the record marker of the current
record if the grid has the focus. The record marker of a grid does not move
when scrolling though a table if the grid does not have the focus as the
record pointer is being moved.
<P>
If the grid does not have focus, then the record marker will not appear
beside the current record until the grid receives the focus. The record
marker box is available only if the RecordMark property of the grid is set
to true. Use the SetFocus property to make the record marker of the grid
refresh every time a record is moved.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

<P><h3>Step-by-Step Demonstration</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new form and place a grid on it. While the mouse pointer is
   over the grid, click the right mouse button, and then click the Builder
   to place fields in the grid easily.

<P><LI>Place a command button on the form and add the following code to its
   Click event:
<P>
   SKIP

<P><LI> Run the form and note that the record marker doesn't appear in the grid
   until the grid is clicked.

<P><LI>Close the form, and then modify it, adding the following line of code
   after the SKIP command in the Click event of the command button:
<P>
   THISFORM.GRID1.SETFOCUS()

<P><LI>Run the form and click the command button. Note that the record marker
   moves as the record pointer of the table is moved with the command
   button.
<P>
</OL><h3>Adding the Next and Previous Buttons</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using command buttons created by the Form Wizard, place the
following code in the Next button of the command button group:
<P>
<PRE>   TXTBTNS.CMDNEXT::CLICK
   THISFORM.GRID1.SETFOCUS()

</PRE></OL>This will call the code in the Click event of the base class of the Next
button. To make the Prior button work, change the CMDNEXT to CMDPRIOR in
the above code.
<P>
Setting the focus to the grid each time that the record pointer is moved
allows the record marker to be updated. If another object on the form is
clicked, the record marker will disappear until the grid receives the focus
again.
