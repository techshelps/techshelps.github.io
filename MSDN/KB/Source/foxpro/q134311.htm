The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A type -192 error is received. The actual text of the error messages
received may vary depending on what is causing the error.
<P>
If a FoxPro PPC executable created by the user or by FoxPro is installed on
a 68K Macintosh and double-clicked, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The application program "&lt;name of program&gt;" could not be opened,
   because an error of type -192 occurred.

</PRE>Double-clicking an Application (.APP) file created with FoxPro for
Macintosh and installed on a 68K Macintosh using distribution disks created
with the FoxPro Setup Wizard results in this error:
<P>
<PRE>   The application program "FoxPPC26.ESL" could not be opened,
   because an error of type -192 occurred.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors are caused by trying to run native PPC code on a 68k
Macintosh.
<P>
In the case of the second error message, it is specifically caused by
having the FoxPPC26.ESL file installed with the application on a 68K
Macintosh. The application file finds the FoxPPC26.ESL file before it finds
the FoxMac26.ESL file, which is the support library that the application
needs to use.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In the case of the PPC version of FoxPro itself or a user-created PPC EXE
file installed on a 68K Macintosh, remove the program file and install a
68K version.
<P>
In the case of a distributed application returning this error message,
there are at least three possible solutions:

<UL><LI>Manually delete the FoxPPC26.ESL file and empty the Trash.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Build a 68K .EXE file instead. The support library is built into the
   .EXE file and the .ESL files do not need to be distributed with it. The
   Setup Wizard will, however, provide the option of including the support
   libraries on the distribution diskettes. This question should be
   answered "No" unless there is a specific reason to include the support
   libraries with the .EXE file.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Modify the Setup Wizard to exclude the FoxPPC26.ESL file on distribution
   disks. This option is useful if the application is not going to be
   installed on PowerMacs. Or you can use two different versions of the
   Setup Wizard to build disks specific to the type of Macintosh the
   application is to be installed on, PowerMac or 68K Mac. The steps to
   modify the Setup Wizard are as follows:
<P>
   NOTE: This option is for experienced developer's only. Microsoft Product
   Support doesn't support custom changes to the Setup Wizard.
<P>
   1. Make a copy of the entire DK Wizard folder that is found in the
<P><PRE>      FoxPro folder. Put it in a safe place.
</PRE><P>
   2. In FoxPro, open the Setup.pjx project found in the DK Wizard folder.
<P>
   3. Edit the Required table/dbf that will be listed in the project.
<P>
   4. Ensure that the last record in the Required table has FoxPPC26.esl in
<P><PRE>      the Name field. Mark that record for deletion, and Pack the table.
</PRE><P>
   5. Rebuild the Setup.app, making sure to replace the original one that
<P><PRE>      is found in the main FoxPro folder.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The FoxPro version 2.6 setup program (for FoxPro itself, not the setup used
by the Distribution Kit), when run on a 68K Macintosh, only allows
installation of the 68k version or the combined 68K/PPC version. Both will
run on a 68K Mac.
<P>
It is possible that an original 68K Macintosh may have a PowerPC board
installed in it. If the FoxPro setup program is run while the PPC board is
active, the PPC version only of FoxPro could be installed. If the PPC board
is disabled and the Macintosh is hence converted back into a 68K Macintosh,
the Type -192 error will be received when starting the PPC version of
FoxPro.
<P>
Install the combined version on a Macintosh with a PPC board if there is a
possibility that the board will be disabled at some point.
<P>
In order for an Application file to run on a computer that doesn't have
FoxPro installed on it, at least one of the FoxPro support libraries needs
to be on the computer. Preferably the support library should be in the same
folder as the FoxPro application. The names of the two support libraries
are FoxMac26.ESL and FoxPPC26.ESL, with the later file being the one for
use on a PowerMac. The FoxMac26.ESL will also run on a PowerMac but the
FoxPPC26.ESL will not run on a 68K Macintosh.
