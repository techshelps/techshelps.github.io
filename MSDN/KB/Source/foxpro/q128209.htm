<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Reports, labels, and screens are in a design mode when they are opened
through the menu or through the MODIFY command from the Command window.
Reports and labels can toggle from design mode to print preview while
screens toggle between design mode and tab order.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The report designer and the Label Designer each have two modes of operation
called the design mode and the preview mode. The design mode is shown
initially. The Page Header, Detail, and Page Footer bands are displayed so
you can modify the fields and layout of the report or label.
<P>
Print preview is the second mode and can be accessed through the menu. From
the File menu, choose Print Preview, or from the View menu, choosh Preview.
There is also a print preview button on the standard toolbar. Print preview
allows you to see how the report will look printed without actually sending
the report to the printer.
<P>
To toggle back to the report design mode, choose Design from the View menu,
or choose the Close Preview button from the print preview toolbar. Because
design and print preview are two modes of the report designer, if you
choose Close from the Command menu or press CTRL+F4, you will close both
the design and print preview modes of the report designer.
<P>
The form designer also has two modes of operation. As with the report
designer, the design mode is initially displayed when creating a new screen
or modifying an existing one. The design mode is where objects can be
placed on the screen and code entered for different events. The second mode
is tab order. The sequence of object selection when tabbing through a
screen is set when the form designer is in tab order mode. The first two
buttons on the form designer toolbar allow you to toggle between design
mode and tab order. The View menu also allows you to choose between the
design and tab order modes.
