The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Choosing About FoxPro from the System menu returns a screen similar
to the following:
<P>
<PRE>     Total Memory              5,000,000

     EMS Memory                4,000,000
     First 64K of EMS Use      Standard Memory

     MS-DOS Memory              N/A

     Memory in Use             40,752

</PRE>These figures may differ from the available figures returned by the MEM
command in MS-DOS version 5.0 or by other memory utilities.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The statistics returned by About FoxPro are calculated as follows:
<P>
Total Memory indicates how much memory available is available to FoxPro
after FoxPro is loaded. This includes conventional memory, memory available
to FoxPro in the high memory area between 640K and 1 MB, and the 64K page
frame of LIM 4.0 compatible expanded memory, if available. This number is
equivalent to the value returned by the ?SYS(1001) function.
<P>
EMS Memory indicates how much expanded memory is available on the system.
This includes either physical memory that meets the LIM 4.0 expanded memory
system (EMS) standard, or extended memory that is configured as expanded
memory by using an expanded memory emulator such as EMM386.EXE, QEMM, or
386MAX. This number is equivalent to the value returned by the SYS(23)
function.
<P>
FoxPro uses the first 64K of expanded memory as general-purpose memory to
manage Browse windows, user-defined windows, menus, memory variables,
programs, and so on. Any additional expanded memory is used to speed up
file I/O and to store FoxPro code in memory to reduce the number of times
code must be read from disk.
<P>
First 64K of EMS Use: If expanded memory is not available on the
workstation, the word "None" appears for this value. If expanded memory is
available on the workstation, this figure indicates the amount of standard
memory.
<P>
DOS Memory Available: This figure is valid only if the following two
conditions are met: the Extended (32-bit) version of FoxPro is running and
the workstation has at least 1.5 MB of free EMS memory. MS-DOS Memory
indicates the amount of conventional memory (0-640K) available to the
Extended version of FoxPro.
<P>
Normally, all user activity in the Extended version of FoxPro occurs in
EMS. If only a very small amount of EMS memory is available, the system can
be configured to also use any available conventional memory for user
activity. However, by using conventional memory, an application may not be
able to access any API functions. Because printer drivers call an API
function, selecting this option may preclude using any printer drivers.
<P>
It is also not possible to run MS-DOS commands from the Command window in
the Extended version of FoxPro unless some MS-DOS memory is available. To
make MS-DOS memory available in the Extended version, add one of the
following lines to the CONFIG.FP file:
<P>
<PRE>   DOSMEM=&lt;memory&gt;, where &lt;memory&gt; lists the amount of conventional
                    memory, in kilobytes (K), to make available.

</PRE>Memory in Use: This value indicates the amount of memory used by
FoxPro to store data.
