Part 1: New Features in FoxPro 2.6
 
<P>
Microsoft FoxPro version 2.6 includes the following
new features:
<P>
<PRE>   *  A Catalog Manager interface that provides convenient
      access to database files and functions, and enables you
      to convert dBASE(R) files easily.

      For more information on converting dBASE file:

      * Choose dBASE Help... from the Help menu.
      -OR-
      * Search for Switching from dBASE in online Help.

   *  A collection of wizards that simplify common database
      tasks.

   *  Language additions that provide dBASE IV(R) language
      compatibility.

</PRE>FoxPro version 2.6 includes existing print
documentation from version 2.5, as well as significant
updates to the Help file that describe new 2.6
functionality. For more information, see the What's New
Since FoxPro 2.5 Help topic.
<P>
Important:  The FoxPro Catalog Manager is not available in
the 16-bit Standard version of FoxPro. To convert dBASE III(R)
and dBASE IV files in the 16-bit Standard version, select
Convert dBASE files... from the Run menu. For more help
converting files, press F1 while in this dialog.
 
<P>
<P>
 
Part 2: Installation Notes
 
<P>
There are three types of installation for FoxPro for
MS-DOS: Normal Installation, Administrative Installation
and Workstation Installation. Instructions for Normal
Installation are in the FoxPro Installation and
Configuration manual. For information about Administrative
and Workstation Installation, see INSTALL.TXT on FoxPro
for MS-DOS Disk 1.
<P>
Installing FoxPro on the Microsoft Windows NT(TM)
operating system
 
FoxPro for MS-DOS cannot install in an MS-DOS window within
Microsoft Windows NT. To install FoxPro for MS-DOS, you must
be able to boot to a separate MS-DOS partition.
 
<P>
<P>
 
Part 3: New and Enhanced Commands and Functions
 
Several commands and functions are new to FoxPro 2.6,
and some have been enhanced to provide additional
compatibility with dBASE IV(R). For additional information
about these commands and functions, see the New and Enhanced
Commands and Functions Help topic.

Part 4: Notes about the Catalog Manager
 
<P>
<P><h3>Reserved Names in the Catalog Manager</h3>
 
Like any other FoxPro application, the Catalog Manager calls
and runs procedures and programs whose names may interfere
with other user-defined procedures and programs.
<P>
When you execute a program or procedure, FoxPro searches for
the program or procedure in a specific order. This order
includes the current file as well as programs that were
executed prior to the current one, including the Catalog
Manager itself.
<P>
Below is a list of procedure and program names that can cause
errors if run from within the Catalog Manager.

<P><h3>API Library Routines and the Catalog Manager</h3>
 
If you use any routines that are called when an API library
is opened or closed, you should note the following Catalog
Manager behaviors.
<P>
The Catalog Manager opens and closes API libraries on
these occasions:
<P>
* When the Catalog Manager is started, all API
<PRE>  libraries are closed.

</PRE>* When a program is run from within the Catalog
<PRE>  Manager, all API libraries that were open before
  the Catalog Manager started are opened. When the program
  ends the API libraries are closed.

</PRE>* When the Catalog Manager is exited, all API
<PRE>  libraries that were open before the Catalog
  Manager started are opened.
</PRE> 
<P>
<P>
 
Part 5: Notes about Wizards
 
<P><h3>Running Wizards in the 16-bit Standard version of FoxPro</h3>
 
To run the FoxPro Wizards in the 16-bit Standard version
of FoxPro you need to have at least 525KB of free
conventional memory. You can also run the Wizards in the
32-bit Extended version of FoxPro.
<P>
<P><h3>Memo and General Fields and the Label Wizard</h3>
 
Memo and General fields cannot be included in a label
created with the Label Wizard. To add Memo and General
fields you must modify the label with the Label Writer.
<P>
<P><h3>Modifying Wizard-Created Items in Microsoft Windows NT(TM)</h3>
 
If you are using the Microsoft Windows NT operating system,
you can use wizards to create tables, queries,
screens, reports, or labels. To modify items created with a
wizard you must use the appropriate FoxPro power tool, such
as the Report Writer, Screen Builder, or RQBE.
 
<P>
<P>
 
Part 6: Macro Key Support in FoxPro 2.6
 
In FoxPro 2.6, the key combinations ALT+1 to ALT+9 cannot
be used to define macros. For a list of key combinations
supported in FoxPro 2.6 see the ON KEY LABEL topic in Help.
 
<P>
=======================================+++++++++=========
<P><h2>Part 7: Differences Between FoxPro and dBASE Format Files</h2>
 
<P>
Please note these differences between dBASE and FoxPro 2.6
format files:
<P>
SET STATUS - A dBASE format file automatically contains a
SET STATUS ON command. The FoxPro 2.6 BROWSE FORMAT command
ignores it. Therefore, in order for messages to display in
the FoxPro status bar after you issue an APPEND command, you
should remove SET STATUS ON. Messages will then appear in
the status bar or, if the status bar is turned off, in the
WAIT window.
<P>
BROWSE FORMAT - In FoxPro 2.6, BROWSE FORMAT does not wait
for a &lt;space&gt; before allowing the user to re-enter data.
(In dBASE, after a user enters invalid information, both
APPEND and BROWSE FORMAT require the user to press the
Spacebar before re-entering data.)
<P>
In FoxPro 2.6, SAY output is displayed individually in its
own column.
<P>
RANGE Clause - FoxPro 2.6 doesn't support RANGE clauses of
Character type. If you have a RANGE clause on a Character
field in your dBASE format file, you should remove it.
Otherwise, FoxPro displays a syntax error when you issue a
SET FORMAT TO command.
 
<P>
 
Part 8: Importing Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets to FoxPro
 
<P>
FoxPro can import spreadsheet files from Microsoft
Excel version 4.0. To import spreadsheets from Microsoft
Excel version 5.0, you must first save them as version
4.0 files. Columns from the spreadsheet become fields
in the table, and rows from the spreadsheet become records
in the table.
<P>
 
<P>
 
Part 9: International and Cross-Platform Recommendations
 
See the International and Cross-Platform Features topic in
Help for the latest information on code pages and collation
sequences.
<P>
<P><h3>Tagging Code Pages to Tables in the Catalog Manager</h3>
 
Note:  This section only applies if you are using code
pages for cross-platform development.
<P>
To ensure that accented characters in a table are displayed
correctly on the current platform, the table must be tagged
with a code page. In Catalog Manager, to tag a code page to
a table that does not have one, make sure the following
are true:

<OL><P><LI>SET EXCLUSIVE is ON. The exclusive setting can
<P><PRE>    be set in the Catalog Manager Settings dialog.
</OL></PRE>2. The configuration file (CONFIG.FP) includes the
<PRE>    line CODEPAGE = AUTO

</PRE></OL>When you try to use the table without a code page in the
Catalog Manager a dialog appears, allowing you to specify
the platform on which the file was created. Once a table
is tagged with a code page you do not have to tag it again.
If you do not specify a code page, the table is displayed
with the code page of the current platform. To remove a
tag from a table, run CPZERO.PRG, located in the
FoxPro root directory.

</PRE>17  Why does INSTALL /N Prompt for a Floppy Disk?
18  When I type INSTALL /N at an MS-DOS prompt within Windows
<PRE>    I receive a memory error. What can I do?
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
Why does the FoxPro installation sometimes stop before
allowing the installation of optional components?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
Sometimes in low memory conditions the installation program
is unable to determine whether to run the Standard
(FOXPRO.EXE) or the 32-bit Extended (FOXPROX.EXE) version
to complete the installation. If you're installing from
within Windows, you can exit Windows to make more memory
available. If you have any TSR programs residing in memory,
removing them from memory may free additional memory. For
information on installing optional components after you have
installed FoxPro, see Question 2 in this section.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
How do I install additional files that I didn't specify
during installation?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
Restart FoxPro by typing FOX at the MS-DOS prompt and
pressing Enter. Insert any one of the product disks into
drive A and enter the following command in the FoxPro
Command window:
<P>
DO INSTALL
<P>
You are prompted to insert the disk or disks that
contain the additional files you want to install. If you
are attempting to install from a drive other than drive A,
you are instructed to select another source drive
after the "Abort, Retry, Fail?" message.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
Why does FoxPro reboot during the installation process?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
You could have an anti-virus program running, a memory
conflict, or an old video driver. Disable any anti-virus
program or old video driver and retry the installation
of optional components as described in Question 2, above.
Make sure you are excluding areas of memory required to
load video drivers or network cards. For example, if you
are loading EMM386 in your CONFIG.SYS file, the
"X=D800-DFFF" parameter in the following device driver
load command in MS-DOS will reserve those memory segments:
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE RAM 2048 X=D800-DFFF

</PRE>If you are using an older version of your video card
driver, contact the manufacturer or use the Microsoft
Download Service (MSDL) to get new drivers. MSDL is
described in the Product Support section, below.
<P>
If you are installing from within Windows, try using a
different video driver (for example, the generic VGA
driver, VGA.DRV) and run with no old video drivers
loaded in the AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS files.
 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
What MS-DOS BUFFERS and FILES statements are appropriate for
FoxPro for MS-DOS?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
For best performance with FoxPro when the SMARTDRV device
driver is loaded, set BUFFERS to 10 in the CONFIG.SYS file.
Anything more is redundant, taking up valuable memory that
FoxPro could use for processing.
<P>
If you don't use a disk cache program such as SMARTDRV,
you should allocate enough MS-DOS buffers to hold all of
the directory entries in the subdirectory where you will
be working. Setting BUFFERS to 40 is usually sufficient
as long as the number of files in a subdirectory remains
below 250.
<P>
The FILES statement should always be at least 10 more than
the greatest number of files that you will have open at
one time. We recommend that you set FILES to 40 or greater.
 
<P>
Question 5
<P>
Can I run the FoxPro 32-bit Extended version in Enhanced
Mode Windows or with EMM386 with the NOEMS option?
<P>
Answer 5
<P>
Yes. FoxPro works with DPMI-compliant memory managers,
such as Microsoft Windows and EMM386. If you use a DPMI
memory manager, you can control the physical memory that
FoxPro uses by specifying the MEMLIMIT option in your
CONFIG.FP file. For more information on the MEMLIMIT option,
refer to the Update manual and to "Changes to Documentation
Since Printing" in Help.
 
<P>
Question 6
<P>
What factors influence FoxPro startup speed?
<P>
Answer 6
<P>
The time required to load and start FoxPro relates to the
physical size of FoxPro, the length of the path in effect,
the number of items FoxPro has to locate at startup, and
other factors. You can control many of these items.
For a complete discussion of this issue, refer to
"Optimizing Your System" in the Installation and
Configuration manual.
 
<P>
Question 7
<P>
I'm receiving the error message "Too many files open."
How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 7
<P>
If you receive this error message, use one or more of the
following strategies:
<P>
* Increase the FILES setting in the CONFIG.SYS file.
* If you are using a Novell network, increase the FILE
<PRE>  HANDLES setting in the SHELL.CFG file.
</PRE>* If you are using the MS-DOS SHARE program, increase the
<PRE>  number of files and locks. For example, you could use
  SHARE /F: 4096 /L:500 in the CONFIG.SYS file.
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 8
<P>
The Standard version of FoxPro for MS-DOS runs
correctly on my computer, but when I load the 32-bit
Extended version I receive the error message "Incompatible
memory manager."  What's causing this problem?
<P>
Answer 8
<P>
When you configure your memory manager, verify that it
can use extended memory, and that the proper switches
are set. For further information on the 32-bit Extended
version of FoxPro, refer to "Optimizing Your System" in
the Installation and Configuration Guide.
 
<P>
Question 9
<P>
I'm receiving the error message "RUN/! command failed." How
can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 9
<P>
Make sure your CONFIG.SYS file contains this line:
<P>
<PRE>  SHELL = C:\&lt;path&gt;\COMMAND.COM C:\&lt;path&gt;\ /P /E:1024

</PRE>Also, make sure that the correct version of COMMAND.COM
resides in the specified directory.
<P>
If the SHELL line shown here is already in your CONFIG.SYS
file, then you've received this error because FoxPro doesn't
have enough conventional memory to execute the RUN command.
If this is the case, use RUN /0 DIR instead of RUN DIR.
RUN /0 automatically loads FoxSwap, which makes all
available conventional memory accessible to FoxPro.
For more information on the RUN command and FoxSwap, refer
to "RUN|! Commands" in Help.
 
<P>
Question 10
<P>
Why do I have several files with the extension .TMP on my
disk?
<P>
Answer 10
<P>
Every time you load FoxPro, it creates temporary (.TMP)
files. These files are automatically deleted when you exit
FoxPro with a normal shutdown. However, .TMP files still
exist if you reboot the machine from within FoxPro, or if
you don't have delete rights in the directory where the
files reside. Exit FoxPro and acquire the rights to delete
all these files. One caution: Other programs, such as
Windows, also create .TMP files. To be safe, make sure no
other applications are active when you delete .TMP files.
 
<P>
Question 11
<P>
When I try to start up a second instance of FoxPro for
MS-DOS within Windows, I get the error "Cannot access file
at this time." This only happens when the version of
FoxPro resides on my local drive.
<P>
Answer 11
<P>
The MS-DOS SHARE program is the most common cause of this
problem. Current workarounds include marking the FoxPro
FOXPRO.EXE and FOXPROX.EXE files read only, running under
Windows for Workgroups, or running a copy of FoxPro from
a network location.
 
<P>
Question 12
<P>
I get Cannot Create &lt;Path&gt;\FOXPRO.EXE" Error
During Installation. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 12
<P>
One possible cause is that FOXPRO.EXE or FOXPROX.EXE already
exists in that directory and it is marked read-only.
<P>
For the Setup program to be able to perform a successful
install, the .EXE file must be either renamed or marked as
read/write. The command ATTRIB -R &lt;path&gt;\FOXPRO.EXE will
remove the Read-Only attribute from the file.
 
<P>
Question 13
<P>
What are the minimum files required to run FoxPro?
<P>
Answer 13
<P>
Not all files placed on the hard disk during installation
of FoxPro are absolutely required for operation of the
product. FoxPro for MS-DOS can be started with only two
files: FOXPRO.EXE and FOXPRO.OVL. For the extended (32 bit)
version, these two files can be replaced by only one,
FOXPROX.EXE.
<P>
The minimum files needed to run FoxPro, use the menu and
screen generators, and set printer drivers are listed below.
<P>
NOTE: Upon startup, FoxPro will create FOXUSER.DBF and
FOXUSER.FPT files, and upon screen or menu generation, it
will create the appropriate .FXP files.

<P>
Question 14
<P>
A "CRC Error" Occurs During Setup.
How can I correct this error?
<P>
Answer 14
<P>
When reading a disk, MS-DOS performs a cyclical redundancy
check (CRC) to verify disk sectors. The CRC is a
sophisticated parity check of the data in each sector and
will detect most data errors, such as lost or scrambled
bits.
<P>
To determine if there is a problem with the disks:

<OL><P><LI>Attempt the installation a second time.

<P><LI>Install on a "clean" (minimal) configuration.

<P><LI>Install on another machine to verify there is not a
   hardware problem.

<P><LI>Copy the floppy disks to a temporary directory on the
   hard disk and run the Setup program from this temporary
   directory.
<P>
</OL>If the installation still fails, call Microsoft Technical
Support for assistance.
 
<P>
Question 15
<P>
The following error occurs File 'ADDUSER.APP' Does Not
Exist" Running INSTALL /N. How can I correct this?
<P>
Answer 15
<P>
The INSTALL /N command was not issued from the directory
containing the Administrative Installation (INSTALL /A) of
FoxPro.
<P>
After a Workstation Installation completes the Basic
portion of its installation, it calls the FoxPro program
ADDUSER.APP to configure the workstation for the network
environment. In order for FoxPro to load and run
ADDDUSER.APP, the current directory must be the
Administrative Installation directory.
<P>
Even if the Administrative Installation directory is on
the MS-DOS search path, allowing FoxPro itself to start,
because ADDUSER.APP is not an MS-DOS executable program
(.COM or .EXE), it cannot be located on the path, thus
causing the error message.
<P>
RESOLUTION
<P>
Go to the drive and directory containing the Administrative
Installation of FoxPro, and type "INSTALL /N" (without the
quotation marks).
 
<P>
Question 16
<P>
The Configuration Portion of INSTALL /N Fails.
How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 16
<P>
The command, "INSTALL /N" (without the quotation marks) was
not issued from the directory containing the Administrative
Installation (INSTALL /A) of FoxPro.
<P>
Go to the drive and directory containing the Administrative
Installation of FoxPro, then reissue the INSTALL /N command.
<P>
After a Workstation Installation completes the Basic portion
of its installation, it calls the FoxPro program ADDUSER.APP
to configure the workstation for the network environment. In
order for FoxPro to load and run ADDDUSER.APP, the current
directory must be the Administrative Installation directory.
<P>
The error received depends on which directory you started
INSTALL /N from, and whether you are running it from an
MS-DOS prompt in Windows, or at MS-DOS itself.
 
<P>
Question 17
<P>
Why does INSTALL /N Prompt for a Floppy Disk?
<P>
Answer 17
<P>
The INSTALL /N command was not issued from the Administrative
Installation directory.
<P>
To avoid this problem, use one of the following workarounds.
<P>
Workaround 1: Go to the Administrative Installation
Directory
<P>
Go to the Administrative Installation directory, and then
type the command "INSTALL /N" (without the quotation marks).
<P>
For example, assuming the Administrative Installation is
located in a directory named N:\ADMIN, type the following
commands at the MS-DOS prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   N:
   CD\ADMIN
   INSTALL /N

</PRE></OL>Workaround 2: Use SUBST to Reassign the Local Drive to
Another Letter
<P>
If, for reasons such as testing, you require that the
Administrative Installation be located on a local hard disk
and you do not want to issue the INSTALL /N command from the
Administrative Installation directory, use the MS-DOS SUBST
command to reassign the directory containing the
Administrative Installation to another drive letter.
<P>
For example, assuming the Administrative Installation is
located in a directory named C:\ADMIN and you want to create
a Workstation Installation in a directory named C:\WORKSTA,
type the following at the MS-DOS prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   SUBST N: C:\ADMIN
   C:
   CD\WORKSTA
   N:\INSTALL /N

</PRE>The Workstation Installation requires a previous
Administrative Installation. Even though it prompts for a
floppy disk, the Workstation Installation cannot be
performed using the Installation floppy disks.
 
Question 18
<P>
When I type INSTALL /N at an MS-DOS prompt within Windows
I receive a memory error. What can I do?
<P>
Answer 18
<P>
In some instances, an Administrative Installation will not
work from an MS-DOS prompt within Windows. To run a
Network installation from an Administrative Installation
directory, you might need to exit Windows and use the main
MS-DOS prompt.

Part 12: Note about the OBJVAR() Function
 
<P>
In its current implementation, OBJVAR() may not return
correct values under the following circumstances:
<P>
*   When used in conjunction with a Radio or Push button set,
<PRE>    OBJVAR() will return only the variable name for the
    object number that corresponds to the first button in the
    set. OBJVAR() won't return correct values for objects
    subsequent to the button set.

</PRE>*   OBJVAR() appends "m." before memory variable names,
<PRE>    including arrays. When you use OBJVAR() to determine the
    name of an array, you must first remove the appended "m."
    before attempting to reference an array member.
