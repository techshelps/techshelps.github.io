The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a large memo field is included in a report where the detail band is
wide (long from top to bottom), the Visual FoxPro Report Designer prints
that memo field, then forces the remainder of the detail band to the next
page, even though there is adequate space to print more detail on the
current page.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the report can be so designed, keep the detail band narrower, from top
to bottom, than approximately four inches. This measurement in not exact as
different reports work correctly at different band sizes. There are reports
of bands six inches deep printing correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a table using the following commands:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CREATE TABLE Test (first c(5),  firstmemo m, second c(5))
      INSERT INTO Test (first, firstmemo, second) ;
<PRE></PRE>         VALUES ('abcde', REPLICATE("This is a wordy expression. ",30), ;
         'zyxwv')

</PRE><P><LI>Leave that table open in a workarea.

<P><LI>Create a quick report based on the table you just created. To do this,
   click New on the File menu and then select Report from the list of
   options. Click the large New File command button at the top-right of the
   New dialog box.

<P><LI>When the "Microsoft Visual FoxPro Report Designer" appears, click the
   Report pad on the menu bar, then the Quick Report item from the pop-up
   menu.

<P><LI>When the Quick Report dialog box appears, there are two large command
   buttons in the area labeled "Field Layout." The right-hand button
   illustrates vertical field alignment. Click it. Then click OK.

<P><LI>The three fields of the table now appear in the "Detail" band of the
   report being designed.
<P>
   The format of the report is as follows:
<P>
   A. The fields and labels are arranged vertically,
<P><PRE>      the label for each field is to the left of the field.
</PRE><P>
   Below the detail band is the bar labeled "Detail." Move the cursor to
   that bar. The cursor changes to a double-headed arrow. Click and
   drag the bar down until the ruler at the left shows the detail band to
   be eight inches in depth. This requires repeatedly scrolling down in
   order to see drag-space at the bottom of the Report Designer's window.
   An alternative to clicking and dragging the "Detail" band is to
   double-click the Detail band to open up the Detail dialog box and
   change the Height to 8 inches using the Spinner control.
<P>
   B. All the fields and labels float, all the fields can stretch.
<P>
   Those properties are set by default. To verify this one-by-one, position
   the cursor over each field and label. Right-click to bring up the
   context menu for that item. On the context menu click Properties.
   The Report Expression dialog box appears. It shows the name of
   the field or label, and that item's Field position. Be sure Float is
   the selected option. The fields also show a check box labeled
   "Stretch with overflow." Be sure that is checked. Labels do not have the
   "Stretch . . ." check box.
<P>
   C. The memo field is narrow.
<P>
   Click the memo field's text box to make it the "selected" control. It
   now has handles (small black squares.) Click the center handle on
   the right edge of the memo field, and drag that edge to the right to
   open the memo field to nearly the full width of the page.

<P><LI>Preview the report. (On the View menu, click Preview.)
<P>
</OL>You will see the following behavior:

<UL><LI>The label for the First field, and the field show where they would be
   expected.

<LI>The label for the Firstmemo field and the field show where they would be
   expected.

<LI>The label for the "Second" field is immediately beneath the label for
   the "Firstmemo field.

<LI>The rest of the page is blank.

<LI>The field contents for the Second field is pushed to the next page.
