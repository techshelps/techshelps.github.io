<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
While the FoxPro interface offers a number of dialog boxes presenting a
list of fields from which sets can be chosen, the Browse menu options do
not permit fields to be specified. However, it is possible to construct a
Browse statement in the Command window that contains a list of fields
picked through the user interface, without resorting to programming.
<P>
NOTE: The following workaround is not available from Catalog Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Browse option is available from either of the following menu locations:

<UL><LI>On the Database menu, click Browse.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>On the Window menu click Work Area View and then Browse.
<P>
</UL>When you use either of these options, the BROWSE LAST command is issued to
the system, as you can see by examining the Command window. Provided the
resource file is enabled, the BROWSE LAST command displays the fields and
layout in which the BROWSE for the currently selected table was last
viewed.
<P>
To specify which fields are to be viewed in a Browse, you must issue the
BROWSE command from the Command window. Unfortunately, interactively
specifying more than a dozen or so fields in the Command window is a
tedious and time-consuming process. Also, you must re-enter the entire
command if:

<UL><LI>The completed command is not saved in a program file before you exit
   from FoxPro.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You need to display different fields.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The resource file is not enabled.
<P>
</UL>Because of this, you may want to use the following steps during interactive
sessions:
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Create the Browse Field List Interactively</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Ensure that both the Command window and the database are open.

<P><LI>On the Database menu, click Append From.

<P><LI>In the From field, enter a non-existing filename (such as 'ZZZ').

<P><LI>Click the Fields button, and choose the fields you want.

<P><LI>Leave the File Type selected at the default: Table (DBF).

<P><LI>Optionally, select any desired Criteria, such as For.

<P><LI>Once all clauses have been specified, choose Append.

<P><LI>Press any key when you see the error "File 'zzz.dbf' does not exist."
   This is a harmless error that you can ignore.

<P><LI>In the Command window, select APPEND FROM ZZZ, type BROWSE, and then
   Return.
<P>
</OL>Once the Browse has executed, the displayed fields can be modified by
scrolling up to the command in the Command window and locating the desired
fields in the FIELDS list.
