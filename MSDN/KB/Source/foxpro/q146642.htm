<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0 and 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro's Project Manager has a Remove button that once pressed asks:
<P>
<PRE>   Do you want to remove the file from the project or delete it
   from the disk?

</PRE>If you tell Visual FoxPro to delete the file, the file is marked for
deletion in the standard MS-DOS fashion under Windows 3.11 or Windows 95,
thus removing the first charter of the file's name and allowing new files
to use that disk space.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 6.22, you can use the Undelete.exe
program that came with MS-DOS to undelete the file. Earlier versions of
MS-DOS that have an UNDELETE command may also enable you to retrieve your
deleted file. See your MS-DOS documentation for more details. Other
Utilities that provide undelete utilities may also work to restore your
deleted files, see the documentation for your installed software. Do not
install any new software, save any files, or do any type of action that
will write information to your hard disk. This will maximize your chances
of retrieving your deleted files.
<P>
If you are using Windows 95, and delete a file that you did not intend to
delete from your hard disk, create an MS-DOS 6.22 boot disk, and copy
Undelete.exe to that floppy disk. You will need to find a computer with
MS-DOS 6.22 as the operating system so that you can create a boot disk
using FORMAT A: /S, and copy the Undelete.exe to that disk. Once you have
the floppy disk, insert in drive A:, and boot your computer using the boot
disk. Press ENTER for the date, and press ENTER for the time.
<P>
For example, to use the Undelete.exe of MS-DOS 6.22, type the following at
the A: prompt:
<P>
A:&gt;undelete c:\vfp\*.*
<P>
You will have to provide the first letter of each file you wish to
undelete. Remember that many files consist of more that one file, for
example a form consists of an .scx and a .sct file. See File Extensions and
File Types in Visual FoxPro's Help file for a listing of the extensions
that Visual FoxPro uses.
