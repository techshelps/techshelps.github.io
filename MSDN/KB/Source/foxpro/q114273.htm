The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information below describes FoxPro's dBASE compatibility. This
information is also found in FoxPro version 2.6 Help.
<P>
To locate this help file topic, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>If you are using the Windows-style help file (FOXHELP.HLP), choose dBASE
   Help from the Help menu. Then, choose the dBASE Compatibility topic.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If you are using the .DBF-style help file (FOXHELP.DBF), choose the
   Compatibility topic, located under General Topics. Scroll approximately
   halfway down the topic until you find the "dBASE Compatibility" heading.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

<PRE>                            DBASE COMPATIBILITY
                            ===================

</PRE>Both dBASE III and dBASE IV files can be used in FoxPro.
<P>
<P><h3>Sharing Files Between dBASE and FoxPro</h3>
 
<P>
Although you can share files between dBASE and FoxPro, it is not
recommended. FoxPro and dBASE have incompatible file locking mechanisms. In
addition, because of the necessity of recreating index and memo field files
for each application, tables are difficult to maintain.
<P>
<P><h3>dBASE III</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro is a superset of dBASE III. Your dBASE III programs can run
unchanged in FoxPro. See the discussion on FoxBASE+ compatibility for
details.
<P>
<P><h3>dBASE IV</h3>
 
<P>
The only significant areas of incompatibility with dBASE IV are security,
network functions, and the more rarely used SQL and transaction processing
functions. Most SQL programs (.PRS files) will need to be rewritten in
FoxPro. Also, FoxPro doesn't offer native support for security or
transaction processing. Many software vendors offer extensive libraries of
security and network functions, providing an even richer alternative to the
set of functions supported in dBASE.
<P>
<P><h3>Enhancing Compatibility with dBASE IV</h3>
 
<P>
You can maximize compatibility by issuing the command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET COMPATIBLE DB4

</PRE>This command changes the way FoxPro executes certain commands and functions
to match the behavior of dBASE. Setting COMPATIBLE DB4 is a great way to
get your application up and running. Eventually, as you add FoxPro
features, you might find it easier to move away from using the
compatibility feature.
<P>
When you are operating in the Catalog Manager, SET COMPATIBLE DB4 is the
default.
<P>
<P><h3>Template Programming</h3>
 
<P>
The dBASE IV template language is different from and independent of dBASE,
so dBASE template programs cannot be used in FoxPro and will have to be
rewritten. However, you don't have to learn another template language.
FoxPro supports template programming natively. FoxPro commands that can be
used in template programming include:
<P>
<PRE>    \ | \\
    SET TEXTMERGE DELIMITERS
    SET TEXTMERGE
    _TEXT
    _PRETEXT
    TEXT ... ENDTEXT

</PRE>For more information on template programming in FoxPro, see Chapter 11,
"Text Merge," in the FoxPro "Developer's Guide."
<P>
<P><h3>Other Issues in dBASE IV Compatibility</h3>
 
<P>
In addition to the few language and syntax differences, the following
differences between FoxPro and dBASE should be noted.
<P>
Parameter Passing:
<P>
In dBASE IV, parameters are passed by reference to both procedures and
functions. In FoxPro, parameters are passed by reference to procedures and
by value to functions.
<P>
To pass parameters by reference to functions, add the command SET UDFPARMS
TO REFERENCE to your program.
<P>
Changing Work Areas in a UDF:
<P>
In FoxPro, if you change the selected work area in a UDF, the newly
selected work area remains selected when the UDF returns control to the
calling program. Upon return from a UDF, dBASE IV reselects the work area
that had been selected before the function was called.
<P>
SET MULTILOCKS:
<P>
SET MULTILOCKS ON is implicit in dBASE IV. You must explicitly set
multilocks on in FoxPro.
<P>
Reading Keystrokes:
<P>
dBASE IV and FoxPro use different keyboard shortcut keys in the interactive
environment. If a dBASE IV application uses the READKEY or LASTKEY
functions to check the user's last action and respond appropriately, errors
might result.
<P>
FoxPro reads the key assignments from a macro file with the extension .FKY.
Modify the FOXPLUS.FKY macro file included with FoxPro versuib 2.6 so
keystrokes are mapped to dBASE keystrokes. Then issue the command RESTORE
MACROS FROM FOXPLUS.FKY from your program.
<P>
Hard-Coded File Extensions:
<P>
If you have hard-coded file extensions in your dBASE programs, you'll need
to change some of the extensions. The following table shows FoxPro
equivalent extensions for each type of dBASE file that a program might use.
This table assumes that AutoConvert has converted all associated dBASE
files.
