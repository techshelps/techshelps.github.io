<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.5
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When the command ON SHUTDOWN QUIT is issued and FoxPro for Windows is
exited by double-clicking the Control-menu box, available memory and
system resources are consumed and not released in Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FoxPro 2.5 for
Windows. This problem was corrected in FoxPro 2.5a for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Windows Program Manager, choose About Program Manager from the
   Help menu and note the amount of memory available in Windows.

<P><LI>Create a command program with the following lines of code and
   execute it:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ON SHUTDOWN QUIT
<PRE></PRE>      @ 5,5 GET Tmp1 DEFAULT "     "
      @ 6,5 GET Tmp2 DEFAULT "     "
      READ CYCLE

</PRE><P><LI>Double-click the Control-menu box to quit FoxPro. (The Control-menu
   box is the spacebar in the upper-left corner of the FoxPro window.)

<P><LI>Note the available memory again.
<P>
</OL>Each time these steps are performed, 150K or 149K is lost, and the
memory is not released at any known point.
<P>
After running the program seven times and quitting as outlined above
on a Gateway 486DX2/50, about 2 MB of memory was lost. After ten
iterations of the steps outlined above on a Dell 486P/50, about 1344K
was lost. These two computers had different memory managers: HIMEM.SYS
from Windows 3.1 and 386MAX.
<P>
On both systems, Windows system resources degraded also; 5 to 8
percent of the resources was lost.
