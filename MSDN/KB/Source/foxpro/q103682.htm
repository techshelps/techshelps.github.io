The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5 and 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The ampersand (&amp;) character will not display in some controls and
instead will show the next character as being underlined. For example,
the following procedure works differently in FoxPro for Windows and
FoxPro for MS-DOS:

<OL><P><LI>In a new screen, add a popup object. In the Popup Prompts box, type
   the following three prompts:
<P>
<P><PRE>      This &amp; That
      Tom &amp; Jerry
      Curly &amp; Moe
</PRE>
<P><LI>As soon as you assign a variable name and choose OK, you will see
   the popup prompt displayed as
<P>
<P><PRE>      This _That
</PRE><P>
</OL>If you select "This _That" so that it drops down, you will then see
"This &amp; That" as well as the other correctly displayed prompts.
However, as soon as you select a prompt, its display will return to
being an underscore and no space instead of the &amp;.
<P>
The same result occurs in FoxPro versions 2.5 and 2.5a for Windows. This
behavior does not affect any version of FoxPro for MS-DOS.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because of a limitation of the Windows
environment. Similar behavior will be exhibited in other Windows-based
applications such as Visual Basic. This behavior is by design, and
changing this behavior would make FoxPro for Windows behave in a
manner inconsistent with other Windows-based applications.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To display an ampersand character in Windows, use a double ampersand
(&amp;&amp;). In some cases, you can use the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>In the Screen Setup Code snippet, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      m.myvar = "This &amp;"+"&amp; That"
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the Popup Prompts box for the list box control, type "&amp;myvar"
   (without the quotation marks) instead of "This &amp; That".
<P>
   NOTE: You cannot directly type
<P>
<P><PRE>      m.myvar = "This &amp;&amp; That"
</PRE><P>
   because FoxPro will assume that everything after the double
   ampersand is a comment and return an error.
<P></OL>
