The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how you can manually register an OLE server on a
computer that has never had Visual FoxPro 5.0 installed.
<P>
This article also assumes you already know how to create a custom OLE
server. You can read Chapter 16 of the Visual FoxPro Developer's Guide,
"Registering a Custom OLE Server," for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In order to register an .exe or a .dll custom OLE server, you need to have
the following two files located in the \System directory for Windows 95 or
the \System32 directory for Windows NT on the machine you are installing
to.
<P>
<PRE>   VFP500.DLL
   VFP5ENU.DLL

</PRE>If you do not have these files, you can obtain them from the machine on
which you have Visual FoxPro 5.0 installed.
<P>
When you build a custom OLE server, the following three files are created:

<UL><LI>The .dll or .exe file
<LI>A type library .tlb file (The .TLB file is optional and is not required
   to be distributed)
<LI>A registry .vbr file
<P>
</UL>Here is an example that shows you how to register an .exe file:
<P>
When trying to register an .exe file, you must have the .exe and the .vbr
files. The example below assumes you already have a custom OLE server built
and named Oleserver.exe:

<UL><LI>Oleserver.exe (This is the custom OLE server .exe file that you built
<PRE>                 from your project.)
</PRE><LI>Oleserver.vbr (This file gets automatically created when you build your
<PRE>                 custom OLE server.)

</PRE></UL>Once you copy these two files into the target machine, from the directory
that contains these two files, type the command below at the MS-DOS prompt.
<P>
<PRE>   OLEServer /regserver

</PRE>Your .exe file should now be registered.
<P>
Here is an example that shows you how to register a .dll file:
<P>
When trying to register a .dll file you must have the .dll and .vbr files
and have access to a third file, Regsvr32.exe. The example below assumes
you already have a custom OLE server built and named Oleserver.dll:

<UL><LI>OLEServer.DLL (This is the custom OLE server .dll file you built from
<PRE>                 your project.)
</PRE><LI>OLEServer.VBR (This file gets automatically created when you build your
<PRE>                 project.)
</PRE><LI>Regsvr32.exe  (This file comes with Visual FoxPro 5.0 and a number of
<PRE>                 other Microsoft applications.)

</PRE></UL>Once you copy these two files (.dll and .vbr) into the target machine, from
the directory that contains these two files, type the command below at the
MS-DOS prompt
<P>
<PRE>   REGSVR32 OLEServer.DLL

</PRE>You should get a message box that says "DllRegisterServer in OLEServer.dll
succeeded." Your .dll file is now registered.
<P>
If you do not have Regsvr32.exe in you target machine, you can obtain this
file from Visual FoxPro 5.0 directory
<P>
NOTE: Manually registering these files is necessary only if you are not
using the Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard to install your custom OLE server.
