The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information below describes the Multi-Column Report Wizard and how
to use it to create a report with up to three columns.
<P>
This information is also found in FoxPro online Help in the "Multi-Column
Report Wizard" topic.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Multi-Column Report Wizard uses a table you specify to set up a report
with one, two, or three columns of data per page. You can choose the report
style and layout.
<P>
NOTE: This wizard is available only if you are using Microsoft FoxPro for
Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>MULTI-COLUMN REPORT WIZARD STEPS</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1 of 7: Selecting a table</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: This step is skipped if you start the wizard from the Catalog
Manager, and a table is already in use.
<P>
First select the table you want to use for your report. The list contains
the tables that were open when you started the wizard. If you want to use a
table that is not currently open, choose the Open... button.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2 of 7: Selecting a Style for the Report</h3>
 
<P>
Select one of the available styles for your report. The graphic on the
wizard screen changes to show you what the report will look like.
<P>
Step 3 of 7: Setting the Number of Columns
 
<P>
Under Number of columns for each page, select the 1 column, 2 columns, or 3
columns option to control how many columns are printed on each page of your
report.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 4 of 7: Selecting the Fields to Include in the Report</h3>
 
<P>
Select the fields you want to include in your report. The list of Available
Fields shows all the fields in the table you selected.
<P>
To select fields you can:

<UL><LI>Double-click each field name in the Available Fields list.

<LI>Select each field name and choose the Add button.

<LI>Choose the Add All button to use all the table fields.
<P>
</UL>If you add a field you don't need, select it and choose the Remove button.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 5 of 7: Selecting a Layout for the Report</h3>
 
<P>
Select Horizontal if you want the field names to appear as titles above the
columns on the page; select Vertical if you want the field names to run
down the left side of each column in the report.
<P>
If you need to further adjust the layout of the report, choose the Print
Setup... button. This displays the Print Setup dialog, where you can select
a printer, set paper size and orientation, and set printer options.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 6 of 7: Setting the Sort Order for the Report</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: This step will be skipped if you are basing your report on a query.
<P>
Select up to three fields from the Available Fields by which to sort the
records in your report. The selected fields are combined to create an index
tag.
<P>
For example, if you choose State and then City, the records in the finished
report will be sorted by state, and then by city within each state.
<P>
Choose the Ascending option to sort records from the beginning of the
alphabet, the lowest number, or the earliest date; choose the Descending
option to sort records from the end of the alphabet, the highest number, or
the latest date.
<P>
Step 7 of 7: Naming, Previewing, Saving, Modifying, and Printing the
<PRE>             Report
</PRE> 
<P>
First, enter the title you want to appear at the top of your new report.
Then, choose the Preview... button to see your report in a preview window.
If you are satisfied with the results, select one of the following options,
and then choose the Finish button.

<UL><LI>Save Report for Later Use creates a Microsoft FoxPro report (.FRX)
   file you can later use to run your report.

<LI>Save and Print Report displays the Save As dialog so you can save
   the report, then displays the Print dialog so you can select print
   options and send it to a printer.

<LI>Modify Report with Design Tool saves the report and displays it in
   the Report Layout window, so you can modify it as needed.
