The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5 and 2.5a
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, and 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The relationship between two tables (for example, tables named Parent
and Child) appears to be correct when you are browsing the two tables
simultaneously, but in a single Browse window that contains fields
from both tables, the relationship is revealed to be incorrect.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
For the relationship to work correctly in all cases, you must create
an index in Child that is the same length as the related field in
Parent. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT 2
   INDEX ON PADR(num,4) TAG OKNUM
   SET ORDER TO OKNUM
   SELECT 1
   SET RELA TO parent.num INTO child

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create two tables: "Parent", which has a character field named
   "Num" with a width of 4, and "Child", which has a character field
   named "Num" with a width of 2.

<P><LI>In Parent, add two records "0   " (zero followed by three spaces)
<PRE>   and "1   " ("1" followed by three spaces).

</PRE><P><LI>In Child, add two records "0 " (zero followed by one space) and "1
   " ("1" followed by one space).

<P><LI>In the Command window, type the following commands:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CLOSE DATABASES
      USE parent IN 1
      USE child IN 2
      SELECT 1
      INDEX ON num TAG num
      SELECT 2
      INDEX ON num TAG num
      SELECT 1
      SET RELATION TO parent.num INTO child
</PRE>
<P><LI>Open two Browse windows, one for Parent and one for Child. Note
   that when the record pointer in Parent is on either of the two
   records in Parent, only the related record appears in the Browse
   window for Child.

<P><LI>Close the two Browse windows, and type the following commands in
   the Command window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SELECT 1
      BROWSE FIELDS parent.num, child.num
</PRE><P>
</OL>Note that only the value for the Parent field appears. This behavior
will also occur if a report is built using the relationship between
Parent and Child.
