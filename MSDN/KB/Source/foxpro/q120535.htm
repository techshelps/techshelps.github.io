<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6, 2.6a

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The FoxPro "User's Guide" or "Interface Guide" under the paragraph
heading "Inverting Selected Objects" states the following:
<P>
You can invert selected objects with the selection marquee. When you
invert objects, selected objects become deselected and deselected
objects become selected.

<OL><P><LI>Press the Shift key, then drag the mouse to draw the marquee around
   the objects.

<P><LI>Release the mouse button. Objects that were selected are now
   deselected and objects that were deselected are now selected.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This paragraph is not specific enough. The first sentence is very important
in that it implies that some objects have already been selected before the
rest of the steps are performed.
<P>
Here is a more precise set of steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select a set of objects by dragging the mouse to draw the marquee
   around them. These objects will become selected momentarily but it is
   ultimately desired that these object are to be part of the group of
   objects not selected.

<P><LI>Press the Shift key. Then drag the mouse to draw the marquee around
   the objects.

<P><LI>Release the mouse button. Objects that were selected are now
   deselected and objects that were deselected are now selected.
<P>
