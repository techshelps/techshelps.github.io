The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When running a form created using the Form Wizard, the following warning
may be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Edits to one or more of the views may not be permanent. To remedy this,
   ensure the View's Send SQL Updates checkbox is checked in the View
   Designer.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The form was created from one or more views that have not been made
updateable.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In order to avoid this warning, you may implement one of the following
workarounds. It is important to recognize that neither of these two
workarounds allows changes to be made to the data; they merely provide a
method of avoiding the warning message.

<OL><P><LI>Make at least one field in the view updateable, and check the "Send SQL
   Updates" checkbox.

<P><LI>Modify the txtbtns class (included in Wizstyle.vcx) so that it will not
   display the warning. Open the txtbtns class in the visual class
   designer, and comment out the following lines of code in the Initvars
   method:
<P>
   IF !CURSORGETPROP("SendUpdates",.Alias) AND !m.lShowedMess
<P><PRE>      =MESSAGEBOX(C_NOUPDATEVIEW_LOC)
      lShowedMess = .T.
</PRE>   ENDIF
<P>
</OL>Note: Modifying this class will affect every form that is created with the
Form Wizard.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Form Wizard was designed to create data-entry forms. It is assumed that
you will want to make changes to the data that the form is based on.
Therefore, as the form is loading, it checks to see if any views that are
part of its data environment are non-updateable (read-only). If non-
updateable views are found, the above warning is displayed.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a local or remote view in the View Designer. Make certain that
   the "Send SQL Updates" checkbox is not checked.

<P><LI>Run the Form Wizard, and create a form based on the view that was just
   created.

<P><LI>Run the newly created form. Note that the warning message is displayed.
<P></OL>
