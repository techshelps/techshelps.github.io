<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The International Distribution Kit Bundle is sold to customers outside of
North America who are using localized versions of FoxPro. This article
describes the International Distribution Kit Bundle.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a localized version of FoxPro is produced for a particular country, a
localized version of the Distribution Kit may or may not be produced
specifically for that product. Localized versions of the Distribution Kit
have been produced for the French and German languages, but have not been
produced for many other languages. The International Distribution Kit
Bundle was developed for many of these other languages.
<P>
The International Distribution Kit Bundle for FoxPro version 2.5b for MS-
DOS works in conjunction with versions of FoxPro that were localized for
these languages:
<P>
<PRE>   Spanish
   Portuguese
   Czech

</PRE>The International Distribution Kit Bundle for FoxPro version 2.5b for
Windows works in conjunction with versions of FoxPro that were localized
for these languages:
<P>
<PRE>   Spanish
   Portuguese
   Czech
   Russian
   Polish
   Italian
   Hungarian

</PRE>The International Distribution Kit Bundle allows developers to install the
localized version of the Distribution Kit in any of the above languages
from the same set of disks. The packaging and the printed documentation is
in English. An outside sticker on the packaging describes the languages
contained in the package. Inside the box there is a multilingual insert
describing installation and pointing the users to localized documentation
provided online.
<P>
All localized versions of the Distribution Kit have the same functionality
as the U.S. version of the Distribution Kit. In the localized versions,
words in the interface (such as menus, dialog boxes, error messages) have
been translated to the appropriate languages.
