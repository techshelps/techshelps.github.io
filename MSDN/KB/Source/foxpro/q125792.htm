<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the Graph Wizard (GENGRAPH.APP), which FoxPro uses to create
graphs, uses Microsoft Graph version 3.0b to create its graphs. The Graph
Wizard, however, has the ability to use any version of Microsoft Graph
installed on the system to create graphs. The Graph Wizard determines which
version of Microsoft Graph to use based on the Microsoft Graph setting in
the Windows WIN.INI file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Graph is a Windows graphing application that ships with several
Microsoft products, including Microsoft FoxPro for Windows and Microsoft
Word for Windows. Over time, with each Microsoft product installation,
different versions of Microsoft Graph may be installed on one computer.
<P>
For example, Microsoft FoxPro version 2.6a for Windows installs Microsoft
Graph version 3.0b. Other Microsoft applications, such as Word for Windows,
may install other versions of Graph as well.
<P>
FoxPro's Graph Wizard determines which version of Microsoft Graph to run
based on the Microsoft Graph setting in the Embedding section of the
Windows WIN.INI file. For the FoxPro Graph Wizard to use Microsoft Graph
version 5.0, the WIN.INI setting should read:
<P>
[Embedding]
MSGraph=Microsoft Graph,Microsoft
Graph,C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\MSGRAPH5\GRAPH5.EXE,picture
<P>
To tell Microsoft GRAPH FoxPro to use a different version to display
graphs, change the line that the path and executable point to a
different version of the Microsoft GRAPH utility. For example, for FoxPro
to run Microsoft Graph version 3.0b, the WIN.INI setting should read:
<P>
[Embedding]
MSGraph=Microsoft Graph,Microsoft
Graph,C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\MSGRAPH\GRAPH.EXE,picture
<P>
NOTE: This example works only if both versions of Microsoft Graph are
installed on the computer. You must exit and restart FoxPro before these
changes affect GENGRAPH.APP.
<P>
By default, Microsoft Windows applications install Microsoft Graph version
3.0 into the WINDOWS\MSAPPS\MSGRAPH subdirectory, and the executable is
GRAPH.EXE. Microsoft Graph version 5.0 is installed by default into the
WINDOWS\MSAPPS\MSGRAPH5 subdirectory, and the executable is GRAPH5.EXE.
<P>
NOTE: Neither GRAPH.EXE or GRAPH5.EXE are executable as stand-alone.
Microsoft Graph must always be run from within another application. Also,
the WIN.INI setting has no effect on FoxPro General fields to which a
Microsoft Graph was linked. When a General field is edited, the source
application will always be opened, these settings are stored in the Windows
Registration Database (REG.DAT).
