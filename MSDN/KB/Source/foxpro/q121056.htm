<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Files listed in the Project Manager, unless they are specifically excluded,
are read-only. Reports, labels, indexes, and databases should not be
included in the Project Manager unless they are marked as EXCLUDEd.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you are creating an application, you may need to create lookup tables.
Lookup tables often contain static information, meaning the information
does not change; for example, a listing of state abbreviations. This file
must be read-only in order to keep the user from making modifications to
it.
<P>
Database files can be added to a project (.PJX) file and have one of two
markings, EXCLUDEd or INCLUDEd. INCLUDEd files are listed in the Project
window and do not contain the Phi symbol (ALT+0248, an "O" with a slash
through it). Any files added to the Project window that are INCLUDEd are
considered read-only and cannot be modified by the user. These files do not
need to be distributed with the application because the contents of these
files are placed in the .EXE file. EXCLUDEd files are listed in the Project
window for reference and ease of modification, but must be manually
distributed if they are needed by the application.
<P>
To exclude a file in a project, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Select the file.

<P><LI>From the Project menu, choose Exclude.
<P>
</OL>The Phi symbol will then be displayed to the right of the filename. This
symbol indicates that the file is marked as EXCLUDEd. All files that are to
be modifiable by the user must be marked as EXCLUDEd and distributed with
the application.
<P>
For more information about excluding files from projects, refer to the
chapter on using Project Manager in your "Developer's Guide."
