The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information below describes the Client-Server Query Wizard.
<P>
This information is also found in FoxPro online Help in the "Client-Server
Query Wizard" topic.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Client-Server Query Wizard lets you connect to any ODBC data server and
use a SQL query to retrieve data from it. It creates a query file with a
.CSQ extension. Each time you run the query file, it will initiate a
connection with the server and run the query.
<P>
FoxPro .CSQ queries allow you to use aggregate functions (such as AVG,
COUNT, MAX, MIN, or SUM) in your query where the ODBC source allows that
capability. The resulting query is read-only; you can browse it or
incorporate it into a report, but you cannot update the records.
<P>
NOTE: The Client-Server Query Wizard is available only if you are using the
Professional edition of Microsoft FoxPro version 2.6. Some back-end
database servers do not support all the functionality available through the
wizard, such as outer joins. Be sure to check to see if your ODBC driver
supports the functions you request from the wizard. For information on
troubleshooting connectivity issues, see Connectivity Kit Error Messages.
<P>
Before using the Client-Server Query Wizard, you need to:

<UL><LI>Install the Microsoft FoxPro Connectivity Kit.

<LI>Install ODBC.

<LI>Register data sources or servers with ODBC.
<P>
</UL>For more information, see the FoxPro Connectivity Kit and ODBC
documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Client-Server Query Wizard Steps</h3>
 
<P>
The Client-Server Query Wizard has seven main steps:

<OL><P><LI>Selecting and connecting to a server or data source

<P><LI>Selecting and joining tables

<P><LI>Selecting fields and adding expressions

<P><LI>Setting options to group query results

<P><LI>Setting the sort order of records (optional)

<P><LI>Limiting or filtering the records retrieved (optional)

<P><LI>Viewing, saving, or browsing the query, or creating an AutoReport
   from it
<P>
</OL>Detailed instructions for each step are provided below.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1 of 7: Selecting a Server and Connecting to It</h3>
 
<P>
In this step, you log onto the server or data source you want to connect to
when running your query. Check with your system administrator if you need
help with server names or your user identifier and password.
<P>
NOTE: If you enter a password on this screen, the resulting query will be
password-protected; that is, you will need to supply this password every
time you run the query.
<P>
Data Source:
From the list, select the name of the server or data source you want to
use. The list contains the names of all registered data sources from the
ODBC.INI file.
<P>
User Identifier:
Enter your user identifier or user name.
<P>
Password:
Enter your password, if required, for this server.
<P>
Database:
(This name is optional) If there is more than one database on the server,
enter the name of the database you want to use.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2 of 7: Selecting and Joining Tables</h3>
 
<P>
First select the table or tables you want to use from the Available Tables
list.
<P>
NOTE: If you are using the Query Wizard from the Catalog Manager, the
tables on which you want to base your query must reside in the open
catalog. If there are no tables found in the catalog and you click the
Query Wizard button, you will be prompted to name your query and select a
table on which to base the query. Next, RQBE will start from which you can
create a query. If you are not using the Query Wizard from the Catalog
Manager, you can also choose the Open Table... button to use a table that
is not currently open.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2a of 7: Joining Tables</h3>
 
<P>
When you select more than one table, the wizard displays this screen so you
can join the tables. Select matching fields from the parent table and the
child table, then choose Add.
<P>
For example, if you are setting a join between the Customer table and the
Invoices table, you could set Customer.cno equal to Invoices.cno.
<P>
The Outer Join check box affects which records will be included in the
output of your query. When the box is checked, all the parent table records
are included, even if they do not have a matching record in the child
table. When the box is not checked, your query will only contain records
from the parent table if matches are found in the child table.
<P>
If you want to delete the relationship between two tables, select the
relationship and choose the Remove button.
<P>
When you are done joining tables, choose Next to continue to the next step.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 3 of 7: Selecting Fields and Adding Expressions</h3>
 
<P>
Select the fields you want to include in the query. The list of available
fields includes fields from all the tables you have selected.
<P>
To Select Fields, You Can:

<UL><LI>Double-click each field name in the Available Fields list.

<LI>Select each field name and choose the Add button.

<LI>Choose the Add All button to use all the table fields.
<P>
</UL>If you add a field you don't need, select it and choose the Remove button.
<P>
Adding Expressions to Your Query:
<P>
You can also add expressions to your query. An expression is a combination
of operators, functions, and field names that evaluate to a single value.
For example, you might want your query to include the sum of all prices:
<P>
<PRE>   SUM(cost)

</PRE></OL>When you choose the Expression... button, the wizard displays the
Expression dialog, where you can create the expression to add to your
query.
<P>
To Create an Expression with the Expression Dialog:

<OL><P><LI>Enter a name for your expression in the Name of calculated field box.

<P><LI>Either type the expression directly into the Expression box, or select
   String, Math, or Date expressions and combine them with the Fields
   available.

<P><LI>When you've finished building the expression, choose OK to confirm it.
<P>
</OL>If you need to modify an expression after you have created it, select it in
the Selected Fields list, and choose the Expression... button again.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 4 of 7: Grouping the Query Results</h3>
 
<P>
From the Available Fields list, select up to three fields by which to group
the records in your query results.
<P>
For example, if you choose to group by state and zip code, the records will
be sorted into groups by state, then grouped and sorted by zip code within
each state.
<P>
This type of grouping can be useful in conjunction with any expressions you
incorporate into your query.
<P>
For example, you could include an expression which does a SUM of all sales,
then group the results by State, to find the total sales by state.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 5 of 7: Setting the Sort Order for the Records</h3>
 
<PRE> In this screen, you determine how the records retrieved by the query will
</PRE></OL>be sorted.
<P>
Select up to three fields from the Available Fields list to set the sort
order of the records. You can sort on fields from any of the selected
tables.
<P>
For example, if you choose Customer.Name and Invoice.Ino, the records will
be sorted by customer name, from the Customer table, and then by invoice
number from the Invoices table.
<P>
Choose the Ascending option to sort records from the beginning of the
alphabet, the lowest number, or the earliest date; choose the Descending
option to sort records from the end of the alphabet, the highest number, or
the latest date.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 6 of 7: Limiting the Contents of the Query</h3>
 
<P>
In this screen you can add an optional expression to further limit the
records retrieved by the query. The effect is like filtering the results so
that only records meeting certain criteria are included in the query
results. For example, you could limit the search to last names starting
with J by using the expression:
<P>
<PRE>   Customer.lastname BeginsWith J

</PRE>First select a field from the Fields list and an operator from the Operator
list. Then enter a comparison value in the Value field, and choose the Add
button to add the new expression to the expression box.
<P>
Entering Values:
<P>
In the Value field, type the value you want the query to compare the field
against. For example, if you are looking for customer records with a
particular last name, type that name in the Value box, after choosing the
last name field and the equal-sign operator. The resulting query expression
would look like this:
<P>
<PRE>   LAST_NAME = JOHNSON

</PRE>Combining Expressions:
<P>
You can create more complex queries by adding more expressions.
<P>
When you combine expressions, they are combined with an AND operator by
default. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   STATE = WA
   AND ORDER &gt; $100

</PRE>If you want the query to find records that match either expression, but not
both, choose the OR button to add an OR operator between expressions. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>   STATE = WA
   OR
   STATE = CA

</PRE>You can add parentheses around an expression to make sure the expressions
are evaluated as a unit. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   (STATE=WA
   OR
   STATE=CA)
   AND
   ORDER &gt; $100

</PRE>To Create an Expression:

<OL><P><LI>Select a field from the Fields list.

<P><LI>Select an operator from the Operator list.

<P><LI>Enter one or more values for comparison in the Value box.

<P><LI>Choose the Add button to add the resulting expression line to the
   expression box.

<P><LI>To check the results of the filter expression on the query, choose the
   Preview button.
<P>
</OL>To Remove an Expression:

<UL><LI>Select the expression line and choose the Remove button.
<P>
</UL><h3>Step 7 of 7: Previewing, Saving, and Browsing Your Query</h3>
 
<P>
Choose the Preview... button to see the results of your query in a Browse
window. If you are satisfied with the results, choose one of the following
options, and choose the Finish button.

<UL><LI>Save Query for Later Use: Creates a Client-Server query file (.CSQ
   extension) which you can run later.

<LI>Save and Run Query: Saves the query and displays the records in a Browse
   window.

<LI>Save and Create an AutoReport: Creates and runs an automatic report
   based on the fields in the query.
