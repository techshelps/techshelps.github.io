The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a CONFIG.FPW configuration file is marked as Included within the Project
Manager and this project is built into an EXE file, the -C Command line
cannot be used to override the built-in CONFIG.FPW.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You can work around this problem in one of two ways:

<UL><LI>Do not add the CONFIG.FPW to the project. Or, add it to the project but
   mark it Excluded. The CONFIG.FPW must be provided as a separate file
   but it can be overridden with a -c or -c&lt;other config filename&gt;.
<P>
   - or -

<LI>Give the configuration file a name other than CONFIG.FPW. The
   configuration file must always be specified on the Command line to be
   utilized but can be overridden by specifying -c or
   -c&lt;other config filename&gt;.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new project, TEST.PJX.

<P><LI>Add a main program, TEST.PRG, with the following contents:
<P>
   =Messagebox("Main program!")

<P><LI>Create a CONFIG.FPW file with the following contents:
<P>
   TITLE=Built in CONFIG was used

<P><LI>Add the CONFIG.FPW file to the project as a Text File. It will be marked
   Included by default.

<P><LI>Build an executable, TEST.EXE.

<P><LI>Create an alternate config file, OTHER.FPW, with the following contents:
<P>
   TITLE=Alternate CONFIG

<P><LI>From the Win95 RUN menu, execute:
<P>
   C:\&lt;directory with EXE&gt;\TEST.EXE -cOTHER.FPW
<P>
</OL>Despite the -c to override the built-in CONFIG file, the main Visual FoxPro
window appears with the title of "Built in CONFIG was used," demonstrating
that the built-in CONFIG.FPW file was used rather than OTHER.FPW.
<P>
There are two methods to work around the problem in the above example.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1:</h3>
 
<P>
Under step 4 above, add the following:
<P>
<PRE>   4a. In the Project Manager, right-click on the Config file and select
       Exclude.

</PRE></OL><h3>Method 2:</h3>
 
<P>
Change step 3 above to read:
<P>
<PRE>   3. Create a MYCONFIG.FPW file with the following contents:

      TITLE=Built in CONFIG was used

</PRE>Change step 4 above to read:
<P>
<PRE>   4. Add the MYCONFIG.FPW file to the project as a Text File.
      It will be marked Included by default.

</PRE>Now the built-in configuration file, MYCONFIG.FPW, can be utilized only by
specifying the configuration file, such as C:\&lt;directory with EXE&gt;\TEST.EXE
-cMYCONFIG.FPW. Use of -c will cause no configuration file to be used, and
-cOTHER.FPW will allow OTHER.FPW to be used.
