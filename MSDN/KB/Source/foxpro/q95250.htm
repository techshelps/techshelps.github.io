<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The DELETE command does not physically remove a record from the
database file. Instead, it places a flag on the record indicating that
the record has been deleted. The record can be retrieved by issuing
the RECALL command.
<P>
The PACK command physically removes deleted records from the file.
After the PACK command has been issued, deleted records cannot be
recalled. Using PACK requires exclusive use of the file.
<P>
In a multiuser environment, it may be difficult to obtain exclusive
use of the file for packing. If the file isn't packed, the amount of
disk space required to store deleted records will continue to grow. To
work around this problem, you can recycle deleted records by using the
technique illustrated below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following code snippets blank out all fields in the record when a
record is deleted from the file. When an attempt is made to append a
new record to the database, the program first checks to see if any
blank deleted records are available. If a deleted record is available,
the program uses the record to store the new data. If a deleted record
is not available, the program appends a blank record.
<P>
This code snippet deletes a record in FoxBASE+:
<P>
<PRE>   DELETE
   *   Insert code here to replace each field with a blank character,
   *   date or numeric value.

</PRE>This code snippet deletes a record in FoxPro:
<P>
<PRE>   IF LOCK()
      SCATTER MEMVAR MEMO BLANK   *  See note below on memo fields.
      GATHER MEMVAR MEMO          *  MEMO keyword available only
      DELETE                      *  in FoxPro 2.0.
   ENDIF

</PRE>The following line must be added to a FoxBASE+ or FoxPro 1.02 program
for databases that contain memo fields:
<P>
<PRE>   REPLACE memofield WITH ""  &amp;&amp; memofield is the memo field name

</PRE>This code snippet either recycles a deleted record or appends a new
blank record in FoxBASE+ and FoxPro:
<P>
<PRE>   LOCATE FOR DELETED()
   IF EOF()
      APPEND BLANK
   ELSE
      RECALL
   ENDIF

</PRE>Unused space in memo files will not be recycled. To recover unused
space in memo files, you must issue a PACK (FoxBASE+) or PACK MEMO
(FoxPro) command.
