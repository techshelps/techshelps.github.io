The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a Foxuser resource file is saved in the same directory as an executable
and this Foxuser file has been created with any toolbars visible, when the
executable is first run, the toolbars will appear. The toolbars, however,
will be inactive and if closed, will not reappear upon restarting the
executable.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is caused by having the Foxuser resource file in the same directory as
the executable. The Foxuser file is a resource file that records the state
of the development environment when last used. It retains such settings as
window placement and the toolbars that were left visible when Visual FoxPro
was closed. If a Foxuser resource file is not in the same directory as the
executable when this behavior occurs, it could be because there is a PATH=
system variable set to a directory that contains a Foxuser resource file.
This may or may not be the Foxuser resource file that is maintained in the
Vfp directory. Other Foxuser files may exist that are being referenced by
the executable via the PATH= system variable.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Include in the directory with the executable a Foxuser resource file that
has been created with the toolbars inactive or not visible.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new project in a different directory from Visual FoxPro.

<P><LI>Make a new form, and place a command button on it. In the button's Click
   event, place this line of code:
<P>
   CLEAR EVENTS

<P><LI>In the activate event of the form, place this line of code:
<P>
   READ EVENTS

<P><LI>Build the project into an executable in the directory created in step 1.

<P><LI>Close the project.

<P><LI>Before quitting Visual FoxPro, on the View menu, click Toolbars, and
   then select a couple of the check boxes of the toolbars. Click OK.

<P><LI>Quit Visual FoxPro.

<P><LI>Copy the Foxuser and Foxuser.fpt files from the Vfp directory to the
   same directory in which you built the executable.

<P><LI>Double-click the executable. The toolbars left open when you closed
   Visual FoxPro appear. The toolbars are not of any use and if undocked
   can be closed by clicking the close box in the upper-right of the title
   bar.

<P><LI>Click the button to exit the program. Restart the program to see that
<P><PRE>    the toolbars are no longer visible.
