The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use either the Visual FoxpPro Support Library PPC or Visual FoxPro
Support Library 68K to open a file in the Do Program File dialog box and
the file you are trying to open does not have an .exe file extension, an
error message is displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The name of the executable file selected does not have an .exe extension.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Add the .exe extension to the name of the executable file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When an executable file is built in the Visual FoxPro Project Manager, by
default the .exe file name extension is not added. When the executable is
double clicked, it starts with the appropriate Visual FoxPro Support
Library, assuming the library is present.
<P>
Alternately, the Visual FoxPro Support Library can be double clicked to
open the file.  It will then displays the Program to Do dialog box.
An executable file (.exe extension), application file (.app extension) or a
compiled program file (.fxp extension) can be selected to run. Unless the
All Files check box in this dialog box is selected, only files with
extensions of .exe, .app, and .fxp appear.
<P>
If the All Files check box is selected in the Do Program File dialog box
that appears after double clicking the Visual FoxPro Support Library, other
file types can be chosen. If an executable file without the .exe extension
or a .prg file that does not have a corresponding .fxp file is chosen the
following errror message occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   File '&lt;filename&gt;.prg' does not exist

</PRE>If a form (.scx extension) is selected, the following error occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;path&gt;:&lt;filename&gt;.scx is not an object file

</PRE>Forms cannot be run from the Visual FoxPro Support Library unless they are
built into an executable or converted to program code and compiled.
<P>
Note: 68K versions of an executable file can be tested on a PowerPC by
double clicking the Visual FoxPro (VFP) Support Library 68K and running the
executable. This is especially useful for testing ODBC applications since
PPC and 68K use different ODBC Setup control panels and ODBC SQL Server
drivers.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Type the following command in a new program file in Visual FoxPro:
<P>
<P><PRE>      WAIT WINDOW "This is a test"
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the program as Test.prg and create a new project named Test.pjx.
   Add the Test.prg to the project.

<P><LI>Build the project into an executable file named Test without the .exe
   extension.

<P><LI>Double click the Visual FoxPro Support Library PPC and locate the
   executable file built in step 3. Select the All Files check box so that
   the executable's name, Test, appears. Select Test, and then click the Do
   button. This error message appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      File 'Test.prg' does not exist
