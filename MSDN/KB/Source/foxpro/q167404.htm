The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When opening the ODBC Setup PPC control panel, the following error message
is received (usually endlessly):
<P>
<PRE>   An unexpected error occurred, because an error of type -192 occurred.

</PRE>Or after setting up a data source in the control panel, one or more of the
following symptoms are present:

<UL><LI>The Shutdown command on the Special menu in Finder is missing.

<LI>The Shutdown command on the Special menu in Finder is a long string of
   garbled text (high ASCII characters, hollow boxes, and so forth).

<LI>A message about there not being enough memory to keep open the window
   for the hard drive, even though no other applications are running.

<LI>The above message except part or all of it is the garbled text.

<LI>The problem clears up if the Macintosh is restarted.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is known to happen on PCI Power Macintoshes running System 7.5.5 when
running a PowerPC-enabled application. These applications seem to cause
Finder to hold onto additional memory creating an out-of-memory situation.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This has reportedly been fixed in System 7.6. In addition, the problem has
not been reported with System 7.5.3.
<P>
The following steps can also be used to correct the problem. They increase
Finder's heap size. These steps involve the use of the ResEdit resource
editor available from Apple Computer. Editing resources is for advanced
Macintosh users only. Microsoft does not directly support this. This
information is provided only as a convenience to our customers.

<OL><P><LI>Make a copy of Finder. The easiest way is to hold down the Option key
   while dragging it out of the System folder to another folder of your
   choice.

<P><LI>Start the ResEdit program.

<P><LI>Open the copy of the Finder that was made in Step 1 above.

<P><LI>Double-click the SIZE resource. A window titled "SIZEs from Finder"
   should appear.

<P><LI>Double-click the -1 ID. A window titled "SIZE ID = -1 from Finder"
   should appear. Scroll to the bottom of it.

<P><LI>Change both the Size and Min size settings to 239440. This should be an
   increase of 50000 for each.

<P><LI>Close the two windows and save the change to Finder. Then quit ResEdit.

<P><LI>Rename the Finder in the current System folder and then move in
   the new copy of Finder that was just changed in ResEdit.

<P><LI>Reboot the Macintosh and delete the old renamed Finder.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The ODBC Setup PPC control panel from Visigenic Software ships with Visual
FoxPro for Macintosh.
<P>
The Macintosh System software and ResEdit are manufactured by Apple
Computer Inc., a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On a PCI PowerMac running System 7.5.5, open the ODBC Setup PPC control
   panel.

<P><LI>If the error message is not received immediately, set up a data source
</OL>in the control panel, save it, and exit the control panel.

<OL><P><LI>Examine the Special menu in Finder.
