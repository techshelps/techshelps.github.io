The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.6 and 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are several ways in which you can create and use a splash screen
in an application. This article outlines two possible methods.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method One</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Using the Screen Builder, create a new screen. Under the menu option
   Screen, Layout, Window Style, make the window style type "Desktop". The
   logo or graphic you want to display can be stored in a General field of
   one of your system tables. If you want to display a bitmap logo, place a
   picture field on the screen and size it accordingly, or type the text
   you want to display on the screen as you ordinarily would.

<P><LI>Include the command #NOREAD as the first statement of your setup code.
   This will generate the screen but it will not be stopped by FoxPro
   issuing a READ command. Consequently, any fields you display on the
   screen will be displayed and program execution will continue.

<P><LI>Include the command at some point in your code, possibly in the menu
   Setup code:
<P>
   DO SPLASH.SPR
<P>
</OL>If in the future you want to clear off the splash screen, issue this
command:
<P>
<PRE>   MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN COLOR &lt;Color_Set&gt;
   CLEAR

</PRE></OL>While this is an excellent way to put up a splash screen, it does consume
memory resources and it may be difficult to size and scale the screen
appropriately, especially when you want your logo to take up the full
desktop.
<P>
As an alternative to the #NOREAD clause in the SETUP code, you could modify
the READ clause to this:
<P>
<PRE>   #READCLAUSES TIMEOUT &lt;expN1&gt;

</PRE>This displays the splash screen for a specific length of time and leaves
the RELEASE WINDOWS clause checked in the GENERATE SCREEN dialog. The
&lt;expN1&gt; clause is a numeric value that represents seconds.
<P>
NOTE: When using this method, you must place the following command in your
SETUP code:
<P>
<PRE>   SET CURSOR OFF

</PRE>This disables the cursor on the screen. To turn it back on, place the
following command in the CLEANUP code of the screen:
<P>
<PRE>   SET CURSOR ON

</PRE><h3>Method Two</h3>
 
<P>
The second method is much simpler. However, there are some fine points that
you'll need to keep in mind. Generally, this method would most likely work
best with a text-based bitmap on a solid background.

<OL><P><LI>Place the following commands in your code:
<P>
   ACTIVATE SCREEN
   @ 0,0 SAY "mylogo.bmp" BITMAP ISOMETRIC

<P><LI>Issue the following command to clear the screen:
<P>
   MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN
<P>
</OL>The following are the fine points you need to keep in mind when using this
method:

<OL><P><LI>If you do not want this command to be "path-specific" (that is,
   @ 0,0 SAY "C:\MYDIR\MYLOGO.BMP"), add the .BMP file to your project
   as a read-only object, or add the file into the project, mark it as
   excluded, and distribute it as a stand-alone file with your distributed
   .EXE file. Note, however, that a user could easily replace this .BMP
   file with an identically-named .BMP file and thus alter your
   application.

<P><LI>There are some major differences between using the ISOMETRIC versus
   using the STRETCH clause on the @ SAY command. The Help file explains
   this as follows:
<P>
   ISOMETRIC | STRETCH
<P>
   If the area specified with the SIZE clause is too small to contain a
   picture or OLE object, the picture is clipped to fit in the area. You
   can prevent a picture or OLE object from being clipped by including
   ISOMETRIC or STRETCH. If ISOMETRIC is included, the picture or object is
   scaled so that its proportions are maintained. The picture is shrunk or
   expanded to fit within the specified area and isn't distorted. If
   STRETCH is included, the picture or object is scaled horizontally,
   vertically or in both directions to fit the picture or object within the
   area specified by the SIZE clause. The picture or object's proportions
   are not maintained.
<P>
   How this will impact your application is that FoxPro will display the
   bitmap as you have requested, but if your screen or desktop is not sized
   accordingly, you may end up with a border around the bitmap. If it is
   acceptable and your picture looks okay when sized to fit, use the
   STRETCH parameter; otherwise use the ISOMETRIC parameter.

<P><LI>The name of the BMP file must be enclosed in quotation marks or the
   @ SAY will fail.

<P><LI>If you use this method on a Macintosh, FoxPro has an order of precedence
   in how it will search for the file referenced in the @ SAY:
<P>
   If you omit the extension for the picture file, FoxPro for Macintosh
   first looks for a picture file with the name you specified and a .BMP
   extension. If a picture file with a .BMP extension and the name you
   specified isn't found, FoxPro for Macintosh then looks for a file with
   the name you specified and a .PCT extension. If a picture file with a
   .PCT extension and the name you specified isn't found, FoxPro for
   Macintosh then looks for a picture file with the name you specified
   without an extension.
