<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Catalog Manager stores information about the currently selected catalog
in a "catalog file." A catalog file is an ordinary .DBF file with an .FPC
extension. The default file extension for the file containing memo fields
associated with a catalog file is .FCT. The default file extension for a
file containing memo fields associated with a typical .DBF file is .FPT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To support the concept of a catalog file, certain changes were made to the
USE command and to the CREATE TABLE command. If you CREATE an .FPC file and
the file has one or more memo fields, the associated memo file will be
created with an extension of .FCT.
<P>
For example, the following code will produce two files named TEST.FPC and
TEST.FCT:
<P>
<PRE>   CREATE TABLE test.fpc (one C(2), two M)

</PRE>By contrast, the following code will produce two files named TEST.DBF and
TEST.FPT:
<P>
<PRE>   CREATE TABLE test.dbf (one C(2), two M)

</PRE>If the extension of the file is anything other than .FPC and the file
contains a memo field, the associated file will have an extension of .FPT.
The .FCT extension is created only when the table has an extension of .FPC.
<P>
The USE command has also been modified to support .FPC files. If a database
file ending with an .FPC extension is USEd, and that database file has a
memo field, the USE command will search for a memo file with an .FCT
extension. If the USE command is issued to use a database file that does
not have an .FPC extension and the database file has a memo field, the USE
command will search for a memo file with a standard .FPT extension.
