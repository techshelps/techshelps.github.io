<P>
Question 1
<P>
When a second user loads Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS on
my network, the user receives the error message "File in
use by another." How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
If you are on a peer-to-peer network other than Windows
for Workgroups, you must first load MS-DOS SHARE and then
verify that the FoxPro files are marked as read only.
<P>
FoxPro uses a resource file called FOXUSER to store
information about windows, color sets, and other FoxPro
objects. The FOXUSER database can be shared only if the
file is marked read only. If you receive this error message
when you try to open a database file, make sure that all
users have the SET EXCLUSIVE setting OFF.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
In a network environment, where does FoxPro create
temporary files?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
FoxPro creates temporary files in the current working
directory unless you specifically designate an alternate
location by including one or more of the EDITWORK, SORTWORK,
PROGWORK and/or TMPFILES statements in the CONFIG.FP file.
<P>
If local workstations have sizable hard drives with plenty
of free space or have large amounts of RAM, you can improve
performance in the multiuser environment by placing FoxPro
temporary work files on the local drive or on a RAM drive.
Redirecting these files to a local drive or a RAM drive
provides additional speed by reducing the need to access
the network drive.
<P>
On small networks that have older workstations with slow
hard drives, you might experience better performance by
leaving FoxPro temporary files on the file server.  When
in doubt, direct temporary files to the local hard drive.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
I get "File Access Denied" Error Message When Writing to
File. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
The steps you must use to resolve this problem depends on
the network product you are using.
<P>
For a LANtastic network, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Check the files and locks on the SHARE command in the
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The following are the recommended
   settings:
<P>
<P><PRE>      share /f:5120 /l:500
</PRE>
<P><LI>Verify that the .EXE, .RSC, and .OVL files are marked
   as read-only. If necessary, change the security using
   the MS-DOS ATTRIB command (for example, ATTRIB +R
   &lt;filename&gt;).

<P><LI>Ensure that the CONFIG.FP file on the server redirects
   the OVERLAY= to a directory other than the directory
   containing the FOXPRO.EXE file.
<P>
</OL>For a Novell network, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Check the user's privileges.

<P><LI>Have the user log in as a supervisor and repeat the
   operation.

<P><LI>Ensure that the .EXE, .ESO and .ESL files are marked as
   read-only.  If necessary, change the security using the
   MS-DOS ATTRIB command (ATTRIB +R &lt;filename&gt;).
<P>
</OL>LANtastic is manufactured by Artisoft, Inc. and Novell
products by Novell, Inc., both vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
How do I resolve FoxPro "Sharing Violation Reading Drive"
Error?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
The following are six troubleshooting steps for this error:
<P>
<PRE>  - Verify that each user has a FOXUSER.DBF file.

  - Verify that the CONFIG.FP file on the server includes
    the EXCLUSIVE=OFF statement. If EXCLUSIVE=OFF is used,
    it is possible to share database files.

</PRE><LI>Verify that the CONFIG.FP file on the server includes the
   RESOURCE=OFF statement, or that each user's FOXUSER.DBF
   and FOXUSER.FPT files are marked as read-only.
<P>
  - If you are using the LAN version of FoxPro version 2.0, verify
<P><PRE>    that the FOXPROL.EXE, FOXPROLX.EXE, and FOXR.EXE files are marked
    as read-only. If you are using FoxPro version 2.5 for MS-DOS,
    verify that the FOXPRO.EXE, FOXPROX.EXE, and FOXR.EXE files are
    marked as read-only.
</PRE>
<LI>If you use the Distribution Kit to create a standalone
   application, verify that the .EXE files are marked as
   read-only.

<LI>If you create compact executable files, mark the .ESL and
   .ESO files as read-only.

<LI>In some cases, the SHARE utility must be loaded on the
   server and on each workstation. Specify the /F and /L
   parameters as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SHARE /F:5120 /L:500
</UL></PRE>

<P><h2>Part 2: Converting from FoxPro Version 2.0 to 2.6 for MS-DOS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 
<P>
1   Are my existing FoxPro version 2.0 screens and reports
<PRE>    compatible with FoxPro version 2.6?
</PRE></OL>2   Can I use my existing library files created with the FoxPro
<PRE>    version 2.0 Library Construction Kit in FoxPro version 2.6?
</PRE>3   Are my existing programs compiled under FoxPro version 2.0
<PRE>    compatible with FoxPro version 2.6?
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
Are my existing FoxPro version 2.0 screens and reports compatible
with FoxPro version 2.6?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
The structures of the databases created by the power tools have changed in
FoxPro version 2.6.  When you first open screen and report files created in
FoxPro version 2.0, FoxPro version 2.6 ask if you want to convert them to
FoxPro version 2.6 format.  This conversion is a one-way process -- files
that have been converted to 2.6 formats may no longer be opened in 2.0. You
may want to make backups before converting.  For more information about
specific FoxPro version 2.6 file formats, see "Tables" in the Update
manual.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
Can I use my existing library files created with the FoxPro version 2.0
Library Construction Kit in FoxPro version 2.6?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
Library files created with the FoxPro version 2.0 Library
Construction Kit must be relinked before they can be used
in FoxPro version 2.6.
<P>
The directory FPD26\GOODIES\LCKUPDAT contains files that allow you to
update PLBs built using the FoxPro version 2.0 Library Construction Kit for
use with FoxPro version 2.6 for
MS-DOS.  If you obtained your PLBs from another source,
such as a software supplier or online service, contact
that source for updated libraries that work with
FoxPro version 2.6.  To use these files, follow the directions in
the LCKUPDAT.TXT file located in the
FPD26\GOODIES\LCKUPDAT directory.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
Are my existing programs compiled under FoxPro version 2.0
compatible with FoxPro version 2.6?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
Programs compiled under FoxPro version 2.0, such as .APP and .FXP
files, are not compatible with FoxPro version 2.6.  To run such
applications or programs in FoxPro version 2.6, you must rebuild
or recompile them.  For more information about rebuilding
FoxPro version 2.0 applications, see "Using Files From Other
Platforms" in the Update manual.
 
 
<P><h2>Part 3: Printing Issues</h2>

    How can I correct this problem?
</PRE>11  I get the following error "File ["&lt;File&gt;"] Does Not Exist"
<PRE>    printing on LAN Manager.  How do I correct this problem?
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
When I try to print boxes, ASCII characters are printed
instead of boxes. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
If you are using an HP LaserJet printer, the default
character set does not include line drawing characters.
You can change the default character set by using the
controls on the front panel of the printer. You will
want to set your default to the PC-8 character set.
<P>
If you are not using an HP LaserJet printer and are
using printer drivers, in the Printer Setup dialog,
specify a printer setup appropriate for your printer.
If you are already using a printer driver, modify the
P_CODES database in order to send the proper code for
your printer, and rebuild the GENPD.APP file. If you
aren't using a printer driver, send the proper escape
codes to the printer before you print using the
??? command.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
I'm using the Relational Query By Example (RQBE) system
to send data to a report. The data in the report is
incorrect; the report prints the same record over and over.
How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
When you created the report, you used alias names in your
field definitions. To correct the report, simply remove the
alias names. For example, a field containing CUSTOMER.NAME
should be modified to contain only NAME.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
Why can't I select the printer driver check box in the
Printer Setup dialog box?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
This problem occurs if you are missing the GENPD.APP file,
if the _GENPD memory variable is set incorrectly, if the
resource file is turned off, or if the FOXUSER file is
missing, damaged, or marked as read only.
 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
I'm using a Novell network. I can print by using the
Novell CAPTURE command, but the SET PRINTER TO \\SPOOLER
command doesn't work. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
If you are receiving the error message "Printer not ready,"
make sure that there are no spaces before or after the
\\SPOOLER clauses of SET PRINTER. If the printer information
doesn't print until you exit FoxPro, you must issue the
SET PRINT TO command in order to release the print spooler.
 
<P>
Question 5
<P>
I can't make the printer drivers work in an executable
file. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 5
<P>
Open the project to make sure that the GENPD.APP file is
included in the project as an application. If it isn't
included, add GENPD.APP to the project as an application.
<P>
To add GENPD.APP as an application, choose the Add push
button. In the dialog that appears, choose
Application from the Type popup, select GENPD.APP and then
choose the Add push button.
<P>
Note: GENPD.APP is automatically marked as an excluded
project element.
<P>
Rebuild the project and your executable file. Make sure
that you distribute the GENPD.APP, FOXUSER.DBF,
FOXUSER.FPT, and FOXSWAP.COM files with your executable
file.
 
<P>
Question 6
<P>
How do I start a Print Job from a Page Other Than Page 1?
<P>
Answer 6
<P>
To start a print job at a location other than page 1, set
_PBPAGE to the number of the page at which printing should
start and create a program that uses the
PRINTJOB...ENDPRINTJOB commands.
<P>
Using the _PBPAGE variable to specify the page number where
a print job starts does not work outside of
PRINTJOB...ENDPRINTJOB.
<P>
For example, suppose your printer jammed on page 75 of a
100-page report and all output from page 75 through 100 was
lost. The code to re-create the last 25 pages is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   _PBPAGE=75
   PRINTJOB
   REPORT FORM C:\FOXPRO2\test.FRX ;
      ENVIRONMENT PDSETUP TO PRINT
   ENDPRINTJOB

</PRE>Or, if you just wanted to only print page 75, then set
"_PBPAGE=75" and "_PEPAGE=75" in the previous example.
 
<P>
Question 7
<P>
I am having problems printing  Labels on a Laser Printer
without a printer driver.
How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 7
<P>
Printing labels to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) laser printer
without a printer driver requires that certain escape codes
be sent to the printer before the command to print the labels.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Avery 5161 or 5261 labels measure 1-by-4 inches. One page
of labels has two columns of ten labels each. To print this
label type, execute code such as the following:
<P>
<PRE>   SET PDSETUP TO
   ??? CHR(27)+'E'        &amp;&amp; Reset
   ??? CHR(27)+'&amp;l8.00C'  &amp;&amp; Line height 8/48" (LPI 6)
   ??? CHR(27)+'&amp;l3E'     &amp;&amp; Top margin 3 lines
   ??? CHR(27)+'&amp;l56P'    &amp;&amp; Page length 60 lines
   SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
   LABEL FORM &lt;labelname&gt; TO PRINTER NOCONSOLE

   NOTE: The escape code lines that contain an ampersand
   (&amp;) use a lowercase "L", not a number 1.

</PRE>In the label generator, use the following settings:
<P>
<PRE>   Margin - 3
   Width  - 34
   Number across - 2
   Height - 6
   Lines between - 0

</PRE>The above settings are only an example and may need to be
modified for specific labels, printers, and applications.
For exact escape code sequences, consult your printer's
manual.
 
<P>
Question 8
<P>
I get the following error "Cannot Write to Read-Only File"
<PRE> When Printing Report. How can I correct this problem?

</PRE>Answer 8
<P>
Given the following circumstances, the error message "Cannot
Write to a Read-Only File" will occur when you try to print
a report from within an application (.APP) or an executable
(.EXE) program:

<UL><LI>The resource file is included in the project.

<LI>The resource is set to the included filename.

<LI>The REPORT FORM &lt;name&gt; PDSETUP TO PRINT or
   LABEL FORM &lt;name&gt; PDSETUP TO
   PRINT command is issued.
<P>
</UL>There are two ways to avoid this problem:

<UL><LI>Remove PDSETUP from the command.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Mark the resource file as excluded and ship it along with
   the .APP or .EXE file.
</UL> 
<P>
Question 9
<P>
I get an extra blank line when printing labels.
How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 9
<P>
This behavior existed in dBASE III and FoxBASE. It was
changed in FoxPro version 1.02. However, to maintain
compatibility with the large installed base of Xbase
applications, a design decision was made to revert to the
original behavior.
<P>
To work around this problem, print the label form to a file,
open the file with low-level file functions, remove the
carriage return/linefeed (CR/LF) characters and send the
file to the printer using the MS-DOS COPY command.
For example:
<P>
<PRE>   *--Set the number of lines printed per page and print to a file.
   _PLENGTH=56
   LABEL FORM &lt;form name&gt; ENVIRONMENT PDSETUP TO FILE temp.txt

   *--Open file and replace the CR/LF pair with null characters.
   filehand=FOPEN('temp.txt',2)
   =FGETS(filehand)
   =FSEEK(filehand,-2,1)
   =FWRITE(filehand,chr(0)+chr(0))
   =FCLOSE(filehand)

   *--Copy the file to printer and prevent the appearance of the
   *--MS-DOS screen.
   HIDE WINDOW SAVE ALL
   RUN COPY temp.txt LPT1 &gt; NUL
   SHOW WINDOW ALL
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 10
<P>
I have NewPage and ResetPage enabled in my data grouping but
my page numbering is not reset to 1.
How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 10
<P>
The report has a Bottom Margin setting greater than 0 (zero).
<P>
Set Bottom Margin to 0 and add the necessary lines to the Page
Footer band. For example, if Bottom Margin is set to 2, reset
it to 0 and add two lines to the Page Footer band.
 
<P>
Question 11
<P>
I get the following error "File ["&lt;File&gt;"] Does Not Exist"
printing on LAN Manager.  How do I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 11
<P>
When the program attempts to open a file, it looks in a
particular directory. If it does not find the file there it
tries other directories until the file is found. When LAN
Manager's "chartime" timer (which defaults to 250 milliseconds)
expires, it sends a spool close message to the workstation,
and if the program is in the middle of a search for the
next file to open, the program exits incorrectly with the
error mentioned above.
<P>
If the chartime parameter in the LANMAN.INI file for the
workstation is set to a sufficiently high value, the program
will not be interrupted by the spool close message and will
work correctly.
<P>
In LAN Manager version 2.1, the chartime parameter controls
the amount of time the spooler waits for additional print
data before closing the current spool file and printing it.
In earlier versions of LAN Manager, this parameter controls
the amount of time to wait for pipe data or comm queue
data.
<P>
For more information about the chartime parameter and the
LANMAN.INI file, refer to the LAN Manager documentation or
contact Microsoft LAN Manager Product Support Services.
<P>
Also, see the "Microsoft LAN Manager Administrator's
Reference," version 2.1, page 225

<P>
Question 1
<P>
Every time I try to generate a specific screen, I have to
add my supporting screens to the screen set. How can I
avoid this problem?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
To save these options, you must create a project and
include the screens as a screen set.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
When I create a screen set with more than one window, how
do I move the cursor from one window to the next?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
If all the windows in your screen set are controlled
with one READ command, use the Page Up key, the Page Down
key, or modify the value of the _CUROBJ system memory
variable to cycle through the windows of your screen set.
If any one of the windows in your screen set is not
controlled by the READ command, such as a Browse window,
then you must press CTRL+F1 to cycle through the screen set.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
How do I coordinate Browse Windows with Screens?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
Page D2-96 of the FoxPro for MS-DOS "Developers Guide" give
samples for coordinating Browse windows with screens but omits
the SAVE clause in the example. If the optional BROWSE
parameter SAVE is omitted, the Browse window will close
as soon as any other object is clicked.
<P>
The code example should be changed to read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   IF NOT WVISIBLE("Client List")
      BROWSE NORMAL NOWAIT NODELETE LAST TITLE "Client List" ;
         NOAPPEND NOMENU SAVE FIELDS company ;
         WHEN showgets()
   ENDIF

   IF NOT WVISIBLE("Account Details")
      SELECT details
         BROWSE NORMAL NOWAIT NODELETE LAST TITLE "Client List" ;
            NOAPPEND NOMENU SAVE  ;
            FIELDS ;
            Trans_type:10, ;
            Trans_date:10, ;
            Amt:7,Service
      SELECT clients
   ENDIF
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
How to Page Through a Format File That Contains a READ?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
Pressing the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys skips one record
at a time, forward or backward, in the database and also
refreshes the GETs on the screen.
<P>
Objects can be placed on different pages or different screens
by placing a READ command in the format file. The READ command
should be placed after the last GET that would appear on each
screen. The following format file example places two objects
on the first screen and two more on the second screen. To
display the objects that are on the next screen, press the
PAGE UP or PAGE DOWN key.
<P>
<PRE>      @5,1 GET &lt;var1&gt;
      @6,1 GET &lt;var2&gt;
      READ
      @5,1 GET &lt;var3&gt;
      @6,1 GET &lt;var4&gt;
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 5
<P>
The Cycle Command does not work for desktop screens.
How can I correct this?
<P>
<P>
Answer 5
<P>
The Cycle command on the Window menu is designed to switch
between windows defined on the desktop. When a screen set
contains several windows and a desktop screen, Cycle stops
on the desktop screen. This is normal behavior, since the
Cycle command is intended to be used with window screens,
not the desktop.
<P>
To work around this behavior, define a window with no borders
instead of using a desktop screen. This will produce a window
that looks like the desktop.
<P>
The Cycle command is used for cycling through window screens
in a screen set or windows defined on the desktop. The
shortcut key CTRL+F1 can also be used to cycle through
windows on the desktop.

<P><h2>Part 5: Importing Data</h2>
 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
How do I import a data file into Microsoft FoxPro for
MS-DOS?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
To import a data file, use either the IMPORT command or
the APPEND FROM command. If you're receiving the error
message "String too long to fit," make sure that no
"field" in the source data file exceeds the field
capacity for a FoxPro table. See the System Capacities
topic in Help for additional information. A wide range of
file formats is supported. See the Language Reference
manual for a complete list of the supported file formats.

Question 1
<P>
I modified the structure of my database, but when I use
the BROWSE command to view the file, I don't see the
changes.
How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
You are most likely using the BROWSE command from the
System menu or the View panel, or you are issuing a BROWSE
LAST or BROWSE PREFERENCE command from the Command window.
To see these structural changes, you must first issue a
plain BROWSE command from the Command window to display
the new default representation of the database.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
When I press the CTRL+N key combination in my program to
append a new record in the Browse window, I get the musical
note instead. How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
CTRL+N is a shortcut key combination associated with the
System menu. In your program, you must issue the SET
SYSMENU ON command and/or use a BROWSE command instead of
the BROWSE NOMENU command.

<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 
<P>
1   I've created an application that doesn't allow me to
<PRE>    edit my database files.  How can I correct this problem?
</PRE>2   Why can't I build an executable file from within my
<PRE>    project?  The options to do so are dimmed and
    unavailable.
</PRE>3   When I attempt to build an executable file, I receive
<PRE>    the error message "Link command failed."  How can I
    correct this problem?
</PRE>4   My executable file runs correctly under the development

    available" under the stand-alone version.  How can I
    correct this problem?
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
I've created an application that does not allow me to
edit my database files.  How can I correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
Mark your database as excluded in the project, then
rebuild your application.  You must distribute these files
to your end users. Including the database in the project
automatically makes these files read only.
 
<P>
Question 2
<P>
Why can't I build an executable file from within my project?
The options to do so are dimmed and unavailable.
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
To build an executable file, you must purchase the
Microsoft FoxPro Distribution Kit and install it in your
FoxPro directory.  Prior to installing the FoxPro
Distribution Kit, make sure that the FoxPro files are not
marked as read only.
 
<P>
Question 3
<P>
When I attempt to build an executable file, I receive the
error message "Link command failed." How can I correct
this problem?
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
If you receive this error message, check the following
items:
<P>
* Make sure that you have enough conventional memory.
* Make sure that you have enough disk space.
* Increase the number of file handles available to FoxPro.
<PRE>  To do this, you can increase the FILES setting in the
  CONFIG.SYS file or increase the FILE HANDLES setting in
  the SHELL.CFG file. This is specific to Novell networks.
</PRE>* Make sure that FoxPro can find your COMMAND.COM file.
* Make sure that the following files are on your path:
<PRE>  WLINK8.EXE, and FOXSWAP.COM.
</PRE>* If you are running the 32-bit Extended Version of FoxPro,
<PRE>  make sure that DOSMEM isn't set to ON in your CONFIG.FP
  file. For more information on DOSMEM, refer to "Customizing
  FoxPro" in the Installation and Configuration guide.
</PRE> 
<P>
Question 4
<P>
My executable file runs correctly under the development
version, but I receive the error message "Feature not
available" under the stand-alone version. How can I
correct this problem?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
First, check the "Features Not Available" list in the
FoxPro Distribution Kit documentation.  Certain features
used for development aren't available in the applications
and executables you create. If you still encounter
problems, it's possible that you're using macro
substitution in your program. The recommended workaround
is to set up a statement which causes the compiler to see
the possible options for the macro-substituted commands
so that they will be compiled into the .EXE file.
For example:
<P>
<PRE> IF .F.
   MODIFY REPORT dummy
   MODIFY LABEL dummy
 ENDIF

</PRE>This code allows the compiler to see the MODIFY REPORT and
MODIFY LABEL commands, but because it is never executed,
the report and label names can be meaningless (dummy).
