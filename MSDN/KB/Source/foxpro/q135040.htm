<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When Visual FoxPro packs a table to remove deleted records, any
non-structural index open at the time is closed. However, when a program
subsequently uses the table that depends on its indexed order, the program
will not perform as expected and may give unexpected error messages.
<P>
When Visual FoxPro packs a table to remove deleted records, any regular
structural compound index (one with the same name as the
table and with a .cdx extension) open at the time is not closed.
<P>
This is different from the behavior of previous versions of FoxPro.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Explicitly re-open the index file and use the REINDEX command before
proceeding with the program.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. The problem has been fixed in
Visual FoxPro 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Type the following commands into a Visual FoxPro program, and then run it.
<P>
<PRE>   ***  Program to demonstrate the effect of PACK
   ***  on open index files in Visual FoxPro
   ***  Test program named Testpack.prg

   CLEAR
   SET SAFETY OFF
   CLEAR ALL
   CLOSE ALL

   ********Creation of testfile
   DECLARE new_dbf[1,4]
   new_dbf[1,1] = "Pagenum"
   new_dbf[1,2] = "N"
   new_dbf[1,3] = 4
   new_dbf[1,4] = 0

   SELECT 0
   CREATE TABLE temptabl FROM ARRAY new_dbf   &amp;&amp; It's in USE
   INDEX ON Deleted() TAG Deleted             &amp;&amp; .CDX is also in USE
   INDEX ON Pagenum TAG Pagenum
   SET ORDER TO
   COPY TO Temptbl2 WITH PRODUCTION           &amp;&amp; On the disk so
   RENAME Temptbl2.dbf TO testfile.dbf        &amp;&amp; Can rename.
   RENAME Temptbl2.cdx TO testfile.pax        &amp;&amp; Now not structural.
   *  Index file has multiple tags. It is a non-structural compound
   *  index file. A single index file with the extension of .idx
   *  will also demonstrate the issue.

   USE testfile INDEX testfile.pax ALIAS testfile EXCLUSIVE
   SET ORDER TO

   **** Add some records then delete some
   SELECT testfile
   FOR q = -10 to 50                          &amp;&amp; 60 records
     APPEND BLANK
     REPLACE Pagenum WITH q

     + chr(13) + ;
     "The index file was closed and could be deleted."
   CLOSE ALL

   ERASE temptabl.dbf  &amp;&amp; Clean up afterwards.
   ERASE temptabl.cdx
   ERASE temptbl2.dbf
   ERASE temptbl2.cdx
   ERASE testfile.dbf
