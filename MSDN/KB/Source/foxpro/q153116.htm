The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Files created from Visual FoxPro's Support Libraries will have a creator of
FOXX, rather than the library's signature FOXL or FOXS. This problem will
occur with every file created from the library and with commands such as
PACK that create and rename temporary files. This problem will also affect
how documents are associated with their creator's icon and launching
behavior via the document.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is a limitation of Visual FoxPro and the Visual FoxPro support
libraries. Although the libraries will operate with a custom creator,
icons, and signature, they do not stamp the files created with the creator.
The creator "FOXX" will be stamped on all created files, regardless of the
library's creator or signature.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Use the FoxTools function, fxSetType(), or a third-party utility, such
   as ResEdit or File Buddy, to restore the desired creator;
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Create an ALSM or CFM library to create files with the correct creator,
   or alter the creator of created files;
<P>
   -or-

<LI>For use on partitions that do not have any version of FoxPro installed,
   change the library's creator and signature to FOXX.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual FoxPro libraries have different signatures to facilitate their
coexistence on the same volume as the development environment and to handle
executables properly. Below is a table of applications and their
corresponding signatures.
<P>
<PRE>   Application                   Signature
   --------------------------    ---------
   Microsoft Visual FoxPro       FOXX
   VFP Support Library PPC       FOXL
   VFP Support Library 68K       FOXS

</PRE><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Take the following PRG and build it to a PowerMac and 68K Executable. Copy
the Executable and the appropriate library to a new folder.
<P>
Macintosh alerts will display the creator and type of a DBF after creation,
custom stamping, and a subsequent PACK. The following example should
illustrate the problem and give some code examples to implement a
workaround in code:
<P>
<PRE>   CREA TABLE Fruit ( cID C(2), cKind C(10) ) &amp;&amp; Create a new table
   cID = "AP"
   cKind = "Apple"
   INSERT INTO Fruit FROM MEMVAR

   cID = "OR"
   cKind = "Orange"
   INSERT INTO Fruit FROM MEMVAR

   cID = "CH"
   cKind = "Cherry"
   INSERT INTO Fruit FROM MEMVAR

   cTable = SYS( 2027, DBF() ) &amp;&amp; Mac Path version of the table path
   USE

   SET LIBRARY TO HOME() + "FOXTOOLS.CFM"

   * ShowInfo is a simple function below to display the current
   *    creator and type.
   cFileType=SHOWINFO('Original', cTable)

   * Set the Creator
   cFileType = cFileType &amp;&amp; Same as before
   cFileCreator = 'ZZZZ' &amp;&amp; Custom creator or FOXL/FOXS for PPC/68K
   =FxSetType( cTable, cFileType, cFileCreator)

   cFileType=SHOWINFO('Stamped', cTable)

   USE (cTable)
   GO TOP
   DELETE
   PACK
   USE

   cFileType=SHOWINFO('PACKed', cTable)

   * Unload the library
   SET LIBRARY TO

   PROCEDURE showInfo
     LPARAMETER cMessage, cTable

     * What creator does the file have
     STORE "" to cFileType, cFileCreator
     =FxFileType( cTable, @cFileType, @cFileCreator )

     nIconNumber = 2       &amp;&amp; Note icon
     nResourceNumber = 257 &amp;&amp; Continue button
     nHorizontal = -1      &amp;&amp; Default position
     nVertical = -1      &amp;&amp; Default position
     cText1 = cMessage + " " + cTable  + CHR(13)
     cText2 = "Creator = '" + cFileType + "'  Type = '"  + ;
          cFileCreator + "'"
     =FxAlert( nIconNumber, nResourceNumber, nHorizontal, nVertical, ;
          cText1,  cText2 )

     RETURN cFileType
