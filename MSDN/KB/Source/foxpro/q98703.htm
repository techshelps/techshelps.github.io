The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5 and 2.5a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The SET KEYCOMP command, supported only in FoxPro for Windows, determines
the keystrokes being used to move through the FoxPro for Windows interface
and allows you to specify whether to use MS-DOS- or Windows-style
keystrokes and the keystroke combinations used to navigate through such
interface controls as buttons, lists, and popups.
<P>
To navigate using MS-DOS-style keystrokes, issue the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET KEYCOMP TO DOS

</PRE>To navigate using Windows-style keystrokes, issue the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET KEYCOMP TO WINDOWS

</PRE>The effect of the SET KEYCOMP setting depends on the type of the control,
as described below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
SET KEYCOMP affects the different controls as follows:
<P>
<P><h3>Default Buttons</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Result of SET KEYCOMP TO DOS:
<P>
   The default button in a dialog box is always the same and is chosen
   by pressing CTRL+ENTER.

<LI>Result of SET KEYCOMP TO WINDOWS:
<P>
   The default button in a dialog box can change as the focus moves
   between controls. The default button is surrounded by a bolder
   border to indicate it is the current default; it is chosen by
   pressing ENTER. Pressing ENTER always performs the default button's
   action.
<P>
   NOTE: For an illustration of how the default button changes in a
   dialog box, issue SET KEYCOMP TO WINDOWS and press TAB to move
   through the Open dialog box.
<P>
</UL><h3>Popups</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Result of SET KEYCOMP TO DOS:
<P>
   Popups are opened by pressing ENTER or the SPACEBAR. Keyboard
   steering within a popup is unavailable until the popup is open.

<LI>Result of SET KEYCOMP TO WINDOWS:
<P>
   Popups are opened by pressing the SPACEBAR, ALT+UP ARROW or
   ALT+DOWN ARROW. Keyboard steering within a popup is available when
   the popup is selected (not open) and when it is open.
<P>
   For example, a selected popup contains a list of available drives.
   If drives A, B, and C are available and drive B is currently
   displayed, you can choose drive C without opening the popup by
   pressing C or the DOWN ARROW key.
<P>
</UL><h3>Hot Keys</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Result of SET KEYCOMP TO DOS:
<P>
   A hot key for a control is a single key. If the current focus is
   not in a control that has keyboard steering (a popup or a list),
   pressing the hot key moves the focus to the control and chooses it.

<LI>Result of SET KEYCOMP TO WINDOWS:
<P>
   A hot key for a control can be a single key or a key combination.
   If the current control has keyboard steering (a popup or a list),
   pressing ALT and the hot key to will move the focus to the control.
   To move to other controls, press the hot key or ALT and the hot
   key.
<P>
</UL><h3>Radio Buttons</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Result of SET KEYCOMP TO DOS:
<P>
   Pressing the TAB key when a group of radio buttons is selected
   moves among the radio buttons.

<LI>Result of SET KEYCOMP TO WINDOWS:
<P>
   Pressing the TAB key when a group of radio buttons is selected
   moves the current focus from the radio buttons to the next control.
   To move among buttons in a set of radio buttons, press the LEFT
   ARROW and RIGHT ARROW keys.
<P>
   NOTE: You can specify a startup KEYCOMP setting in FoxPro for
   Windows in CONFIG.FPW configuration file. For example, to set
   KEYCOMP to DOS, place the following line in the CONFIG.FPW
   configuration file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      KEYCOMP = DOS
