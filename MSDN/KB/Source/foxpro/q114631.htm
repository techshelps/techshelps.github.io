The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5x, 2.6a
<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you suspect that you have a damaged FoxPro floppy disk, first verify
that the disk itself is damaged. Make sure that there is not another
problem with the system or hardware that interferes with the Setup program.
<P>
If your disk is indeed damaged, call the Microsoft Sales Information
Center at (800) 426-9400 to obtain new FoxPro disks.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Common Error Messages</h3>
 
<P>
You may receive one of the following error messages during Setup:

<UL><LI>Please insert disk: &lt;diskname&gt;
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The file "&lt;filename&gt;" appears to be missing from the installation
   disk. You may either continue installation with the remaining
   files, or stop Setup.
<P>
</UL><h3>Start the Macintosh Without INITs and CDEVs</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: FoxPro for Macintosh requires Macintosh System 7 or later.
<P>
Complete the following steps to start the Macintosh without loading system
extensions (INITs) or Control Panel devices (CDEVs):

<OL><P><LI>Restart the Macintosh.

<P><LI>Hold down the SHIFT key while the computer reboots and until the message
   "Welcome to Macintosh. Extensions Off." is displayed.
<P>
   NOTE: Some computer configurations require certain INITs or CDEVs to
   function properly. These include systems that use third-party hardware,
   such as monitors, accelerators, network cards, and so forth. Some
   password-protection programs require INITs to decrypt the boot sector of
   the hard disk and to allow startup.
<P>
   CAUTION: PREPARE A BOOTABLE FLOPPY DISK FOR YOUR PARTICULAR HARDWARE
   CONFIGURATION BEFORE ALTERING THE SYSTEM FOLDER ON YOUR HARD DISK.

<P><LI>Run the FoxPro Setup program again.
<P>
</OL><h3>Rebuild the Desktop on the FoxPro Floppy Disk</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the FoxPro disk is not locked (that the sliding tab is
   shut).

<P><LI>While holding down the COMMAND and OPTION keys, insert the FoxPro disk
   into the floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>When you are prompted to rebuild the Desktop file, choose OK.

<P><LI>Run the FoxPro Setup program again.
<P>
</OL><h3>Other Troubleshooting Suggestions</h3>
 
<P>
If the procedures listed above do not solve your problem, try the
following:

<UL><LI>Install FoxPro on a different Macintosh.
<P>
   If the FoxPro disks work on another Macintosh, the problem may be with
   your floppy disk drive.

<LI>Copy the contents of the floppy disk to the hard disk.
<P>
   If the floppy disk does not successfully copy to the hard disk, try
   copying a different floppy disk (one not included with FoxPro) to the
   hard disk. If that floppy disk copies to the hard disk successfully, it
   is likely that the FoxPro floppy disk is damaged.
