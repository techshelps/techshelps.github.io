The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh version 2.6a
<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Under Windows, FoxPro executables have an .exe extension, and it is
possible to have one executable call another. FoxPro for Macintosh
executables are not built with the .exe extension by default. FoxPro for
Macintosh executables have no extension by default. Executables built with
no extension cannot be called by another executable. A "file not found"
message is returned. To allow an executable to call another executable,
place an .exe extension on the name of the called executable.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps demonstrate how one executable file can call another
executable on the Macintosh.

<OL><P><LI>Create a project called FIRST with one program that contains code
   similar to this:
<P>
   WAIT WINDOW "ONE"
   DO SECOND

<P><LI>Create a project called SECOND with one program that contains:
<P>
   WAIT WINDOW "TWO"

<P><LI>Build both projects so that the executables are both in the same folder.

<P><LI>Close FoxPro, and open the folder containing the two executables.
   Double-click the executable called FIRST. When it tries to execute the
   line DO SECOND, the message "File 'Second' does not exist" will appear.

<P><LI>Replace the line DO SECOND with DO SECOND.EXE. When building the second
   executable give it the name SECOND.EXE. The first executable will now be
   able to call the second executable successfully.
<P>
</OL>Also note that if the calling executable (FIRST) is built after the called
executable (SECOND), the message "Unable to find proc./func. SECOND" will
appear during the build. When the .exe extension is added to the executable
it will be placed in the project as an application and marked as excluded.
<P>
