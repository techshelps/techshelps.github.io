<P>
Functional FoxPro, page 14. Saving and Restoring Indexes. By Malcolm C.
Rubel. An index is easy to create, but is it easy to recreate after it's
lost or damaged? It is if you adopt the techniques in this article. IDX,
CDX.
<P>

Liskin. Finding duplicate records, grouping, summary statistics, SELECT,

<P>
Developer Toolbox, page 22. Recycling Deleted Records. By Bill Lawder.
APPEND BLANK is one of the oldest and most widely used FoxPro commands, but
in most situations, you shouldn't use it! The technique in this article is
a smarter way to add records. INSERT INTO, GATHER, and REPLACE are, in some
ways, inefficient. SET DELETED, PACK, RECALL, RAT, IIF, SET ORDER TO TAG.
<P>
FoxPro Tip, page 28. TRANSFORM()- Expressions with Style. By John D.
Hosier. What a PICTURE clause does for fields in your screens and reports,
the function TRANSFORM() can do for your character expressions. SUBSTR()
<P>
International FoxPro, page 29. Handling Text as Data. By Peter Somers.
Developing a multi-lingual application requires translating phrases between
human languages. You can automate this task by having FoxPro help you. But
handling text as if it is data can be very challenging. This article shows
you how. Parse, Parsing text phrases, eliminating array subscripts, dealing
with TEXT ... ENDTEXT blocks, searching for the quoted phrase.
<P>
Database Management, page 34. Fast Record Counting with an Index. By Tom
Lewinson. When an index is active, how can you determine the relative
record position in the index? This article uses clever techniques, and
Rushmore, to do a variety of measurements on an indexed table. RECNO(), SET
DELETED ON, tag on DELETED().
<P>
Menu Management, page 42. Add Custom Capabilities Easily. By Mike McKelvy.

programs to be added to the menu system and be run from the menu without
making any changes to the original program.
<P>
Update, page 43. Q&amp;A Solution from February 94 for page break in a report
does not work in FoxPro for Windows, because there is no way to determine
the current print line for comparison with the number of lines wanted.
<P>
FoxPro Tip, page 44. Using ON SHUTDOWN for Automatic Time Out. By Drew
Speedie. The ON SHUTDOWN procedure can provide a global yet graceful way to
terminate an application. This is essentially the same as using TIMEOUT in
the application, except that you shut down programmatically when you
determine that termination of a READ / BROWSE resulted from executing a
TIMEOUT clause.
<P>
