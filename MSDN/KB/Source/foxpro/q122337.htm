The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A screen created in FoxPro for Windows by using the Wizards won't run
correctly in FoxPro for MS-DOS. You see blinking and flashes when you
attempt to run the resulting SPR code in FoxPro for MS-DOS.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs because the Windows GUI environment has a larger display area
than MS-DOS.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To run Wizard-generated code on the MS-DOS platform, you must copy the
Wizard-created .SCX and associated .SCT file to the MS-DOS environment.
Then use the Transporter to convert them for use in the native MS-DOS
environment. For the example given in the More Information section, you
would copy the .SCX and .SCT files; then choose File, Open on the CUSTOMER
screen to invoke the Transporter and create MS-DOS objects. Once in the
screen tool, make any necessary modifications to the screens. Then choose
Program, Generate from the FoxPro menu to generate MS-DOS-specific code.
Then the transported code can be run on the MS-DOS platform.
<P>
NOTE: If you simply re-generate the code, your screen will NOT be fully
functional. This is because the navigation buttons will be off the screen
when the un-changed screen is brought into FoxPro and then regenerated. You
will have to move things around in order to get all fields and buttons
displayed on one screen.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Demonstrate Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
To use the following information, you must have installed the tutorial
databases in the tutorial directory and have access to the CUSTOMER
database in both FoxPro for MS-DOS and FoxPro for Windows. This
demonstration uses the Screen Wizard, so to follow it, you will need
version 2.6 of both packages.

<OL><P><LI>In the Command Window of FoxPro for Windows, issue these commands:
<P>
   SET DEFAULT TO C:\&lt;FoxPro directory&gt;\TUTORIAL &lt;Enter&gt;
   SELECT 1
   USE CUSTOMER

<P><LI>From the FoxPro menu, select Run, Wizard, Screen.

<P><LI>On screen 1 of 5, the only table that should be selected is CUSTOMER.
   Click the NEXT button.

<P><LI>On screen 2, click the "Add All" button to select all fields from the
   CUSTOMER database. Then click the NEXT button.

<P><LI>On screens 3 and 4, click the NEXT button without selecting anything.

<P><LI>On screen 5, choose the "Save and run screen" radio button. In the Save
   As dialog box, accept the default name of CUSTOMER or type in another
   name. If you choose to type in a different name, modify the following
   directions accordingly. When finished, click the SAVE button.
<P>
   At this point, FoxPro will generate the new screen and run it. When the
   new screen comes up, click the CLOSE button.

<P><LI>Copy the *.SPR file that was just created to the FoxPro for MS-DOS
   tutorial directory (usually, C:\FOXPRO\TUTORIAL). This is important
   because the generated screen will require the use of the Customer table.
   If you do not have the CUSTOMER table in the Tutorial directory, modify
   the previous directions accordingly.

<P><LI>Start FoxPro for MS-DOS. Choose Program, Do from the FoxPro menu. Select
   CUSTOMER.SPR. The SPR will run, however what you will see on the screen
   is blinking text on a solid-colored background. In most instances, this
   will likely be white field names, black field values, and a gray
   background. What will be displayed is shown not in a window but on the
   main FoxPro workspace -- consequently, while the push buttons do
   function correctly, the information displayed can't be sized or moved.
