</PRE><P><LI> Q. An application I have created does not allow me to edit my
<P><PRE>       database files. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Mark your database as "excluded" in the project, then rebuild
       your application. You must distribute these files to your end
       users. Including the database in the project automatically
       marks these files as read-only.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why can't I build an executable file from within my project?
<P><PRE>       The options to do so are dimmed and unavailable.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. To build an executable file, you must purchase the Microsoft
       FoxPro Distribution Kit and install it in your FoxPro
       directory. Prior to installing the FoxPro Distribution Kit,
       make sure that the FoxPro files are not marked as read-only.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. When I attempt to build an executable file, I receive the error
<P><PRE>       message "Link command failed." How can I correct this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. If you receive this error message, check the following items:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - Make sure that you have enough conventional memory.

        - Make sure that you have enough disk space.

        - Increase the number of file handles available to Microsoft
          FoxPro for MS-DOS. To do this, you can increase the FILES
          setting in the CONFIG.SYS file, or increase the FILE HANDLES
          setting in the SHELL.CFG file.

        - Make sure that FoxPro can find your COMMAND.COM file.

        - Make sure that the following files are on your search path:
          WLINK8.EXE, PROAPI16.EXE, and FOXSWAP.COM.

        - If you are running the Extended version of FoxPro, make sure
          that DOSMEM=ON is not on in your CONFIG.FP file.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. My executable file runs correctly under the development
<P><PRE>       version, but I receive the error message "Feature not
       available" under the stand-alone version. How can I correct
       this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. First, check the "Features Not Available" list in the FoxPro
       Distribution Kit documentation. Certain features used for
       development are not available in the applications and
       executables you create. If you still encounter problems, it is
       possible that you are using a macro substitution in your
       program. You must either eliminate the macro substitution or
       include a program that issues the proper command, but is never
       called, in your project.
