<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information below describes Catalog Manager, which is a new tool in
FoxPro version 2.6. This information is also found in FoxPro version 2.6
Help.
<P>
To locate this help file topic, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>If you are using the Windows-style Help file (FOXHELP.HLP), choose
   dBASE Help from the Help menu.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If you are using the .DBF-style Help file (FOXHELP.DBF), go to the
   Catalog Manager topic under the "The FoxPro Interface" section.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The FoxPro Catalog Manager is a graphical interface that enables you to
manage catalogs (.FPC or .CAT files) easily. Catalogs can contain tables,
queries, screens, reports, labels and programs. From this central location,
you can create, modify, and run these FoxPro files. You can also use
AutoMigrate to convert existing dBASE III and dBASE IV files. The Catalog
Manager, written entirely in FoxPro, is an example of the type of
application you can develop in FoxPro.
<P>
Catalog Manager Menus
<PRE>    The Catalog Manager menus are: File, Edit, View, Data, Tools,
    Window, Help.

</PRE>Catalog Manager Window
<PRE>    The Catalog Manager window displays the contents of a catalog and
    allows you to add, create and modify tables, queries, screens,
    reports, labels and programs. You can also use, run or print files
    as applicable. You use the Table, Query, Screen, Report, Label and
    Program tabs to choose the type of files to display in the
    scrollable list.

    When you click on a tab to choose it, that tab becomes the active
    tab. FoxPro displays the files in the current catalog that match
    the active tab, and changes the push buttons to the right of the
    file list so they match the tasks you can accomplish using the
    tab. For example, when you choose the Table tab, FoxPro shows the
    tables (.DBF files) in the current catalog, and displays the Add,
    New, Modify, and Use push buttons. If you select the Screen tab,
    the Use button changes to Run.

    You can also run a file in any tab by double-clicking the file in
    the file list. You can choose a different tab by clicking on it or
    using the View Menu. To view a different catalog, select Open
    Catalog from the File menu.

    Picture buttons located above the tabs provide access to the
    active table, the AutoScreen and AutoReport features, and FoxPro
    Help.

</PRE><h3>Buttons</h3>
 
<P>
Browse - Displays the active table/query in a Browse window. Disabled
when the current catalog contains no tables, or no table is in use.
<P>
AutoScreen - Creates and runs a new screen based on the active
table/query using the Screen Wizard default settings. Disabled when no
table is in use.
<P>
AutoReport - Creates and runs a new report based on the active
table/query using the Report Wizard default settings. Disabled when no
table is in use.
<P>
Help - Opens the FoxPro Help window to the Catalog Manager topic.
Always available.
<P>
Active Table/Query
<PRE>    The Active Table/Query line just above the Catalog Manager tabs
    displays the name of the table or query currently in use. FoxPro
    bases all the new files you create on the active table or query.
    To make a table or query active, choose the appropriate (table or
    query) tab, select the file you want to use, and choose the Use
    button in the Catalog Manager. The table or query name then
    appears in the Active Table/Query line.

</PRE>Description
<PRE>    The Description line just below the file name list box in the
    Catalog Manager displays the file description for the selected
    table, query, screen, report, label or program file. To change the
    description, see the File Description Dialog Help topic.

</PRE>Data Source
<PRE>    When the Screen, Report or Label tab is active, a Data Source line
    displays the source file for the selected screen, report or label
    file. If you want to view the description for the source file,
    select the appropriate (table or query) tab, then select the
    source file in the file list.

</PRE>FoxPro catalogs are single-user files. If you run more than one
concurrent session of FoxPro, each session must have a local copy of
the FOXUSER resource file. You can add table, query, screen, report,
label and program files to more than one catalog.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Catalog</h3>
 
<P>
You can create a new catalog from the File menu.
<P>
To create a catalog from the File menu:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose New Catalog... FoxPro displays the Save
   As dialog.

<P><LI>Type the name of the new catalog file in the Save Catalog As text
   box. Choose Save. The Catalog Manager window appears, displaying an
   empty catalog file.
<P>
</OL>You can then add existing table, query, screen, report, label and
program files to your catalog, or create new files. For more
information on adding files to a catalog, see Editing a Catalog in
this topic.
<P>
<P><h3>Editing a Catalog</h3>
 
<P>
Editing a catalog is different from adding or removing files on your
system. To add a file to a catalog you specify the name of a file that
already exists on your system; FoxPro then adds the file name and file
location to your catalog (.FPC) file. When you remove a file from a
catalog, FoxPro removes the file name and file location from your
catalog file. The actual table, query, screen, report or program file
remains on your system, unless you also choose to delete the file.
<P>
You can add a file to your catalog using a tab or the File menu.
<P>
To add a file to the active catalog using a tab:

<OL><P><LI>Select the tab representing the type of file (table, query, screen,
   report, label, or program) you want to add to your catalog.

<P><LI>Choose the Add push button. FoxPro displays the Open dialog.
<P>

<P><LI>Select the file you want to add to the catalog from the list of
   filenames. Use the Drives and Directories list to locate the file
   if it's not in the current directory.

<P><LI>Choose Add. FoxPro adds the name and location of the selected file
   to the active catalog (.FPC file) and displays the filename in the
   file list for the selected tab.
<P>
</OL>To add a file to your catalog using the File menu:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Add File... to display a cascading menu
   of the types of files you can add to a catalog.

<P><LI>Select the file type for the file you want to add and click or
   press Enter to display the Open Dialog.

<P><LI>In the Open dialog, double-click on the file you want to add to the
   catalog.
<P>
</OL>You can remove a file from your catalog using the Delete key or the
File menu.
<P>
To remove a file from the active catalog

<UL><LI>Select the file in the file list, then press the Delete key, or
   choose Remove File... from the File menu. FoxPro displays the
   Remove File dialog.
<P>
</UL>Switching Between the Catalog Manager and FoxPro
 
<P>
You can switch between the Catalog Manager and FoxPro at any time.
<P>
To switch from the Catalog Manager to the FoxPro menu system and
Command window:

<UL><LI>From the File menu, choose Command Window. The Catalog Manager
   closes and FoxPro displays the main FoxPro window and Command
   window.
<P>
</UL>To switch from the FoxPro menu system and Command window to the
Catalog Manager:

<UL><LI>From the File menu, choose Catalog Manager... The Catalog Manager
   opens, displaying the last catalog used. If there is no catalog to
   open, a dialog prompts you to open an existing catalog or create a
   new one.
<P>
</UL><h3>Opening an Existing Catalog</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro opens the last opened catalog when you choose the option
Proceed to the Catalog Manager from the Introductory Screen. If it is
not possible to determine the last opened catalog, FoxPro displays the
Open dialog.
<P>
Once in the Catalog Manager, you can also open a different existing
catalog (dBASE .CAT file, or FoxPro .FPC file) from the File menu.
<P>
To open a catalog from the Catalog Manager:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open Catalog.... FoxPro displays the
   Open dialog.

<P><LI>Select the catalog you want to open from the list of files.

<P><LI>Choose Open.
<P>
</OL><h3>Removing a Catalog</h3>
 
<P>
You remove a catalog by deleting the catalog files from your system.
FoxPro catalogs consist of two associated files. The catalog file has
the extension .FPC; the associated memo file has the same name as the
catalog, with an .FCT extension. dBASE catalogs have the file
extension .CAT.
<P>
Deleting catalog (.FPC and .FCT, or .CAT) files from your system does
not affect the table, query, screen, report, label and program files
referenced within the catalog. The referenced files remain on your
system until you choose to remove them.
<P>
If you want to remove from your system both the files referenced in a
catalog and the catalog itself, first edit the catalog to remove the
file references. Check the Delete File from Disk check box in the
Remove File dialog to delete the actual files. You can then remove the
catalog file from your system. For more information about editing a
catalog, see the Editing a Catalog topic.
<P>
<P><h3>Exiting the Catalog Manager</h3>
 
<P>
When you exit the Catalog Manager you can choose to work in the main
FoxPro window or to quit FoxPro.
<P>
To work in the main FoxPro window:

<UL><LI>From the File menu, choose Command Window. The Catalog Manager
   closes and FoxPro displays the main FoxPro window and Command
   window.
<P>
</UL>To quit FoxPro

<UL><LI>From the File menu, choose Quit. The Catalog Manager closes and
   FoxPro closes.
<P>
</UL><h3>Configuring the Catalog Manager</h3>
 
<P>
The Introductory Screen is displayed by default when you enter FoxPro.
If you do not want to display the Introductory Screen each time you
start FoxPro, you can check the Don't display this Introductory Screen
again check box.
<P>
If you've checked this check box in the past and want to see the
Introductory Screen again, or if you want to start the Catalog Manager
automatically when you enter FoxPro, edit your CONFIG.FPW file. To
display the introductory screen again, remove the CATMAN=ON/OFF entry.
<P>
If each time you enter FoxPro you want to display the Introductory
Screen, edit CONFIG.FPW to include [no CATMAN entry].
<P>
If each time you enter FoxPro you want to suppress display of the
Introductory Screen and enter Catalog Manager, edit CONFIG.FPW to
include CATMAN=ON.
<P>
If each time you enter FoxPro you want to suppress display of the
Introductory Screen, bypass the Catalog Manager and display the FoxPro
Command window, edit CONFIG.FPW to include CATMAN=OFF.
