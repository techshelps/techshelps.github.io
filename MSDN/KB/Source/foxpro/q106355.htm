The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, and 2.5b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With the introduction of Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, new
integrated faxing capabilities are available to Windows-based applications.
FoxPro for Windows can access these fax features, which are referred to as
Microsoft At Work PC Fax.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro for Windows can fax information as editable files, or as a standard
fax printout. The capabilities are limited by the hardware and software
installed at each end of the fax connection.
<P>
Fax machines are grouped in software categories by group number, and in
hardware categories by class number.
<P>
Faxing Printouts
 
<P>
To use At Work PC Fax for transmitting standard fax printouts through
FoxPro for Windows, the following system requirements must be met:

<OL><P><LI>Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 and FoxPro for Windows version 2.5
   or later must be installed.

<P><LI>The computer used to perform faxing must have a fax modem installed. The
   fax modem must be Group 3, Class 1, 2, or 3, or the computer must have
   access to a shared fax modem on the Windows for Workgroups network.

<P><LI>The Microsoft At Work PC Fax driver must be installed as a printer
   driver.

<P><LI>In order to fax a text file, the At Work PC Fax printer driver must be
   selected, for example, as the specific printer in the Page Layout dialog
   box for a specific report.

<P><LI>The station receiving the fax must be either a Group 3 fax, or a
   computer with a Group 3 fax modem installed. The other computer does not
   need to be running Windows for Workgroups version 3.11.
<P>
</OL><h3>Faxing Files</h3>
 
<P>
In order to fax files, the following additional requirements must be met:

<OL><P><LI>The sending and receiving workstations must both be running Windows for
   Workgroups version 3.11 and Microsoft Mail, with the At Work PC Fax
   driver installed.

<P><LI>Both workstations must have access to a Group 3, Class 1 fax modem
   board.

<P><LI>The receiving workstation must have a valid mail user account set up.
   The fax must be addressed to this user account. The file will be
   received as a mail attachment, which is saved through normal Mail menu
   choices.

<P><LI>The sending workstation uses MAPI.DLL to send a mail message. The "TO"
   parameter of the mail message includes the user account name  and phone
   number, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>       "ANYONE @555-5555"
