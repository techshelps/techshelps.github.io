The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c, and 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When building distribution disks using the Setup Wizard (SETUP.APP) for
an application or executable file created with the FoxPro for Macintosh
Distribution Kit, the disk images may be too large to actually fit onto a
floppy disk. This can occur with either the 800 kilobyte (K) or 1.44
megabyte (MB) floppy disk sizes.
<P>
NOTE: FoxPro 2.6a does not have the option to create 800K disk images. It
can only create 1.44 MB disk images.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Large numbers of small files have been known to cause this. The problem may
be hard to reproduce unless a certain combination of files is used.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The following modifications to SETUP.APP may correct this problem.
<P>
NOTE: These modifications are undergoing further testing and may not work
in all situations.
<P>
Modifications of the FoxPro SETUP.PJX file (Setup Wizard) are not supported
by the FoxPro Microsoft Technical Support team; however, this file can be
modified as it is a normal FoxPro Project and Application. The information
provided here should be used only by experienced programmers who need to
get around the problem described in this article.

<OL><P><LI>Open the Setup project located in the DK Wizard folder installed by the
   FoxPro for Macintosh Distribution Kit by using this code:
<P>
   MODIFY PROJECT SYS(2004)+"DK Wizard:Setup"

<P><LI>From the Project Manager, edit the T_Disks table. Change the entries in
   the Disksize field to smaller values. The original value for the 1.44
   megabyte disks is 1427050. 800952 for the 800 kilobyte disks. Using
   1375000 for the 1.44 megabyte disks has been known to fix the problem
   for that size. Some experimentation may be necessary to find a size that
   allows for an optimal amount of information to be placed on the disk.

<P><LI>Save the changes to the T_Disks table, close it, and rebuild the
   application. Remember to replace the version of the application
   that is located in the FoxPro folder, not just the version in the
   DK Wizard folder.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
