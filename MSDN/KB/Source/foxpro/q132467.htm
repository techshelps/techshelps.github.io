The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes and demonstrates the firing order of rules and
triggers depending on whether buffering is on or off. Further, with
buffering on, the article demonstrates the firing order differences
depending the buffering level.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Row rules are there to protect the integrity of a record. Column rules
protect the integrity of a field (column). The order in which the rules
and triggers fire depends directly on the buffering in effect at that
time.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Set Up the Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>To duplicate the behavior of the Firing Order of Rules and Trigger,
   create the sample database container and table with the specified Stored
   Procedures. Enter the following in the Command window:
<P>
<PRE>   CREATE DATABASE Mydata              &amp;&amp; Creates the database container
   MODIFY DATABASE Mydata              &amp;&amp; Opens the database container

</PRE><P><LI>Enter the following Procedures into the Store Procedures:
<P>
   PROCEDURE MYCOL
   =MESSAGEBOX("My Column Rule")
<P>
   PROCEDURE MYROW
   =MESSAGEBOX("My Row Rule")
<P>
   PROCEDURE MYINS
   =MESSAGEBOX("My Insert Trigger")
<P>
   PROCEDURE MYDEL
   =MESSAGEBOX("My Delete Trigger")
<P>
   PROCEDURE MYUPD
   =MESSAGEBOX("My Update Trigger")

<P><LI>Enter the following in the Command window:
<P>
   CREATE TABLE Mytab(Fname C(15),Lname C(15) UNIQUE CHECK Mycol(), ;
<P><PRE>      MI C(2),CHECK Myrow())
</PRE><P>
   CREATE TRIGGER ON Mytab FOR UPDATE AS Myupd()
   CREATE TRIGGER ON Mytab FOR INSERT AS Myins()
   CREATE TRIGGER ON Mytab FOR DELETE AS Mydel()
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Demonstrate Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the Command window, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      OPEN DATABASE Mydata
<PRE></PRE>      SET MULTILOCKS ON               &amp;&amp; Required for buffering.
      =CURSORSETPROP("Buffering",1)   &amp;&amp; Turns Buffering Off

   Or on the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Data tab and
   set buffering to Off.

   To verify that buffering is Off, enter the following on a new line in
   the Command window:

      ? CURSORGETPROP("Buffering")

   This returns the value of the Buffering level:

      1=OFF
      2=RECORD(PESSIMISTIC)
      3=RECORD(OPTIMISTIC)
      4=TABLE(PESSIMISTIC)
      5=TABLE(OPTIMISTIC)

</PRE><P><LI>Highlight the title bar of the table. Then using the right mouse button,
   click, and select BROWSE.

<P><LI>With table buffering Off, press CTRL+Y to append a blank record. Notice
   that the COLUMN, ROW, UNIQUE check, and INSERT rules fired in order
   for the new record.
<P>
   When you press CTRL+Y again, notice that the ROW rule and the UPDATE
   trigger fire as you leave the first record. Then you once again see the
   COLUMN, ROW, UNIQUE check, and INSERT rules fired for the new record.

<P><LI>Press the UP ARROW key to move off the current record just entered.
   Notice the ROW, UNIQUE check, and UPDATE rules fire as you leave that
   record.

<P><LI>Mark any record(s) for deletion as necessary. The DELETE trigger
   fires. Then undelete the records. Notice the firing order of the rules
   are the same as they are a new record: COLUMN, ROW, UNIQUE check, and
   INSERT.
<P>
   As you enter a value or change the value of a LNAME, you will see the
   "My Column Rule" message box. The firing order was COLUMN RULE, ROW
   RULE, UNIQUE check, UPDATE TRIGGER.

<P><LI>Change Buffering to 2 (Pessimistic Record Locks) by typing the following
   in the Command window:
<P>
<PRE>      SET MULTILOCKS ON        &amp;&amp; If you have not done so previously.
      =CURSORSETPROP("Buffering",2)

   Or on the Tools menu, click options. Then click the Data tab and set
   buffering to Record(Pessimistic).

   Again, press CTRL+Y to append a blank record, and notice that nothing
   fires. Enter some data. Note COLUMN(S) RULE fires. Leave the
   record by pressing the UP ARROW. Now, the ROW, UNIQUE check, and INSERT
   Rules fire in order as you leave the record.

   If you mark a record for deletion, the DELETE rule fires. If you
   undelete a record, the rules fire as before depending on the
   buffering level you set.

   Notice the same behavior occurs for Buffering Level 3,
   Record(Optimistic).

</PRE><P><LI>Change Buffering to 4 (Pessimistic Table Locks) by typing the following
   in the Command window:
<P>
<PRE>      SET MULTILOCKS ON          &amp;&amp; If you have not done so previously.
      =CURSORSETPROP("Buffering",4)   &amp;&amp; Table(Pessimistic)

   Or on the Tools menu, click options. Then click the Data tab and set
   buffering to Table(Pessimistic)

   Then follow these steps:

   a. Press CTRL+Y to append a blank record, and notice that no rules
      fire for the new record. Enter some data.

   b. Press CTRL+Y to append a blank record, and notice that the ROW
      rule fires for the first record. It did not fire for record 2, the
      new empty record.

   c. Press the UP ARROW key to leave record 2. Notice that the ROW rule
      fires for record 2 that you are leaving. It did not fire for record
      1, the record you went to. This would also be true if you were
      editing record 5 in a set of 12. If you leave the record by pressing
      the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW key, the ROW rule fires for the record you
      left, not the one you went to. This only happens for new and modified
      records.

</PRE><P><LI>Mark record(s) for deletion. There is no problem here, but note that
   buffering must be turned off before you pack the table or remove the
   deleted records. To pack, type the following in the Command window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =TABLEUPDATE(.t.)
</PRE><P>
   You will see the DELETE trigger(s) fire as the table is updated from the
   buffer. You will see the same behavior for buffering level 5. To close
   the table, use TABLEUPDATE(.t.).

<P><LI>Change buffering to 1 (Off) by typing the following in Command window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =CURSORSETPROP("Buffering",1)
</PRE><P>
   Or on the Tools menu, click options. Then click the Data tab and set
   buffering to OFF
<P>
   When finished, you can pack or recycle the records.
