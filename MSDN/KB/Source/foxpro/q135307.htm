<PRE>CONTROLS.APP         X     X    Allows you to look at examples of object-
                                oriented code and then run them to see how
                                the resulting objects work. Shows examples
                                of new controls available, such as timers,
                                grids, tabbed dialogs, and so on, and it
                                demonstrates how to use familiar objects in

                                particular feature was implemented, while
                                the Case Study provides a summary of the
                                design and implementation methodology used.

Sample Client-Server       X    Provides an example of an application

                                handlng errors. Run Main.prg in the
                                \Samples\Csapp subdirectory to connect to
                                the SQL Server sample database "Pubs" by
