The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0 and 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a form contains a combo box that has its RowSource set to the same
table that other controls on the form are using as their ControlSource, the
record pointer may move to a different record when the user activates the
combo box. There are two different scenarios where this unwanted moving of
the record pointer can occur. This article outlines both scenarios.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use an SQL statement for the RowSource of the combo box.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are not familiar with the Form Designer or with the different form
controls, please see Chapters 9 and 11 in the Developer's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new form and add the Customer table (found in the Samples\Data
   directory) to the form's Data Environment.

<P><LI>Drag the cust_id and company fields from the Customer table in the Data
   Environment onto the form.

<P><LI>Add a combo box (Combo1) to the form and set these properties:
<P>
   RowSourceType = 6 - Fields
   RowSource = Customer.Cust_id

<P><LI>Add the following code to the following indicated Combo1 events:
<P>
   Init event:
<P>
<P><PRE>      This.Value = Cust_id
</PRE><P>
   GotFocus event:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SET ORDER TO Cust_id
</PRE><P>
   InteractiveChage event:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ThisForm.Combo2.Value = This.Value
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add a second combo box (Combo2) to the form and set these properties:
<P>
   RowSourceType = 6 - Fields
   RowSource = Customer.Company,Cust_id
   BoundColumn = 2
   ColumnCount = 2
   ColumnWidths = 200,0

<P><LI>Add the following code to the following indicated Combo2 events:
<P>
   Init Event:
<P>
<P><PRE>      This.Value = Cust_id
</PRE><P>
   GotFocus Event:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SET ORDER TO Company
</PRE><P>
   InteractiveChage Event:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ThisForm.Combo1.Value = This.Value
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save and run the form.

<P><LI>After the form is up and running, click Debug on the Tools Menu. In the
   Debug window, enter RECNO().
<P>
</OL><h3>Scenario Number One</h3>
 
<P>
Activate the drop down list in Combo1, and select BERGS. Look in the Debug
window to see what record number you are on. Then click in the text area of
Combo2 to place your mouse pointer in it. Look in the Debug window, and you
will see that the record number has changed. Now place your mouse pointer
back in Combo1, and you will see in the Debug window that the record number
has moved back to what it was when you first made the selection in Combo1.
<P>
<P><h3>Scenario Number Two</h3>
 
<P>
Activate the drop down list in Combo1, and move your mouse pointer down the
list until the last item in the visible list is highlighted. Without making
a selection, click in one of the text boxes on the form. Look in the Debug
Window, and you will see that the record pointer has moved. In both
scenarios, if you were to activate one of the text boxes, you would see the
value of the text box change to match what is stored in the record.
