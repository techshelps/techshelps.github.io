The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5 and 2.5a
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can create applications and programs that can be executed by all
FoxPro products; for example, you can create a screen in FoxPro for
MS-DOS that can be executed in FoxPro for Windows. Below are some
special considerations for these cross-platform applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In order to run a FoxPro application on a different platform, you must
purchase the development version for that platform. For example, an
application developed in FoxPro for MS-DOS cannot be run in FoxPro for
Windows unless you first purchase the development version of FoxPro
for Windows in order to run the program. When you are creating and
distributing .FXP, .APP, and .EXE files, you must purchase both the
development version and the Distribution Kit for every platform the
application will be run on.
<P>
If an API library (an external library, created using Microsoft C/C++
version 7.0 or later or WATCOM C compiler 8.5 or later) is used, only
one copy of the FoxPro Library Construction Kit is needed; however,
the library should be compiled into both a .PLB (MS-DOS-style library)
and an .FLL (Windows-style library). Likewise, only one copy of the
FoxPro Connectivity Kit is needed for both the MS-DOS and Windows
products.
<P>
Due to the differences inherent in various platforms, some commands
are not available on all platforms. For example, the Windows version
of FoxPro can take advantage of various fonts and can place objects
according to precise pixel locations, but this is not possible in the
MS-DOS version. For screens to be ideally transferable, this
difference must be taken into consideration. It is therefore
advantageous to double-check if a command is valid on any other
platforms the application may eventually be run on.
<P>
The system variables _DOS, _WINDOWS, _MACINTOSH, and _UNIX are
designed to provide a programmatic method of customizing code specific
to a platform. By using an IF ... ENDIF or DO CASE ... ENDCASE
structure, a portion of code can be written in a platform-specific
manner, while the majority of code applies to all platforms.
<P>
Although source code is applicable to all platforms, the object
(compiled) code may not be. Therefore, it is best to recompile a
program before running it on another platform. When you are dealing
with the FoxPro generators (the Screen Builder, Report Writer, and
Label Designer), remember that not all changes are automatically
reflected on a different platform. To view the changes, transport the
file before executing it.
