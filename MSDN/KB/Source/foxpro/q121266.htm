<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Can I create a FoxPro for Windows application using FoxPro for MS-DOS?

<P><LI>I have an existing FoxPro 2.0 project. How do I enable it to run in
   FoxPro version 2.6?

<P><LI>Will I be able to create executable files for FoxPro version 2.6?

<P><LI>Why doesn't my Low Level File I/O program work in the Windows Product?
<P>
</OL><h3>Question 1</h3>
 
<P>
Can I create a FoxPro for Windows application using FoxPro for MS-DOS?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 1</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro for Windows can execute applications you create with FoxPro for
MS-DOS without you making any changes to the appplications. The FoxPro for
MS-DOS power tools, however, don't support features that are specific to
the Windows environment. You can write your own code to add these Windows
features, but we don't recommend this approach to cross-platform
application development.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 2</h3>
 
<P>
I have an existing FoxPro 2.0 project. How do I enable it to run in FoxPro
version 2.6?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 2</h3>
 
<P>
You open the project in FoxPro version 2.6 and rebuild your application.
You must convert screens and reports only if you decide to modify them.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 3</h3>
 
<P>
Will I be able to create executable files for FoxPro version 2.6?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 3</h3>
 
<P>
Yes. The options for building .EXE files in FoxPro 2.6 for MS-DOS are the
same as in FoxPro 2.0. You can build compact and stand-alone .EXE files.
Compact .EXE files are distributed with library files that are included in
the FoxPro Distribution Kit. Stand-alone .EXE files don't require the
FoxPro library files. The information from the libraries is built into a
stand-alone .EXE.
<P>
In FoxPro for Windows, you can create the equivalent of the compact .EXE
file. These files are distributed with the library files included in the
FoxPro for Windows Distribution Kit.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 4</h3>
 
<P>
Why doesn't my Low Level File I/O program work in the Windows Product?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 4</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro for Windows can not access the COM ports with the Low Level File
commands.
<P>
This is documented if you look at the FOPEN() command, but many people who
are accustomed to opening a port in the MS-DOS product would test this
function and think it is broken.
<P>
This is not a bug - it is product design. In the Windows multi-tasking
environment, other applications besides FoxPro may also be using the COM
ports. It is not desirable to allow a Windows-based application to take
exclusive control of the communications port.
<P>
Access to the COM port would be provided through FoxTools.FLL and the
Windows API calls. In the FPW26\goodies\foxtools directory is a file called
dialer.prg This shows an example of using the com port under the Windows
environment.
<P>
The use of the REGFN() and CALLFN() are documented in the FOXTOOLS.WRI file
in the same directory as the example.
<P>
Refer to the Windows SDK documentation for information on specific API
calls.

</OL><h3>Question 1</h3>
 
<P>
Why do the windows created in FoxPro for Windows have different style
controls when compared with the windows in FoxPro for MS-DOS?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 1</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro for Windows is designed to conform to the Windows version 3.1
interface guidelines for applications. These guidelines enable you to use
the same methods of moving, selecting, and changing windows with all
Windows-based applications. FoxPro windows now include Control-menu boxes
and Minimize, Maximize, and Restore buttons. For a complete discussion of
window styles and terminology, refer to the Getting Started manual.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 2</h3>
 
<P>
What is the purpose of the Control-menu box at the top left of FoxPro
windows?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 2</h3>
 
<P>
A single click in the Control-menu box displays the Control menu, with
which you can move, size, close, and select windows. A double-click in the
Control-menu box closes the window.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 3</h3>
 
<P>
Why is it that I can resize some windows in FoxPro and not others?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 3</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro for Windows contains windows you can size and windows you can't
size. Windows that contain a text-editing region are sizable. Examples of
sizable windows are the Command window, Screen Design window, and the
Calendar. These windows may contain scroll bars and a sizing box in the
bottom right corner of the window. Examples of windows you can't size
include the View and RQBE windows. Windows you can't size have only the
Control-menu box and the Minimize button.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 4</h3>
 
<P>
Why have the keyboard shortcuts in FoxPro for Windows changed? Is there a
way to restore the FoxPro for MS-DOS style keystrokes?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 4</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro for Windows supports Windows-style keystrokes, such as using ENTER
to choose a focused selection. FoxPro for Windows supports both an MS-DOS
keystroke mode and Windows keystroke mode. Refer to the FoxPro online help
for details on the keystroke differences. You were asked at installation
time which mode to select. However, you can change the mode interactively
at any time in FoxPro by issuing the command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET KEYCOMP TO DOS

   -or-

   SET KEYCOMP TO WINDOWS

</PRE></OL>Each time you load FoxPro, the default KEYCOMP setting you specify during
installation will be in effect. To change the default setting of KEYCOMP,
include the appropriate statement the CONFIG.FPW file:
<P>
<PRE>   KEYCOMP=DOS

   -or-

   KEYCOMP=WINDOWS

</PRE><h3>Question 5</h3>
 
<P>
When I create a table and press ENTER to add a new field, I find that the
dialog unexpectedly closes. Why is this?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 5</h3>
 
<P>
The keystroke navigation is different in Windows and MS-DOS. In FoxPro for
MS-DOS, the keystroke equivalent of clicking the focus button is
CTRL+ENTER. In Windows, it is ENTER. So pressing ENTER in the Table
Structure dialog tells FoxPro you chose the OK button. To establish the
MS-DOS keystroke mode in Windows, issue the command SET KEYCOMP TO DOS.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 6</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro for Windows automatically displays a status bar located at the
bottom of the main window. Is it possible to remove this status bar? Is the
MS-DOS style status bar available?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 6</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows-style status bar displays the same information as the MS-DOS
style status bar, plus information about the currently selected menu name
or command and messages you create using FoxPro commands. It can also
display the system time.
<P>
The Windows-style status bar is displayed by default. To remove the status
bar, in the Command window issue this command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET STATUS BAR OFF

</PRE>Alternatively, in CONFIG.FPW enter this item:
<P>
<PRE>   STATUS BAR = OFF

</PRE>To restore the status bar, substitute ON for OFF in the previous two
examples.
<P>
The SET MESSAGE TO command you use to specify a message location is ignored
when the Windows style status bar is active. When the Windows-style status
bar is active, messages you create with commands such as DEFINE MENU,
DEFINE POPUP, DEFINE BAR, and @...PROMPT appear in the Windows-style status
bar.
<P>
When the Windows-style status bar is active, to display the time on the
right hand side of the status bar issue this command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET CLOCK STATUS

</PRE>Alternatively, in CONFIG.FPW enter this item:
<P>
<PRE>   CLOCK = STATUS

</PRE>For compatibility with existing FoxPro version 2.0 applications, FoxPro for
Windows displays the MS-DOS style status bar when you issue the command SET
STATUS ON.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 7</h3>
 
<P>
In FoxPro for Windows, when I issue the command SET DISPLAY TO VGA50 and
then issue the command SET DISPLAY TO VGA25 to restore the previous
setting, the status bar disappears. How do I restore the status bar?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 7</h3>
 
<P>
Issue the SET STATUS BAR ON command.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 8</h3>
 
<P>
Why has the menu for FoxPro for Windows changed? Is the MS-DOS version of
the menu available?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 8</h3>
 
<P>
The menu in FoxPro for Windows has been modified for consistency with the
standard Windows interface. The System menu on the FoxPro version 2.0 menu
bar has been removed and a number of specific menu items have been moved.
<P>
Take a moment to explore the new menu structure. Note that a brief message
describing each menu item is displayed in the status bar at the bottom of
the main FoxPro window.
<P>
If you are more comfortable with the menu bar layout of FoxPro version 2.0,
you can run a distributed FoxPro menu program that recreates it. Generate
the menu first, and then execute the DOS.MPR file located in the GOODIES
subdirectory with the DO command. Running this menu program replaces the
FoxPro for Windows menu bar layout with the FoxPro for MS-DOS menu bar
layout while retaining the Text menu for multiple font support.
<P>
To automatically display the FoxPro for MS-DOS menu bar when you load
FoxPro for Windows, place the following item in the CONFIG.FPW file to
execute the DOS.MPR program:
<P>
<PRE>   COMMAND = DO C:\FPW26\GOODIES\DOS\DOS.MPR

</PRE>Modify the path specification for DOS.MPR based on your specific
installation.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 9</h3>
 
<P>
The Edit menu contains a number of new options such as Paste Special... and
Change Link... . How do I use these options?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 9</h3>
 
<P>
The new Edit menu options support Object Linking and Embedding (OLE). The
items include Paste Special, Insert Object, Object, Change Link, and
Convert to Static. For a detailed discussion of OLE consult the FoxPro
documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 10</h3>
 
<P>
The Program menu contains the new option, Beautify. What does it do?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 10</h3>
 
<P>
The Beautify option alters the appearance of program files so they are
easier to read. For example, you can choose to alter the case of key words
and variables and to add indentation within procedures and DO CASE
statements. You can also highlight program organization by bracketing
specific control statements such as:
<P>
<PRE>   IF
      DO something
   ELSE
      DO something
   ENDIF

</PRE><h3>Question 11</h3>
 
<P>
The Text menu is completely new. What new features does this menu offer?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 11</h3>
 
<P>
The Text Menu adds support for multiple fonts and text formatting. The Font
option makes all of your installed Windows fonts available within FoxPro. A
Font option is also available in the Browse menu for Browse windows.
<P>
To change the main FoxPro window font, hold down the SHIFT key when you
choose the Text menu pad. Then choose the Screen Font... option.
<P>
The Enlarge Font and Reduce Font options change all text to the next
available point size in the current font. To alter the spacing of the text,
select the Single Space, 1 1/2 Space, or Double Space option.
<P>
The Indent option indents the selected group of lines one tab stop. Undent
does the opposite by moving a selected group of lines out one tab stop.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 12</h3>
 
<P>
Occasionally the Object menu is available. When does it display and why?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 12</h3>
 
<P>
The Object menu is available when either the Screen Builder or the Report
Writer window is open. As with the Text and Browse menus, the Object menu
provides access to fonts. Specific items on the Object menu are enabled and
disabled based on the currently selected object.
<P>
For example, a rectangle drawn in the Screen Design window may have an
outline or pen color, a background or fill color, and a fill pattern.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 13</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro for Windows includes Windows-style help. Is there any way to access
the .DBF-style help I used in Fox version 2.0?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 13</h3>
 
<P>
By default, FoxPro for Windows uses Windows-style help. To access the
.DBF-style help, issue this command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET HELP TO FOXHELP.DBF

</PRE>Pressing the F1 key or choosing Contents from the menu will then open
.DBF-style help.
<P>
To return to the Windows-style help, issue this command:
<P>
<PRE>   SET HELP TO FOXHELP.HLP

</PRE>To change the default help to the .DBF-style help, add the following
statement to your CONFIG.FPW file:
<P>
<PRE>   HELP = FOXHELP.DBF

</PRE><h3>Question 14</h3>
 
<P>
Shouldn't a full path rather than just the drive letter display when I
issue the following command in the Command window?
<P>
<PRE>   ? SET("DEFAULT")

</PRE><h3>Answer 14</h3>
 
<P>
No. This is consistent with FoxPro version 2.0 for MS-DOS. Use CURDIR() to
display the path for the current directory.
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 3: Report Writer</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Should I convert all of my FoxPro version 2.0 reports to FoxPro for
   Windows format?

<P><LI>I used the Quick Report option to create my initial report. Now I want
   to add another field. In FoxPro for MS-DOS, the Report menu popup
   contained an option called Field... that allowed me to add a single
   field. What do I do in FoxPro for Windows?

<P><LI>I have included a memo-type field in my report but only the first line
   prints. How can I fix this?

<P><LI>When I place a "stretched" memo field in the detail band, I find that

   longer memo fields. How do I avoid this?

<P><LI>I have placed boxes around several fields in my report. One of these
   fields is a memo field. How do I make the box stretch to fit the memo
   field?

<P><LI>When I attempt to move a text object to a specific location in the
   Report Design window, the field keeps aligning itself with the nearest
   grid line. Why is this happening?

<P><LI>How do I design and print multi-column reports in FoxPro version 2.6 for
   Windows?

<P><LI>When I enlarge the font of objects in my report and print it, some of
   the information in the fields is obscured. How can I fix this?
<P>
</OL><h3>Question 1</h3>
 
<P>
Should I convert all of my FoxPro version 2.0 reports to FoxPro for Windows
format?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 1</h3>
 
<P>
You may not need to. Your existing character reports will run, preview, and
print unchanged in FoxPro for Windows. The engine for printing character
reports is included in FoxPro for Windows. If you want to include graphical
elements such as fonts and pictures in a report, then you can convert the
reports to FoxPro for Windows format, or create new graphical reports from
scratch.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 2</h3>
 
<P>
I used the Quick Report option to create my initial report. Now I want to
add another field. In FoxPro for MS-DOS, the Report menu contained an
option called Field... that allowed me to add a single field. What do I do
in FoxPro for Windows?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 2</h3>
 
<P>
You can add new fields by using the field tool located in the toolbox on
the left side of the Report Design window. See the FoxPro for Windows
User's Guide for additional information on the Report Writer toolbox.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 3</h3>
 
<P>
I have included a memo-type field in my report but only the first line
prints. How can I fix this?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 3</h3>
 
<P>
To display the entire contents of the memo field, you must make the field
stretch vertically to fit its contents. Double-click the report field and
select the Top - Field Can Stretch option from the Position Relative To
item. This field will now enlarge depending on the length of the memo field
contents. Select the Page Preview option to view the result.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 4</h3>
 
<P>
When I place a "stretched" memo field in the detail band, I find that the
fields that display below the memo field are overwritten by some of the
longer memo fields. How do I avoid this?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 4</h3>
 
<P>
Fields or objects positioned below the memo field are still being displayed
in a fixed position even though the memo field is now stretchable. To avoid
being overwritten, all objects below the memo field should be positioned
relative to the bottom of the Detail band. To accomplish this, double-click
each of the fields and select the Bottom option from the Position Relative
To item. Select the Page Preview option to view the result. If your report
contains side-by-side memo fields, fields with the Bottom option specified
will display below the longer of the two memo fields.
<P>
NOTE: The previous procedure applies to non-stretching fields and other
objects, such as lines and text. If you have stretching fields placed below
other stretching fields, you don't want to position them "relative to
bottom." Stretching fields automatically float below other stretching
fields.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 5</h3>
 
<P>
I have placed boxes around several fields in my report. One of these fields
is a memo field. How do I make the box stretch to fit the memo field?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 5</h3>
 
<P>
Double-click the box and select the Stretch With Band option from the
Position Relative To item. Rectangles (boxes) and vertical lines can
optionally stretch according to the length of the Detail band.
<P>
NOTE: You won't be able to place a stretching box around a field if the
field won't be positioned relative to the top or the bottom of the band.
Boxes must be positioned relative to the top or bottom of the band.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 6</h3>
 
<P>
When I attempt to move a text object to a specific location in the Report
Design window, the field keeps aligning itself with the nearest grid line.
Why is this happening?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 6</h3>
 
<P>
By default, objects are automatically aligned to the nearest invisible grid
lines within the Report Design window. This feature is called Snap to Grid
and may be disabled by deselecting the Snap to Grid option from the Report
menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 7</h3>
 
<P>
How do I design and print multi-column reports in FoxPro version 2.6 for
Windows?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 7</h3>
 
<P>
Select Page Layout... from the Report menu option and use the Columns
spinner to select the number of columns. Clicking the up arrow increases
the counter value, and clicking the down arrow decreases the counter value.
The size of the Report Design window reflects the new column width, and you
may need to modify existing field positions.
<P>
HINT: When creating a new report that will have columns, set the layout
before you add any fields.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 8</h3>
 
<P>
When I enlarge the font of objects in my report and print the report, some
of the information in the fields is obscured. How can I fix this?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 8</h3>
 
<P>
You may need to stretch the detail lines or the objects themselves to
accommodate the larger font.
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 4: Screen Builder</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>I don't own a mouse. How can I create a screen using the keyboard?

<P><LI>The Field dialog in the Screen Design window allows me to create only an
   input field or an output field. What happened to the Edit field option
   in the field dialog?

<P><LI>When I select the push button tool in the Screen Design window I have a
   choice of three button types: Normal, Invisible, and Picture. Were these
   types available in FoxPro version 2.0?

<P><LI>I know how to click and drag objects within the Screen Design window
   using the Selection pointer tool. Is there an easy way to move objects a
   small distance?

<P><LI>I created a screen for my application to display a number of fields.
   After creating the application, when I move the cursor from one field to
   the next, the order in which the cursor moves to the fields isn't what I

   the field access order without changing the physical position of the
   fields?

<P><LI>When generating screens in FoxPro version 2.0, I was able to specify
   exactly what code to generate. Options included adding code to open and

</PRE>
<P><LI>I developed a screen in 1024x768 resolution and it does not appear
<P><PRE>    consistent with lower resolutions such as 640x480. How can I develop a

</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Question 1</h3>
 
<P>
I don't own a mouse. How can I create a screen using the keyboard?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 1</h3>
 
<P>
A mouse is required to create a screen with the Screen Builder.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 2</h3>
 
<P>
The Field dialog in the Screen Design window allows me to create only an
input field or an output field. What happened to the Edit field option in
the field dialog?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 2</h3>
 
<P>
The Edit field option is now part of the new Edit Region dialog. To create
an edit field, click the edit region tool located on the left side of the
Screen Design window. Notice that as you select the tool a brief
description appears in the status bar at the bottom of the screen. In the
Edit Region dialog the options Select on Entry and Initially Disable Edit
Region are new. For additional information on these options, see the Edit
Region Dialog topic in Help.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 3</h3>
 
<P>
When I select the push button tool in the Screen Design window, I have a
choice of three button types: Normal, Invisible, and Picture. Were these
types available in FoxPro version 2.0?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 3</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro for Windows has consolidated the Invisible Button and Push Button
options into a single dialog. The Picture type push button is new. You can
create a picture push button using a bitmap (.BMP) picture file to depict
graphically the action the push button represents. You can also use picture
files with radio buttons and check boxes in FoxPro for Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 4</h3>
 
<P>
I know how to click and drag objects within the Screen Design window using
the Selection pointer tool. Is there an easy way to move objects a small
distance?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 4</h3>
 
<P>
Yes. Select the object to move using the Selection pointer tool and use the
arrow keys to move the object one pixel at a time.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 5</h3>
 
<P>
I created a screen for my application to display a number of fields. After
creating the application, when I move the cursor from one field to the
next, the order in which the cursor moves to the fields isn't what I expect
based on the physical arrangement of the fields. How can I change the field
access order without changing the physical position of the fields?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 5</h3>
 
<P>
Return to your original screen in the Screen Design window. From the Screen
menu, select the Object Order... option. This option opens the Object Order
dialog, where screen objects are listed according to their keyboard access
order. To change the access order for the objects, click the button to the
left of the object and drag the object to its new keyboard access position.
Then rebuild your application to include the new field access order.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 6</h3>
 
<P>
When generating screens in FoxPro version 2.0, I was able to specify what
code to generate. Options included adding code to open and close files, to
define and release windows, and to create modal screens. Is this option
still available?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 6</h3>
 
<P>
Yes. The Generate Screen dialog contains a More button. Choose this button
to view the generate code options.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 7</h3>
 
<P>
The Color option is no longer on the Screen menu. How do I specify colors
for my screen objects?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 7</h3>
 
<P>
To specify colors, first select the object or a group of objects. To modify
the background color of the object select Fill Color from the Object menu.
To modify the outline and text of an object, select Pen Color from the
Object menu.
<P>
The AUTOMATIC setting will match the Windows color sets.
<P>
To change the background of the entire screen, choose Layout... from the
Screen menu and click the Color option. You may choose a specific color or
select a wallpaper pattern by clicking Wallpaper and specifying a specific
.BMP file.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 8</h3>
 
<P>
When I use an @... SAY statement to display the contents of a general
field, nothing appears. What am I doing wrong?
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 8</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Picture tool to display the contents of a general field. The Field
tool can't display a picture.
<P>
<P><h3>Question 9</h3>
 
<P>
I used the Picture tool to add a picture field to my screen and specified
the appropriate .BMP file. Please explain in more detail how the options in
the area called If Picture and Frame Different Size affect the display of
the picture. The options are Clip Picture, Scale Picture - Retain Shape and
Scale Picture - Fill the Frame.
<P>
<P><h3>Answer 9</h3>
 
<P>
The following options apply only when the picture and frame are of a
different size.
<P>
Choose Clip Picture if you want to retain the original dimensions of the
picture. If the picture is larger than the frame only a portion of the
image is displayed beginning with the top-left portion of the picture. Any
portion of the picture that extends beyond the frame is hidden.
<P>
Choose Scale Picture - Retain Shape if you want to retain the overall shape
of the picture but fill as much of the frame as possible. The picture is
protected from vertical or horizontal distortion.
<P>
Choose Scale Picture - Fill the Frame if you want to fill the frame
completely. The picture is horizontally or vertically distorted as needed
to fill the frame.
<P>
Question 10
<P>
I want to create a screen that allows online editing,
while a READ is active, of OLE objects stored in a general
field. When I add a picture to my screen
using the picture tool, I'm not able to edit the
displayed .BMP file. Is there a way to do this?
<P>
Answer 10
<P>
Use the Field tool in the Screen Design window to create
a general field in your screen. Select the WHEN clause and
enter the command MODIFY GENERAL &lt;field name&gt; in the code
snippet area. Save the screen and generate your screen
and/or application. Now you will be able to edit the
bitmap within the screen when the application is running.
 
<P>
Question 11
<P>
Why can't I type as many characters into an input field as
it appears will fit?
<P>
Answer 11
<P>
In a proportional font, each character is given as much
horizontal space as it needs and no more. For example, a
lowercase "f" requires much less space than an uppercase
"W." When an input field displays in a screen, FoxPro
calculates the display width of the field by multiplying
the number of characters in the table field structure by
the average size of a character in the specified font. If
the field is filled with characters that are wider than
average, the characters don't all fit within the display
width of the input field and so the characters scroll. If
the field is filled with characters that are narrower than
average, the characters don't fill the display width of
the input field.
 
<P>
Question 12
<P>
How do I control the length of a memory variable
independent of the size of an input field defined with
@ ... GET ... SIZE?
<P>
Answer 12
<P>
Use a picture clause to control the memory variable's
length, and an @ ... GET ... SIZE clause to control the
width of the input field.
 
<P>
Question 13
<P>
How can I be sure that a font I choose will be available
at the client site?
<P>
Answer 13
<P>
The safest way is to look in your WIN.INI file for
fonts that have the words "All res" on the line. These
are standard Windows fonts and consequently are those
most likely to be available at a client site.
<P>
Question 14
<P>
How do I coordinate Browse Windows with Screens?
<P>
Answer 14
<P>
Page D2-96 of the FoxPro for Windows "Developer's Guide"
<PRE> and page D2-90 of the FoxPro for MS-DOS "Developers
</PRE></OL>Guide" give samples for coordinating Browse windows with
screens but omits the SAVE clause in the example. If
the optional BROWSE parameter SAVE is omitted, the Browse
window will close as soon as any other object is clicked.
<P>
The code example should be changed to read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   IF NOT WVISIBLE("Client List")
      BROWSE NORMAL NOWAIT NODELETE LAST;
         TITLE "Client List" ;
         NOAPPEND NOMENU SAVE FIELDS company ;
         WHEN showgets()
   ENDIF

   IF NOT WVISIBLE("Account Details")
      SELECT details
         BROWSE NORMAL NOWAIT NODELETE LAST;
            TITLE "Client List" ;
            NOAPPEND NOMENU SAVE  ;
            FIELDS ;
            Trans_type:10, ;
            Trans_date:10, ;
            Amt:7,Service
      SELECT clients
   ENDIF

</PRE>Question 15
<P>
Are the Keyboard Shortcuts for FoxPro for Windows screen
builder documented?
<P>
Answer 15
<P>
FoxPro for Windows requires a mouse. MS-DOS users who are
used to using the keyboard for creating screens are often
confused by the lack of keyboard support in the Screen
Builder. In a graphical environment such as Windows, the
mouse provides a more effective means of locating and/or moving
objects than the keyboard does.
<P>
To complete the transition from designing with the keyboard
to designing with the mouse, icons have been added for every
tool in the Screen Builder. These icons take the place of the
menu shortcuts that exist in FoxPro for MS-DOS.
<P>
Question 16
<P>
I developed a screen in 1024x768 resolution and it does not appear
consistent with lower resolutions such as 640x480. How can I develop
a screen that will run on multiple resolutions?
<P>
Answer 16
<P>
Here are a few things to keep in mind:

<OL><P><LI>Develop the application using the lowest resolution that the
</OL>application will be run on. If this is 640x480, then that is the
resolution you should develop the application in. Maintaining a
separate screen set for each resolution is definitely an option as
well. You can use SYSMETRIC(1) and SYSMETRIC(2) to
determine the resolution, and
then do something like the following:
<P>
<PRE>     DO CASE
     CASE m.resolution = HiRes
       SET PATH TO scrns1
     CASE m.resolution = MedRes
       SET PATH to scrns2
     ...

</PRE></OL>This is particularly easy to implement if you follow the procedure
of placing your screen functions in a separate program.

<OL><P><LI>Try not to use a screen font like MS Sans Serif. Instead, use
</OL>True Type fonts, and set the FoxPro screen font to the 'base'
development font of the application. For example, if your
application font is Arial 11, you would issue a this command  in
the initial setup code of the application:
<P>
<PRE>     MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN FONT 'Arial',11

</PRE></OL>Using True Type font ensures better scaling between platforms.
Keep in mind that True Type Fonts are not available in Windows 3.0.

<OL><P><LI>Follow general Windows interface design guidelines, such as
</OL>leaving plenty of space around objects, and not placing objects too
close to the edge of a window.

Part 5: Printer Driver Questions
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Questions</h3>
 
<P>
1   How do I use @ ... SAY Commands and Control Codes
<PRE>    to Print in FP/W.

</PRE></OL>2   How can I edit an existing MS-DOS style printer driver
<PRE>    or create a new one.

</PRE>3   How can I invoke the Windows Printer Driver Setup Dialog
<PRE>     from a program.

</PRE><h3>4   How do I access DOS printer drivers in FoxPro Windows?</h3>
 
<P>
Question 1
<P>
How do I use @ ... SAY Commands and Control Codes to Print
in FP/W.
<P>
Answer 1
<P>
FoxPro for Windows cannot send control codes directly to a
printer using a Windows printer driver. There are two
techniques to work around this:

<UL><LI>Open the printer in "raw mode," bypassing the Windows
   printer driver and communicating directly with the printer.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Write all output to a text file, then copy the text file
   to a printer port.
<P>
</UL>Writing FoxPro for Windows programs that send control codes
directly to a printer is not normally recommended. Only use
these techniques when adapting existing FoxPro for MS-DOS
code that sends control codes to the printer.
<P>
The following examples send control codes to switch an Epson
FX-80 dot-matrix printer's compressed mode on and off.
<P>
NOTE: When using these techniques, do not use any of the
? or ?? commands for output. Only use @ ... SAY commands.
<P>
<P><h3>Technique 1: Open the Printer in Raw Mode</h3>
 
<P>
There are two ways to open the printer in raw mode:

<UL><LI>Use the ??? " " command.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the SET PDSETUP TO &lt;driver name&gt; command.
<P>
</UL>Use the ??? " " Command:
<P>
Issue SET DEVICE TO PRINT and SET PRINTER TO commands to
turn off all open print commands.
<P>
Issue a ??? " " command to open the printer in raw mode.
<P>
Issue @ ... SAY commands to send control codes and text
to the printer.
<P>
After printing, issue a SET PRINTER TO command to flush
the print buffer and return control to the Windows
printer driver.
<P>
The following code demonstrates these steps:
<P>
<PRE>   SET DEVICE TO PRINT
   SET PRINTER TO
   ??? " "
   @ 1,0 SAY 'NORMAL TEXT'
   @ 2,0 SAY CHR(15) &amp;&amp; Control code to turn compressed mode on
   @ 2,0 SAY 'CONDENSED text?'
   @ 3,0 SAY CHR(18) &amp;&amp; Control code to turn compressed mode off
   @ 3,0 SAY 'NORMAL again'
   SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
   SET PRINTER TO

</PRE>NOTE: In some circumstances, the last @ ... SAY command
may not print. If this problem occurs, add an additional
@ ... SAY command that prints a blank line (so that the
lost line is just a blank).
<P>
Use the SET PDSETUP TO &lt;Driver Name&gt; Command:
<P>
Issue a SET PRINTER TO command to clear the print buffer
of all open print commands.
<P>
Issue a SET PDSETUP TO &lt;driver name&gt; command to open the
printer in raw mode. You MUST already have an existing
FoxPro 2.0 or 2.6 for MS-DOS printer driver in the current
resource file.
<P>
NOTE: The important property of this command is that
setting a FoxPro for MS-DOS printer driver opens the printer
in raw mode. The printer driver itself is not used to control
printing (that is done though control codes). In fact, any
FoxPro for MS-DOS printer driver can be used.
<P>
Issue a SET DEVICE TO PRINTER command to direct the @ ... SAY
commands to the printer.
<P>
Issue @ ... SAY commands to send control codes and text to
the printer.
<P>
After printing, issue a SET DEVICE TO SCREEN command to
redirect the output to the screen.
<P>
Issue a SET PRINTER TO command to flush the print buffer
and return control to the Windows printer driver.
<P>
The following code demonstrates these steps:
<P>
<PRE>   SET PRINTER TO
   SET PDSETUP TO "Epson"
   SET DEVICE TO PRINT

   @ 1, 0 SAY 'NORMAL text'
   @ 2, 0 SAY  CHR(15) &amp;&amp; Control code to turn compressed mode on
   @ 2, 0 SAY  'CONDENSED text'
   @ 3, 0 SAY  CHR(18) &amp;&amp; Control code to turn compressed mode on
   @ 3, 0 SAY 'normal again'

   SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
   SET PRINT TO

</PRE><h3>Technique 2: Write to Text File and Copy to Printer Port</h3>
 
<P>
Issue a SET DEVICE TO FILE &lt;filename&gt; command to direct output
to a file.
<P>
Issue @ ... SAY commands to send control codes or text
to the printer.
<P>
Issue a SET DEVICE TO SCREEN command to redirect output to
the screen.
<P>
Issue a SET SAFETY OFF command so FoxPro for Windows does not
confirm copying the output file to the printer port (which it
believes to be a file).
<P>
Issue a COPY FILE &lt;filename&gt; TO &lt;printer port&gt;.DOS command to
copy the output file to the printer port.
<P>
Issue a SET SAFETY ON command to turn safety on again.
<P>
The following code demonstrates these steps:
<P>
<PRE>   SET DEVICE TO FILE output.prn

   @ 1,0 SAY 'NORMAL text'
   @ 2,0 SAY CHR(15) &amp;&amp; Control code to turn compressed mode on
   @ 2,0 SAY 'CONDENSED text'
   @ 3, 0 SAY CHR(18) &amp;&amp; Control code to turn compressed mode off
   @ 3, 0 SAY 'Back to normal text'

   SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
   SET SAFETY OFF
   COPY FILE output.prn TO lpt1.dos
   SET SAFETY ON

</PRE>When Windows prints to a file named LPT1.DOS, MS-DOS
interprets the request to open the file LPT1.DOS as a
request to send data to the printer port, and it sends
the data out through its own printing handler. Because
Windows thinks that LPT1.DOS is an MS-DOS file, the Print
Manager is not used.
<P>
Question 2
<P>
How can I edit an existing MS-DOS style printer driver
or create a new one.
<P>
Answer 2
<P>
In FoxPro for Windows, the SET PDSETUP TO &lt;driver_name&gt;
command selects only an existing MS-DOS style printer
driver. It cannot edit an existing MS-DOS style printer
driver or create a new one.
<P>
To use the SET PDSETUP TO &lt;driver_name&gt; command in FoxPro
for Windows, the current resource file (by default
FOXUSER.DBF and its associated memo file, FOXUSER.FPT)
must already have an MS-DOS style printer driver loaded.
This MS-DOS style printer driver must have been previously
created by FoxPro for MS-DOS.
<P>
FoxPro for Windows normally uses Windows printer drivers
for all its printing. Windows printer drivers are changed
through the Windows Control Panel.
<P>
Only use the SET PDSETUP TO &lt;driver_name&gt; command with
character-based reports that were created in FoxPro for
MS-DOS.
<P>
NOTE: The SET PDSETUP &lt;driver_name&gt; command has no effect
on Windows printer drivers.
<P>
Question 3
<P>
How can I invoke the Windows Printer Driver Setup Dialog
from a program.
<P>
Answer 3
<P>
There are two methods to invoke the Windows Printer Driver
Setup Dialog.
<P>
The first method is to use the new function SYS(1037)
<P>
The second method is to use a RUN command.  The following
example illustrates this:
<P>
<PRE>  RUN /N control printers

</PRE>NOTE: These commands will not work with Windows version 3.0.
For example, the RUN /N CONTROL.EXE PRINTERS command will
only run the Control Panel; it will not open the Printers
dialog box.
<P>
Question 4
<P>
How do I access DOS printer drivers in FoxPro Windows?
<P>
Answer 4
<P>
In FoxPro for Windows, the SET PDSETUP TO &lt;driver_name&gt;
command selects only an existing MS-DOS style printer driver.
It cannot edit an existing MS-DOS style printer driver or
create a new one.
<P>
To use the SET PDSETUP TO &lt;driver_name&gt; command in FoxPro
for Windows, the current resource file (by default
FOXUSER.DBF and its associated memo file, FOXUSER.FPT)
must already have an MS-DOS style printer driver loaded.
This MS-DOS style printer driver must have been previously
created by FoxPro for MS-DOS.
<P>
FoxPro for Windows normally uses Windows printer drivers
for all its printing.
<P>
Only use the SET PDSETUP TO &lt;driver_name&gt; command with
character-based reports that were created in FoxPro for
MS-DOS.
<P>
NOTE: The SET PDSETUP &lt;driver_name&gt; command has no effect
on Windows printer drivers.
