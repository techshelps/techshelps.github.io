The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b
   on the following platforms: NT, Win95
<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Visual FoxPro version 3.0 for Windows or Macintosh, sizing the partition
of a grid in the Form Designer beyond a certain size, usually in the range
of 300 to 330 pixels, causes one of the following to occur at run time:
<P>
<PRE>   Error loading file - Partition - record number &lt;n&gt;. Expression evaluated
   to an illegal value.

   -or-

   The partition number is reset to zero and a normal grid is displayed at
   run time.

</PRE>If it's Visual FoxPro for Windows version 5.0, no error is returned, but if
the partition is above the threshold, the partition is set to zero.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the partition needs to be set to a large number in the range between 300
to 350 pixels, set the Partition property of the grid in the Init event of
the grid. For example, use the following code to set the partition at half
the width of the grid:
<P>
<PRE>   Thisform.Grid1.Partition = Thisform.Grid1.Width / 2

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Partition property specifies whether or not a Grid control is split
into two panels and specifies where the split is relative to the left edge
of the grid.
<P>
Once the above error is received, the form cannot be opened even in the
Form Designer without receiving the error again. To work around this error,
the form must opened as a table by issuing USE &lt;formname&gt;.SCX in the
Command window. Then go to the record listed in the error message and open
the Properties memo field and change the "Partition = " line to 0 or at
least a smaller value.
<P>
NOTE: Setting the form's ScaleMode to foxels from pixels has no effect on
this problem
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new form and add a grid.

<P><LI>Set the width of the grid to 400.

<P><LI>Click on the grid and set the partition width to a 350.

<P><LI>Run the form.
<P>
</OL>Repeat the above steps, but set the Partition property to around 305 and
note that the property resets to 0.
<P>
In testing, the error seems to occur around when the partition size is set
in the vicinity of 300 to 330. This error does not seem to depend upon
screen resolution and the font used in the grid.
