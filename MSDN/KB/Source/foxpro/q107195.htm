<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The BROWSE FREEZE command allows a single field in a Browse window to be
modified, with the remainder of the fields automatically browsed as read-
only fields. It is often desirable to have a mixture of several fields that
are read-only and several fields that are read/write in the Browse window.
There are three methods (described below) that can be used to accomplish
this.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The three methods below browse the FOXPRO\TUTORIAL\CUSTOMER database, with
the CNO, COMPANY, and YTDPURCH fields being read-only, and the CONTACT,
ADDRESS and CITY fields being read/write.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Using the BROWSE FORMAT Command</h3>
 
<P>
A format file can be used to control the Browse window. The row and column
positions are not important. To browse a read-only field, place an @ ...
SAY &lt;field&gt; command in the file. To browse a read/write field, place an @
... GET &lt;field&gt; command in the file. If a read/write field has a PICTURE,
WHEN, or VALID clause associated with it, add the clause at the end of the
@ ... GET command in the format file.

<OL><P><LI>Create a format file using the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CREATE FILE customer.fmt
</PRE>
<P><LI>Place the following commands in the format file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      @ 1,1 SAY cno
      @ 2,2 SAY company
      @ 3,3 SAY ytdpurch
      @ 4,4 GET contact
      @ 5,5 GET address
      @ 6,6 GET city
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the file and issue the following command to activate the format
   file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SET FORMAT TO customer.fmt
</PRE>
<P><LI>Issue the following command to begin the browse:
<P>
<P><PRE>      BROWSE FORMAT
</PRE>
<P><LI>After the browse is complete, deactivate the format file with the
   following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CLOSE FORMAT
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Using Calculated Fields on the BROWSE STATEMENT</h3>
 
<P>
The second method involves using a calculated field on the BROWSE command
itself for each read-only field desired. This method takes fewer steps;
however, it requires that a calculated field name be created for each read-
only field. For example, issue the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   BROWSE FIELDS ;
      custno=cno, companynm = company, yrlypurch = ytdpurch, ;
      contact, address, city

</PRE></OL><h3>Method 3: Using the :R Option with a Fields List</h3>
 
<P>
The third method involves using a read-only (:R) specifier for each field
that should be read-only. For example, issue the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   BROWSE FIELDS ;
      cno:R, company:R, ytdpurch:R, ;
      contact, address, city
</PRE>
