This article contains answers to frequently asked questions about Microsoft
FoxPro version 2.6 for Windows. This article is divided into four sections:
<P>
<PRE>   Installation
   Cross-Platform
   Screen Builder
   Printer Drivers

</PRE><h2>PART 1: INSTALLATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. What are the minimum files required to run FoxPro?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Not all files placed on the hard disk during installation of FoxPro
       are absolutely required for operation of the product.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       The minimum files needed to run FoxPro version 2.6, use the menu and
       screen generators, and set printer drivers are listed below.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       NOTE: Upon startup, FoxPro will create FOXUSER.DBF and FOXUSER.FPT
       files, and upon screen or menu generation, it will create the
       appropriate .FXP files.
</PRE><P>

                                      files from FoxPro version 2.0 for
                                      MS-DOS or want to create cross-
                                      platform applications.

</PRE></OL><h2>PART 2: CROSS-PLATFORM</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. Why doesn't my low-level file I/O program work in FoxPro for
<P><PRE>       Windows?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. FoxPro for Windows cannot access the COM ports with the low-level
       file commands.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       This fact is mentioned in the documentation for the FOPEN() command,
       but many people who are accustomed to opening a port in FoxPro for
       MS-DOS may test this function and think it doesn't work correctly.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       This behavior is not a bug--it is part of the product's design. In
       the Windows multitasking environment, other applications besides
       FoxPro may also be using the COM ports. Therefore, it is not
       desirable to allow a Windows-based application to take exclusive
       control of the communications port.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       Access to the COM port is provided through FOXTOOLS.FLL and the
       Windows API calls. For an example of how to use the COM port under
       the Windows environment, see the DIALER.PRG file in the
       FOXPROW\GOODIES\FOXTOOLS subdirectory.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       The use of the REGFN() and CALLFN() functions is documented in the
       FOXTOOLS.WRI file in the same directory as the DIALER.PRG example.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       For information about specific API calls, refer to the Windows
       Software Development Kit (SDK) documentation.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h2>PART 3: SCREEN BUILDER</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. How do I coordinate Browse windows with screens?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Page D2-96 of the FoxPro for Windows "Developer's Guide" and page
       D2-90 of the FoxPro for MS-DOS "Developers Guide" give samples for
       coordinating Browse windows with screens but omit the SAVE clause in
       the example. If the optional BROWSE parameter SAVE is omitted, the
       Browse window will close as soon as any other object is clicked.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       The code examples should be changed to read as follows:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          IF NOT WVISIBLE("Client List")
             BROWSE NORMAL NOWAIT NODELETE LAST TITLE "Client List" ;
                NOAPPEND NOMENU SAVE FIELDS company ;
                WHEN showgets()
          ENDIF

          IF NOT WVISIBLE("Account Details")
             SELECT details
                BROWSE NORMAL NOWAIT NODELETE LAST TITLE "Client List" ;
                   NOAPPEND NOMENU SAVE  ;
                   FIELDS ;
                   Trans_type:10, ;
                   Trans_date:10, ;
                   Amt:7,Service
             SELECT clients
          ENDIF

</PRE><P><LI> Q. Are the keyboard shortcuts for the FoxPro for Windows Screen Builder
<P><PRE>       documented?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. FoxPro for Windows requires a mouse. In a graphical environment such
       as Windows, the mouse provides a more effective means of locating
       and/or moving objects than the keyboard does.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       To complete the transition from designing with the keyboard to
       designing with the mouse, icons have been added for every tool in
       the Screen Builder. These icons take the place of the menu shortcuts
       that exist in FoxPro for MS-DOS.
</PRE><P>
</OL>PART 4: PRINTER DRIVER QUESTIONS
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. How do I use @ ... SAY Commands and control codes to print in FoxPro
<P><PRE>       for Windows?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. FoxPro for Windows cannot send control codes directly to a printer
       using a Windows printer driver. There are two techniques you can use
       to work around this:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - Open the printer in "raw mode," bypassing the Windows printer
          driver and communicating directly with the printer.

          -or-

        - Write all output to a text file, then copy the text file to a
          printer port.

       Writing FoxPro for Windows programs that send control codes directly
       to a printer is not normally recommended. Only use these techniques
       when adapting existing FoxPro for MS-DOS code that sends control
       codes to the printer.

       The following examples send control codes to switch an Epson FX-80
       dot-matrix printer's compressed mode on and off.

       NOTE: When using these techniques, do not use any of the ? or ??
       commands for output. Only use @ ... SAY commands.

       Technique 1: Open the Printer in Raw Mode
       -----------------------------------------

       There are two ways to open the printer in raw mode:

        - Use the ??? " " command.

          -or-

        - Use the SET PDSETUP TO &lt;driver name&gt; command.


       Use the ??? " " Command:

       Issue SET DEVICE TO PRINT and SET PRINTER TO commands to turn off
       all open print commands.

       Issue a ??? " " command to open the printer in raw mode.

       Issue @ ... SAY commands to send control codes and text to the
       printer.

       After printing, issue a SET PRINTER TO command to flush the print
       buffer and return control to the Windows printer driver.

          SET PRINTER TO
          SET PDSETUP TO "Epson"
          SET PRINTER ON
          SET DEVICE TO PRINT

          @ 1, 0 SAY 'NORMAL text'
          @ 2, 0 SAY  CHR(15)   &amp;&amp; Control code to turn compressed mode on
          @ 2, 0 SAY  'CONDENSED text'
          @ 3, 0 SAY  CHR(18)   &amp;&amp; Control code to turn compressed mode off
          @ 3, 0 SAY 'normal again'

          SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
          SET PRINTER OFF
          SET PRINTER TO

       NOTE: In some circumstances, the last @ ... SAY command may not
       print. If this problem occurs, add an additional @ ... SAY command
       that prints a blank line (so that the lost line is just a blank).


       Use the SET PDSETUP TO &lt;Driver Name&gt; Command:

       Issue a SET PRINTER TO command to clear the print buffer of all open
       print commands.

       Issue a SET PDSETUP TO &lt;driver name&gt; command to open the printer in
       raw mode. You MUST already have an existing FoxPro version 2.0, 2.5,
       or 2.6 for MS-DOS printer driver in the current resource file.

       NOTE: The important property of this command is that setting a
       FoxPro for MS-DOS printer driver opens the printer in raw mode. The
       printer driver itself is not used to control printing (that is done
       though control codes). In fact, any FoxPro for MS-DOS printer driver
       can be used.

       Issue a SET DEVICE TO PRINTER command to direct the @ ... SAY
       commands to the printer.

       Issue @ ... SAY commands to send control codes and text to the
       printer.

       After printing, issue a SET DEVICE TO SCREEN command to redirect the
       output to the screen.

       Issue a SET PRINTER TO command to flush the print buffer and return
       control to the Windows printer driver.

       The following code demonstrates these steps:

          SET PRINTER TO
          SET PDSETUP TO "Epson"
          SET DEVICE TO PRINT

          @ 1, 0 SAY 'NORMAL text'
          @ 2, 0 SAY  CHR(15) &amp;&amp; Control code to turn compressed mode on
          @ 2, 0 SAY  'CONDENSED text'
          @ 3, 0 SAY  CHR(18) &amp;&amp; Control code to turn compressed mode on
          @ 3, 0 SAY 'normal again'

          SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
          SET PRINT TO

       Technique 2: Write to Text File and Copy to Printer Port
       --------------------------------------------------------

       Issue a SET DEVICE TO FILE &lt;filename&gt; command to direct output to a
       file.

       Issue @ ... SAY commands to send control codes or text to the
       printer.

       Issue a SET DEVICE TO SCREEN command to redirect output to the
       screen.

       Issue a SET SAFETY OFF command so FoxPro for Windows does not
       confirm copying the output file to the printer port (which it
       believes to be a file).

       Issue a COPY FILE &lt;filename&gt; TO &lt;printer port&gt;.DOS command to copy
       the output file to the printer port.

       Issue a SET SAFETY ON command to turn safety on again.

       The following code demonstrates these steps:

          SET DEVICE TO FILE output.prn

          @ 1,0 SAY 'NORMAL text'
          @ 2,0 SAY CHR(15) &amp;&amp; Control code to turn compressed mode on
          @ 2,0 SAY 'CONDENSED text'
          @ 3, 0 SAY CHR(18) &amp;&amp; Control code to turn compressed mode off
          @ 3, 0 SAY 'Back to normal text'

          SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
          SET SAFETY OFF
          COPY FILE output.prn TO lpt1.dos
          SET SAFETY ON

       When Windows prints to a file named LPT1.DOS, MS-DOS interprets the
       request to open the file LPT1.DOS as a request to send data to the
       printer port, and it sends the data out through its own printing
       handler. Because Windows thinks that LPT1.DOS is an MS-DOS file, the
       Print Manager is not used.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. How can I edit an existing MS-DOS-style printer driver or create a
<P><PRE>       new one?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. In FoxPro for Windows, the SET PDSETUP TO &lt;driver_name&gt; command
       selects only an existing MS-DOS-style printer driver. It cannot edit
       an existing MS-DOS-style printer driver or create a new one.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       To use the SET PDSETUP TO &lt;driver_name&gt; command in FoxPro for
       Windows, the current resource file (by default FOXUSER.DBF and its
       associated memo file, FOXUSER.FPT) must already have an MS-DOS-style
       printer driver loaded. This MS-DOS-style printer driver must have
       been previously created by FoxPro for MS-DOS.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       FoxPro for Windows normally uses Windows printer drivers for all of
       its printing. Windows printer drivers are modified through the
       Windows Control Panel.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       Only use the SET PDSETUP TO &lt;driver_name&gt; command with character-
       based reports that were created in FoxPro for MS-DOS.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       NOTE: The SET PDSETUP &lt;driver_name&gt; command has no effect on Windows
       printer drivers.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How can I invoke the Windows Printer Driver Setup dialog box from a
<P><PRE>       program?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. There are two methods to invoke the Windows Printer Driver Setup
       dialog box:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - The first method is to use the new function SYS(1037).

          SYS(1037) is for use in FoxPro for Windows and Macintosh 2.6x.
          SYS(1037) displays the Print Setup dialog box, allowing you to
          make adjustments to printer settings such as the paper size and
          orientation. The settings you can adjust in this dialog box
          depend on the printer driver you've installed. You can also
          choose Print Setup from the File menu to display the FoxPro Print
          Setup dialog box.

          NOTE: SYS(1037) always returns a null string.

        - The second method is to use a RUN command. The following example
          illstrates this:

             RUN /N control printers

          NOTE: This command will not work with Windows version 3.0. For
          example, the RUN /N CONTROL.EXE PRINTERS command will only run
          the Control Panel in Windows 3.0; it will not open the Printer
          Setup dialog box.
