The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for UNIX, version 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When migrating SCO FoxBASE+ files into FoxPro for UNIX, it is helpful to
know which FoxBASE+ files can be used in their native format and which
files will be transported to FoxPro for UNIX format.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: This testing was done with FoxPro for UNIX version 2.6 and SCO
FoxBASE+ release 2.1.2d.
<P>
<P><h3>.DBF Files</h3>
 
<P>
When migrating SCO FoxBASE+ .DBF files to FoxPro for UNIX, .DBF files can
be opened, changed and have records added and deleted as if the .DBF were
created in FoxPro for UNIX.
<P>
<P><h3>.IDX Files</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro for UNIX opens and uses .IDX files as long as INDEX=IDX is in the
CONFIG.FPU file. Otherwise, FoxPro for UNIX creates and uses .CDX index
files.
<P>
<P><h3>.DBT Files</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro for UNIX uses and writes to .DBT memo files that were created in
SCO FoxBASE+ without any user interaction.
<P>
<P><h3>.LBL Files</h3>
 
<P>
To use SCO FoxBASE+ .LBL files in FoxPro for UNIX, LABEL=LBL must be in the
CONFIG.FPU file. At the end of each label line, you should see a semicolon
(;) as the last character.
<P>
<P><h3>.FRM Files</h3>
 
<P>
REPORT=FRM must be in the CONFIG.FPU file for FoxPro for UNIX to see .FRM
files as valid report files. The page number and the date will be at the
top of the report instead of in the page footer.
<P>
<P><h3>.PRG Files</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro for UNIX puts a semicolon (;) at the end of the last line in a .PRG
file that was originally created in SCO FoxBASE+. This can be seen when
editing the .PRG in FoxPro for UNIX. The .PRG file will run correctly as
long as the line containing the semicolon (;) is the last line of the
program file.
<P>
<P><h3>.MEM Files</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro for UNIX will restore memory variables (memvars) and place them into
memory.
<P>
<P><h3>.VUE Files</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro for UNIX will open and use .VUE files creaed in SCO FoxBASE+ without
modification. You should be able to restore all of the following from a
FoxBASE+ .VUE file in FoxPro for UNIX: databases, indexes, alternates,
format files, fields in SET FIELDS lists, relations, filters, ON/OFF switch
settings (with ALL specified), current function key settings, ON ESCAPE and
ON KEY settings, DEFAULT and PATH settings, and procedure file settings.
