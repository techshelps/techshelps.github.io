The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Clicking the mouse anywhere other than on the prompts that are
displayed when a menu is created with the @...PROMPT and MENU TO
commands will cause FoxPro to endlessly cycle through all the
displayed prompts. The only way to exit this cycle is to press ESC to
cancel the program or to click a quit prompt. The mouse will not cause
problems when a prompt is clicked on. The mouse will also function
while in the endless cycle if a prompt is clicked. However, the
keyboard will be disabled while in the endless cycle. You can
sometimes use ON KEY LABEL assignments to break out of the endless
cycle.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro for Windows offers several alternative ways to create menus
similar to popup menus. These methods should be used if the MENU TO
and @... PROMPT method causes problems. Using the Menu Builder or
using push buttons are two alternatives.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in FoxPro 2.5 for
Windows. This problem was corrected in FoxPro 2.5a for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The MENU TO command is used to activate menu popups created with
@...PROMPT. It is an old command that is included in FoxPro for
backward compatibility with FoxBASE+. FoxBASE+ programs that are
converted to FoxPro for Windows may contain menu popups that are
created with these commands. These menu popups will work properly if
only the keyboard is used to choose the menu items or if the mouse is
clicked only on the actual prompts.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
The following sample program can be used to illustrate the problem:
<P>
<PRE>   ON KEY LABEL F12 WAIT WINDOW "Hello"    &amp;&amp; This may stop the cycle.
   ON KEY LABEL F9 CANCEL              &amp;&amp; This may cancel the program.
