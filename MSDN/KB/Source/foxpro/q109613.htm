The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b
<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Although the RUN command can be used to launch other programs from FoxPro
on the MS-DOS and Windows platforms, in FoxPro for Macintosh, the "Feature
Not Available" error message is generated when the RUN command is used.
<P>
To launch another application from FoxPro for Macintosh, use the RUNSCRIPT
command to execute an AppleScript that contains a scripting command to
launch the desired application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
AppleScript is an extension available for Macintosh system software release
7.0x that adds functionality to the Macintosh operating system by providing
a standard protocol for communication between applications. It is part of
Apple's Open Scripting Architecture.
<P>
Because FoxPro for Macintosh is AppleScript aware, it can run prewritten
scripts using the RUNSCRIPT command. The syntax of the RUNSCRIPT command
can be found in the FoxPro for Macintosh "Language Reference" and in the
online help file.
<P>
To launch an application using AppleScript, the application must be Apple-
event-aware and support the open application ("oapp") Apple Event. An Apple
event is a high-level message that is passed from one application to
another, including the operating system. Most applications, especially
those written or updated since System 7 was released, support the basic
high-level events; the open application event is one of these.
<P>
The sample scripts below show two methods, one interactive and one
noninteractive, that can be used to launch another Macintosh application.
To use these scripts, type them into the AppleScript Editor, save them, and
then run them from Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh using the RUNSCRIPT
command.
<P>
NOTE: Double hyphens represent comments to the AppleScript interpreter. Due
to the limitations of the character set used to print this article, the
command-continuation character produced by pressing OPTION+RETURN on the
Apple keyboard has been replaced by a semicolon (;). Scripting commands are
broken into multiple lines for readability only.
<P>
<P><h3>Interactive Sample Script</h3>
 
<P>
The following script is interactive, allowing the user to choose the
application to run from a standard Macintosh Open dialog box. Only "APPL"
(application) type files are displayed. The chosen application is stored to
the variable "appToRun." An error handler surrounds the code. If the user
clicks Cancel in the "choose file" Open dialog box, the error number -128
is returned. Otherwise, the null string is returned. The FoxPro program
that invokes the script should handle the return value appropriately.
<P>
NOTE: This script sample uses "choose file", a scripting addition provided
with the AppleScript extension and stored in the Scripting Additions folder
in the System Folder:Extensions folder. If "choose file" is not available,
this script will produce an error.
<P>
<PRE>  -- script to run another Macintosh application
  try
     set appToRun to ;
        ((choose file of type {"APPL"}) as string)
     tell application appToRun to run
     return ""
  on error errText number errNum
     return errNum
  end try

</PRE>Save the script with the name RunApp. To run the script, issue the
following command in the FoxPro Command window or from within a FoxPro
program:
<P>
<PRE>  RUNSCRIPT "Macintosh HD:Scripts:RunApp" TO retVal

</PRE>"retVal" contains the value returned from the script--either the null
string or an error number.
<P>
<P><h3>Noninteractive Script Sample</h3>
 
<P>
If you don't need an interactive script, you can use the following script
to launch an application by hard-coding its name into the script; in the
following sample, the application is Microsoft Excel:
<P>
<PRE>  tell application "Macintosh HD:Apps:Excel 4.0:Microsoft Excel" to run

</PRE>NOTE: Remember to replace the pathname to the application as necessary.
