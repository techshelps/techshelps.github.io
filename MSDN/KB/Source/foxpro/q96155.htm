</PRE><P><LI> Q. When a second user runs Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS on my
<P><PRE>       network, the error message "File in use by another" is
       displayed. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. If you are on a peer-to-peer network, you first must load the
       MS-DOS Share program and then verify that the FoxPro files are
       marked as read-only. The FOXUSER database can be shared only if
       the file is marked "R-O" (read-only). If you receive this error
       message when you try to open a database file, make sure that
       both users have EXCLUSIVE set to OFF.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Where does FoxPro store its temporary files on a network?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. FoxPro creates its temporary files in the current working
       directory unless you specifically designate an alternative
       location by including one or more of the EDITWORK, SORTWORK,
       PROGWORK, or TMPFILES statements in the CONFIG.FP file.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       If the local workstations have sizable hard disk drives with
       plenty of free space, you can improve performance in a
       multiuser environment by placing FoxPro's temporary work files
       on the local hard disk drive or on a RAM drive. Redirecting
       these files to a local hard disk drive or a RAM drive provides
       additional speed by reducing the need to access the network
       drive, therefore reducing the amount of network traffic.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       On small networks with older workstations that have slower hard
       disk drives, better performance is sometimes obtained by
       leaving FoxPro's temporary files on the file server. When in
       doubt, direct FoxPro to store temporary files on a local hard
       disk drive.
