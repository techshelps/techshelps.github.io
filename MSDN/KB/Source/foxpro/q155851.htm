The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses ideas for implementing a cross-platform solution
between Microsoft Visual FoxPro 3.0 for the Macintosh and Microsoft Visual
FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can create a cross-platform solution between Visual FoxPro (VFP) 3.0
for the Macintosh and Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows in different ways. For
example, one of the following situations may apply:

<OL><P><LI>A VFP 3.0 for the Macintosh cross-platform application that you want to
   upgrade to VFP 5.0 for Windows but also want to keep using on the
   Macintosh.
</OL>2. A VFP 3.0 for Macintosh application with Macintosh-specific items that
<PRE>   you want to upgrade in Windows 5.0 and use concurrently.
</PRE></OL>3. A VFP 5.0 for Windows application that you want to deploy on VFP 3.0 for
<PRE>   Macintosh and use concurrently.

</PRE>The following recommendations apply to situations 1 and 2. They also apply
to situation 3 as long as the application is written with respect to the
new properties and methods in Visual FoxPro 5.0 that do not exist in Visual
FoxPro 3.0.
<P>
What to Do with the Data
 
<P>
Data between Visual FoxPro 3.0 for Macintosh and Visual FoxPro 5.0 for
Windows is completely transparent with the exception of stored procedures.
To avoid conflicts with stored procedure code, place it in a program
outside of the database and access it when needed using SET PROCEDURE TO
cProcedureProgram. You can open both a Visual FoxPro 3.0 for Macintosh or a
Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows .dbc file without distinction. One
recommendation would be to modify the .dbc file in Visual FoxPro 5.0 for
Windows, so you can have access to the new data features. Another option
would be to keep the .dbc file in VFP 3.0 for Macintosh format (with the
appropriate stored procedures) and use the data in VFP 5.0 for Windows by
using the ODBC driver.
<P>
<P><h3>What to Do with Project Files, Forms, Reports, and So Forth</h3>
 
<P>
Create two different applications from the same source files. The best way
to do this is to have two projects in the same directory (folder)
accessible by both platforms, the one for the Macintosh in VFP 3.0 format
and the one for Windows in VFP 5.0 format. You need to add only Macintosh-
specific files (CFM libraries, PICTS, AppleScript files) to the Macintosh
project--same idea with Windows (specific DLLs if needed).
