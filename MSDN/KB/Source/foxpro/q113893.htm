The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, version 2.6
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Catalog Manager stores information about the currently selected catalog
in a "catalog file." A catalog file is an ordinary .DBF file with an .FPC
extension and the same name as the catalog whose information it contains.
The default file extension for the file containing memo fields associated
with a catalog file is .FCT, whereas the default file extension for a file
containing memo fields associated with a typical .DBF file is .FPT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To support the concept of a catalog file, certain changes were made to the
USE command and to the CREATE TABLE command in FoxPro 2.6 for Windows and
MS-DOS.
<P>
If you create an .FPC file and the file has one or more memo fields, the
associated memo file will be created with an extension of .FCT.
<P>
For example, the following code will produce two files (TEST.FPC and
TEST.FCT):
<P>
<PRE>   CREATE TABLE test.fpc (one C(2), two M)

</PRE>By contrast, the following code will produce a different set of files
(TEST.DBF and TEST.FPT):
<P>
<PRE>   CREATE TABLE test.dbf (one C(2), two M)

</PRE>If the extension of the file is anything other than .FPC and the file
contains a memo field, the associated file will have an extension of .FPT.
The .FCT extension is created only when the table has an extension of .FPC.
<P>
The USE command has also been modified in FoxPro 2.6 for Windows and MS-DOS
to support .FPC files. If a database file ending with an .FPC extension is
opened with a USE command and that database file has a memo field, the USE
command will search for a memo file with an .FCT extension. If the USE
command is issued to open a database file that does not have an .FPC
extension and the database file has a memo field, the USE command will
search for a memo file with a standard .FPT extension.
