<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information below describes the Report Wizard and how to use it to
create a report.
<P>
This information is also found in FoxPro online Help in the "Report
Wizard" topic.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Report Wizard creates a report from a table, using a style,
layout, and sort order that you select.
<P>
<P><h3>REPORT WIZARD STEPS</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1 of 6: Selecting a Table</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: This step is skipped if you start the wizard from the Catalog
Manager, and a table is already in use.
<P>
First select the table or query you want to use. The list contains the
tables that were open when you started the wizard.  If you want to use
a table that is not currently open, choose the Open... button.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2 of 6: Selecting a Report Style</h3>
 
<P>
Select one of the available styles for your report.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 3 of 6: Selecting Fields to Include in the Report</h3>
 
<P>
Select the fields you want to include in your report. The list of
available fields shows all the fields in the table you selected.
<P>
To select fields, you can:

<UL><LI>Double-click each field name in the Available Fields list.

<LI>Select each field name and choose the Add button.

<LI>Choose the Add All button to use all the table fields.
<P>
</UL>If you add a field you don't need, select it and choose the Remove
button.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 4 of 6: Selecting a Report Layout</h3>
 
<P>
Choose Horizontal if you want the field names to appear as column
titles across the top of the page; choose Vertical if you want the
field names to run down the left margin of the report.
<P>
If you need to further adjust the layout of the report, choose the
Printers... button. This displays the Printer Driver Setup dialog,
where you can select a printer driver setup and set printer options.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 5 of 6: Setting the Sort Order for Records</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: This step will be skipped if you are basing your report on a
query.
<P>
To set the order in which records will be displayed in the report,
select up to three fields from the Available Fields list. The selected
fields are combined to create an index tag.
<P>
For example, if you choose State and then City, the records in the
finished report will be sorted by state, and then by city within each
state.
<P>
Choose the Ascending option to sort records from the beginning of the
alphabet, the lowest number, or the earliest date; choose the
Descending option to sort records from the end of the alphabet, the
highest number, or the latest date.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 6 of 6: Naming, Previewing, Saving, or Modifying the Report</h3>
 
<P>
First, enter the title you want to appear at the top of your new
report. Then, choose the Preview... button to see your report in a
preview window. If you are satisfied with the results, select one of
the following options, and choose the Finish button.

<UL><LI>Save Report For Later Use: Creates a Microsoft FoxPro report file
   (.FRX file) that you can later use to run your report.

<LI>Save And Print Report: Displays the Save As dialog so you can name
   the report, then displays the Print dialog so you can print it.

<LI>Modify Report With Design Tool: Saves the report and displays it in
   the Report Layout window, so you can modify it as needed.
