<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Internet is host to over 20 million users, including many FoxPro users.
A variety of resources for FoxPro users are available free of charge on the
Internet.
<P>
Below is a collection of mailing lists, FoxPro archives, and other Internet
resources. E-mail resources are also available from other services.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>FoxPro Archive Sites</h3>
 
<P>
You can access FoxPro archive sites by using the login ID "FTP" and your
E-mail address as the password. Remember to use binary transfer mode for
all non-ASCII files. For help with retrieving files from these sites, see
"How to Retrieve Files from Archive Sites via FTP Transfer" or "How to
Retrieve Files from Archive Sites via Electronic Mail" below. Please try to
use the FTP site nearest you to conserve bandwidth.
<P>
You can upload freely distributable (freeware, shareware, or public domain)
files to lenti.med.umn.edu in the directory /pub/foxpro/incoming. After
uploading, send E-mail to Pete Kruckenberg at &lt;pete@dswi.com&gt; with the
file's name and a description. The file will be moved to /pub/foxpro within
a few days.
<P>
<PRE>   SITE: lenti.med.umn.edu
   IP ADDRESS: 128.101.81.1
   DIRECTORY: /pub/foxpro
   INDEX: /pub/foxpro/index
   UPLOAD TO: /pub/foxpro/incoming
   ADMIN: Gerald Skerbitz &lt;gsker@lenti.med.umn.edu&gt;

   SITE: nstn.ns.ca
   IP ADDRESS: 137.186.128.11
   DIRECTORY: /pub/pc-stuff/foxpro
   INDEX: Not available at this time
   ADMIN: Paul Russell &lt;russell@atl.sofkin.ca&gt;

   SITE: ftp.microsoft.com
   IP ADDRESS: 198.105.232.1
   DIRECTORY: developr/fox
   INDEX: index.txt in each subdirectory
   ADMIN: &lt;ftp@microsoft.com&gt;

   SITE: mercurio.univr.it (mirrors nstn and lenti sites)
   IP ADDRESS: 157.27.1.2
   DIRECTORY: pub/msdos/foxpro
   INDEX: pub/msdos/foxpro/00INDEX and pub/msdos/foxpro/index.txt
   ADMIN: Germano Rossi &lt;germano@chiostro.univr.it&gt;

</PRE><h3>How to Retrieve Files from Archive Sites via FTP Transfer</h3>
 
<P>
All of the FoxPro archive sites listed above use the File Transfer Protocol
(FTP) to upload and download files. The program that you will use to do
this is usually called "ftp". To access an FTP site, start ftp with the
name or IP address of the site as a command-line parameter (for example,
"ftp lenti.med.umn.edu" or "ftp 128.101.81.1").
<P>
Once connected, you will be asked for a login ID. Use "ftp" as your login
ID, then your full E-mail address (for example, "joebob@xyz.com") as your
password. To list a directory, use the "ls" command; to change to a
directory, use the "cd" command (for example, cd /pub/coneill). Before
retrieving a file, you should usually turn on the binary transfer mode
using the "bin" command. Then, use the "get" command to retrieve a file
(for example, "get index.txt"). For help, use the "?" or "help" command. To
exit ftp, type "quit" or "bye".
<P>
<P><h3>How to Retrieve Files from Archive Sites via Electronic Mail</h3>
 
<P>
Users who do not have access to archive sites with FTP transfer can use one
of the E-mail FTP servers. To get information on how to use this service,
send a message to &lt;listserv@ubvm.cc.ubaffalo.edu&gt; with the line
<P>
<PRE>  GET INTERNET BY-EMAIL NETTRAIN F=MAIL

</PRE>in the body of the message. The instructions you receive will give very
detailed information about how to access FTP sites through E-mail.
<P>
This service is somewhat complicated to use, since the files will be in "UU-
encoded" format when you receive them. You will need to obtain a program
that decodes "UU-encoded" files. Your system administrator can help you
obtain this program and decode the files.
<P>
NOTE: It currently is not possible to upload files to the Internet through
this service.
<P>
Here are a few examples of how to use the service:
<P>
<PRE>   To get a directory of what's at lenti.med.umn.edu:

      E-mail address: bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu
      Subject: The subject is not important
      Message body:
         open lenti.med.umn.edu
         cd /pub/foxpro
         ls

   To get the index file from lenti.med.umn.edu:

      E-mail address: bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu
      Subject: The subject is not important
      Message body:
         open lenti.med.umn.edu
         cd /pub/foxpro
         get index

   To get a file from lenti.med.umn.edu:

      E-mail address: bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu
      Subject: The subject is not important
      Message body:
         open lenti.med.umn.edu
         cd /pub/foxpro
         binary [you *must* do this when transferring a non-text file]
         get genscr20.zip

</PRE><h3>Mailing Lists</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Remember not to send mailing list service requests (subscribes,
unsubscribes) to the posting address. Doing so wastes a lot of time, money,
and other resources, and usually upsets a lot of people who don't want to
see "SUBSCRIBE FOXPRO-L John Doe" requests.
<P>
The FoxPro Mailing List:
<P>

&lt;foxpro-l-request@dswi.com&gt; with the word "subscribe" in the subject.

into one digest that is sent out once or twice daily), send E-mail to
&lt;foxpro-d-request@dswi.com&gt; with the word "subscribe" in the subject.

<P><h3>USENET Newsgroup</h3>
 
<P>
comp.databases.xbase.fox is an unmoderated USENET newsgroup currently
receiving about 150-200 messages per week. If your Internet provider
doesn't have this newsgroup, ask your system administrator to add it to the
groups your system receives. A frequently asked questions (FAQ) list is
posted regularly and is also available from lenti.med.umn.edu as the file
/pub/foxpro/foxfaq.zip.
<P>
<P><h3>Electronic Newsletter</h3>
 
<P>
Every month, the Boston Computer Society publishes a free electronic FoxPro
newsletter, which is posted to the USENET group comp.databases.xbase.fox
and is archived at wji.com in the directory fox/ (filenames BCNN*.TXT). If
you would like to receive the newsletter via E-mail, send E-mail to Les
Squires at lsquires@wji.com.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft on the Internet</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Technical Support does not provide technical support for
FoxPro on the Internet. However, Microsoft does have an FTP archive site
(see above) that contains the Microsoft Knowledge Base and the Microsoft
Software Library.
<P>
Microsoft maintains the FoxPro Home Page on the World Wide Web (WWW). This
page contains useful information about FoxPro and pointers to other FoxPro
information on the Internet.
<P>
The FoxPro Home Page address is: <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/foxpro/">http://www.microsoft.com/foxpro/</A></B>
<P>
For information about the technical-support options available for FoxPro,
please call (800) 936-3500.
<P>
If you have a suggestion for enhancements to future versions of FoxPro,
please send E-mail explaining your "wish" to the FoxPro Wish List at
