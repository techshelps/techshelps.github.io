The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to transport reports between FoxPro for Windows
and FoxPro for MS-DOS and FoxPro for Macintosh. The process involved
differs based on which version of FoxPro is running on each platform.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When FoxPro makes the decision to transport a report or screen, the
Transporter program looks for a field named PLATFORM in the .FRX or .SCX
file. This field will contain either "WINDOWS", "DOS", or "MAC" in each
record. The Transporter program determines if any records are contained in
the file for the current platform. If none are found, the records for the
existing platform are copied and edited to work on the current platform.
The Transporter program makes conversions necessary to allow for factors
such as how boxes are drawn in each environment, and how fonts are
implemented in each platform.
<P>
<P><h2>TRANSPORTING FROM FOXPRO FOR MACINTOSH TO FOXPRO VERSION 2.5X FOR WINDOWS</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro version 2.5b for Macintosh was developed after version 2.5b of
FoxPro for Windows. The 2.5x version of TRANSPRT.PRG released with Windows
does not recognize a value of "MAC" in the platform field. When a Macintosh
report is opened in Windows, the Transporter program is unable to perform
the conversions necessary from the Macintosh platform.
<P>
FoxPro for Macintosh creates a default record for the Windows platform,
with a text string placed in the report header indicating that the report
must be transported.
<P>
<P><h2>TRANSPORTING FROM FOXPRO FOR MACINTOSH TO FOXPRO VERSION 2.5X FOR MS-DOS</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro for Macintosh was released after FoxPro version 2.5b for MS-DOS. The
Transporter program shipped with the MS-DOS version does not recognize
records from the Macintosh platform.
<P>
FoxPro for Macintosh does not create a default record for the MS-DOS
platform, since reports are not usually transported from a graphical
environment to a character-based environment.
<P>
If the MS-DOS Transporter is invoked, the FoxPro for Macintosh option will
be grayed out. If the FoxPro for Windows option is chosen, the Transporter
program will fail with a subscript error.
<P>
<P><h3>Resolutions</h3>
 
<P>
There are three alternative methods of transporting these reports:

<UL><LI>Create the report in the older platform (MS-DOS or Windows) first,
   then transport it to the Macintosh.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Copy the TRANSPRT.PRG, GENSCRN.PRG and GENMENU.PRG programs from FoxPro
   for the Macintosh to the other platform and use them to replace the
   existing copies on that platform.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Upgrade to version 2.6 on the Windows or MS-DOS platform.
<P>
</UL><h3>TRANSPORTING FROM MACINTOSH TO VERSION 2.6 FOR WINDOWS OR MS-DOS</h3>
 
<P>
The FoxPro 2.6 Transporter program has been updated to become Macintosh
aware. No special steps are necessary.
