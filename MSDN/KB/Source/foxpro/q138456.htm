<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains what Visual FoxPro Builders are and outlines some of
the points about Builders.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro Builders are tools that help you set properties for a
specific control. For example, you can use a ListBox Builder to set the
properties for a list box or a Grid Builder to set properties for a grid.
Builders facilitate the process of setting up objects with the proper set
of attributes (property values).
<P>
Builders are different from wizards in that builders are re-entrant. That
is, a builder can be used repeatedly on an object without altering or
destroying the original attributes the object possesses. For example, when
you are creating a screen that has a command button group and you decide to
add an extra command button, you can reuse the builder to do it.
<P>
Wizards, however, are not re-entrant. They are intended to be used once to
create a usable item such as a simple data entry screen. Runnning a wizard
a second time using the file name of an existing object will destroy the
original work of the same name, including any and all modifications you
made previously.
<P>
While you can edit a container object manually to add a new command button
and set its properties individually, it is usually easier to run the
builder over the CommandButton Group to add the new button. The builder
asks a series of questions about the control you are modifying and then
sets the appropriate properties to make the control work the way you want
it to work.
<P>
You can also use builders to add objects to a form, not just to modify
existing objects. If you want to add a new text box to a form, the builder
will ask a series of questions to help define the object's attributes. When
you finish the definition, the builder adds the object to the form.
<P>
Builders can be started in two ways. You can click the Builder button on
the Properties window. Or you can click the Builder Lock button on the Form
Controls toolbar, and then click another button on the Controls toolbar to
both create a new control and automatically start the builder for that
control.
<P>
Visual FoxPro supports the following Builders:

<UL><LI>Text Box Builder
<LI>Edit Box Builder
<LI>Command Group Builder
<LI>Option Group Builder
<LI>Combo Box Builder
<LI>List Box Builder
<LI>Grid Builder
<LI>Form Builder - AutoFormat Builder - Referential Integrity Builder
<P>
</UL>To find out the specific attributes available under each builder, place the
desired object on a form, and activate the builder for the object. All
other objects not listed here (such as the Page Frame or Spinner controls)
do not have native builders. If you want to have such functionality for an
unlisted object, you can use Visual FoxPro to write your own builder for
that object.
<P>
To add a control by using a builder, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the Form Controls toolbar, click the Builder Lock button.

<P><LI>Select the control you want from the Form Controls toolbar, and drop it
   on the form.

<P><LI>Fill in the information on the builder tabs.
<P>
</OL>In summary, builders are useful and powerful tools that help take some of
the drudge work out of defining object attributes.
