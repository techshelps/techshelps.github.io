<P>
<P><h3>Visual FoxPro and Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running Windows NT, Visual FoxPro 3.0b requires version 3.51.
For Windows NT 3.51 upgrade information, contact Microsoft.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Visual FoxPro from 3.5-inch Disks</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot install Visual FoxPro by copying the floppy disk files to your
hard disk. With the exception of the Setup disk (Disk 1), Visual FoxPro
disks use a format called DMF (Distribution Media Format). DMF increases
the capacity of a 3.5-inch disk, reducing the number of disks needed to
install your application, thus speeding the installation process. Because
DMF is a new format, many existing utilities such as Norton Disk Doctor,
Microsoft ScanDisk, MS-DOS DiskCopy, and Microsoft Windows Copy Disk don't
recognize DMF.
<P>
CAUTION: Do not use disk utilities to examine a DMF-formatted disk. These
utilities can corrupt the DMF disk. You cannot copy DMF-formatted disks
using MS-DOS DiskCopy or Microsoft Windows Copy Disk.
<P>
To copy the Visual FoxPro disks onto a network server or other permanent
storage drive, use the copy switch (/C) with the EXTRACT.EXE utility on
Disk 1.
<P>
- To copy the Visual FoxPro disks:
<P>
<PRE>  1. Create a directory on the target drive.

  2. Copy all the files from Disk 1 to the target directory. Disk 1 does
     not use DMF, so you can use the standard MS-DOS COPY command, as in
     this example:

     COPY A:\*.* C:\DISKS

  3. Copy the remaining disks to the directory by using the standard MS-DOS
     FOR command and the Extract.exe utility with the /C switch as shown in
     this example, issued at the A: prompt:

     FOR %I IN (*.*) DO C:\DISKS\EXTRACT /C A:\%I C:\DISKS\%I

     DMF formatting stores many files in a single cabinet (.cab) file. If
     you need only a single file that is contained in one of the cabinet
     files, you can search for the file with Extract.exe using the /D
     switch. Once you find the file, you can use Extract.exe again to copy
     the file to the desired location. You can also type EXTRACT /? to get
     help on the EXTRACT command options.

</PRE>- To list all files in a cabinet file:
<P>
<PRE>  Use EXTRACT.EXE with the /D switch as in this example:

     EXTRACT /D A:\vfp1.cab

</PRE>- To list a set of files in a cabinet file:
<P>
<PRE>  Use EXTRACT.EXE with the /D switch and wildcards. This example displays
  all .EXE files:

     EXTRACT /D A:\vfp1.cab *.EXE

</PRE>- To extract a file to the current directory:
<P>
<PRE>  Use EXTRACT.EXE without any switches as in this example:

     EXTRACT A:\vfp1.cab ANY.EXE

</PRE>- To extract a file to a specific directory:
<P>
<PRE>  Use EXTRACT.EXE with the /L switch as follows:

     EXTRACT A:\vfp1.cab /L C:\VFP ANY.EXE

</PRE><h3>Removing Visual FoxPro from a Hard Disk</h3>
 
<P>
To remove Visual FoxPro from a hard disk in Windows for Workgroups or
Windows NT, double-click the Setup icon in the Visual FoxPro program group,
and then choose Remove All from the Visual FoxPro Setup dialog box. This
process does not remove user files.
<P>
CAUTION: Though the removal procedure offers several opportunities to keep
files or shared components, it offers no final warning before it starts to
delete all Visual FoxPro files. Press ESC to stop the removal process.
<P>
- To remove Visual FoxPro from a hard disk in Windows 95:
<P>
<PRE>  1. Open the Control Panel and double-click Add/Remove Programs. The
     Add/Remove Programs Properties dialog box appears.

  2. Click the Install/Uninstall tab.

  3. Select Visual FoxPro from the list.

  4. Click Add/Remove.

  The Visual FoxPro Setup dialog box is displayed. Choose Remove All to
  remove Visual FoxPro from your hard disk. This process does not remove
  user files.

</PRE><h3>Running Network Versions of Visual FoxPro</h3>
 
<P>
Do not run Visual FoxPro from the directory created when you choose the
Visual FoxPro Network Administrative installation option (SETUP /A).
Because the Network Administrative installation option does not register
Visual FoxPro on the computer containing the central Visual FoxPro
directory; Visual FoxPro should not be run from this directory. The Network
Administrative installation option creates a central Visual FoxPro
directory on a server. From this central directory you can install Visual
FoxPro on network workstations.
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to Documentation</h3>
 
<P>
Language Reference, RIGHTC( ) Function
Remove the first paragraph in the Remarks section.
<P>
Developer's Guide, Chapter 2: Overview of the Language
Page 41  Add the following sentence to the end of the third bulleted item:
<P>
Field names in database tables are limited to 128 characters.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Visual FoxPro Files</h3>
 
<P>
To find more information about Visual FoxPro sample files that demonstrate
the new and extended capabilities of Visual FoxPro, choose the Samples
button in Help. If you want to rebuild the main sample program, Tasmanian
Traders, first set the default directory to the Samples\Mainsamp
subdirectory of the Visual FoxPro directory. Otherwise, Visual FoxPro will
not find the necessary Include subdirectory and files.
<P>
<P><h3>Developer Roadmap</h3>
 
<P>
If you have Visual FoxPro on CD-ROM compact disc, you can gain access to
the Microsoft Roadmap to Developer Products and Services. The Roadmap has
information about Microsoft developer strategies, development tools,
databases, operating system standards and specifications, and developer
programs and services. It also includes the latest information and
demonstrations of Microsoft Developer products, including specific
information about Visual FoxPro version 3.0b for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>New 3.0b Features</h2>
 
<P>
Enhanced OLE Control Support
DBCS Overview
New DBCS Functions
New Collation Sequences
New 3.0b Functions, Properties, and Methods
New Files Installed in 3.0b
Files Updated in 3.0b
Files No Longer Installed in 3.0b
<P>
<P><h3>Enhanced OLE Control Support</h3>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro 3.0b now includes support for all functionality required of a
container in the OLE Controls and Control Containers Guidelines version
1.0. This functionally includes support for the following:

<UL><LI>Embedded objects from in-process servers
<LI>In-place activation
<LI>Inside-out activation
<LI>OLEMISC_ACTIVATEWHENVISIBLE
<LI>All interfaces listed under Required Interfaces
<LI>All status bits listed under Misc and Status Bits Support
<LI>All functionality required under Keyboard Handling
<LI>IPersistStorage
<LI>All properties listed under Ambient Properties
<LI>The Align extender property
<P>
</UL>Note that Visual FoxPro 3.0b does not support IPersistStream, message
reflection, or automatic clipping, nor does it expose an extender control.
<P>
<P><h3>DBCS Overview</h3>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro 3.0b features new support for DBCS (double-byte character
sets), character sets that require more than one byte to represent a
character. Some examples of languages that require a double-byte character
set are Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.
Visual FoxPro DBCS support allows you to create international applications.
For example, you can create a Japanese application with a U.S. version of
Visual FoxPro 3.0b if you are running the Japanese version of Windows. The
Visual FoxPro DBCS functions operate properly on the Japanese character
set, and the Japanese collation sequence is supported. Visual FoxPro 3.0b
includes new functions for manipulating character expressions containing
any combination of single-byte or double-byte characters. For more
information about the new functions in Visual FoxPro 3.0b, see New DBCS
Functions. Note that system capacities have not been increased in Visual
FoxPro 3.0b to accommodate double-byte characters. The use of double-byte
characters in field names, index expressions, memory variable names, window
names, and so on reduces their length. For example, a field name can be up
to 10 bytes long in a free table, so a field name can consist of ten single-
byte characters, but only five double-byte characters. For additional
information about Visual FoxPro system capacities, search for "system
capacities" in Help.
<P>
<P><h3>New DBCS Functions</h3>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro 3.0b includes the following new DBCS functions. For more
information, see Visual FoxPro Help.
<P>
<PRE>AT_C( ) Function          ATCC( ) Function
CHRTRANC( ) Function      IMESTATUS( ) Function
ISLEADBYTE( ) Function    LEFTC( ) Function
LENC( ) Function          LIKEC( ) Function
RATC( ) Function          RIGHTC( ) Function
STRCONV( ) Function       STUFFC( ) Function
</PRE>SUBSTRC( ) Function
<P>
CAUTION: The Visual FoxPro 3.0b DBCS functions are not supported in Visual
FoxPro 3.0 and might cause unpredictable results. If you use any DBCS
functions in your application, use VERSION(1) to verify that the Visual
FoxPro version is greater than 3.0.
<P>
Note that Visual FoxPro 3.0b applications (such as the wizards and the
sample applications) contain DBCS functions and cannot be run in Visual
FoxPro 3.0. Though the Visual FoxPro 3.0b version of Genmenu.prg contains
DBCS functions, it has been modified so it can be run in Visual FoxPro 3.0
if necessary. For information, see Running GENMENU in Visual FoxPro 3.0.
<P>
<P><h3>New Collation Sequences</h3>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro supports new collation sequences for Simplified Chinese,
Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Collation sequences allow you to
properly order character fields in tables for each language. For more
information about specifying collation sequences, search for SET COLLATE in
Help. The following table lists the new Visual FoxPro 3.0b collation
sequence options and the corresponding language.
<P>
<PRE>Option      Language
JAPANESE    Japanese
KOREAN      Korean
PINYIN      Simplified Chinese
STROKE      Simplified and Traditional Chinese

</PRE><h3>New 3.0b Functions, Properties, and Methods</h3>
 
<P>
The following functions, properties, and methods have been added in Visual
FoxPro 3.0b. For more information, see Visual FoxPro Help.
<P>
<PRE>Align Property                        DefOLELCID Property
GETPEM( ) Function                    OLELCID Property

<P>
Upgrading FoxPro 2.6 Files
Using dBASE Files in Visual FoxPro
Upgrading to Windows 95
Improving Network Performance
Troubleshooting Printing Problems with the HPPCL5E Printer Driver
Running GENMENU in Visual FoxPro 3.0
Controlling Warning Messages in Views
<P>
<P><h3>Upgrading FoxPro 2.6 Files</h3>
 
<P>
When you convert FoxPro 2.6 files to Visual FoxPro, make sure that the
files are not read-only. For more information on upgrading your FoxPro 2.6
files to Visual FoxPro, search for "upgrading" in Help.
<P>
<P><h3>Using dBASE Files in Visual FoxPro</h3>
 
<P>
To find information about using your dBASE files in Visual FoxPro, search
for "Switching from dBASE" in Help.
<P>
<P><h3>Upgrading to Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
If you install Visual FoxPro on your current Window 3.1 or Windows for
Workgroups platform and then want to upgrade to Windows 95, remove Visual
FoxPro from your hard disk, upgrade to Windows 95, and then reinstall
Visual FoxPro to insure that the maintenance mode of Setup works properly.
Two additional OLE controls, Msmapi32.ocx and Mscomm32.ocx, available only
in Windows 95, will also be installed. When you open Visual FoxPro Help for
the first time in Windows 95, there is a delay while the Help index is
generated. This index enables full-text search and is generated only the
first time you open Help.
<P>
<P><h3>Improving Network Performance</h3>
 
<P>
Increasing the size of the network packet for a connection can greatly
improve performance on a network, especially on a slow or busy network. The
size of the network packet for a connection can be set with DBSETPROP( )
and SQLSETPROP( ). Note that the network packet size may be limited by the
network and the ODBC driver. For more information, see the Visual FoxPro
help file.
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting Printing Problems with the HPPCL5E Printer Driver</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the Hewlett Packard HPPCL5E version 1.2 printer driver and
receive "Printer not ready" errors when attempting to print from within
Visual FoxPro, you should upgrade to the latest version of this driver. The
latest version of the HPPCL5E printer driver is included in Windows 95 and
Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h3>Running GENMENU in Visual FoxPro 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
The latest version of Genmenu.prg, included in Visual FoxPro 3.0b, contains
DBCS functions. However, the 3.0b version of Genmenu.prg can be run in
Visual FoxPro 3.0.
<P>
To run the 3.0b version of Genmenu.prg in Visual FoxPro 3.0:

<OL><P><LI>Open the 3.0b version of Genmenu.prg.

<P><LI>Search for the line containing the text "VFP 3.0" and follow the
   instructions on that line.

<P><LI>Save the program, and recompile it in Visual FoxPro 3.0.
<P>
</OL><h3>Controlling Warning Messages in Views</h3>
 
<P>
You can control the display of warning messages when you use local and
remote views.
<P>
To control the display of warning messages in views, use SET NOTIFY ON and
SET NOTIFY OFF.
<P>
<P><h2>USING VISUAL FOXPRO</h2>
 
<P>
Accessing the Visual FoxPro Command window
Using Small Icons with Visual FoxPro
Using Delimiters in Views
Identifying Tables on a Network
Using TABLEUPDATE( ) with Views
Navigating Appended Records in Table Buffers
Creating Remote Views Using a Visual FoxPro Data Source
Using Novell Drivers to Connect to SQL Server
Using Windows Named "SCREEN"
Using CLEAR READ with READ DEACTIVATE
Printing MS-DOS Reports and Labels from Visual FoxPro
Window Access in Localized Versions of Visual FoxPro
Localized Return Values for SYS( ) Functions
Using SEEK with SET COLLATE
<P>
<P><h3>Accessing the Visual FoxPro Command window</h3>
 
<P>
If the Command window is hidden when you start Visual FoxPro, you can still
gain access to it. When you start Visual FoxPro, a Project Manager window
appears by default. If the Project Manager window fills most of your screen
(typical on smaller monitors), it might be covering the Command window. To
gain access to the Command window, choose Command window from the Window
menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Small Icons with Visual FoxPro</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 can display small icons in the Explorer and the Start menu. You
can use ImagEdit to create small icons for your Visual FoxPro applications
running under Windows 95. ImagEdit is included in the Professional Edition
of Visual FoxPro. Small icons are created by specifying the Small Icon
16-color 16x16 option when creating a new icon in ImagEdit. If this option
is not available when you create a new icon, add the following lines to the
IMAGEDIT.INI file located in your Windows directory:
<P>
<PRE>   [ImagEdit.Icon]
   Small Icon=16,16,16

</PRE></OL><h3>Using Delimiters in Views</h3>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro accepts ', ", and [ ] as delimiters. You can include spaces
in delimited identifiers for table names in local views, but not for column
names. Delimited and undelimited identifiers are not equivalent.
<P>
<P><h3>Identifying Tables on a Network</h3>
 
<P>
To specify the location of data, you can use a logical drive path. To
insure consistent access to data on a network, use the same syntax when
creating and accessing databases and tables.
<P>
<P><h3>Using TABLEUPDATE( ) with Views</h3>
 
<P>
If you use TABLEUPDATE( ) with a blank appended record in a view (a record
created using the APPEND BLANK command), the update will fail. For a valid
update in a view, you must enter data in at least one of the fields marked
as updatable before you issue the TABLEUPDATE( ) command.
<P>
<P><h3>Navigating Appended Records in Table Buffers</h3>
 
<P>
To move the record pointer to appended records in a table buffer, use the
GO command with a negative value. The RECNO( ) function returns sequential
ascending negative numbers on records appended in a table buffer. For more
information, search in Help for "records, deleting," then choose "Appending
and Deleting Records in Table Buffers."
<P>
<P><h3>Creating Remote Views Using a Visual FoxPro Data Source</h3>
 
<P>
When you create a remote view using Visual FoxPro as the data source, the
current ODBC driver recognizes only files from FoxPro version 2.6 and
earlier.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Novell Drivers to Connect to SQL Server</h3>
 
<P>
To connect to SQL Server using Novell real-mode drivers, include the
following command before establishing the connection:
<P>
<PRE>   =SQLSETPROP(0, 'PacketSize', 512)

</PRE>Using Windows Named "SCREEN"
 
<P>
In Visual FoxPro, window functions can return ambiguous values for windows
whose name contains SCREEN. For best results, avoid using SCREEN as part of
a window name. The following functions are affected by this behavior:
<P>
<PRE>WBORDER( )    WLAST( )      WONTOP( )
WCHILD( )     WLCOL( )      WROWS( )
WCOLS( )      WLROW( )      WTITLE( )
WEXIST( )     WMAXIMUM( )   WVISIBLE( )
WFONT( )      WMINIMUM( )

</PRE><h3>Using CLEAR READ with READ DEACTIVATE</h3>
 
<P>
If you use CLEAR READ within a READ DEACTIVATE clause, Visual FoxPro,
unlike FoxPro 2.6, invokes a READ VALID event. You can restore FoxPro 2.6
behavior by removing CLEAR READ and returning true (.T.).
<P>
<P><h3>Printing MS-DOS Reports and Labels from Visual FoxPro</h3>
 
<P>
Printing character-based reports or labels (created in FoxPro for MS-DOS)
in Visual FoxPro can produce unexpected results. This method writes
directly to the printer and is not recommended on the Windows platform. If
you use the PDSETUP clause with REPORT and LABEL commands, you will have
more reliable results on the Windows platform by converting to Visual
FoxPro format. For more information about the effects of the PDSETUP
clause, see _PDSETUP in Help.
<P>
<P><h3>Window Access in Localized Versions of Visual FoxPro</h3>
 
<P>
In localized versions of Visual FoxPro, specify Visual FoxPro windows, such
as the Command window, Debug window, Trace window, or View window by their
English names; specify toolbars by their localized names (the name that
appears in the title bar of the toolbar window).
<P>
<P><h3>Localized Return Values for SYS( ) Functions</h3>
 
<P>
In localized versions of Visual FoxPro, the SYS( ) functions SYS(2006) and
SYS(2011) return localized values.
<P>
<P><h3>Using SEEK with SET COLLATE</h3>
 
<P>
If you perform a SEEK when SET COLLATE is not set to MACHINE, the seek
fails if the index key contains a trailing blank. Trailing blanks are valid
only if SET COLLATE is set to MACHINE.
<P>
<P><h2>USING ODBC AND OLE IN VISUAL FOXPRO</h2>
 
<P>
Using ODBC Desktop Drivers
Avoiding ODBC Errors in the Remote View Wizard
MS Draw 1.0 Objects as Visual FoxPro OLE Objects
<P>
<P><h3>Using ODBC Desktop Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
The ODBC drivers and driver manager installed in Visual FoxPro 3.0b are the
most current versions. Some of the files installed may conflict with ODBC
2.5 components installed by other software. Avoid using DECLARE - DLL,
FoxTools, or an .fll file to gain access to ODBC drivers. Doing so can
generate errors; use SQLCONNECT( ), SQLEXEC( ), or other Visual FoxPro
functions to connect to ODBC.
<P>
<P><h3>Avoiding ODBC Errors in the Remote View Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the Remote View Wizard with backend servers that assign table
ownership, such as SQL Server, you must select tables that you own or that
have a public owner. To access data from any other table, use the View
Designer.
<P>
<P><h3>MS Draw 1.0 Objects as Visual FoxPro OLE Objects</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running Visual FoxPro under Windows 3.1 or Windows for
Workgroups, Microsoft Draw 1.0 objects are not supported as Visual FoxPro
OLE objects.
<P>
