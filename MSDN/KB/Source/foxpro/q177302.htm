<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: The information in this article has not been confirmed or tested
by Microsoft. Some or all of the information in this article has been taken
from unconfirmed customer reports. ANY USE BY YOU OF THE INFORMATION
PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this
information "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or
implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of
merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose.
<P>
Both FoxPro and Visual FoxPro may produce memory related error messages
when you run them on the new Macintosh OS 8 software. These errors may
occur at any point in the usage of either the development version of FoxPro
or within a compiled application. Since both Microsoft FoxPro 2.6a for the
Macintosh and Visual FoxPro for the Macintosh 3.0b were designed to run on
Apple OS 7.x systems, Microsoft cannot guarantee the either product will
operate successfully on OS 8. However, some users have been able to run
FoxPro and Visual FoxPro on OS 8 systems.
<P>
Listed below are some suggested troubleshooting steps to take if memory
related errors appear while running under OS 8.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are a list of steps you may use in troubleshooting memory
problems under OS 8. The suggestions provided below may not work in all
situations. Often, the suggestions need to be cumulatively applied to the
computer. Please note that these suggestions have helped some users.
However, these steps do not correct all problems. If these steps do not
provide the user with a stable system, you may have to run FoxPro or Visual
FoxPro on a computer with a version of System 7.x.
<P>
Microsoft does not support, endorse, or recommend any of these products. We
provide this information only as a convenience for our customers and do not
provide warranties of any kind, either expressed or implied, including but
not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for
a particular purpose.

<OL><P><LI>Reduce the number of colors the monitor uses to either thousands or 256.
   This frees up memory.

<P><LI>Turn off the virtual memory on the machine. If it already off, turn it
   on. Start with virtual memory set to 1 MB more than the amount of
   physical RAM. If this does not help, try increasing the amount of
   virtual memory. Conversely, if virtual memory is already set to a large
   value, try reducing the amount available.

<P><LI>If you are using a CoStar AddressWriter printer, remove the driver. We
   have received unconfirmed reports that version 2.1 of the AddressWriter
   printer driver causes conflicts.

<P><LI>Remove the FoxPro Settings file from the Preferences folder and restart
   FoxPro.

<P><LI>Remove the extensions Foxtools.cfm, on Visual FoxPro for the Macintosh,
   or Foxtools.mlb in FoxPro 2.6, and Foxdoc.mlb from the System's
   Extension folder. After removing these files, restart the machine and
   start FoxPro.

<P><LI>Try increasing or decreasing the amount of disk cache used on the
   computer. This setting is found in Control Panel under Memory.

<P><LI>If you are running a PPC application on a Power Macintosh machine and
   memory errors occur, try making a 68K version of the application. While
   this application may prove slower, it may help solve the memory
   conflict.

<P><LI>Rebuild the desktop and remove any desktop pictures or patterns.

<P><LI>Try turning off file sharing.

<P><LI>If FoxPro is running over a network, try running it locally and see if
<P><PRE>    the network is causing the problem.
</PRE>
<P><LI>The default font used in FoxPro is Geneva. If this font becomes
<P><PRE>    corrupted, errors may occur. To replace this font, remove it from the
    System's Font folder and copy the Geneva font file from the System
    disks to that location.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove the OpenDoc files from System Folder\Editors\OpenDoc folder
<P><PRE>    and place these files in a temporary folder you create on your
    desktop. After you restart the computer, start FoxPro. If this does not
    solve the problem copy the files back from the temporary folder.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Instant Organizer from Claris has been reported to cause menu
<P><PRE>    corruption with FoxPro. This may not be limited to OS 8 and may occur
    in system software versions prior to OS 8.
</PRE><P>

Several other features of both FoxPro 2.6a and Visual FoxPro either behave
differently or do not function at all under OS 8. For additional
