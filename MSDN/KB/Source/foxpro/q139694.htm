<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists the wizards that are available in Visual FoxPro along
with a brief description of each. Wizards are interactive programs that
help you quickly accomplish common tasks, such as creating forms,
formatting reports, and setting up queries.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Visual FoxPro contains the original wizards as well as new ones. Each
Wizard and its associated functions are listed below.

The Cross-Tab Wizard creates a cross-tab query for displaying the results
of a query in a spreadsheet format. The wizard prompts you with simple
questions as you go through a brief series of steps in which you specify
the databases, tables, and fields that you want to use in your Cross-Tab
query.
<P>
<P><h3>Form Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The Form Wizard creates a form for data entry from a single table. The
wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through a brief series
of steps in which you specify the table and fields you want to use to
create controls that appear on your form. The size of the form is based on
your Maximum Design Area setting on the Forms tab of the Options dialog
box.
<P>
<P><h3>Graph Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The Graph Wizard creates a graph from a Visual FoxPro table using Microsoft
Graph. The wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through a
brief series of steps in which you specify the table and fields that you
want to use in your graph.
<P>
<P><h3>Group/Total Report Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The Group/Total Report Wizard creates a summary report. The wizard prompts
you with simple questions and creates the expressions that group your data.
<P>
<P><h3>Import Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The Import Wizard imports data into Visual FoxPro tables from other file
formats. The wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through a
brief series of steps in which you specify a source file and whether you
want to create a new file or append the data to an existing file.
<P>
<P><h3>Label Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The Label Wizard creates labels from a table. The wizard prompts you with

specify the table and fields that you want to use to create controls on
your report.

you with simple questions as you go through a brief series of steps in
which you specify the databases, tables, and fields that you want to use in
your view. You must have an existing database in which to store your view.

tables. The wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through a
brief series of steps in which you specify the tables and fields that you

<P><h3>One-to-Many Report Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The One-to-Many Report Wizard creates a report that groups records from a
parent table with records from a child table. The wizard prompts you with

existing tables. You can choose either to save the pivot table directly in
Microsoft Excel or to add the pivot table as an embedded object on a form.
<P>
<P><h3>Query Wizard</h3>

The Query Wizard creates queries. The wizard prompts you with simple
questions as you go through a brief series of steps in which you specify
the databases, tables, and fields that you want to use in your query.

in your view. You must have an existing database in which to store your
view and an existing data source or connection.

select a table that fits your needs from the list of sample tables. You

saved the table.

FoxPro only.

a brief series of steps.
<P>
<P><h3>Setup Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The Setup Wizard creates distribution disks from the files in your
distribution tree. To learn about the distribution process and how to
