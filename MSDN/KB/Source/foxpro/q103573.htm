The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are creating a cursor from a simple SELECT command and then
selecting from the cursor into another cursor and DELETED is SET to
OFF, FoxPro will generate the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   'cursor name' must be created with SELECT ... INTO TABLE

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
See the "More Information" section below for an illustration of the
situation and an explanation of why this behavior occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
When DELETED is SET to ON, this error does not occur.
<P>
NOTE: If an index tag for DELETED() exists in the database, the error
message will still be displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. However, the documentation on the SELECT
command states only that a SELECT command may be taken FROM an alias.
The documentation does not mention that there are times when this
operation will not work.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following code illustrates this situation:
<P>
<PRE>   SET DELETED OFF
   SET DEFAULT TO C:\FOXPROW\TUTORIAL
   SELECT * FROM Customer INTO CURSOR Cust1
   ?DBF()                                      &amp;&amp; this should point to
                                               &amp;&amp; CUSTOMER in TUTORIAL

   SELECT * FROM Cust1 INTO CURSOR Cust2       &amp;&amp; this should generate
                                               &amp;&amp; the error

   CLOSE ALL
   SET DELETED ON                              &amp;&amp; this changes things
   SELECT * FROM Customer INTO CURSOR Cust1
   ?DBF()                                      &amp;&amp; this should now point
                                               &amp;&amp; to a .TMP file

   SELECT * FROM Cust1 INTO CURSOR Cust2       &amp;&amp; this should work now
                                               &amp;&amp; giving us Cust2

</PRE>The SET DELETED ON command forces FoxPro to create a .TMP file rather
than just point to the original file even if there are no fields in
CUSTOMER that are marked for deletion. (This behavior would also occur
if the SELECT command creating Cust1 were more restrictive.) The
simple SELECT command in the above code fragment just causes FoxPro to
use CUSTOMER again; since the SELECT * FROM Customer command
represents the entire CUSTOMER table, FoxPro saves time by not really
performing the SELECT command.
