The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You attempt to change the WindowType of a running form from modeless to
modal and then back to modeless. On the switch from modeless to modal, you
succeed. But the attempt to switch the now modal form to modeless fails.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Although there isn't much call to do this at run time, the switch is one
way only. There is no way to programmatically change it back.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The WindowType of a form should be a property you set a design time; not
run time.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new form, and set the form's WindowType property to Modeless.

<P><LI>Place a command button on the form. In the Click method, add the
   following line of code:
<P>
   THISFORM.SHOW(1)

<P><LI>Change the Caption property to Modal. Place a second command button on
   the form, and add the following code to its Click event:
<P>
   THISFORM.SHOW(2)

<P><LI>Change the Caption property to Modeless. Place a third command button on
   the form. Change its Caption property to Release, and add the following
   code to its Click event:
<P>
   THISFORM.RELEASE

<P><LI>Run the form. If you click the Release command button, the form closes
   as expected. If you click the Modal command button, the form becomes
   modal. You may test this by trying to click outside of the form and
   noting you are unable to activate anything outside of the form or access
   any other part of the Windows interface. If you then click the Modeless
   command button, the form does not return to a modeless WindowType. The
   form remains modal. The Release command button does not release the
   form. You must cancel the program to exit.
