The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, and 2.5a
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5 and 2.5a

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
FoxPro automatically locks the record in the currently selected
database as well as any related records in other work areas that are
involved in a READ command. You can bypass the automatic record
locking by using the READ NOLOCK command. Using this command may
result in improved network performance when you are skipping through a
database file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Issuing a READ NOLOCK command bypasses automatic record locking. The
record is displayed and the GET fields are enabled, but are read-only.
Any controls, such as buttons, that use a field are disabled and
cannot be chosen.
<P>
The record cannot be edited until SHOW GETS LOCK, LOCK(), or RLOCK()
is issued. The record cannot be locked by using the shortcut key
combination CTRL+O.
<P>
Issuing SHOW GETS without the LOCK clause will not allow the record to
be locked, because SHOW GETS assumes the locking behavior of the READ
command itself. Since the READ command has the NOLOCK clause, SHOW
GETS will not lock the record.
<P>
SHOW GETS LOCK, LOCK(), and RLOCK() all attempt to lock the record in
the current work area. SHOW GETS LOCK attempts to lock related records
in other work areas as well. LOCK() and RLOCK() do not attempt to lock
related records. If the record is locked by another user, FoxPro will
return error 109.
<P>
If SET MULTILOCKS is OFF, the record lock will automatically be
released when the record pointer is moved off the current record. If
SET MULTILOCKS is ON, the record lock will not be released until the
database is closed, the user exits FoxPro, or an UNLOCK command is
issued.
<P>
To enable READ NOLOCK, SET EXCLUSIVE must be OFF.
<P>
To issue a READ NOLOCK command for a screen created through the FoxPro
screen generator, check the READ NOLOCK check box in the generator
options dialog box.
