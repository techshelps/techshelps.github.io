The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0 and 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A problem occurs when a class based on form is used as a template to design
a new form. Although within the class the Desktop property of the form is
set to 'False - .F.' (default), during design time, the new form based on
this class is assigned a Desktop Property of 'True - .T.' so the form
doesn't run as a Desktop form.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Set the form's template class to the value that will be used in the
finished form. It is not necessary for this to be done at the bottom level
of the class hierarchy (that is, the ParentClass Property of the template
class is 'Form'), but simply within the template class itself.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in
Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Changing the Desktop Property of a form to a setting different from the
ParentClass will take effect in one of the following scenarios:

<UL><LI>The ParentClass of the form is 'Form.'
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The form is saved as a class and used as a template for yet another form
   that is intended to have the Desktop Property of the class from which
   it was created.
<P>
</UL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new form, set its Desktop Property to 'True - .T.', and save
   the form as a class.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Forms tab. Set the
   Template Class to the class created in Step 1.

<P><LI>Create a new form, and set its Desktop Property to 'False - .F.'.

<P><LI>Save and close the form, and then use the DO FORM command to run the
   form.

<P><LI>Resize the main Visual FoxPro Window such that the Windows Desktop can
   be seen behind it. If its Desktop Property is false (as it was set in
   Step 3), you should not be able to drag the form out of the main Visual
   FoxPro window. However, you should be able to drag the form onto the
   Windows Desktop.

<P><LI>Close the form, and re-open it in the Form Designer. Choose Save as
   Class, and save it as a different class.

<P><LI>Repeat Steps 2 through 5 implementing the following changes:
<P>
   a. In Step 2, set the Template Class to the class created in Step 6.
<P>
   b. In Step 3, note that its Desktop Property is already 'False - .F.'.
<P>
   c. In Step 5, note that the form may not be dragged outside the main
<P><PRE>      Visual FoxPro Window.
