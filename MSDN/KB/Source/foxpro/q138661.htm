The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If the AS clause is used to rename a field in the Query or View designer,
it will be lost when the Query or View is reopened. As long as the Query or
View is created and saved, the AS clause remains and works correctly. If
the Query or View is modified, then the AS clause will disappear.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
A query can be created with FoxPro's SELECT - SQL statement. The following
example will create a query.
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT &lt;tablename.fieldname&gt; AS custom_name FROM ;
       &lt;tablename&gt; INTO CURSOR queryname

</PRE>A view can be created with FoxPro's CREATE SQL VIEW statement. The
following example will create a local view.
<P>
<PRE>   CREATE SQL VIEW mysqlview AS SELECT &lt;tablename.fieldname&gt; AS ;
       custom_name FROM &lt;database container.tablename&gt;

</PRE>Instead of opening the Query or View designer and losing the AS clause, the
code can be changed in a .prg file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the Query or View designer, a field can be assigned another name using
the AS clause. This is done under the Fields tab in the
Functions/Expressions box. Typing the field name and adding the AS clause
with a name after it gives the field the name that follows the AS clause.
For example,
<P>
<PRE>   customer.cust_id AS Customer_Id

</PRE>gives the field customer.cust_id the name of Customer_Id when browsed.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
Creating a Query:

<OL><P><LI>Select the File menu pad and choose New. Click the Query radio button
   and choose the New File button. Select a table from the "Add Table
   or View" window.

<P><LI>Choose the Fields tab and type the name of a field from the table in the
   Functions/Expressions box, followed by "AS custom_name" (without
   the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Click the Add button to place the expression In the Selected Output
   box.

<P><LI>Run the query,  and note that the field has the title of "custom_name."
   Save and close the query after giving it a name. Reopen the query and
   choose the Fields tab. Note that the field in the Selected Output box no
   longer contains the AS clause.
<P>
</OL>Creating a View:

<OL><P><LI>A database container must be open to create a view and it has to be
   opened exclusively. So, make sure Exclusive is on by typing "SET
   EXCLUSIVE ON (without the quotation marks) in the Command window. Then,
   open a database container.

<P><LI>From the File menu, click New. Click the View radio button, and then
   click the New File button. Select a table from the "Add Table or View"
   window.

<P><LI>Click the Fields tab and type the name of a field from the table in the
   Functions/Expressions box, followed by "AS custom_name" (without
   the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Click the Add button to place the expression In the Selected Output
   box.

<P><LI>Run the view and note that the field has the title of "custom_name."
   Save and close the view after giving it a name. Reopen the view and
   click the Fields tab. Note that the field in the Selected Output box
   no longer contains the AS clause.
