<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the Help file or reference manual for the Paint event, it says that the
Paint event will fire when part or all of a form or toolbar is exposed
after it has been moved or sized -- or after a window that was covering the
form or toolbar has been moved.
<P>
This is true, but the Paint event also fires at other times, such as when a
value of an object changes or when moving the cursor from one object to
another object on the form. With this in mind, you should be aware of the
consequences of certain code that is placed in the Paint event.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Paint event is an event of the form and is useful for checking the
status of objects, forms, variables, or a toolbar. It is wise to not place
any code in the Paint event that would affect the size or appearance of any
objects or properties. Changing the caption of an object or changing the
value of an object on a form would be examples of code that would make the
form act strange.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a form and add a new property for the form. On the Form menu,
   click New Property, and in the Name box, type:
<P>
   numcount
<P>
   In the Properties sheet under the Other tab, scroll to the bottom, and
   change the .F. beside the numcount property to the numeric value of 1.

<P><LI>Add a text box to the form.

<P><LI>In the Paint event of the form, add the following code:
<P>
   THISFORM.NUMCOUNT = THISFORM.NUMCOUNT + 1
   THISFORM.TEXT1.VALUE = STR(THISFORM.NUMCOUNT)

<P><LI>Run the form. Note that the text box is being constantly updated with a
   new number. This is because the Paint event is being called repeatedly.
   Every time the value of the text box is changed in Paint event, the
   Paint event is called again because it sees that the value of an object
   in the form has changed.
<P></OL>
