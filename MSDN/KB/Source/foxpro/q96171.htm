</PRE><P><LI> Q. Can I create a FoxPro for Windows application using FoxPro for
<P><PRE>       MS-DOS as my development platform?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Applications created with FoxPro for MS-DOS can be executed by
       FoxPro for Windows without making any changes. However, the
       FoxPro for MS-DOS power tools do not support features specific
       to the Windows environment.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       While it is possible to manually code in these features, we
       don't recommend this approach to cross-platform application
       development because the code will be very specific and
       therefore not very portable. Instead, we recommend using the
       power tools provided with FoxPro for Windows.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I have an existing FoxPro version 2.0 project. How do I make it run
<P><PRE>       in FoxPro version 2.5?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. You need only open the project in FoxPro version 2.5 and rebuild
       your application. Screens and reports will need to be converted only
       if you decide to modify them.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Will I be able to create executables for FoxPro version 2.5?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. The options for building .EXE files in FoxPro version 2.5 for
       MS-DOS are the same as they are in FoxPro version 2.0. In FoxPro
       version 2.0, you can build stand-alone and/or compact .EXE files.
       Compact .EXE files are distributed with library files included in
       the FoxPro Distribution Kit. Stand-alone .EXE files do not require
       the FoxPro library files. The information from the libraries is
       built into a stand-alone .EXE file.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       In FoxPro for Windows, you can create the equivalent of the
       compact .EXE file. These files are distributed with the library
       files included in the FoxPro for Windows Distribution Kit.
