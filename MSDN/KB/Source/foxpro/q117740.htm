The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a brief overview of FoxPro for Windows, along with
tips for setting up and configuring FoxPro.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>What Is FoxPro?</h3>
 
<P>
FoxPro is a very powerful development tool for creating relational database
management systems (RDBMSs). An RDBMS is a set of data files, screens,
query tools, and reports used to track the flow of a data process. The
FoxPro programming language is based on a programming language called
xBase.
<P>
The keys to the successful use of FoxPro are:

<UL><LI>Becoming familiar with the environment needed to run FoxPro
<LI>Learning the many levels of the FoxPro interface
<LI>Learning some basic programming techniques and commands
<P>
</UL>Any experience you have with these areas will dramatically increase your
ability to use FoxPro. But if you don't have any, don't worry! We all have
to start somewhere, and the best place to start is to prepare a working
environment with all the necessary tools.
<P>
<P><h3>FoxPro Product Materials</h3>
 
<P>
Three key items are shipped in the FoxPro package; make sure you have them
at hand before continuing with the setup process:

<UL><LI>The registration card (please fill it out and mail it in)
<LI>The setup disks
<LI>The manuals:
<P>
<P><PRE>     Installation and Configuration
     Master Index
     Getting Started
     User's Guide
     Developer's Guide
     Language Reference
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>Checking System Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
Once you have the materials you'll need, you need make sure that the PC
you're using is capable of running FoxPro. The FoxPro system requirements
are located on page 1-1 of the "Installation and Configuration" manual.
Make sure that all the requirements but the last one (the hard disk space)
are met before installation. (The installation program will verify whether
you have enough available disk space.)
<P>
If you need help determining whether your system meets the requirements,
you can run the Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD) program that ships with
Windows. To run this program:

<OL><P><LI>If you're running Windows, close any running applications, and then
   choose Exit from the File menu.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, type "MSD" (without the quotation marks) and then
   press the ENTER key.

<P><LI>After MSD examines your system, it displays a screen with the following
   information:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Computer:  The processor you're using (80386SX or higher required)
</PRE><P>
<PRE>      Memory:    The memory configuration (4 MB minimum required, 8 MB or
                 higher recommended)

      Video:     What type of monitor you have (VGA or higher resolution
                 required)

      Windows:   The Windows version (you must be able to run Windows in
                 386 enhanced mode; MSD will say "Enhanced" if you can)

                If you're not sure what mode you are running Windows in,
                start Windows and choose About Program Manager from the
                Program Manager Help menu. (NOTE: Doing this does not
                indicate what mode you're running in if you are using
                Windows for Workgroups 3.11.)

      Version:   The version and manufacturer of your operating system

      Mouse:     Which mouse driver you're using (a mouse is required)

</PRE><P><LI>Compare the MSD information with the system requirements listed in the
   "Installation and Configuration" manual.

<P><LI>To quit MSD, choose Exit from the File menu.
<P>
</OL><h3>Setting Up FoxPro</h3>
 
<P>
To install FoxPro on a single machine, follow the "Quick Setup"
instructions on page 1-1 of the "Installation and Configuration" manual.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Up a Working Environment</h3>
 
<P>
Once FoxPro has been successfully installed, you should set up a working
environment that will keep the FoxPro program files separate from the files
you will create. The best way to do this is by creating a directory in
which to store your work. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Windows and open File Manager, which is usually found in
   the Main group.

<P><LI>In File Manager, select (highlight) the hard disk and folder that
   represents the top-level (root) directory, which is indicated by a
   backslash (\).

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Create Directory.

<P><LI>In the Name box, type a name for the new directory; for example,
   FOXWORK.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button. You should now see your new directory listed in
   File Manager.
<P>
</OL>Now that you have a working directory, you need to tell FoxPro where it is
supposed to store the files you create. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>In Program Manager, select (highlight) the FoxPro icon by clicking it
   once with the mouse.

<P><LI>From the Program Manager File menu, choose Properties.
<P>
   Windows will display a dialog box that allows you to select the working
   directory and program file to run.

<P><LI>In the Working Directory box, type the path to the working directory;
   for example, C:\FOXWORK.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL><h3>Configuring FoxPro</h3>
 
<P>
Although it is not required, you can use a configuration file to specify
certain startup preferences for FoxPro. This configuration file, called
CONFIG.FPW, is similar to the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files used by MS-
DOS and the Startup group and WIN.INI file used by Microsoft Windows.
<P>
For example, when FoxPro starts, it has a default title of "Microsoft
FoxPro." You can use the CONFIG.FPW file to change the title, as well as
the default directory and many other settings. For more information about
the CONFIG.FPW file, look up "CONFIG.FPW" in the "Master Index."
<P>
<P><h3>Running FoxPro</h3>
 
<P>
To start running FoxPro, double-click the FoxPro icon in Program Manager.
<P>
<P><h3>Getting Help with FoxPro</h3>
 
<P>
With FoxPro running, you now have access to the FoxPro online Help file.
The Help file is loaded with useful information. For example, the Help file
includes such valuable topics as:
<P>
<PRE>   Troubleshooting
   Top 25 Common Issues
   Top 20 Coding Errors
   Using Wizards
   Using Catalog Manager

</PRE></OL>Note that the information in Help is more current than information in the
print documentation.
<P>
To open the Help file, press the F1 key, or choose Contents from the Help
menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Other Sources of Information</h3>
 

<UL><LI>README.TXT File: The README.TXT file in the FoxPro directory provides
   information not contained in the FoxPro online Help file or print
   documentation, and provides corrections to both. (You can easily access
   the README.TXT file by clicking the FoxPro README icon in the FoxPro
   group in Program Manager.)

<LI>PSSQA.TXT File: The PSSQA.TXT file in the FoxPro directory provides
   answers to the most commonly asked questions about FoxPro. You can
   easily access the PSSQA.TXT file by clicking the FoxPro Q&amp;A icon in the
   FoxPro group in Program Manager.)
