The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Logical fields can be represented on reports as check boxes in FoxPro for
Windows and FoxPro for Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If a logical field is simply placed in a report, the value .F. or .T. is
printed. To improve the appearance of your report, you can enter the
picture "Y" in the Format box in the Report Expression dialog box. This
will cause all false values to print as N, while all true values will print
as Y.
<P>
While this technique is certainly adequate and has been available since
FoxBASE, FoxPro for Windows and FoxPro for Macintosh offer a graphical
solution that many people find more visually attractive. Instead of using Y
and N, check boxes are used on screens to indicate individual choices that
are either turned on or off. In the case of the report, the field label
indicates the choice and the check box for each record either contains an X
to indicate that the particular option was selected or is blank to show
that the option was not selected.
<P>
<P><h3>To Create This Effect in the Report Writer</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Use the Box tool to place a small box at the appropriate location.

<P><LI>Use the Field tool to place a field on the report, and then enter and
   save the following expression in the Expression box:
<P>
<P><PRE>      IIF(.T.,"X","")
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Object menu, choose Font, and then choose Arial, 12, and Bold.

<P><LI>Drag the field over the center of the small box. Ideally, the field
   should extend slightly above and below the box equally, but the box
   should extend equally to the left and right of the field. Resize the box
   as needed to produce this effect.

<P><LI>Press CTRL+I or choose Preview from the Report menu, and verify that the
   X is centered in the box. If not, close the preview, select the field,
   and use the arrow keys to reposition the field until it is centered
   exactly.

<P><LI>Once the X is properly positioned, open the Report Expression dialog
   box, and replace the .T. in the expression with the name of the logical
   field in the database.
<P></OL>
