The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, and 2.6
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, and 2.6

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Trace window appears during program execution even though no SET STEP
ON or SET ECHO ON command was issued.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A SET VIEW TO &lt;viewfile&gt; command was issued, and ECHO was ON when the View
file was created.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure that ECHO is OFF when you create View files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the Command window, issue the following commands:
<P>
<P><PRE>      USE customer
      SET ECHO ON
      CREATE VIEW myview
</PRE>
<P><LI>Create a program with the following commands:
<P>
<P><PRE>      WAIT WINDOW "hello"
      SET VIEW TO myview
      WAIT WINDOW "good-bye"
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run the program above. Note that the Trace window appears with the
   last line of the program highlighted.
<P>
</OL>The most common use of a View file is to save a specific environment
containing information about which files are open, which indexes are in use
and what relations have been set. This information can be accessed through
the View panel of the View window.
<P>
However, the View file also saves other settings (including the current
status of SET ECHO), which are then restored with when the SET VIEW TO
command is issued. These settings can be viewed through the On/Off, Files,
and Miscellaneous panels of the View window.
<P>
Other settings saved with the View file are SET PROCEDURE and SET FIELDS.
