<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You receive an "Unable to find &lt;array name&gt;" dialog when building an
application.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When building an application, it is not uncommon to receive a warning
dialog that indicates that FoxPro was unable to find a particular program,
menu, or report. While the above mentioned are the more common items the
Project Manager has difficulty reconciling, they are also the easiest to
correct. The most deceptive unresolved reference is when the Project
Manager cannot resolve a reference to an array embedded in a report.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can usually use the EXTERNAL command to resolve the issue. However,
this is a compiler command, so it is not effective if the array that
couldn't be found is used as an expression in a report.
<P>
NOTE: For more information on the use of the EXTERNAL command, please see
the Microsoft FoxPro "Language Reference."
<P>
One way to resolve this issue is to create a dummy procedure or function
with the same name as the array called in the report. This procedure should
never be called and should have no more than a RETURN statement. However,
its existence will make the compiler quit looking for the array inside the
report. In any instance where the array name is used, the FoxPro compiler
will assume that the call is to the dummy procedure and not to an array
that exists elsewhere. This will have no effect on the compiled application
and the report will call the array as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
