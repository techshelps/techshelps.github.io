The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Associations that were specified in Windows File Manager for FoxPro files
(.PRG, .DBF, and so on) are lost after FoxPro for Windows is installed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the Setup program is run to install FoxPro, it sets file associations
automatically. It does not check for file associations that may have been
modified by the user.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
After installing FoxPro, reestablish the desired file associations by
running File Manager and then choosing Associate from the File menu.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A file is associated with an application through the filename extension and
the application's file type. Once a file is associated with an application,
you can double-click any file with the same extension in the directory
window of the File Manager to start the application and load the file.
<P>
The Setup program used to install FoxPro for Windows automatically
associates certain files (such as those with a .PRG or .DBF extension) with
FoxPro for Windows. If different associations are selected for such files
and FoxPro for Windows is then installed, the selected associations will be
lost. For example, if files with a .PRG extension are associated with
Notepad, Notepad will be invoked if a file with a .PRG extension is double-
clicked in File Manager. After FoxPro is installed, this association with
Notepad will be replaced by an association with FoxPro for Windows. Double-
clicking a file with a .PRG extension will then cause FoxPro for Windows,
rather than Notepad, to be invoked.
