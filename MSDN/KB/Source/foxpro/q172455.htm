   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE>There are two common reasons why the "Cannot Quit Visual FoxPro" error
message may be encountered. The first is that there is a READ EVENTS active
when the QUIT command is issued. The second is that there is a modal forms
active when the QUIT command is issued.
<P>
In Visual FoxPro 3.x, the QUIT command would process through a modal form
or a READ EVENTS to exit an executable. Although the error could still be
encountered, if, for instance, the application's CloseBox is clicked when a
READ EVENTS is in effect. In Visual FoxPro 5.x, the QUIT command will not
process through either a modal form or a READ EVENTS.
<P>
The sample files contained in this article both illustrate some possible
scenarios where the error message may be encountered and a way around it.
Either Visual FoxPro 5.0 or the professional version of Visual FoxPro 3.0
are needed to work with these files. Although Visual FoxPro 3.0 users will
not likely run into the error message in the situations that are
illustrated herein. The Visual FoxPro runtime libraries are not included
with the sample files. To run the executable files, the runtime libraries
must be present. The steps below will assume that Visual FoxPro 5.0,
including the support library, are on the computer in use.
<P>
To use the sample files, follow these steps.

<OL><P><LI>Place the ExitFox.exe self-extracting executable file in a new folder
   and double-click it to extract the files.

<P><LI>The following files are contained in it:
<P>
<P><PRE>      - Quitfox.pjx
      - Quitfox.pjt - These are the Visual FoxPro 5.x project files.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      - Quitfox3.pjx
      - Quitfox3.pjt - These are the Visual FoxPro 3.x project files.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      - Quitfox.exe - Sample custom exe file - Visual FoxPro 5.x.
      - Quitfox3.exe - Sample custom exe file - Visual FoxPro 3.x.
</PRE><P>
   Both projects share the following files:
<P>
<P><PRE>      - Quitfox.prg - The main program in both projects.
      - Quitfox.scx
      - Quitfox.sct - The first modal form in each project.
      - Quitfox2.scx
      - Quitfox2.sct - The second modal form in each project.
      - Quitfox.mnx
      - Quitfox.mnt - The menu files for each project.
</PRE><P>
   The forms, menu, and main program are common to each project. There are
   no version-specific settings or code in either project. The executables
   can be rebuilt in each version of Visual FoxPro as desired. Open the
   appropriate project file for the version of Visual FoxPro in use. Using
   the same files in both projects illustrates the difference in
   behavior between version 3.0 and version 5.0.

<P><LI>Run the Quitfox.exe file. It should display the Visual FoxPro screen
   with a menu containing the Quit, Do Modal Form and AllowCloseBoxExit
   options.

<P><LI>Try to close the application with the CloseBox in the upper right
   corner. The "Cannot Quit Visual FoxPro" error message should appear.
   This is because there is a READ EVENTS in effect. The same behavior will
   happen in Quitfox3.exe. The Quit menu command or F11 can be used to
   exit the application if desired. To allow the application to be
   shutdown with the CloseBox, choose the AllowCloseBoxExit menu option,
   which issues an ON SHUTDOWN CLEAR EVENTS command. Instead of issuing
   this in a menu option, it could be placed at the beginning of the main
   program in the project. Then the CloseBox could be used to exit the
   application without choosing the menu option. This can be disabled by
   setting the Closable property of _Screen to .F. as is done in the Do
   Modal Form menu option. "_Screen" is made closable again in the
   Destroy method of Modal Form #1. This is where the similarities in
   quitting the two applications end.

<P><LI>Now choose the Do Modal Form menu option. Modal Form #1 should appear.
   It can be closed with the CloseBox or the Close Form button. Try the
   Quit FoxPro button. The "Cannot Quit Visual FoxPro" error should appear.
   If running Quitfox3.exe, this will exit the application.

<P><LI>Next click the Do Another Modal Form button. Modal Form #2 should
   appear. Try closing it with the Quit FoxPro button. In Quitfox3.exe,
   this will end the application. In Quitfox.exe, it produces the error
   message. Try the Hide Modal Forms and Quit button. This hides the
   modal forms, which makes them modeless, so the QUIT command will then
   work. The form can be closed with the CloseBox in the top right corner
   if quitting is not desired.

<P><LI>With Modal Form #1 active, increase the value in the Spinner control to
   5. There is a timer control on this form. The Interval property is
   initially set to zero to disable it. With the Spinner's value set to 5,
   click on the Set Timer Interval To Spinner Value button. The timer will
   now fire in 5 seconds. The timer calls a procedure in the main program
   that releases all open forms and does a CLEAR EVENTS. The application
   should now disappear after waiting 5 seconds. As a further test, the
   second modal form can be displayed before the timer fires. The
   application will still quit. Although not needed in a Visual FoxPro 3.x
   executable, this method works there too.

<P><LI>Open the source files and examine the code and settings.
<P>
</OL>The technique employed here could easily be modified for a multi-user setup
where a table on a server holds a value that determines if the application
should be ended. The procedure that the timer calls would go out and check
that value and determine whether or not to end the application. An
administrator could set the value at night, for instance, to log out any
users who left for the day with the application running. Once all the users
are logged out, the administrator could open the application's tables
exclusively and PACK, REINDEX, or change their structure.
