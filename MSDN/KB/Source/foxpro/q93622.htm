The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, and 2.5a
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5 and 2.5a
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft FoxPro supports a READ command that does not contain any GET
clauses. It is termed a "foundation READ." A foundation READ is the
controlling READ command that has a VALID clause. The VALID clause
controls nested, or child, READ commands. The VALID clause in a
foundation READ is triggered by events that would terminate the READ
command, such as the following:

<UL><LI>CLEAR READ. In a READ command with a GET clause, the VALID clause
   is not called for a CLEAR READ command.

<LI>A key press or mouse click that does not correspond to a menu
   selection or is not listed in an ON KEY LABEL command.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A CLEAR READ invokes the READ VALID clause only on a foundation READ.
For example, consider an application that starts a foundation READ as
indicated below:
<P>
<PRE>   DO MAIN.MPR
   READ VALID handler()    &amp;&amp;  Wait for the user to take action.

</PRE>A menu option executes a screen set and invokes a child (nested) READ
command. In this session, the application issues a CLEAR READ command.
Doing so terminates both READ commands and triggers the VALID clause
for the foundation READ. However, if the child READ command issues
another (third) READ command, terminating the third READ command does
not trigger the VALID clause.
<P>
During a normal READ command (with a GET clause), the following events
trigger the VALID clause: pressing CTRL+W, pressing ESC, pressing the
TAB key past the last GET when READ CYCLE is off, or pressing TAB past
the first GET when READ CYCLE is off. Note that issuing a CLEAR READ
command does not trigger the VALID clause.
<P>
During a foundation READ (without a GET clause), the following events
trigger the VALID clause: pressing CTRL+W, pressing ESC, clicking the
mouse, and any key press that does not correspond to a menu selection
or to an ON KEY LABEL command.
