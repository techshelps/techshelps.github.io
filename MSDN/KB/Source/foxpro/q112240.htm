<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Screens created with the Screen Wizard do not alter the setting of SET
EXCLUSIVE. In order to use a screen that was created with the Screen Wizard
in a multiuser environment, you must issue the SET EXCLUSIVE OFF command
before running the screen.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: A database can be opened as SHARED without issuing SET EXCLUSIVE OFF
prior to opening the database.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 1</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: This is an example of running a screen that was created with the
   Screen Wizard in a multiuser environment.

   FoxPro 2.x Code:
   ----------------

   SET EXCLUSIVE ON
   USE xyz.dbf SHARED
   DO screen.spr          &amp;&amp; This screen could be a screen that was
                           * created with the Screen Wizard.
   Visual FoxPro Code:
   -------------------

   SET EXCLUSIVE ON
   USE xyz.dbf SHARED
   DO FORM screen.scx          &amp;&amp; This screen could be a screen that was
                                * created with the Screen Wizard.
