<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Editing general fields is much easier in Visual FoxPro. A new control
called the OLE Bound Control is used to select general fields in the Form
Builder and allow editing of a general field when the form is running.
The application used to place the data into the general field when it was
created is the application that will appear on the screen when the form is
running and you click the general field to edit it.
<P>
For example, if you placed data into the general field by clicking Insert
Object on the Edit menu and then clicking Paintbrush, Paintbrush will
appear when you click the general field object of the form. Some
applications that are OLE 2.0 aware, such as Microsoft Word or Microsoft
Excel, will add their functionality to the FoxPro menu, so you need only
click the menu to change the data in the general field object of the form.

<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a table with a general field in it, and save the table.

<P><LI>When prompted to Input Data Records Now, click Yes. Double-click the
   general field to open it. On the Edit menu, click Insert Object. In
   the Object Type list, scroll down to the Paintbrush Picture item and
   select it. When Paintbrush appears, draw something in the paintbrush
   window. On the File menu in Paintbrush, click Exit to Return to
   &lt;tablename.fieldname&gt;. Click Yes in the window that appears to update
   the general field.

<P><LI>Close the general field by pressing CTRL+W. Add another record to the
   table and repeat step 2. This time select another application in the
   Object Type box. If the application is OLE 2 aware, editing will take
   place in the general field itself. Close the general field to save the
   data placed into it.

<P><LI>Close the Browse window of the table, and create a form. Choose the OLE
   Bound Control from the Forms Control toolbar, and place it on the form.

<P><LI>In the Properties sheet, type the name of the general field in the
   ControlSource property of the OLE Bound control.

<P><LI>To allow all of the data from the general field to fit into the OLE
   object of the form, select 1 or 2 in the Stretch property.

<P><LI>Place a command button on the form, and type the following code into its
   Click event:
<P>
   SKIP
   THISFORM.REFRESH

<P><LI>Run the form, and double-click the general field. Note that Paintbrush
   appears allowing the picture to be edited. Make changes to the
   paintbrush picture, and close it. Click the command button, and then
   double-click the general field again. Note that the application used to
   place the data into the general field earlier appears again.
