<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information below describes the Group/Total Report Wizard and how to
use it to create a report with groupings and, optionally, totals.
<P>
This information is also found in FoxPro online Help in the "Group/Total
Report Wizard" topic.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Group/Total Report Wizard creates a report that sorts records into up
to three groupings, and optionally provides subtotals and totals for
numeric fields.
<P>
<P><h3>GROUP/TOTAL REPORT WIZARD STEPS</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1 of 7: Selecting a Table</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: This step is skipped if you start the wizard from the Catalog
Manager, and a table is already in use.
<P>
First, select the table you want to use for your report. The list contains
the tables that were open when you started the wizard. If you want to use a
table that is not currently open, choose the Open... button.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2 of 7: Selecting a Style for the Report</h3>
 
<P>
Select one of the available styles for your report. (In FoxPro for Windows,
the graphic on the wizard screen changes to show you what the report will
look like.) If you need to adjust your printer settings, choose the
Printers button (in FoxPro for Windows, choose the Print Setup... button).
<P>
<P><h3>Step 3 of 7: Selecting the Fields to Include in the Report</h3>
 
<P>
First, select the fields you want to include in your report. The Available
Fields list shows all the fields in the table you selected.
<P>
To select fields, you can:

<UL><LI>Double-click each field name in the Available Fields list.

<LI>Select each field name and choose the Add button.

<LI>Choose the Add All button to use all the table fields.
<P>
</UL>If you add a field you don't need, select it  and choose the Remove button.
<P>
Step 4 of 7: Setting Group Levels
 
<P>
From the Available Fields list, select up to three fields by which to group
and sort the records in your report.
<P>
For example, if you group by state and zip code, the records will be sorted
into groups by state, then grouped and sorted by zip code within each
state.
<P>
Choose the Ascending option to sort records from the beginning of the
alphabet, the lowest number, or the earliest date; choose the Descending
option to sort records from the end of the alphabet, the highest number, or
the latest date.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 5 of 7: Setting Grouping Options</h3>
 
<P>
You can group the fields in your report by the entire contents of each
field. If you want to make the groupings larger, you can specify that the
fields be grouped by their first character, or their first two or three
characters.
<P>
For example, if you were grouping the names Smith, Samuels, and Snyder by
the entire field, each name would appear in its own group. If you grouped
by first letter, all three names would appear in the same group.
<P>
For numeric fields, by default each unique number constitutes a separate
group. If you choose, for example, to group by 10s, then all the values
from 0 to 9 would be part of the same group.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 6 of 7: Including Totals and/or Subtotals</h3>
 
<P>
This step appears only if your table contains numeric fields that are not
used as a group header in the report. Numeric fields will be totaled and/or
subtotaled within each group defined.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 7 of 7: Naming, Previewing, Saving, Modifying, or Printing the Report</h3>
 
<P>
First, enter the title you want to appear at the top of your new report.
Then, choose the Preview... button to see your report in a preview window.
If you are satisfied with the results, select one of the following options,
and then choose the Finish button.

<UL><LI>Save for Later Use creates a Microsoft FoxPro report file (.FRX file)
   which you can later use to run your report.

<LI>Save and Print Report displays the Save As dialog so you can save the
   report, then displays the Print dialog so you can select print options
   and send it to a printer.

<LI>Modify Report with Design Tool saves the report and displays it in the
   Report Layout window, so you can modify it as needed.
