<P>
This article contains answers to frequently asked questions about Microsoft
FoxPro version 2.6 for MS-DOS. This article is divided into four sections:
<P>
<PRE>   Installation
   Network Issues
   Printing Issues
   Screens

</PRE><h2>PART 1: INSTALLATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. I get the error message "Cannot Create &lt;Path&gt;\FOXPRO.EXE" during
<P><PRE>       installation. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. One possible cause is that FOXPRO.EXE or FOXPROX.EXE already exists
       in that directory and it is marked read-only.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       In order for the Setup program to perform a successful installation,
       you must either rename the .EXE file or mark it as read/write. To
       mark the file as read/write, use the MS-DOS command ATTRIB -R
       &lt;path&gt;\FOXPRO.EXE to remove the Read-Only attribute from the file.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What are the minimum files required to run FoxPro?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Not all files placed on the hard disk during installation of FoxPro
       are absolutely required for operation of the product. FoxPro version
       2.6 for MS-DOS can be started with only two files: FOXPRO.EXE and
       FOXPRO.OVL. For the Extended (32 bit) version, these two files can
       be replaced by only one, FOXPROX.EXE.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       The minimum files needed to run FoxPro version 2.6, use the menu and
       screen generators, and set printer drivers are listed below.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       NOTE: Upon startup, FoxPro will create FOXUSER.DBF and FOXUSER.FPT
       files, and upon screen or menu generation, it will create the
       appropriate .FXP files.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. A "CRC Error" occurs during Setup. How can I correct this error?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. When reading a disk, MS-DOS performs a cyclical redundancy check
       (CRC) to verify disk sectors. The CRC is a sophisticated parity
       check of the data in each sector and will detect most data errors,
       such as lost or scrambled bits.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       To determine if there is a problem with the disks:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Attempt the installation a second time.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       2. Install on a "clean" (minimal) configuration.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       3. Install on another machine to verify there is not a hardware
<PRE></PRE>          problem.

       4. Copy the floppy disks to a temporary directory on the hard disk
          and run the Setup program from this temporary directory.

       If the installation still fails, call Microsoft Technical Support
       for assistance.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. When I'm running the INSTALL /N command, I get the error message
<P><PRE>       "File 'ADDUSER.APP' Does Not Exist." How can I correct this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The INSTALL /N command was not issued from the directory containing
       the Administrative Installation (INSTALL /A) of FoxPro.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       After a Workstation Installation completes the Basic portion of its
       installation, it calls the FoxPro program ADDUSER.APP to configure
       the workstation for the network environment. In order for FoxPro to
       load and run ADDDUSER.APP, the current directory must be the
       Administrative Installation directory.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       Even if the Administrative Installation directory is on the MS-DOS
       search path, allowing FoxPro itself to start, because ADDUSER.APP is
       not an MS-DOS executable program (.COM or .EXE), it cannot be
       located on the path, thus causing the error message.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. The Configuration portion of INSTALL /N fails. How can I correct
<P><PRE>       this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The command, "INSTALL /N" (without the quotation marks) was not
       issued from the directory containing the Administrative Installation
       (INSTALL /A) of FoxPro.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       Go to the drive and directory containing the Administrative
       Installation of FoxPro, then reissue the INSTALL /N command.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       After a Workstation Installation completes the Basic portion of its
       installation, it calls the FoxPro program ADDUSER.APP to configure
       the workstation for the network environment. In order for FoxPro to
       load and run ADDDUSER.APP, the current directory must be the
       Administrative Installation directory.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       The error received depends on which directory you started INSTALL /N
       from, and whether you are running it from an MS-DOS prompt in
       Windows, or at MS-DOS itself.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why does INSTALL /N prompt for a floppy disk?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. The INSTALL /N command was not issued from the Administrative
       Installation directory.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       To avoid this problem, use one of the following workarounds.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       Workaround 1: Go to the Administrative Installation Directory
       -------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       Go to the Administrative Installation directory, and then type the
       command "INSTALL /N" (without the quotation marks).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       For example, assuming the Administrative Installation is located in
       a directory named N:\ADMIN, type the following commands at the
       MS-DOS prompt:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          n:
          cd\admin
          install /n

       Workaround 2: Use SUBST to Reassign the Letter of the Local Drive
       -----------------------------------------------------------------

       If for testing or other purposes you require that the Administrative
       Installation be located on a local hard disk and you do not want to
       issue the INSTALL /N command from the Administrative Installation
       directory, use the MS-DOS SUBST command to reassign the directory
       containing the Administrative Installation to another drive letter.

       For example, assuming the Administrative Installation is located in
       a directory named C:\ADMIN and you want to create a Workstation
       Installation in a directory named C:\WORKSTA, type the following at
       the MS-DOS prompt:

          subst n: c:\admin
          c:
          cd\worksta
          n:\install /n

       The Workstation Installation requires a previous Administrative
       Installation. Even though it prompts for a floppy disk, the
       Workstation Installation cannot be performed using the Installation
       floppy disks.


</PRE></OL><h2>PART 2: NETWORK ISSUES</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. I get a "File Access Denied" error message when writing to file. How
<P><PRE>       can I correct this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The steps you must use to resolve this problem depends on the
       network product you are using.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       For a LANtastic network, do the following:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Check the files and locks settings for the SHARE command in the
<PRE></PRE>          AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The recommended settings are as follows:

             share /f:5120 /l:500

          NOTE: This command uses a lowercase "L", not a number 1.

       2. Verify that the .EXE, .RSC, and .OVL files are marked read-only.
          If necessary, change the security using the MS-DOS ATTRIB command
          (for example, ATTRIB +R &lt;filename&gt;).

       3. Make sure that the CONFIG.FP file on the server redirects the
          OVERLAY= statement to a directory other than the directory
          containing the FOXPRO.EXE file.

       For a Novell network, do the following:

       1. Check the user's privileges.

       2. Have the user log in as a supervisor and repeat the operation.

       3. Make sure that the .EXE, .ESO and .ESL files are marked read-
          only. If necessary, change the security using the MS-DOS ATTRIB
          command (ATTRIB +R &lt;filename&gt;).

       LANtastic and Novell are manufactured by vendors independent of
       Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
       these products' performance or reliability.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. How do I resolve the "Sharing Violation Reading Drive" error?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. The following are six troubleshooting steps for this error:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - Verify that each user has a FOXUSER.DBF file.

        - Verify that the CONFIG.FP file on the server includes the
          EXCLUSIVE=OFF statement. If EXCLUSIVE=OFF is used, database files
          can be shared.

        - Verify that the CONFIG.FP file on the server includes the
          RESOURCE=OFF statement, or that each user's FOXUSER.DBF and
          FOXUSER.FPT files are marked read-only.

        - If you are using FoxPro version 2.6 for MS-DOS, verify that the
          FOXPRO.EXE, FOXPROX.EXE, and FOXR.EXE files are marked read-only.

        - If you use the Distribution Kit to create a stand-alone
          application, verify that the .EXE files are marked read-only.

        - If you create compact executable files, mark the .ESL and .ESO
          files read-only.

        - In some cases, the MS-DOS SHARE program must be loaded on the
          server and on each workstation. Specify the /F and /L parameters
          as follows:

             share /f:5120 /l:500

          NOTE: This command uses a lowercase "L", not a number 1.

</PRE></OL><h2>PART 3: PRINTING ISSUES</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. How do I start a print job from a page other than page 1?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. To start a print job at a location other than page 1, set _PBPAGE to
       the number of the page at which printing should start and create a
       program that uses the PRINTJOB ... ENDPRINTJOB commands.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       Using the _PBPAGE variable to specify the page number where a print
       job starts does not work outside the PRINTJOB ... ENDPRINTJOB
       structure.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       For example, suppose your printer jammed on page 75 of a 100-page
       report and all output from page 75 through 100 was lost. The code to
       re-create the last 25 pages is as follows:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          _PBPAGE=75
          PRINTJOB
          REPORT FORM C:\FOXPRO2\test.FRX ;
             ENVIRONMENT PDSETUP TO PRINT
          ENDPRINTJOB

       If you wanted to print only page 75, then set "_PBPAGE=75" and
       "_PEPAGE=75" in the previous example.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. I am having problems printing labels on a laser printer without
<P><PRE>       using a printer driver. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Printing labels to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) laser printer without
       using a printer driver requires that certain escape codes be sent to
       the printer before the command to print the labels.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       For example, Avery 5161 or 5261 labels measure 1-by-4 inches. One
       page of labels has two columns of ten labels each. To print this
       label type, execute code similar to the following:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          SET PDSETUP TO
          ??? CHR(27)+'E'        &amp;&amp; Reset
          ??? CHR(27)+'&amp;l8.00C'  &amp;&amp; Line height 8/48" (LPI 6)
          ??? CHR(27)+'&amp;l3E'     &amp;&amp; Top margin 3 lines
          ??? CHR(27)+'&amp;l56P'    &amp;&amp; Page length 60 lines
          LABEL FORM &lt;labelname&gt; TO PRINTER
          SET PRINTER TO

       NOTE: The escape code lines that contain an ampersand (&amp;) use a
       lowercase "L", not a number 1.

       In the label generator, use the following settings:

          Margin - 3
          Width  - 34
          Number across - 2
          Height - 6
          Lines between - 0

       The above settings are only an example and may need to be modified
       for specific labels, printers, and applications. For exact escape
       code sequences, see your printer's manual.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. I get the error message "Cannot Write to Read-Only File" when
<P><PRE>       printing a report. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Given the following circumstances, the error message "Cannot Write
       to a Read-Only File" will occur when you try to print a report from
       within an application (.APP) or an executable (.EXE) program:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - The resource file is included in the project.

        - The resource is set to the included filename.

        - The REPORT FORM &lt;name&gt; PDSETUP TO PRINT or LABEL FORM &lt;name&gt;
          PDSETUP TO PRINT command is issued.

       There are two ways to avoid this problem:

        - Remove PDSETUP from the command.

          -or-

        - Mark the resource file as excluded and ship it along with the
          .APP or .EXE file.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. I get an extra blank line when printing labels. How can I correct
<P><PRE>       this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. This behavior existed in dBASE III and FoxBASE. It was changed in
       FoxPro version 1.02. However, to maintain compatibility with the
       large installed base of Xbase applications, a design decision was
       made to revert to the original behavior.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       To work around this behavior, print the label form to a file, open
       the file with low-level file functions, remove the carriage
       return/linefeed (CR/LF) characters and send the file to the printer
       using the MS-DOS COPY command. For example:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          * Set the number of lines printed per page and print to a file.
          _PLENGTH=56
          LABEL FORM &lt;form name&gt; ENVIRONMENT PDSETUP TO FILE temp.txt

          * Open file and replace the CR/LF pair with null characters.
          filehand=FOPEN('temp.txt',2)
          =FGETS(filehand)
          =FSEEK(filehand,-2,1)
          =FWRITE(filehand,chr(0)+chr(0))
          =FCLOSE(filehand)

          * Copy the file to printer and prevent the appearance of the
          * MS-DOS screen.
          HIDE WINDOW SAVE ALL
          RUN COPY temp.txt LPT1 &gt; NUL
          SHOW WINDOW ALL

</PRE><P><LI> Q. I have NewPage and ResetPage enabled in my data grouping, but my
<P><PRE>       page numbering is not reset to 1. How can I correct this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The report has a Bottom Margin setting greater than 0 (zero).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       Set Bottom Margin to 0 and add the necessary lines to the Page
       Footer band. For example, if Bottom Margin is set to 2, reset it to
       0 and add two lines to the Page Footer band.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I get the error message "File ["&lt;File&gt;"] Does Not Exist" when
<P><PRE>       printing on a LAN Manager network. How do I correct this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. When the program attempts to open a file, it looks in a particular
       directory. If it does not find the file there it tries other
       directories until the file is found. When LAN Manager's "chartime"
       timer (which defaults to 250 milliseconds) expires, it sends a spool
       close message to the workstation, and if the program is in the
       middle of a search for the next file to open, the program exits
       incorrectly with the error mentioned above.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       If the chartime parameter in the LANMAN.INI file for the workstation
       is set to a sufficiently high value, the program will not be
       interrupted by the spool close message and will work correctly.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       In LAN Manager version 2.1, the chartime parameter controls the
       amount of time the spooler waits for additional print data before
       closing the current spool file and printing it. In earlier versions
       of LAN Manager, this parameter controls the amount of time to wait
       for pipe data or comm queue data.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       For more information about the chartime parameter and the LANMAN.INI
       file, refer to the LAN Manager documentation or contact Microsoft
       LAN Manager Technical Support.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       See also page 225 in the Microsoft LAN Manager "Administrator's
       Reference" for version 2.1.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h2>PART 4: SCREENS</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. How do I coordinate Browse windows with screens?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Page D2-96 of the FoxPro for Windows "Developer's Guide" and page
       D2-90 of the FoxPro for MS-DOS "Developers Guide" give samples for
       coordinating Browse windows with screens; however, the SAVE clause
       has been omitted from the examples. If the optional BROWSE parameter
       SAVE is omitted, the Browse window will close as soon as any other
       object is clicked.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       To avoid this behavior, change the code examples as follows:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          IF NOT WVISIBLE("Client List")
             BROWSE NORMAL NOWAIT NODELETE LAST TITLE "Client List" ;
                NOAPPEND NOMENU SAVE FIELDS company ;
                WHEN showgets()
          ENDIF

          IF NOT WVISIBLE("Account Details")
             SELECT details
                BROWSE NORMAL NOWAIT NODELETE LAST TITLE "Client List" ;
                   NOAPPEND NOMENU SAVE  ;
                   FIELDS ;
                   Trans_type:10, ;
                   Trans_date:10, ;
                   Amt:7,Service
             SELECT clients
          ENDIF

</PRE><P><LI> Q. How can I page through a format file that contains a READ command?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Pressing the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys skips one record at a time,
       forward or backward, in the database and also refreshes the GETs on
       the screen.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       You can place objects on different pages or different screens by
       placing a READ command in the format file. The READ command should
       be placed after the last GET that would appear on each screen. The
       following format file example places two objects on the first screen
       and two more on the second screen. To display the objects that are
       on the next screen, press the PAGE UP or PAGE DOWN key.
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          @5,1 GET &lt;var1&gt;
          @6,1 GET &lt;var2&gt;
          READ
          @5,1 GET &lt;var3&gt;
          @6,1 GET &lt;var4&gt;

</PRE><P><LI> Q. The Cycle command does not work for desktop screens. How can I
<P><PRE>       correct this?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The Cycle command on the Window menu is designed to switch between
       windows defined on the desktop. When a screen set contains several
       windows and a desktop screen, Cycle stops on the desktop screen.
       This is normal behavior, since the Cycle command is intended to be
       used with window screens, not the desktop.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       To work around this behavior, define a window with no borders
       instead of using a desktop screen. This will produce a window that
       looks like the desktop.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       The Cycle command is used for cycling through window screens in a
       screen set or windows defined on the desktop. The shortcut key
       CTRL+F1 can also be used to cycle through windows on the desktop.
