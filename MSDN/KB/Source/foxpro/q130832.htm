<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
CONVERT.APP is a Visual FoxPro application that performs a functional
conversion of FoxPro version 2.x screens, reports, and projects to Visual
FoxPro forms, reports, and projects. This article focuses on the functional
screen conversion process and explores some of the properties exposed in a
converted form.
<P>
The following descriptions of Visual and Functional conversions are also
located in the online Help associated with the Conversion Options dialog
box:
<P>
<P><h3>Functional Conversion</h3>
 
<P>
Creates form and control images and copies code to locations in object
properties, events, and methods. Functional conversion provides immediate
FoxPro 2.6 READ compatibility so you can use forms in Visual FoxPro without
making extensive manual changes. To gain complete event model
functionality, you must eliminate pages and page frames, change the form
set WindowType property, and manually relocate code in methods and events.
For details, see Checking Converted FoxPro 2.6 Screens.
<P>
<P><h3>Visual Conversion</h3>
 
<P>
Creates images of forms and all controls, but copies all the code from the
original FoxPro 2.6 project or screens to a non-compilable .PRG file.
Choose Visual Conversion if you want to move to full Visual FoxPro
functionality without having to eliminate pages and page frames, change the
form set WindowType property, and manually relocate code from object to
object. For details, see Checking Converted FoxPro 2.6 Screens.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A functional conversion provides immediate FoxPro version 2.x READ
compatibility in Visual FoxPro. Because the event model of Visual FoxPro is
different from the model used by FoxPro versions 2.x, a special case has
been implemented with Visual FoxPro forms to emulate READ behavior of the
older FoxPro versions. This includes the use of form sets, forms, page
frames, and pages. With every functional conversion, a form set is created.
Each form set contains a form per screen, which in turn contains a page
frame.
<P>
All of the 2.x objects are placed as controls on a page in a page frame,
and multiple READs are represented by multiple pages. After you execute a
functional conversion of your FoxPro versions 2.x screen, you can edit the
newly created Visual FoxPro form. Notice that some properties and methods
are unique to converted forms.
<P>
<P><h3>WindowType Property</h3>
 
<P>
The WindowType property of the form set has a value of 2-Read or 3-Read
Modal. These values make the form set behave as if it were activated by a
READ. A Page Frame is required to set the WindowType property to 2 or 3.
<P>
<P><h3>READ Properties and Methods</h3>
 
<P>
You can use the following properties and methods in a form set if the
WindowType property is 2-Read or 3-Read Modal:
<P>
<PRE>   ReadActivate
   ReadCycle
   ReadDeactivate
   ReadLock
   ReadMouse
   ReadSave
   ReadTimeOut
   ReadValid
   ReadWhen
   WindowList

</PRE>They all relate to READ clauses. For more information, search for the
specific property or method in the Visual FoxPro Help file.
<P>
Hidden Properties
 
<P>
The following properties are used by converted READ-mode forms. They do not
appear in the property sheet. However, the error "Property Name Already In
Use" is displayed if you attempt to add a new property with the following
names.

<UL><LI>ReleaseErase
<P>
   This property is used by controls to indicate that when they are
   released, their image should remain on the form. Read uses this because
   after a READ terminates, the images of the objects remain on the form.

<LI>ReleaseWindows
<P>
   This property is used by converted forms to support the Release Windows
   check box that is used in the Generate or Project Manager dialog in
   FoxPro versions 2.x.

<LI>ErasePage
<P>
   Nested READs within a form are simulated by using "invisible" form
   pages. The ErasePage property is set to false to prevent objects from a
   previous READ level to be erased when READ switches form pages.
