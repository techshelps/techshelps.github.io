The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The format of the data entry @ ... GET edit region for a telephone number
can be controlled programmatically with a mask defined using the PICTURE
clause, or it can be controlled in the Screen Builder or Form Designer by
specifying the picture in the Format edit region of the Field dialog box.
The examples shown below illustrate both methods.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The @ ... GET ... PICTURE clause provides the means of specifying a mask to
control the format of data entered in a GET object in a window. The
following paragraphs show examples of parameters of the clause that create
a mask to control the format of a GET for entering a telephone number.
These parameters provide all the customary nondata formatting characters
(such as parentheses and dashes), but allow FoxPro to store only the
numeric information so that the number is saved in just ten characters,
either as a character field or as a numeric field. The parameters can be
included either in a hard-coded "@ n.n GET &lt;variable/field name&gt; PICTURE
..." (without the quotation marks) command or they can be included in the
Format box in the Field dialog box of FoxPro's Screen Builder.
<P>
<P><h3>FoxPro 2.x for Windows Examples</h3>
 
<P>
For example, if the telephone number is to appear on the screen as follows
(these numbers are for example purposes only)
<P>
<PRE>   (213)123-1234

</PRE>the PICTURE clause should appear as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   PICTURE "@R (999)999-9999"

</PRE>The string to enter in the Format box in the Field dialog box is:
<P>
<PRE>   @R (999)999-9999

</PRE>Likewise, if the telephone number is to appear as follows
<P>
<PRE>   213/123-1234

</PRE>the mask should appear as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   @R 999/999-9999

</PRE><h3>Visual FoxPro for Windows Examples</h3>
 
<P>
For example, if the telephone number is to appear on the screen as follows
(these numbers are for example purposes only)
<P>
<PRE>   (213)123-1234

</PRE>Set the Format property to "R" (without quotation marks) and the InputMask
property to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   (999)999-9999

</PRE>Likewise, if the telephone number is to appear as follows
<P>
<PRE>   213/123-1234

</PRE>the Format property should be "R" (without quotation marks) and the
InputMask should appear as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   999/999-9999

</PRE><h3>Notes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The "@" symbol defines the characters following it as belonging to the
   PICTURE clause.

<LI>The capital letter "R" and the space character following the "R" display
   a format mask in an @ ... GET editing region. These mask characters are
   not stored in the field when the @ ... GET editing region is exited.

<LI>The mask characters shown in the above examples, other than the digit 9,
   are not stored in the table. These characters are skipped over when keys
   are pressed during data entry.

<LI>The nines (9) in the mask allow only digits to be entered in character
   fields; in numeric fields, they allow digits and signs to be entered.
   Since a telephone number consists of digits but is seldom used in
   arithmetic operations, the database field holding the number should be
   defined as a character field. Only digits in the range from zero through
   nine are accepted in the edit region.
<P>

For additional PICTURE code options, see pages L3-33, L3-34, and L3-35 of
the "Language Reference" for FoxPro for MS-DOS and Windows, or see page 47
of the "Language Reference" for FoxPro for Macintosh. Also refer to the
online Help topic for the @ ... GET command.
