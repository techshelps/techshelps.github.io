The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Below is the complete FoxPro for MS-DOS INSTALL.TXT file found in the main
FoxPro directory (usually FOXPRO25).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>                       INSTALLING FOXPRO FOR MS-DOS
                       ============================

</PRE>Three installation options are available with FoxPro for MS-DOS:

<UL><LI>Normal Installation copies the FoxPro program files, help files  and
   examples from disk or from a network to your hard drive.  Normal
   Installation installs FoxPro for MS-DOS on a single  machine.

<LI>Administrative Installation (/A) copies all FoxPro files along with
   installation files to a network drive so that users can either run the
   shared network copy after doing a Workstation Installation or install
   FoxPro for MS-DOS to their local machines with a Normal Installation.

<LI>Workstation Installation (/N) copies FoxPro initialization files to a
   local machine so that a shared network version of FoxPro for MS-DOS can
   be run. Workstation Installation requires less space on individual
   machines and allows greater administrative control of the use of FoxPro.
   Workstation Installation requires a previous Administrative
   Installation.

<LI>Normal Installation After an Administrative Installation works the same
   way Normal Installation from floppy disks works. The way you initiate
   Normal Installation after an Administrative Installation is by typing
   "X:\&lt;path&gt;\INSTALL" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt
   and pressing ENTER. X represents the network drive and &lt;path&gt; represents
   the directory in which FoxPro was installed with the Administrative
   Installation option.
<P>
<P><PRE>      **************************************************************
<PRE></PRE>      * NOTE: Every Microsoft FoxPro user must have a Microsoft    *
      * FoxPro license. A license is obtained by buying a retail   *
      * package or a Microsoft License Pack. For more information  *
      * about network use restrictions, see your Microsoft FoxPro  *
      * license agreement.                                         *
      **************************************************************

</PRE></UL>For information about Normal Installation, see the FoxPro for MS-DOS
Installation and Configuration manual.
<P>
FoxPro asks you several questions during the installation process. The
default response is listed in brackets, for example:
<P>
<PRE>   Is this information correct? [Y] :

</PRE>To choose the default response, press ENTER.
<P>
These instructions assume that you are installing from drive A. If you are
installing from another drive, please adjust the instructions accordingly.
<P>
<P><h2>ADMINISTRATIVE INSTALLATION (/A)</h2>
 
<P>
Before you start the Administrative Installation, the network must be
operational and you must have read and write access to the network
directory in which you want to install FoxPro. For more information, see
your network software documentation.
<P>
To install FoxPro for MS-DOS for administrative use:

<OL><P><LI>Insert FoxPro Disk 1 into drive A.

<P><LI>Type "A:\INSTALL /A" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt
   and press ENTER.

<P><LI>Enter your name and company in the spaces provided. You will be asked to
   confirm this information. If you re-install FoxPro, this information
   will automatically be included. When you start FoxPro for MS-DOS, this
   information will appear on the initialization screen.

<P><LI>The installation program suggests a directory in which to install FoxPro
   for MS-DOS. To confirm that you want to install FoxPro in this
   directory, press ENTER. If you do not want to install FoxPro in the
   default directory, type N and press ENTER. You will be prompted for an
   installation directory.

<P><LI>If the directory in which FoxPro will be installed is not in your path,
   the installation program asks you whether or not you want your path
   changed in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Press ENTER to allow the
   modification, or type N and press ENTER if you do not want your path
   modified.

<P><LI>The required FoxPro for MS-DOS files and all files necessary for
   subsequent installations are copied to the server. When the basic
   installation is completed, you are prompted to press ESC to quit or any
   other key to continue with optional component installation.
<P>
</OL><h3>Optional Component Installation</h3>
 
<P>
The optional components you choose to install in the Administrative
Installation are available for workstation use; those components you do not
install are not available. All FoxPro components remain available to those
who perform Normal Installations after the Administrative Installation,
regardless of which optional components you include.
<P>
Before installing optional components, the installation program prompts you
to choose the type of monitor used with your system.
<P>
Use the arrow keys to highlight the appropriate monitor type and press
ENTER.
<P>
During installation, you are given the option of installing the FoxPro
supplemental programs and files. This step is identical to the
corresponding step in Normal Installation. For more information, refer to
the FoxPro for MS-DOS Installation and Configuration manual.
<P>
<P><h3>Stopping the Installation</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to stop the installation process, you can press ESC at any
prompt or press CTRL+C at any time. Note that if you press CTRL+C,
installation does not stop immediately. When it does, the MS-DOS prompt
appears.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Additional Files</h3>
 
<P>
After you have installed FoxPro, you can install any optional
components that you did not specify during installation. To do
so, restart FoxPro by typing FOX at the MS-DOS prompt and pressing
ENTER. Insert any one of the product disks into the floppy drive
and enter the following command in FoxPro's Command window:
<P>
<PRE>   DO INSTALL

</PRE></OL>You will be prompted to insert the disk or disks that contain the
additional files that you want to install.
<P>
NOTE: If you are installing from a drive other than A:, you will be
instructed to select another source drive after the "Abort, Retry, Fail?"
message.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKSTATION INSTALLATION (/N)</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Type "X:\&lt;path&gt;\INSTALL /N" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-
    DOS prompt. X represents the network drive and &lt;path&gt; represents the
    directory in which FoxPro was installed with the Administrative
    Installation option.

<P><LI>The installation program suggests a directory in which to install
    FoxPro. To confirm that you want to install FoxPro in this directory,
    press ENTER. If you do not want to install FoxPro in the default
    directory, type N and press ENTER. You will be prompted for an
    installation directory.

<P><LI>If the directory in which FoxPro will be installed is not in your
    path, the installation program asks you whether or not you want your
    path changed in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Press ENTER to allow the
    modification, or type N and press ENTER if you do not want your path
    modified.

<P><LI>FOX.EXE is copied to your FoxPro directory. You can end the
    installation by pressing ESC at this point or press any other key to
    configure your FoxPro workstation.

<P><LI>An information screen explains FoxPro configuration and allows you to
    specify the directory for your configuration files to be created in.
    The default is your FoxPro directory. Press ENTER to accept this
    default or type your preferred directory in the text box and press
    ENTER.

<P><LI>Choose &lt;&lt;Continue with configuration&gt;&gt; to proceed or &lt;Abort
    configuration procedure&gt; to cancel the configuration procedure.

<P><LI>A dialog opens so that you can set the directories for:
<P>
     * CONFIG.FP - Your FoxPro configuration file.
     * FOXUSER - A FoxPro database that keeps track of window sizes and so
       on.
     * Overlay files - Since the FoxPro executable file is too large to fit
       in conventional memory at one time, parts of it are kept in overlay
       files and loaded into memory as needed.
     * Editor work files - Temporary files created during editing sessions.
     * Sort work files - Temporary files used during database sorting and
       indexing.
     * Program work file - Temporary program file.
<P>
    Descriptions of these options are included in the dialog. By default,
    FoxPro uses all available expanded memory. In this dialog, you are
    given the option to Limit EMS Available to FoxPro. There are three
    push buttons at the bottom of the dialog:
<P>
<PRE>     &lt;&lt;OK&gt;&gt;   - Accept the directories and EMS settings.
     &lt;filer&gt;  - Open the FoxPro Filer accessory to view your directories
                before deciding on configuration directory defaults.
     &lt;Cancel&gt; - Cancel the configuration procedure.

</PRE><P><LI>You are given the option to have FoxPro update your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
    so that FoxPro looks for configuration information in the directories
    that you have specified.

<P><LI>You are given the option to have configuration changes written to your
    CONFIG.FP file.

<P><LI>Installation is complete. Press any key to start FoxPro. Remember to
    reboot your machine so that changes made to your AUTOEXEC.BAT can take
    effect.
