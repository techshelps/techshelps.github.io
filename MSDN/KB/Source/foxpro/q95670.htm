<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When the SELECT SQL statement is used to join two databases, the
desired effect is to retrieve records that meet conditions involving
the databases in the FROM clause. However, under some circumstances,
the join might not return any records. The code and explanation below
demonstrate this.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The query below demonstrates a join of the CUSTOMER.DBF and
INVOICES.DBF databases in the TUTORIAL directory. This join should
retrieve all the customers who are NOT in the INVOICES database:
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT customer.company, customer.cno ;
     FROM customer, invoices ;
     WHERE customer.cno NOT IN ;
       (SELECT invoices.cno FROM invoices ;
          WHERE customer.cno = invoices.cno) ;
   INTO CURSOR QUERY

</PRE>The query above retrieves all the customers who do not have any
invoices. However, if the INVOICES database is empty, the above query
doesn't return any records even though the expected result is for
every record to be returned. This effect occurs because the INVOICES
database appears in the first FROM clause of the first SELECT
statement.
<P>
A database that appears in a FROM clause must contain at least one
record in order for the query to work correctly. Therefore, if the
INVOICES database reference in the first FROM clause of the first
SELECT statement is removed, all the customers who are not in the
INVOICES database will be returned. This result occurs even if the
INVOICES database is empty. The query below demonstrates this behavior:
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT customer.company, customer.cno ;
     FROM customer ;
     WHERE customer.cno NOT IN ;
        (SELECT invoices.cno FROM invoices ;
          WHERE customer.cno = invoices.cno) ;
   INTO CURSOR QUERY
</PRE>
