The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0 and 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After a report has been generated using the Report Wizard, the report bands
(Detail, Group or Page Header bands) act as if they cannot be shrunk above
the position of a memo field or a long character field, even if the memo or
long character field and its label has been deleted or moved.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When other fields lie below the memo or long character field, the Report
Wizard adds an invisible line below each memo field and long character
field to control the floating characteristics of these fields and their
labels.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If it is necessary to edit a Wizard-generated report, ensure that the line
below the memo or long character field is moved with these fields or is
deleted from the report.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. The Report Wizard adds the invisible line below
these fields that have a potential to grow and float to keep the labels
positioned with their respective field.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Report Wizard should always add an invisible line below a memo or long
character field when there are other fields are below these fields. The
Report Wizard's apparent threshold width of the character field before
placing a line underneath is around 60 to 65 characters. Of the three types
of Report Wizards, the standard Report Wizard and the One-to-Many Report
Wizard seem to exhibit this behavior most. In the standard Report Wizard,
it is usually the Detail band that appears to not shorten. In the One-to-
Many Report Wizard, it could be the Group Header, the Detail band, or both,
depending on whether a memo or long character field is added to the
respective band.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the Employee table in the Vfp\Samples\Data subdirectory.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Wizards, and then click Report.

<P><LI>Select the Report Wizard, and click OK.

<P><LI>In the Available Fields list, scroll down and move Notes to the Selected
   Fields list. Then move the First_Name and Last_name fields to the
   Selected Fields list.

<P><LI>Click the Next button twice until Step 3 is reached. In the Step 3 -
   Layout dialog box, click Rows in the Field Layout section.

<P><LI>Click Finish. In Step 5 - Finish, select the "Save report and modify it
   in the Report Designer." Click the Finish button, and give the report
   a name. Then click Save.

<P><LI>With the report open in the Report Designer, select the Last Name label
   control, and press the DELETE key or choose Clear from the Edit menu.
   Repeat this process for the First Name label and the Last_name and
   First_name fields.

<P><LI>Try to close the Detail band by clicking the band itself and dragging it
   upward, or double-click the Detail band, reduce the height spinner
   value, and choose OK.
<P>
</OL>The Detail band should not close up all the way to the notes field. This is
because of the invisible line.
<P>
To find out where the lines are, choose Select All from the Edit menu, or
use the mouse to draw and drag a selection box along the right edge of the
report above the Detail band. The Select All method will select all
controls on the report but should show the selection handles at either end
of the line. They appear as small gray boxes at the left and right edges of
the report. If you need to see the line, be sure the line is selected, and
then choose Pen from the Format menu. Change the point size to something
other than None.
<P>
NOTE: It may be necessary to move the Detail band down to view the
selection boxes of the line, especially if the Detail band was moved up
against the invisible line in Step 8.
