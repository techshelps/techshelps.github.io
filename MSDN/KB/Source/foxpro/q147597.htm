</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When Visual FoxPro for Windows starts, a certain amount of time is used to
search and load component files, to load help files, and to turn on certain
settings. This article lists suggestions for decreasing startup time.
<P>
Most of the ideas in this article work for both network and stand-alone
computers running FoxPro.
<P>

<P>
<P><h3>Tips to Decrease Startup Time</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Use a Config.fpw file that is in the Vfp directory. If this is not
   possible, specify the full path to it by using the SET FOXPROWCFG=
   command in the Autoexec.bat file or the -c parameter on the VFP command
   line in the Properties dialog box as in this example:
<P>
   C:\VFP\VFP.EXE -cC:\OTHER\CONFIG.FPW
   SET FOXPROWCFG = C:\OTHER\CONFIG.FPW
<P>
   Here it is assumed that the Config.fpw file is located in the C:\Other
   directory. Visual FoxPro searches for this file, so it is wise to make
   the file easy to find.

<LI>Specify the location of startup files. On the Tools menu, click Options,
   and then click the File Location tab. Specify the location of the files
   in that tab. You can also place the locations in the Config.fpw file.
   Settings placed in the Config.fpw file override the settings made in the
   File Location tab. For example, place the following entries in the
   Config.fpw file:
<P>
   RESOURCE = C:\OTHER\FOXUSER.DBF
   _SPELLCHK = C:\OTHER\SHELLCHK.APP
   _WIZARD = C:\OTHER\WIZARD.APP
<P>
   NOTE: These files are normally stored in the Vfp directory.

<LI>List other files that FoxPro loads upon startup by typing DISPLAY MEMORY
   in the Visual FoxPro Command window. This listing includes other
   components of Visual FoxPro that are not in the File Locations tab.
   Visual FoxPro automatically searches for these files in the Vfp
   directory. If they are located elsewhere, give their specific location
   in the Config.fpw file as in this example:
<P>
   _TRANSPORT = C:\Other\Transport.prg
   _GENXTAB = C:\Other\Genxtab.prg
   _BUILDER = C:\Other\Builder.app

<LI>If one or more of the listed files won't be used, set them to null in
   the Config.fpw file as in this example:
<P>
   _GENXTAB = ""
   _BUILDER = ""
<P>
   This increases the startup speed of Visual FoxPro because it doesn't
   have to load these files into memory.

<LI>Make sure the location for temporary files is valid. Temporary files
   are automatically stored in the Windows temporary directory, which is
   usually C:\Windows\Temp. If the files are to be stored elsewhere,
   specify their location in the File Location tab or in the Config.fpw
   file as in this example:
<P>
   TMPFILES=C:\OTHER
   EDITWORK=C:\OTHER
   SORTWORK=C:\OTHER
   PROGWORK=C:\OTHER
<P>
   The last three items are not listed in the File Location tab reached by
   clicking Options on the Tools menu. These have to be specified in the
   Config.fpw file.

<LI>To maximize performance, you can configure some SET commands. A listing
   of these SET commands are on page 63 of Chapter 4 "Optimizing Your
   System" in the Visual FoxPro Installation Guide and Master Index book.
   You can configure them in the Config.fpw file as follows:
<P>
   DOHISTORY = OFF
   ESCAPE = ON
   OPTIMIZE = ON
