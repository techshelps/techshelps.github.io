The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You are unable to open a table that has an IDX with a name identical to the
table name.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If a CDX exists that has the same name as its table, the table cannot be
opened with an IDX that also has the same name.
<P>
For example, if you have a table named TEST.DBF, and indexes named TEST.CDX
and TEST.IDX, you will not be able to open the table.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes programs written in previous versions of FoxPro or in FoxBASE+
use IDX files instead of CDX files. These programs are likely to contain
the following code:
<P>
<PRE>   USE customer INDEX customer

</PRE>This code will open the customer database with the CUSTOMER.IDX if
CUSTOMER.CDX does not exist. If a CDX is created, subsequent execution of
this command will open customer, but no order will be set and no error will
displayed. Deleting the CUSTOMER.CDX will allow the program to function as
it previously did.
<P>
NOTE: The first time a table is opened after a CDX has been deleted the
following message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   "Structural CDX file not found"

</PRE>Choose the Ignore button to continue.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
