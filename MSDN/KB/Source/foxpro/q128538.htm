The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6, 2.6a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article shows by example how to use a READ TIMEOUT with an @SAY.
<P>
A READ in FoxPro is defined as a command that activates objects created
with @ ... GET and @ ... EDIT commands. This definition comes from the
FoxPro version 2.5b for Windows help file. However, you can also activate
an @ ... SAY in conjunction with the TIMEOUT Clause.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Create a small program, and place the following code in it:
<P>
<PRE>   *** MYSPLASH.PRG ***
   *** This sample program demonstrates the use of a READ TIMEOUT with an
   *** @...SAY command in the FoxPro versions mentioned above. ***
   @15,30 SAY "This is my Splash Screen" Font "Arial", 16
   READ TIMEOUT 3
   CLEAR

</PRE>After you run this program, the Command window will disappear, and the
words within the quotes will be displayed at the position specified in the
font specified for three seconds. Then the Command window will come back.
<P>
NOTE: A keystroke or mouse click that occurs before the three seconds is up
will also break out of the READ TIMEOUT. You could take advantage of this
feature to determine if the user is paying attention as in the following
variation of the sample program:
<P>
<PRE>   *** MYSPLASH2.PRG ***
   *** This sample program demonstrates the use of a READ TIMEOUT with an
   *** @...SAY command in the FoxPro versions mentioned above with the
   *** option to break out. ***
   Begtime = SECONDS()
   @15,30 SAY "This is my Splash Screen" Font "Arial", 16
   @17,30 SAY "Hit Any Key to Continue" Font "Arial", 16
   READ TIMEOUT 30              &amp;&amp; Will hold text for 30 seconds
   CLEAR                        &amp;&amp; Clears the screen
   Endtime = SECONDS()
   IF Endtime - Begtime &lt; 30    &amp;&amp; Determines whether the READ timed out
      DO Restofprog
   ELSE
      DO Testtocont             &amp;&amp; Procedure to double check before exiting
   ENDIF

   PROCEDURE Testtocont
   Contvar = .F.               &amp;&amp; Since timed out, initialized to False
   @15,30 SAY "Please type T to continue, or F to Quit? (T/F) " GET Contvar
   READ
   IF Contvar
      Do Restofprog
   ELSE
      QUIT                      &amp;&amp; or RETURN
   ENDIF

   PROCEDURE Restofprog
   *** This is where the program code would go ***
   Wait Window " Congratulations, you're in!"
   RETURN
</PRE>
