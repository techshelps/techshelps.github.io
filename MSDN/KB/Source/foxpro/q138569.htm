Advanced C++ Programming - Styles and Idioms
by James O. Coplien
(Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-54855-0)
<P>
<PRE>   Assuming a background in the basic syntax of C++, this book imparts
   the proficiency that expert C++ programmers gain through experience
   by giving a feel for the styles and idioms of the language. It shows
   how different styles let C++ be used for simple data abstraction, full-
   fledged abstract data type implementation, and various styles of object-
   oriented programming. It also explores idioms that the core of the C++
   language does not support, such as functional and frame-based
   programming, and advanced garbage collection techniques.

</PRE>Object-Oriented Technology: A Manager's Guide
by David A. Taylor, Ph.D.
(Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-56358-4)
<P>
<PRE>   This book is an introduction and guide to object-oriented technology
   for managers, sales people, engineers, software developers, and anyone
   interested in this technology. It explains object-oriented terminology
   and concepts. Explanations and creative illustrations make learning
   about objects enjoyable. You can become object-oriented literate in a
   couple of hours. The book translates the advantages of this technology
   into clear business benefits, allowing both managers and software
   developers to make informed decisions about the direction of their
   computing environment.

</PRE>Object-Oriented Systems Design: An Integrated Approach
by Edward Yourdon
(Yourdon Press Computing Systems, ISBN 0-13-636325-3)
<P>
<PRE>   Object-orientation (OO) is an important technology, and has already made
   an important contribution to the software engineering field. However,
   there is still a great deal to learn about OO, and a number of technical
   problems to solve. But OO, like all other technologies, does not exist
   in a vacuum; it is used within a larger context of project management
   and organizational cultures.

   The author is aware of the impact these managerial and cultural issues
   have on the success or failure of technologies such as OO, CASE
   technology, and structured methods. This perspective may help identify
   the intended audience of this book. It is not intended for the pure
   technician whose primary interest is rigorous theory and formal methods.
   Instead, it is aimed at the practitioner -- the systems developer or
   manager who has to make OO work in the real world -- a world filled with
   politics, demanding deadlines, and increasing pressure for rapid
   solutions to urgent problems.

   Because this book is concerned with analysis and design issues more than
   programming issues in C++ or Smalltalk, it will be of interest primarily
   to systems analysts, designers, software architects, and project
   managers.

</PRE>Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, Second Edition
by Grady Booch
(Benjamin/Cummings Publishing, ISBN 0-8053-5340-2)
<P>
<PRE>   The first edition of this book was instrumental in making object-
   oriented technology a practical reality. Hundreds of projects applied
   Booch's notation and process to complex problems in diverse domains. In
   this new edition, Grady Booch draws upon the rich and varied results of
   these projects to offer improved methods for object development and a
   new, unified notation. With numerous examples, all of which are now
   implemented in C++, Booch illustrates essential concepts, explains the
   method, and shows successful applications in a variety of fields. You'll
   also find pragmatic advice on a host of issues, including
   classification, implementation strategies, and cost-effective project
   management.

   This new edition uses C++ in all programming examples and applications
   and gives new examples of real-world projects, including a client/server
   architecture and an application framework.

   The book also distinguishes between good and bad object-oriented
   analysis and design and shows how to evaluate architectural tradeoffs to
   manage complexity. This is a reference for anyone who implements or
   manages object technologies, or who wishes to begin exploration of this
   important new paradigm.

</PRE>Object-Oriented Software Engineering: A Use Case Driven Approach
by Ivar Jacobson
(Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-54435-0)
<P>
<PRE>   This book is based on Objectory, which is the first commercially-
   available comprehensive object-oriented process for developing large-
   scale industrial systems. Ivar Jacobson developed Objectory as a result
   of 20 years of experience building real software-based products. This
   approach takes a global view of systems development and focuses on
   minimizing the system's life cycle cost. Objectory is an extensible
   industrial process that provides a method for building large industrial
   systems.

</PRE>Practical Applications of Object-Oriented Techniques to Relational
Databases
by Donald K. Burleson
(Wiley, ISBN 0-471-61225-1)
<P>
<PRE>   This book shows systems professionals how to apply object-oriented
   techniques to relational databases. This very practical guide provides a
   wealth of proven programming strategies and constructs that enable
   legacy databases to function within the scope of an object-technology
   application.

   The book includes dozens of real-life examples and shows how to apply
   object techniques to relational databases, including dBASE, DB2, ORACLE,
   and IDMS.

   This work is part of the Object Management Group Series on Object
   Technology and is a clearly written, nuts-and-bolts guide to object-
   oriented databases and techniques with relational databases that
   administrators, analysts, and database designers will find useful.

</PRE>Object-Orientation: Concepts, Languages, Databases, User Interfaces
by Setrag Khoshafian and Razmik Abnous
(Wiley, ISBN 0-471-51801-8)
<P>
<PRE>   A comprehensive guide to the main concepts of today's most popular
   object-oriented systems. Designed to clarify the basic concepts
   associated with object-orientation, this book provides the information
   you need to improve your programming style, regardless of whether or not
   you use an object-oriented programming language.

   It reveals the underlying commonalties of such object-oriented systems
   as programming environments, user interfaces, and database applications.
   Some of the other topics include:

    - Object-oriented system and language design paradigms, including
      abstract data types, inheritance, and object identity.

    - Implementation of object-oriented applications using practical,
      real-world examples in C++ and Ada.

    - Manifestation of object-oriented concepts in user interface design,
      including windowing systems and tool kits.

   Discussion of the emerging field of object-oriented databases, with
   particular emphasis on how object-oriented concepts and database
   capabilities are integrated in these next generation database management
   systems. Suitable for software developers, software engineers, data
   processing professionals, programmers, and students.

</PRE>Object-Oriented Information Systems: Planning and Implementation
by David A. Taylor, Ph.D.
(Wiley, ISBN 0-471-54364-0)
<P>
<PRE>   This book is aimed at the general manager who realizes that the use and
   control of total information is the key to their company's competitive
   advantage. Written in a clear, easy-to-understand manner, this guide
   cuts through the usual technojargon, enabling managers to make informed
   decisions for successful system installation and development.
   Discussions on how to purchase, build, and maintain flexible, powerful,
   and competitive object-oriented technologies. Includes a helpful fast-
   track feature that summarizes the contents of every page in the outer
   margins.

</PRE>Object Technology in Application Development
by Daniel Tkach and Richard Puttick
(Benjamin/Cummings Publishing, ISBN 0-8053-2572-7)
<P>
<PRE>   This comprehensive guide, developed at IBM's International Technical
   Support Center in San Jose, CA, is a ideal for managers and developers
   looking to apply object-oriented methods in large-scale information
   technology environments. Demonstrating the ups, downs, and trade-offs of
   object-oriented methodologies, the authors provide information that will
   help managers make choices about the resources and technologies
   available for application development.

   The book discusses the impact of object technology on management
   decisions with examples from real, full-scale environments in which
   productivity has increased from the use of this technology. This work
   covers the following:

    - Provides a solid explanation of the principles of object-oriented
      technology.

    - Describes and compares the methodologies in use in object-oriented
      development environments.

    - Analyzes the role of CASE tools in object-oriented development.

    - Presents the issues involved in building a user interface.

    - Includes a full chapter on the process of team building in
      object-oriented applications.

    - Details the use of a configuration management tool.

    - Explains how legacy code can be reused in object-oriented
      environments.

</PRE>Object Data Management: Object-Oriented and Extended Relational Database
Systems
by R.G.G. Cattell
(Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-53092-9)
<P>
<PRE>   This book is the first comprehensive introduction to the latest and most
   promising database technologies -- database systems that manipulate
   objects. Principal examples include object-oriented and extended
   relational database systems. The author, who has been active in both the
   development and the evaluation of such technologies, examines the nature
   and benefits of the new systems, compares them with conventional
   systems, and shows the range of applications they now make possible.

   Object data management is particularly useful where a large quantity of
   complex data needs to be managed, as in science and engineering,
   computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), computer-aided
   software engineering (CASE), office automation, and new approaches to
   traditional business problems. Readers will find the book valuable not
   just for learning about these technologies and their applications, but
   for evaluation the various claims being made for them.

   The author's aim is to provide a broad look at newly available database
   systems and an objective foundation on which decisions about them can be
   based. Any database system user interested in the latest technologies,
   particularly users with large amounts of complex data to manage, will
   find this book an invaluable resource. Students, designers, and
   implementers of such systems will also find it packed with useful
   information for their needs.

</PRE>Code Complete
by Steve McConnell
(Microsoft Press, ISBN 1-55615-484-4)
<P>
<PRE>   Whatever your background -- experienced developer, self-taught
   programmer, or programming student -- this ingeniously organized
   handbook contains state-of-the-art information that can help you write
   better programs in less time with fewer headaches. Code Complete is not
   a panacea, but it is an encyclopedic treatment of software construction,
   a critical part of the software-development cycle.

   It contains some 500 examples of code (good and bad) and includes
   ready-to-use checklists to help you assess your architecture, design
   approach, and module and routine quality. It also provides a larger
   perspective on the software development process and the role of
   construction in the process that will inform and stimulate your thinking
   about your own projects, enabling you to take strategic action rather
   than fight the same battles again and again.

   The concepts are applicable to any procedural language in any computing
   environment. Although Code Complete does not focus on object-oriented
   development, it does relate since logical instructions are also required
   in object-oriented development.

</PRE>Object Magazine
(Sigs Publications)
<P>
<PRE>   This monthly technical magazine focuses on object-oriented technology in
   all aspects from management, software development processes, analysis,
   design, implementation, methodology, and future trends. Many of the
   authors of the OOP books above are monthly contributors.

</PRE>Simple C++
by Jeffrey M. Cogswell
(Waite Group Press, ISBN 1-878739-44-1)
<P>
<PRE>   A quick, fun introduction to the basics of object-oriented programming.
   The first portion of each chapter covers general OOP concepts, such as
   encapsulation, inheritance, attributes and methods. The second half of
   each chapter uses actual C++ programs to illustrate points. This book
   will ease your first steps into OOP, and the C++ specifics will
   translate fairly well to other languages.
