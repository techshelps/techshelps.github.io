The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b
<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOM</h2>
 
<P>
When you are playing a movie stored in a general field, the QuickTime
object linking and embedding (OLE) server application plays the first frame
of the movie and then quits, returning the focus to the general field
window.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the movie was pasted into the general field, only a single frame of
the movie was copied to the Clipboard before pasting.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Before choosing Copy from the Edit menu, make sure you select all the
frames of the movie. You can do this in either of two ways:

<UL><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Select All.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>With the frame control positioned to the extreme left of the progress
   indicator located at the bottom of the movie window, press the
   SHIFT key and drag the frame control to the extreme right of the
   progress indicator. Release the SHIFT key.
<P>
</UL>Using either method, all frames in the movie should be selected, indicated
by the black fill of the interior of the progress indicator. Once all the
frames have been copied, return to FoxPro and paste the new contents of the
Clipboard into the general field. The single movie frame will be replaced
with the entire movie.
<P>
NOTE: There are two alternatives to the previous method of inserting a
QuickTime movie into a general field. The first alternative is to choose
Insert Object from the Edit menu. This item is available when a general
field window is the active window. For more information about the Insert
Object menu command, see page 57 of the FoxPro for Macintosh "User's
Guide."
<P>
The second method is to issue the APPEND GENERAL command in the Command
window. The syntax of this command is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>  APPEND GENERAL &lt;general field&gt;
    FROM &lt;file&gt;
    [LINK] [CLASS &lt;ole class&gt;]

</PRE>An explanation of this command can be found on page 183 of the FoxPro for
Macintosh "Language Reference." In the case of QuickTime movies, the OLE
class is "QuickTime Movie".
<P>
For example, given a QuickTime movie named QTLogo located in the Macintosh
HD:Movies subfolder and a table in the currently selected work area with a
general field named Object, you could use the following command to insert
QTLogo into the Object general field:
<P>
<PRE>  APPEND GENERAL Object ;
    FROM "Macintosh HD:Movies:QTLogo" ;
    CLASS "QuickTime Movie"

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open a table that contains a general field, or create a new one by
   typing the following command in the Command window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CREATE TABLE QTTable (Object G)
</PRE>
<P><LI>Switch back to the Finder and open the QuickTime server application,
   "QT Ole Server", which is located in the System Folder:Extensions:
   Microsoft:MS QT OLE subfolder.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open, and select a movie. Play the movie to
   be certain that the movie consists of more than a single frame.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Copy.

<P><LI>Return to FoxPro, and choose Browse from the Database menu.

<P><LI>From the Browse menu, choose Append Record.

<P><LI>Double-click the general field. A window titled "QTTable.Object"
   appears.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Paste. The first frame of the movie should
   appear in the general field.

<P><LI>Double-click the general field. The QuickTime OLE server application
   will come to the foreground to play the movie contained in the general
   field. Since only a single frame was copied to the Clipboard in step 4,
   the QuickTime OLE server application will appear for only an instant and
   then terminate.
