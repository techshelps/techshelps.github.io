<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses a recommended series of commands to clean up the
Visual FoxPro Environment at these times:
<P>
<PRE>  - When closing down the application.
  - During Transactions.
  - During Buffered Updates.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A Visual FoxPro application needs to accomplish the following items in
order to guarantee a clean Visual FoxPro environment:
<P>
<PRE>  - Clean Up During Transactions.
  - Clean Up During Buffered Updates.
  - Return Visual FoxPro to its state at startup.

</PRE>The major tasks that should be accomplished during the cleanup process are:
<P>
<PRE>  - Close down all operations.
  - Remove all objects from memory.
  - Close all private data sessions and cursors.
  - Clear the compiled program buffer.
  - Make sure Visual FoxPro reads programs from disk, not buffer.

</PRE>Details on how to accomplish these steps are outlined below.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Close Down All Operations and Return FoxPro to Its State at Startup</h3>
 
<P>
To close down all operations and return Visual FoxPro to its state at
startup, issue the following commands, in order, in the Command window:
<P>
<PRE>  CLEAR ALL
  CLOSE ALL
  CLEAR PROGRAM

</PRE>The CLEAR ALL command removes all objects from memory which, in turn, dlose
all private data sessions and cursors. The the CLOSE ALL command closes all
databases, tables, and cursors in data session 1, which is the default
Visual FoxPro data session. Then the CLEAR PROGRAM command clears the
compiled program buffer of the most recently executed programs, and it
forces Visual FoxPro to read the programs from disk, rather than from the
program buffer.
<P>
<P><h3>Special Consideration: Cleaning Up During Transactions</h3>
 
<P>
If transactions are in progress, use the END TRANSACTION command for each
level of transaction before issuing the the CLEAR ALL, CLOSE ALL, and CLEAR
PROGRAM commands.
<P>
<P><h3>Special Consideration: Cleaning Up During Buffered Updates</h3>
 
<P>
If buffered updates are in progress, use either the TABLEUPDATE() or
TABLEREVERT() functions for each cursor with buffered updates before
issuing the CLEAR ALL, CLOSE ALL, and CLEAR PROGRAM commands.
