</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After doing an Administrative Install with a SETUP /A, the SETUP.EXE
program is executed from the directory where the SETUP /A installed files,
but the Workstation Installation button is not displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If a third-party shell is installed, the Workstation Installation option
may fail to appear.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The problem can be resolved by changing the default shell back to Program
Manager by changing the SHELL= line in the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Normally when the SETUP.EXE is run from the directory where a SETUP /A
installed files, there should be three installation options buttons:
<P>
<PRE>   Complete Installation
   Custom Installation
   Workstation Installation

</PRE>However, if a third-party shell is installed, the Workstation Installation
option may fail to appear. The problem can be resolved by changing the
default shell back to Program Manager.
