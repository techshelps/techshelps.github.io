<P><h3>Network Setup</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. How do I perform an Administrative Setup of FoxPro for
<P><PRE>       Macintosh on a network?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. In a network environment, you first must install FoxPro on the
       server by using the Administrative Setup option. Administrative
       Setup decompresses all the FoxPro for Macintosh files and the
       Setup files onto the network drive (volume), marking the FoxPro
       files as read-only (locked). Once FoxPro is installed on the
       server, you can then set up each workstation by using the
       Workstation Setup option. Workstation Setup copies the FoxPro
       resource files FOXUSER.DBF and FOXUSER.FPT to the local disk.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       To perform an Administrative Setup, do the following:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Insert Disk 1 of the Microsoft FoxPro Setup disks.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       2. Open the disk and then double-click or open Microsoft FoxPro
<PRE></PRE>          Setup.

       3. Enter your name and organization, and confirm the
          information as directed.

       4. In the Installation dialog box, choose Network to perform an
          Administrative Setup.

       5. Specify how Microsoft FoxPro is to be installed on the
          network. You can choose whether the Workstation Setup will
          set up Microsoft FoxPro to run a private copy from the local
          workstation or a shared copy from the server.

       During Setup, you will be prompted for an installation folder.
       For more information, see "Instructions for Administrative
       Setup" in the "Installation and Macintosh Features Guide" for
       FoxPro for Macintosh.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. How do I perform a Workstation Setup of FoxPro on a
<P><PRE>       network?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. To set up individual workstations, use the Workstation Setup
       option, which requires a previous Administrative Setup. The
       Workstation Setup option sets up a workstation to run either 1)
       a private copy of FoxPro for Macintosh by performing a full
       installation on the workstation, or 2) a shared network copy of
       FoxPro for Macintosh by copying FoxPro initialization files and
       extensions, and creating an application icon on the
       workstation.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       You can perform a Workstation Setup from the network drive.
       Open the network drive, open a window with the correct network
       path for FoxPro for Macintosh, then run Microsoft FoxPro Setup.
       In the Microsoft FoxPro Installation dialog box, choose the
       Network button.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       During Setup, you will be prompted for user information and an
       installation directory, default drive, path name, and so on.
       For more information, see "Instructions for Workstation Setup"
       in the "Installation and Macintosh Features Guide" for FoxPro
       for Macintosh.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What network rights do I need to install FoxPro on a
<P><PRE>       network?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. You need full network system rights in order to install on a
       network. Contact your system administrator for further
       information about your specific installation.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why are workstation users on our network unable to use
<P><PRE>       FoxPro's graphing and spell-checking capabilities?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. To use these features, workstation users need at least read-
       access rights to the MSGRAPH and PROOF subfolders. Contact your
       system administrator regarding user access to these subfolders.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>General Setup</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. What changes does FoxPro for Macintosh make to my System
<P><PRE>       Folder?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The following files are updated in the Shared Code folder: OLE
       Client Dll, OLE Reg Dll, OLE Server Dll, and Shared Code
       Manager.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       FoxPro adds FOXDOC.MLB, FOXTOOLS.MLB, MACIMP.MLB, and
       RESERVED.MLB to the System Folder:Extensions folder.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       FoxPro's graphing capabilities require that the Microsoft Graph
       and Microsoft Graph Help files be stored in the folder System
       Folder:Extensions:Microsoft:MSGraph.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       FoxPro's spell-checking capabilities require that the Spelling
       and MS US English Dictionary files be stored in the folder
       System Folder:Extensions:Microsoft:Spelling.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I accidentally deleted some of the FoxPro sample files.
<P><PRE>       Can I reinstall these files without reinstalling FoxPro?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Yes. Run Setup again and choose Custom Installation from the
       Microsoft FoxPro Installation dialog box. This lets you choose
       the components you want to install.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I'm having difficulty reading the FoxPro disks because of
<P><PRE>       an alignment problem with my floppy disk drive. Is there
       another option for installation?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Copy all the files to a directory on your hard disk and then
       run the FoxPro installation from the hard disk instead of the
       floppy disk.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I'm having difficulty installing FoxPro. I'm not running
<P><PRE>       any other applications at the same time.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. If you are having installation problems, make certain you have
       disabled all extensions (INITs). You can turn off all
       extensions by holding down the SHIFT key while you restart your
       system. You will see the message "Welcome to Macintosh -
       Extensions off."
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why does the Installation program keep asking me to insert
<P><PRE>       Disk 1 when it really needs another disk?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. When a disk change during installation is required, the current
       disk will be ejected and you will be asked to insert Disk 1 if
       you have an extension (INIT) that enhances the Open and Save
       dialog boxes. After you insert Disk 1, it may or may not eject
       the disk and ask you to insert the appropriate disk. To avoid
       this problem, you can press COMMAND+SHIFT+1 to eject the disk,
       and then insert the correct disk, or you can run the
       installation program with extensions turned off.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Configuration</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. I get the error message "Insufficient memory" when trying
<P><PRE>       to load FoxPro for Macintosh. How do I correct this problem?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The Macintosh Finder(TM) allows you to change the amount of RAM
       allocated to an application. To change the amount of RAM
       available to Microsoft FoxPro, quit FoxPro and make the Finder
       the active program. Select the Microsoft FoxPro application
       icon in the Microsoft FoxPro folder. From the File menu, choose
       Get Info. A dialog box appears displaying a variety of
       information about the file. In the lower-right corner,
       information about the "Suggested" and "Current" size of the
       application is displayed. In the Current size box, enter a
       value that is greater than or equal to the suggested size. This
       amount can be less than or equal to the largest unused block of
       memory available to application programs. To determine this
       amount, choose About This Macintosh from the Apple menu. The
       dialog box that appears reveals this amount. It is not
       recommended that you specify a current size less than the
       suggested size. Attempting to run Microsoft FoxPro with too
       little memory may considerably degrade performance. For more
       information, see the "Optimizing Your System" section of the
       "Installation and Macintosh Features Guide." For more
       information about managing memory on the Apple Macintosh, see
       the related section in your "Macintosh User's Guide."
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What factors influence FoxPro's startup speed?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. The time required to load and start FoxPro relates to the
       physical size of FoxPro, the number of items that must be
       sought at startup, and other factors. Many of these items are
       under your control. For a complete discussion of these issues,
       refer to the "Optimizing Your System" section of the
       "Installation and Macintosh Features Guide."
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why do I have several files with the extension .TMP on my
<P><PRE>       hard disk?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Every time you run Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, it creates
       temporary (.TMP) files. These files are automatically deleted
       when you quit FoxPro with a normal shutdown. However, the .TMP
       files will not be deleted if you restart the machine while
       FoxPro is running or if you don't have file-deletion rights in
       the directory where the files reside. To remove the .TMP files,
       quit FoxPro, acquire file-deletion rights for the directory
       where the .TMP files are, and then manually delete the .TMP
       files.
