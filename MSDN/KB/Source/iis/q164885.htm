The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Internet Information Server, versions 2.0 and 3.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the service dependencies of the Microsoft Internet
Information Server (IIS) WWW (http), FTP, and Gopher services with the
default Windows NT services.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are certain cases in which it may be desirable to disable particular
services on a Windows NT installation. This article describes the minimum
windows NT services that are required for the IIS services to function and
will explore some of considerations that must be taken before employing
these methods. These methods are used to increase the security of an IIS
installation through the limitation of available services.
<P>
**********WARNING**********
<P>
Extreme care must be taken when disabling NT services because specific
functionality is provided by each windows NT service. You must thoroughly
understand the implications of changing particular service startup values.
This text is not a comprehensive discussion of all Windows NT services but
a guideline for particular services that are required for the IIS services
to function. You WILL lose or limit certain features of IIS functionality
when particular services are disabled. For this reason, these methods may
not apply to your particular Windows NT installation nor be desirable in
your implementation of IIS. These suggestions should be thoroughly tested
on a another computer or in a test lab prior to implementation on
production servers. Additionally, you may have other services installed
that are not covered in this test that have dependencies that are outside
the scope of this article.
<P>
If the desired functionality of an IIS computer is only to only provide IIS
services. In the context of this article IIS or IIS services refers to WWW,
FTP, or Gopher services. The following default services in addition to the
IIS service you are implementing are needed for base IIS functionality.
<P>
At least one of the following:

<UL><LI>Gopher Publishing Service: Optional
<LI>FTP Publishing Service: Optional
<LI>World Wide Web Publishing Service: Optional
<P>
</UL>All of the following:

<UL><LI>EventLog: Required
<LI>NT LM Security Support Provider: Required
<LI>Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service: Required
<P>
</UL>These represent the minimum configuration needed for the IIS services to
function. You will in most probability need to ensure some of the following
services are functioning for normal server operation. Each of the default
services found in a Windows NT installation will be discussed next and the
specific functionality used by the IIS services will be described.
<P>
Services marked with an asterisk will cause loss of functionality if
disabled; disabling these services may be detrimental to overall server
functionality.
<P>
Services marked with a hyphen have no dependency relationship with IIS or
may have little server impact if disabled.
<P>
**********WARNING**********
<P>
Care should be taken before altering the startup values of these services.
These services may have complex dependencies with other services not listed
here.
<P>
You MUST understand what functionality is provided by these services before
changing the settings.
<P>
Improper changes of services will risk the loss of needed capabilities or
server functionality.
<P>
**********WARNING**********

<UL><LI>Alerter: Not Required. No IIS dependency

<LI>Clip Book Viewer: Not Required. No IIS dependency

<LI>*Computer Browser: Recommended. If disabled, no browse list will be
   available and no computer browsing will be allowed. You must know the
   network path on remote computers.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: The Computer Browser service must be running in order for the
computer to have the capability to become a master or backup browser,
however it has nothing to do with whether or not a computer announces
itself on the network. As long as the Server service is running, and the
computer is not hidden, a Windows NT computer will make Host Announcements.
If a master or backup browser in the same domain or workgroup receives
these Announcements, the computer making the Announcements will be added to
the server list, and clients will see it in the list when they browse the
workgroup or domain.

<UL><LI>*EventLog: Recommended. This logs server operation. You will receive
   alerts logged by disabling some of these services that are not required
   for base functionality.

<LI>*DHCP Client: Not Required if all Network interfaces use a static IP
   address.

<LI>*Directory Replicator: Not Required. No IIS dependency. However,
   directory replication will not take place if this is disabled. This is a
   common services to use on large multi-server web installations to
   synchronize Web content across servers.

<LI>Messenger:  Not Required. No IIS dependency

<LI>*Net Logon: Recommended. If you want Windows NT domain or remote logins
   this service must to be enabled. There will be few cases where it is
   desirable to disable this service.

<LI>Network DDE: Not Required. No IIS dependency

<LI>Network Monitor Agent: Not Required. No IIS dependency

<LI>*NT LM Security Support Provider: Required for security and RPC
   implementation. There will not be any cases when you will want to
   disable this service.

<LI>Plug &amp; Play: Not Required. No IIS dependency

<LI>*Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Locator: Recommended. Not required, unless
   you are doing remote administration from computer. This is what IIS uses
   to register computers available for remote administration. This can be
   disabled if remote administration is not desired. In most cases you will
   not disable this service as other this is a commonly used by
   administrative tools and some applications. Take care when disabling
   this service.

<LI>*Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service: Required. It is not recommended
   you pause or stop this service in any IIS installation.

<LI>*Server Service: Recommended. This service provides SMB server services.
   Other services are dependent on this services Some of these include
   Computer Browser, replication services, network logon and RAS service.
   Note that you will need to start it if you want to run User Manager

<LI>Simple TCP/IP Services: Not Required. No IIS dependency.

<LI>Spooler: Not Required. No IIS dependency.

<LI>*TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper: Recommended for NetBIOS support and name
   resolution. Disabling this service will also disable Computer Browser
   and Net Logon services. It is not recommended to disable this service in
   most cases.

<LI>Telephony Service: Not Required unless access is via dial-up.

<LI>UPS: Recommended for mission-critical servers.

<LI>*Workstation: Recommended. Disabling this service shuts down the network
   redirector. You must use this service if you are using UNC paths or
   making network shares available via the IIS services. It is not normally
   recommended to disable this service.
<P>
</UL>There are many other services you may have installed, such as the Remote
Access Service, DHCP, DNS, or WINS service that you may need to enable that
are not covered here for particular implementations of IIS. Consult the
Windows NT Server resource kit or product documentation for more complete
descriptions of particular Windows NT services. Your needs must be
carefully considered before changing the default state of any of the
described services. The preceding list provides only a minimal guide to the
requirements of a particular IIS server installation. Your requirements and
mileage may vary especially in an Intranet scenario where services such as
WINS, DHCP and DNS may be necessary.

suggestions on production servers:
