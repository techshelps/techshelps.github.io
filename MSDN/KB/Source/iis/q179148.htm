The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Personal Web Server version 4.0 on Microsoft Windows NT
   Workstation version 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has been made aware of an issue in Internet Information Server
(IIS) 4.0 and Personal Web Server (PWS) 4.0 in which certain configuration
settings may not be applied when a URL with short file name equivalents is
requested. These configuration setting include restricting access by IP
address, PICS ratings, and requiring SSL encryption. Windows NT file
permissions (ACLs) are not affected.
<P>
Users are able to access certain directories or files through IIS 4.0 or
PWS 4.0 and bypass specific security settings, such as SSL encryption.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT and Windows 95 file systems (FAT, FAT32, and NTFS) support
file names of up to 255 characters. To maintain compatibility with older,
non 32-bit applications, a short file name (called the 8.3 file name) is
created for each file. This short file name equivalent is used by older
applications to access directories and files with long names.
IIS 4.0 and PWS 4.0 maintain certain configuration information about
directories and files in a database called the metabase. The metabase does
not contain file permissions, but rather Web server-specific information
such as requiring SSL encryption, proxy cache setting, and PICS ratings.
Actual file and directory permissions are enforced by NTFS and are not
affected by this problem.
<P>
In certain cases when a URL is requested using the short file name, it is
possible that configuration properties specified in the metabase may not be
applied as expected. This issue only occurs where long file names are used
for directories or files, and specific metabase configuration properties
are set on those directories or files. File permissions by a user or group
using NTFS access control lists (ACL) are not affected.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: The supported fix is for IIS and PWS on Windows NT Workstation. A fix
for PWS on Microsoft Windows 95 is still pending.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet
Information Server version 4.0 and Personal Web Server version 4.0.
<P>
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
<P>
The fix is available at the following location:
