<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains the Frequently Asked Questions for the Microsoft
Windows Internet Information Server (IIS).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
QUESTION:
<P>
Am I required to type the header, "<B>http://</B>", for a web file open request
from the client browsers that are included with the Microsoft Internet
Information Server?
<P>
ANSWER:
<P>
No. The default file open header, "<B>http://</B>", is used on the Microsoft
Internet Explorer client browsers. This means that on you can simply type
in the destination address, such as "www.microsoft.com", and the default
web request header "<B>http://</B>" will be added automatically.
<P>
QUESTION:
<P>
Can I install the Microsoft Internet Information Server over the Microsoft
Windows NT FTP service?
<P>
ANSWER:
<P>
Microsoft recommends that you remove the installation of Microsoft Windows
NT FTP service before installing the Microsoft Internet Information Server
FTP service. For more information see Knowledge Base article <B><A HREF="../IIS/Q142555.htm">Q142555</A></B>.
<P>
QUESTION:
<P>
How can I test my installation of the Microsoft Internet Information Server
<P>
World Wide Web Service on my local LAN?
<P>
ANSWER:
<P>
The default installation of the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)
<P>
contains sample files that can be used to test the functionality of your
IIS WWW publication service.

<UL><LI>Ensure your computer has an active connection to your local LAN and that
   your name resolution is working properly.

<LI>Make sure the WWW service is started by opening  Microsoft Internet
   Service Manager and verifying  State is "Running".

<LI>Start the Microsoft Internet Explorer.

<LI>Click on File, Open or use the File Open icon on the toolbar.

<LI>Type in the Uniform Resource Location (URL) for the home directory of
   your new server. The URL will be "<B>http://</B>" followed by the NetBIOS name
   of your server. For example if your server is called, "myserver" you
   would type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B>http://myserver</B>
</PRE>
<LI>You should see a sample HTML page. If not you may be publishing from a
   previous installation directory. In that case use the full path to
   access the sample page such as:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B>http://myserver/samples.</B>
</PRE><P>
</UL>For more information see Knowledge Base article <B><A HREF="../IIS/Q142556.htm">Q142556</A></B>.
<P>
QUESTION:
<P>
Can I run the Microsoft Internet Information Server on the Windows NT Shell
<P>
Technology Preview?
<P>
ANSWER:
<P>
The Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 has not been thoroughly
tested for use on the Microsoft Windows NT Shell Technology Preview.
Microsoft does not recommend the use of the Internet Information Server 1.0
<P>
running on the Microsoft Windows NT Shell Technology Preview in a
production environment. For more information see Knowledge Base article
<B><A HREF="../IIS/Q142713.htm">Q142713</A></B>.
<P>
QUESTION:
<P>
When I attempt an Anonymous HTTP connection to my Microsoft Internet
Information Server World Wide Web service my client browser receives the
following error:
<P>
<PRE>   HTTP/1.0 500 Server Error (Logon failure: the user has not been granted

   the requested logon type at this computer. )

</PRE>ANSWER:
<P>
Frequently this error means an that your anonymous user does not have local
<P>
logon rights. To resolve this problem:

<UL><LI>In the Microsoft Internet Service Manager open the WWW Service
   Properties.

<LI>Verify the Anonymous Logon Username and Password.

<LI>Verify that the username and password in the WWW Service Properties has
   an identical username and password used in User Manager.

<LI>Run User Manager to verify the local logon rights for your designated
   anonymous user.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Run the Microsoft Internet Service Manager to change your anonymous
   logon user to an account that does have local logon rights. Verifying
   the same username and password as used in User Manager. For more
   information see Knowledge Base article <B><A HREF="../IIS/Q142715.htm">Q142715</A></B>.
<P>
</UL>QUESTION:
<P>
How can I add mime types to the Microsoft Internet Information Server?
<P>
ANSWER:
<P>
Mime types allow files to be opened by "helper" applications on web browser
<P>
clients, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. Currently, mime types for
Internet Information Server (IIS) must be added manually to the registry.
Mime entries can be added to the following registry location:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\InetInfo\MimeMap

</PRE>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
Note that a helper application may have to be configured on the client as
well.
<P>
For more information see Knowledge Base article <B><A HREF="../IIS/Q142558.htm">Q142558</A></B>, and the Microsoft
Internet Information Server help file, INETMGR.HLP.
<P>
QUESTION:
<P>
Is UNICODE supported on the Microsoft Internet Information Server?
<P>
ANSWER:
<P>
UNICODE is not currently supported on the Microsoft Internet Information
Server.
<P>
If you save an HTM file from Notepad or any other editor that supports
Unicode you may see strange characters on your browser when accessing that
specific page.
<P>
Be sure to select Save as, Save File as Type, Text Files (*.txt), when
editing/saving any HTM file for use on the Microsoft Internet Information
Server from Notepad. For more information see Knowledge Base article
<B><A HREF="../IIS/Q142605.htm">Q142605</A></B>.
<P>
QUESTION:
<P>
When I use the Internet Explorer version 1.5 to access my IIS server I
receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Error: Authentication is required for this document. The server did
   not specify a supported authentication method."

</PRE>How can I resolve this issue?
<P>
ANSWER:
<P>
A potential cause is that you have set the Password Authentication on the
Microsoft Internet Information Server to a level that is not supported on
your Internet Explorer client. The Windows NT Internet Explorer 1.5 Client
currently supports Anonymous and Basic Authentication. Install the Windows
95 Internet Explorer 2.0 Client for Windows NT Challenge/Response
Authentication. For more information see Knowledge Base article <B><A HREF="../IIS/Q142702.htm">Q142702</A></B>.
<P>
QUESTION:
<P>
When I attempt to configure services in Internet Server Manager, the
following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The service has not been started.

</PRE>ANSWER:
<P>
Stopped services cannot be configured in Internet Server Manager because
configuration is done through the server's RPC interface, which is only
available when the service is running. Start the service in question. If
configuration changes are made, choose Apply to make the new settings take
effect. For more information see Knowledge Base article <B><A HREF="../IIS/Q140049.htm">Q140049</A></B>.
<P>
QUESTION:
<P>
How can I use the Internet Explorer FTP client to PUT a file to an IIS
server?
<P>
ANSWER:
<P>
You cannot find a PUT option in Internet Explorer. You can successfully
download files using the FTP option from Internet Explorer but you cannot
upload files to a remote FTP server. Internet Explorer, like many other Web
<P>
browsers, does not currently have FTP PUT capability. Use a standard FTP
program to write files to a remote FTP server. For more information see
Knowledge Base article <B><A HREF="../IIS/Q142851.htm">Q142851</A></B>.
<P>
QUESTION:
<P>
When I use my FTP browser client, I am unable to see virtual directories
created in Internet Server Manager for the FTP service even though I have
permissions to access the directory. How can I resolve this issue?
<P>
ANSWER:
<P>
Internet Information Server does not have this capability at this time. To
resolve this issue, discover the names of the directories on the FTP server
<P>
and use the change directory command (CD) to access these directories.
<P>
-or-
<P>
From a Microsoft Internet Explorer Client, use the alias name associated
with the virtual directory to gain access. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   FTP://myserver/virdir

</PRE>where "virdir" is the name of the alias assigned to an FTP virtual
directory. For more information see Knowledge Base article <B><A HREF="../IIS/Q142853.htm">Q142853</A></B>.
<P>
QUESTION:
<P>
Does the Microsoft Internet Information Server provide an Unattended Setup
option?
<P>
ANSWER:
<P>
Microsoft Internet Information Server does provides an option for
unattended setup mode. By using a small script, you can set up multiple
information servers quickly and easily. You can customize the unattended
setup for several servers or to provide a simple process for over-the-
network installations for Internet Explorer users. To customize the
unattended setup, the file, UNATTEND.TXT, (located on the Internet Server
compact disc) must first be copied to your hard drive and modified to meet
your configuration requirements. The file contains more specific
instructions on what values are configurable. To start unattended mode
Setup, at the command prompt, first change to the directory containing both
<P>
the SETUP.EXE and UNATTEND.TXT. Then, type:
<P>
<PRE>   SETUP -B UNATTEND.TXT

</PRE>For more information see Knowledge Base article <B><A HREF="../IIS/Q142860.htm">Q142860</A></B>.
<P>
QUESTION:
<P>
How can I create HTML documents to use on my Microsoft Internet Information
<P>
Server for WWW publications?
<P>
ANSWER:
<P>
HTML Documents for WWW servers can be written on any text editor as long as
<P>
you know the proper HTML syntax. However, HTML documents can be easily
produced using an HTML editor such as Internet Assistant for Microsoft
Word. Internet Assistant for Microsoft Word is available on
www.microsoft.com. There are also numerous shareware HTML editors available
on the Internet. For more information see Knowledge Base article <B><A HREF="../IIS/Q143152.htm">Q143152</A></B>.
<P>
QUESTION:
<P>
I cleared the Allow Anonymous Connection check box and disabled the use of
the guest account for FTP (as recommended in IIS setup). Now, any request
to access the FTP server from an Internet Explorer client results in the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The attempt to load 'ftp//servername' failed.

</PRE>If I use a Command Prompt based client, I am able to login using a Windows
NT username and password. How can I resolve this issue?
<P>
ANSWER:
<P>
As a workaround the user should enter a URL similar to the following to
access a non-guest, non-anonymous IIS FTP server:
<P>
<PRE>   FTP://username:password@myserver.com

</PRE>where:
<P>
<PRE>   "username" is the Windows NT user account name
   "password" is the NT password associated with the user account name
   "myserver.com" is the name of the NT server

</PRE>WARNING: FTP usernames and passwords are sent across the network in clear
text. When the IIS administrator has cleared the Allow Anonymous Connection
<P>
check box or the Allow Only Anonymous Connections check box, Windows NT
usernames and passwords are sent to the server without encryption. These
options are enabled by default for security reasons.
