</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Internet Information Server contains four registry keys. They are FTP,
Gopher, WWW (World Wide Web), and the Internet Information Server (IIS).
<P>
The Internet Information Server registry key provides registry parameters
and values that are global for the InetInfo process and the server. The
registry keys for FTP, Gopher, and WWW use few similar parameters and
values, but are used independent of each other.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Internet Information servers share a common portion of registry in the
following location for InetInfo process. These parameters and their values
are used for global control of the Internet Information Server.
<P>
The parameter location is under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree under the
following subkeys:
<P>
<PRE>   \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\InetInfo\Parameters

BandwidthLevel                                  REG_DWORD
Range:  0 - 0xFFFFFFFF                          Default:0xFFFFFFFF
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>This specifies the amount of bandwidth on the network the IIS can use. The
server comes with an automatic bandwidth throttler which makes intelligent
decisions to meet user requirements. This helps reduce overloading the
network too much of Gibraltar server activities. For administrators of
small corporate servers, where a single server is used for multiple sites,
this will help reduce network usage for IIS. It is recommended that this
parameter be set from the Internet Server Admin Manager. Otherwise the
server should be stopped and restarted for this value to take effect. A
special value of 0xFFFFFFFF means no throttling should be done.
<P>
<PRE>MemoryCacheSize                                 REG_DWORD
Range:  0 - 0xFFFFFFFF                          Default:3072000 (3MB)
Description:                                    CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>IIS server caches system handles, directory listings, and several blobs
(Binary Large Objects) of frequently used data to improve performance of
the system. This parameter specifies the amount of memory in bytes to
allocate for such a cache. This cannot be configured using Admin Manager.
When changed, the server must be stopped and restarted for this to take
effect. A special value of 0 means do not do any caching. The performance
may be low when caching is shut out. Certain sites experiencing high file
traffic can increase this size if there is sufficient RAM on the system.
<P>
<PRE>ObjectCacheTTL                                  REG_DWORD
Range:  0 - 0x7FFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF              Default:10*60(10Minutes)
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

</PRE>Objects in the Memory Cache will be phased out of the cache if there have
been no references to an object after this period. If system memory is
limited, a lower TTL may be useful to prevent non-paged memory being used
for cached file handles. A value of 0xFFFFFFFF disables the object cache
scavenger. Units are in seconds.
<P>
<PRE>UserTokenTTL                                    REG_DWORD Range:  0 -
0x7FFFFFFF                                      Default: 15*60 (10Minutes)
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

</PRE>When a request is made to the server, the security credentials for the
request (or the configured anonymous user) are used to create a user token
on the server which the server impersonates when accessing files or other
system resources. The token is cached so the NT logon only takes place the
first time the user accesses the system or after the user's token has
fallen out of the cache. NTLM authentication tokens are not cached. Units
are in seconds.
<P>
<PRE>LogFileBatchSize                                REG_DWORD
Range:          0 - 0xFFFFFFFF                  Default:64*1024 (64KB)
Description:                                    CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>This specifies the batch size for writing log file. The server caches the
last LogFileBatchSize bytes of data in memory buffers before it dumps the
current buffer and moves onto the next buffer. Such batch processing
reduces the amount of disk traffic created by log files. However, if a site
is interested in getting the current-up-to-date log records flushed to disk
the batch size can be reduced.
<P>
<PRE>MaxPoolThreads                                  REG_DWORD
Range:  0 - 0xFFFFFFFF                          Default:10
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

</PRE>MaxPoolThreads specifies the number of pool threads to create per
processor. Each pool thread watches for the network request and processes
the same. Generally it is not good to create more than 20 threads per
processor.
<P>
<PRE>MaxConcurrency                                  REG_DWORD
Range:  0 - 0xFFFFFFFF                          Default:0
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

</PRE>MaxConcurrency specifies the amount of concurrency that a system should
provide. We use completion ports for handling IO. In general it is not good
to have more than one thread running and conflicting on shared memory or
locks. This parameter specifies how many threads per processor should be
allowed to run simultaneously if there is a pending IO operation. The
specific value of 0 allows system to make intelligent choice of the number
of threads to use. Any non-zero value specifies that the system should
allow that many threads per processor to run simultaneously.
<P>
<PRE>ThreadTimeout                                   REG_DWORD
Range:  0 - 0xFFFFFFFF                          Default:24*60*60 (24 hours)
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

</PRE>ThreadTimeout specifies the amount of time an IO processing thread should
be maintained even if there is no IO on the system. In general when there
is no IO activity and no requests outstanding, the server is idle and does
not consume memory. But if that situation prolongs and exceeds the
ThreadTimeout interval, then the thread is killed. Unit is in seconds.
<P>
<PRE>UseAcceptEx                                     REG_DWORD
Range:  0, 1                                    Default:1
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

</PRE>Starting with NT 3.51 SP2 we have a new facility to listen and establish
connections at the server side. AcceptEx() provides a cheap way to accept
and receive an initial chunk of data on a new incoming connection. By
default the server uses this method to accept new connections. If, for
experimental purposes one decides to turn off using this fast IO path, then
this value can be set to 0. However, setting to 0 may cause potential
performance degradation.
<P>
<PRE>AcceptExOutstanding                             REG_DWORD
Range:  0-1000                                  Default:40
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

</PRE>When using AcceptEx(), certain number of sockets should be maintained to
receive and process new connections. This parameter specifies the number of
such outstanding connections to maintain. Whenever the number of
outstanding sockets fall below this range, the server adds additional
sockets to bring it back to this level.
<P>
<PRE>AcceptExTimeout                                 REG_DWORD
Range:  0-0xFFFFFFFF                            Default:120
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

</PRE>AcceptExTimeout specifies the time an accept ex socket is allowed to be
waiting for a receive to complete, before the server blows away the long-
waiting connection. This helps to reduce the number of outstanding sockets
and hence conserve the system memory usage. Units is in seconds.
<P>
<PRE>MimeMap                                         Key
Description:                                    CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>This is a subkey that contains all the virtual roots for a service.
<P>
<PRE>DebugFlags                                      REG_DWORD
Range:  0 - 0xFFFFFFFF                          Default:0
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

</PRE>DebugFlags specifies the bit mask for selectively enabling different checks
in a debug binary of the server common dll (INFOCOMM.DLL). This bit mask
applies to the common dll only.
<P>
<PRE>#define DEBUG_ERROR                                     0x00000008L

</PRE><h3>Per Service Registry Parameters</h3>
 
<P>
Each of the Internet Information services have per service registry
configurations. There are several parameters which have the same name, but
different per-service values. The values are used on a per service basis.
Below is a description of all such common-named registry parameters
applicable to all services followed by service specific registry
parameters.
<P>
<P><h3>Commonly Named Per Service Parameters</h3>
 
<P>
The parameters are located under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree under the
following subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\&lt;ServiceName&gt;\Parameters

</PRE>where &lt;ServiceName&gt; is:
<P>
<PRE>   MSFTPSVC                                FTP Service
   GOPHERSVC                               Gopher Service
   W3SVC                                   HTTP Service

AdminName                                       REG_SZ
Range:  String                                  Default:Administrator
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>AdminName specifies the user friendly administrator name. Gopher service
uses this name to send back responses for Gopher queries. It also serves as
a way of identifying who owns a service using IIS manager.
<P>
<PRE>AdminEmail                                      REG_SZ
Range:  String                                  Default:Admin@corp.com
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>AdminEmail specifies the email address for administrator of a particular
service. Gopher service uses this name to send back responses for Gopher+
queries. It also serves as a way of identifying who owns a service using
IIS manager.
<P>
<PRE>ServerComment                                   REG_SZ
Range:  String                                  Default: ""
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>Specifies a user-friendly comment for a service. This information is
supplied to the IIS manager and is used to add configurable comment about
a server.
<P>
<PRE>EnableSvcLoc                                    REG_DWORD
Range:  0, 1                                    Default:1
Description:                                    CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>IIS Services register themselves with a service locator so the service
can be discovered by administrative utility and clients. This parameter
controls such registration. If it is set to 0, then the service will forego
registration of the service. Otherwise, it registers the service for
service location. Administrators planning on having a private server should
consider setting the value of this parameter to 0.
<P>
<PRE>AllowAnonymous                                  REG_DWORD
Range:  0, 1                                    Default: 1
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>This flag specifies if an anonymous user should be allowed to connect and
make a request to the server. By nature, most Internet protocols allow
anonymous connections to access a limited set of files. Hence, it is
essential to permit anonymous connections.
<P>
<PRE>AnonymousOnly                                   REG_DWORD
Range:  0, 1                                    Default: 0
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>AnonymousOnly specifies if only anonymous connection should be permitted.
If this flag is turned on no non-anonymous connections are permitted
(especially true of FTP server).
<P>
<PRE>AnonymousUserName                               REG_SZ
Range:  String                                  Default: Guest
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>AnonymousUserName specifies the name of the local user account to use for
anonymous users. Server impersonates as a particular user to access the
files so that the file system security model is leveraged. This parameter
should not be changed by itself. It should be configured using the IIS
Admin Manager so that the appropriate password can also be set. The
password is stored in a protected area in the registry.
<P>
<PRE>ConnectionTimeOut                               REG_DWORD
Range:  0-0xFFFFFFFF                            Default: 600 seconds
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>Specifies the time the server should hold on to a connection when there is
no activity on the same. Server automatically disconnects long hanging
connections. Units: seconds.
<P>
<PRE>LogAnonymous                                    REG_DWORD
Range:  0, 1                                    Default: 1
Description:                                    CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>This flag controls if a log record should be written for anonymous
connections. If set to 0, no log records are written for anonymous
connections.
<P>
<PRE>LogNonAnonymous                                 REG_DWORD
Range:  0, 1                                    Default: 1
Description:                                    CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>This flag controls if a log record should be written for non-anonymous
connections. If set to 0, no log records are written for non-anonymous
connections. Only FTP and HTTP services have non-anonymous user support.
<P>
<PRE>LogFileDirectory                  REG_EXPAND_SZ
Range:  String                    Default: %systemroot%\system32\logfiles
Description:                      ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>This string specifies the directory in which log files are to be stored.
Each service generates a log record for each request processed.
<P>
<PRE>LogFilePeriod                                   REG_DWORD
Range:  0,1,2,3                                 Default: 1
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>This specifies an internal value for request logging module. The value
specifies the type of log files to be produced.
<P>
0    No period. The logfile size is limited to LogFileTruncateSize bytes.
1   Open a new log file each day - Daily
2   Open a new log file every week - Weekly
3   Open a new log file every month - Monthly
<P>
<PRE>LogFileTruncateSize                             REG_DWORD
Range:  0-0xFFFFFFFF                            Default: 4,000,000,000
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>This value specifies the maximum size of each log file generated. Once this
size is reached, the logging module automatically opens a new log file. A
special value of 0 means do not truncate.
<P>
<PRE>LogSqlDataSources                               REG_SZ
Range:  String                                  Default:""
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>This string specifies the name of the ODBC data source to use for sending
the request logs for the service to a SQL compatible database system. This
data source should be a system DSN in the ODBC installation on server
machine.
<P>
<PRE>LogSqlTableName                                 REG_SZ
Range:  String                                  Default:""
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>This string specifies the name of the ODBC table name use for sending the
request logs for the service to a SQL compatible database system. The table
should be created by the administrator as per the specification provided
with the services. The user should also have proper access permissions to
insert into table.
<P>
<PRE>LogSqlUserName                                  REG_SZ
Range:  String                                  Default:""
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

</PRE>This string specifies the user name to use for talking to the ODBC data
source specified for ODBC based logging. This user should be a valid user
on the database system to which the LogSqlDataSource is pointing to.
