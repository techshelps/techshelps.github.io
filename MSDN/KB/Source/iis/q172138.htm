<P>
 
The information in this article applies to: 

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Each of the Internet services can publish from multiple directories. 
Each directory can be located on a local drive or across the network by specifying the directory with a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) name, 
and a user name and password to use for access permission. A virtual 
server can have one home directory and any number of other publishing 
directories. These other publishing directories are referred to as 
virtual directories.
<P>
To simplify client URL addresses, the services present the entire set
of publishing directories to clients as a single directory tree. The 
home directory is the root of this virtual directory tree, and each 
virtual directory is addressed as if it was a subdirectory of the 
home directory. Actual subdirectories of the virtual directories are 
available to clients as well. The WWW service alone supports virtual 
servers; thus, the FTP and gopher services can have only one home
directory. 
<P>
When a virtual directory is defined in Internet Service Manager, an 
alias is associated with the virtual directory. The alias is the 
subdirectory name that will be used by clients to access information 
in the virtual directory. If alias names for virtual directories are 
not specified by the administrator, an alias name is generated 
automatically by Internet Service Manager.
<P>
For example, an administrator may define two virtual directories for 
the WWW service as follows: 
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Wwwroot 

   D:\Webdata      Alias = data

<P><h3>Creating Virtual Directories</h3>
 
<P>
You can create an almost unlimited number of virtual directories for
your service, although performance may suffer if you create too many 
of them.

<OL><P><LI>In Internet Service Manager, double-click the service for which you
   want to add a virtual directory to display its property sheets.

<P><LI>Click the Directories tab.

<P><LI>Click Add.

<P><LI>Click Browse to select a directory in the Directory box.

<P><LI>Click Virtual Directory, then type the name of the virtual directory
   in the Alias box.

<P><LI>Set the Access permissions.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Click Apply and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Virtual directories will not appear in directory listings (also 
called directory browsing for the WWW service). To access a virtual 
directory, users must know the virtual directory's alias, and type 
the URL in the browser. 
<P>
For the WWW service, you can also create links in HTML pages. For the 
gopher service, you can create explicit links in tag files so users 
can access virtual directories. For the FTP service, you can list 
virtual directories by using directory annotations.
<P>
To browse virtual directories, the URL for the virtual directory must 
be specified. You can do this by either clicking a hypertext link 
containing the URL or by typing the URL in the browser.
<P>
Additional information is available in the Internet Information Server 
On-Line documentation and the Microsoft Windows NT Server Resource Kit.
