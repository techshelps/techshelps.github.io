The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install the FTP Server from the Internet Information Server, four
new objects are added to the existing list of objects in Windows NT
Performance Monitor. This article describes an object called Internet
Information Server which contains 10 counters.
<P>
Performance Monitor is a graphical tool for measuring the performance of
your own computer or other computers on a network. On each computer, you
can view the behavior of objects such as processors, memory, cache,
threads, and processes. Each of these objects has an associated set of
counters that provide information on such things as device usage, queue
lengths, and delays, as well as information used for throughput and
internal congestion measurements. It provides charting, alerting, and
reporting capabilities that reflect current activity along with ongoing
logging. You can also open log files at a later time for browsing and
charting as if they were reflecting current activity.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The definitions of the counters under the Performance Monitor object
Internet Information Server are given below:

<P>
Cache Hits is the total number of times a file open, directory listing, or
service specific objects request is found in the cache.
<P>
<P><h3>Cache Hits %</h3>
 
<P>
Cache Hits % is the ratio of cache hits to all cache requests.
<P>
<P><h3>Cache Misses</h3>
 
<P>

<P><h3>Directory Listings</h3>
 
<P>
Directory Listings is the number of cached directory listings cached by all
of the Internet Information Services.

Measured Bandwidth of Async I/O is the number of measured bandwidth of
async I/O averaged over a minute.
<P>
<P><h3>Objects</h3>
 
<P>
Objects is the number of cached objects cached by all of the Internet
Information Services. The objects include file handle tracking objects,
directory listing objects and service specific objects.
<P>
<P><h3>Total Allowed Async I/O Requests</h3>
 
<P>
Total Allowed Async I/O Requests is the number of Total Async I/O Requests
allowed by Bandwidth Throttler.
<P>
<P><h3>Total Blocked Async I/O Requests</h3>
 
<P>
Total Blocked Async I/O Requests is the number of total async I/O requests
blocked by Bandwidth Throttler.
