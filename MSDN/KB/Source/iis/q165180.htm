The information in this article applies to: 

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server version 3.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With Internet Information Server (IIS), you can create virtual servers
that enable a single server to appear as several servers. By 
convention, each domain name (for example, www.company.com) represents 
an individual computer. However, it is possible to use a single 
computer and make it appear to be not only a primary server (for 
example, named www.company.com), but also servers for different 
departments of your company (for example, marketing.company.com, 
sales.company.com, etc.). You can create virtual servers for these 
departments with Microsoft Internet Information Server. You do not 
need a different computer for each domain name.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create virtual servers, you must get Internet Protocol (IP) 
addresses from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) for the primary 
server and for each virtual server you want to create. For example, 
you assign the first IP address (10.212.56.184) in the Domain Name 
System (DNS) as www.company.com (your primary server), and assign 
C:\Wwwroot as its content home directory. You register the second IP 
address (10.212.56.185) in the DNS as marketing.company.com, and 
assign a different drive or directory as its content home directory. 
Therefore, it appears to users on the Internet that there are two 
computers when in fact it is the same computer running one copy of 
the WWW Service.
<P>
NOTE: If you create a home directory without specifying an IP address, 
that home directory will be used for all requests containing server IP 
addresses not specified in other home directories.
<P>
These multiple IP addresses can be assigned to multiple network 
adapter cards or to a single card. You use the Control Panel, Network 
to bind the additional IP addresses to your network adapter card. On 
the Protocol tab, click TCP/IP protocol, and click Properties. Type the 
first IP address, subnet mask, and the computer's default gateway 
under Specify an IP Address on the IP Address tab.
<P>
Then click the Advanced tab to display the Advanced IP Addressing 
dialog box. To add additional IP addresses to your network interface 
card, click the Add button under IP Addresses.
<P>
NOTE: When you assign more than one IP address to a single network
interface card, you must disable automatic DHCP configuration. The DHCP 
server cannot assign multiple IP addresses to the same network interface 
card.
<P>
<P><h3>To set up a virtual server</h3>
 
<P>
You set up a virtual server by using the Directories Property in 
Internet Service Manager.
<PRE>

</PRE><P><LI>To display property sheets in Internet Service Manager, double-click
   the WWW Service or the computer name.

<P><LI>Click the Directories tab.

<P><LI>Click the Add button.

<P><LI>In the Directory box of the Directory Properties dialog box, select
   a directory by clicking the Browse button.

<P><LI>Click Home Directory.

<P><LI>Select the Virtual Server check box.

<P><LI>Type the IP address for the virtual server.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>To specify directories with virtual servers</h3>
 
<P>
If you have assigned more than one IP address to your server, when 
you create a virtual directory, you must specify which IP address has 
access to that directory. If no IP address is specified, that directory 
will be visible to all virtual servers. 
<P>
NOTE: The default directories created during setup do not specify an 
IP address. You may need to specify IP addresses for the default 
directories when you add virtual servers.
