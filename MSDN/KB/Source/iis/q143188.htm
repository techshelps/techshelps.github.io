<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install the Gopher Server from the Internet Information Server,
four new objects are added to the existing list of objects. This article
describes an object called "Gopher server" which contains 19 counters.
<P>
Performance Monitor is a graphical tool for measuring the performance of
your own computer or other computers on a network. On each computer, you
can view the behavior of objects such as processors, memory, cache,
threads, and processes. Each of these objects has an associated set of
counters that provide information on such things as device usage, queue
lengths, and delays, as well as information used for throughput and
internal congestion measurements. It provides charting, alerting, and
reporting capabilities that reflect current activity along with ongoing
logging. You can also open log files at a later time for browsing and
charting as if they were reflecting current activity.
<P>
