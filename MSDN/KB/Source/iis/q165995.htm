<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have set IIS to use the Microsoft Windows NT Challenge/Response 
(NTCR), a valid user may not be able to successfully logon to IIS and 
will be prompted three times for his or her username and password. Then 
the user will get the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Access is denied.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By design, Windows NT Challenge/Response is supposed to pass the user's
credentials to IIS and then be validated by the IIS server. If the user 
has been granted permission, the page will be accessed. If the user has 
NOT been granted permission, IIS will return the above error message. 
<P>
It should NOT return an authentication box. However, this may occur when 
the client is on the same subnet as the IIS server. When IIS challenges 
the client, the client thinks it should have access even if IIS is set 
to NTCR, and it pops up an authentication box. The credentials will show 
the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Resource: 
   Username:
   Password:

</PRE>NOTE: The resource will be blank because NTCR failed. 
<P>
With Basic authentication type enabled, you would see the resource that 
you are trying to access. If you try and put in any credentials that 
are valid, it will fail except for the administrator/administrators of 
that IIS server. 
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To successfully be authenticated all the time, set the authentication 
type to Basic in Internet Service Manager, WWW properties. As a result, 
the client will be able to retrieve the correct resource no matter where 
it resides, and if the user is valid with Logon Locally Rights, he or she
will gain access to the IIS server.
