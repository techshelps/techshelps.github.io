The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft CVPACK for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1, and 4.26
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If an application built for debug mode is linked with the /ONERROR:NOEXE
switch and CVPACK fails for some reason, an executable file is still
generated. This can cause subsequent debugging sessions to fail because the
debugging information is incorrect.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem, do not use the executable file if there has
been a CVPACK error. Instead, find and solve the problem that caused
the CVPACK error to occur and relink the application.
<P>
One exception to this resolution is the case in which a CK4009 error
is generated. In this situation, the packer has reached its limit
for type information and simply truncates any new type information
it subsequently encounters. The .EXE file still contains
valid debugging information, and so it may be successfully debugged;
however, you will not be able to view any symbols whose types were
truncated.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug with the CVPACK utility for
MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.1, and 4.26. We are researching this problem
and will post new information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as soon as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The /ONERROR:NOEXE option was introduced to avoid the danger of system
errors caused by users attempting to load an invalid executable file.
However, in the case of an error occurring during packing, this danger does
not exist because the .EXE file itself is still valid: The .EXE file that
is created overwrites any existing one.
