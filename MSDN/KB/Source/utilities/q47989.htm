The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 2.2, 3.0, 3.11, 3.14, 4.0,
   4.01, 4.05, and 4.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes when I run CodeView, I get an "Internal Debugger Error"
message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Internal Debugger Error messages are usually caused by problems in
your MS-DOS environment; the most likely cause is the presence of
memory-resident software, commonly referred to as TSRs (terminate-
and-stay-resident software).
<P>
For example, running CodeView with Borland's Sidekick loaded has been
known to cause "Internal Debugger Error 80" and "R6002: Floating Point
not loaded" error messages. "Internal Debugger Error 80" has also been
reported when CodeView was run with Software Solutions' "Software
Carousel" loaded into memory.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
CodeView Versions 2.0 and later have become increasingly more
sensitive to TSRs. If you receive an Internal Debugger Error message,
or you are experiencing strange problems within CodeView, make sure
you are running CodeView with no memory-resident software loaded
(including, but not limited to, device drivers, screen savers,
keyboard enhancers, command-line editors, etc.). Disabling your
resident software, but not rebooting, may not completely remove its
interference, so be sure to "boot clean" when trying to resolve a
problem of this type.
<P>
If you continue to receive the error message without memory-resident
programs, try running CodeView on some other program to see if the
error is related to particular code. If the error is related to the
specific code, and you are unable to determine the cause, you may want
to call Microsoft Product Support.
<P>
If the error is not dependent on your code, the problem might be the
particular sequence of CodeView commands you execute. Make a note of
what operations you performed, i.e., the sequence of Trace, Go, Watch,
Breakpoint, etc., commands that were issued, and contact Microsoft
Product Support.
