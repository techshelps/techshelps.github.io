<UL><LI>Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 5.03, 5.05, 5.1, 5.13, 5.3,

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An attempt to link an application fails and Microsoft LINK  generates the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>   L1064: Out of memory

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
According to the "Microsoft FORTRAN, Microsoft CodeView and  Utilities
User's Guide" for version 5.0 the causes of this error  are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   The linker was not able to allocate enough memory from the
   operating system to link the program. On OS/2 try increasing the
   swap space. Otherwise, reduce the size of the program in terms
   of code, data, and symbols. On OS/2, consider splitting the
   program into dynalink libraries.

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The methods to work around this error depend on the operating system in
which LINK is running. In the MS-DOS operating system, the two methods to
address this situation are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>    - Remove any unnecessary memory-resident software or device
      drivers that limit the amount of free memory.

    - Reduce the size of the application as described above.

   If you are using LINK version 5.3 or later in the MS-DOS or
   Microsoft Windows operating systems, the seven methods to address
   this situation are as follows:

    - Delete unnecessary files to free space on your hard disk.

    - Increase the size of the Windows swap file. To create the
      largest possible swap file, use a disk defragmentation utility
      to make the free space contiguous.

    - Reduce the size of the code, data, or symbols.

    - If the program is a segmented-executable file, place some of its
      code into a dynamic-link library (DLL).

    - Remove unnecessary terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) software.

    - Reconfigure the Expanded Memory Manager to provide more
      conventional memory.

    - Edit the CONFIG.SYS file to specify fewer buffers in the BUFFERS
      statement or fewer drives in the LASTDRIVE statement.

   In the OS/2 operating system, the easiest method to work around
   this error is perform the following three steps to increase the
   swap space:

   1. Free up RAM and swap space by closing other screen groups and
      removing other processes from memory.

   2. Load the CONFIG.SYS file into an editor. Find the SWAPPATH
      statement and determine the hard disk on which OS/2 stores the
      swap file. Delete one or more files from this hard disk or
      modify the SWAPPATH statement to point to a drive with more free
      space.

   3. If the error persists, carefully read the explanation of the
      SWAPPATH setting in the text below and possibly decrease the
      swap value specified in the SWAPPATH setting.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The L1064: "Out of memory" error was introduces in LINK version 5.03 which
was first provided with the IMSL libraries for Microsoft FORTRAN version
4.1 and was also provided with FORTRAN version 5.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Explanation of the SWAPPATH Setting in CONFIG.SYS</h3>
 
<P>
The MEMMAN setting in CONFIG.SYS must enable swapping for the SWAPPATH
setting to be acknowledged at all (typically, the command is "MEMMAN=SWAP"
or "MEMMAN=SWAP,MOVE").
<P>
The default SWAPPATH setting when OS/2 is first installed is usually as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   SWAPPATH=C:\OS2\SYSTEM 512

</PRE>The file specification indicates the drive and directory where the swap
file is allocated. If the CONFIG.SYS file does not contain a SWAPPATH
variable, the swapper allocates space in the root directory on the boot
drive. The numeric parameter indicates the amount of free space that must
remain on this drive when the swap file grows to its maximum size. (By
itself, this number does not indicate the maximum size of the swap file.)
Given the SWAPPATH statement above, the maximum size of the swap file is
calculated as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   (free space on drive C) - 512K = (maximum swap file size)

</PRE>Therefore, increasing the value in the SWAPPATH statement DECREASES the
amount of memory available for the swap file.
<P>
You can decrease the value in the SWAPPATH setting and the system allows
values as low as 0 (zero). However, because OS/2 shares processor time
between processes and may need to write to the disk that contains the swap
file, decreasing the SWAPPATH value below 512K (the system default) is not
recommended. Reduce the value only if the SWAPPATH statement specifies a
value greater than 512K (the valid range is 0 to 32,767). If this is the
case, use a text editor to edit CONFIG.SYS and set the SWAPPATH value to
512. Shutdown and reboot the machine.
<P>
If the problem persists, you must delete files from the hard disk that
contains the swap file.
