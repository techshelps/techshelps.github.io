<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When using the Source Browser functionality within the Programmer's
WorkBench (PWB) versions 1.0 and 1.1, you can expect to have
zero-length .SBR files on your disk. This is by design of the PWBRMAKE
utility.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
PWBRMAKE.EXE is a utility that converts the .SBR files created by the
compiler for each program module into a single database file that can
be read by the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) Source Browser. The
resulting Source Browser database file has the extension .BSC.
<P>
When a Source Browser database (a .BSC file) is built from .SBR files,
the .SBR files are truncated to zero length to save disk space since
they can be quite large. .SBR files are truncated to zero length,
rather than being deleted, because PWBRMAKE performs incremental
updates to the database and, therefore, needs the time and date stamp
from the files.
<P>
When you rebuild part of your project, new .SBR files are built for
those modules. Each .SBR file that has not been re-created during a
build is included as a zero-length file. This tells PWBRMAKE that the
file has no new contribution to make to the database, so no update of
that part of the database is required.
