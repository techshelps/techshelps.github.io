The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.01, 4.02, 4.05, and
   4.1
<LI>Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.01, and 4.1
<LI>Microsoft CodeView for Win32s, version 4.25
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When starting CodeView, or when CodeView loads a program to debug, the
following message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Bad DLL Format in 'path\filename'

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Here are four of the most common reasons for this message (resolutions to
each of the causes is shown below):

<OL><P><LI>There are not enough free file handles.

<P><LI>There is not enough available memory.

<P><LI>A dynamic-link library (DLL) from a previous version of CodeView is
   being loaded.

<P><LI>CodeView is trying to load an expression evaluator for a
   different operating system.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around each problem:

<OL><P><LI>Check available file handles, using STRESS.EXE. There should be
   a minimum of six available file handles. If there are too few
   handles, shut down an application and retry, or increase the
   "FILES=" entry in the CONFIG.SYS file.

<P><LI>CodeView can be run with as little as 2 megabytes (MB)of memory,
   although more is recommended. Use STRESS for Windows, MEM for MS-DOS,
   or some other memory utility to find out how much memory is available.
   Shut down other applications and remove any unnecessary terminate-and-
   stay-resident (TSR) programs.

<P><LI>This happens most commonly when upgrading from C/C++ 7.0 to
   Visual C++ 1.0, without removing C/C++ 7.0. The CodeView DLLs
   are still in the path. Unlike CodeView for Windows, CodeView for
   MS-DOS looks for DLLs in the path first. So, for example,
   CodeView 4.1 might find a 4.0 DLL and try to load it, resulting
   in an error. To eliminate this problem, remove the path entry
   pointing to the C700 directory, remove C700, or rename the
   offending DLL to something else.

<P><LI>Attempting to have CodeView for Windows load one of the MS-DOS
   expression evaluators through an Eval statement in the [CVW]
   section of the TOOLS.INI file will also cause the "Bad DLL
   format in 'filename'" error to be displayed. "Filename" is the name
   of the expression evaluator that CodeView for Windows is trying to
   load, and will be either EED1CAN.DLL or EED1CXX.DLL. The message
   is issued immediately after the file to be debugged has been
   specified. This is discussed in more detail in the Knowledge Base (KB)
   article <B><A HREF="../UTILITIES/Q87922.htm">Q87922</A></B>.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
CodeView version 4.0 introduces a new, flexible architecture for the
debugger. CodeView is composed of a main executable program, CV.EXE
(CodeView for MS-DOS) or CVW.EXE (CodeView for Windows) and a
collection of dynamic-link libraries. Each DLL implements an aspect of
the debugging process. For more information on this architecture, see
the CodeView documentation.
