<UL><LI>Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.0x, 5.1x, 5.2,

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft LINK /HIGH option instructs the loader to place to program
into RAM at the highest possible address. However, the Program Segment
Prefix (PSP) is loaded into low memory. When the LINK command line does not
include the /HIGH option, the entire program is loaded into the lowest
possible address in the first available block of RAM.
<P>
The LINK /DS[ALLOCATE] option relocates each address in DGROUP such that
the last byte in the segment has offset FFFFh.
<P>
The /DS and /HIGH options are not recommended for use with applications
developed in a high-level language. These switches are provided for use
with a real-mode assembly-language application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the LINK command line specifies the /HIGH option, the application owns
all memory between its segments (which are loaded at the highest possible
address) and its PSP (which is loaded into low memory). Therefore, the
application cannot dynamically allocate and free memory nor can any other
program be loaded into memory.
<P>
The /HIGH switch provides room for the application stack or heap to grow
downward without colliding with any other program data, if the stack or
heap is the first segment in the memory map.
<P>
The start-up code for the Microsoft high-level language libraries is not
compatible with the /HIGH option. The libraries automatically specify the
/DOSSEG option which loads program segments into low memory. The libraries
also require dynamic memory allocation. Even though it is possible to use
the /HIGH option with custom start-up code, many of the run-time library
functions that require dynamic memory allocation would not be available.
<P>
Early versions of Microsoft FORTRAN and Microsoft Pascal generate code that
must be linked with the /DS option specified. Because the /HIGH option is
often used in conjunction with /DS, Microsoft LINK continues to support
these options.
