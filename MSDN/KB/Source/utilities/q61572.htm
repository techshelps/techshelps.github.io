The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When running the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) for the first time, the
following OS/2 system error may be issued:
<P>
<PRE>   Session Title:
   PWBED.EXE

   SYS2070: The system could not demand load the
   application's segment. MSHELP HELPSHRINK is in error.
   For additional detailed information also see message SYS0127

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is usually caused as a result of the Setup program not
being able to copy its version of MSHELP.DLL over the old version of
MSHELP.DLL. If another process (most likely a detached session of
QH.EXE) was accessing this file during the execution of Setup, the
Setup program will issue a message similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ERROR: Could not create file C:\OS2\DLL\mshelp.dll
   ERROR: File copy failed: A:\the PWB\mshelp.dll to C:\OS2\dll\mshelp.dll

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To solve this problem, take the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Disable QH as a keyboard monitor:
<P>
   a. Press ALT+Q (to invoke QH).
<P>
   b. Press O (for the Options menu).
<P>
   c. Press T (to terminate the monitor).

<P><LI>Copy the up-to-date version of MSHELP.DLL from the distribution
   disk:
<P>
   a. Insert the Setup/Compiler 1 disk into drive A.
<P>
   b. Change the default drive A.
<P>
   c. Run Setup with the /copy option by typing the following:
<P>
<PRE>         setup /copy

   d. Press ENTER

   e. Press ENTER again (unless the setup files are in a drive other
      than A).

   f. At the prompt asking for the name of the file to copy, type
      MSHELP.DLL and press ENTER.

   g. At the prompt asking for the name of the directory to which to
      copy this file, type the directory in which the old MSHELP.DLL
      is located (most likely C:\OS2\DLL).

   h. Setup should then ask for the Programmer's WorkBench/Utilities
      for OS/2 disk to be inserted into the setup drive.

   i. When Setup is finished copying the file, press ENTER at the
      next prompt.

</PRE></OL>The PWB should now start up correctly.
<P>
NOTE: SQL Server's Setup program also installs its own version of
MSHELP.DLL onto the system. The SQL Server Setup places its copy of
this DLL into a directory called \SQL\DLL. If this directory is in the
LIBPATH before the directory into which the latest MSHELP.DLL was
placed, this same problem can arise.
