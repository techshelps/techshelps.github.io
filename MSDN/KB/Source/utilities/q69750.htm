</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Under MS-DOS, the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) will allow the build
target for a project to be a .COM file or a .EXE file. If you are in
the middle of a project and you switch the build options from one of
these file types to the other, the previously built files may cause
unexpected results when you try to run or debug the program.
<P>
This problem is the result of the ordering in which MS-DOS invokes files,
and not a problem with PWB. If a filename is entered at the MS-DOS
command prompt, MS-DOS first looks for a file with a .COM extension. If
no .COM file is found, then DOS searches for a .EXE file. Therefore,
if both a .COM and a .EXE file with the same base name (for example,
PROJ.COM and PROJ.EXE) appear in the same directory, MS-DOS will always
invoke the .COM version (even if the .EXE extension is explicitly
specified).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Within PWB, a request to run your program causes the entire filename
to be passed to MS-DOS for execution, but MS-DOS prevents an .EXE from
overriding a .COM file of the same name. So, if you start a project
with the target as a .COM file and later switch it to an .EXE, then
the existing .COM file always supersedes the new .EXE and is
unexpectedly run whenever you try to execute the program.
<P>
The only way to ensure that you are dealing with the correct .EXE file
is to delete the previous .COM file that you are no longer trying to
build.
<P>
It should also be noted that if you invoke CodeView from inside PWB,
PWB will pass the correct filename (.COM or .EXE) to CodeView, but
outside of PWB, the reverse of the above situation may exist. This
results from the fact that CodeView always assumes that the file you
specify to debug is an .EXE, unless the .COM extension is explicitly
specified on the CodeView command line. Thus, if you switch your
project from an .EXE to a .COM and both files exist in the current
directory, the .EXE will be inadvertently brought up in CodeView when
you invoke the debugger from the MS-DOS prompt if you forget to include
the .COM extension.
