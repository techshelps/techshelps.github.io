<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are several dialog boxes in the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB)
that include a field titled "Additional Libraries" where you may
specify the names of external libraries to be used in a project. When
specifying the names of more than one library in any of these fields,
the library names should be separated only by spaces, not commas or
semicolons. Using any separator other than a space will result in LINK
errors or the generation of an incorrect LINK command line.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When compiling and linking a program within PWB, the following error
may be produced if commas are used to separate libraries in any of the
Additional Libraries fields:
<P>
<PRE>   Link: fatal error L1092: cannot open module-definition file

</PRE>When you use commas to separate library names, PWB does not remove the
commas. Instead, PWB places the entire Additional Libraries string in
the makefile as the LLIB_G, LLIB_D, or LLIB_R macro (depending on
whether you enter the library in the global, debug, or release
Additional Libraries field). Then, PWB generates commands in the
makefile to create a response file where all sequences of spaces in
the macro are replaced with a single space, a plus sign, and a
newline.
<P>
When LINK is invoked with the resulting response file, it assumes that
the first comma between libraries is the normal LINK command-line
separator that delimits the library field from the next field, the
module-definition (.DEF) file field. Thus, LINK tries to read the
following plus sign as if it is the name of a .DEF file, and
therefore, fails with the L1092 error.
<P>
If semicolons are used to separate the library names, the makefile is
again generated as described above, so the semicolons are written to
the response file. As soon as LINK reads the first semicolon, it
assumes the default response for remaining LINK input and does not
read the remaining response file data. This causes particular problems
with LINK options specified in PWB because the PWB generated makefile
places all LINK options on the last line of the response file. Thus,
all LINK options are ignored if a semicolon is encountered first in
the libraries field.
<P>
A different, more obscure problem occurs when the libraries in the
Additional Libraries field are specified with complete names with the
.LIB extension and they are separated only with commas and no
intervening spaces. In this case, LINK fails with the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   LibraryName.lib(1) : syntax error

</PRE>Also, if the incremental linker (ILINK.EXE) is used with these
scenarios, the following ILINK error may be generated:
<P>
<PRE>   ILINK : warning L4266 : invalid .EXE file

</PRE>Note that none of these errors is due to problems in LINK or PWB. To
achieve the intended results, only spaces should be used to separate
libraries in the Additional Libraries field.
