The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0 and 1.1
<LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When attempting to set a Program List using a makefile generated by
the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 1.0 or 1.1, the following
message may be generated if the makefile has been edited by an editor
(other than PWB) that places a CTRL+Z at the end of the file:
<P>
<PRE>   Error reading program list line xxx
       ':' or '=' expected

</PRE>If you select the "OK" button in response to this dialog box, another
dialog box will appear, asking if you want to use the makefile as a
non-PWB makefile.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Some editors other than PWB or the Microsoft Editor (for example, the
OS/2 System Editor) will automatically append a CTRL+Z (end-of-file)
character to every file that is modified. PWB reads this CTRL+Z as a
standard character and expects either a colon (indicating a build
rule) or an equal sign (indicating a macro) to follow it. Finding
neither, PWB will return the error above.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to make modifications to PWB-generated makefiles, while
still allowing PWB to use them as native makefiles, you should add a
"fence" to the end of the makefile. The fence is a separator line of
the following form:
<P>
<PRE>   # &lt;&lt; User_supplied_information &gt;&gt;

</PRE>The comment marker (#) must begin in the first column, and the line
must appear exactly as shown above. Any information placed below this
line is ignored by PWB, but may still be executed by NMAKE. This
method eliminates the possibility of the CTRL+Z problem described
above, as well as ensuring that you retain full functionality of all
PWB menu commands, since PWB never tries to interpret or modify
anything below the fence.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PWB versions 1.0 and
1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here as it becomes available.
