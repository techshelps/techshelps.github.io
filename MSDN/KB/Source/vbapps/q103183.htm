<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
While reports have a RunningSum property, forms do not. This article
describes a method to create a running sum on a form.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access versions 1.x and 2.0. For more information about Access Basic,
please refer to the "Introduction to Programming" manual in Microsoft
Access version 1.x or the "Building Applications" manual in Microsoft
Access version 2.0.
<P>
NOTE: This article explains a technique demonstrated in the sample
files, FrmSampl.exe (for Microsoft Access for Windows 95 version 7.0)
and FrmSmp97.exe (for Microsoft Access 97). For information about how
to obtain these sample files, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : ACC95: Microsoft Access Sample Forms Available on MSL

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q175066.htm">Q175066</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC97: Microsoft Access 97 Sample Forms Available on MSL

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create a running sum on a form, the underlying table or query must have
a unique, sequential ID field, such as AutoNumber (or Counter in versions
1.x and 2.0) or a Date/Time timestamp field. If your table does not have
such a field, you can open the table in Design view and add a new field to
create one.
<P>
NOTE: The following example shows how to generate a running sum on a form
<PRE>using the DSUM function.   For more information on how to generate a
</PRE>running sum on a form, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : ACC: Sample Function to Create a Running Sum on a Form

</PRE>The following example uses the sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB
in versions 1.x and 2.0) to show you how to create a text box on a form
that sums the freight amount for the current customer order and all
preceding customer orders:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open the sample database Northwind.mdb
   (or NWIND.MDB in versions 1.x and 2.0.)

<P><LI>Create the following new form based on the Orders table.
<P>
   NOTE: To improve readability, the underscore (_) is used in the example
   below as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the
   end of the line when you are re-creating this example.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Form:  Form1
      --------------------
      RecordSource: Orders
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Text Box: Order ID
<PRE></PRE>         ControlSource: OrderID
      Text Box: Total
         ControlSource: =DSum("[Freight]","Orders",_
                                "[OrderID] &lt;= Forms![Form1]![OrderID]")

      NOTE: In versions 1.x and 2.0, there is a space in Order ID.

   The DSum() function calculates the sum of all freight charges on orders
   with an Order number less than or equal to the currently displayed order
   number. For this reason, it is important to have a unique and
   sequential ID field.

</PRE><P><LI>View the form in Form view. Note that the Total text box accumulates
   total freight charges for each order as you move from record to record.
