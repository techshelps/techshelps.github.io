<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, unlike in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, there
is no menu command to record a macro that uses relative cell references.
However, you can click Relative Reference on the Stop Recording toolbar.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/</A></B>

</PRE>To record a macro that uses relative cell references, click Relative 
Reference on the Stop Recording toolbar. Clicking Relative Reference a 
second time turns off relative recording.
<P>
NOTE: The ScreenTip for Relative Reference does not change to indicate
whether relative recording is already available. The only indication that
relative recording is started is the appearance of the Relative Reference
button. When the button has a sunken 3-dimensional appearance, relative
recording is started.
<P>
If the Stop Recording toolbar does not appear when you begin recording a
macro, you must display it. To display the Stop Recording toolbar, point to
Toolbars on the View menu, and then click Stop Recording. When you do this,
Microsoft Excel inserts an extra line of code in your macro. Note that when
you run the recorded macro, the Stop Recording toolbar is displayed. To
avoid this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

<P><LI>In Macro Name list, click the name of the macro that you recorded
   and click Edit.
<P>
   This step starts the Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>In the Code window, type an apostrophe (') at the beginning of the
   following line of code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Application.CommandBars("Stop Recording").Visible = True
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the File menu, click "Close and Return to Microsoft Excel."
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you enable relative recording, Microsoft Excel does not retain the
setting for the next session of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h3>Absolute vs. Relative Recording</h3>
 
<P>
By default, recorded macros use absolute cell referencing, which means that
exact cell locations are recorded into the macro. The macro works only with
the exact cells addresses you use when you record the macro.
<P>
When you record a macro with relative cell referencing, the actions
recorded in the macro are relative to the starting cell location.
<P>
The following examples record the same action with absolute, and then
relative cell referencing.
<P>
<P><h3>Recording with Absolute Cell Referencing</h3>
 
<P>
To record a macro with absolute cell referencing, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new workbook in Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Select cell C1 on the worksheet.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Record New Macro.

<P><LI>In the Macro Name box type "Absolute_Recording" (without the quotation
    marks), and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the Stop Recording toolbar, check the appearance of the Relative
    Reference button. If the Relative Reference button has a sunken
    3-dimensional appearance, click it to disable relative recording.

<P><LI>Type "test" (without the quotation marks) and click Enter (green check
    mark).

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Copy.

<P><LI>Select cell C3.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Paste.

<P><LI>On the Stop Recording toolbar, click Stop Recording.

<P><LI>To view the contents of the macro you recorded, point to Macro on the
    Tools menu, and then click Macro. In Macro Name list, click "Absolute
    Recording" and click Edit.
<P>
    This step starts the Visual Basic Editor.
<P>
    The macro is similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>       Sub Absolute_Recording()
       '
       ' Absolute_Recording Macro
       ' Macro recorded 12/27/96 by &lt;your username&gt;
       '
       '
           ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = "test"
           Selection.Copy
           Range("C3").Select
           ActiveSheet.Paste
       End Sub

    This macro enters the word "test" (without the quotation marks), in the
    active cell. Then, the macro copies and pastes the entry you typed in
    cell C3 regardless of the active cell location when you started the
    macro.

</PRE><P><LI>When you are finished viewing the macro, click "Close and Return to
    Microsoft Excel" on the File menu.
<P>
</OL><h3>Recording with Relative Cell Referencing</h3>
 
<P>
To record a macro with relative cell referencing, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new workbook in Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Select cell C1 on the worksheet.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Record New Macro.

<P><LI>In the Macro Name box type "Relative_Recording" (without the quotation
    marks) and click OK.

<P><LI>On the Stop Recording toolbar, check the appearance of the Relative
    Reference button. If the Relative Reference button does not have a
    sunken 3-dimensional appearance, click it to enable relative recording.

<P><LI>Type "test" (without the quotation marks) and click Enter (green check
    mark).

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Copy.

<P><LI>Select cell C3.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Paste.

<P><LI>On the Stop Recording toolbar, click Stop Recording.

<P><LI>To view the contents of the macro you recorded, point to Macro on
    the Tools menu and click Macro. In Macro Name list, click "Relative
    Recording" and click Edit.
<P>
    This step starts the Visual Basic Editor.
<P>
   The macro is similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>        Sub Relative_Recording()
        '
        ' Relative_Recording Macro
        ' Macro recorded 12/27/96 by &lt;your username&gt;
        '
        '
            ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = "test"
            Selection.Copy
            ActiveCell.Offset(2,0).Range("A1").Select
            ActiveSheet.Paste
        End Sub

    This macro enters the word "test" (without the quotation marks) in the
    active cell. Then, the macro copies and pastes the entry you typed to a
    cell location two rows down from the active cell.

</PRE><P><LI>When you are finished viewing the macro, click "Close and Return to
    Microsoft Excel" on the File menu.
