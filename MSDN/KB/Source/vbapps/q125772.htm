The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
As your use of Microsoft Access increases, you may find it necessary or
convenient to run some of your Microsoft Access processes at night or at
other times when you are absent.
<P>
This article describes how to run Microsoft Access processes at specified
times without user intervention.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access versions 1.x and 2.0. For more information about Access Basic,
please refer to the "Introduction to Programming" manual in Microsoft
Access version 1.x or the "Building Applications" manual in Microsoft
Access version 2.0
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Part 1 of this article includes sample code that starts two update
queries. One of the queries is started at 11:00 P.M. and the other is
started at 4:00 A.M. the next morning. In this example, you start the
code by clicking a command button.
<P>
Part 2 contains a sample decision-support flow chart that details some
of the processes and decisions you might use for unattended operations.
You may want to use other graphic aids or decision-support software to
represent your scenario.
<P>
<P><h3>Part 1: Steps to Produce Sample Job Stream</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create two new queries called Query1 and Query2. Base each of these
   queries on a different table (such as the Categories and Products
   tables) in the sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in versions
   1.x and 2.0). Add one or more fields to each query grid.

<P><LI>In each query, click Make Table on the Query menu to convert the
   query to a make table query. Have Query1 make a table called Table1,
   and have Query2 make a table called Table2.

<P><LI>Run both queries. Verify in the Database window that the tables
   Table1 and Table2 have been created.

<P><LI>Create a blank new form with the following controls:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Form: Batch Process Form
      ----------------------------------
      Text box:
<PRE></PRE>         Name: Current Time
         ControlSource: =Now()
      Command button:
         Name: Initiate Batch Processes
         Caption: Run

</PRE><P><LI>Set the command button's OnClick property to the following event
   procedure.
<P>
   NOTE: In Microsoft Access version 1.x the OnClick property is
   called the OnPush property.
<P>
<P><PRE>       Private Sub Initiate_Batch_Processes_Click()
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         MsgBox (Now)
         MsgBox ("Use CTRL+BREAK to terminate manually.")
         On Error Resume Next

         '***************************************************************
         ' "On Error Resume Next" allows processing to continue if, for
         ' example, Table1 does not exist when the code tries to delete
         ' it. The code would then delete the other three tables and
         ' create four new tables. If you want to know when errors such
         ' as this occur, you must add more error-trapping code.
         '***************************************************************

         Do
            DoEvents
         Loop Until Now &gt; CVDate(Date &amp; " 11:00:00 PM")

         '***************************************************************
         ' Change the time to the time you want processing to begin. For
         ' example,

         '    Loop Until Now &gt; "10/4/94 11:55:00 PM"

         '    -or-

         '    Loop Until Now &gt; "10/5/94 12:05:00 AM"

         ' NOTE: Do not use leading zeros in dates. Use

         '    10/4/94 11:55:00 PM

         ' but not

         '    10/04/94 11:55:00 PM

         ' Leading zeros are optional in the time portion of the string.
         ' "AM" and "PM" are not case sensitive.

         ' Double-check the dates you enter, and make sure you have used
         ' "AM" and "PM" correctly. Each entry should have only two spaces
         ' (one between the date and the time, and the other between the
         ' time and "AM" or "PM"). If you get stuck in a loop, use
         ' CTRL+BREAK and then reset your code to start a new test. You
         ' can also use Control Panel's Date/Time icon to reset the
         ' computer's time.

   NOTE: the following code is divided into two sections: one for
   versions 7.0 and 97, and the other for versions 1.x and 2.0.

   In Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97, type:

         Application.SetOption "Confirm Action Queries", 0
         DoCmd.DeleteObject A_TABLE, "Table1"
         DoCmd.OpenQuery "Query1"
         Do
            DoEvents
         Loop Until Now &gt; CVDate(Date &amp; " 4:00:00 AM")
         DoCmd.DeleteObject A_TABLE, "Table2"
         DoCmd.OpenQuery "Query2"
         MsgBox ("Timed processes completed.")
         Application.SetOption "Confirm Action Queries", -1
      End Sub

   In Microsoft Access 1.x and 2.0 type:

         Application.SetOption "Confirm Action Queries", 0
         DoCmd DeleteObject A_TABLE, "Table1"
         DoCmd OpenQuery "Query1"
         Do
            DoEvents
         Loop Until Now &gt; CVDate(Date &amp; " 4:00:00 AM")
         DoCmd DeleteObject A_TABLE, "Table2"
         DoCmd OpenQuery "Query2"
         MsgBox ("Timed processes completed.")
         Application.SetOption "Confirm Action Queries", -1
      End Sub

</PRE></OL><h3>Part 2: Sample Overnight Decision Considerations</h3>
 
<P>
The following considerations are for illustrative purposes only. You
must carefully consider how and when to process your own data. You should
test critical processes against test data before implementing unattended
processing. Note that contingency procedures are especially important if
follow-on processing must proceed early in the day.
<P>
You may want to use transaction processing to handle sets of processes
that must succeed as a group or be rolled back to a starting point.
<P>
You may want to use Microsoft Project or other decision-support software
to graphically represent your critical path to help you understand how
to proceed in partial failure situations.
<P>
Sample Overnight Decision Flowchart:
<P>
<PRE>   Do critical daily activity processes needed by tomorrow or ASAP
   (backups, accounts receivable, patient status, and so on).

   If critical processes fail? THEN
      Call or page primary responsible person or
         secondary responsible person or management.
      If some or all critical processes continue to fail
         or help is slow in arriving? THEN
            Run processes not dependent on previous failures.
      Else
         Continue to analyze the problem and wait for help.
   Else
         Do any remaining daily activity updates.
         Do nightly backups after updating. (It is your business
            decision whether to back up your data before or after nightly
            processing, or both before and after.)
         Do reporting.
         Do user-specific batch SQL requests.
         Upon returning, check status of processes.
