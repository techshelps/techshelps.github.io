The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Programming System, Applications Edition,
   version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information discusses differences between Microsoft Visual
Basic Programming System, Applications Edition and Microsoft Visual Basic
3.0, Standard and Professional Editions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In general, the Applications Edition of the Visual Basic Programming System
helps you customize the applications that support it: Microsoft Excel and
Microsoft Project. In contrast, Visual Basic 3.0 allows you to create
independent applications.
<P>
Because the Applications Edition of Visual Basic must operate within an
application that supports it, there are some differences in what you can
and cannot control.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Differences Between VB 3.0 Standard &amp; Professional Editions

</PRE><h3>Dialog Box Controls</h3>
 
<P>
The Applications Edition in Microsoft Excel has a limited set of object
properties for dialog box controls. You cannot format or align text, and
the events that you can use for dialog box controls are limited to OnClick,
OnChange, and OnShow. Visual Basic 3.0 events such as Focus, Keydown, and
Mousedown are not available.
<P>
<P><h3>Database Connectivity</h3>
 
<P>
Using Visual Basic, Applications Edition in Microsoft Excel, limited
database connectivity is supported through Microsoft Query. A feature in
both the Standard and Professional Editions of Visual Basic is the
Microsoft Access 1.1 Database Engine. The database engine provides direct
access to Microsoft Access, Microsoft FoxPro, Borland dBASE, Borland
Paradox, and Novell Btrieve. The Professional Edition offers full Open
Database Connectivity (ODBC) support.
<P>
<P><h3>Using .VBX Files</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot use custom controls (.VBX files) with Visual Basic, Applications
Edition. While .VBX files enhance the functionality of Visual Basic version
3.0, objects in Visual Basic, Applications Edition offer similar
enhancements.
<P>
Visual Basic 3.0, Professional Edition provides .VBX files for such things
as grids and charts, while in Microsoft Excel, you have objects such as
worksheets and charts that provide this functionality. Using Visual Basic,
Applications Edition with Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Project objects
offers certain advantages. For example, these objects have greater
functionality and there are many objects for which there are no comparable
.VBX files, such as Pivot Tables.
