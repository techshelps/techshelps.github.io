<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a macro that activates and deactivates a chart, the chart
remains selected.
<P>
If your macro expects that the selection before the chart activation will
remain selected when the chart is deactivated, your macro may fail or may
not perform as it did in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, programmatically activating an
embedded chart does not select the chart. The selection remains on the
range or object on the worksheet that was selected before the chart was
activated.
<P>
This behavior has changed in Microsoft Excel 97. In Microsoft Excel 97,
programmatically activating a chart will select the chart area. Thus, when
the chart is deactivated, it remains selected.
<P>
This change in functionality may cause problems with code that expects the
selection to remain as it was before the chart activation.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To programmatically deactivate and deselect an embedded chart, you must
select another object on the worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design in Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows.
<P>

<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, you could use the following line in
a macro to restore the selection before the chart is activated:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveWindow.Visible = False

</PRE>In Microsoft Excel 97, you can use the following macro example to restore
the worksheet selection after the chart is deactivated. This macro
demonstrates how you can store the selection before activating an embedded
chart and how to restore that selection and deactivate the chart.
<P>
<PRE>Sub ChartSelection()

    Dim myobj As Object

    'Save the current selection in the object variable "myobj".
    Set myobj = Selection

    'Activate the embedded chart.
    ActiveSheet.ChartObjects(1).Activate

    'Restore the selection.
    myobj.Select

End Sub
