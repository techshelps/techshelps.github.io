<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When your Visual Basic for Applications macro returns the number of
characters within a range of a table cell, if that range includes the
entire cell, the number of characters returned is one more than expected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By design, the End of Cell Mark (ASCII character number 7) is returned as
part of the text when the cell range is set to include the entire cell.
Using the Range.Text property includes the paragraph mark and the end of
cell mark (ASCII 13 and ASCII 7) and returns them as a pair.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P>
To return the number of characters within a range of a table cell,
excluding the end of cell mark, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: Each method includes an example of a Visual Basic for Applications
   macro that:

   1. Sets a range object to an existing table.

   2. Collapses the range to the start of the range (the first cell in the
      table).

   3. Expands the range to equal the first cell of the table and returns
      the number of characters within the range.

</PRE><h3>method 1: Subtract 1 from the Return Value</h3>
 
<P>
You can simply subtract 1 from the returned value to exclude the end of
cell mark from your character count. This method still includes any
paragraph marks within the range of text:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub RangeExpandCell()
      Dim oTableR As Object
      Set oTableR = ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Range
      oTableR.Collapse wdCollapseStart
      MsgBox Len(ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Cell(1, 1).Range.Text)-1
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>method 2: Use the Expand Method</h3>
 
<P>
The Expand method excludes the end of cell mark but includes any paragraph
marks within the range of text.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub RangeExpandCell()
      Dim oTableR As Object
      Set oTableR = ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Range
      oTableR.Collapse wdCollapseStart
      MsgBox oTableR.Expand(wdCell)
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about the Expand method, from the Visual Basic for
Applications editor, click the Office Assistant, type "Expand Method,"
click Search, and then click to view "Expand Method."
