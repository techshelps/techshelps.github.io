The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article, 
if you have an Auto_Open macro that is designed to hide all of the toolbars
when a workbook is opened, it does not successfully hide those toolbars
that are floating (or not docked).
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for Windows and Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, this
problem may occur if you open the workbook by double-clicking an icon in
Program Manager. In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, this problem may
occur if you open the workbook by double-clicking it in the Finder. In
Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, this problem may occur if you open the
workbook by double-clicking a shortcut.
<P>

</PRE>To work around this problem, follow these steps:

<UL><LI>Use a different method to open the workbook. This problem does not occur
   if you open the workbook by double-clicking it in File Manager (or in
   Windows Explorer) in Windows or if you use the Open command on the File
   menu in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Use an Auto_Open macro that waits a few seconds before running the macro
   to hide all of the toolbars. For example, you could use the following
   macro:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Auto_Open()
         ' Run the macro HideToolbars 3 seconds from now.
         Application.OnTime Now + TimeValue("00:00:03"), "HideToolbars"
      End Sub

      Sub HideToolbars()
         Dim Tbar as Object
         ' Hide all of the toolbars in Microsoft Excel
         For Each Tbar in Toolbars
            Tbar.Visible = false
         Next
      End Sub

</PRE></UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in 
Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows and Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
