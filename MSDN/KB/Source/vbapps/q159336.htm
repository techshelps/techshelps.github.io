The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you display a UserForm in Microsoft Excel 97, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to the 
following:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module FM20.DLL at
   0137:60007585.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You create a control on the UserForm and attach code to the Enter event.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The code that is attached to the Enter event for the control uses
   the Unload statement.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The control has a TabIndex property of 0 (zero).
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you must use the Unload statement in the code that is attached to the
Enter event for a control, set the TabIndex property to a value other than
zero.
<P>
To change the TabIndex property for a control, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Select the control on the UserForm.

<P><LI>If the Properties window is not visible, click Properties Window on
   the View menu.

<P><LI>In the Properties window, scroll until you see the TabIndex property and
   type a number other than zero for the property.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This method renumbers the TabIndex property for all the controls on
the UserForm. Check this property for all the other controls to see whether
they are still in the correct order.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
Because the Enter event occurs before the focus moves to a particular
control, you can use an Enter event procedure to display instructions; for
example, you can use a macro or event procedure to display a small form or
message box that identifies the type of data the control contains.
<P>
The Exit event is similar to the Enter event. However, the order in which
these two events are triggered differs. For example, if you select a check
box that initiates the Enter event, and you then select another control in
the same form, the Exit event is initiated for the check box, and the Enter
event occurs for the second control on the form.
<P>
To prevent a control from losing focus, set the Cancel argument of the Exit
event to a value of True. For example, if you create a command button
called CommandButton1 on your UserForm, you can use the following code for
the Exit event:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub CommandButton1_Exit (ByVal Cancel As MSForms.ReturnBoolean)
       Cancel = True
   End Sub

</PRE></OL>Therefore, if CommandButton1 receives the focus, it does not lose focus
when you attach the code to the Exit event for the control.
