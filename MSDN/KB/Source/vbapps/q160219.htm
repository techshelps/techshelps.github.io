The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the SendKeys method to send keystrokes to the active
application, and you specify True for the Wait argument so that the
keystrokes are processed before control is returned to the macro, the macro
continues without waiting for the keystrokes to be processed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you use the Sendkeys method for the Microsoft
Excel Application object instead of the Visual Basic for Applications
Sendkeys statement.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
When you set the Wait argument to True using either of these functions, you
expect Microsoft Excel to wait for the keys to be processed before
returning control to the macro.
<P>
When the following Visual Basic for Applications SendKeys statement is
executed, the {Enter} keystroke command is processed before the next line
in the macro is executed:
<P>
<PRE>   SendKeys String:="{Enter}", Wait:=True

</PRE>However, when the Sendkeys method of the Application object is executed,
the {Enter} keystroke command is NOT processed before the next line in the
macro is executed:
<P>
<PRE>   Application.SendKeys Keys:="{Enter}", Wait:=True

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you require that the keystrokes be processed before control is returned
to your macro, use the Visual Basic for Application SendKeys statement.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
