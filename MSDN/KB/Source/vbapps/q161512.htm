</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the GetSaveAsFilename or GetOpenFilename methods in a Visual
Basic for Applications macro, Microsoft Excel may add a period (.) to the
end of the string that is returned. When the period is appended, unexpected
results may occur when you use the string as the file name argument for the
SaveAs or Open methods.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you do not add a file name extension to the file
name that you type into the dialog box provided by GetSaveAsFilename or
GetOpenFilename. For example, if you type "Test" (without the quotation
marks), GetSaveAsFilename returns "Test." (without the quotation marks). If
the macro passes this string to the SaveAs method, the macro does not add a
file name extension to the file name when the file is saved. If you type a
file name with a file name extension, such as "Test.xls" (without the
quotation marks), a period is not added to the end of the string
that is returned.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the GetSaveAsFilename or GetOpenFilename method, determine
whether there is a period at the end of the string that is returned and
remove it if it is present. If the rightmost character is a period, strip
it from the string before you pass it to the SaveAs method.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in

may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating

<P>
The following sample macro code checks for a trailing period (.) in the
string that is returned by the GetSaveAsFilename method. To use the macro,
use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Close and save any open workbooks, and then create a new workbook.

<P><LI>Start the Visual Basic Editor (press ALT+F11).

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Module.

<P><LI>Type the following code in the module:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Test()

          Dim FileIn as String
          Dim Fname as String

          'Display the Dialog box.
          FileIn = Application.GetSaveAsFilename

          'Check for a trailing period.
          If Right(FileIn, 1) = "." Then

              'Remove the period from the string.
              Fname = Left(FileIn, Len(FileIn) - 1)

          Else
              Fname = FileIn
          End If

          'Pass the string Fname to the SaveAs method.
          ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs FileName:=Fname

      End Sub

</PRE></OL>When you run the macro, it strips the trailing period before the results of
GetSaveAsFilename are passed to the SaveAs method.
