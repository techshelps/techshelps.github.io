<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when you click a Cancel button in a custom UserForm,
the UserForm may not be dismissed as you expect.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because setting the Cancel property of a button to 
True does not actually cause the UserForm to be dismissed when you click 
the button.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without 
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the 
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular 
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming 
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug 
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality 
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to 
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific 
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact 
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more 
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see 
the following page on the World Wide Web:

<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>In addition to setting the Cancel property of the button to True, you must
also include the following line of code in the subroutine assigned to the
Click event of the button:
<P>
<PRE>   Unload Me

</PRE>For example, if your Cancel button is named "CancelButton", assign the
following to the Click event for the button:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub CancelButton_Click()

       'You can include any additional code here. The next line of code
       'is the important line.

       Unload Me        'Unloads the UserForm.

   End Sub

</PRE>To view or edit subroutines attached to a specific button, double-click the
button while editing the UserForm in the Visual Basic Editor.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you design custom UserForms in Microsoft Excel 97, you can set one
command button in the UserForm as a Cancel button. When the UserForm is
active, pressing the Escape key activates the Cancel button, just as if it
were clicked.
<P>
However, if you click the Cancel button (or press the Escape key), the
UserForm may not be dismissed. To make sure that the UserForm is dismissed,
you must also add the code "Unload Me" (without quotation marks) to the
Click event subroutine assigned to the button.
