<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can use Microsoft Excel to continuously import data to a worksheet in
real time by using third-party products or custom applications. For
example, you can use DDE to import live data from a stock market wire
service, or you can import data directly into Microsoft Excel from a remote
sensor or device.
<P>
In these situations, there may be times that an audible alert is desired to
notify you that a critical value has been reached or exceeded, thefore
eliminating the need for you to continuously monitor Microsoft Excel.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, a Visual Basic for Applications macro can be used
to continuously monitor real-time or changing values in a worksheet,
compare them against a specific criteria, and then sound an audible warning
when that criteria has been met.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
In order to play a sound in a Visual Basic for Applications procedure, a
Windows API function, sndPlaySound(), can be used to play a .wav file.
<P>
This macro assumes that a sound card capable of playing .wav files is
installed. For information about how to programmatically determine if a
sound card is currently installed, see the following Knowledge Base
article:
