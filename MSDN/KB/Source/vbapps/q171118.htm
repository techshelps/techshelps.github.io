<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes troubleshooting tips that you can use when an
Outlook programming solution works on your development computer, but does
not work properly on another person's computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

</PRE>Use the following troubleshooting tips to solve problems with your
programming solution.
<P>
<P><h3>VBScript Version</h3>
 
<P>
If your solution involves forms that use Visual Basic Scripting Edition
(VBScript), make sure all computers are using the same version of VBScript.
If you used a newer version of VBScript on your computer to develop the
solution, you may need to install the same version of VBScript on all user
computers.
<P>
For more information about VBScript versions, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A HREF="../vbapps/Q167138.htm">Q167138</A></B>
   Title     : OL97: General Information About Using VBScript with Outlook

</PRE><h3>Controls</h3>
 
<P>
If your solution uses any controls, check to see if the controls are
properly installed on all user computers. Are they the same version?
Ideally, you should require your users to run a setup program (see the
Setup Wizard in the Visual Basic or the Office 97 Developer's Edition) to
make sure all of your controls are installed correctly.
<P>
NOTE: Like Word and Excel, Outlook forms are continually in design-time
mode, as opposed to compiled Visual Basic or Microsoft Access applications,
which are in run-time mode. In Outlook versions prior to Outlook 97,
version 8.03, controls must have a design-time license for use on a second
computer. Often, a design-time license is only available if you install a
development product, such as Visual Basic or the Office 97 Developer's
Edition.
<P>
<P><h3>Permissions or User Rights</h3>
 
<P>
Do the other users have proper permissions, or rights, to use any public
folders or other resources that your solution uses?
<P>
<P><h3>Save Form Definition</h3>
 
<P>
If your solution sends forms from one user's computer to another, did you
enable the "Save form definition with item" option on the form's Property
tab when in design mode? If not, you or the users must properly install the
form (based on the solution) on their computers; otherwise, the form is not
available for their use.
<P>
<P><h3>Read Layout</h3>
 
<P>
Some forms have separate Compose and Read pages. If you want the form to
have one view when it is created or read, turn off the Separate Read Layout
setting on the Layout menu when the form is in design mode. Depending on
the type of form, this setting may be on or off by default.
