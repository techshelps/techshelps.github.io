The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you run the Setup program for Microsoft Access 97 on a computer that
also has Microsoft Access 2.0 or 7.0 and Microsoft Graph 5.0 installed,
and you include the Microsoft Graph 8.0 components in the Setup options,
any existing Microsoft Graph 5.0 objects that you edit are upgraded to the
newer version of the Microsoft Graph object. Once a graph object is
upgraded to the newer version, you can no longer open the graph on a
computer that has only Graph 5.0 installed.
<P>
This article describes how to change a graph object back to its original
format so that you can opened it in Microsoft Access 2.0. You must have a
copy of both Microsoft Access 2.0 (which contains the Graph 5.0 component)
and Microsoft Access 97 (which contains the Graph 8.0 component) available
on the computer that you are using to convert the graph files before the
update will work.
<P>
NOTE: Using the SaveAsOldFileFormat method doesn't change the file format
of the graph. It just makes it readable by Graph 5 so that you do not get a
Registry error. You will not be able to make changes to the graph and you
cannot use the graph in a report that changes the graph for each record.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: This article assumes that the graphs you change back will be used
on a computer that has Microsoft Access 2.0 only. If you are planning to
use the graph objects on a computer that has both Microsoft Access 97 and
Microsoft Access 2.0, changing the graph objects back will do no good
because once the graph is reopen on that computer, it will be converted
to Graph 8.0.
<P>
To change your updated graph back to its original format, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the form that contains a graph that you want to change back to its
   original state in Design view in Microsoft Access 2.0.

<P><LI>Set the Enabled property of the Graph to Yes.

<P><LI>Set the Locked Property of the Graph to No.

<P><LI>Add a command button to the form and type the following in the
   OnClick property of the command button:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Me![&lt;graph name].object.application.saveasoldfileformat 5,0
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The SaveAsOldFileFormat method to save a graph to an earlier
   version can only be used on graphs that have been converted from
   Microsoft Access 2.0 to Microsoft Access 97.

<P><LI>Save the form. View the form in Form view, and then click the command
   button.

<P><LI>Save the form again. The graph is now enabled for Graph 5.0.

<P><LI>Close the form, and then close the database.

<P><LI>Open the database on a computer that has Microsoft Access 2.0.
   Note that the graph is changed back to the earlier version.
