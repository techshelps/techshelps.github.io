The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro
that formats a chart, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':
   Unable to set the AxisGroup property of the Series class

</PRE>Note that the same macro works correctly in earlier versions of Microsoft
Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are using a line of code similar to the following to move a series
   from the primary y axis to the secondary y axis:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(3).AxisGroup = 2
</PRE><P>
   -and-

<LI>Only one series in the chart is assigned to the primary y axis. For
   example, if a chart has three series, one of the series is assigned to
   the primary y axis. The other two series are assigned to the secondary y
   axis.
<P>
</UL>Note that it does not matter that the series you are moving is already
assigned to the secondary y axis.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, modify the Visual Basic code so
that it resembles the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ' Disable macro error messages.
   On Error Resume Next

   ' Move the 3rd series to the secondary y axis.
   ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(3).AxisGroup = 2

   ' Resume normal error handling.
   On Error GoTo 0

</PRE>NOTE: The "On Error" lines prevent the error from occurring.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, it is possible for all of the
series in a chart to be assigned to the secondary y axis. In Microsoft
Excel 97, this is not possible. If you attempt to move the last series that
uses the primary y axis to the secondary y axis, you receive an error
message and the macro halts.
<P>
Because of a problem in the code that determines whether a series may be
moved to the secondary y axis, you receive an error message even if the
series in question is already assigned to the secondary y axis.
