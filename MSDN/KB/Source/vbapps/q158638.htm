The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro in Microsoft Excel 97,
you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to the 
following:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   014f:3026787c.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You use the ApplyNames method to apply names to a range of cells that
   contains formulas.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>None of the names you apply exists in the active workbook.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>

provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in

may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, do not apply names that do not
exist in the active workbook. One method for doing this in a Visual Basic
macro is to loop through the array of defined names before you use the
ApplyNames method. Then, verify that at least one of the names exists. To
do this, create the following macro:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub CheckArrayofNames()

       'Set the range to which you want to apply names.
       Set Range1 = Range("B1:B5")

       'Assume that none of the names exist.
       OneNameExists = False

       'Set the array of names you want to apply.
       MyArray = Array("Alpha", "Bravo", "Charlie")

       'Prevent the macro from stopping if a name doesn't exist.
       On Error Resume Next

       'For each name we want to apply...
       For Each xItem In MyArray

           'For each defined name in the workbook...
           For Each yName In ActiveWorkbook.Names

               'If a match exists, then...
               If xItem = yName.Name Then

                   'A name that you are applying exists, so exit
                   'the loop.
                   OneNameExists = True
                   Exit For
               End If
           Next yName
           If OneNameExists = True Then Exit For
       Next xItem

       'Re-enable normal error handling.
       On Error GoTo 0

       'If one of the names you are applying exists, then...
       If OneNameExists = True Then

           '...apply names now.
           Range1.ApplyNames MyArray
       End If

   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In a Visual Basic for Applications macro, you can use the ApplyNames method
to apply names to a range of cells that contain formulas. For example, if
the defined name "Alpha" (without the quotation marks) refers to cell A1 in
a worksheet, and cell B5 contains the formula "=$A$1" (without the
quotation marks), you can use the ApplyNames method to automatically change
the formula to "=Alpha" (without the quotation marks). For example, use the
following sample line of code:
<P>
<PRE>   Range("B5").ApplyNames "Alpha"

</PRE>Any reference to cell A1 is replaced by a reference to the defined name
"Alpha".
<P>
You can apply more than one name at a time by creating an array of defined
names. For example, use the following sample line of code to create an
array:
<P>
<PRE>   Range("B5").ApplyNames Array("Alpha", "Bravo", "Charlie")

</PRE>If you create an array, and none of the names specified in the array exist
in the active workbook, you will receive an invalid page fault and
Microsoft Excel will stop responding. To prevent this behavior from
occurring, verify that at least one of the names specified in the array
actually exists in the active workbook.
