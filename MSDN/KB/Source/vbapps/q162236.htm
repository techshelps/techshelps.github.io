<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following macro code enables you to have a three-dimensional (3-D)
shape rotate along the X and Y axes during a slide show. This animation is
launched by creating an action button linked to the macro Rotate3d_Object.

</PRE>This macro assumes that you have linked the macro code to an action
setting, either to an action button or an object on the slide itself.
To start the macro, click on the linked button or object.
<P>
For more information about linking macros to action controls, search the
Help Index for "Set up a macro to run during a slide show", or ask the
Microsoft PowerPoint Office Assistant.

<PRE>   Sub Rotate3d_Object()

      ' Change this constant for different degrees or rotation.
      Const Increment As Integer = 5

      ' Use to control the for loop.
      Dim i As Integer
      Dim j As Integer

      ' A handle used to control the shape.
      Dim FirstShape As Shape

      ' A handle to reference the slide show window.
      Dim show as SlideShowWindow

      ' Two methods to set the active SlideShowWindow to the variable show:
      ' Set show = ActivePresentation.SlideShowSettings.Run
      ' -or-
      Set show = ActivePresentation.SlideShowWindow

      ' The first method allows you either to start the macro, which then
      ' automatically runs the slide show and the animations, or to link
      ' the macro to an object on the slide via an action setting. The
      ' animations would then run by clicking the object during a slide
      ' show. The second method is strictly an action setting, and
      ' functions only during a slide show.

      ' Get a reference to the shape. This assumes that the 3-D shape is in
      ' index position 2 on slide 1 of the presentation. That is, it is
      ' the second shape on the slide.
      Set FirstShape = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(2)

      ' The RotationY and RotationX commands can rotate an object only
      ' from -90 degrees to 90 degrees. Also, it rotates to a specific
      ' point on a compass: if you rotate along the y axis to 45 degrees,
      ' the shape is now 45 degrees from dead center.
      For i = -45 To 45 Step Increment

         ' Rotate the shape to the degree specified.
         FirstShape.ThreeD.RotationY = i
         FirstShape.ThreeD.RotationX = i

         ' Refresh the slide. This step is needed to redraw the screen
         ' after the rotation step; Otherwise, the animation effect is
         ' invisible.
         show.View.GotoSlide 1

      Next i

      For i = 45 To -45 Step -Increment

         FirstShape.ThreeD.RotationY = i
         FirstShape.ThreeD.RotationX = i

         ' Refresh the slide.
         show.View.GotoSlide 1
      Next i

   End Sub
