<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 97 and 7.0, you can use the Visual Basic
for Applications Cursor property to control the appearance of the
mouse pointer while a macro is running. In earlier versions of Microsoft
Excel, you do not have this ability to change the way the mouse pointer
is displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, the mouse pointer is normally displayed as
an hourglass when you run a macro. The exception to this is when you run a
macro from a control in a custom dialog box. In this case, the mouse
pointer continues to be displayed as an arrow, and does not give you an
indication that the macro (event procedure) is running.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 7.0 and 97, you can use the Cursor property to
display the mouse pointer as an arrow, an hourglass, an I-beam (displayed
when editing text), and the default pointer. The following built-in
constants correspond to each of the available cursor shapes:
<P>
<PRE>   xlNorthwestArrow    The northwest-arrow pointer
   xlWait              The hourglass pointer
   xlIBeam             The I-beam pointer
   xlNormal            The default pointer

</PRE>Note that when you type in the constant for the I-beam pointer, the letter
that follows the "xl" prefix is an "I" (for I-beam).

<P><h3>Cursor Property Example</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>Sub ChangePointer()

    ' Display dialog box indicating mouse pointer will change
    MsgBox "Click OK to display mouse pointer as hourglass."

    ' Display mouse pointer as hourglass
    Application.Cursor = xlWait

    ' Loop so mouse pointer change will be noticeable
    For x = 1 To 1000
        For y = 1 To 1000
        Next y
    Next x

    MsgBox "Click OK to display mouse pointer as arrow."

    ' Display mouse pointer as arrow
    Application.Cursor = xlNorthwestArrow

    ' Loop so mouse pointer change will be noticeable
    For x = 1 To 1000
        For y = 1 To 1000
        Next y
    Next x

    MsgBox "Click OK to display mouse pointer as I-beam."

    ' Display mouse pointer as I-beam
    Application.Cursor = xlIBeam

    ' Loop so mouse pointer change will be noticeable
    For x = 1 To 1000
        For y = 1 To 1000
        Next y
    Next x

    MsgBox "Click OK to return mouse pointer to normal."

    ' Return mouse pointer to normal display
    Application.Cursor = xlNormal

End Sub

</PRE>Note that because the Cursor property isn't automatically reset when the
macro stops running, you should reset the mouse pointer by setting the
Cursor property to the xlNormal value before your macro stops.
