<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to record a macro using the Previous Row or Next Row
buttons (in the Table Cell Height And Width dialog box), you do not receive
the results you expect when you play back the macro.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when either of the following conditions is true when
you record the macro:

<UL><LI>The macro was recorded using the Previous Row command and the insertion
   point was in the first row of the table.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The macro was recorded using the Next Row command and the insertion
   point was in the last row of the table.
<P>
</UL>When you run the recorded macro it does not wrap to the beginning or end of
the table as it does when you perform these actions manually.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>

</PRE>To work around this problem, edit the recorded macro.
<P>
In Visual Basic for Applications, there are several methods which can be
used to move the insertion point. Shown below are suggested methods that
can be used to effectively wrap the insertion point to the first or last
row of the current table in a document.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Previous Row command</h3>
 
<P>
Look for the following command line if you recorded a macro that uses the
Previous Row command
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.Move Unit:=wdRow, Count:=-1

</PRE>and change the command line to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ' Make sure the insertion point is within a table.
   If Selection.Information(wdWithInTable) Then
      ' If at top of table,
      If Selection.Rows(1).Index = 1 Then
         ' Wrap to bottom of table.
         Selection.Move Unit:=wdRow, Count:=Selection.Tables(1).Rows.Count
      Else
         ' Otherwise, move up one row.
         Selection.Move Unit:=wdRow, Count:=-1
      End If
   End If

</PRE><h3>Using the Next Row command</h3>
 
<P>
Look for the following command line if you recorded a macro that uses the
Next Row command
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.Move Unit:=wdRow, Count:=1

</PRE>and change the command line to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ' Make sure the insertion point is within a table.
   If Selection.Information(wdWithInTable) Then
      ' If at bottom of table,
      If Selection.Rows(1).Index = Selection.Tables(1).Rows.Count Then
         ' Wrap to top of table.
         Selection.StartOf wdTable, wdMove
      Else
         ' Otherwise, move down one row.
         Selection.Move Unit:=wdRow, Count:=1
      End If
   End If

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
