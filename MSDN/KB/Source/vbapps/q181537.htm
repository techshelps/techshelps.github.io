<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have an AutoExec macro designed to work with an add-in program, Word
will return an error that is based on the task the AutoExec macro is
attempting to complete. For example, attempting to call a macro stored in
an add-in template results in the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '4633': Unable to run the specified macro.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By design, Visual Basic for Applications is asynchronous in operation. This
means that while one command is processing, dependent upon the command
called, your code will begin processing the next command.
<P>
For example, if your code processes a command to print a document, and the
next command displays a message box, the message box appears before the
document completes printing. In Word, an AutoExec macro is run before any
add-ins are loaded; therefore, the call to the macro stored in your add-in
fails and an error occurs.
<P>

</PRE>The following sample macro commands provide a means for working around this
limitation by using the OnTime method to delay processing of a macro stored
in a template add-in.
<P>
The When argument of the OnTime method specifies the time at which a macro
is to be run. It can be a string that specifies a time (for example, "4:30
pm" or "16:30"), or it can be a serial number returned by a function, such
as TimeValue or TimeSerial (for example, TimeValue("2:30 pm") or
TimeSerial(14, 30, 00)). You can also include the date (for example, "6/30
4:15 pm" or TimeValue("6/30 4:15 pm")).
<P>
Use the sum of the return values of the Now function and either the
TimeValue or TimeSerial function to set a timer to run a macro a specified
amount of time after the statement executes. For example, use
Now+TimeValue("00:05:30") to run a macro 5 minutes and 30 seconds after the
statement executes.
<P>
The Tolerance argument of the OnTime method specifies the maximum time (in
seconds) that can elapse before a macro that wasn't run at the time
specified by When is canceled. Macros may not always run at the specified
time. For example, if a sort operation is under way or a dialog box is
being displayed, the macro will be delayed until Word has completed the
task. If this argument is 0 (zero) or omitted, the macro is run regardless
of how much time has elapsed since the time specified by When.
<P>
NOTE: The time to wait will vary between faster and slower computers and
may need to be adjusted appropriately.
<P>
<PRE>   Application.OnTime When:=Now() + TimeValue("00:00:3"), _
      Name:="MyProject.MyModule.MyMacro", Tolerance:=2
