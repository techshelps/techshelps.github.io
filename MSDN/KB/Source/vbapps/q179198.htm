<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
At times, you may want to reset or change a user's password without
using the user interface. This article demonstrates several sample
functions that you can use to accomplish this task.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without

language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE><h3>Resetting or Changing a User's Password When Password Has Been Forgotten</h3>
 
<P>
The following sample function allows a user to reset or change the password
of another user if the password has been forgotten.
<P>
Because it is not advisable to allow all users to reset or change the
passwords of others, the function requires that the username and password
of a user with administrative rights (a member of the "admins" group, for
example) be passed for the function to complete its work.
<P>
To create this example, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open your database in Microsoft Access 7.0 or 97.

<P><LI>In the Database window, click the Modules tab, and then click New.

<P><LI>Type or paste the following code in the module that you have just
   created:
<P>
<P><PRE>    Public Sub ChangeResetPassword(StrAction As String, StrUsername As _
    String, StrAdminLogon As String, StrAdminPass As String, Optional _
    StrNewPassword As Variant)
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    Dim ws As Workspace
    On Error GoTo ChangeResetPassword:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    ' Create a new Administrative Workspace. If The StrAction passed to the
    ' function is "Change" then change the Password of the User named in
    ' StrUsername to the password saved in StrNewPassword.
    ' If the StrAction passed is "Reset", Then reset the password of
    ' the User mentioned in StrUsername. If neither "Change" or "Reset"
    ' is passed to the function in the StrAction argument, inform the
    ' user of an error and exit the procedure.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    Set ws = DBEngine.CreateWorkspace("AdminWorkspace",StrAdminLogon, _
    StrAdminPass)
    If StrAction = "change" Then
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         If Not IsNull(StrNewPassword) Then
            ws.Users(StrUsername).NewPassword "", StrNewPassword
            MsgBox "Password Change Successful", vbOKOnly
         Else
             MsgBox "When Attempting to Change A User's Password, You " &amp; _
               "Must Include a New Password", vbOKOnly
         End If

    ElseIf StrAction = "reset" Then
        ws.Users(StrUsername).NewPassword "", ""
        MsgBox "Password Successfully Reset", vbOKOnly
    Else
        MsgBox "You must Select a StrAction of either '" &amp; "Change'" &amp; _
          "' or '" &amp; "Reset'.", vbOKOnly
    End If

    ws.Close
    Set ws = Nothing
    Exit Sub

    ChangeResetPassword:
         MsgBox Err.Description
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Save the module as SecurityCode and close it.
<P>
</OL><h3>Allowing a User to Change His or Her Own Password</h3>
 
<P>
The next sample function allows a user to change his or her own (and only
his or her own) password. For the function to operate correctly, it must be
passed the Username, Old Password, and New Password of the user.
<P>
To create this example, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open your database in Microsoft Access 7.0 or 97.

<P><LI>In the Database window, click the Modules tab, and select the
   SecurityCode module that you created in the example above.

<P><LI>Click Design, and type or paste the following code:
<P>
<P><PRE>    Public Sub ChangeUserPassword(StrUsername As String, StrOldPassword _
    As String, StrNewPassword As String)
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    On Error GoTo ChangeUserPassword_Err:
    DBEngine(0).Users(StrUsername).NewPassword StrOldPassword, _
      StrNewPassword
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    MsgBox "Password Change Successful", vbInformation
    Exit Sub
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    ChangeUserPassword_Err:
<PRE></PRE>        MsgBox Err.Description

    End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Save the Module and close it.
<P>
</OL><h3>Usage Example</h3>
 
<P>
The following sample form and associated code uses both functions that you
created earlier in the article to demonstrate their functionality. The form
contains text boxes that must be filled with appropriate pieces of
information that are fed to the sample functions and command buttons to run
the functions themselves.
<P>
The form allows users to:
<P>
<PRE>   - Change their own password.

</PRE></OL>The form allows administrators to:
<P>
<PRE>   - Reset a user's password.
   - Change a user's password.

</PRE>To create the form, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new blank form and save it as frmChangePasswords.

<P><LI>With the frmChangePasswords form open in Design View, add the following
   text box, label, and command button controls. Each label is associated
   with a specific text box and should be placed near the text box on
   the form.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Text Box:
      -----------------
      Name: txtUserName
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Label:
      --------------------
