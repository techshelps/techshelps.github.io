The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro or procedure
to set the Address or SubAddress property of a hyperlink, the hyperlink's
Name, Address, and SubAddress properties become corrupted.
<P>
Specifically, the properties contain underscores (___) or a combination of
underscores and other characters instead of the correct values.
<P>
If you click the hyperlink, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot open the specified file.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you set the Address or SubAddress property of a
hyperlink outside of the Add method of hyperlinks. For example, any of the
following lines of code cause the problem:
<P>
<PRE>   Sheets(1).Hyperlinks(1).Address = "NewAddress"
   Sheets(1).Hyperlinks(1).SubAddress = "NewSubAddress"

   mylink.Address = "NewAddress"
   mylink.SubAddress = "NewSubAddress"

</PRE>Note that this problem does not occur in Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without

language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact

<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>If you want to change the properties of an existing hyperlink, re-add the
hyperlink in the same cell where it already exists, but specify different
properties as needed. For example, if you want to change only the Address
property of the existing hyperlink in cell A1 of Sheet1, you could use the
following code:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ChangeAddress()

       ' Store the old hyperlink so you can get its properties.
       '
       Set oldLink = Worksheets("Sheet1").Cells(1, 1).Hyperlinks(1)

       ' Store the old Anchor and SubAddress properties. Note that the
       ' oldAddress line is optional and that the oldAnchor line must
       ' be preceded by "Set" since it is using a Range.
       '
       Set oldAnchor = oldLink.Range
       oldAddress = oldLink.Address
       oldSubAddress = oldLink.SubAddress

       ' Create the new link using the new Address and the original
       ' Anchor and SubAddress.
       '
       Set newLink = Worksheets("Sheet1").Hyperlinks.Add( _
           Anchor:=oldAnchor, _
           Address:="NewAddress", _
           SubAddress:=oldSubAddress)

   End Sub

</PRE>You can use this method to change the Anchor, Address, and SubAddress
properties of the hyperlink; just modify the "Set newLink =" line so that
it uses the correct old properties and new properties.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows and Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition,
you can use a macro to create hyperlinks within a worksheet. To do this,
you use the Add method of the Hyperlinks collection.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows, you can also edit an existing hyperlink
by setting the Address and SubAddress properties of the hyperlink to
different values. If you attempt to do this in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh
Edition, the hyperlink will become corrupted, and it will not work
correctly when you click it.
