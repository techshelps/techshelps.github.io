<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can use a macro to count the occurrences of a
specific character in a cell, or range of cells. You can also use a formula
to accomplish the task.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact

</PRE><h3>Sample Visual Basic Procedure</h3>
 
<P>
The following Visual Basic procedure prompts you for a character (or
characters), then searches through the currently selected cell, or range of
cells, and displays a message box showing the total number of occurrences
of that character or character string. This works for all alphanumeric
characters.
<P>
<PRE>   Dim Count As Integer
   Dim Target As String
   Dim Cell As Object
   Dim N As Integer

   Sub Target_Count()
      Count = 0
      Target = InputBox("character(s) to find?")
      If Target = "" Then GoTo Done
         For Each Cell In Selection
            N = InStr(1, cell.Value, target)
            While N &lt;&gt; 0
               Count = count + 1
               N = InStr(n + 1, cell.Value, target)
            Wend
         Next Cell
      MsgBox count &amp; " Occurrences of " &amp; target
   Done:
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Excel 4.0 Macro</h3>
 
<P>
The following macro example prompts you for a character, then searches
through the currently selected cell, or range of cells, and displays a
message box showing the total number of occurrences of that character. This
works for all alphanumeric characters.
<P>
<PRE>   A1 :  count=0
   A2 :  target=INPUT("Enter character to count: ",2)
   A3 :  =IF(or(target="",target=false),HALT())
   A4 :  = FOR.CELL("TheCell")
   A5 :  =  FOR("counter",1,LEN(TheCell))
   A6 :  =   IF(MID(TheCell,counter,1)=target)
   A7 :       count=count+1
   A8 :  =   END.IF()
   A9 :  =  NEXT()
   A10: =NEXT()
   A11: =ALERT("Occurrences of "&amp;target&amp;": "&amp;count)
   A12: =RETURN()

</PRE>If you prefer not to use a macro, use the following formula:
<P>
<PRE>   {=SUM(LEN(range)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(range,"a","")))}

</PRE>where "range" is the range in question, and "a" is replaced by the
character you want to count.
<P>
If you are concerned about a single cell, this could be simplified to:
<P>
<PRE>   =LEN(range)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(range,"a",""))

</PRE>You can also create a version which will count the number of occurrences of
any string within the range using the following variation of the formula:
<P>
<PRE>   {=SUM(LEN(range)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(range,"text","")))/LEN("text")}

</PRE>and replace "text" with the string that you want to count.
