<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates how to use a sample function to generate a
random file name that can be used for a temporary file.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access versions 1.x and 2.0. For more information about Access Basic,
please refer to the "Introduction to Programming" manual in Microsoft
Access version 1.x or the "Building Applications" manual in Microsoft
Access version 2.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes it is necessary for an application to create a file that is
used temporarily and then deleted. The names of temporary files are
important because you do not want your application to inadvertently
overwrite an existing file.
<P>
In such cases, you can create and use the user-defined function called
MakeTempFileName(). This function accepts a file extension and returns a
string representing a non-existent, random file name with the file
extension you specified. The file name includes a path to your Windows
Temp folder (directory) so that the temporary file is placed in the same
folder Windows uses to write its temporary files. This is handy for those
who perform periodic maintenance on their hard drive and delete any
leftover temporary files in the Windows Temp folder.
<P>
To create the sample function MakeTempFileName(), follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a module and type the following procedure:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Function MakeTempFileName(Extension As String) As String
      On Error Resume Next
      Dim Isfile As Integer, FHandle As Integer, Cntr As Integer
      Dim WinTemp As String, TF As String
<PRE></PRE>         Isfile = False
         FHandle = FreeFile

      Do
         WinTemp = Environ("TEMP") &amp; "\"
         For Cntr = 1 To 8
         WinTemp = WinTemp &amp; Mid(LTrim(Str(CInt(Rnd * 10))), 1, 1)
         Next
            TF = Trim(WinTemp$) &amp; "." &amp; Extension

         Open TF For Output As #Fhandle
      Debug.Print TF
         Print #FHandle, "This is a Temp file"
      Loop While Err &gt; 0
      Close #FHandle
      MakeTempFileName = TF

   End Function

</PRE><P><LI>Type the following line in the Debug window (or Immediate window in
   versions 1.x and 2.0):
<P>
<P><PRE>      TempFileName$ = MakeTempFileName("TMP")
</PRE><P>
   Note that the name of the temporary file is displayed in the Debug
   window. The file contains the line "This is a Temp file." After you
   have verified that the file exists in your Temp folder, you can delete
   it.
