The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition 
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you run a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro that displays a
customized Office Assistant balloon, the balloon may not appear on the
screen. When this problem occurs, the value of the BalloonError property of
the Assistant object is set to 4 (msoBalloonErrorBadPictureRef).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The Text property of the new balloon has been set to include a
   picture, as in the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      With Assistant.NewBalloon
<PRE></PRE>          .Text = "{&lt;type&gt; &lt;location&gt; &lt;sizing_factor&gt;}"
          .Show
      End With

   &lt;Type&gt; is either bmp, wmf, or pict, &lt;location&gt; is the path to the
   picture, and &lt;sizing_factor&gt; is an optional value that sets the width of
   the picture.

    -and-

</PRE><LI>The &lt;location&gt; includes a space, as in the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      .Text = "{bmp C:\Windows\My Picture.bmp}"
</PRE><P>
</UL>Specifically, the problem occurs because the space in the path causes the
file location to be evaluated as "C:\Windows\My", not "C:\Windows\My
Picture.bmp". If the picture cannot be found in the specified location, the
balloon cannot be displayed, and the BalloonError property is set to 4.

<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>To prevent this problem from occurring, enclose the location of the picture
file in a double set of quotation marks, as in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   With Assistant.NewBalloon
       .Text = "{bmp ""C:\Windows\My Picture.bmp""}"
       .Show
   End With

</PRE>When you run the macro, the balloon appears correctly, and the value of the
BalloonError property is zero (0).
