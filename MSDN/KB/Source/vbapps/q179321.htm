<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates a sample user-defined Visual Basic for
Applications procedure you can use to set different paper tray sources for
the pages of a report using the PrtDevMode property.
<P>

<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/</A></B>

</PRE>When you use the PrtDevMode property, keep the following printer driver
characteristics in mind:

<UL><LI>Set only those members that the printer driver supports. For example,
   if you set a custom page size for a driver that does not support a
   custom page size, you may encounter unexpected results.

<LI>Set the PrtDevMode property's Fields member if you change any other
   member to let the printer driver know which members you are changing.

<LI>Change only the first 68 bytes of the PrtDevMode property. Printer
   drivers are able to store driver-specific information after the first
   68 bytes; therefore, it is important not to overwrite this information.
<P>
</UL>This article assumes that you want to print the first page of your report
from one paper source and the second page of your report from another paper
source.

<P><h3>Steps for Printing Pages of Report from Different Paper Trays</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in Microsoft Access
   2.0).

<P><LI>Create a new module and type the following information in the
   Declarations section of the module:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Type zwtDevModeStr
<PRE></PRE>        RGB As String * 94
      End Type

      Type zwtDeviceMode

        dmBits As Long
        dmPW As Long
        dmDFI As Long
        dmDRr As Long
      End Type

</PRE><P><LI>Type the following procedure:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub setPaperSource(rptName As String)
         Dim Rpt As Report
         Dim dm As zwtDeviceMode
         Dim DevString As zwtDevModeStr

         DoCmd.SelectObject A_REPORT, Rpt.Name, True
         DoCmd.PrintOut A_PAGES, 1, 1

         ' Set Paper Tray for page 2
         DoCmd.OpenReport rptName, acDesign
         Set Rpt = Reports(rptName)

         dm.dmDefaultSource = 1  '1 = Upper Tray, 2 = Lower Tray, 5 = _
                                 'Envelope Feeder
         LSet DevString = dm
         Mid$(DevModeExtra, 1, 68) = DevString.RGB
         Rpt.PrtDevMode = DevModeExtra
         DoCmd.Save A_REPORT, Rpt.Name
         DoCmd.SelectObject A_REPORT, Rpt.Name, True
         DoCmd.PrintOut A_PAGES, 2, 2
         DoCmd.Close     ' Closes the report
         DoCmd.SetWarnings True

      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>To test this procedure, type the following line in the Debug window,
   and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      setPaperSource("Invoice")
</PRE><P>
   Note that the first two pages of the Invoice report prints. The first
   page prints from the lower tray and the second page prints from the
   upper tray.
