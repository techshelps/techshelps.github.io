<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article describes a method that you can use to transfer the ownership
of a newly created table to a specific owner. For example, if the
functionality within a secured database enables the current user to import
a table, that user will be the owner of the table and will have full
permissions on that table.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access version 2.0. For more information about Access Basic, please refer
to the "Building Applications" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If your secured database application enables users to import a table, those
users will be the owners of the table and will have full permissions on
that table. The function below demonstrates how you can programmatically
create a secured session as a user different from the current user and
transfer ownership of an imported object from the current user to another
user.
<P>
The following function should be called within a macro, a function or a Sub
procedure that imports the table you want to secure. You should call the
function immediately after importing the table to ensure permission have
been set.
<P>
NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) at the end of a line
is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the
end of the line when re-creating this code in Access Basic.
<P>
<PRE>   Function ChangeOwner(NewTable As String, NewOwner As String, PWord As _
      String)

      Dim NewWS As WorkSpace
      Dim db As Database
      Dim cnt As Container
      Dim doc As Document

      Set db = CurrentDB()

      'Create a new session and append it to the Workspaces collection.
      Set NewWS = dbengine.CreateWorkspace("NewWS", NewOwner, PWord)

      'Assign variables for the table's Container and Document objects.
      Set cnt = db.Containers("Tables")
      Set doc = cnt.Documents(NewTable)

      'Establish new owner of the imported table.
      doc.Owner = NewOwner

      'Cleanup
      NewWS.Close
      db.Close

      'Pass success status back to caller.
      ChangeOwner = True

    End Function

</PRE>To use this function, you can use either of the two methods below. Each
presumes that the table has just been imported, that the table is named
MyTable, and that a valid user exists named MyNewOwner with a password of
MyNewOwnerPass.
<P>
NOTE: In the following examples, an underscore (_) at the end of a line is
used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the end
of the line when re-creating these examples in Access Basic.
<P>
<PRE>   Using a Macro
   -------------

      Action: RunCode
      Function Name: ChangeOwner("MyTable","MyNewOwner", _
                     "MyNewOwnerPass")

   Using Visual Basic for Applications
   -----------------------------------

      Dim IsOwnerChanged as Integer
      IsOwnerChanged = ChangeOwner("MyTable", _
                       "MyNewOwner","MyNewOwnerPass")
