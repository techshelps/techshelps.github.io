<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In November 1997, Microsoft identified a new macro virus that infects
workbooks in Microsoft Excel for Windows called the PLDT macro virus, also
known as PLDT97 or Laroux E.
<P>
This article contains information about this macro virus, including how to
tell when your workbooks have been infected and how to remove the macro
virus from your workbooks.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>General Information About Macro Viruses</h3>
 
<P>
The PLDT macro virus is a strain of the Laroux macro virus, which was first
identified in July 1996. For more information about the Laroux macro virus,
please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : XL: Q&amp;A About Excel Macro/Laroux Macro Virus

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q150990.htm">Q150990</A></B>
   TITLE     : WE1280: Virus Search Add-in

</PRE>Because of the design of the PLDT macro virus, it cannot be detected or
removed by the Microsoft Excel Virus Search add-in, version 1.2, or the
Microsoft Excel 97 Virus Search add-in, version 2.0. The following section
explains how to manually detect and remove this macro virus.
<P>
<P><h3>Detecting and Removing the PLDT Macro Virus</h3>
 
<P>
If the PLDT macro virus has infected any of your workbooks, the workbook
Pldt.xls will be found in one of the following folders on your computer:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Excel\Xlstart

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Xlstart

</PRE>Also, any workbooks that are infected by the macro virus will contain a
Visual Basic module called "Pldt."
<P>
To remove the PLDT macro virus from your workbooks, perform the following
steps:
<P>
<P><h3>In Microsoft Excel 97</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options. Click the General tab. Click the
    Macro Virus Protection checkbox, and then click OK.

<P><LI> Quit Microsoft Excel 97.

<P><LI>Using Windows Explorer, go to the C:\Program Files\Microsoft
    Office\Office\Xlstart folder. Select the file Pldt.xls. On the File
    menu, click Delete. Click Yes if you are asked if you want to move the
    file to the Recycle Bin.

<P><LI> Start Microsoft Excel 97.

<P><LI>Open a workbook that you believe to be infected with the PLDT macro
    virus. If you receive the following message:
<P>
       The workbook you are opening contains macros. Some macros may
       contain viruses that could be harmful to your computer.
<P>
       If you are sure this workbook is from a trusted source, click
       'Enable Macros'. If you are not sure and want to prevent any
       macros from running, click 'Disable Macros'.
<P>
    click Disable Macros.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>Click Project Explorer on the View menu to make sure the Project
    Window is visible.

<P><LI>In the Project window, click the plus sign (+) to the left of the
    word Modules below the name of the workbook you just opened.
<P>
    If a module named "pldt" is listed, right-click the module name. On
    the shortcut menu, click "Remove pldt." Click No when you are asked
    if you want to export the module.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click "Close and Return to Microsoft Excel."

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save. On the File menu, click Close.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 5-10 for all workbooks that you believe to be infected
    with the PLDT macro virus.
<P>
    Also, if any other workbooks, such as Personal.xls, are listed in the
    Project window in the Visual Basic Editor, click the plus sign to the
    left of the word Modules below each workbook's name. If any modules
    named "pldt" are displayed, right-click the module name, and then click
    "Remove pldt" on the shortcut menu.
<P>
</OL>Until you are absolutely certain that the PLDT macro virus has been
completely removed from your computer, click Disable Macros every time you
open a workbook. If you open a workbook that contains the PLDT macro virus
and click Enable Macros, the macro virus will begin to infect your
workbooks again.
<P>
NOTE: If you have exchanged workbooks with anyone else, you should alert
them to the possibility that their workbooks may also be infected by the
PLDT macro virus.
<P>
<P><h3>In Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Using Windows Explorer, go to the Xlstart folder for your version of
   Microsoft Excel. Select the file Pldt.xls, and click Delete on the File
   menu. Click Yes if you are asked if you want to move the file to the
   Recycle Bin.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Open a workbook that you believe to be infected with the PLDT macro
   virus. As you open the workbook, hold down the SHIFT key; this will
   prevent any Auto_Open macros in the workbook from running.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, point to Sheet, and click Unhide. If "pldt" is
   listed in the Unhide Sheet list box, select it, and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Delete Sheet. Click OK to permanently delete the
   sheet.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save. On the File menu, click Close.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 4-7 for all workbooks that you believe to be infected with
   the PLDT macro virus.
<P>
   Also, if you have a personal macro workbook (Personal.xls), you may need
   to unhide it (on the Window menu, click Unhide), perform steps 5 and 6,
   and then rehide the personal macro workbook (on the Window menu, click
   Hide). When you quit Microsoft Excel, click Yes to save changes to the
   personal macro workbook.
<P>
</OL>If you are uncertain as to whether or not a workbook is infected with the
PLDT macro virus, hold down the SHIFT key while you open the workbook, and
then perform steps 5-7.
<P>
NOTE: If you have exchanged workbooks with anyone else, you should alert
them to the possibility that their workbooks may also be infected by the
PLDT macro virus.
