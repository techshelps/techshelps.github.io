<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you open a workbook that contains a reference to a
shortcut to a workbook, one of the following symptoms occurs:

<UL><LI>If the workbook that you open contains the defined name "Auto_Open" that
   refers to a macro in the shortcut to the workbook, you receive the
   following error message
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot find '&lt;filename&gt;'!&lt;macro&gt;, which has been assigned to run each
      time [&lt;book&gt;] is opened. Continuing could cause errors. Cancel
      opening [&lt;book&gt;]?
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the shortcut to the workbook that
   contains your macro, &lt;macro&gt; is the name of the macro you want to run
   automatically, &lt;book&gt; is the name of the workbook that you are opening
   that contains the Auto_Open defined name.

<LI>If the workbook that you open contains a link to a cell in the shortcut
   to the workbook, the File Not Found dialog box appears (if you choose to
   reestablish the link).
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Windows 95, you can create a shortcut to any program,
document, or printer, and put this shortcut in any folder or on the
desktop. This makes it easy to access the objects that you use most
frequently. However, if you create a link or reference to a shortcut to a
workbook in a Microsoft Excel workbook, the above behavior occurs because
Microsoft Excel does not recognize the workbook that the shortcut refers
to.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, create the link or reference to the original
workbook instead of to a shortcut to the workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
