<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft introduced Priority Office Developer Support to meet your
growing need for quality development-related support. By using this fee-
based option, you have access to support engineers trained specifically
in this area. As a result, your issues will be resolved more quickly and
accurately. For individuals and organizations, effective support of
Microsoft products comes from choosing the appropriate support option.
<P>
Microsoft Office Standard Edition includes two standard Office Developer
incidents at no charge. Microsoft Office Professional Edition includes four
standard Office Developer incidents at no charge. Additional incidents are
available at $55 per incident. For additional information or to purchase
any of the Microsoft Technical Support fee-based options in the U.S., call
Microsoft Support Sales at (800) 936-3500 from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.
Pacific time, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. Please note that
technical support is not available through this number.
<P>
All Microsoft customers have 24-hour access to a wide range of no-cost
and low-cost information services that also provide information about
programming with Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications. This
article discusses some of the cost-effective and expedient ways for you
to access technical information about developing custom solutions with
Microsoft Excel. By using the resources suggested in the "More
Information" section of this article, you can answer many of your
development questions without speaking directly to a Microsoft Technical
Support engineer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Online Help</h3>
 
<P>
The Help files included with Microsoft Excel are useful for learning the
syntax for specific Visual Basic for Applications methods or properties.
To bring up the context-sensitive Help file for a particular Visual
Basic for Applications command, type the command on a module sheet, and
then press the F1 key. You will be provided with the syntax, a
description, and an example of how the command is used.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Knowledge Base on the Internet's World Wide Web</h3>
 
<P>
Many articles in the Knowledge Base contain sample code for common
Visual Basic for Applications solutions. The advantage of accessing the
articles online is that you can copy the code from your browser and
paste it on a module sheet. This saves you the time it would take to
manually enter the code.
