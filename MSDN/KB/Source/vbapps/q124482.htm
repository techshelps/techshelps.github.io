<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Project sample macro in the "More Information" section of
this article sums numeric values from a list of visible tasks and displays
the total in a task row at the bottom of the list.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

<P>
The following macro sums the values from the Number1 fields of all visible
tasks. After you run this macro, a new task named "Total" will be created
and displayed at the end of the active project. The Number1 field in this
task will contain the sum of the Number1 values for all other visible
tasks.

</OL><h3>Modifying the Macro</h3>
 
<P>
To sum values from fields other than Number1, replace the reference to
Number1 on the line commented with "Field to sum" with the name of the
field for which you want to derive a total. To place the total in a field
other than Number1, replace the reference to Number1 on the line commented
with "Field containing total" with the name of the field into which you
actually want to place the total.
<P>
For example, if the field you want to sum is a calculated field, such as
Cost or Actual Cost, then the sum must be placed in a non-calculated field,
such as Cost1 or Number1. Therefore, to get the total cost fields for all
visible tasks and place the total in the Cost1 field of the "Total" task,
you would change the indicated lines as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   fTotal = fTotal + oTask.Cost   ' Field to Sum
   oTotalTask.Cost1 = fTotal      ' Field containing total
