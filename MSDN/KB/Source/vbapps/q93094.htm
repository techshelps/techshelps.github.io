The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article discusses the DeleteControl and DeleteReportControl
statements and the CreateGroupLevel() function. If you intend to write
your own Form Wizard or Report Wizard, you can use the commands to delete
controls on a form or report that is available in Design view, and you can
use the function to create groups on a report that is available in Design
view.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access versions 1.x and 2.0. For more information about Access Basic,
please refer to the "Introduction to Programming" manual in Microsoft
Access version 1.x or the "Building Applications" manual in Microsoft
Access version 2.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use DeleteControl and DeleteReportControl commands to delete a
control that exists on a form or report in Design view. Both commands
require a string value that represents the name of the form or report and
a string value that represents the name of the control.
<P>
DeleteControl and DeleteReportControl are statements, not functions. They
do not return a value.
<P>
The example below creates a form, creates a button on the form, displays a
message, and then deletes the button on the form. To create the form,
follow these steps.
<P>
<P><h3>In Microsoft Access 2.0, 7.0, and 97</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Dim MyForm As Form, MyControl As Control
   Set MyForm = CreateForm()
   Set MyControl = CreateControl(MyForm.Name, 104)
   MsgBox "About to Delete " &amp; MyControl.Name
   DeleteControl MyForm.Name, MyControl.Name

</PRE><h3>In Microsoft Access 1.x</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Dim MyForm As Form, MyControl As Control
   Set MyForm = CreateForm()
   Set MyControl = CreateControl(MyForm.FormName, 104)
   MsgBox "About to Delete " &amp; MyControl.ControlName
   DeleteControl MyForm.FormName, MyControl.ControlName

</PRE>When you delete a control using DeleteControl or DeleteReportControl,
there is no visual feedback that the control is gone if the form or report
is not minimized. The control still appears as if it were not deleted
even though you can not click it to give it focus. To make the deleted
control disappear, you must repaint the form design window by minimizing
it and then restoring it.
<P>
If you have a report available in Design view, you can create groups for
it in a procedure by using the CreateGroupLevel() function. Here is the
syntax for CreateGroupLevel():
<P>
<PRE>   Function CreateGroupLevel(ReportName$,Expression$,
                             HasHeader$, HasFooter$)

</PRE>ReportName is a string expression representing the report name.
<P>
Expression is a string expression representing the name of the field or
calculated field that you want to group by.
<P>
HasHeader and HasFooter indicate whether the group includes a group
header or group footer, respectively. The values are True and False.
<P>
When it runs, CreateGroupLevel() adds a group at the innermost level. For
example, if one group already exists, CreateGroupLevel() creates a second
group within the first group. CreateGroupLevel() returns a number
indicating which level it created, beginning with zero. In the example
just mentioned, CreateGroupLevel() returns 1 because it is the second
group, and the first group was Group zero.
