<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When writing programming code that retrieves a set of calendar appointments
in Microsoft Outlook 97, you cannot retrieve all of the recurring
appointments unless you set the IncludeRecurrences property to True for the
collection of items.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

</PRE>In Outlook, you can create a recurring appointment, such as a meeting that
occurs every Monday. Using Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) or
Visual Basic for Applications automation code, you can use various methods
to retrieve all or a subset of appointments from the Outlook Calendar. The
Find and Restrict methods are typically used to retrieve a subset of all
the appointments, such as the appointments for a particular month.
<P>
For example, assume a recurring appointment was originally created on the
first Monday in January and that the appointment was set to recur on every
Monday thereafter. If you use the Restrict method to retrieve all of the
appointments in January, by default only the appointment for the first
Monday is returned. If you use the Restrict method to retrieve the
appointments in February, none of the recurring appointments are retrieved.
<P>
When programmatically referring to a group of appointments, these items are
part of the Items Collection Object, which is a topic in the Vbaoutl.hlp
file. In addition to the example in that topic, which returns all items in
a folder, you can use the Find or Restrict methods to create a smaller
collection (or subset) of appointments.
<P>
Once you specify the proper collection, use the IncludeRecurrences property
to add all of the recurring appointments to the collection.
<P>
The following code example (with additional comments) is from the
Vbaoutl.hlp file. It assumes you have already set up one recurring
appointment in your calendar and that you have the Calendar folder
selected:
<P>
<PRE>Sub GetRecurrences()
   ' This example is VBA automation code and assumes you have the
   ' Outlook Object Library referenced.
   Dim myOlApp As Outlook.Application
   Set myOlApp = New Outlook.Application
   ' Set myItems to all of the items in the folder
   Set myItems = myOlApp.ActiveExplorer.CurrentFolder.Items
   ' Sort the collection based on the start date/time of the appt.
   myItems.Sort "[Start]"
   ' Set the IncludeRecurrences property to make sure all of the
   ' recurring appointments are also included in the collection.
   myItems.IncludeRecurrences = True
   ' Display one of the recurring appointments which have been included.
   MsgBox "The fifth instance of the recurring appointment " &amp; _
      "occurs on:" &amp; myItems.Item(5).Start
End Sub
