<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Visual Basic for Applications code that uses Automation to
control any of the products listed at the beginning of this article, you
may receive an error message that is similar to either of the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '424':
   Object required

    -or-

   Run-time error '-2147221168(80040150)':
   OLE Automation error

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if you run RegClean, version 3.0 or 4.0, on your
computer, and then attempt to run Visual Basic for Applications code that
uses Automation to control another program.
<P>
This problem occurs when RegClean 3.0 or 4.0 removes the keys that are
required to use Automation.
<P>
NOTE: The RegClean utility has been updated.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, download and install a custom registry file that
replaces keys that are removed by RegClean.
<P>
You can also download an updated version of RegClean 4.1. The updated
version of RegClean prevents the problem from occurring. RegClean 4.1 does
NOT remove the keys that are required to use Automation.
<P>
The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
RegClean 4.1 for Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The RegClean utility, which is included on the Microsoft Office 97 Resource
Kit compact disc, is designed to analyze your registry. After RegClean
analyzes the registry, it removes all corrupted, damaged, and/or
unnecessary keys.
<P>
If you run RegClean 3.0 or 4.0 on your computer, it may remove the
following set of registry keys:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Interface\{00020400-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}

</PRE>This set of keys is originally created in the registry by the Microsoft
Windows 95 or Windows NT Setup program. Although these keys may be modified
by the setup program for another program, they are not recreated by any
other setup program. If these keys are removed from the registry,
reinstalling programs, such as Microsoft Office 97, does NOT restore the
keys.
<P>
Because these keys must be present to use Automation, you receive any of
the error messages in this article if they are missing. You can restore the
missing keys by downloading and installing the registry file mentioned in
this article.
<P>
For more information about RegClean 4.1, please see the following articles
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
