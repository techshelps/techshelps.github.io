<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOM</h2>
 
<P>
When you record a macro to find text formatted with a specific language,
the LanguageID property is not recorded.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
After you record the macro, stop the macro recorder and edit the macro to
include the LanguageID property.
<P>
The following sample macro was recorded to find the word "test." In this
example, the LanguageID property has been added and the LanguageID
constant has been set to English(United States).
<P>
<PRE>   Sub FindLanguageProofing()
      Selection.Find.ClearFormatting
      With Selection.Find
         .Text = "test"
         .Replacement.Text = ""
         .Forward = True
         .Wrap = wdFindContinue
         .Format = True
         .MatchCase = False
         .MatchWholeWord = False
         .MatchWildcards = False
         .MatchSoundsLike = False
         .MatchAllWordForms = False
         'Change the constant, wdEnglishUS, to
         'the language constant you want to
         'include as part of a search criteria.
         .LanguageID = wdEnglishUS   '&lt;---Add this line.
      End With
      Selection.Find.Execute
   End Sub
