<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOM</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you use Visual Basic commands to adjust the
dimensions of controls in custom dialog boxes by manipulating the Top,
Left, Height, and Width properties of the controls, the controls will
always "snap" to certain numbers. For example, if you change the Left
property of a control, it will always snap to a multiple of 0.75.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because of the design of the custom dialog box system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
"Snapping" occurs when a control is placed in a certain position that is
not precisely supported in a custom dialog box. For example, the Left
property of a control always snaps to the next lowest multiple of 0.75. If
you change the Left property of a control to any of the following values,
the Left property will then snap to the indicated value:
<P>
<PRE>   When &lt;Control&gt;.Left        It snaps
   is set to this value       to this value
   ----------------------------------------

   0                          0
   0.25                       0
   0.50                       0
   0.75                       0.75
   1.00                       0.75
   1.25                       0.75
   1.50                       1.50

</PRE>If you try to set the Left property of a control to 1.12 or 1.25, for
example, Microsoft Excel will snap the control's Left property to
0.75, because that is the greatest multiple of 0.75 less than or equal
to 1.12 or 1.25.
<P>
In addition, if one property is changed by snapping, it may affect other
related properties. For example, in the Visual Basic code example
below, an edit box is initially created with a Top value of 50 and a
Height value of 15. The Top value initially snaps to 49.5; however,
when the Height value snaps, the Top value is changed to 47.25, even
though 49.5 is a valid Top value. The Left and Width values are
similarly related. The final Top, Left, Height, and Width values will
always be valid, but you may observe controls moving slightly because
of snapping.
<P>
Listed here are the guidelines that Microsoft Excel uses when
determining how a property of a control will be snapped.
<P>
Note: The values may vary slightly in Microsoft Excel 97 from those listed
below, but the behavior is the same.
<P>
<PRE>   Control Type       Units Snapped to
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   ALL CONTROLS       The Left property of all controls snaps to the
                      nearest multiple of 0.75 less than or equal to the
                      indicated value.

                      The Top property of all controls snaps to the
                      nearest multiple of 0.75 less than or equal to the
                      indicated value.

   Edit Boxes         The Height property of edit boxes and labels use
   and Labels         the following table to determine the true Height
                      value:

                      Height Set to   Height Snaps to
                      -------------------------------

                      38.25 - 47.75   42.75

                      For subsequent ranges, add 9.75 for each range.

                      The Width property of edit boxes and labels snaps to
                      the nearest multiple of 0.75 less than or equal to
                      the indicated value.

   Buttons            The Height property of buttons snaps to the nearest
                      multiple of 0.75 less than or equal to the indicated
                      value, but no less than 15.75.

                      The Width property of buttons snaps to the nearest
                      multiple of 0.75 less than or equal to the indicated
                      value, but no less than 3.00.

   Dialog Box Frame   All properties of a dialog frame snap to the nearest
                      multiple of 0.75 less than or equal to the indicated
                      value.

   Group Boxes        The Height property of group boxes snaps to the
                      nearest multiple of .75 less than or equal to the
                      indicated value, but no less than 18.75.

                      The Width property of group boxes snaps to the
                      nearest multiple of 0.75 less than or equal to the
                      indicated value, but no less than 23.25.

   Check Boxes        The Height property of check boxes is always 16.50.

                      The Width property of check boxes snaps to the
                      nearest multiple of 0.75 less than or equal to the
                      indicated value, but no less than 23.25.

   Option Buttons     The Height property of option buttons is always
                      16.50.

                      The Width property of option buttons snaps to the
                      nearest multiple of 0.75 less than or equal to the
                      indicated value, but no less than 23.25.

   List Boxes         The Height property of list boxes uses the following
                      table to determine the true Height value:

                      Height Set to   Height Snaps to
                      -------------------------------
                      0.00  - 26.75   21.75

The following subroutine creates a new dialog sheet, adds an edit box
to it, changes the Top, Left, Height, and Width properties of the
edit box, and then displays what the various properties have snapped
to.

Sub ControlSnapDemo()
   'Add a new dialog sheet to the active workbook.
   Set DemoDlg = ThisWorkbook.DialogSheets.Add
   'Add an edit box to the current dialog sheet. The dimensions
   'supplied are arbitrary.
   Set EdBox = DemoDlg.EditBoxes.Add(50, 50, 50, 50)
   'Set the Top, Left, Height, and Width properties of the edit box.
   EdBox.Top = 50
   EdBox.Left = 70
   EdBox.Height = 15
   EdBox.Width = 80
   'Construct a message string which will be shown in a message box.

   MsgString = Chr$(9) &amp; "Original Setting" &amp; Chr$(9) &amp; "Snaps To"
   MsgString = MsgString &amp; Chr$(10) &amp; "Top" &amp; Chr$(9) &amp; "50" &amp; Chr$(9)
   MsgString = MsgString &amp; Chr$(9) &amp; EdBox.Top &amp; Chr$(10) &amp; "Left"

   MsgString = MsgString &amp; Chr$(9) &amp; EdBox.Width
   'Show the message.
   MsgBox MsgString
End Sub
'----------------------------------------------------------------------

</PRE>When you run this subroutine, a new dialog sheet containing a new
edit box will be created. A message box will appear with this
message:
<P>
<PRE>            Original Setting   Snaps To
   Top      50                 47.25
   Left     70                 69.75
   Height   15                 13.5
   Width    80                 79.5

</PRE>The "snap to" values in Microsoft Excel 97 may vary slightly from the "snap
to" values in Microsoft Excel 5.x and 7.x. The "snap to" values in
Microsoft Excel 97 will tend to vary less from the original settings than
previous versions of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
The properties of the edit box have snapped to values appropriate for
an edit box. Note that the Top property has been "over-snapped"
because of the substantial change in the Height property.
