<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when you use a macro to open a file, the wrong file
may be opened.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The name of the file you are trying to open has no extension. For
   example, it is named "Noext".
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The file you are trying to open is in the same folder as another file
   whose name is identical but whose name includes a recognized file
   extension (for example, "Noext.xls").
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
A Visual Basic for Applications macro in Microsoft Excel 97 cannot use the
Workbooks.Open command to open a file with no extension if a file whose
name is identical but contains a recognized extension exists in the same
folder.
<P>
For this reason, Microsoft strongly recommends that you include an
extension when you name your data files.
<P>
Microsoft also recommends that you include the file extension in the
FileName argument of the Workbooks.Open command, if possible.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can use the Workbooks.Open command within a Visual
Basic for Applications macro to open files. Usually, the command looks
similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Workbooks.Open FileName:="Myfile.xls"

</PRE>If you have a file whose name contains no extension, you can usually open
it with the Workbooks.Open command. For example, the command would look
like this:
<P>
<PRE>   Workbooks.Open FileName:="Noext"

</PRE>This command works correctly and opens the file "Noext", unless a file
whose name is identical but includes a recognized file extension, exists in
the same folderThe following extensions are recognized by Microsoft Excel 
97:
<P>
<PRE>   xls   txt   dbf   wk3   wk1   wq1   slk   csv   dif

</PRE>If such a file exists in the same folder as the file without an
extension, that file opens instead.
