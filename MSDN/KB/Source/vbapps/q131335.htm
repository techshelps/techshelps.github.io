<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you record a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro to edit the 
links of an embedded chart, and you run the recorded macro, the links are 
not changed. This problem does not occur with separate chart sheets.
<P>

<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>To edit the links of an embedded chart in Microsoft Excel, you can edit
them manually or use a Visual Basic Formula command to change the links of
each series of the chart, as in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(1).Formula = _
       "=SERIES(,,'[CHARTB.XLS]Sheet1'!R1C1:R3C1,1)"

</PRE>Where CHARTB.XLS is the workbook that contains the data you want to change
the link to.
<P>
If you have more than one series to change, you can use the following
sample macro:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ChangeChartLinks()
       ActiveSheet.ChartObjects("Chart 1").Activate
       ' Activate the Chart to modify links in.
       SourceFile = "Book2.xls"
       ' SourceFile is the Links Source File as shown in the Links Dialog.
       ' If it is open, do not use a path.
       DestFile = ActiveWorkbook.Name
       ' DestFile is the file you want the links to refer to.
       ' In this example, the Workbook the chart is located in.
       For Each s In ActiveChart.SeriesCollection
           length = Len(SourceFile)
           pos = InStr(s.Formula, SourceFile)
           Do Until pos = 0
               s.Formula = Application.Replace(s.Formula, pos, length, _
                   DestFile)
               pos = InStr(s.Formula, SourceFile)
           Loop
       Next
       ' Loops through all of the Series in the Chart and replaces all
       ' of the references to the SourceFile with the DestFile.
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
