<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a sample Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications
macro (Sub procedure) that animates a small shape bouncing off the sides of
the screen during a slide show. This animation is started by creating an
action button linked to the macro BouncingBox. It works best if there are
no other animated objects on your slide.
<P>

language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact

</PRE>This macro assumes that you have linked the macro code to an action
setting, either to an action button or an object on the slide itself. To
start the macro, click on the linked button or object.

For more information about linking macros to action controls, search the
Help Index for "Set up a macro to run during a slide show", or ask the
Microsoft PowerPoint 97 Office Assistant.

<P><h3>Sample Visual Basic Procedure</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Sub BouncingBox()

      ' Change this constant to vary the speed of movement.
      Const Bounce As Integer = 60

      ' These constants determine the boundaries for the slide show. They
      ' are in points, 72 points to the inch, so a standard slide, which is
      ' 7.5" tall by 10" wide, would be 540 x 720. The object being
      ' animated is 40 points tall and 40 points wide. This amount is
      ' subtracted from the constants to prevent the object from leaving
      ' the slide area.
      Const sHght As Integer = 500
      Const sWdth As Integer = 680

      ' Provide a handle to the active slide show window.
      Dim show as SlideShowWindow
      Dim BounceBox as Shape

      ' Assign the current running slideshow to show.
      Set show = ActivePresentation.SlideShowWindow

      ' Assign BounceBox to the second object shape on slide 1.
      Set BounceBox = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(2)

      ' This loop moves the BounceBox object up and to the left until
      ' either the top or the left hand side is reached. The object moves
      ' on a diagonal, 45-degree line.
      '
      ' A note about coordinates. 0,0 is the upper left hand corner of the
      ' slide. 720,540 is the lower right hand corner of the slide. To move
      ' the BounceBox up and to the left, you must decrement its X,Y
      ' values.
      While BounceBox.Top &gt; 0 And BounceBox.Left &gt; 0
         BounceBox.IncrementTop -Bounce
         BounceBox.IncrementLeft -Bounce
         show.View.GotoSlide 1
      Wend

      ' This loop moves the BounceBox down to the left by the Bounce value.
      While BounceBox.Top &lt; sHght And BounceBox.Left &gt; 0
         BounceBox.IncrementTop Bounce
         BounceBox.IncrementLeft -Bounce
         show.View.GotoSlide 1
      Wend

      ' This loop moves the BounceBox down to the right by the Bounce
      ' value.
      While BounceBox.Top &lt; sHght And BounceBox.Left &lt; sWdth
         BounceBox.IncrementTop Bounce
         BounceBox.IncrementLeft Bounce
         show.View.GotoSlide 1
      Wend

      ' This loop moves the BounceBox up to the right by the Bounce value.
      While BounceBox.Top &gt; 0 And BounceBox.Left &lt; sWdth
         BounceBox.IncrementTop -Bounce
