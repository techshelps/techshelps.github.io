<P>
If you have a macro that attempts to set the formula property of a button
on a dialog sheet, it may fail, and the following error message will be
displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Run time error '1005'
   Unable to set the formula property of the button class.

</PRE>To work around this problem, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<PRE>Method 1:   Use Visual Basic for applications code to change the button's
            text property. To do this use the following example code:

             DialogSheets("Dialog1").Buttons("Button 1").Text =
             Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1").Text

            where Dialog1 is the name of your dialog sheet, Button is the
            name of the button for which you are trying to change the text,
            and Sheet1, , is the name of your worksheet from which your
            Button will get its text.

            NOTE: This code will not create a linking formula to cell A1 on
            Sheet1.

Method 2:   Manually assign the formula to the button on the dialog sheet
            by doing the following:

            1. Click the button to select it.

            2. Click the formula bar.

            3. Enter the formula, for example "=Sheet!$A$1" (without
               quotation marks).

            This will create a linking formula to cell A1 on Sheet1, and
            when the contents of this cell is changed, what is displayed on
            the button is changed as well.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior only occurs when the button is on a dialog sheet. This does
not occur when the button is on a worksheet or a chart sheet.
