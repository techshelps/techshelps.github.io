The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro
that uses the Data Access Objects (DAO) CopyFromRecordSet method to
retrieve data from an external database, you may receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   0137:30459362.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
This problem occurs if the Data argument of the CopyFromRecordSet method is
either uninitialized or is set to Nothing, as in the following examples.
<P>
<P><h3>Variable Is Uninitialized</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test1()

       Dim X As Object, D As Database, R As Object
       Set D = OpenDatabase("C:\Northwind.mdb")
       Set R = D.OpenRecordset("SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE " &amp; _
           "Country = 'None';")

       ' Variable X is uninitialized.
       ThisWorkbook.Sheets(1).Cells(1, 1).CopyFromRecordset X

   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Variable Is Set to Nothing</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test2()
       Dim D As Database, R As Object
       Set D = OpenDatabase("C:\Northwind.mdb")
       Set R = Nothing

       'Variable R is set to Nothing.
       ThisWorkbook.Sheets(1).Cells(1, 1).CopyFromRecordset R

   End Sub

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, make sure that the TypeName function of the
Data variable is set to a value other than Nothing. To do this, modify the
code so that it resembles the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ' If R is not Nothing and is not uninitialized, then...
   If TypeName(R) &lt;&gt; "Nothing" Then

       '...copy the recordset into Sheet1, cell A1.
       ThisWorkbook.Sheets(1).Cells(1, 1).CopyFromRecordSet R

   End If

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you use the CopyFromRecordSet method to copy the
contents of a recordset object into a worksheet.
<P>
If the OpenRecordSet method returns a recordset that contains no data (for
example, you used a query that returns no records), the problem described
in this article does not occur, and no data is returned to the worksheet.
The problem occurs only when the Data argument refers to a variable that
does not contain a recordset.
