<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you have a Visual Basic for Applications macro that uses the BreakLink
method in combination with an object reference, the following error may
occur:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '5825': Object has been deleted

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The link the object variable referred to no longer exists.
<P>
You receive the "Object has been deleted" message if the macro has
attempted to access an object that has been deleted. The object may have
been deleted deliberately, such as with the Delete method, or it may have
been deleted as a side effect of another operation, such as when a frame is
added around an inline shape, which deletes the original inline shape and
creates a copy of it in the frame.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without

purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see

<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>To verify that an object still exists, use the IsObjectValid method. The
following example demonstrates the use of this method.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub testObject()
      Dim sPIC As InlineShape
      Set sPIC = ActiveDocument.InlineShapes.Add("C:\Windows\bubbles.bmp")
      MsgBox IsObjectValid(sPIC)     ' This will display True
      sPIC.Delete
      MsgBox IsObjectValid(sPIC)     ' This will display False
   End Sub

</PRE>For more information about IsObjectValid, click the Office Assistant while
in the Visual Basic Editor, type "IsObjectValid," click Search, and then
click to view "IsObjectValid Property."
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please
