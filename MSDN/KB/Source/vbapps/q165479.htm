The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
<LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server version 2.0 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates two techniques for creating a data entry form in
ASP format.
<P>
NOTE: This article contains information about editing ASP files, and
assumes that you are familiar with editing ASP files. Microsoft Access
Technical Support engineers do not support customization of any HTML, HTX,
IDC, or ASP files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you export to ASP format a Microsoft Access 97 form that has its
DataEntry property set to Yes, the ASP file displays the underlying records
when you open it in a Web browser. That is because, when Microsoft Access
97 exports a form to ASP, it uses the form's RecordSource property to
generate a SQL Statement for the ASP file. It also automatically generates
the VBScript for all of the buttons on the form that enable you to move
between records, add new records, and delete existing records. The export
to ASP feature in Microsoft Access 97 was not designed to create a data
entry form that does not display records.
<P>
There are two different techniques you can use to create a data entry form
with ASP files:

<UL><LI>You can export a parameter query to ASP in order to generate an HTML
   form automatically, and then modify the ASP so that it executes an
   INSERT SQL Statement rather than a SELECT.

<LI>You can create a Microsoft Access 97 form based on a record source that
   does not return any records, and then modify the ASP file so there is
   only one navigation button, the Add New button.
<P>
</UL><h3>Method 1 - Modifying a Parameter Query Exported to ASP Format</h3>
 
<P>
Following is an example of how to create an HTML Insert Form that uses ASP
files to insert records into a Microsoft Access 97 database.
<P>
Creating the ASP Files in Microsoft Access:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access 97 and open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Create a new query called EnterShipper based on the Shippers table:
<P>
       Query: EnterShipper
       -------------------
       Type: Select Query
<P>
       Field: CompanyName
<PRE>         Table: Shippers

</PRE><P><LI>On the Query menu, click Parameters.

<P><LI>Type the following in the Query Parameters dialog box, and then click
    OK.
<P>
<PRE>       Parameter          Data Type
       ----------------------------
       [EnterName]        Text

</PRE><P><LI>Save the EnterShipper query and close it.

<P><LI>Select the EnterShipper query in the Database window, and then click
    Save As/Export on the File menu.

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, click "To an External File or Database," and
    then click OK.

<P><LI>In the "Save Query 'EnterShipper' In" dialog box, select Microsoft
    Active Server Pages (*.asp) in the Save As Type box, and type
    EnterShipper.asp in the File Name box. Note the folder where the
    exported files will be stored, and then click Export.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Active Server Pages Output Options dialog box, type
    the name of a System DSN on your Web server that points to the
    Northwind sample database.
<P>
    For more information about how to define a system DSN, search the Help
    index for "ODBC, setting up data sources," and see the following
    article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
       ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q159682.htm">Q159682</A></B>
<PRE>       TITLE     : ACC97: "Data Source Name Not Found" Err Msg Opening Web
                   Page

</PRE><P><LI>In the Server URL box, type the uniform resource locator (URL) of the
    Web server location where your ASP files will be stored. For example,
    if you will store the ASP files in the \ASPsamp folder on the \\PubTest
    server, type <B>http://pubtest/aspsamp/</B> in the Server URL box. Click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK in the Enter Parameter Value dialog box that appears. The ASP
    output creates two files: EnterShipper.HTML and EnterShipper.asp.

<P><LI>Copy EnterShipper.HTML and EnterShipper.asp to a folder on your Web
    server computer where you have both Read and Execute permission. Read
    permission is necessary to browse the HTML file, and Execute permission
    is necessary to run the ASP file. This must be the same folder
    indicated by the Server URL that you entered in step 10.
<P>
    For more information about configuring Microsoft Internet Information
    Server (IIS) permissions, please refer to the IIS Help Index, and see
    the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q162975.htm">Q162975</A></B>
<PRE>      TITLE     : ACC97: Permissions Necessary to View HTML, IDC, and ASP
                  Files

</PRE></OL><h3>Customizing the ASP file to Permit Inserting Records</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Use Notepad or another text editor to open the EnterShipper.ASP file.

<P><LI>You need to modify the ASP script so that it will use the value passed
   from the HTML form and insert it into the Shippers table of the
   Northwind sample database. Near the top of the ASP file, you will see
   some script that looks as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;%
<PRE></PRE>          sql = "SELECT Shippers.CompanyName  FROM Shippers   "
          If cstr(Param) &lt;&gt; "" And cstr(Data) &lt;&gt; "" Then
              sql = sql &amp; " WHERE [" &amp; cstr(Param) &amp; "] = " &amp; cstr(Data)
          End If
          Set rs = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset")
          rs.Open sql, conn, 3, 3
      %&gt;

   Change this part of the script to the following:

      &lt;%
          sql = "INSERT into Shippers (CompanyName) values ('" &amp;_
          Request.QueryString("[EnterName]") &amp; "');"
          conn.execute sql
          sql = "SELECT Shippers.CompanyName FROM Shippers"
          If cstr(Param) &lt;&gt; "" And cstr(Data) &lt;&gt; "" Then
              sql = sql &amp; " WHERE [" &amp; cstr(Param) &amp; "] = " &amp; cstr(Data)
          End If
          Set rs = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset")
          rs.Open sql, conn, 3, 3
      %&gt;

</PRE><P><LI>Save the EnterShipper.ASP file and close it.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0, or another Web browser program.

<P><LI>Type the URL in the address box of your Web browser to view
   EnterShipper.HTML. For example, if you saved your files in a subfolder
   called ASPsamp in the \InetPub folder on your Web server, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B>http://&lt;servername&gt;/ASPsamp/EnterShipper.HTML</B>
</PRE><P>
   Note that the URL depends upon the relative path to your files on the
   Web server.

<P><LI>The EnterShipper.HTML form opens in your Web browser and displays an
   [EnterName] box and a Run Query button. Type a name into the box and
   then click the Run Query button. A new record with the name you typed
   is inserted into the Shippers table in the Northwind sample database.
   Note that the ASP file requeries the database and returns an HTML table
   that displays the records in the Shippers table.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2 - Modifying an Exported Form That Returns No Records</h3>
 
<P>
Following is an example of how to create a Microsoft Access 97 form with a
record source that returns no records. Then you export the form to ASP
format and modify it to create a data entry form.
<P>
CAUTION: Following the steps in this example will modify the sample
database Northwind.mdb.  You may want to back up the Northwind.mdb file
and perform these steps on a copy of the database.
<P>
Creating the ASP Files in Microsoft Access:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access 97 and open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Open the Customers form in Design view.

<P><LI>Set the form's RecordSource property to an SQL statement that will not
    return any records:
<P>
       SELECT * from Customers WHERE False

<P><LI>Save the Customers form and close it.

<P><LI>Select the Customers form in the Database window, and then click Save
    As/Export on the File menu.

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, click "To an External File or Database," and
    then click OK.

<P><LI>In the "Save Form 'Customers' In" dialog box, select Microsoft Active
    Server Pages (*.asp) in the Save As Type box, and type Customers.asp in
    the File Name box. Note the folder where the exported files will be
    stored, and then click Export.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Active Server Pages Output Options dialog box, type
    the name of a System DSN on your Web server that points to the
    Northwind sample database.
<P>
    For more information about how to define a system DSN, search the Help
    index for "ODBC, setting up data sources," and see the following
    article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
       ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q159682.htm">Q159682</A></B>
<PRE>       TITLE     : ACC97: "Data Source Name Not Found" Err Msg Opening Web
                   Page

</PRE><P><LI>In the Server URL box, type the uniform resource locator (URL) of the
    Web server location where your ASP files will be stored. For example,
    if you will store the ASP files in the \ASPsamp folder on the \\PubTest
    server, type <B>http://pubtest/aspsamp/</B> in the Server URL box. Click OK.

<P><LI>Copy the two ASP files that are created, Customers.asp and
    Customersalx.asp, to a folder on your Web server computer where you
    have Execute permission. This must be the same folder indicated by the
    Server URL that you entered in step 9.
<P>
</OL><h3>Customizing the ASP file to Create a Data Entry Form</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Use Notepad or another text editor to open the Customersalx.asp file.

<P><LI>You must modify portions of the ASP script so that the only navigation
   button that displays is the Add New button. At the bottom of the ASP
   file you will see a series of &lt;OBJECT&gt; tags with the following Object
   IDs: nav_btn_MoveCancelUpdate, nav_btn_MoveDeleteRecord,
   nav_btn_MoveCommitRecord, nav_btn_MoveLastRecord,
   nav_btn_MoveNextRecord, nav_btn_MovePrevRecord, and
   nav_btn_MoveFirstRecord. Delete each of these &lt;OBJECT&gt; tags, making
   sure that you delete everything between the beginning &lt;OBJECT&gt; and the
   ending &lt;/OBJECT&gt; tag.
<P>
   NOTE: Make sure you do not delete the &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag with the
   nav_btn_MoveAddRecord Object ID.

<P><LI>Near the top of the ASP file you will see the following procedure:
<P>
<PRE>       Sub UpdateRefreshBtn()
          nav_btn_MoveCancelUpdate.Caption = "Cancel"
       End Sub

   Delete the line between the Sub and the End Sub lines so that it looks
   as follows:

       Sub UpdateRefreshBtn()
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Save the Customersalx.asp file and close it.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0, or another Web browser program.

<P><LI>Type the URL in the address box of your Web browser to view
   Customers.asp. For example, if you saved your files in a subfolder
   called ASPsamp in the \InetPub folder on your Web server, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B>http://&lt;servername&gt;/ASPsamp/EnterShipper.HTML</B>
</PRE><P>
   Note that the URL depends upon the relative path to your files on the
   Web server.

<P><LI>The Customers.asp form opens in your Web browser. Type a unique five
   letter Customer ID into the customer ID box. Type a company name into
   the company name box. Click the Add New button. A new record with the
   name you typed is inserted into the Customers table in the Northwind
   sample database.
