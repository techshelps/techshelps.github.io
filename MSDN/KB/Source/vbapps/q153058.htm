This article describes how to determine if a file has an attribute of read-
only, and how to determine if a file is opened as read-only using Microsoft 
Visual Basic for Applications code.

<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>You can determine if a file has an attribute of read-only or if the file is
opened as read-only by using the macros described in this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Set a File to Read-Only Using Windows</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel, open up a new workbook and save it to the C:\
   folder (directory) with the name "C:\Test.xls."

<P><LI>Close Test.xls, and in Windows Explorer (Windows File Manager in
   versions earlier than Windows 95), select the file you saved in
   Step 1.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Properties.

<P><LI>In the file's Properties box, click to select the Read-only check box,
   and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Set a File to Read-Only using the Macintosh</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel, open a new workbook and save it as "Test" to the
   hard disk.

<P><LI>Close Test and hide Microsoft Excel. On the desktop, open your
   hard disk by double-clicking the hard disk icon.

<P><LI>Highlight "Test," click the File menu, and then click Get Info.

<P><LI>Click on Locked, then click on the close button in the upper-left
   corner of the Info box.
<P>
</OL><h3>Sample Visual Basic Procedures</h3>
 
<P>
Example 1: A Macro to Determine if File's Read-Only Attribute is Set
<P>
The following macro will determine if a file's read-only attribute is set.
Open the file you created above, and then type the macros below in a module
sheet.
<P>
<PRE>Sub Example1()

    ' Test to see if the Read-only attribute was assigned to the file.

    If GetAttr("c:\test.xls") And vbReadOnly Then
        MsgBox "File is Read-only"
    Else
        MsgBox "File is not read-only"
    End If

End Sub

</PRE></OL>If you followed steps 1 - 5 in the "Steps to Set a File to Read-Only using
Windows" section, when you run the macro in Example 1, you will receive a
message box with the "File is Read-only" message.
<P>
Note: If you are working on a Macintosh, substitute the harddisk's name and
"test" for "c:\test.xls".  For example, if your harddisk's name is "HD",
you would type GetAttr("HD:test").
<P>
Example 2: A Macro to Determine if Active Workbook is Opened as Read-Only
<P>
The following macro will determine if the active workbook is opened as 
read-only.
<P>
<PRE>Sub Example2()

    ' Check to see if the active workbook was
    ' opened as read-only within Microsoft Excel.

    If ActiveWorkbook.ReadOnly Then
        MsgBox "File was opened as read-only"
    Else
        MsgBox "File was not opened as read-only"
    End If

End Sub

</PRE>If you open the workbook created in step 1 of the "Steps to Set a File to
Read-Only using Windows" section, when you run the macro from Example 2,
you will receive a message box with the "File was opened as read-only"
message.
