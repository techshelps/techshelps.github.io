<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a Microsoft Visual Basic application, if you use the GetObject
function with a filename to activate a file in Microsoft Excel, you
are prompted to save changes to the file when you use the Quit
method, even if you have not made any changes to the file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the GetObject function to activate the workbook as an
object linking and embedding (OLE) Automation object, a hidden
instance of Microsoft Excel starts, and the workbook is opened as
hidden. Therefore, because this change has been made to the workbook,
you are prompted to save changes when you quit the OLE Automation
object.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving a dialog box with a message to save the file after
you have activated a workbook as an OLE Automation object, close the
workbook and use the xlfalse argument to avoid saving any changes, or
the xltrue argument to save changes to the workbook. Note that when
you use this method, Microsoft Excel remains running if it was
running before you activated the OLE Automation object. The following
is an example of using this method:
<P>
<PRE>   ' Dimension variable xlsheet as object type
   Dim xlsheet As object
   ' Activate BOOK1.XLS and assign to variable xlsheet.
   ' Note: use the appropriate path for your file
   ' (this example assumes BOOK1.XLS has been saved in
   ' C:\EXCEL5\FILES).
   Set xlsheet = GetObject("C:\EXCEL5\FILES\BOOK1.XLS")
   ' Close workbook
   ' If Microsoft Excel is running when you run this procedure, the
   ' following statement does not close the application.
   ' If Microsoft Excel is not running when you run this procedure, the
   ' following statement closes the application.
   ' Use the xltrue argument in the following statement instead of
   ' xlfalse if you DO want to save changes to the file
   xlsheet.Parent.[close] xlfalse
   ' Quit Microsoft Excel
   Set xlsheet = Nothing

</PRE>Note that the DisplayAlerts method does not work in this case to
avoid the save changes dialog box.
