The information in the article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic,
   for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The contents of POSITION.TXT, a file currently being shipped with the Word
Development Kit (WDK), is available as a Help file (POSITION.HLP) for use
by Visual Basic version 3.0 programmers who want to use OLE Automation to
access WordBasic in the versions of Microsoft Word listed at the top of
this article.
<P>
POSITION.HLP provides a listing of WordBasic functions and all their
required parameters in the proper order, which is not the case in Word
version 6.x Help file.
<P>
In Microsoft Word 97 and later versions, WordBasic has been replaced with
Visual Basic for Applications. For backward compatibility, the Microsoft
Word Visual Basic for Applications language contains a WordBasic Object.
To ensure the correct WordBasic command argument positioning when using OLE
Automation, use the POSITION.HLP file for Word for Windows version 6.x.
<P>
NOTE: If your program was written to call WordBasic commands and you are
anticipating interacting with the Microsoft Word Visual Basic for
Applications language for all future development, it is recommended that
you convert your code from WordBasic to the Microsoft Word Visual Basic for
Applications commands.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WordBasic statements or functions in Microsoft Word can take named
arguments. But Visual Basic version 3.0 does not support named arguments so
when a Visual Basic version 3.0 application sends WordBasic commands
through OLE Automation, Visual Basic must specify all the parameters to a
WordBasic function in the proper order. The same call in WordBasic may only
require some of the parameters using named arguments, and those parameters
could be provided in any order.
<P>
For most WordBasic statements, the positioning of the arguments is
documented in the WordBasic Help topics or printed reference entries for
those statements. However, the arguments for some statements are not listed
in proper order, or the arguments are irrelevant or have no effect. These
arguments are not documented in WordBasic Help or in the printed reference.
<P>
For example, the InsertIndex statement corresponds to the Index tab in the
Index and Tables dialog box. The InsertIndex statement takes a number of
arguments that have to do with other tabs in the dialog box, such as the
Table of Contents tab. Because these arguments are irrelevant to inserting
an index, they are ignored and therefore not documented in WordBasic Help
or in the printed reference. But you, as a Visual Basic version 3.0 OLE
Automation programmer, need to be aware of these arguments so you can
correctly specify arguments by position.
