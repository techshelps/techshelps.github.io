The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you use the PrtDevMode property, keep the following printer driver
characteristics in mind.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft
Access version 2.0. For more information about Access Basic, please refer
to the "Building Applications" manual.

<UL><LI>Set only those members that the printer driver supports. For example,
   if you set a custom page size for a driver that does not support a
   custom page size, you may encounter unexpected results.
<P>
   Follow these steps to find out if you are using a driver that supports
   the Custom page size option:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Printers.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. In the Printers box, using the right-mouse button, right-click
       the printer name that represents the printer you are using in
       conjunction with this article. Click Properties.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    3. In the '&lt;Printer name&gt;' Properties box, click the Paper tab and view
       the Paper size box. If the Custom icon does not appear in the box,
       you will not be able to use this article.
</PRE>
<LI>Set the PrtDevMode property's Fields member if you change any other
   member to let the printer driver know which members you are changing.

<LI>Change only the first 68 bytes of the PrtDevMode property. Printer
   drivers are able to store driver-specific information after the first
   68 bytes; therefore, it is important not to overwrite this information.
<P>
</UL>To verify that a report has the correct page size, check the setting in
the PrtDevMode property. The PrtDevMode property is available only in
Visual Basic for Applications.
<P>
To create the Sub procedure, follow these steps:
<P>
NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Access 2.0 on a computer running Windows
95, you will need to modify the Type statement in step 1 to read as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>    Type str_DevMode
      RGB As String * 512
    End Type

</PRE>For more information about PrtDevMode settings in Windows 95, please see
