The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to change the default paper source used by printer drivers
in Windows 95 by using the SendKeys command within a Visual Basic for
Applications subroutine in Microsoft Excel versions 7.0 and 97.
<P>
Note that the information in this article does not pertain to earlier
versions of Microsoft Windows, because the dialog box layout in earlier
versions of Windows is somewhat different from that used in Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
The SendKeys command in Visual Basic for Applications allows you to
simulate the pressing of keys while a macro is running. By using the
correct combination of keystrokes, you can accomplish many tasks that are
not possible through normal macro commands.
<P>
For example, if you need a subroutine to display the "About Microsoft
Excel" dialog box, you could use the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   SendKeys "%ha"

</PRE>In this example, "%h" is equivalent to pressing ALT+H, which activates
the Help menu. The "a" is equivalent to selecting the "About Microsoft
Excel" menu item.
<P>
You can change the paper source used by a Windows 95 printer driver by
using commands similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   'Use ONE of the following four lines of code to determine the paper
   'source. If a different letter is required, set the value of xSource
   'accordingly.
   xSource = "a"   'Auto Select
   xSource = "u"   'Upper Tray
   xSource = "m"   'Manual Feed
   xSource = "l"   'Lower Tray

   'This line of code actually changes the paper source.
   SendKeys "%fu%o%s" &amp; xSource &amp; "~~"

</PRE>In the SendKeys command, the following actions are executed.
<P>
<PRE>   Action   Equivalent to
   -----------------------------------------------------
   %f       ALT+F. Selects the File menu.
   u        Chooses Page Setup.
   %o       ALT+O. Selects the Options button.
   %s       ALT+S. Selects the Paper Source list box.
   ~~       Presses ENTER twice to accept the changes.

</PRE>The xSource variable contains a letter that determines what paper source
is used. Depending on the value you use (usually "a," "u," "m," or "l"),
the SendKeys statement selects the appropriate paper source, and then
simulates two presses of the ENTER key to accept the changes.
<P>
If you know you will always be switching to a particular paper source, you
don't have to use the xSource variable. For example, the following command
will always switch to the Manual Feed paper source:
<P>
<PRE>   SendKeys "%fu%o%sm~~"

</PRE>For information on using SEND.KEYS with earlier versions of Microsoft
Excel, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
