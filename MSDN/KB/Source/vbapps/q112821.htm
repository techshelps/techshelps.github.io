The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 5.0, when you print multiple copies of a document, you
cannot automatically collate the pages unless the printer driver supports
collation.
<P>
NOTE: In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, a document can be collated
when you print it (regardless of whether the printer driver supports
collated printing).
<P>
This functionality was added in Microsoft Excel 7.0.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This method of printing is by design to allow for faster printing.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 5.0, to print collated copies of a file, do any of the
following:

<UL><LI>Print the document to a file on your hard drive and copy the file
   to the printer multiple times from the MS-DOS prompt.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Write a macro to print the selected file multiple times. Note that
   this option will be very time consuming because Microsoft Excel has
   to print single copies of the file multiple times. It is much
   faster to print a file multiple times. (Sample code is provided below.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If your printer driver provides the option to print collated copies,
   use this option. You can set this option by choosing the Print command
   on the File menu and then choosing Printer Setup in Microsoft Excel
   to access the printer driver settings.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An example of collated printing is when you print two copies of a file such
that page 1 and page 2 of the first copy are printed, and then page 1 and
page 2 of the second copy are printed. In contrast, uncollated printing
would print page 1, and then another page 1, and then page 2, and then
another page 2.
<P>
To print from the DOS prompt try the following command:
<P>
<PRE>    copy filename lpt1:/b

</PRE>where "filename" is the name of your file with its three character
extension and lpt1 is the port where your printer is connected. The "/b"
stands for binary.
<P>
<P>
Printer drivers that have a Copies box in the Print dialog box may support
collation. For example, most UNIDRV-based drivers support collation; some
printer drivers, such as the Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet, do not.
<P>
<P><h2>SAMPLE VISUAL BASIC FOR APPLICATIONS CODE</h2>
 
<P>
The following Visual Basic for Applications code allows you to print
multiple copies.
<P>
<PRE>'A procedure to print multiple copies
Sub Example()
   Ncopies = Application.InputBox _
   ("Please enter number of copies to print: ", _
    "Print Multiple Copies", 1, , , , , 1)
   For counter = 1 To Ncopies
      ActiveWindow.SelectedSheets.PrintOut Copies:=1
   Next
End Sub
