<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When your Visual Basic for Applications macro creates an object variable
that is set to reference a picture object, and if your macro later anchors
a hyperlink to the picture object, the object reference is deleted and you
receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '5825': Object has been deleted.

</PRE>For example, the following Visual Basic for Applications macro adds a
hyperlink to an already linked picture. The hyperlink is "anchored" to
the picture object referenced by the InLine Picture object variable oILPic.
Once the hyperlink is added, the object variable reference, oILPic, is
deleted.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub DoInLineShapeHyperlink()
      Dim oDoc As Document
      Dim oILPic As InlineShape
      Dim oHLink As Hyperlink
      Dim sPicFile As String
      Dim sLinkFile as String
      sPicFile = "&lt;Your Graphic File Path and Name&gt;"
      sLinkFile = "&lt;Your HyperLink File Path and Name&gt;"
      ' Create new document.
      Set oDoc = Documents.Add
      ' Insert a picture.
      Set oILPic = oDoc.InlineShapes.AddPicture _
         (Range:=oDoc.Content, FileName:=sPicFile, LinkToFile:=True)
      ' Add a hyperlink for the picture.
      oDoc.Hyperlinks.Add Anchor:=oILPic.Range, Address:=sLinkFile
      ' The error occurs here because oILPic is no longer valid.
      Set oHLink = oILPic.Hyperlink
   End Sub '

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You receive the "Object has been deleted" error message because the macro
has attempted to access an object that has been deleted. The object
may have been deleted deliberately, such as with the Delete method. Or, it
may have been deleted as a side effect of another operation, such as when a
frame is added around an inline shape, When adding a frame around an inline 
shape, the original inline shape is deleted and a copy of the shape is created 
inside the frame.
<P>

</PRE>To work around this problem, reference the object directly, as in the
following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub DoInLineShapeHyperlink()
      Dim oDoc As Document
      Dim oILPic As InlineShape
      Dim oHLink As Hyperlink
      Dim sPicFile As String
      Dim sLinkFile as String
      sPicFile = "&lt;Your Graphic File Path and Name&gt;"
      sLinkFile = "&lt;Your HyperLink File Path and Name&gt;"
      ' Create new document.
      Set oDoc = Documents.Add
      ' Insert a picture.
      Set oILPic = oDoc.InlineShapes.AddPicture _
      (Range:=oDoc.Content, FileName:= sPicFile, LinkToFile:=True)
      ' Add a hyperlink for the picture.
      oDoc.Hyperlinks.Add Anchor:=oILPic.Range, Address:=sLinkFile 
      ' Use the InlineShapes Property to reference the object.
      Set oHLink = oDoc.InlineShapes(1).Hyperlink
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the IsObjectValid method to verify that an object still exists.
The following example demonstrates the use of this method:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub testObject()
      Dim ilShp As InlineShape
      Set ilShp = ActiveDocument.InlineShapes.Add("C:\Windows\bubbles.bmp")
      MsgBox IsObjectValid(ilShp)     ' This will display True.
      a.Delete
      MsgBox IsObjectValid(ilShp)     ' This will display False.
   End Sub
