<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Microsoft Excel 97 Web Form Wizard to create a form for
gathering data over the Internet or an intranet, and you select the
"Microsoft Internet Information Server with the Internet Database
Connector" option in Step 3 of the Wizard, a Visual Basic for Applications
module, called WebForm_Submit, is added to the workbook form created by
the Wizard. This article provides the macro code created by the Wizard,
and some information on the Auto_Open macro in the module that can be
edited.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
If you create a form using the Web Form Wizard, the following macros are
added to a module that is included with the form.

<PRE>' If you remove the comment markers from the following code, only the
' cells that you specified as input cells in the Web Form Wizard will be

<P>
NOTE: The Auto_Open sub procedure that is commented-out, by default, can
be uncommented to change the protection of your form. If you uncomment
this procedure and then save and close the workbook, the next time you
open the workbook (either manually or through your browser) you will only
be able to select the cells you specified for data input when the form was
created with the Web Form Wizard. This is because the cells for data input
are not locked and the macro turns on worksheet protection with the
EnableSelection property for the worksheet set to xlUnlockedCells.
