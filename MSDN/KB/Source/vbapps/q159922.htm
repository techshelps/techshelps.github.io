The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Quit method in a Visual Basic for Applications macro to
quit Microsoft Excel 97, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at
   014f:3002dbae.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are controlling Microsoft Excel 97 through Automation from another
   program such as Microsoft Word 97, Microsoft Access 97, or Microsoft
   Visual Basic.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>In the macro, you set an object variable to refer to a worksheet in
   Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You dimension the object variable that refers to a worksheet at the
   module level instead of the procedure level. (The "Dim" line is not
   contained in the actual subroutine.)
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You do not release the object variable (by setting it equal to
   Nothing in the macro) before you quit Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, set object variables that refer
to Microsoft Excel worksheet objects to Nothing before you quit Microsoft
Excel 97. For example, use the following lines of code:
<P>
<PRE>   Set xSheet = Nothing
   xlApp.Quit

</PRE>Alternatively, dimension the object variables in the procedures in which
they are used. For example, if you create a Test procedure that uses the
xSheet variable, use the following lines of code:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()

       Dim xSheet As Object
       '&lt;Code that uses xSheet&gt;

   End Sub

</PRE>instead of the following lines of code:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim xSheet As Object

   Sub Test()

       '&lt;Code that uses xSheet&gt;

   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following example subroutine demonstrates when this problem may occur:
<P>
<PRE>   'Dimension the object variable outside of the subroutine that uses it.
   Dim xSheet As Object

   Sub MakeXLCrash()

       'Create an instance of Microsoft Excel 97.
       Set xlApp = CreateObject("Excel.Application.8")

       'Make the instance of Microsoft Excel 97 visible.
       xlApp.Visible = True

       'Create a new workbook. Set object variables equal to the workbook
       'and to a sheet in the workbook.
       Set xWorkbook = xlApp.Workbooks.Add
       Set xSheet = xWorkbook.ActiveSheet

       'Quit the instance of Microsoft Excel 97.
       xlApp.Quit

   End Sub

</PRE>If you type this code in a Visual Basic module in another program (for
example, Microsoft Word 97), and then run the macro, Microsoft Excel 97
will stop responding (crash) when the macro executes the Quit. This occurs
because the macro has not released object variable xSheet.
