<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
There may be times when you would like to animate the movements of the
Office Assistant in response to actions performed in your application. For
instance, you may want to have the Assistant appear when you open a
particular form. Or you may want the Assistant to react when a certain
event is triggered. This article shows you how to do so.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to the "Building
Applications with Microsoft Access 97" manual.
<P>
NOTE: A demonstration of the techniques used in this article can be seen
in the sample file, FrmSmp97.exe. For information about how to obtain
this sample file, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : ACC97: Microsoft Access 97 Sample Forms Available on MSL

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following example creates three event procedures that control the
behavior of the Clippit Assistant. The first procedure selects
Clippit and makes the Assistant visible when the Employees form is
opened. The second procedure instructs Clippit to simulate listening
to the computer when a field is updated. The third procedure closes the
Assistant when the form is closed and resets some of the properties of the
Assistant.
<P>
CAUTION: Following the steps in this example will modify the sample
database Northwind.mdb. You may want to back up the Northwind.mdb file
and perform these steps on a copy of the database.
<P>
NOTE: This example assumes you have the Clippit Assistant (Clippit.act)
installed on your computer. By default the Assistants are installed in
the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Actors\ folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Starting the Assistant</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Open the Employees form in Design view.

<P><LI>Set the OnOpen property of the form to the following event procedure.
<P>
   NOTE: The following sample code requires that you have a reference to
   the Microsoft Office 8.0 Object Library in your database. To create the
   reference, open any module in Design view, click References on the
   Tools menu, and then click the Microsoft Office 8.0 Object Library.

<PRE></PRE>         If Assistant.Visible = True Then
            With Assistant
               .AssistWithHelp = False
               .SearchWhenProgramming = False
               .GuessHelp = False
               .FeatureTips = False
               .Visible = False
            End With
         End If
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Close the Module window.

<P><LI>Save the form, and then open it in Form view. Note that the Powerpup
