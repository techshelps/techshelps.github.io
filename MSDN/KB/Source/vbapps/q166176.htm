</UL><h2>SYSTEM REQUIRMENTS</h2>
 
<P>
The Main Street Market Demo requires that you have the following
components installed and running correctly:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft PowerPoint 97
   Microsoft Jet Database Engine Version 3.5

</PRE>Both of these components are provided with Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
Use the following steps to verify that the Microsoft Jet Database Engine
is installed:

<OL><P><LI>In Windows Explorer, open the c:\Program Files folder.

<P><LI>Open the Microsoft Shared folder.

<P><LI>If you see a folder called DAO, then you probably have the Microsoft
   Jet Engine installed.
<P>
   NOTE: If you do not see the DAO folder, install Microsoft Jet
   to run this demo. For more information on installing a single
   component, please see the following article in the Microsoft

</PRE></OL><h2>ABOUT THE MAIN STREET MARKET DEMO</h2>
 
<P>
The Main Street Market Demo demonstrates some of the capabilities of
PowerPoint 97 and Visual Basic for Applications. Much of the
functionality of the presentation is archived through Visual Basic for
Applications macro code.
<P>
The Main Street Market Demo creates slides "on the fly" based on choices
you make during the presentation. For example, at the beginning of the
presentation you are asked to enter your name. From that point, dialogs
and certain slides are modified to reflect your name. This technique
allows you to personalize and customize the viewing experience.
<P>
The Demo creates a catalog of products sold by the fictitious company,
Main Street Market. The catalog is created during run-time based on
information in an Access database. You can modify the database to
include different products. For more information, please see "The
Catalog Database (Items.mdb)" section of this article.
<P>
In the presentation, you can mark items you want to purchase. The items
are added to your shopping cart. You can remove or delete items from the
shopping cart. You can also view the contents of the shopping cart as
long as the shopping cart contains at least one item. And, finally, you
can purchase the items in the shopping cart.
<P>
<P><h2>HOW TO USE THE MAIN STREET MARKET DEMO</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Getting Started</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Locate the Demo.pps file on your hard disk.

<P><LI>Double-click the Demo.pps file.
<P>
   Because the file has a .pps extension, PowerPoint will
   automatically start the presentation in Slide Show mode.
   The first slide you see is the Main Street Market logo.

<P><LI>To run the slide show, click anywhere on this slide.

<P><LI>Type your name in the Name box, and then press ENTER.
<P>
   A slide appears asking you if the name you typed is correct.
   Click Yes to advance to the next slide. Click No to return to the
   previous slide.
<P>
</OL><h3>Welcome Slide</h3>
 
<P>
From the Welcome slide you can view one of three catalogs: clothing,
electronics, and hardware. To select the catalog, click the name or the
circle to the left of the catalog you want to view. You can select
multiple catalogs. When you select a catalog a check mark appears in the
circle to the left of the catalog name. When you have selected the
catalogs you want to view, click Next.
<P>
The presentation creates the catalog using information that is stored
in an Access database (.mdb) file.
<P>
NOTE: The first time you create a catalog, it may take a moment.
However, the next time you create a catalog, within the same slide show,
the catalog will be created more quickly.
<P>
<P><h3>Catalog Slides</h3>
 
<P>
The catalog slides show one product at a time. One slide is displayed
for each item in the catalog.
<P>
The following options are available when you view a product:
<P>
<PRE>Add To Cart    Adds the current product to your shopping cart.

View Cart      Displays the contents of the shopping cart, as long as
               there is at least one item in the shopping cart.

Previous       Goes back to the previous product in the catalog.

Next           Goes to the next product in the catalog.

Start Over     Rebuilds the product catalog.

</PRE></OL><h3>Shopping Chart</h3>
 
<P>
The Shopping Cart slide displays the items you selected from the
catalog. To view the Shopping Cart slide, click the View Cart icon that
appears on any catalog slide. You can make the following selections on
the Shopping Cart slide:
<P>
<PRE>Remove Item     Removes the item from the shopping cart and updates the
                list of products.

Previous        Returns you to the catalog slide where you clicked
                View Cart.

Buy Now!        Purchases the items currently held in your shopping
                cart and then returns you to the Main Street Market
                splash screen.

Start Over      Rebuilds the product catalog.

</PRE><h3>Exiting the Demo</h3>
 
<P>
To exit the Main Street Market presentation at any time, press ESC.
If you receive a message asking if you want to save changes to Demo.pps,
click No. This message is displayed because you are adding slides to the
slide show during run-time. You do not need to save these changes.
<P>

</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Microsoft PowerPoint Objects
         ----------------------------

            Slide2
            Slide3
            Slide5
            SlideMaster

         Modules
         -------

            ButtonCode
            DaoCode
            InitSlideCode
            ShoppingCart
            Tools

   b. Expand the Modules folder.

   c. Double-click the ShoppingCart module.

      The code for the Shopping Cart module is displayed in the code
      window.

</PRE></OL><h2>THE CATALOG DATABASE (ITEMS.MDB)</h2>
 
<P>
The catalog is contained in an Access 97 database (.mdb) file. You can
edit the Items.mdb file in Access 97 if you want to modify the images,
descriptions, or prices that are displayed when you run the Main Street
Market demo:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access 97.

<P><LI>Open the Items.mdb file.

<P><LI>Click the Tables tab.

<P><LI>Open the InventoryList table.

<P><LI>Make the changes you want to the table.
<P>
   The following table identifies the fields used in the InventoryList
   table in the Items.mdb database. You can add or delete items from
   any of these categories:
<P>
<PRE>   Product Name     Stores the name of the product.

   Description      Holds the description of the product.

   Price            Holds the price of the product.

   Shipping         Holds the shipping cost of the product.

   Picture          Holds the path to the graphic that you want to use
                    to represent the product.

                    NOTE: The graphic must be in a format for which
                    PowerPoint has a graphic filter. You can use a
                    relative path to the graphic or place the graphic
                    in the same directory as the presentation.

   Category         Defines the catalog name, such as Hardware,
                    Clothing, or Electronics.

                    NOTE: If you want to define a new catalog, you must
                    also modify the Visual Basic code.

   Layout           Specifies the layout for the catalog slides. This
                    value should be 13.

                    NOTE: If you want to use a different layout, you
                    must modify the Visual Basic code.

</PRE><P><LI>Click Save on the File menu.
<P>
</OL><h2>KNOWN ISSUES</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a list of the known issues with the Main Street Market
demo.

<UL><LI>If you specify an invalid path to a graphic file in the Items.mdb
   file, the Main Street Market demo is unable to create a catalog.

<LI>When you exit from the demo, you receive a message asking if you want
   to save changes to the Demo.pps file. This occurs because the demo
   creates slides that are not part of the original Demo.pps file.
   Microsoft recommends that you do not save the changes to the file
   because this will increase the size of the Demo.pps file.

<LI>If you run Demo.pps from a server, you must have read, write, and
   create permissions to the server where the demo resides. If you do
   not, the demo cannot create the catalog.
<P>
