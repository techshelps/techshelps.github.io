The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the BuiltInDocumentProperties property and the
wdPropertyTitle constant in a macro to alter the title of a document, as
in the following example
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveDocument.BuiltInDocumentProperties(wdPropertyTitle) = "My Title"

</PRE>and you then save the document, you may not receive the results you
expect. Specifically, the name suggested in the Save As dialog box (in the
File Name box) will reflect a name other than the name in the Title box in
the Properties dialog box (on the File menu, click Properties).
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur if you manually change the value in the
Title box in the Properties dialog box. In this case, the Save As dialog
box suggests the title of the document for the file name.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the document you are working with is based on a
custom template that has a title.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use WordBasic commands instead of the BuiltInDocumentProperties property
to change and set the title of the new document, as in the following
example:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub Document_New()
      WordBasic.FileSummaryInfo Title:="New Document Title"
      WordBasic.SetDocumentProperty "Title", 0, "New Document Title"
   End Sub

<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a new document, Word checks to see if the document has a
title. If it does, Word will suggest that title for the file name. By
default, Word sets the title for a document equal to the title of the
template that the document is based on. So, if the template has a title,
Word uses that title for the suggested file name.
<P>
If you programmatically change the title of the new document, the change
will occur as expected in the Properties dialog box; however, when you
choose either Save or Save As (on the File Menu), Word continues to
suggest the title of the template.
