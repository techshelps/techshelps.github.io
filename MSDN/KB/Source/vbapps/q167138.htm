<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides general information about using Visual Basic
Scripting Edition (VBScript) with Microsoft Outlook 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the following topics:

<UL><LI>Overview
<LI>VBScript Version History
<LI>How to Determine Your Version of VBScript
<LI>How to Obtain VBScript Version 3.0 and Its Documentation
<LI>How to Debug VBScript Programming Code
<LI>Deploying VBScript with an Outlook Solution
<P>
</UL><h3>Overview</h3>
 
<P>
VBScript is the programming language that you use to create custom form
solutions with Outlook 97. Microsoft Internet Explorer also uses VBScript
to create custom HTML page solutions.
<P>
VBScript is a subset of the commands available in Microsoft Visual Basic
for Applications in Office 97, which in turn is a subset of the commands
available in Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0.
<P>
In Outlook, VBScript is stored within Outlook items, such as a contact,
mail message, or appointment. There is no global repository for VBScript
code in Outlook as there is with other Office applications. All
programming from within Outlook involves creating a custom form. You can
also automate Outlook from another Visual Basic or Microsoft Office
application by using the object model of Outlook; however, the object model
is heavily based on Outlook items and folders.
<P>
Outlook's implementation of VBScript is by design and there are no current
plans to implement Visual Basic for Applications within Outlook. VBScript
is Microsoft's programming environment for all "enterprise" (or
"distributed") solutions, mainly for two reasons:

<UL><LI>Because VBScript code is interpreted and not compiled, Outlook items
   are relatively small (in terms of bytes). This means they consume less
   corporate and Internet server resources and also result in faster
   performance.

<LI>VBScript is designed to be a secure programming environment. It
   lacks various commands that can be potentially damaging if used in a
   malicious manner. This added security is critical in enterprise
   solutions.
<P>
</UL><h3>VBScript Version History</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Version   Availability                 Notes
   -------   --------------------------   ---------------------------------
   1.0       Included with Outlook
             versions 8.0 - 8.02

   2.0       No longer available for      The self-installing executable
             Download. Included with      filename was Scr20en.exe. Added
             with Internet Information    features included arrays, the
             Server (IIS) 2.0.            For Each...Next structure, and
                                          GetObject/CreateObject commands.

   3.0       Installed by Internet        See the following Web site for
             Explorer 4.0                 all current information:
                                          <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/vbscript">http://www.microsoft.com/vbscript</A></B>
   3.1       Installed by Internet
             Explorer 4.1

   3.1a      Download only                <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/vbscript">http://www.microsoft.com/vbscript</A></B>

</PRE><h3>How to Determine Your Version of VBScript</h3>
 
<P>
To determine which version of VBScript you have, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows taskbar, click the Start button, point to Find, and then
   click Files Or Folders.

<P><LI>In the Named box, type "vbscript.dll" (without the quotation marks), and
   then click Find Now.

<P><LI>Using the right mouse button, click the Vbscript.dll file name in
   the Name list, and on the shortcut menu, click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Version tab and note the "File version" information.
<P>
<PRE>    VBScript   DLL version   File Date   File Size
    ---------------------------------------------------
    1.0        1.0.0.806     (varies)    206,848 bytes
    2.0        2.0.0.1125    (varies)    252,232 bytes
    3.0        3.0.0.2026    9/18/97     327,952 bytes
    3.1        3.1.0.2124    11/18/97    328,976 bytes
    3.1a       3.1.0.2430    12/30/97    328,976 bytes

</PRE></OL><h3>How to Obtain VBScript 3.x and Its Documentation</h3>
 
<P>
VBScript 3.x is installed as part of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x, which
is available from the Microsoft Web site at the following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/download">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/download</A></B>

</PRE>Documentation for VBScript 3.x is available from the following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/vbscript">http://www.microsoft.com/vbscript</A></B>

</PRE>NOTE: Because the Microsoft Web site is constantly updated, the site
address may change without notice. If this occurs, link to the Microsoft
home page at the following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</A></B>

</PRE><h3>How to Debug VBScript Programming Code</h3>
 
<P>
Outlook 97 provides no built-in debugging tools for troubleshooting
programming problems. However, you can get debugging functionality by using
the VBScript debugger which is commonly used with Internet Explorer.
<P>
Free, unsupported beta versions of debuggers are available on the
Microsoft Web site at the following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/scripting/debugger">http://www.microsoft.com/scripting/debugger</A></B>

</PRE>For VBScript version 1.0 or 2.0, use the debugger for Internet Explorer
3.x. For VBScript versions 3.x, use the debugger for Internet Explorer 4.0.
<P>
To access the debugger from Outlook, place a Stop statement in your
VBScript code. When the VBScript code runs and reaches the Stop statement,
the debugger starts, and you can then step through your code in the
debugger or use the debugger's Immediate or Command window to view the
contents of variables ("? &lt;Variablename&gt;" is the syntax). Note that you
cannot edit the VBScript code within the debugger.
<P>
<P><h3>Deploying VBScript with an Outlook Solution</h3>
 
<P>
If an Outlook solution uses any commands specific to VBScript version 2.0
or 3.x, you must install the updated version of VBScript on all of the
computers that will use the solution.
<P>
Outlook primarily uses Vbscript.dll, but the complete set of scripting DLLs
also include Jscript.dll, and Scrrun.dll.
