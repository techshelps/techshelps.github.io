<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office 97 contains Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers that
you can use to access data from other programs. This article describes the
different types of data source names (DSN) that you can install and use in
Microsoft Office 97 programs, specifically in Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office, an ODBC icon, which represents the ODBC
Manager, is installed in the Microsoft Windows Control Panel. The ODBC
Manager allows you to set up and configure ODBC data sources. In the ODBC
Manager, you can set up and configure the following three types of DSNs:
<P>
<PRE>   User DSN
   System DSN
   File DSN

</PRE><h3>User DSN</h3>
 
<P>
The User DSN is a data source that is user specific. A User DSN is stored
locally but is available only to the user who creates it. User DSNs are not
used by Microsoft Query 97. If you use Microsoft Jet, ODBC, or Structured
Query Language (SQL) commands and bypass Microsoft Query, User DSNs are
required. User DSNs are stored in the Windows registry under the following
key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Odbc\Odbc.ini\Odbc Data sources

</PRE><h3>System DSN</h3>
 
<P>
Unlike a User DSN, a System DSN is not user specific. A System DSN is
stored locally and is not dedicated to a particular user. Any user who logs
on to a computer that has permission to access the data source can use a
System DSN. Some programs, such as Microsoft SQL Server or Microsoft
Internet Information Server (IIS), require a System DSN. This DSN must be
created on the server where the program is located. System DSNs are stored
in the Windows registry under the following key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Odbc\Odbc.ini\Odbc Data sources

</PRE><h3>File DSN</h3>
 
<P>
The File DSN is created locally and may be shared with other users. The
File DSN is file based, which means that the .dsn file contains all the
information required to connect to the data source. Note that you must
install the ODBC driver locally to use a File DSN. Microsoft Query uses
File DSNs but Microsoft Jet and ODBC do not use File DSNs.
<P>
The File DSNs are stored by default in the Program Files\Common
Files\Odbc\Data Sources folder. File DSNs are not stored in the Windows
registry. The .dsn file is a text file that you can view in any text
editor, such as Microsoft Notepad.
<P>
NOTE: When you connect to an existing data source using Microsoft Query,
only the available File DSNs that are stored on that computer are
displayed. Microsoft Query does not display User or System DSNs. However,
you can create a File DSN that points to a System DSN.
<P>
To create a File DSN that points to a System DSN, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In a text editor, such a Notepad, type the following two lines in a new
   document
<P>
<P><PRE>      [ODBC]
      DSN=&lt;MySysDSN&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;MySysDSN&gt; is the name of an existing System DSN that you
   installed in the ODBC icon in the Control Panel.

<P><LI>Click Save on the File menu and type a name that includes a .dsn file
   name extension for the File DSN; for example, "DBase4.dsn" is a valid
   name. Include the quotation marks to ensure that the .dsn file name
   extension is added correctly.
<P>
</OL>You can also share a File DSN with other users. To do this, share the
folder in which the .dsn file is stored using the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Under Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, right-click
   the Start menu and click Explore.

<P><LI>Open the folder that contains the .dsn files. By default, this is the
   Program Files\Common Files\Odbc\Data Sources folder.

<P><LI>Right-click the folder and click Sharing. On the Sharing tab, click
   Shared As and type the name to use for the folder in the Share Name
   box. Click OK.
<P>
</OL>Note: Each user must install the appropriate ODBC driver (the driver that
the File DSN refers to) on the computer in order for the File DSN to
function properly.

<P><h3>Sample Macro to Return External Data to Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
The following Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications macro can use
an existing User or System DSN to retrieve data from a database and store
the data in a worksheet. The sample DSN that is used in this macro is
MyDSN. It references the Microsoft Access 97 sample database Northwind.mdb
in the Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples folder. You can use
MyDSN as a User or System DSN but you cannot use it as a File DSN.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Get_Data()
   
       'Define SQL query string to get the CategoryName field from
       'the Category table.
       sqlstring = "SELECT CategoryName FROM Categories"
   
       'Define connection string and reference File DSN.
       connstring = "ODBC;DSN=MyDSN"
   
       'Create QueryTable in worksheet beginning with cell C1.
       With ActiveSheet.QueryTables.Add(Connection:=connstring, _
           Destination:=Range("C1"), Sql:=sqlstring)
           .Refresh
       End With
   
   End Sub

type "data sources", click Search, and then click to view "Ways to retrieve
data from an external database."
