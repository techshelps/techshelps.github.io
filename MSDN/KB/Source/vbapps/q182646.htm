The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro in Microsoft Excel 98
Macintosh Edition, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':
   You cannot change part of an array.

</PRE>Or, when you manually paste a copied cell in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh
Ediiton, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   You cannot change part of an array.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This will occur if you copy (either manually or through a macro) a cell
that contains an array formula and then attempt to paste the copied formula
into a range of cells that also includes the original cell. For example,
you copy cell A1 and then attempt to paste it to cells A1 through A10.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you manually copy and paste a formula that is part of an array, use the
following steps to copy and paste the formula without receiving an error
message:

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell that contains the array formula (for example, cell A1).

<P><LI>Press COMMAND+U, and then press RETURN.
<P>
   If you receive the error message "You cannot change part of an array"
   this array formula is entered into multiple cells. Click OK.

<P><LI>Select the range of cells, including the original cell, into which
   the array formula should be entered (for example A1:A10). Make sure
   that the cell that contains the formula is the active cell.

<P><LI>Press COMMAND+U, and then press COMMAND+RETURN.
<P>
</OL>The array formula is now entered into the entire range of cells.

<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/</A></B>

</PRE></OL>To prevent this problem from occurring when you copy and paste the formula
with a macro, you should perform the following steps in your macro:

<OL><P><LI>Read the array formula from the original cell, and store the formula
   in a variable.

<P><LI>Clear the original cell.

<P><LI>Apply the stored formula to all of the cells in the range, including
   the original cell.
<P>
</OL>The following sample macro demonstrates how to do this. In this example,
cell A1 contains the array formula "=SUM(IF(B1:B100=0,1,0))", (without
quotation marks). The macro applies this formula to the range A1:A10.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub CopyArrayFormula1()
       'stores formula in variable
       xFormula = Range("A1").Formula
       'clears formula from cell
       Range("A1").Clear
       'applies formula
       Range("A1:A10").FormulaArray = xFormula
   End Sub

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, array formulas are a special type of formula that allow
you to perform a large number of calculations in a single cell. When you
want to enter a formula as an array formula, instead of just pressing
RETURN, you press COMMAND+RETURN.
<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, it is possible for you or a Visual
Basic macro to paste a copied array formula in a range of cells that
includes the original copied cell.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, this will not work unless you
first clear the original cell, or convert it into a normal formula. This
behavior is actually correct: the behavior of earlier versions of Microsoft
Excel is incorrect.
