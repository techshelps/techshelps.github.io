The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you run a Visual Basic macro that uses a line of
code similar to the following to delete all of the chart sheets in a
workbook
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveWorkbook.Charts.Delete

</PRE>Microsoft Excel may delete one or more worksheets, including the active
worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if the workbook does not contain any chart sheets.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without 
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the 
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular 
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming 
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug 
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality 
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to 
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific 
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact 
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more 
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see 
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>To prevent this problem from occurring, modify the macro so that it checks
for the existence of chart sheets in the workbook before it removes all of
the chart sheets. For example, use the following code:
<P>
<PRE>   If ActiveWorkbook.Charts.Count &gt; 0 Then
       ActiveWorkbook.Charts.Delete
   End If

</PRE>If there are one or more chart sheets in the workbook, they are deleted. If
there are no chart sheets in the workbook, the command to delete the chart
sheets is not executed. This prevents the macro from deleting any of the
worksheets.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that this problem does not occur in earlier versions of Microsoft
Excel. In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, if the workbook does not
contain any chart sheets, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':
   Delete method of Sheets class failed

</PRE>Also, note that charts that are embedded in worksheets do not count as
chart sheets. If the workbook contains embedded charts but not chart
sheets, the Charts.Delete command removes one or more worksheets from
the workbook.
