<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Project, if you use the AppExecute method in a macro to
start an application, you may receive the following error message
when you run the macro
<P>
<PRE>   System Error

   Cannot read from drive &lt;n&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;n&gt; is the first letter in the name of the application that you
are trying to run.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if the command argument of the AppExecute method
begins with a capital letter, and the capital letter is not a drive
letter in a path to the application. For example, if you use the
command argument "Analyzer.exe", (a valid command if the Analyzer
application is located in a directory that is contained in the path
statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file), you receive a system error
indicating that the system cannot read from drive A.
<P>
This behavior occurs because the AppExecute method assumes that if the
first character in the command argument is capitalized, the character is a
drive letter. Therefore, it incorrectly tries to locate the application on
this drive.
<P>
Note that if there is a disk in the drive that the AppExecute method
is searching, you do not receive a system error. In this case, the
drive is accessed, and the application starts as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem when you use the AppExecute method, use
all lowercase letters in a command argument that does not contain a
path to the application. For example, if you are using the AppExecute
method to run the Analyzer application that is shipped with Microsoft
Project, use the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub RunApp()
      AppExecute "analyzer.exe"
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft
products listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the AppExecute method in a macro to run an application.
The command argument of the AppExecute method is a string expression
that specifies the command to start the application. However, if the
command argument that you use begins with a capital letter, and this
letter is not used to specify the drive letter in the path to the
application, you may receive a system error as described above.
