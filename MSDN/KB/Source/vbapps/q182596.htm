a Visual Basic for Applications macro that uses Data Access Objects (DAO)
is available. When this problem occurs, the following error message
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '40009':
   No current row.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This Dao350.dll file is the same file that is included with Microsoft Excel
97. The version and date of the file have been changed to prevent Microsoft
Visual Basic version 5.0 from replacing Dao350.dll with a newer version
that is not fully compatible with Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
After you install this revised file, you can install Microsoft Visual Basic
or custom Visual Basic applications without having to manually replace the
Dao350.dll file that is included with Microsoft Excel 97 after each
installation. To see the contents of the Readme file that is included with
the revised Dao350.dll file, see the "Contents of the Readme File" section.
<P>
NOTE: This revised file does not resolve the problem if the recordset
contains a field of type BIGINT.
<P>
<P><h3>Contents of the Readme File</h3>
 
<P>
The revised Dao350.dll file that is included in the Newdao.exe
file corrects a problem that prevents you from running Visual Basic(R)
for Applications macros that use Data Access Objects (DAO). Without
this revised Da0350.dll, the macro may fail and you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '40009':
   No current row.

</PRE>NOTE: This is the same Dao350.dll that is included with Microsoft
Excel 97 for Windows(R). The version and date of Dao350.dll have been
changed to prevent Microsoft Visual Basic version 5.0 (or a Visual
Basic application that uses DAO) from replacing it with a version of
the file that has a later date but that is not fully compatible with
Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
To correct the problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Close all programs.

<P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Find, and click Files Or Folders.

<P><LI>In the Named box, type "Dao350.dll" (without the quotation marks).
   In the Look In box, select "(C:)" (or the hard disk drive
   in which Microsoft Windows is located). Click to select the
   Include Subfolders check box, and then click Find Now.
<P>
   One copy of the original Dao350.dll should be in the following
   folder
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;WinDrv&gt;\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Dao
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;WinDrv&gt; is the disk drive letter for the hard disk on
   which Windows is installed.

<P><LI>Right-click each Dao350.dll file. On the shortcut menu, click
   Rename. Change the name of the file to "Dao350.vb5" (without
   the quotation marks). Press ENTER.
<P>
   These files are backup copies of the existing Dao350.dll files.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft(R) Windows Explorer and open the following folder
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;WinDrv&gt;\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Dao
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;WinDrv&gt; is the disk drive letter for the hard disk
   on which Windows is installed.

<P><LI>Copy the downloaded Dao350.dll into the folder you opened in
   step 5.
<P>
</OL>You can now safely install Microsoft Visual Basic version 5.0 (or
Microsoft Visual Basic applications that use DAO) without affecting
DAO in Visual Basic for Applications.
