<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, there are two ways of populating a ComboBox or ListBox 
control. You can link the control to worksheet cells or you can populate 
the control with a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without

implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular 
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming 
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug 
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality 
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to 
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific 
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact 
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more 
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see 
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>You can use a control, such as a combo box or a list box, on a worksheet or
on a UserForm. The methods for populating the controls are similar. The
examples in this article use controls on a UserForm.
<P>
<P><h3>Linking a Combo Box or List Box to Cells on a Worksheet</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new workbook in Microsoft Excel. On Sheet1, type the following:
<P>
<PRE>      A1: One     B1: Red
      A2: Two     B2: Green
      A3: Three   B3: Yellow
      A4: Four    B4: Blue

</PRE><P><LI>Press ALT+F11 to start the Microsoft Excel Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click UserForm.

<P><LI>Create a ComboBox and a ListBox control on the UserForm.

<P><LI>If the Properties window is not visible, click Properties Window on
   the View menu.

<P><LI>Click the ComboBox and scroll to RowSource in the Properties window.
<P>
</OL>The window is divided into two sections. The left section contains the
name of the property for the control. The right section contains the
value of the property. Click in the right section of RowSource and type
"sheet1!a1:a4" (without the quotation marks).

<OL><P><LI>Click the ListBox and scroll to RowSource in the Properties window.
   Click in the right section of RowSource and type "sheet1!b1:b4"
   (without the quotation marks).
<P>
   NOTE: If you omit the sheet reference, the ComboBox and ListBox controls
   are populated with the data from the cells from the worksheet that is
   active when you run the UserForm. To ensure that the data from the same
   worksheet is always used to populate the UserForm, include the sheet
   reference as shown in the examples. To populate the UserForm with data
   from the active sheet, do not include the sheet reference in the
   RowSource. When you do this, the macro uses data from the active sheet
   to populate the UserForm.

<P><LI>Run the UserForm by clicking Run, and then clicking Run Sub/UserForm.
<P>
</OL>One, Two, Three, and Four appear in the ComboBox control; and Red, Green, 
Yellow, and Blue appear in the ListBox control.
<P>
<P><h3>Using a Visual Basic Macro to Populate a Combo Box or List Box</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new workbook in Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Press ALT+F11 to start the Microsoft Excel Visual Basic Editor.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click UserForm.

<P><LI>Create a ComboBox and a ListBox control on the UserForm.

<P><LI>Right-click the UserForm and click View Code. The Code window for the
   UserForm appears. Click Initialize in the Procedure list (on the
   right side).
<P>
   The first and last lines of the subroutine are automatically entered,
   and the insertion point is automatically placed between these two lines.

<P><LI>Type the following code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      myarray1 = Array("One", "Two", "Three", "Four")
      myarray2 = Array("Red", "Green", "Yellow", "Blue")
      For x = 0 to 3
<PRE></PRE>          ListBox1.AddItem myarray1(x)
      Next x
      For y = 0 to 3
          ComboBox1.AddItem myarray2(y)
      Next y

   This code should appear between the lines "Sub UserForm_Initialize()"
   and "End Sub".

</PRE><P><LI>On the Run menu, click Run Sub/UserForm to run the UserForm.

<P><LI>One, Two, Three, and Four appear in the ListBox control; and Red, Green, 
   Yellow, and Blue appear in the ComboBox control.
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about UserForms, click the Index tab in Microsoft
Visual Basic Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   UserForm Object

</PRE></OL>and then double-click the selected text to go to the "UserForm Object"
topic.
