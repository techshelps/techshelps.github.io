<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro that attempts to
ungroup a range of objects, you may receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Run time error '424': Object required

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs because there are no objects selected to ungroup.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Add .Select to the group and ungroup the commands, as in the following
example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub UnGroupShapes()
      Dim oshape1 As Object
      Dim oshape2 As Object
      'Create new blank document.
      Application.Documents.Add
      'Create two shapes(Hexagon and Heart).
      Set oshape1 = ActiveDocument.Shapes.AddShape _
      (10, 122.4, 79.2, 72#, 72#)
      Set oshape2 = ActiveDocument.Shapes.AddShape _
      (21, 230.4, 79.2, 72#, 72#)
      'Select both shapes.
      oshape1.Select
      oshape2.Select (0)
      'Group the shapes.
      Selection.ShapeRange.Group.Select
      'UnGroup the shapes.
      Selection.ShapeRange.Ungroup.Select
   End Sub

</PRE>To have this code work properly you would either have to have the last two
lines look like this
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.ShapeRange.Group.Select
   Selection.ShapeRange.Ungroup

</PRE>to group the objects, reselect them, ungroup the objects and "unselect"
them; or, you could use
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.ShapeRange.Group.Select
   Selection.ShapeRange.Ungroup.Select

</PRE>to group the objects, select them, ungroup the objects and leave them
selected.
<P>
For more information about grouping and ungrouping shapes, click the Office
Assistant in the Visual Basic for Applications Editor, type "ShapeRange,"
click Search, and then click to view "ShapeRange Collection Object."
