The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Studio 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With Visual Studio 97 you get a vast and comprehensive visual tool set to
develop internet solutions and windows applications. In addition to
providing the tools needed for application development, Visual Studio also
provides a shared environment (IDE) for developing and debugging source
code written in Visual C++, Visual J++ or Visual InterDev. Visual Studio
also provides database support through Microsoft Visual FoxPro, and also
for Microsoft Access through Visual Basic and Visual C++. The Microsoft
Developer Network (MSDN) Library provides tool-specific documentation, as
well as comprehensive information. The Enterprise version also includes
Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, a common source-code tool that supports
projects written in any Visual Studio language, and also Microsoft SQL
Server.
<P>
Visual Studio requires a lot of disk space. An installation of all products
in Visual Studio is going to use more than 1 GBytes of hard disk space. The
simplest installation method is to install all components into the same
(large) hard drive. However, if you only have smaller drives, or have
several drives, each of which only has a few hundred megabyte free, then
you have to install some of the components onto separate drives.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two complementary problems with installing the components of
Visual Studio onto several drives:

<UL><LI>Visual Studio 97 master setup is not integrated, so you cannot see
   how much space will be required of each product until you go to the
   setup of that product.

<LI>Some components in several of the products must be installed into the
   same place (the "Shared Components" mentioned in the master setup
   welcome screen).
<P>
</UL>Several products (Visual C++, Visual J++, Visual InterDev, Visual Basic's
Data Tools) use the MSDEV IDE components. These components all must be
installed to the same place. Also, the IDE-based books online and MSDN
index files are installed here.
<P>
When you do a custom install of Visual C++, Visual J++, or Visual InterDev,
you are given a choice of where to install these shared components. Once
you install any product that installs some of the shared components, any
subsequent products you install will use the same directory when installing
additional shared components. Plan on using about 300 MBytes disk space for
the shared components. Expect to use more if you are going to install all
of the online books to the hard drive instead of using the CDROM. Expect to
use less if you are not loading any books onto the hard drive, or not
installing all of the products.
<P>
For these reasons, the following is a suggested method of installation:

<OL><P><LI>(ONLY USE THIS STEP FOR VERY UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SPACE IS
   EXTREMELY TIGHT)
<P>
   Start Visual Studio master setup and:
<P>
   a. Start the setup for each product you are interested in.
   b. Go to custom install for that product, select the components you
<P><PRE>      want, and check the size requirements for the non-shared components.
</PRE>   c. Exit the product setup without setting up, and return to Visual
<P><PRE>      Studio master setup.
</PRE>   d. This should help you plan where the various products can fit.

<P><LI>Decide on which drive to install all the shared components, and then
   decide on which drives to install the remaining non-shared components of
   each individual product. The back of the Visual Studio 97 box gives an
   idea of how much space the various products require, but this will
   depend on your choices and does not show how much is shared and how
   much is from non-shared components.

<P><LI>Start Visual Studio master setup and select one of the products you
   want to install, but start with one that includes shared components.
   For example, Visual C++, Visual J++, etc.

<P><LI>In this product's custom install, select the drive you want to use for
   the shared components.

<P><LI>In the custom install for this product and each of the remaining
   products you want, select the drive to use for the non-shared
   components.
<P>
</OL>There are 2 additional considerations for installation:

<OL><P><LI>If you are going to install SQL Server, do that first. There is a known
   issue in the SQL Server that can cause it to overwrite newer components
   with older components.

<P><LI>If you are going to install MSDN, install it last because this will
   often reduce the number of times you have to swap disks when searching
   or referencing the online documentation. If you always keep the MSDN
   CDROM in the drive, you do not have to disk swap for online content.
