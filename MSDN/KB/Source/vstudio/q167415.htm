The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Studio 97
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual J++, version 1.1
<LI>Microsoft Visual InterDev, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Under certain circumstances, the InfoViewer online help included with the
stand-alone MSDN or the Developer Studio IDE (MSDEV) displays the "Merging
Keywords..." window each time you use online documentation for the first
time after starting MSDN or Developer Studio. Normally, it should only need
to merge keywords if new online content has been installed since the last
time online books were used.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are four reasons why keywords will have to be merged more than once:

<UL><LI>New online books have just been installed or uninstalled.
<LI>The merge information is damaged or corrupted.
<LI>The registry information for InfoViewer is damaged or corrupted.
<LI>Admin privileges are required to save registry changes for the Keyword
   information
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you install or uninstall online books, MSDN or Developer Studio has to
merge keywords the next time you use online docs.
<P>
Some updates to the registry require Admin privileges. After you have
updated or installed online books, you need to have Admin privileges to
save the keyword state following "Merging keywords". If you do not have
Admin privileges, it will always merge keywords each time you do a search
after starting Developer Studio. So, each time you update the books online,
log on as an administrator the first time you search the online books. From
then on, you will not need Admin privileges when you use online
documentation.
<P>
The merged information is stored in a file with extension 'IVK' in the
..\DevStudio\SharedIDE\help directory. If this file is damaged, deleted, or
corrupted, online help has to merge keywords the next time you start the
books online. If it always merges keywords the first time, the IVK file may
be corrupted in a way that prevents it from being written correctly. The
best fix for this is to delete the IVK file and restart MSDEV.
<P>
If the registry entries for InfoViewer are corrupted, you may get "Title
Registration Error Unable to access xxx" when you start the IDE, where
<PRE>'xxx' is whatever InfoViewer title it could not find. When this happens,
</PRE>InfoViewer can't use the keyword information from your last online help
session. It has to merge keywords every time. The recommended way to fix
this is to delete the registry entry for InfoViewer. It is in
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/InfoViewer/5.0. Delete this key and
then reinstall all of the online docs you are interested in.
<P>
WARNING: Using the registry editor incorrectly can damage the installation
of your software and can even prevent proper functioning of the Windows
operating system software.
