<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Device Development Kit (DDK) for Windows NT,
   versions 3.5, 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT is designed around the concept that the first driver to claim a
device obtains ownership of that device. This ownership can be shared or it
can be exclusive; this is up to the claiming device driver. If the device
is exclusively claimed by a device driver, any further attempts to claim
the device by subsequently loaded device drivers fail. Because of this, it
is imperative that the order in which device drivers load can be modified
by device driver authors. This article describes the two methods that you
can use to control the order in which device drivers load.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two methods that you can use to control the order in which device
drivers load. Both methods take advantage of entries in the registry that
can be found at \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control. The
first method is to modify the ServiceGroupOrder. The second method is to
assign Tag values that determine the order of driver loading according to
the GroupOrderList.
<P>
These two methods only work for device drivers that have a start value of
0 (SERVICE_BOOT_START) or 1 (SERVICE_SYSTEM_START). In all cases, device
drivers with a start value of 0 load before any device drivers with a start
value of 1 attempt to load.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: ServiceGroupOrder</h3>
 
<P>
The ServiceGroupOrder contains a list of group names in the order that they
will be loaded. Here are the unmodified contents of ServiceGroupOrder:
<P>
<PRE>       SCSI miniport
       port
       Primary disk
       SCSI class
       SCSI CDROM class
       filter
       boot file system
       Base
       Pointer Port
       Keyboard Port
       Pointer Class
       Keyboard Class
       Video Init
       Video
       Video Save
       file system
       Event log
       Streams Drivers
       NDIS
       TDI
       NetBIOSGroup
       SpoolerGroup

</PRE>According to the ServiceGroupOrder, device drivers in the group "SCSI
class" load after all device drivers in the group "Primary disk" and before
device drivers in the group "SCSI CDROM class" load. The higher a device
driver's group is in the list, the sooner it loads. The ServiceGroupOrder
list is scanned twice. First, all device drivers with a start value of 0
load; then, all device drivers with a start value of 1 load. Thus, a device
driver with a start value of 0 loads before any device driver with a start
value of 1, no matter what its position on the ServiceGroupOrder list.
<P>
It is possible for the device driver author to edit the ServiceGroupOrder.
By doing this, a new group can be created at any place in the list. A good
example might be an SCSI class device driver called "SAMPLDRV" needing to
load before "SCSIDISK" because SCSIDISK is claiming a device that
SAMPLDRV needs to claim. Here is SCSIDISK's registry entries:
<P>
<PRE>       \registry\machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\scsidisk
          Type = REG_DWORD 0x00000001
          Start = REG_DWORD 0x00000000
          Group = SCSI class
          ErrorControl = REG_DWORD 0x00000000
          DependOnGroup = REG_MULTI_SZ "SCSI miniport"

</PRE>A new group can be added to the ServiceGroupOrder called "Load Me
First" and SAMPLDRV can have its group set to Load Me First. Here is
the modified ServiceGroupOrder:
<P>
<PRE>       SCSI miniport
       port
       Primary disk
       Load Me First
       SCSI class
       SCSI CDROM class
       filter
       boot file system
       .
       .
       .

</PRE>Here is SAMPLDRV's registry entries:
<P>
<PRE>       \registry\machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\sampldrv
          Type = REG_DWORD 0x00000001
          Start = REG_DWORD 0x00000000
          Group = Load Me First
          ErrorControl = REG_DWORD 0x00000000
          DependOnGroup = REG_MULTI_SZ "SCSI miniport"

</PRE>With this configuration, SAMPLDRV loads before SCSIDISK.
<P>
<P><h3>Method #2: GroupOrderList and Tag Values</h3>
 
<P>
An optional key called Tag can be included in a device driver's registry.
The value of the Tag helps determine the loading order of the device
drivers within a group. The loading order is not necessarily in numerical
order; rather, it is in the order defined by the GroupOrderList. The first
entry per group in the GroupOrderList is the number of Tag values. This is
followed by the numerical sequence in which the Tag values are to be
loaded. Device drivers in a group are first loaded according to their Tag
value as defined by the GroupOrderList. If the device driver does not have
a Tag value or if the Tag value is not in the GroupOrderList, then these
device drivers load after the device drivers with valid Tag values load.
For these device drivers, the order of loading is not guaranteed, other
than that all device drivers in a group load before the next group loads.
<P>
Here is a partial output of the GroupOrderList:
<P>
<PRE>      \registry\machine\system\currentcontrolset\control\grouporderlist
          Base = REG_BINARY 0d 00 00 00 01 00...
          Extended base = REG_BINARY 04 00 00 00 01 00...
          Filter = REG_BINARY 05 00 00 00 01 00...
          Keyboard Class = REG_BINARY 01 00 00 00 01 00...
          Keyboard Port = REG_BINARY 01 00 00 00 01 00...
          Ndis = REG_BINARY 09 00 00 00 01 00...
          Pointer Class = REG_BINARY 01 00 00 00 01 00...
          Pointer Port = REG_BINARY 03 00 00 00 01 00...
          .
          .
          .

</PRE>NOTE: There is no value for SCSI class. Not every group is represented in
the GroupOrderList. When a group is not in the GroupOrderList, the order in
which device drivers load within the group cannot be guaranteed.
<P>
As with the ServiceGroupOrder, the GroupOrderList can be modified. Using
the same example as above, Tag entries for SCSI class can be added:
<P>
<PRE>      \registry\machine\system\currentcontrolset\control\grouporderlist
          SCSI class = REG_BINARY 02 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 01 00 00 00
          Base = REG_BINARY 0d 00 00 00 01 00...
          Extended base = REG_BINARY 04 00 00 00 01 00...
          .
          .
          .

</PRE>In this example, the group SCSI class recognizes two Tag values, 00000001
and 00000002. The order in which the Tag values load is 00000002 first,
followed by 00000001. If SAMPLDRV is in the SCSI class group, which is
the same as SCSIDISK, either Tag value guarantees that SAMPLDRV loads
before SCSIDISK because SCSIDISK has no Tag value and non-Tagged
drivers load last in a group.
<P>
If for some reason SCSIDISK is assigned a Tag value of 0x00000001,
SAMPLDRV loads before SCSIDISK when SAMPLDRV is assigned a Tag value
of 00000002:
<P>
<PRE>       \registry\machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\sampldrv
          Type = REG_DWORD 0x00000001
          Start = REG_DWORD 0x00000000
          Group = SCSI class
          ErrorControl = REG_DWORD 0x00000000
          DependOnGroup = REG_MULTI_SZ "SCSI miniport"
          Tag = REG_DWORD 0x00000002
