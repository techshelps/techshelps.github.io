The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Device Development Kit (DDK) for Windows NT,
   versions 3.1, 3.5, and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
There are many different protocols, such as Centronics, EPP, ECP, LapLink,
Dongles, and so forth, for reading from and writing to devices on the
parallel port. The Windows NT 3.1, 3.5, and 3.51 parallel drivers implement
the Centronics protocol for writing to printers. The parallel drivers for
Windows NT 3.5 also add the ability for many parallel device drivers to
share the parallel port. So, while Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 does not
directly support every parallel protocol, it does make it much easier to
add these protocols to the system.
<P>
For example, suppose that you want to add bidirectional capabilities. If
you have a device on the parallel port that understands the Centronics
protocol for writing to the device, and understands some other parallel
protocol for reading from the device, then you can write a separate
parallel class driver to implement READ. Then, an application can direct
its WRITE requests to the normal parallel driver and its READ requests to
the new specialized parallel driver. The contention between these two
drivers would be resolved by the parallel port contention support provided
by the Windows NT parallel port driver.
<P>
As another example, you can add a dongle parallel class driver, which would
allow applications to write to the printer and read from the dongle on the
same parallel port.
<P>
Future releases of Windows NT will implement other important parallel
protocols using the parallel port contention support released in Windows NT
versions 3.5 and 3.51.
