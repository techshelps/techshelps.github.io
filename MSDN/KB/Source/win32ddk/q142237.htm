<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
On systems using SCSI scanners, if the scanners are placed on more than one
SCSI adapter at the same time, some of the scanners will not be recognized
by Windows NT. The first scanner, regardless of which adapter it is on,
should always be recognized.
<P>
Consider a system with two SCSI adapters, with a SCSI scanner on each
adapter. Only one scanner will be found on this system, and the order in
which adapters are scanned is platform-dependent.
<P>
Note that there are no system event messages logged that indicate that this
problem is occurring.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The SCSI scanner class driver (Scsiscan.sys) keeps a count of the scanner
devices located during initialization. This count is incorrectly reset to
zero each time a new adapter is searched. When a new device name is created
for a scanner, it might conflict with a scanner device already created, so
the new scanner is not usable.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
As a temporary workaround, ensure that all scanners are on a single SCSI
adapter. With this setup, all scanners should be identified and claimed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the SCSISCAN driver. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
