<UL><LI>Microsoft Active Server Pages version 1.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to load secure Active Server Pages (ASP files) on Microsoft
Internet Information Server (IIS) servers with more than sixty virtual
Roots, you may get the following error even if the user account has been
Granted explicit rights to the file:
<P>
<PRE>   HTTP Error 401 Access Denied

</PRE>NOTE: This only occurs if the file permissions have been changed to grant
the user account rights to the file after it has been accessed at least
once.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because ASP caches template files after they have
been executed; therefore, they will not need to be continually recompiled.
The files are cached with a copy of the full Discretionary Access Control
List (DACL) as well as the file date attributes.
<P>
ASP uses the cached version of the DACL to determine if a user has
sufficient privilege to execute the ASP file.
<P>
On IIS with more than sixty virtual roots, cached template files are
reloaded when the files last modified date changes. Because changes in
file permissions do not change a file's last modified attribute, cached
versions of files are not reloaded after permission changes. Therefore,
the accounts recently given rights to a cached ASP file may get access
denied until the file is reloaded by a file size change, etc.
<P>
NOTE: ASP uses notification handles on IIS servers with less than sixty
virtual roots. Because notification handles trigger on security changes
this is not a problem for IIS servers with less than sixty virtual roots.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The Asp.dll file was modified to check for cached file reload based on
the files DACL as well as the last modified date.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Active Server
Pages version 1.0b. A supported fix is now available, but is not fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
