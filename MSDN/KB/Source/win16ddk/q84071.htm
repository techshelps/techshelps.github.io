<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Windows operating system, an application can use NetBIOS
functions in every Windows mode (real, standard, or 386 enhanced). However,
the application must conform to some rules, which are briefly discussed in
the text below.
<P>
For more information, see the WNBDEMO file in the Software/Data Library or
the article by Alok Sinha and Ray Patch titled "An Introduction to Network
Programming Using the NetBIOS Interface," page 61, in the March-April 1992
issue of the "Microsoft Systems Journal."
<P>
WNBDEMO contains sample source code and additional documentation for
NetBIOS under Windows.

<P>
Windows provides access to NetBIOS through the NetBIOSCall function. This
function is equivalent to issuing Interrupt 5Ch under MS-DOS. Although it
is legal to call Interrupt 5Ch directly from within Windows, this is not
the recommended practice; use NetBIOSCall.
<P>
An application should call the NetBIOSCall() function from assembly
language to ensure that the registers are preserved for the call. The
following is a short stub function that can be used to issue NetBIOS calls
under Windows:
<P>
<PRE>extrn     NETBIOSCALL : FAR
extrn     DOS3CALL : FAR

          assume  cs: _TEXT

_TEXT     SEGMENT WORD PUBLIC 'CODE'


</PRE>; WORD FAR PASCAL nbNetBIOS(LPNCB lpNCB)
<P>
<PRE>          PUBLIC  nbNetBIOS

</PRE>nbNetBIOS proc FAR
<P>
<PRE>          push    bp                    ; save bp
          mov     bp, sp                ; sp into bp for stack access
          push    es                    ; save es
          push    bx                    ; save bx

          mov     es, word ptr [bp + 8] ; put HIWORD into es
          mov     bx, word ptr [bp + 6] ; put LOWORD into bx

          call    NetBIOSCall           ; shazam!

          xor     ah, ah
          mov     al, byte ptr es:[bx + 1] ; return the return code

          pop     bx                    ; restore bx
          pop     es                    ; restore es
          mov     sp, bp                ; restore sp
          pop     bp                    ; restore bp
          ret     4                     ; return to caller
                                        ; fix-up stack

</PRE>This function takes a FAR pointer to an initialized network control block
(NCB) and returns the NCB's return code from the NetBIOS driver.
<P>
Unlike MS-DOS, Windows also has special memory requirements for NCBs and
post routines. The general rule of thumb is to fix the NCBs and post
routines in memory as much as possible to prevent paging, banking, or other
time-consuming operations during the time that the application uses the
NCBs and post routines.
<P>
For post routines, all code and data segments used by the routine must be
placed into FIXED segments of a dynamic-link library (DLL). This causes the
segments to be page locked, not banked, and to have other attributes
appropriate to the mode in which Windows is running. Because the FIXED
keyword is ignored for applications, this code must be placed in a DLL.
<P>
Remember that the post routine may call only the PostMessage(),
PostAppMessage(), and NetBIOSCall() functions; it cannot call any other
functions in Windows. To call the nbNetBIOS function given above from the
post routine, nbNetBIOS must be placed into a FIXED segment of a DLL and
the function must be reentrant.
<P>
NCBs should be allocated such that they are also page locked, not banked,
and have other attributes appropriate to the mode in which Windows is
running. The easiest way to do this is to use GlobalAlloc() to allocate
memory for the NCB either as GMEM_FIXED or to call the GlobalWire()
function to move the memory as low as possible in the address space
(followed by a call to GlobalPageLock() in 386 enhanced mode). If the
memory is allocated from a DLL with the GMEM_FIXED flag, then the memory
will also be page locked--this is true only for allocations from DLLs.
<P>
As stated above, for further information, refer to the WNBDEMO file in
the Software/Data Library.
