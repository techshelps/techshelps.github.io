The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit (DDK) for Windows,
   version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article answers questions frequently asked about the NDIS 3.0
specification and NDDK for Windows For Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Does Windows for Workgroups Support NDIS 3.0?</h3>
 
<P>
Yes, Windows for Workgroups Support NDIS 3.0, and it follows the
specification provided with the Network Drivers section of the Windows NT
version 3.5 DDK. In general, we recommend that you use the NDDK in
conjunction with the Windows NT version 3.5 DDK.
<P>
<P><h3>How Do I Build an NDIS 3.0 Driver for Windows for Workgroups?</h3>
 
<P>
To build an NDIS 3.0 driver for Windows for Workgroups, use the Windows NT
version 3.1 or 3.5 development system. Build your source code using Windows
NT version 3.1 or 3.5, and test it in under Windows NT. Then move your
source code to the Windows 3.11 environment and recompile and test using
the Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 NDDK from the MSDN Level 2 CD-ROM
set along with the 32-bit edition of the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler
version 1.0 or 1.1.
<P>
All of the makefiles are set up to use the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler
version 1.0 or 1.1 because this was the latest version when the NDDK was
released. You may be able to use a later version of the Microsoft C++
compiler or a third-party C compiler; however, at the very least, changes
will have to be made to the makefiles.
<P>
<P><h3>How Do I Remap Programs Written Under Windows NT?</h3>
 
<P>
There are no written guidelines that specify how to remap what you write in
the Windows NT registry with your Windows NT driver to your Windows for
Workgroups SYSTEM.INI and PROTOCOL.INI files. We recommend you look at the
sample drivers to see how this is done. For example, if you used an
NdisReadConfiguration function, put it in the PROTOCOL.INI. No parameters
should go in SYSTEM.INI.
<P>
<P><h3>Will Windows for Workgroups Work with ODI Drivers?</h3>
 
<P>
No, Windows for Workgroups does not work with ODI drivers. If you use
Windows for Workgroups with Novel's Netware, you need to use the MSIPX
protocol stack that comes with the product.
<P>
<P><h3>Should I Run Share If I Access Novell File Servers &amp; Windows Shared Dirs?</h3>
 
<P>
When running Windows for Workgroups workstations and accessing a mixture of
Novell file servers and Windows for Workgroups shared directories, you
should use the VSHARE.386 Virtual Device Driver. The SHARE TSR is not
required to correctly manage file locking on network drives.
<P>
The VSHARE.386 Virtual Device Driver provides the functionality of the
MS-DOS SHARE TSR within Windows. You shouldn't need to run SHARE unless you
are running an application that requires file sharing, is not based on
Windows, and is running outside of Windows.
