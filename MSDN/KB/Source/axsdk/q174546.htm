The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Internet Client SDK, versions 4.0, 4.01
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer (Programming), versions 4.0, 4.01
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Despite the fact that &lt;USAGE VALUE="Email"&gt; has been specified for a parent
ITEM element in a CDF file, the subscribed user never receives the e-mail
when a content update occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Two things may cause this problem to occur: either the user did not
specifically ask to receive e-mail notifications for content update when he
or she subscribed to the channel, or the SMTP server was not specified
correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In order for channel email notifications to get sent, all three conditions
have to be met:

<OL><P><LI>Specify &lt;USAGE VALUE="Email"&gt; in your CDF file, as in this example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;CHANNEL HREF="<B><A HREF="http://example.microsoft.com">http://example.microsoft.com</A></B>"&gt;
<PRE></PRE>         &lt;ITEM HREF="<B><A HREF="http://example.microsoft.com/emailthis.htm&gt;">http://example.microsoft.com/emailthis.htm&gt;</A></B>
            &lt;USAGE VALUE="Email" /&gt;
         &lt;/ITEM&gt;
      &lt;/CHANNEL&gt;

</PRE><P><LI>When subscribing to the channel, click the Customize button
   and select YES when asked if you want to be notified in an e-mail
   message when the page has changed. (This was added as a pre-requisite
   to receiving e-mail in response to user complaints about receiving
   unwanted e-mail from sites they subscribed to. Therefore, unless the
   user chooses to be notified, no e-mail will be sent.)

<P><LI>When prompted for an e-mail address, click the Change Address button and
   specify the right SMTP server name. If you do not know, ask your ISP
   (Internet Service Provider) what server name to specify.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If all three conditions above are met, an e-mail notification is sent to
the subscribed user in this format:
<P>
<PRE>   Subject:   Internet Explorer Notice: &lt;web site title&gt;
   Message:   &lt;site URL&gt; Your subscription to &lt;web site title&gt; has been
              updated.
              To view the subscription offline, click here: &lt;site URL&gt;

                             This message was sent by the Internet Explorer
4.0
              Information Delivery Agent.

</PRE></OL>If your e-mail client is HTML-aware, then the e-mail received is the actual
Web page specified in the &lt;ITEM&gt; tag in the CDF file.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a simple .cdf file with the following text. Save the file as
   Simple.CDF, and make it available on your HTTP server:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;channel HREF="<B>http://&lt;server</B> name&gt;/test.htm"&gt;
<PRE></PRE>         &lt;ITEM HREF="<B>http://&lt;server</B> name&gt;/mailme.htm"&gt;
            &lt;USAGE VALUE="Email" /&gt;
         &lt;/ITEM&gt;
      &lt;/channel&gt;

</PRE><P><LI>Run Simple.CDF through Xmlint.exe and Cdftest.exe (available in
   the Internet Client SDK under \inetsdk\bin\XMLint and
   \inetsdk\bin\cdftest, respectively).
<P>
   Verify that no errors are found in your .CDF file.

<P><LI>Subscribe to <B>http://&lt;your</B> server name&gt;/simple.cdf.

<P><LI>From the "Add Channel" wizard, click the Customize button, and when
   asked if you would like to get notified in an e-mail message when the
   page changes, select YES, click on the "Change Address" button and
   specify the correct e-mail address and SMTP server name to be used.
   Click the Finish button, and click OK to exit the Channel wizard.

<P><LI>The page you just subscribed to should come up full-screen in a channel
   window. (In the example above, Test.htm comes up full-screen.)

<P><LI>Modify the .cdf file to simulate a content update.

<P><LI>From the desktop channel bar, right-click on your newly added
   Simple.cdf channel, and select Update Now. This should cause your
   files to get downloaded again. And if changes were detected, should
   display a red gleam on the upper left hand corner of your channel logo.
<P>
   Or from Manage Subscriptions, right-click on your page, and choose
   Update Now. Verify that changes were detected, with the gleam on your
   icon, and Status set to "Updated."
<P>
   Note that if any of the HTMs specified as &lt;ITEM&gt; tags in the CDF are
   modified in step 6 above, instead of the CDF file, no changes are
   detected (that is, Status set to "Updated: No changes detected"), and
   therefore no gleam is displayed.

<P><LI>If new content is found, and assuming you specified the correct e-mail
   address and SMTP name, you should get an e-mail notification in your
   mailbox.
<P>
</OL>The information in this article also applies to e-mail notifications being
sent when a user subscribes to a favorite site directly (that is, from
Internet Explorer, navigating to your favorite site, and from the menu,
choosing to Add to Favorites). The only time an e-mail notification is sent
is if the user specifically clicks on the Customize button and asks to get
notified in e-mail when content is updated.
<P>
To subscribe to a Web page directly:

<UL><LI>Navigate to the page (preferably one you can change, so that you'll be
   able to see how when the page is updated, you get notified).

<LI>Select Favorites/Add to Favorites. Choose to Subscribe to the page,
   either  to tell you when page is updated, or to download the page for
   offline viewing.

<LI>Click on Customize and when prompted to receive notifications via e-
   mail, say Yes, and click on Change Address button and specify an e-mail
   address and SMTP names correctly. These are important to specify here.
   Otherwise, no e-mail will be received.

<LI>Click Finish, and click OK out of the Add Favorites wizard.

<LI>Now make a change to the .htm page you just subscribed to.

<LI>From Internet Explorer's Favorites menu, select Manage subscriptions.
   Select the site you subscribed to from the list, right-click on it and
   choose to "Update now."

<LI>Verify that your changes were detected by noticing a gleam on the upper-
   left hand corner of the icon next to your page name on the Manage
   Subscriptions list, and Status set to "Site changed."

<LI>Check your e-mail client and look for a mail message with subject line
   "Internet Explorer Notice: &lt;site URL&gt;"...same as above
