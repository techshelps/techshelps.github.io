<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a network administrative setup (setup /a) to install one of
the Microsoft applications listed above on a network drive, you may receive
one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot change the properties of SETUP.INI

   -or-

   Cannot change the properties of the file named _MSSETUP.EXE

   -or-

   Cannot change attributes of SETUP.INI

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You receive one of these error messages if either of the following is true:

<UL><LI>The Setup program is unable to change the attributes of the file to
   READ-ONLY (possibly because you don't have the appropriate write
   privileges to do this).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The Setup program is able to change the attributes of the file to
   READ-ONLY, but the network returns the message that the change was not
   successful.
<P>
</UL>This error message has been received on Novell networks, as well as on
other networks, such as PCNFS and LanManX.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
If you receive this error message, do the following to correct the problem:
<P>
<P><h3>Delete the Original SETUP.INI from Your Drive</h3>
 
<P>
If you receive the error message above, restart the workstation and rerun
the Setup program. If Setup, continues to fail, it may be because the
original SETUP.INI file is still present as a Read-Only file. To resolve
this problem, delete the original SETUP.INI file from your hard disk.
Remember that Office MUST be installed to an empty directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Modify NET.CFG or SHELL.CFG Files (Novell Only)</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Locate the file SHELL.CFG or NET.CFG on the workstation from which you
   are running the administrative setup of Office 4.0. If this file does
   not exist, create it using a text editor and place it in the same
   directory as NETX.COM.

<P><LI>Open the SHELL.CFG or NET.CFG file in a text editor. In the DOSREQUESTER
   section, change the line that reads
<P>
<P><PRE>      READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY=ON
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -to-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY=OFF
</PRE><P>
   If this line does not exist, create it. The entry must be
   indented (default 3 spaces) or it will be seen as an
   invalid section heading and not be used.
<P>
   Example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NETWARE DOS REQUESTER
<PRE></PRE>         READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY=OFF

   NOTE from Novell: DOS Requester version 1.20 fixes this.

      Read Only Compatibility = Off | On  (default Off)

   This is not a new parameter, but the default has been changed with
   release 1.20 of the DOS Requester. In the last major release of the
   Requester this parameter defaulted to On. However, this default
   setting caused problems with a number of applications, so the
   parameter is now set to Off by default.

</PRE><P><LI>If the workstation is using the NetWare VLM shell version 1.1, (Netware
   3.11), continue with the steps in the following section "VLM version
   1.1". If you are not running VLM version 1.1, continue with steps 4-6
   below.
<P>
   NOTE: In many cases, the procedure described in the section "VLM Version
   1.1" will not be required. This process is time consuming. Continue with
   steps 4 through 6 below and perform the VLM procedure only if the
   problem persists.

<P><LI>Log off of the network, restart the workstation and connect to
   the server again.

<P><LI>Log on to the network, start Windows, and run setup /a from the
   Microsoft Office integrated Setup to install the application. The
   MSOFFICE directory must be empty for successful installation to occur.

<P><LI>When the application is installed, change the option in the SHELL.CFG or
   NET.CFG file back to =ON in case there are applications on the system
   that require this setting.
<P>
</OL><h3>VLM Version 1.1</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using VLM version 1.1, you can obtain this updated version of
the VLM shell. Novell has made these files available on CompuServe in the
NOVFILES forum and on FTP.NOVELL.COM. VLMUP2.EXE (a self-extracting file)
contains all the updated VLMs (Pre-release v1.20), the updated ODI drivers
(LSL.COM and IPXODI.COM), the updated MLIDs, and other associated files.
<P>
To find the version of VLM that you are using, type the following at the
MS-DOS prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   VLM /d

</PRE></OL>If this command presents too much information at one time, type the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   VLM /d | more

</PRE>NOTE: The pipe symbol (|) and the word "more" direct the command to display
information one screen at a time
<P>
<P><h3>VLM Version 1.1</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running VLM version 1.1, use the following steps to resolve this
problem. (Note that these steps should be taken AFTER you complete the
first two steps in the "Modify NET.CFG or SHELL.CFG Files" section above):

<OL><P><LI>Remove the VLM shell and use the NETX shell to complete the
   administrative setup. If you cannot use NETX, you can install the VLM
   shell version 1.0. However, because reinstalling VLM version 1.0 is very
   time consuming, using NETX is the preferred method.

<P><LI>Log off of the network and restart the workstation.

<P><LI>Log on to the network, start Windows, and run setup /a from the
   Microsoft Office integrated setup to install the application. The
   MSOFFICE directory must be empty for successful installation to occur.

<P><LI>When the application is installed, change the option in the SHELL.CFG or
   NET.CFG file back to =ON in case there are applications on the system
   that require this setting. You can then use the VLM shell version 1.1
   again without experiencing any problems.
<P>
</OL>Note that VLM is the latest version of the shell from Novell, replacing
NETX. The VLM shell ships with Netware versions 3.12, 4.00, 4.01, 4.02
and Personal Netware. However, this shell can be used on any version of
Netware.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY is an option used by the Novell workstation
redirector, NETX.COM. This option determines whether or not an attempt to
open a read-only file for write access fails. Prior to Novell NetWare
version 2.1x, a program could open a read-only file for write access
without generating an error message. With NetWare version 2.1 and later
versions, write access is not granted when opening a read-only file. With
the READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY option in the SHELL.CFG or NET.CFG file set to
ON, the workstation redirector allows write access to a read-only file
without generating an error message.
