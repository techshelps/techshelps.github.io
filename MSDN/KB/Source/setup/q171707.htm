The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for either of the following programs
included with Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Excel 97
   Microsoft Word 97

</PRE>you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Small Business Edition Setup
   This version of Office 97 Small Business Edition will load only on
   versions of the operating system which have been preinstalled by the
   PC manufacturer. Contact your PC manufacturer if this product will not
   load on your PC.

</PRE>When you click OK, you receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Excel 97 Setup was not completed successfully.

   -or-

   Microsoft Word 97 Setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are installing the version of Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Word
   97 that is included with the Delivery Service Partner version of
   Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The Delivery Service Partner version of Microsoft Windows 95 has not
   been preinstalled on your computer by your System Builder.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: This problem does not occur when you run the Setup programs for the
other programs included with Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition.
<P>
For more information about the Delivery Service Partner program, see the
"More Information" section in this article.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The versions of Microsoft Excel 97 and Microsoft Word 97 that are included
with the Delivery Service Partner version of Microsoft Office 97 Small
Business Edition may be installed only on a computer that is running a
Delivery Service Partner version of Microsoft Windows 95 that was
preinstalled by your System Builder. If you reformat your hard disk and
either install another operating system or reinstall the version of
Windows 95 that was included with your computer, you must either obtain a
retail version of Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition, or have your
System Builder preinstall Windows 95 on the computer again.
<P>
Contact your System Builder for information about how to obtain a retail
version of Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the Setup programs included with the Delivery
Service Partner version of Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you purchase a computer that comes with a preinstalled version of
Microsoft Windows 95, one of three different versions of Windows 95 may be
installed: retail, OEM, or Delivery Service Partner.

<UL><LI>The retail version of Windows 95 is the same package that you can
   purchase from any software retailer. This version of Windows 95 is
   designed to be used on any compatible computer.

<LI>The OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) version of Windows 95 is
   distributed only with new computers. You cannot purchase an OEM version
   of Windows 95 except with a new computer. Most large computer vendors
   distribute OEM versions of Windows 95 with their computers.

<LI>The Delivery Service Partner version of Windows 95 is similar to the OEM
   version of Windows 95 in that it is distributed only with new computers
   and you cannot purchase a Delivery Service Partner version of Windows 95
   except with a new computer. Many smaller computer vendors include a
   Delivery Service Partner version of Windows 95 on new computers.
<P>
</UL>There is also a Delivery Service Partner version of Microsoft Office 97
Small Business Edition. This version of Microsoft Office 97 Small Business
Edition is distributed only with computers on which the Delivery Service
Partner version of Windows 95 is preinstalled.
<P>
When you run the Setup program for the versions of Microsoft Excel 97 and
Microsoft Word 97 that are included with the Delivery Service Partner
version of Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition, the Setup program
determines whether the Delivery Service Partner version of Windows 95 is
preinstalled on the computer by the vendor. If not, the Setup program does
not allow you to continue.
<P>
If you reformat your hard disk and install a new operating system, or if
you reformat your hard disk and reinstall the version of Windows 95 that
was included with the computer, the operating system is no longer
preinstalled by the vendor. As a result, the Setup program determines that
the Delivery Service Partner version of Windows 95 is not preinstalled on
the computer, and you cannot continue. In this case, you must either:

<UL><LI>Obtain a non-Delivery Service Partner version of Microsoft Office 97
   Small Business Edition or Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Have the computer vendor re-preinstall Windows 95 on your computer.
   When the vendor does this, the operating system is preinstalled on the
   computer.
