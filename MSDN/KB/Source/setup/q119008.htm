<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a post administrative setup using a modified SETUP.STF
file, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;application name&gt; Setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible causes for this error message:

<UL><LI>An invalid directory name was specified in the setup script. For more
   information about this topic, query on the following words in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      specify and destination and setup and script
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>The number groups that are used in various locations within the
   SETUP.STF file were inadvertently modified. This can happen if
   Windows is configured to use a space as the 1000 separator
   (this is common in Europe), and the file is edited in a spreadsheet
   program such as Microsoft Excel.
<P>
   When the spreadsheet program reads the number in the SETUP.STF file and
   Windows is using a space as the 1000 separator, the spreadsheet program
   may interpret these numbers as one long number. When the file is saved,
   the new number is saved in place of the number groups. This causes Setup
   to fail.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Set Windows to use a space character as the 1000 separator:
<P>
   a. Start Control Panel and double-click the International icon.
<P>
   b. In the Number Format area, choose Change.
<P>
   c. In the 1000 Separator box, select the listed character and press the
<P><PRE>      SPACEBAR to replace it with a space.
</PRE><P>
   d. Click OK. Close Control Panel.

<P><LI>Back up your SETUP.STF file by copying it to a floppy disk and renaming
   it SETUPSTF.BAK. (It is important to back up SETUP.STF before making any
   modifications to it, just in case the modifications don't work.)
<P>
   SETUP.STF is typically located in the same directory as the shared
   application on the network server.

<P><LI>Open the SETUP.STF file in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft
   Excel.

<P><LI>Save the file.

<P><LI>Run Setup.
<P>
</OL>The following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;application name&gt; Setup was not completed successfully.
</PRE>
