</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for one of the applications listed above,
your floppy drive may be unable to read Disk 1 and you receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Insufficient memory to run this application. Quit one or more Windows
   applications and then try again.

</PRE>This error message may occur even if no other applications are currently
running and sufficient memory IS available in Windows. The following are
possible causes and resolutions for this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSES</h2>
 
<P>
This error message may be caused by any of the following:

<UL><LI>The CMOS setting for your floppy disk drive has been changed so that the
   disk is formatted as a 720K disk drive rather than a 1.44 megabyte (MB)
   disk drive (which is the required size if you are installing Microsoft
   Excel from high-density 3.5-inch floppy disks). The CMOS settings for
   the floppy disk drive may be lost if your computer has a weak battery
   connection or if it is affected by a power surge. When the CMOS settings
   are lost, the floppy disk drive is reset to the 720K default. This is
   the most common cause of this error message.
<P>
   NOTE: This problem with the CMOS setting is most likely to occur with
   laptop computers, notebook computers, or any computer that has been
   physically moved or affected by power surges, black-outs, or brown-outs.
<P>
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You are using MS-DOS 6 or MS-DOS 6.2 VSAFE
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The Setup Disk 1 or SETUP.EXE file is damaged (this can occur during
   manufacturing, during shipping, or if the disk is mishandled).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Your disk drive itself is damaged.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The anti-virus program is present and loaded high in your system
   configuration for Microsoft Excel 5.0.
<P>

<P>
<P><h3>To Test for a Damaged SETUP.EXE File</h3>
 
<P>
To test for a damaged SETUP.EXE file, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Put the Setup Disk 1 in your floppy disk drive (for example, drive A).

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dir a:\setup.exe
</PRE><P>
   where A is the drive in which you placed the Setup Disk 1.
<P>
</OL>The file size of the SETUP.EXE file should match the file size in the
following table.

</PRE></OL><h3>To Test for a Damaged Setup Disk 1 or a Damaged Floppy Disk Drive</h3>
 
<P>
To test to see if the problem is caused by a bad disk or because of a
problem with your floppy disk drive, use the COPY command to copy the
contents of any disk that has the same density as the application disks to
the hard disk drive, or use the DISKCOPY command to copy the disk contents
to another floppy disk:

<UL><LI>If you can successfully copy other floppy disks of the same density to
   the hard drive (or to another floppy disk), and the problem only occurs
   with the application disk, then the problem is most likely the result of
   a bad disk.

<LI>If either of these copy procedures results in an error message, there is
   a problem with your floppy disk drive.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Typing the DIR command to view the contents of the floppy disk and
looking at the disk contents in File Manager are not reliable ways to test
for these problems: when you display the contents of a disk, you only
accesses the disk's file allocation table, you do not access every sector
on the disk.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around these problems, follow the appropriate procedure below.
<P>
<P><h3>You are using MS-DOS 6 or MS-DOS 6.2 VSAFE</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using MS-DOS 6 or MS-DOS 6.2 and loading VSAFE, you may receive
the error message noted above, even when your machine is correctly
configured. To work around this problem, remark out (REM) VSAFE in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file, reboot your computer, and then install the application.
<P>
<P><h3>The CMOS Settings Have Been Lost</h3>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, go into the CMOS setup on your computer and
set the floppy disk drive back to 1.44 MB. For more information,
contact your hardware vendor.
<P>
NOTE: If your floppy disk drive is not a 1.44 MB, high-density disk drive,
you will not be able to change the CMOS floppy disk drive setting. In this
case, you must use 720K low-density disks to set up the application on your
computer.
<P>
<P><h3>The Setup Disk Is Damaged</h3>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, you must order a new set of disks. To do this,
call Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400. If you are
outside the United States, contact the Microsoft subsidiary for your area.
To locate your subsidiary, see the Microsoft World Wide Offices Web site
at:

</PRE><h3>There Is a Hardware Problem with Your Floppy Disk Drive</h3>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, use diagnostic software with your floppy disk
drive and have a qualified hardware technician examine it.
