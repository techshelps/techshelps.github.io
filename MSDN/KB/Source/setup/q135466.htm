<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a Workstation installation of your Windows 95 application,
the shared files may be installed to the following folder on your local
workstation
<P>
<PRE>   c:\Program Files\Microsoft Shared\Common Files

</PRE>even if you chose to have the shared files installed on the network server
during Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when Setup cannot resolve the path to the Microsoft
shared files on the network server during the Workstation installation. In
this case, Setup copies the files to your local workstation instead.
<P>
You do not receive any indication that the files are being installed
locally, even though you chose to have them installed on the network
server.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
During the administrative installation (Setup /a) for the applications
listed above, you have the option to specify how the user is going to
access the shared files; namely, by using the server name or drive letter.
In general, this problem only occurs when you enter a Universal Naming
Convention (UNC) path during the administrative installation.
<P>
To work around this problem, select the Drive Letter option in the Network
Server Confirmation dialog box (during the administrative installation) so
that Setup does not have to resolve a UNC path to the server during the
workstation installation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To test whether this is a problem using UNC on your workstation, run an
application on the server by using a UNC path. For example, to run
"program.exe" on the network server, use the following command line:
<P>
<PRE>   \\server\share\program.exe

</PRE>If the application does not run, you need to select the option to use
logical drive mappings instead of UNC during the administrative
installation (see the "Workaround" section above).
<P>
NOTE: If you are using the TCP/IP network protocol, you may want to contact
your TCP/IP vendor to determine how to get UNC support.
