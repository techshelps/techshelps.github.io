<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform an administrative installation (Setup /a) of one of
the applications listed above, you are prompted to choose where to
install the shared applications on the server, and where the files
will be installed on the workstation. These files are installed to
the MSAPPS directory. The administrative installation also installs a
number of files to the SYSTEM subdirectory of the Microsoft Office
directory on the network server.
<P>
When you run the Setup program in maintenance mode, and you choose to
remove one of the application components, you may receive a dialog box
asking if you want to remove the shared files.
<P>
The following information discusses the difference between these system
files, and the shared files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Shared Files</h3>
 
<P>
The shared files include, but are not limited to, the Spelling checker
files, text converters, and the Microsoft System Info application
(MSINFO.EXE); shared files are shared by more than one application (or
computer with a workstation installation). In general, the shared files are
located in the MSAPPS directory, on the server or on the workstation.
<P>
<P><h3>System Files</h3>
 
<P>
The system files are those files that are used by Microsoft Windows,
such as .DLL files, and are located in the \SYSTEM subdirectory of the
application directory on the network server. They are copied to the
\SYSTEM subdirectory of your Microsoft Windows directory when you run a
workstation installation.
<P>
<P><h3>Administrative Installation</h3>
 
<P>
When you run an administrative installation of the application, all of the
files are installed to the single directory that you enter for the
application, such as F:\MSOFFICE. No subdirectories are created when you
choose a location for the shared files. This option just sets a particular
field in the setup table file, SETUP.STF that is created on the network.
This field (tenth line in the top-level information of the SETUP.STF file)
is set to either local, shared, or user-choice depending on the option that
you choose during the server installation. When Setup is run on the
workstation, this field is accessed and the workstation Setup performs the
appropriate action.
<P>
<P><h3>Workstation Installation</h3>
 
<P>
When you run the workstation installation, if you choose to install the
shared files to the local hard drive, Setup creates an MSAPPS subdirectory
in the current Windows directory, whether it is located on the network or
on the local hard drive. The shared files are installed to the MSAPPS
directory. If you choose to install the shared files as shared, Setup
leaves the files on the network and modifies the REG.DAT file and your
WIN.INI file with the network location information.
<P>
Note that you do not have the option during Setup to change the directory
in which the shared files are installed.
