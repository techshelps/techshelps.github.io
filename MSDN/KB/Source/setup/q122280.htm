The information in this article applies to:

</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for one of the programs listed at the
beginning of this article, after you insert Disk 2, you may receive any of
the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to expand MSOFF2.CAB.

   -or-

   The compressed file '&lt;drive&gt;\msoff2.cab' cannot be decompressed
   and may be corrupted.

   -or-

   System Error: cannot read from drive A:

   -or-

   Setup: Could not read from file named A:\WORD2.CAB

   -or-

   The compressed file A:\WORD2.CAB cannot be decompressed and may be
   corrupted.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
One or more of these errors will occur if you run Setup on a computer
running OS/2 Warp Version 3. This behavior occurs because the floppy disks
that contain the programs use Distribution Media Format (DMF). This floppy
disk format was developed before OS/2 Warp was released, so there was no
opportunity for compatibility testing.
<P>
NOTE: OS/2 Warp Version 3 ships in two different packs. One box has a red
spine while the other box has a blue spine. The blue version is called OS/2
Warp Version 3 Connect. This version is able to read DMF disks if you chose
to make Win-OS/2 capabilities available when you installed OS/2. The red
version cannot read DMF disks, even if you set up Win-OS/2 capabilities.
<P>
These errors have also been reported when running OS/2 version 2.0 or 2.1.
Microsoft has been unable to reproduce this behavior in testing.
<P>
Because Disk 1 of the Setup program does not use DMF, the files contained
on this disk are copied correctly to your computer when you are running
OS/2. However, when the Setup program prompts you to insert Disk 2, you
receive the error message, and you cannot complete the Setup program.
<P>
Note: Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0, will not install or
function under OS/2 under any circumstances.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, contact Microsoft to obtain a replacement set
of floppy disks that are not DMF formatted.
