<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.2, 4.2c, 4.3, 4.3c
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0b

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information discusses how to perform an administrative
installation (Setup /a) of any one of the applications listed above.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Before You Perform an Administrative Installation</h3>
 
<P>
The following conditions must be true before you install the application to
the network server:

<UL><LI>You must have read, write, create, and delete/erase privileges for the
   network directories in which you want to install the application. For
   more information, see your network software documentation.

<LI>You must be running a Microsoft Windows operating environment on the
   workstation you will use to install the application on the network.
   Note: Windows should be installed in a shared location if future users
   will run a shared version of Windows. You may install Windows on the
   hard drive if users will run local copies of Windows.

<LI>If you are installing to a shared Windows configuration, you must have
   full network privileges in order to update the shared Windows
   installation (with the OLE 2.0 .DLL files, fonts, and so on.) so that
   when the workstation installations are performed, these files do not
   have to be copied to the user's Windows directory. The application Setup
   program automatically updates shared Windows as long as you have write
   privileges to the Windows directory.

<LI>Users who share applications or Windows on the network server must log
   off. Any directories on the network server that contain shared
   components, such as X:\WINDOWS and X:\MSAPPS, must be locked from user
   access for the duration of the administrative installation.
<P>
</UL>Installing an application on a network is a two part process: (1)
installing the application to the network server, and (2) installing the
application to the workstation.
<P>
To install the application to a network server:
<P>
To set up an application on a network server, you must run the Setup
program using the following command line
<P>
<PRE>   setup /a

</PRE>from a workstation connected to that server. When you install the
application on the server you must install it into an empty directory. Be
sure that you delete all of the files and subdirectories contained in that
directory. Be sure to move any custom files, such as company templates,
from the application directory or subdirectories.
<P>
If you run Setup from the server itself, the Setup program displays a
message indicating that it could not detect a network server and path for
the application program directory and asking for the correct server and
path. If you continue with the installation, all workstations that are set
up from that network server will have copies of the shared components
installed on their local hard drive. To avoid this behavior, exit the Setup
program and then run it from a workstation connected to the network server.
<P>
To install the application to a workstation:
<P>
After you have installed the application to the network server using the
administrative installation (setup /a), you must run the Setup program on
each of the workstations. When you do this, you can choose to install the
application to the workstation's hard drive, or to run the application from
the network server (this option installs a minimal number of files to the
workstation's hard drive.)
<P>
<P><h3>Removing an Administrative Installation</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot use the Setup program to remove an administrative installation
of an application. You must delete the files and directories on the server
manually. You can only run the Setup program in maintenance mode to do
either of the following:

<UL><LI>Remove or add components to a workstation
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Remove a local installation of the application
<P>
</UL><h3>Upgrading a Server Installation</h3>
 
<P>
When you perform an administrative installation of an application on a
network server, you must install it to a new or empty directory. This is
necessary to avoid overwriting files that are required by network users. If
you want to upgrade an existing installation of an application in a
directory of the same name, you must delete all of the files and
subdirectories contained in that directory (be sure to move any custom
files, such as company templates, from the application directory or
subdirectories). You can then install the files to this directory. Also
note that with Office Professional, you should backup the Workdir
directory before you attempt to install.
<P>
If you are updating an installation of an application that was installed as
part of Microsoft Office, you will not be able to install the updated
version of the application, using the network Office Setup. For example, if
you installed Microsoft Office version 4.0 to the network server, you
cannot install Microsoft PowerPoint 4.0 to workstations using the network
Office 4.0 Setup (because it only knows about the version of the
application that it installed, PowerPoint 3.0).
<P>
There is no way to keep the integrated setup of Office 4.0 when you update
individual Office applications in a network installation. You must install
the updated application in a separate subdirectory on the server, instead
of in the Microsoft Office directory. If you install the updated
application in the network directory of Office, the Office SETUP.STF file
is overwritten, preventing you from being able to run Office Setup in
maintenance mode from the workstation.
<P>

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Program Setup Runs Instead of Office Setup

</PRE><h3>Upgrading a Workstation Installation</h3>
 
<P>
After you have upgraded the version of an application on the network
server, you must run the Setup program again on each of the workstations.
