<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install a program to a compressed drive, you may receive a "disk
full" error message. This behavior may occur after the Setup program
indicates (at the beginning of the installation) that you have sufficient
disk space to install all of the desired components.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you install to a compressed drive, the amount of disk space reported
as being available may be misleading depending on the types of files that
are on the compressed drive and how effective the disk compression
technology is when you compress different types of data. Because this
number may be incorrect, you may need significantly more disk space than is
reported as being required by setup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You are most likely to run into this problem if the types of files that are
being installed to the compressed drive are files that cannot be
effectively compressed by the disk compression method being used.
<P>
For example, the clip art files that come with PowerPoint version 4.0 for
Windows are in a special PictureStore format (*.pcs) that is so highly
compressed that they cannot be compressed any more. If your compression
technology is assuming an average compression ratio of 2:1, this means that
for each 1 megabyte (MB) of *.pcs files that you choose to install, you
would actually need to have 2 MB of compressed drive space available.
PowerPoint includes over 5 MB of *.pcs files, so when you install to a 2:1
compressed drive, you will need 5 MB more available disk space than setup
says is required.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
