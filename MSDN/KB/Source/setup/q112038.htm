<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup program that is included with the products listed above, produces
the following error message when it updates your system files (at the end
of the setup process):
<P>
<PRE>   ACMSETUP Caused a General Protection Fault in Module MSSETUP.DLL at
   0021:0238.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when both of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are running Microsoft Windows 3.1
<P>
   -and-

<LI>There are sections in the SYSTEM.INI file that are not separated by
   blank lines. (Normally there are several sections in the SYSTEM.INI
   and the sections are separated by blank lines. If these lines
   get deleted or replaced with other entries during the setup of other
   programs, drivers, or utilities, you may experience this problem.)
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Sometimes it may appear that there is blank line, but the line
actually contains one or more spaces. Inserting an additional blank line
between sections ensures that there is at least one blank line as required.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Edit the SYSTEM.INI file and add a blank line between each section.
   The first line in each section is enclosed in square brackets. The
   SYSTEM.INI file is a text file and can be edited in any standard text
   editor (such as Windows Notepad or Windows Write). If you use Microsoft
   Write as a text editor, you must choose 'No Conversion' when you open
   the file. If you do not, your file will be corrupted.

<P><LI>Quit Windows.
<P>
   NOTE: This step is necessary because the Setup program did not quit
   normally. If you don't exit Windows, you will probably get a sharing
   violation because the setup files are still in use.

<P><LI>Restart Windows.

<P><LI>Re-install the program. If you install the program to the same location,
   you should not have to delete any files before re-installing.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: PowerPoint 4.0c Setup prevents this problem in PowerPoint.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In some configurations you may also experience a sharing violation
when you choose Close to get rid of the GP fault error message. This only
occurs on systems where a swap file is being used. You can ignore this
message and follow the instructions listed above to resolve the
problem. You will not receive the sharing violation at the end of the
re-installation of the product.
<P>
If you don't re-install, you may experience problems using the product
because the Setup program was unable to make the necessary changes to your
system.
