The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual FoxPro, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to install Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0 or
Microsoft Visual FoxPro, version 5.0 on your computer, you may receive the
following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to load installable ISAM
   Can't load mspdox35.dll (error code=126)

   -and-

   Error while configuring ODBC drivers!
   The configuration of the ODBC Microsoft Paradox Driver (*.db) driver
   failed.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You have previously installed Microsoft Office 97 on this computer.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You did not install the Paradox ODBC driver, included in the Microsoft
   Office 97 Data Access Pack, on this computer.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, either:

<UL><LI>Install the Data Access Pack included with Microsoft Office 97. To do
   this, run the file Dataacc.exe, located in the \ValuPack\DatAcc folder
   on your Microsoft Office 97 compact disc.
<P>
   Once the Data Access Pack is installed, the Setup programs for
   Microsoft Office 7.0 and Microsoft Visual FoxPro 5.0 should work
   correctly.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Before running the Setup program for Microsoft Office 7.0 or Microsoft
   Visual FoxPro 5.0, rename the following files in your Windows\System
   folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Msjt3032.dll
      Odbcji32.dll
      Odbcjt32.dll
      Odbctl32.dll
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office versions 7.0 and 97 and Microsoft Visual FoxPro 5.0
install a set of database files, known as Jet files, on your computer. Jet
files are designed to be used by any program that works with database
files.
<P>
Microsoft Office 97 behaves differently with respect to Jet files than
Microsoft Office 7.0 and Microsoft Visual FoxPro 5.0:

<UL><LI>By default, Microsoft Office 97 does not install the Paradox driver:
   if you want the Paradox driver installed, you must install the Data
   Access Pack. This differs from Microsoft Office 7.0 and Microsoft
   Visual FoxPro 5.0, which automatically install the Paradox driver.

<LI>Microsoft Office 97 installs a newer version of the Jet files than the
   versions installed by Microsoft Office 7.0 and Microsoft Visual FoxPro
   5.0.

<LI>Some Jet files have changed names from one version to the next:
   specifically, the Paradox driver's name can be either Mspdox35.dll or
   Mspdox32.dll, depending on which version of the Jet files is installed
   on your computer.
<P>
</UL>Because of the change in behavior with respect to the Paradox driver, the
change in versions of the Jet files, and the change in file names, you may
encounter problems when installing programs that use an older version of
the Jet files, such as Microsoft Office 7.0 or Microsoft Visual FoxPro 5.0,
after installing programs that use a newer version of the Jet files, such
as Microsoft Office 97. Note that you will encounter problems only when you
install an older program after you have installed Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
To prevent problems from occurring, use either of the workarounds shown in
the "Workaround" section.
