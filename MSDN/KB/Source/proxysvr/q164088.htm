The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Proxy Server, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains important information about Microsoft Proxy Server
installation requirements. For more information, please review Chapter 2
of the Microsoft Proxy Server online documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Proxy Server has the same hardware requirements as Microsoft
Windows NT Server version 4.0. For more information, see the documentation
for Windows NT Server version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Software Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
The following programs must already be installed on the server computer
before Microsoft Proxy Server can be installed:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server version 2.0

<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 1 (provided on the
   Microsoft Proxy Server compact disc)
<P>
</UL>The server computer can be configured as a stand-alone server, a primary
domain controller (PDC), or a backup domain controller (BDC). However, for
the highest security level and the best performance, it is recommended
that you install Microsoft Proxy Server on a computer configured as a
stand-alone server. For more information about member servers, PDCs, and
BDCs, see the documentation for Windows NT Server.
<P>
For best cache performance, it is strongly recommended that at least one
disk drive on the server computer be configured as a Windows NT File
System (NTFS) volume.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before you install Microsoft Proxy Server, complete the following tasks:
<P>
Verify your software configuration:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 1 is
   installed.

<P><LI>Verify that Microsoft Internet Information Server 2.0 is installed.

<P><LI>Verify that TCP/IP is installed on the server.
<P>
</OL>Verify your hardware configuration:

<OL><P><LI>Setting Up the Disk Drives
<P>
</OL>Microsoft Proxy Server can be installed on computers that have their hard
disks configured as file allocation table (FAT) or NTFS volumes. However,
for security and performance, it is recommended that at least one of the
server's hard disks be configured as an NTFS volume.
<P>
Features that NTFS volumes provide (and FAT volumes do not) include:

<UL><LI>A maximum file size of up to 64 gigabytes (GB), depending on the size
   of the disk clusters.

<LI>Integration with Windows NT Server security to control and audit file,
   share, and directory access.

<LI>An Activity log that you can use to restore the disk in the event of
   a power failure or other problem.

<LI>Support for flexible per-file compression.
<P>
</UL>The Web Proxy service of Microsoft Proxy Server stores cached Internet
objects on one or more of the server's disk drives. The particular disk
drives used for this purpose are selected during installation. For best
cache performance, it is strongly recommended that you configure all
drives that have space allocated to the cache as NTFS drives.
<P>
If your current server disk volume is formatted to use FAT partitions,
you can convert these partitions to NTFS (before or after installing
Microsoft Proxy Server) using the Convert program included with Windows NT
Server. Convert does not overwrite data on the disk. For more information
about using this program to convert FAT volumes to NTFS volumes, see your
documentation for Windows NT Server, or type "convert /?" (without the
quotation marks) at the command line in the Command Prompt window.

<OL><P><LI>Setting Up the Network Adapter Cards
<P>
</OL>Before you install Microsoft Proxy Server, verify that network adapter
cards are installed and configured properly. To create a secure
configuration, the Microsoft Proxy Server computer must have at least one
network adapter card connected to the private network, plus one network
adapter card, modem, or integrated services digital network (ISDN) adapter
to connect to the Internet.
<P>
You should install the network adapter cards in your server computer
before installing Microsoft Proxy Server. For more information on
installing network adapter cards, refer to documentation provided with
your adapter cards. Once the adapter cards are installed, you can use the
Network Control Panel to configure each card.
<P>
To configure additional network adapter cards, perform the following
steps:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Open Control Panel.

   2. Double-click the Network icon, and then click the Adapters tab.

   3. Click the Add button to add the additional network adapter card.

</PRE></OL>To configure TCP/IP settings for internal and external network adapter
cards, perform the following steps:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Set TCP/IP protocol bindings for the external network adapter card.

   Set the binding to TCP/IP, so that it can communicate over the
   Internet. When binding this network card to TCP/IP, you are prompted
   for the card's Internet Protocol address. This address is usually
   supplied by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

   If the external network adapter card will be used to connect to the
   Internet, it must be bound only to the TCP/IP protocol. In particular,
   do not bind IPX/SPX or NetBEUI to the externally connected cards.

   2. Set protocol bindings for the internal network adapter card.

   If the server will be running the Web Proxy service, the network
   adapter card connected to the private network must be bound to TCP/IP.
   If the server will be running the WinSock Proxy service, the network
   adapter card connected to the private network can be bound to TCP/IP,
   IPX/SPX, or both.

   NOTE: You can choose to implement Microsoft Proxy Server on a server
   that has only one network adapter card. You can use this configuration
   primarily to provide limited proxy service in the following ways:

    - Caching service for internal Web Proxy clients.

    - An IP application-level gateway to support internal IPX clients that
      use the WinSock Proxy service.

   3. Use one default IP gateway.

   A Microsoft Proxy Server computer should have only one IP default
   gateway. The IP address of the default gateway should be configured on
   the external network adapter card only.

   4. Disable dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) for the adapter
   cards.

   Use static IP addresses on the adapter cards. DHCP will attempt to
   reset the IP default gateway you selected for Microsoft Proxy Server.

</PRE><P><LI>Setting Up a Modem or ISDN Adapter
<P>
</OL>RAS and Microsoft Proxy Server:
<P>
With Microsoft Proxy Server, you can use the Windows NT Server Remote
Access Service (RAS) dial-out client to connect to an ISP. RAS dial-out
requires the use of at least one of the following on the Server computer:

<UL><LI>Modem - You can install one or more modems. High-speed modems, such as
   28.8 Kbps modems, are recommended.

<LI>ISDN adapter - If you are using an ISDN line and have signed up for the
   ISDN service option with an ISP, install an ISDN adapter.
<P>
</UL>When selecting any hardware for use with a dial-up network connection,
check the Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List to confirm that the modem
or adapter you are purchasing is supported. Microsoft has tested the
modems and ISDN adapters on this list for use with RAS.
<P>
Also, try to select a modem or ISDN adapter that is the same or very close
to the one that is used by the ISP you are using. This helps to ensure
optimal performance and the highest possible connection rates.
<P>
For information about selecting and installing a modem or ISDN adapter,
see your documentation for Windows NT Server 4.0 or documentation provided
with your modem or ISDN adapter.
<P>
Setting Up a Modem:
<P>
To set up a modem on the server computer, perform the following steps:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Install the modem and start the server computer.

   2. In Control Panel, double-click the Modems application icon.

   3. Follow the on-screen instructions for installing a new modem.

</PRE></OL>For information about installing a modem, see your documentation for
Windows NT Server 4.0 and the documentation provided with your modem.
<P>
Setting Up an ISDN Adapter:
<P>
ISDN offers a much faster communication speed than ordinary telephone
service that uses analog equipment. ISDN can operate at speeds of 64 or
128 Kb per second.
<P>
Unlike most available modems, not all ISDN hardware uses the same
signaling technology. This may introduce connection problems between your
ISDN provider (the local telephone company) and your hardware adapter. In
some cases, the adapter may not work at all with service in your area. For
this reason it is important to consult with both telephone and Internet
service providers you will be working with in your local area before
making a final selection on ISDN adapters. As with modems, obtaining an
adapter that is supported by Microsoft and on the Hardware Compatibility
List is also highly recommended.
<P>
To install an ISDN adapter, perform the following steps:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Install an ISDN card and start the server computer.

   2. In Control Panel, double-click the Network application icon, click
      the Adapters tab, and click Add.

   3. Follow the on-screen instructions to select or install a device
      driver for the ISDN adapter.

</PRE>You must restart the computer after you have installed the ISDN drivers.
Otherwise, not all of the available ISDN ports may be listed on the screen
when you configure Remote Access for ISDN.
<P>
Setting Up RAS:
<P>
You can install RAS either during or after the initial Windows NT Server
Setup. To install and configure RAS after Windows NT Server has been
installed, use the Network Control Panel. You will need to log on as a
member of the Administrators group. Also, because you are connecting to an
ISP, you need to have the TCP/IP protocol installed before installing RAS.
<P>
To install the RAS client with Microsoft Proxy Server, perform the
following steps:
<P>
<PRE>   1. In Control Panel, double-click Network, click the Services tab, and
      click Add.

   2. In the Network Service box, select Remote Access Service, and then
      click OK.

   3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation of
      the Remote Access Service.

</PRE>Select Dial out only for port usage to configure RAS for dialout-only
connection to an ISP. Port usage can be set by clicking Configure in the
Remote Access Service Setup dialog box.
<P>
Network protocol settings should include TCP/IP only (the IPX/SPX and
NetBEUI check boxes should be cleared). You can set the network protocols
by clicking Network in the Remote Access Service Setup dialog box.
