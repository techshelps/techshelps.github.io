<P>
<P><h2>SECTION 1: CONFIGURING PROXY ON A NETWORK WITH NOVELL NETWARE SERVERS</h2>
 
<P>
<P>
If your network contains Novell NetWare servers or IPX routers that seed
the network with the correct IPX frame type and network address, both the
client and server IPX configuration can be set to Auto. This will force the
proxy server and client to obtain their IPX settings automatically.
<P>
<P><h3>Proxy Server Settings</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Disable the IPX binding for the external adapter:
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon, and then click
<P><PRE>      Bindings.
</PRE>   b. Click "Show bindings for all Protocols."
   c. Choose IPX/SPX compatible transport.
   d. Select the Internet network card listed here and click Disable.
   e. Reboot the server.

<P><LI>Set the IPX protocol for auto configuration:
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon.
   b. Under Protocols, click "NWLink IPX/SPX compatible transport."
   c. Use the Internal Network Number: 00000000.
   d. Choose Auto Frame Type Detection.
   e. Reinstall Proxy Server so that the new settings are added to the
<P><PRE>      Mspclnt.ini file.
</PRE>   f. Open the Mspclnt.ini file (located in the \Msp\Clients folder on the
<P><PRE>      server). Verify that the section called [Servers IPX Addresses]
      section exists. This section should contain one IPX address
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Addr1=-&lt;address&gt;

      where &lt;address&gt; is a number like 00034567-1232fa34bb20.

</PRE><P><LI>Move the Internet binding on the proxy server. NOTE: If the Internet
   connection is being made through a Dial up connection, this section can

<P><PRE>      Bindings.
</PRE>   b. Click "Show Bindings for all protocols."
   c. Under NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible Transport, you should see your
<P><PRE>      network adapters listed.
</PRE>   d. Select the network adapter that you have connected to the Internet
<P><PRE>      and move it to the top of the list so that it is the first binding.
      This must be done even though IPX is disabled on this card.

</PRE><h2>SECTION 2: CONFIGURING PROXY ON AN ETHERNET NETWORK WITH NO NETWARE SERVERS</h2>
 
<P>
If you do not have a Novell NetWare server on the network (or a computer
running Windows NT server with an internal network number configured), IPX
clients will not autoconfigure their IPX settings correctly. Windows NT
will not respond to the client's routing information protocol (RIP)
broadcasts for the external network number. This occurs even if an external
network number and frame type are defined on the Windows NT Server
computer.
<P>
NOTE: If your connection to the Internet is through a modem or ISDN adapter
with RAS, skip step 1.
<P>
If you have many IPX clients, the following client and server setting
should allow you to autoconfigure your IPX clients:
<P>

<P><h2>TOKEN RING NETWORK WITH NO NETWARE SERVERS</h2>
 
<P>
If you do not have a Novell NetWare server on the network and are using
Token Ring cards on the internal side of the proxy server (or on a computer
running Windows NT server with an internal network number configured), IPX
clients will not autoconfigure their IPX settings correctly. Windows NT
will not respond to the clients RIP broadcasts for the external network
number. This occurs even if an external network number and frame type are
defined on the Windows NT Server computer.
<P>
NOTE: If your connection to the Internet is through a modem or ISDN adapter
with RAS, skip step 1.

</PRE><h3>Troubleshooting IPX Proxy Clients</h3>
 
<P>
If you follow the preceding steps, your IPX clients may still experience
connectivity problems. See the following troubleshooting guide for more
information:
<P>
When you use the command Chkwsp32 /F, you receive one of the following
error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Server Is Down!

   -or-

   Unable to refresh configuration files

</PRE>If the TCP/IP protocol is installed on the client computer but TCP/IP is
not enabled on the proxy server's internal network card, this error will
occur. Some clients on the network may require TCP/IP to be installed for
certain applications or some clients may have Remote Access Services
installed for modem connections with TCP/IP bound to the RAS adapter.
<P>
There are two workarounds for this type of problem:
<P>
Method 1: Remove TCP/IP from the clients.
<P>
Method 2: Force the clients to use only IPX.
<P>
<PRE>   You can force the clients to use only IPX for all Winsock Proxy
   connections. To do this, edit the Mspclnt.ini file on the Proxy server.
   Simply remove the [Servers Ip Addresses] section. The Proxy clients will
   refresh their configuration automatically every six hours, so it is not
   necessary to refresh all of the clients manually.

</PRE>If the Mspclnt share on the proxy server is not accessible, these errors
may also occur. Make sure the client has access to the Mspclnt share on the
proxy server.
<P>
Verify that the client has permissions to this share on the server. If the
client is not a member of the same domain or does not belong to any trusted
domain, do one of the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Move the client configuration files to a share on a server that the
   clients have access to.

   -or-

   Enable the guest account on the Proxy server so that any client will
   have access to the share.

</PRE>NOTE: Click to clear the Enable Access Control check box in the Winsock
Proxy service properties if the clients are not part of the domain that the
proxy server belongs to.
<P>
To move the configuration files, create a share on a server the client has
access to. The server can be a NetWare Server or Windows NT Server. Edit
the Mspclnt.ini file on the proxy server and change the [Master Config]
path to reflect the new location. Copy the Msplat.txt and Mspclnt.ini files
to the new share. Any new clients installed will contain the new location
settings. Click to clear the Enable Access Control check box in the Winsock
Proxy service properties if the clients are not part of the domain that the
proxy server belongs to.
<P>
You receive the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Failed to determine protocol family for Control Channel

</PRE>This error message can occur if the Mspclnt.ini file is missing the
[Servers IPX Addresses] section, or the name of the section is mistyped
(for example, singular instead of plural). Confirm that the section is
present and typed correctly. If it is incorrect, the Mspclnt.ini file on
the server must also be corrected, because the clients periodically update
themselves from the server.
<P>
You find that images or pages are broken or incomplete on the Winsock Proxy
client.
<P>
Try setting the Maximum Connections and Maximum Sockets for the Windows 95
IPX client above the default values. For additional information on this
topic, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
