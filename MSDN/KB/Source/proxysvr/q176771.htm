The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Proxy Server version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are two methods of using Microsoft Exchange Server (or other
Winsock-based server applications) with Proxy Server version 2.0.

<UL><LI>Co-locate the Microsoft Exchange services on the Proxy Server 2.0
   server.

<LI>Install Microsoft Exchange Server on a separate computer located
   on the internal network behind the Proxy Server 2.0 server. Use the
   Server Proxy feature of Proxy 2.0 to redirect the listen() call of
   the Microsoft Exchange services.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Co-locating Microsoft Exchange with Proxy 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
If the Microsoft Exchange services are installed on the Proxy Server,
it will be able to listen for connections from any network interface.
For example, mail clients or SMTP servers on the Internet or intranet
will be able to send and receive mail with the Microsoft Exchange Server.
<P>
If Proxy Server 2.0 packet-filtering feature has been selected (enabled),
all connections from mail clients or servers on the Internet will be
blocked. In fact, all communications except for ICMP requests to and from
the Proxy Server will be blocked. However, applications that use any of
the Proxy services will still be able to communicate with the Internet
with the use of the Proxy Server dynamic packet-filtering feature.
<P>
Because the Microsoft Exchange Server is installed on the Proxy Server
computer, it will not be using the Proxy services to communicate with
the Internet. The communications will be blocked unless a static filter
is enabled on the Proxy packet filter interface for each of the Microsoft
Exchange Server services.
<P>
To create a new packet filter using predefined filter definitions:

<OL><P><LI>In the Security dialog box on the Packet Filters tab, click Add.

<P><LI>In the Packet Filter Properties dialog box, under Allow this Microsoft
   Windows NT Server to Exchange Packets of Type, click Predefined
   filter and select a protocol (in this case, select SMTP).

<P><LI>By default, the predefined filters will allow communication to/from
   ANY host on the Internet. If needed, modify the Local Host and Remote
   Host settings before you click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 1-4 to add the POP and IDENTD filters.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Server Proxy feature allows you to place a server application (such as
FTP, SMTP, POP, or Telnet) on the private network behind the Proxy Server.
With this configuration, the packet filtering features of Microsoft
Proxy Server 2.0 can protect a mail server or other server application.
The application will not require additional valid Internet IP addresses.
<P>
For each Windows Sockets-based application to work through a network
connection, the ports are used in combination with IP addressing to form
a "socketed" connection. The WinSock Proxy service can also redirect a
listen() call, which means that Proxy Server can listen to Internet
requests on behalf of your internal Microsoft Exchange mail server
or other server application and redirect them appropriately.
<P>
For example, if you have bound an internal SMTP/POP server to the proxy,
mail clients, or SMTP servers on the Internet, you can contact this
server by connecting to the Proxy Server's Internet address. To the
outside world, these services will appear to be running on the Proxy
Server itself.
<P>
WARNING: The Server Proxy feature allows an application behind the proxy to
accept connnections from Internet hosts. If the DATA portion of a packet
has been maliciously modified, the application using the server proxy
feature may be vulnerable to attack by a client sending invalid commands
or bad data to the application.
<P>
The Server Proxy feature is covered in detail in the product 
documentation for Microsoft Proxy Server version 2.0. Please see the 
"Configuring Server Proxy Parameters" section in the "Configuring 
Multiserver Environments" chapter.

Proxy Server version 2.0 product documentation "Setting Security
Parameters" chapter.
