<UL><LI>Microsoft Proxy Server versions 1.0 and 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
What is a proxy server? A proxy server is a server configured to act on
behalf of assigned clients. When a client application makes a request for
an object on the Internet, a proxy server on the private network responds
by translating the request and passing it to the Internet. When a computer
on the Internet responds, the proxy server passes that response back to
the client application on the computer that made the request.
<P>
The proxy server is a gateway between the private network and the Internet.
A gateway is special software, or a computer running special software, that
enables two different networks to communicate. The gateway acts as a
barrier
that allows you to make requests to the Internet and receive information,
but does not allow access to your network by unauthorized users.
<P>
<P><h3>The Microsoft Proxy Server</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Proxy Server provides an easy, secure way to bring Internet
access to every desktop in an organization.
<P>
A Proxy Server is software that listens for requests and performs a service
in response. Microsoft Proxy Server listens to the computers on your
private network; when a client application makes a request, Microsoft Proxy
Server responds by translating the request and passing it to the Internet.
When a computer on the Internet responds, Microsoft Proxy Server passes
that response back to the client application on the computer that made the
request.
<P>
Microsoft Proxy Server supports all Internet protocols, including WWW
(HTTP), FTP, RealAudio (streaming audio), VDOLive (streaming video), IRC
(Internet Relay Chat), and mail and news protocols. Support for Novell's
IPX/SPX transport means that deployment of TCP/IP on a private network is
unnecessary. Internet sites can be accessed by Web browsers running on any
operating system, and by all 16-bit and 32-bit Windows Sockets
applications, with no modifications to the applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Advantages of using the Microsoft Proxy Server</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Extend Internet applications to every desktop on your private network.
<P>
   You can use Microsoft Proxy Server to establish access for all of your
   private network clients quickly and easily. Clients can be set up for
   proxy access in minutes. In some cases, Microsoft Proxy Server can also
   eliminate the need to install and support additional protocol drivers
   for each clients desktop.

<LI>Improve performance and access for Internet-based services on your
   private network.
<P>
   Microsoft Proxy Server caches frequently accessed documents to ensure
   the immediate availability of fresh data. Cached copies of popular Web
   pages can be maintained locally and updated automatically, based on a
   study of cache usage. Microsoft Proxy Server also builds upon the high
   performance and scaleability of Microsoft Windows NT Server for
   application services.

<LI>Provide secure access between your private network and the Internet.
<P>
   An administrator can configure Microsoft Proxy Server to grant or deny
   outbound Internet access by user, service, port, or IP domain. Access to
   specific domain sites can be blocked easily. In addition, Microsoft
</UL>Proxy
<PRE>   Server takes advantage of security features built into Windows NT
</PRE>Server.

<UL><LI>Integrate proxy services closely within your current network operating
   system.
<P>
   Microsoft Proxy Server provides tight integration with Windows NT Server
   and Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), resulting in a high
   level of performance and ease of administration.
<P>

documentation included with the software.
