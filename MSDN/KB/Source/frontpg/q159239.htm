The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In FrontPage versions 1.x, if you delete a FrontPage Web using a file
manager other than FrontPage (such as Windows Explorer or File
Manager), the Web name will remain in the list of Webs created by
FrontPage Explorer.
<P>
In all versions of FrontPage, if you delete a FrontPage Web using a
file manager other than FrontPage, the Web server configuration files
retain mapping information to any _vti* directories that were part of
the deleted FrontPage Web.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Using a file management program other than FrontPage is not recommended on
FrontPage Webs. FrontPage Explorer is the only recommended file
management tool for a FrontPage Web.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To delete a Web in FrontPage, open the Web site using FrontPage
Explorer and click Delete FrontPage Web on the File menu.
<P>
If you used a file manager other than FrontPage to delete the web, use
the following steps to manually remove the Web name from the list of
Webs:

<OL><P><LI>In a text editor, such as Notepad, open the Services.cnf file.
<P>
   The Services.cnf file is located in the _vti_pvt directory of the
   server's root Web. Note that this file is different from the
   Service.cnf file (no "s") which occurs in every FrontPage Web.

<P><LI>Find the name of the Web that you want to delete from the list, and
   delete it.

<P><LI>If the web whose name you deleted was in the middle of the list,
   remove the blank line.

<P><LI>Save and close the file.
<P>
</OL>To completely remove the FrontPage Web, you must edit the Web server
configuration files to remove the maps to _vti* directories that were
part of the deleted FrontPage Web. For information about removing maps
to _vti* directories, consult your Web server documentation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
FrontPage Explorer is the best file management tool for a FrontPage
Web. Do not use a different file manager (such as Windows Explorer) to
modify or delete a FrontPage Web.
<P>
FrontPage versions 98 and 97 will detect if a Web directory has been deleted
with a file management tool other than FrontPage and it will not display the Web
in the list of Webs. However, the entry in the Services.cnf and the directory
maps on the Web server will not be deleted. For optimum
performance, you should delete the Web using the steps in the "Workaround"
section of this article.
