The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you publish FrontPage 98 content to a server that has not been upgraded
to the FrontPage 98 server extensions you receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   This FrontPage Web contains new features (themes, shared borders, or
   navigation structure) that can only be edited by FrontPage 98. The
   destination Web server contains an old version of the FrontPage Server
   Extensions that prevents editing this FrontPage Web on that server. You
   can either:

      Publish the FrontPage Web as is, for browsing but not for editing.

      Publish the FrontPage Web without these unsupported features, for
      browsing and editing.

   In either case, the original FrontPage Web will be available for
   editing.

</PRE>If you publish your Web for browsing only you will not be able to open and
delete the Web in FrontPage 98. When you attempt to open the Web you will
receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   This is a browse-only Web. It was originally published from
   &lt;servername&gt;/&lt;webname&gt;. You should make your changes to the original Web
   and publish it again.

</PRE>where &lt;servername&gt; is the name of the Web server from which the Web was
originally published and &lt;webname&gt; is the name of the Web.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To delete the Web, use either of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Open the Web on the FrontPage 97 server and then delete the Web.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Republish the Web to the FrontPage 97 server without the new
   features, open the Web, and then delete it.
<P>
</UL>Additional query words.
