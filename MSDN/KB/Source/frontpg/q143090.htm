<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes what a FrontPage component (WebBot component in Frontpage
97 or earlier versions) is and lists the components that are available in the
versions of FrontPage listed at the beginning of this article. A WebBot
component is a dynamic object on a Web page that is evaluated when the page is
saved or, in some cases, when the page is opened in a Web browser.
<P>
In addition to the components available in earlier versions of FrontPage, the
following new components are available in FrontPage 98:
<P>
<PRE>   Comment
   Hit Counter
   Page Banner
   Banner Ad Manager

</PRE>The following FrontPage components are available in all versions of FrontPage:
<P>
<PRE>   Annotation
   Confirmation Field
   Discussion
   HTML Markup
   Include
   Registration
   Save Results
   Scheduled Image
   Scheduled Include
   Search
   Substitution
   Table of Contents
   Timestamp

</PRE>NOTE: The Annotation component is not available in FrontPage 98.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Comment</h3>
 
<P>
The comment is text that you can view in FrontPage Editor but is hidden when you
open your page in a Web browser. Comment text appears in purple in FrontPage
Editor. It retains the character-size and other attributes of the current
paragraph style.
<P>
<P><h3>Hit Counter</h3>
 
<P>
The Hit Counter is a graphical component that counts the number of times
your Web site has been accessed by other browsers.
<P>
<P><h3>Page Banner</h3>
 
<P>
The Page Banner is a FrontPage component that allows you to place the
title of the page in text or graphical format at the top of the page. You can
use this component with themes and shared borders to add a title to each
page in your Web without having to modify each individual page.
<P>

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : FP98: What are Page Banners?

</PRE><h3>Banner Ad Manager</h3>
 
<P>
The Banner Ad Manager is a FrontPage component that shows each of a series
of designated images for a given number of seconds, then transitions to the
next image using any of several transition effects. The Banner Ad may be
used as advertisement banners or simply to show a series of images.
<P>

</PRE><h3>Annotation</h3>
 
<P>
The Annotation allows you to insert annotations or comments on your
Web page. These annotations can be viewed from FrontPage Editor; they will
not be visible in a Web browser. Annotation text is formatted in purple
in FrontPage Editor. It retains the character size and other
attributes of the current paragraph style.
<P>
<P><h3>Confirmation Field (WebBot Confirmation Field)</h3>
 
<P>
The Confirmation Field is a run-time component that is replaced with the
contents of a form field. It can be used to echo information, such as a user's
name or e-mail address, back to the user as confirmation of the values they
entered in a form. Another use for the Confirmation component is to verify the
name and mailing address of a user who has submitted a form.
<P>
<P><h3>Discussion Form Handler (WebBot Discussion component)</h3>
 
<P>
A Discussion Form Handler (or WebBot Discussion component) allows you to set up
a discussion Web page. The Discussion Form Handler collects information from a
form, formats it into an HTML page, and then adds the page to a table of
contents and to a text index. The Discussion Form Handler gathers information
from the form and stores it in one of a selection of formats, such as HTML or
ASCII text. The Discussion Form Handler is accessed from the Form Properties
dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>HTML Markup Component (WebBot HTML Markup component)</h3>
 
<P>
The HTML Markup Component allows you to enter HTML tags that are not directly
supported or available in FrontPage Editor. For example, FrontPage Editor
versions 1.1 and 1.0 do not include support for table elements or the marquee
element. To enter either of these elements in FrontPage Editor, you must use the
HTML Markup component.
<P>
NOTE: Because FrontPage Editor 1.1 and 1.0 do not support these elements, these
elements will be preserved on export only; they will not be imported. FrontPage
does not verify that your markup is valid HTML.
<P>
<P><h3>Include Page Component (WebBot Include component)</h3>
 
<P>
The Include Page component is designed to replace itself with the contents of
another file. The most common use for the Include Page component is to place the
same text or graphic on every page in a multi-page Web. Examples of items
that you might want to appear on each page in your Web include: copyright
information, headers and footers, and product logos. The Include Page component
requires the URL of the file that contains the text and images to be
included on a page. Any modifications to the source document are
automatically sent to each page for which it is included.
<P>
<P><h3>Registration Form Handler (WebBot Registration component)</h3>
 
<P>
The Registration Form Handler allows you to automatically register users for
access to a service. The WebBot Registration component adds the user to the
services's authentication database; it can then gather information from the
form and store it in one of a selection of formats, such as HTML or ASCII text.
The WebBot Registration is accessed from the Form Properties
dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Save Results Form Handler (WebBot Save Results component)</h3>
 
<P>
The Save Results Form Handler gathers information from a form and stores it in
one of a selection of formats (HTML, ASCII text). When you submit the form,
the Save Results Form Handler appends the form information to a specified file
in a specified format. The Save Results Form Handler is accessed from the Form
Properties dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Scheduled Image (WebBot Scheduled Image component)</h3>
 
<P>
The Scheduled Image component is used when you plan to replace one image with
another within a specific time period. On the expiration date, the original
image is no longer displayed and another image takes its place or the place
where the image existed is left blank.
<P>
When you insert a Scheduled Image component, you will need to enter the name
of the image and any alternate image to be included on the page. The image
must be from the current Web.
<P>
A Scheduled Image component runs when a change is made to your Web. To ensure
proper timing of the Scheduled Image component, make some changes to your Web
daily.
<P>
<P><h3>Scheduled Include Page Component (WebBot Scheduled Include Component)</h3>
 
<P>
The Scheduled Include Page component is used to insert the contents of a file
during a specified period of time. When the time period expires, the
contents of the file are no longer displayed. You can specify an optional
page to be included after a given date.
<P>
A Scheduled Include Page component is run when a change is made to your Web. To
ensure proper timing of the Scheduled Include Page component, make some changes
to your Web daily.
<P>
<P><h3>Search Form (WebBot Search Component)</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Search Form to create a search form. The FrontPage Server
Extensions maintain a list of words found in each page in a Web. If the Web
includes a discussion group, FrontPage also maintains a dynamic list of
words found in each entry of the discussion group. At run-time, the
form created by the Search Form returns a list of pages containing the
words the user entered in the form. The words can include Boolean constructs,
such as and, not, or, and parentheses.
<P>
<P><h3>Substitution Component (WebBot Substitution Component)</h3>
 
<P>
The Substitution component allows you to type an abbreviation
that will be substituted by its expanded form. For example, you can set a
variable, such as HTML, to represent "HyperText Markup Language" (without
the quotation marks). Then, instead of writing out "HyperText Markup
Language," you could type HTML, and HTML will expand to "HyperText Markup
Language" at run-time. You define the variable as a parameter in the Web
Settings dialog box (on the Tools menu, click Web Settings) in
FrontPage Explorer.
<P>
<P><h3>Table of Contents (WebBot Table of Contents Component)</h3>
 
<P>
The Table of Contents component generates an outline of your
Web. The Table of Contents updates this outline each time the Web
content changes. It does not create a table of contents based on bookmarks.
It uses the title element of the subpages to generate the table of
contents.
<P>
<P><h3>Timestamp (WebBot Timestamp Component)</h3>
 
<P>
The Timestamp inserts a date and time stamp that corresponds to the
last time the page was edited or automatically updated.
