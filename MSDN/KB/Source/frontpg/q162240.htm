The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
FrontPage 97 does not provide a user interface that allows you to
delete a disk-based root Web. This article describes how you can
delete a disk-based root Web.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A disk-based root Web is not posted on a Web server. When you view a
disk-based root Web, the FrontPage Explorer title bar shows the
following information:
<P>
<PRE>   FrontPage Explorer - &lt;subweb&gt; (c:\frontpage webs\disk webs\subweb)

</PRE>where &lt;subweb&gt; is the name of the Web. Note that the protocol
(<B>http://)</B> is not included in the title bar.
<P>
Although you can use the Delete FrontPage Web command on the File menu
in FrontPage Explorer, the root Web is not deleted. If you open the
subweb, (for example, c:\frontpage webs\disk webs) and delete it, it
is still listed in the FrontPage Webs list in the Open FrontPage Web
dialog box (File menu) in FrontPage Explorer. If you attempt to delete
the &lt;Root Web&gt; on your subweb, you receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>    Server Error: You cannot delete the root Web from the FrontPage
    Explorer. Use the Server Administrator instead.

</PRE>Note that you receive this error when you attempt to delete any root
Web, whether it is disk-based or server-based. On a server-based Web
you can use the FrontPage Server Administrator to remove the
extensions. There is no similar utility for a disk-based Web.
<P>
To correctly delete a disk-based Web, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Delete all files in the disk location. For example, if your Web is
   located in c:\frontpage webs\disk webs, delete this directory and
   its contents.

<P><LI>(Optional) In a text editor, such as Notepad, open the Fpexplor.ini
   file. This file is located in your \&lt;Windows&gt; directory.

<P><LI>(Optional) Locate the [Recently Opened Servers] section in the
   Fpexplor.ini file and delete the lines that refer to the disk-based
   Web.
<P>
   For example, if the [Recently Opened Servers] section of your
   Fpexplor.ini file looks like this:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Recently Opened Servers]
      Recent Server Count=4
      WebServer0=file:///c:/temp
      WebServer1=carboncopy
      WebServer2=production_Web
      WebServer3=finance_Web
</PRE><P>
   delete the last Web in the list (WebServer3=finance_Web), so that
   the [Recently Opened Servers] section looks like this:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Recently Opened Servers]
      Recent Server Count=3
      WebServer0=carboncopy
      WebServer1=production_Web
      WebServer2=finance_Web
</PRE><P>
   CAUTION: Do not alter the [Recent Web Server] section of the
   Fpexplor.ini. Microsoft recommends that you allow FrontPage
   Explorer to increment the [Recent Web Server] section through
   normal use. For example, after you open four webs, the [Recent Web
   Server] section will contain the correct entries.

<P><LI>(Optional) In the [Recently Opened Servers] section, renumber the
   WebServer entries so that the first entry is WebServer0. Change the
   Recent Server Count value to equal the total number of servers you
   have. The WebServer entries are sequentially numbered from
   WebServer0 to WebServerN where N plus one is used for the value of
   Recent Server Count.
