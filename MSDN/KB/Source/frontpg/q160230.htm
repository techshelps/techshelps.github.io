The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage for the Power Macintosh, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In FrontPage, when you use the User Registration template to create a
page, the WebBot Registration component is set up to save the list of
registered users in a file called Regdb.txt, which is located in the same
folder as the registration page itself.
<P>
This location may lead to security problems if the registration page is
in a browseable directory: the Regdb.txt file will be visible to anyone
who has access to the registration page. Although the Regdb.txt file
does not contain password information, it does contain registered user
names. Although a user name without a password is not an immediate
security risk, the user name is half of the information an unauthorized
person would need to enter your restricted FrontPage Web.
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur in FrontPage 98 because the Regdb.txt file
is stored in the  _private folder.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To protect the confidentiality of user names, store the Regdb.txt file
in the _private folder or some other hidden folder. (Only a
FrontPage author or administrator can browse the _private folder.) As
a further security precaution, you may also want change the name of the
Regdb.txt file.
<P>
<P><h3>Updating the Form Handler When you Move or Rename Regdb.txt</h3>
 
<P>
Use the appropriate method for your version of FrontPage.
<P>
FrontPage 97:
<P>
In FrontPage 97 Explorer folder view, when you drag the Regdb.txt file
to a hidden folder or when you rename it, the form handler will
automatically update the information about the page. If the registration form
is being set up for the first time, this setting should be changed from the
form handler properties.
<P>
FrontPage 1.x:
<P>
Rename the Regdb.txt file to _private/regdb.txt. If you use any other
method to move the file, you may need to alter the Registration WebBot
settings (to do this, modify the form handler properties for the
registration page).
<P>
FrontPage 1.0 for the Power Macintosh:
<P>
In the FrontPage Explorer folder view, when you drag the Regdb.txt file to a
hidden folder or when you rename it, the form handler will automatically
update the information about the page. If the registration form is being set
up for the first time, this setting should be changed from the form handler
properties.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft 
FrontPage 98 for Windows.
