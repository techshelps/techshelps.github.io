The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, version 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run FrontPage Server Extensions on a Netscape Server, if you
were to monitor the network traffic between FrontPage and the server you
would notice that the communication is not encoded. Encoding can safely
be restored to communication between the FrontPage client and the Netscape
server when the server is running on a UNIX platform.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To restore encoding between the FrontPage client and the FrontPage Server 
Extensions for Netscape servers on a UNIX platform, add the following section to 
the Frontpg.ini file (located in the Windows or Windows NT directory):
<P>
<PRE>   [Web Extender Client]
   Encrypt=true

</PRE>NOTE: If the FrontPage.ini file includes the above modifications, you
will not be able to run the FrontPage Server Extensions on the Netscape servers
on a Windows NT system.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft 
FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack. FrontPage 97 communicates with 
Netscape Commerce or Netscape Enterprise servers by using Secure Sockets Layer 
(SSL) technology. This solution offers maximum security. Without SSL, FrontPage 
97 exhibits these same symptoms.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Encrypt=true value in the Frontpg.ini re-enables the default encoding
of messages between the FrontPage client and the Web server. Although
users of the FrontPage Extensions on a Netscape server on a UNIX platform
will not notice any errors without this modification, adding this
modification to their Frontpg.ini file will increase the security of their
transactions with the server. FrontPage detects Netscape servers
automatically by looking at the HTTP headers returned by the server.
