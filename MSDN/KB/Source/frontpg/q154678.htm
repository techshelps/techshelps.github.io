<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, version 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Copy Web command to copy an existing Web to a remote
Web site, you may receive one of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>An unexpected Web Extender error occurred on the server. Authors-
   please contact the Webmaster for this server's site. WebMasters-
   please see the server's logs for more details.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Poorly formed http response.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Copy Web command to connect the FrontPage client to a
server, the Web Server will create a process to serve that request.
Once the client's account is validated, the client will use HyperText
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to communicate with Author.exe on your server.
Author.exe works as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) script within the
process generated by the Web server.
<P>
Web servers enforce a time-out period on any process in order to
protect the server from being overloaded. On most servers, this time-
out period varies. When the connection speed between the client and
the server is slow and the size of the Web to be transferred is large,
the server may stop serving FrontPage before the transfer is complete.
<P>
NOTE: There have been unconfirmed reports that the first error occurs when
you attempt to open a Web on the FrontPage Personal Web Server after you
install FrontPage 97 over FrontPage 1.1. It has been reported that you can
resolve this problem by removing and reinstalling the FrontPage 97 Server
Extensions on FrontPage Personal Web Server.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the limitations of the time-out period, use any of the
following methods:

<UL><LI>Get a faster modem. A 28.8 (28,800 bits per second [bps]) modem is
   twice as fast as a 14.4 modem.

<LI>Use sub-Webs instead of a root Web to avoid creating Webs whose
   transfer speed exceeds the time-out period.

<LI>Create the Web remotely, on your staging server, in order to avoid
   having to transfer the Web.

<LI>Use the FrontPage Publishing Wizard to transfer your Web, and then
   recalculate the links on the Web when it reaches the server.
<P>
   The FrontPage Publishing Wizard initiates an FTP session to your
   server and automates the transfer of FrontPage Webs using FTP. FTP
   is not subject to the same time-out limitations as HTTP and can
   often move data more reliably. In addition, the Publishing Wizard
   allows you to transfer only the files that have been changed since
   the last post, resulting in less data transferred. The FrontPage
   Publishing Wizard can be set to transfer all files or some files
   in the Web.
<P>
   To obtain the FrontPage Publishing Wizard for FrontPage 97, please
   see the following Microsoft World Wide Web site:

</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The formula to calculate the time-out period is as follows
<P>
<PRE>   Seconds to transfer = Web size/modem speed

</PRE>where "Web size" is the total bits of data that makes up the Web and "modem
speed" is the speed, in bits per second (bps), that the modem uses to
transfer data. (For example, 14,400 bps or 28,800 bps.)
<P>
<PRE>   (Web in K * 1024) * (8{Bits} + 4{bits overhead}) = (Web in K * 12288)

</PRE>The following is a sample table showing transfer times in seconds.
<P>
<PRE>                                   File Size
                 500K      1000K    5000K     10000K   20000K
                 --------------------------------------------
   14,400 bps    427        854     4267       8534    17067
   28,800 bps    214        427     2134       4267     8534

</PRE>NOTE: When you calculate the size of the Web, you must include data in
all folders in the Web to be copied, not just the static HTML files.
In addition, note that connection speeds are frequently slower than
the maximum speed of the modem.
