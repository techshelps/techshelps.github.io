The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to access an existing Web site, you may receive the
following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to open <B>http://&lt;servername&gt;/&lt;page&gt;.</B> The site reports
   that the item you requested could not be found.

   404 Not Found.
   The requested URL /page was not found on the server.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because FrontPage cannot find the page. This
problem will occur for any of the following reasons:

<UL><LI>You typed the address incorrectly.

<LI>The proxy server setting in FrontPage Explorer is invalid.

<LI>You are trying to follow a link created by the following
   WebBot components:
<P>
<PRE>      Microsoft FrontPage 98            Microsoft FrontPage 97
                                        Microsoft FrontPage 1.0, 1.1
      --------------------------------------------------------------
      Confirmation Field                WebBot Confirmation component
      Discussion Form Handler           WebBot Discussion component
      Registration Form Handler         WebBot Registration component
      Save Results Form Handler         WebBot Save Results component
      Search Form                       WebBot Search component
      Hit Counter

   These are browse-time components, which require the server
   extensions to be installed in order to work. The links are valid,
   but the browser is unable to find the corresponding page until the
   server extensions are installed.

</PRE><LI>The Web folder was deleted.

<LI>The Web content was moved.

<LI>The server configuration file was moved.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the appropriate method for your
situation.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: If You Typed the Address Incorrectly</h3>
 
<P>
Check to make sure you typed the Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
correctly. If it is incorrect, retype the URL correctly and try again.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: If the Proxy Server Is Invalid</h3>
 
<P>
FrontPage Explorer allows you to specify a proxy server. To verify
that this server is correct, use the step appropriate to your version
of FrontPage:

<UL><LI>FrontPage 98 or 97: On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the
   Proxies tab.

<LI>FrontPage 1.1 or 1.0: On the Tools menu, click Proxy.
<P>
</UL>If the Proxy address is correct, confirm that the proxy is functioning
properly.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3: If You Are Using Browse-time FrontPage or WebBot Components</h3>
 
<P>
The browse-time FrontPage components require the FrontPage Server
Extensions to function. If the FrontPage Server Extensions are not
installed on the Web server, the Web server administrator must run the
FrontPage Server Administrator and install the appropriate server
extensions to the Web server you are using.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 4: If the Web Folder Was Deleted</h3>
 
<P>
If you deleted the folder that contains all your Web pages, FrontPage
still maintains pointers to that information in another file. For
information about how to completely remove all references to the
deleted Web, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../FRONTPG/Q143324.htm">Q143324</A></B>
   TITLE     : FP: HTTP Error 404 Opening Deleted Web

</PRE><h3>Method 5: If the Web Content Was Moved</h3>
 
<P>
If you moved your content from its original location, move it back,
start the Server Administrator, uninstall the server extensions, and
then move the content where you want it and reinstall the FrontPage
Server Extensions.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 6: If the Server Configuration File Was Moved</h3>
 
<P>
Check the path to your current server configuration file. To do this,
use the FrontPage Server Administrator or look in the Frontpg.ini file
(this file should be located in the Windows directory).
<P>
For the FrontPage Personal Web Server, the path to the FrontPage Server
Extensions configuration file should be as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Version 98, 97, 1.1   FrontPage Webs\Server\conf\httpd.cnf
   Version 1.0           Vermeer\Httpd\Conf\httpd.cnf

</PRE>If this path does not point to a valid file, put the files back into
place. If you want to move the server configuration file, use the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Uninstall the FrontPage Server Extensions.

<P><LI>Move the configuration file.

<P><LI>Re-install the server extensions.
<P>
</OL>If you are using the Microsoft Personal Web Server, which is shipped
with the FrontPage 97 Bonus Pack or FrontPage 98, it is essential that the
WebShare and WebSvr directories are in the location referred to by the
Directories tab of the WWW Administrator. For more information about
configuring the Microsoft Personal Web Server, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
