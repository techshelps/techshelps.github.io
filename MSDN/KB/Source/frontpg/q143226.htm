<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists the HTML extensions that the FrontPage Editor reads and
writes. It also identifies deviations from the standard.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>BASEFONT     Although the FrontPage Editor reads the BASEFONT tag, it
             exports this tag as a FONT tag, which includes a SIZE
             attribute that specifies an absolute size. See also
             the entry for the FONT tag.

BLINK        The FrontPage Editor reads and writes the BLINK tag. Note
             that the FrontPage Editor displays text surrounded by BLINK
             tags in green.

BODY         The FrontPage Editor reads and writes the BACKGROUND
             (background image), BGCOLOR (background color), TEXT (text
             color), LINK (anchor color), VLINK (visited anchor color),
             and ALINK (active anchor color) attributes on the BODY tag.

             NOTE: There is currently no way to modify the ALINK
             attribute.

CENTER       The FrontPage Editor reads the CENTER tag. Note that the
             CENTER tag is not interpreted as a paragraph break on
             import. If a CENTER tag is encountered in a paragraph, the
             whole paragraph is centered.

             The FrontPage Editor exports the CENTER tag in the following
             ways:

              - When the CENTER tag includes a P, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, or
                H6 tag, the FrontPage Editor writes the tag with the
                ALIGN=CENTER attribute. For example,

                  &lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;

              - When the Editor encounters a CENTER tag within the
                ADDRESS, PRE, LI, DD, or DT tags, the CENTER tag is
                exported.

DFN            The FrontPage Editor reads and writes the DFN tag, which
               marks text as a defining instance.

DIR            According to the HTML 2.0 specification, DIR lists should
               exclude all block elements (paragraphs, lists, for
               example) from their content. This means that nested DIR
               elements are not allowed. The FrontPage editor removes
               this restriction. DIR lists are treated like OL and UL
               elements. See also the entry for the MENU tag.

FONT           The FrontPage Editor reads and writes the font size
               attributes of the FONT tag, using sizes from 1 through 7.
               Both the relative size (for example, size=+3) and the
               absolute size (for example, size=6) attributes are read,
               but only the absolute size attribute is exported. See
               also the entry for the BASEFONT tag.

H1, H2, H3,    The HTML 2.0 specification states that the heading tags
H4, H5, H6     should not be allowed anywhere except the BODY, a
               BLOCKQUOTE, or a FORM tag. Because this is restrictive,
               and would disallow such common usage as heading tags in
               side list elements, the FrontPage Editor allows the
               heading tags anywhere a paragraph (P) is allowed.

HR             The FrontPage Editor reads and writes the HR attributes
               defined by Netscape. The SIZE, WIDTH, ALIGN, and NOSHADE
               attributes can all be modified.

IMG            The FrontPage Editor reads and writes several of the
               extended IMG attributes, including BORDER, HSPACE, and
               VSPACE, as defined by Netscape. The WIDTH and HEIGHT
               attributes, interpreted as numbers of pixels, are used to
               approximate the size of an image being fetched by the
               Editor. They are exported using the current width and
               height measurements of the image.

               The new values for the ALIGN attribute (TEXTTOP,
               ABSMIDDLE, ABSBOTTOM, BASELINE, LEFT, and RIGHT) are
               imported and exported, although LEFT and RIGHT are not
               rendered in true WYSIWYG.

MENU           According to the HTML 2.0 specification, MENU lists
               should exclude all block elements (paragraphs, lists,
               and so on) from their content. This means that nested
               MENU lists are not allowed. The FrontPage Editor removes
               this restriction. MENU lists are treated like OL and UL
               elements. See also the entry for the DIR tag.

PRE            Old versions of the HTML 2.0 specification implied that
               preformatted paragraphs could only contain text,
               horizontal rules, line breaks, and anchors. No browser
               makes these restrictions, so the FrontPage Editor allows
               you to include in the PRE element all elements that are
               allowed within the P element.

STRIKE         The FrontPage Editor reads and writes the STRIKE tag,
               which marks text as struck out. This tag was a proposed
               tag in earlier versions of the HTML 2.0 specification,
               and is supported in many browsers. It has been
               superseded in the HTML 3.0 draft specification by the S
               tag.

U              The FrontPage Editor reads and writes the U tag, which
               marks text as underlined. This tag was a proposed tag in
               earlier versions of the HTML 2.0 specification, and is
               supported in some browsers. It is in the HTML 3.0 draft
               specification.
