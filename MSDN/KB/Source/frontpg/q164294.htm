The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack
<LI>Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, version 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to change the ServerName of the FrontPage
Personal Web Server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
ServerName affects the name the server returns to a client. For
example, if a Web browser requests <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage">http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage,</A></B>
the server redirects that to <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/">http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/</A></B> (with
a trailing slash) so that relative links are interpreted correctly.
The server does not know the name that was sent in the original
request (without the trailing slash), so it typically uses the host
name as returned by the Transport Control Protocol (TCP).
<P>
This can lead to problems in three cases:

<UL><LI>Your machine is known by multiple names and you want to control
   which name is returned. (for example, mail.example.com and
   www.example.com)

<LI>Your TCP is configured incorrectly so the server cannot determine
   its server name.

<LI>You are using the FrontPage 1.0 Personal Web Server (PWS), and your
   hostname is not qualified (does not contain any dots). The original
   PWS would reject nonqualified domain names because they would be
   misinterpreted if they were sent outside the local domain.
<P>
</UL>The recommended solution to case 2 above is to fix your TCP/IP
configuration. As an interim workaround, you might change the
ServerName, but this is not preferred and will lead to problems on a
networked machine.
<P>
Use the following steps to change the ServerName for the FrontPage
Personal Web Server:

<OL><P><LI>Using a text editor, such as Notepad, open the Httpd.cnf file. This
   file is located in the c:\FrontPage Webs\Server\conf subdirectory.
<P>
   In FrontPage 1.0, this file is located in the C:\Vermeer\http\conf
   subdirectory.

<P><LI>Locate the section which describes the ServerName directive.
   It looks like this:
<P>
<P><PRE>      # ServerName allows you to set a host name that is sent back to
      # clients for your server. If it's different than the one the
      # program would get (i.e. use "www" instead of the host's real
      # name). Make sure your DNS is set up to alias the name to your
      # system!
      #
      # Format: ServerName &lt;domain_name&gt;
      #
      # no default
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ServerName &lt;domain_name&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;domain_name&gt; is the name of your domain.
<P>
   NOTE: The server name cannot contain spaces.
<P>
   If you are naming your server "localhost" (without the quotation
   marks), type this line so that it looks like this:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ServerName localhost
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save and close the file.
<P>
</OL>Restart the FrontPage Personal Web Server. It will respond to the name
you typed in step 3.
<P>
NOTE: If your computer does not have DNS enabled and your TCP/IP stack
supports it, you can use "localhost" (without the quotation marks) as
your computer name without having to make the changes described in
this article. You will also be able to specify "localhost" if your
computer has a host name that is not fully qualified. To determine if
your TCP/IP stack supports this configuration, run the FrontPage 1.1
TCP/IP test. In FrontPage 98 and 97, start the FrontPage Explorer, click
About Microsoft FrontPage Explorer on the Help menu, and then click
Network Test.
