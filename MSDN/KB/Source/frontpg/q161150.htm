<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the differences between the FrontPage Personal
Web Server and the Microsoft Personal Web Server.
<P>
NOTE: Both Web servers are designed for low volume personal or intranet
use. Neither is recommended as a commercial or corporate Web server. The
Microsoft Personal Web Server offers features that programmers need to
use in order to create ISAPI programs or to access databases using IDC
technology.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>FrontPage Personal Web Server</h3>
 
<P>
The FrontPage Personal Web Server is the personal Web server that
ships with FrontPage 1.0 and FrontPage 1.1. It is a direct descendant
of NCSA 1.3, ported from UNIX to Microsoft Windows. It supports only
standard input/output CGI and the FrontPage Server Extensions. It is a
Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) server only. It is configurable
through the manipulation of text files in the "conf" subdirectory of the
server installation directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Personal Web Server</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Personal Web Server includes a Hypertext Transport
Protocol (HTTP) and a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. The Microsoft
Personal Web Server is fully integrated into the Windows 95 taskbar and
Control Panel, which allows you to start and stop HTTP and FTP services,
to administer the server, or to change general options.
<P>
The Microsoft Personal Web Server includes an HTML-based administration
utility that also supports full remote administration from a Web
browser. It supports both user-level and local security. Users can set
up the Microsoft Personal Web Server to support Windows NT
Challenge/Response (NTLM) encrypted-password transmission. The Microsoft
Personal Web Server's support for NTLM allows remote FrontPage authors
and administrators to be validated by their network logon username and
password within the context of a Windows NT network, bypassing the need
to re-enter this information when authoring. The Microsoft Personal Web
Server disables security when authoring locally so you will not be
prompted for your name and password as long as you are running FrontPage
from the same computer where the Microsoft Personal Web Server is
installed.
<P>
Microsoft Personal Web Server fully supports existing standards such as
CGI and includes the open Internet Server API (ISAPI) extension to the
Win32 API which is up to five times faster than CGI-based applications.
Microsoft Personal Web Server also supports simple database access
through the Internet Database Connector (IDC).
