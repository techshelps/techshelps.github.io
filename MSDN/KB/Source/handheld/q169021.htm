<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to transfer a file from your Handheld PC (H/PC) to your 
desktop computer using H/PC Explorer, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not transfer one or more of the selected file(s) to the specified
   destination.

   A temporary folder will be created containing temporary copies of these
   files. A shortcut called "Handheld PC Recovered Files" will be placed 
   on the Windows Desktop.

   Warning: The temporary files will be deleted upon the next error of 
   this type. To avoid having these files permanently deleted, you should
   immediately copy these temporary files to another folder. The folder 
   will now be opened, please copy the files to another folder at this 
   time.

following target locations:
