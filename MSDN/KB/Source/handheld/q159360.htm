The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows CE version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to configure Windows CE to connect to the
Internet using Remote Networking.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows CE has built-in support for connecting to an Internet service
provider (ISP) using a PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) account. SLIP support
is not available; TCP/IP is the only protocol supported by Windows CE.
<P>
<P><h3>Getting Started</h3>
 
<P>
To connect to the Internet, you need a PPP account with an ISP. You also
need the following information from your ISP:

<UL><LI>User name
<LI>Password
<LI>Local access phone number
<LI>Your host and domain name
<LI>DNS server IP address
<LI>Authentication technique (whether or not a terminal window is used)
<P>
</UL>Your ISP may also supply you with an IP address if you use a dedicated IP
address every time you dial in.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Create and Configure a New Connection</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Tap the Start button, tap Programs, and then double-tap Communications.

<P><LI>Double-tap Remote Networking, and then double-tap Make New Connection.

<P><LI>Type the name of your ISP in the "Type a name for the connection"
   box, tap Dial-up Connection, and then tap Next.

<P><LI>Tap your modem in the Select A Modem box, and then type your ISP's
   phone number.

<P><LI>If your ISP requires you to manually log in to your PPP account after
   you connect, tap Configure. On the Port Settings tab, tap the Use
   Terminal Window After Dialing check box so that it is selected, and
   then tap OK.

<P><LI>Tap TCP/IP Settings. Enter your DNS server address and the proper
   settings for your IP address, and then tap OK. If you are unsure of
   these settings, contact your ISP.

<P><LI>Tap Finish. Once the connection is created, an icon appears in the
   Remote Networking folder. Double-tap the icon to connect to the
   Internet.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Connect to Your PPP Account</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Tap the Start button, tap Programs, and then double-tap Communications.

<P><LI>Double-tap Remote Networking, and then double-tap the connection's
   icon.

<P><LI>In the Connect To dialog box, enter the appropriate information, and
   then tap Connect.
<P>
   If you selected the Use Terminal Window After Dialing check box, enter
   you logon information when the terminal window appears. After you enter
   your user name and password, tap Continue. The order in which you log
   in and the information you have to provide may vary for your ISP.
   Please contact your provider if you have any questions about the logon
   procedure.
<P>
</OL>After the Connected To dialog box appears, you are connected to the
Internet.
