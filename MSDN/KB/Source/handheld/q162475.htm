The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows CE version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to perform an action on your Handheld PC (H/PC), you may
receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Program memory is very low. You must select at least one task to close,
   or increase the amount of program memory, if available.

</PRE>If you attempt to close a file with unsaved information, you may
experience one or more of the following symptoms:

<UL><LI>Your H/PC stops responding. Although Task Manager may open when you
   press CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE, your H/PC may not be able to close programs
   and refresh the screen properly.

<LI>You are prompted to save your changes. If you attempt to save the file,
   you receive the following message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The application is not responding. It may be busy or waiting for a
      response from you. Press Wait to give the application time to
      respond or to get a response from you. Press End Task to close the
      application immediately. All unsaved data will be lost. Press Choose
      to select another application or document to close.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is not enough available program memory for Windows CE to perform the
attempted action, to save the file, or to display the appropriate dialog
boxes.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, use one or more of the following methods:

<UL><LI>When you receive the "Program memory is very low" error message, close
   a program or a file that does not need to be saved.

<LI>Tap the "Convert 20K of Storage Memory to Program Memory" check box to
   select it, and then tap OK. This may free up enough memory to save the
   changes to your unsaved file.
<P>
   NOTE: You may need to perform this step several times, until enough
   program memory is available.

<LI>Increase available program memory. To do so, follow these steps:
<P>
   1. Tap the Start button, tap Settings, and then double-tap System.
<P>
   2. Tap the Memory tab, move the slider to the left, and then tap OK.
<P>
   NOTE: Do not move the slider all the way to the left, as this may cause
   a lack of available storage memory.

<LI>If you receive an "Application is not responding" error message, tap
   End Task.
<P>
   NOTE: Tapping End Task may result in data loss.

<LI>Press the reset button on your H/PC. Any unsaved information will be
   lost.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you reset your H/PC, temporary files may remain on your H/PC. Microsoft
Pocket Word files usually have a .tmp extension and are saved in the My
Documents folder. Microsoft Pocket Excel files are usually saved in the
root folder as Temp&lt;x&gt;.pxl, where &lt;x&gt; is the number of the temporary file.
For more information about dealing with temporary files on your H/PC, see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
