<P>
Q. What is Windows CE?
<P>
A. Microsoft Windows CE is an open, scalable Windows platform for a
<PRE>   broad range of communications, entertainment and mobile-computing
   devices. The standards-based Windows CE platform is an entirely new
   operating system built from the ground up to make possible new
   categories of business and consumer non-PC devices that can
   communicate with each other, share information with Windows-based
   PCs, and connect to the Internet.

</PRE>Q. Why did Microsoft develop Windows CE?
<P>
A. For the past few years, Microsoft has outlined its vision of
<PRE>   'Information At Your Fingertips,' in which the idea of a personal
   computer on every desk and in every home evolved into one of
   computer-based devices in a variety of business and consumer
   environments. The Windows CE operating system is the result of a
   multiyear development effort to fulfill that vision. With Windows
   CE, Microsoft is providing an open, standards-based platform that
   will significantly lower the hurdles for OEMs, hardware
   manufacturers, software developers, and, ultimately, customers to
   adopt new non-PC technologies and solutions.

</PRE>Q. What new products is Microsoft planning, or does Microsoft envision,
<PRE>   based on Windows CE?

</PRE>A. The first products based on Windows CE will be a new category of
<PRE>   mobile companion devices for Windows-based PCs called handheld PCs,
   or H/PCs. H/PCs are designed to provide the millions of mobile
   professionals using Windows-based personal computers an affordable,
   easy-to-use, PC companion to carry their most important information
   when they are away from their PC. Additional categories of devices
   that Windows CE would be suitable for include other small form-
   factor mobile-computing devices such as "wallet" PCs, wireless
   communications devices such as digital information pagers and
   cellular smart phones, next-generation multimedia and entertainment
   consoles including DVD players, and purpose-built Internet access
   devices such as Internet TVs, digital set-top boxes and Internet
   "Web phones."

</PRE>Q. When will products based on Windows CE become available?
<P>
A. Microsoft expects to announce the availability of H/PC devices,
<PRE>   third-party software applications and H/PC peripherals at this
   year's COMDEX show in Las Vegas. Microsoft will continue to work
   with many of its existing partners and will be forming new
   relationships to extend the benefits of the Windows CE platform
   across additional product categories.

</PRE>Q. What are your plans for Windows CE and the Internet?
<P>
A. Our strategy is to build Internet access into the Windows platform,
<PRE>   whether it is the Windows NT, Windows 95, or Windows CE operating
   system. Windows CE includes a version of Microsoft Internet
   Explorer, offering built-in Web access for new and existing
   categories of non-PC business and consumer devices.

</PRE>Q. What are the components of Windows CE?
<P>
A. The Windows CE operating system is a 32-bit, multitasking,
<PRE>   multithreaded operating system that has an open architecture design
   that enables a variety of devices. Windows CE is compact, providing
   high performance in low memory conditions and is scalable, allowing
   for a range of embedded, mobile or multimedia product lines.
   Windows CE also has the advantage of being portable, providing
   choice in microprocessors and has integrated power management,
   enabling long battery life on mobile devices. Standard
   communications support is built into Windows CE, enabling access
   to the Internet to send and receive e-mail or browse the World Wide
   Web. In addition, a graphical user interface, incorporating many
   elements of the familiar Windows user interface, will be available
   on certain devices, facilitating ease of use for the end user.

</PRE>Q. How is Microsoft's strategy for Windows CE different from the non-
<PRE>   PC strategies of other software developers?

</PRE>A. Microsoft's strategy for Windows CE is to provide an open,
<PRE>   standards-based platform that will enable OEMs, hardware
   manufacturers, and software developers to develop new categories
   of communications, entertainment and mobile-computing products
   that can "talk" to each other and share information with Windows-
   based PCs - in addition to providing access to the Internet.

</PRE>Q. Will customers be able to acquire Windows CE?
<P>
A. Windows CE will be a licensed platform for OEMs similar to Windows
<PRE>   95 and Windows NT. Microsoft has no plans to offer Windows CE
   through retail channels.

</PRE>Q. What is the H/PC?
<P>
A. H/PCs, or handheld PCs, are a new category of mobile companion
<PRE>   devices for Windows-based PCs based on Microsoft's Windows CE
   platform. H/PCs have been designed to provide the millions of
   mobile professionals using Windows-based personal computers an
   affordable, easy-to-use, mobile handheld PC companion to carry
   their most important data when they are away from their personal
   computer.

</PRE>Q. Why did Microsoft decide to enter into this new product category?
<P>
A. Microsoft has conducted extensive customer research indicating that
<PRE>   there is a significant market of millions of mobile professionals
   using Windows-based PCs who are looking for an affordable,
   convenient and easy-to-use PC "companion" to carry their most
   important information when they are away from their personal
   computers. These customers want an easy way to "sync up"
   information when returning to their desks, and they want a system
   with nothing new to learn - one that complements their existing
   applications for Windows and works with their personal information
   management (PIM) software. Microsoft believes a great opportunity
   exists to provide these customers an easy-to-use, full-featured
   mobile PC companion that builds on their knowledge of Windows.

</PRE>Q. What are H/PCs' main features and benefits?
<P>
A. H/PCs have been designed to provide the millions of mobile
<PRE>   professionals using personal computers running Windows an
   affordable, easy-to-use mobile PC companion to carry their most
   important information when they are away from their personal
   computer. H/PCs running Microsoft Windows CE provide an easy-to-
   learn user interface incorporating many elements of the familiar
   Windows user interface, come equipped with companion applications
   that work with the PIM and productivity applications customers know
   and use every day, and provide seamless information synchronization
   with Windows-based PCs. Standard communications support is also
   built into Windows CE, enabling users to access the Internet to
   send and receive e-mail or browse the World Wide Web. Moreover,
   Windows CE provides a standard development environment that ensures
   the emergence of a strong aftermarket for H/PC companion
   applications.

</PRE>Q. What do H/PCs look like? How big are they? What do they weigh?
<P>
A. H/PCs are designed to be "pocketable," easily accessible mobile
<PRE>   devices the user feels comfortable taking everywhere. Although OEMs
   are responsible for the design of their individual products, all
   H/PCs will have certain characteristics, including a "clamshell"
   design, an LCD screen and a standard keyboard. Most H/PCs will
   weigh-in under one pound.

</PRE>Q. How is the H/PC different from a laptop or a notebook computer?
<P>
A. The H/PC is a mobile PC companion and is designed to complement,
<PRE>   note replace, desktop, laptop and notebook computers. Companion
   applications developed for the H/PC are not intended to replace the
   functionality of personal computer applications but instead are
   intended to extend and augment those desktop applications.

</PRE>Q. How is the H/PC different from a PDA?
<P>
A. The H/PC is not a PDA, but rather an affordable handheld PC
<PRE>   companion. The H/PC concept was developed through extensive
   customer research that concluded that a device to extend the
   capabilities of a PC user when away from their desk was extremely
   valuable. PDAs can generally be classified as stand-alone,
   keyboardless devices with proprietary user interfaces and
   applications that require pen-based entry and navigation.
   Typically, PDAs have been expensive, with price points close to,
   or in excess of, $1,000. For the most part, these devices have been
   unaffordable, too big and too heavy, and haven't featured simple
   companionship with desktop or notebook PCs necessary to convince a
   substantial number of mobile professionals to adopt them. Early
   indications are that the H/PC concept will be successful at meeting
   the needs and solving real customer problems.

</PRE>Q. How is the H/PC different from an electronic organizer?
<P>
A. H/PCs come equipped with much more than just personal information
<PRE>   management software. In addition to the Microsoft Windows CE
   operating system, H/PCs come with companion productivity
   applications, an e-mail client and an Internet browser. Standard
   communications support is also built in to Windows CE, enabling
   H/PCs to access the Internet for sending and receiving e-mail or
   browsing the World Wide Web.

</PRE>Q. What is Microsoft's contribution to the H/PC?
<P>
A. Microsoft produces the Windows CE operating system and a suite of
<PRE>   standard applications, all of which will run on hardware designed
   and produced by OEMs. Microsoft also brings its proven ability to
   create viable product platforms and then enable third parties to
   build products around them.

</PRE>Q. Who will manufacture H/PC products?
<P>
A. The following leading computer and consumer electronics OEMs have
<PRE>   announced their commitment to developing and manufacturing H/PCs:
   Casio Computer Co., Hewlett-Packard Co., LG Electronics, NEC Corp.
   and Philips Electronics.

</PRE>Q. When will H/PC products be available?
<P>
A. Microsoft expects to announce the availability of H/PC devices,
<PRE>   third-party software applications, and H/PC peripherals at this
   year's COMDEX show in Las Vegas.

</PRE>Q. What companion applications will come with the H/PC?
<P>
A. H/PCs will come with a standard suite of applications from
<PRE>   Microsoft, including a personal information manager, an e-mail
   client, and productivity companion applications. H/PCs also will
   come equipped with a version of Microsoft Internet Explorer.
   Moreover, Windows CE provides a standard development environment
   that ensures a strong aftermarket will develop for additional H/PC
   applications, including companions to popular desktop applications
   as well as applications in vertical markets that specifically
   address certain mobile user segments.

</PRE>Q: What support is offered for Microsoft Pocket Excel and Microsoft
<PRE>   Pocket Word?

</PRE>A: The hardware vendor provides support for all Windows CE applications
<PRE>   and the H/PC hardware. Microsoft offers paid support for Pocket Excel
   and Pocket Word on a callback basis.
