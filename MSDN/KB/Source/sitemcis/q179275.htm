The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Commercial Internet System, version 1.0
   - Microsoft Content Replication System

<LI>Microsoft Site Server, version 2.0
   - Microsoft Content Replication System
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Automatic replication by the Microsoft Content Replication System (CRS)
appears to stop and does not replicate any files even after the files are
changed or touched.
<P>
CRS attempts to replicate the file five times, waiting for 30 seconds
between each retry. After five attempts, CRS ends the replication with the
following error message in the Windows NT Application log:
<P>
<PRE>   MessageId=15130
   CRS was unable to replicate the file %1 because it was inaccessible.

</PRE>%1 includes an (rc=xx) code that is the Windows NT helpmsg number that
denotes why the file was inaccessible. To determine the condition of the
file that caused the error, from a command prompt enter:
<P>
<PRE>   net helpmsg xx

</PRE>where "xx" is the code from the error message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This can be caused by one or more corrupt files. CRS may have been notified
that the file was changed, but corruption in the file may disable CRS from
opening it. CRS interprets its inability to open the file as the file being
locked. The normal behavior of CRS for addressing locked files in automatic
mode is to wait until the lock is cleared. Because of this, CRS continues
to wait on the corrupted file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Commercial
Internet System version 1.0 and Site Server version 2.0. This problem has
been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Site Server 2.0 Service
Pack 1. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
