The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Site Server, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The IP Resolution feature of Usage Analyst SQL may fail to resolve all IP
addresses to host names. Resolution failure is more likely to occur when a
small number of IP addresses have been imported from a log file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem is in the method used to identify resolved host names from the
IP addresses in the SQL database.
<P>
Usage Analyst writes IP addresses to the SQL database table when a log file
is imported. Usage Analyst then parses this table for unresolved IP
addresses when IP Resolution is performed. After parsing out unresolved IP
addresses, Usage Analyst attempts to resolve all the IP addresses and
writes the host names to another SQL database table.
<P>
In this case, Usage Analyst IP Resolution is failing because it does not
update the SQL database with host names if all the attempts to resolve IP
addresses succeed. The only time the SQL database is correctly updated with
host names is if at least one of the IP addresses fails resolution.
<P>
The problem is less likely to occur after a large log file import because
it improves the chance that one of the IP addresses from the log file will
fail to resolve.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. With the
hotfix, Import.exe was modified to update the SQL database with host names
when IP Resolution succeeds for all IP addresses.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Site Server
version 2.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
