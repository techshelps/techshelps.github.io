<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Performance Monitor to remotely monitor a computer, you may
receive a STOP 0xC000021A error message during normal operation sometime
after you install the Microsoft Windows NT Service Pack 3 (SP3).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Performance Monitor to remotely monitor a computer, the
initiating computer attaches to the target computer's Winlogon process via
RPC. The Winlogon process has a perflib component in it for collecting
data. The shared data is passed from the performance DLL to Winlogon on the
target computer. The performance DLLs sometimes function incorrectly and
overwrite their buffers. In the case of remote monitoring, this overwrite
occurs in the context of the Winlogon process on the target computer,
causing an access violation to occur. This compromises the Winlogon
subsystem (security is then potentially breached) which forces Windows NT
to jump into kernel and bugcheck.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Fix the extensible performance counter so that it does not overwrite its
buffers.
<P>
The performance DLLs export (make available to other modules) three
functions: Open, Collect, and Close. For more information, see "Creating
the Performance DLL" in the Win32 SDK documentation.
<P>
NOTE: Usually the Collect function causes the above problem.
<P>
As another workaround, you can configure Windows NT to write a guard page
on either side of the shared memory buffer with various levels of checking.
This technology was enabled by default up to SP3, but caused too many page
faults for large counters, significantly degrading system performance. In
SP3, the guard pages and checking are turned off by default.
<P>
To enable this guard page technology, create the value under the registry
sub-key using the following procedure.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and go to the following sub-key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Perflib

   Value: ExtCounterTestLevel
   Type: REG_DWORD
   Data: 2

   The ExtCounterTestLevel value can range from 1 to 4:
   1 - Most extensive testing, can be expensive.
   2 - Basic testing.
   3 - No testing.
   4 - Don't even allocate a guard page (default from SP3 onwards).

</PRE>After you enter the value, exit Registry Editor and reboot the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the extensible
Performance Monitor (Perfmon) counter, Siccntrs.dll, included with
Microsoft Commercial Internet System version 1.0. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
