The information in this article applies to:

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to replicate a file, the Content Replication System (CRS)
stops.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The CRS will stop a replication if:
<P>
<PRE>   - It does not have read access to the source file.
   - It does not have write access to the target file.
   - A file is deleted between the time the project starts and the
     file is sent.

</PRE>This behavior works in conjunction with transaction method to ensure the
data integrity of the entire project. However, this can cause problems when
replication is run in automatic mode with ACL replication.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
After you have identified the problem as being caused by one of the
suggested causes above, and you fix the problem, restart the replication
project. Or if the problem is serious, then apply the fix described below.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Commercial
Internet System, version 1.0 Service Pack 1 and Site Server version 2.0.
A supported fix is now available for the two cases that occur on the
Start-Point server. The case where the target file is locked will be
addressed in a future release.
<P>
This fix has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely
impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for
the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information.
