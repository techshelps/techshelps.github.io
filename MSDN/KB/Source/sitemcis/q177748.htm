The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Commercial Internet System version 1.0
<LI>Site Server version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot Content Replication System (CRS), you can generate and
analyze log files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT Logs</h3>
 
<P>
CRS always writes basic logging to the Windows NT Event Log. Below is an
example of the events written to the application log during a successful
replication. The timestamp and machine name have been omitted:
<P>
<PRE>   CRS  Information  None  15024  Summary information for replication of
   project test to server WILLBELL:
          Total Scanned          :   1733 Files 257684188 Bytes
          Actually Sent          :      8 Files   133877 Bytes
          Not Sent due to match  :   1599 Files 257550311 Bytes

   CRS  None  None    15018  Replication for project test completed
   sucessfully.
   CRS  Information  None  15017  Replicaton for project test started by
   user willbell with flags NONE.
   CRS  Information  None  15015  Content Replication Service started
   successfully.
   CRS  Information  None  15016  Content Replication Service shutdown
   successfully.

</PRE>To save event logs, click Save As on the Log menu. If the file is large,
select Event Log Files (*.EVT) as the Save As type. It is also useful to
clear the Application log before doing a replication. Always verify that
there are no hardware-related problems in the System log.
<P>
<P><h3>Generating Logs</h3>
 
<P>
If CRS generates an error, you will need to generate CRS log files. To do
this, add the global setting FullLogging. Three commands are needed to turn
on this setting:
<P>
<PRE>   crs stop
   crs setglobal fulllogging=YES
   crs start

</PRE>This will add the registry key FullLogging with a value of YES to the
Windows NT Registry. You can check this either with the command:
<P>
<PRE>   Crs queryglobal

</PRE>Or, you can add the registry value manually with Regedt32.exe. If you edit
the registry, be aware of the following:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help
topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before
you edit it.
<P>
To add the FullLogging value:

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Go to the following key in the registry:
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\CRS

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Add Value and use the following entry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: FullLogging
</PRE>
<P><LI>Exit Registry Editor.
<P>
</OL>If you open this key and find that the value has a type of REG_UNKOWN and a
hexadecimal value of 59 45 53, you mistyped the word FullLogging. Remember
is that there is no error checking. Any word that you type after setglobal
will be added to the registry. Obviously, if the value is not correct, no
log files will be generated.
<P>
<P><h3>Log Files</h3>
 
<P>
When replication is log files will be written to this location:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Site Server Root&gt;:\CRS\Logfiles

</PRE></OL>There are three different log files:
<P>
<PRE>   CRS.LOG
   CRSSRV.LOG
   WEBADMIN.LOG

</PRE>Crs.log is created if you use the CRS command line interface. This file
will be renamed Crs.old when CRS is stopped and restarted. Webadmin.log is
only generated if you open the CRS Web Administration page. This file is
kept locked by the World Wide Web Publishing Service even after CRS is
stopped. Thus the only way to delete or rename the Webadmin.log file is to
stop and restart the WWW service. Both of these files will give information
such as this the creation of a socket. Generally these files do not contain
useful information.
<P>
Crssrv.log contains the information you will need to understand any problem
that has happened in a replication. The Crssrv.log has a limit of 8 MB
(8,388,608 bytes). Once this limit is reached, the file will be copied to
Crssrv.old. Remember that only the next time the limit is reached the OLD
file will be overwritten. Thus by default you will get a maximum 16 MB of
log data.
<P>
If you cannot find the error in the log or the old file then you will need
to increase the amount of data being logged. To increase the limit:

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Go to the following key in the registry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\CRS
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Add Value and type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: LogLimit
      Data Type: REG_DWORD
      Radix: Dec
      Value: 25165824
</PRE>
<P><LI>Exit Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Stop and restart the CRS service by using Services in Control Panel or
</OL>by doing either of the following at the command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>      Net Stop CRS

   -OR-

      Net Start CRS

</PRE></OL>In this example, a LogLimit value of 25165824 will produce a Crssrv.log
file that will grow up to 24 MB. Then it will roll over to the Crssrv.old
file. Thus you will get a total of 48 MB (24 MB+24 MB) of data.
<P>
<P><h3>Reading Log Files</h3>
 
<P>
All three log files have the same format. The file is separated into six
columns: Date, Time, Type, Error Number, Thread Number, and Text Message.
<P>
The timestamp only is accurate to seconds, just like the Windows NT Event
Log. The number of actions that are handled in a second make this field not
useful for search purposes. It is always a good idea to synchronize the
clock on the starting-point and end-point servers. You can do this with the
following command:
<P>
<PRE>   Net time \\&lt;machine_name&gt; /Set

</PRE>There are six types of possible log entries:
<P>
<PRE>   DBG   = Debug
   INF   = Information
   WRN   = Warning
   ERR   = Error
   FTL   = Fatal
   UNK   = Unknown.

</PRE>Most of the events are marked DBG and the error number is zero. If the type
is not DBG or INF, you will also get an Error Number.
<P>
The next field is the Thread number. This is crucial to understanding where
CRS is sending the file. If multiple destinations are configured you can
find the destination by looking when a thread is created. This will tell
you what files are being sent.
<P>
The final field is the Text Message. This will tell you what action is
taking place. If an error occurs you can see what function was called and
what line of source code was executing. In some cases you can also find the
return code.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Log</h3>
 
<P>
This is an example of an error found in the CRSSRV.LOG file:
<P>
<PRE>   11/21/97 15:55:33 WRN 10053 183 recv
   @E:\77fre\server\crs\crsdll\cserve.cpp 1876

</PRE>First, you should notice that the type is not set to ERR. Most of the time
CRS will write a Windows NT Event as an error but in the log it has the WRN
type. This is what was written to the Application Log:
<P>
<PRE>   11/21/97 3:55:33 PM CRS Error  None 15162 Waiting to abort project
   CRSVIEW after losing connection with source machine.

</PRE>Second, the error code written to the event log (in this case 15162) is
different from the error number in the log (in this case 10053).
<P>
Third, you can see that thread 183 failed in the recv function, which is
located in the CSERVE.CPP source file. The failure happened on line 1876.
