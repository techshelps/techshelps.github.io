<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Remote OLE Automation involves cross-machine calls across a network, which
can really slow things down, so it is important to keep a few things in
mind while making such remote calls. This article lists the ways in which
you could optimize the performance of your remote calls.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
First, always use Early Binding. This reduces the number of calls between
objects by about 50%. This can make a big performance difference when
remoting objects (especially over RAS). The only time you should use late
binding is if you do not know ahead of time what the object is that you
will be connecting to.
<P>
Second, when calling methods on objects, create a method that accepts 'n'
number of parameters than exposing 'n' properties on the object, setting
each, and then calling the method. This is faster because the OLE call is
the more expensive part in terms of execution time. Passing relatively
large amounts of data within the call works well. The one limitation to
keep in mind while doing this is that if you are using a 16-bit object, you
can't pass more than 64k of data at one time.
