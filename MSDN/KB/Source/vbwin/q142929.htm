The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Enterprise Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic, version 4.0, for
   Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses differences in the DAO (Data Access Object) model
versus the RDO (Remote Data Object) model in Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0,
Enterprise Edition for Windows. Remote Data Objects only come with the
Enterprise Edition, so you will need this edition to take advantage of the
RDO model.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
According to the online help, the Data Access Object model is defined as
follows:
<P>
You can use Data Access Objects to manipulate databases in either the
native Jet database engine .MDB format or in other installable ISAM
database formats, including Fox, dBASE, Excel, Btrieve, Paradox, and
delimited Text.
<P>
In addition, you can use the Microsoft Jet database engine to access
Microsoft SQL Server and any other database that can be accessed with an
ODBC driver using the same DAO code.
<P>
According to the online help, the Remote Data Object model is defined as
follows:
<P>
With RDO and the RemoteData control, your applications can access ODBC data
sources without using a local query processor. This can mean significantly
higher performance and more flexibility when accessing remote database
engines. Although you can access any ODBC data source with RDO and the
RemoteData control, these features are designed to take advantage of
database servers, like Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle, that use
sophisticated query engines.
<P>
By using RDO, you can create simple cursor-less result sets, or more
complex cursors. You can also run queries that return any number of result
sets, or execute stored procedures that return result sets with or without
output parameters and return values. You can limit the number of rows
returned and monitor all of the messages and errors generated by the remote
data source without compromising the executing query. RDO also permits
either synchronous or asynchronous operation so your application doesn't
need to be blocked while lengthy queries are executed.
<P>
<P><h2>DIFFERENCES:</h2>
 
<P>
The following are differences between DAO and RDO:

<UL><LI>The DAO model is used for ISAM, Access and ODBC databases. The RDO model
   is designed for ODBC databases only, and it has been optimized for
   Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 and Oracle.

<LI>The RDO model can have better performance, with the processing being
   done by the server and not the local machine. Some processing is done
   locally with the DAO model, so performance may not be as good.

<LI>The DAO model uses the Jet Engine. The RDO model does not use Jet
   Engine, it uses the ODBC backend engine.

<LI>The RDO model has the capability to perform synchronous or asynchronous
   queries. The DAO model has limitations in performing these type of
   queries.

<LI>The RDO model can perform complex cursors, which are limited in the DAO
   model.
<P>
</UL><h3>Sample Program</h3>
 
<P>
The following sample program will perform identical ODBC database
operations in DAO, then RDO. Compare the DBEngine, Workspace, Database, and
Recordset objects in DAO to the rdoEngine, rdoEnvironment, rdoConnection,
and rdoResultset objects in RDO.

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add two command buttons to Form1.

<P><LI>Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of form1.
<P>
   Option Explicit
<PRE>   Private Sub Command1_Click()
     'The following code is used with DAO to open an ODBC database,
     'process a query, and return a set of records.
     'Notice that this code makes a "DSN-less" connection
     Dim ws As Workspace
     Dim db As Database
     Dim rs As Recordset
     Dim sql As String
     sql = "Select * From titles"
     Set ws = DBEngine.Workspaces(0)
     Dim cnStr As String
     cnStr = "driver={SQL Server};server=mysvr;" &amp; _
       "database=pubs;uid=myuid;pwd=mypwd"
     Set db = ws.OpenDatabase(Name:="PUBS", Exclusive:=False, _
       ReadOnly:=False, Connect:=cnStr)
     Set rs = db.OpenRecordset(sql, dbOpenDynaset)
     rs.MoveLast
     MsgBox "DAO: " &amp; Str(rs.RecordCount) &amp; " rows returned."
     rs.Close
     db.Close
     ws.Close
   End Sub

   Private Sub Command2_Click()
     'The following code is used with RDO to open an ODBC database,
     'process an asynchronous query, and return a set of records.
     'Notice that this code makes a "DSN-less" connection
     Dim en As rdoEnvironment
     Dim cn As rdoConnection
     Dim rs As rdoResultset
     Dim sql As String
     sql = "Select * From titles"
     Set en = rdoEngine.rdoEnvironments(0)
     With en
       .CursorDriver = rdUseOdbc
     End With
     Dim cnStr As String
     cnStr = "driver={SQL Server};server=mysvr;" &amp; _
       "database=pubs;uid=myuid;pwd=mypwd"
     Set cn = en.OpenConnection(DSName:="", Prompt:=rdDriverNoPrompt, _
       Connect:=cnStr)
     Set rs = cn.OpenResultset(Name:=sql, Type:=rdOpenKeyset, _
       Option:=rdAsyncEnable)
     While rs.StillExecuting
       DoEvents
     Wend
     rs.MoveLast
     MsgBox "RDO: " &amp; Str(rs.RowCount) &amp; " rows returned."
     rs.Close
     cn.Close
     en.Close
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Note that you will need to change your DRIVER, SERVER, DATABASE, UID,
   and PWD in the OpenConnection and OpenDatabase methods. You will also
   need to modify the SQL statement contained in the Command1_Click event
   to match your own SQL data source.

<P><LI>Start the program or press the F5 key.

<P><LI>You can then click on the Command1 button to execute the DAO model code
   or the Command2 button to execute the RDO model code. Notice that the
   RDO model performs the query asynchronously.
