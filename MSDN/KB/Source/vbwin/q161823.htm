The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Professional and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic,
   for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
NOTE: This article assumes that you are familiar with authoring Microsoft
Windows Help files and have created the source (.rtf) and project (.hpj)
files needed to create a Help file.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to exclude topics from a Help file, such as
topics that only apply to a specific product or a specific version of a
product that the user does not have. With the advent of Full Text Search,
it is difficult to hide these topics from the end user.
<P>
The Help Compiler Workshop's Help Compiler has a feature that allows Help
authors to exclude specified topics by tagging them in the source (.rtf)
file. Any of the topics in the source (.rtf) file that are used to create
the Help file can be tagged to indicate whether or not the topic should be
compiled.
<P>
If you want to place a build tag on a topic, you need to mark the topic in
the source file with the "*" footnote. The text associated with the "*"
footnote is called the tag. A tag can have up to 32 characters.
<P>
The project file (.hpj) that is used to generate the Microsoft Windows Help
file must be modified to let the Help Compiler know whether you want to
include or exclude the tagged topics in the finished Help file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>In the Source (.rtf) File</h3>
 
<P>
In the source .rtf file, use the "*" footnote to tag a topic. This footnote
must be the first footnote for the topic. For instance, if your footnotes
are in the order "*#KA$" with the "*" at the beginning of the list, then
the Help Compiler can properly tag the topic. If the "*" appears anywhere
else in the sequence, then the compiler displays a warning.
<P>
For example, if you want to exclude several topics from your compiled Help
file you must have a "*" footnote in each one of the topics that you want
to exclude. Associate text to the footnote of these tagged topics to
indicate that you do not want them compiled. This can be done by
associating text such as "NoCompile" on the "*" footnotes. "NoCompile"
becomes the tag for these topics.
<P>
If you do not have any "*" footnotes on a topic, then, by default, the
topic is compiled and becomes a topic in the finished Help file.
<P>
You may also find it necessary to tag a topic to be included in the
compile. The procedure for tagging the text is the same. You need to place
a "*" footnote on the topic and associate a tag name with that topic. As
far as the .rtf file is concerned, it doesn't matter whether you intend to
include or exclude the tagged topic from the finished Help file. The .rtf
file is used only to tag the topic. Whether the tagged topic is included in
the compiled Help file or not is determined in the .hpj (project) file.
There are several ways to do this. Please note that build tags are not case
sensitive.
<P>
<P><h3>In the Project (.hpj) File</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Explicitly indicate whether to include or exclude the tagged topic with
Help Workshop.

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Open to open the .hpj file.

<P><LI>Click Options.

<P><LI>In the Options dialog box, click the Build Tags tab.

<P><LI>In the upper ListBox, add the tags that you want to include. In the
   lower ListBox, add the tags that you want to exclude. In the preceding
   example, you would place "NoCompile" in the lower ListBox. Again, please
   note that the topic is compiled by default if it is not tagged.

<P><LI>Click OK after you finish adding the tags to the appropriate ListBoxes.
   Now all of the tags that you added to the upper ListBox appear in the
   [INCLUDE] section of the .hpj and all of the tags that you added to the
   lower ListBox appear in the [EXCLUDE] section of the .hpj.

<P><LI>Click "Save and Compile" to compile the Help file.
<P>
</OL>The finished Help file contains all of the topics that were not marked with
"*" footnote. It also contains any topics that were marked with the "*"
footnote in the source (.rtf) file and whose tags were placed in the
[INCLUDE] section of the project (.hpj) file.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Indicate which tags to include or exclude by using a text editor and the
BUILD command.

<OL><P><LI>Use a text editor such as Notepad to display your .hpj file.

<P><LI>Add a [BUILDTAGS] section to the .hpj file. In this section, you need to
   list all of the tags used in your .rtf. If you use "NoCompile" as a tag
   on a topic with a "*" footnote, then you need to list "NoCompile" in the
   [BUILDTAGS] section of the .hpj. If you use "Compile" as a tag to
   indicate that you want to include a topic in the finished Help file then
   you also need to list "Compile" in the [BUILDTAGS] section. For the
   preceding example, the .hpj would look like the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [BUILDTAGS]
      NoCompile
      Compile
</PRE>
<P><LI>After listing the build tags, you need to let the compiler know which
   tags indicate topics to compile and which tags indicate topics to
   exclude. This is done using the BUILD command in the [OPTIONS] section
   of the .hpj file. A typical BUILD command might look like this:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [OPTIONS]
      .
      .
      BUILD = (Compile | Other) &amp; (~NoCompile)
      .
      .
</PRE><P>
   The tilda "~" tells the compiler not to include the topic.
<P>
   The ampersand "&amp;" is equivalent to a logical "and."
<P>
   The vertical line "|" is equivalent to a logical  "or."
<P>
   The above BUILD command compiles all of the topics that have either the
   "Compile" or Other tags and do not have the "NoCompile" tag. All topics
   that are not marked with the "*" footnote are compiled by default. Only
   one BUILD option can be specified per project (.hpj) file.

<P><LI>After modifying the .hpj file, save the text file and make sure that the
   file has the .hpj extension.

<P><LI>Open the .hpj file in Help Workshop, and then compile.
<P>
</OL>If there is an [INCLUDE] or [EXCLUDE] section in your project file when you
compile a file, Help Workshop ignores any BUILD command you may have
specified in the [OPTIONS] section of the .hpj file. If you use Method 1,
you do not need to have a [BUILDTAGS] section.
