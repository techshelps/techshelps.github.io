The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft
   Visual Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup Wizard for Visual Basic 4.0 allows commas within filenames that
are distributed with Visual Basic program files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With the release of Windows NT 3.1, special characters in filenames, as
well as long filenames, were allowed. This broke the restrictive 8.3
character file name rule that limited MS-DOS filenames, and allowed for
more descriptive and useful filenames. In particular, the comma could now
be used in a filename such as an alphanumeric character.
<P>
Realizing this, the Setup Wizard for Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 now allows
the use of commas within filenames. If you add a file manually whose
filename contains a comma to the list of targeted distribution files, the
Setup Wizard will put quotes around the added file in order to signify that
a comma was used within the filename. You should be aware of this if you
intend to edit the SETUP.LST file manually after the Setup Wizard initially
generates it.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
In the following sample Files section of SETUP.LST, File1 is an example of
a normal filename, while File2 is an example of a filename with a comma
used. Note that the comma is used as the delimiter for each entry. To solve
this potential conflict, the Setup Wizard placed double-quotes (" ") around
the filenames in question:
<P>
<PRE>   &gt;&gt; [Files]
   &gt;&gt;

   File1=1,,Calc.EX_,Calc.EXE,$(AppPath),$(EXESelfRegister),,6/5/1995,14336
   ,1.0.0.0

   &gt;&gt; File2=1,,"my,test.tx_","my,test.txt",$(AppPath),,,6/5/1995,20

</PRE>NOTE:  This functionality is only available with the [Files] Section of
SETUP.LST. Files that make use of commas in their filenames cannot be
placed within the [BootStrap] Section of SETUP.LST. The [BootStrap] Section
should only contain Visual Basic 4.0 runtime-required files and none of
these files have commas in their filenames. The only way this situation can
occur is if SETUP.LST is edited manually after its initial creation. This
should be a rare occurrence and it is not suggested.
<P>
