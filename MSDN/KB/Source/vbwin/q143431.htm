<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT Resource Kit provides two utilities that allow you to create
a Windows NT user-defined service for an application (executable) or batch
file. This article describes how to use these two utilities, SRVANY.EXE and
INSTSRV.EXE, to set up the Automation Manager as a Windows NT service. In
this article you will be instructed to use the Registry Editor,
REGEDT32.EXE. Before doing so, please read the following:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When using the Registry Editor, you will be instructed to add a key or add
a value to the Registry. To add a key, select Edit from the Registry Editor
menu and choose Add Key. Similarly, to add a value, select Edit and then
choose Add Value. Making any of the above selections will result in a
prompt for further data. Please follow the steps below for the correct
setting.
<P>
To set Automation Manager as a Windows NT service, do the following
step-by-step instructions:

<OL><P><LI>Copy SRVANY.EXE and INSTSRV.EXE to your system32 directory.

<P><LI>Select a name for your service, AutoMan for instance, and install it as
   a new service by typing the following at the command line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      INSTSRV AutoMan C:\windows\system32\SRVANY.EXE
</PRE>
<P><LI>If new service is created successfully, you should get the following:
<P>
   CreateService SUCCESS
   Don't forget!!! You must now go to the Control Panel and use the
   Services utility to change the account name and password that this
   newly installed service will use when it attempts to logon as a service
   when it starts. Also, use the Services utility to ensure this newly
   installed service starts automatically, since the point of this service
   is to start automatically and apply the DACLs to the floppy drives
   prior to a user logging on at the keyboard

<P><LI>Now go to the Control Panel and open the Services utility.

<P><LI>Select your new service, in this case AutoMan, and click the Startup
   button.

<P><LI>If you want your service to start every time you boot your machine,
   select Automatic for Startup Type in the Service dialog box. Otherwise
   select Manual or Disabled. If you select Manual, you will need to go
   into the Services utility, select the service, and click the Start or
   Stop button every time you want to start or stop the service.

<P><LI>Select System Account for Log On As, and make sure to check the Allow
   Service to Interact with Desktop option.

<P><LI>Click OK and Close the Services utility.

<P><LI>Run REGEDT32.

<P><LI>Under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AutoMan, add
   a new key and set its name to "Parameters" (without quotes). Notice
   that AutoMan is only the service name in this case. You may have chosen
   a different name.

<P><LI>Under Parameters, add a new value. Set Value Name to "Application" and
   leave the default REG_SZ for Data Type. When prompted for the value's
   string, set it to reflect the path and filename of the Automation
   Manager, for example C:\windows\system32\AUTMGR32.EXE.

<P><LI>If you intend to run the Automation Manager invisible, add another
   value under the Parameters key and set its name to "AppParameters".
   Leave the default REG_SZ for Data Type, and set the String to
   "/hidden".

<P><LI>Now Exit RegEdt32 and restart your machine. If you selected Automatic
   for Startup Type in step 6, the Automation Manager should start
   automatically. Otherwise, open the Services utility from the Control
   Panel and start the service manually. If you chose to run Automation
   Manager hidden, you can verify that it is running by using PView.
