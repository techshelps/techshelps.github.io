The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation, Learning, Professional, and
   Enterprise Editions for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using the Printer object, you cannot change any page settings after
using the NewPage method. This includes Orientation, Height, Width,
PaperSize, PrintQuality, and PaperBin.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, either replace NewPage with EndDoc or print
with API functions exclusively without using the Printer object.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
bug and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When printing via the Visual Basic Printer object, replacing NewPage with
EndDoc is the only workaround to this problem. While this works as expected
in many circumstances, this is not always an acceptable solution in multi-
user environments. This article provides an API solution to this problem.
Because this code creates a Device Context (DC) for your printer and you
can only print to one DC at a time, it has the limitation that you cannot
use the Printer object at the same time. So, you must end this document
before returning to using the Printer object.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a Standard EXE Project. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Form_Load event:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Printer.PaperBin = vbPRBNLower ' 2
      Printer.Print "Testing Lower Bin"
      Printer.NewPage
      Printer.PaperBin = vbPRBNUpper ' 1
      Printer.Print "Testing Upper Bin"
      Printer.EndDoc
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run the project. This produces the message "Run-time error '396':
<PRE>   'Paperbin' property cannot be set within a page". Clicking on "Debug"
   will highlight the line following the NewPage.

</PRE><P><LI>Make sure that the printer orientation is set to Portrait and the paper
   source is set to Upper Tray or AutoSelect. Then Run the Project and
   click on Command1.
<P>
</OL>If your printer has both an upper and a lower paper tray and supports both
orientations, this will print the first page to the upper tray in Portrait
and then a second page from the lower tray in Landscape.
