The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft
   Visual Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you have long declare statements in conditional code, if you copy the
declare from one condition to the other, then modify the identifier in the
Alias clause, additional changes occur in your declaration which you did
not specify.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. The Alias clause disappears and the type
elements wrap differently; however, the code runs as desired.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce the Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Place the following code in the declaration section of Form1.
<P>
<P><PRE>    #If Win32 Then
       Private Declare Function ShellExecute Lib _
<PRE></PRE>          "shell32.dll" Alias "ShellExecuteA" _
            (ByVal hwnd As Long, _
             ByVal lpOperation As String, _
             ByVal lpFile As String, _
             ByVal lpParameters As String, _
             ByVal lpDirectory As String, _
             ByVal nShowCmd As Long) As Long
    #Else
    #End If

</PRE><P><LI>Copy the Declare statement in the "If Win32" clause and paste it in the
   #Else clause.

<P><LI>Insert the cursor following the "A" in "ShellExecuteA" and backspace
   over the "A".

<P><LI>Commit the line by stepping off the declare statement.

<P><LI>The line continuation for the #ELSE clause gets scrambled as is shown
   below. The Alias clause is gone and the type elements are not wrapped as
   you would expect; however, the code runs as desired.
<P>
<P><PRE>    #If Win32 Then
      Private Declare Function ShellExecute Lib _
<PRE></PRE>          "shell32.dll" Alias "ShellExecuteA" _
            (ByVal hwnd As Long, _
             ByVal lpOperation As String, _
             ByVal lpFile As String, _
             ByVal lpParameters As String, _
             ByVal lpDirectory As String, _
             ByVal nShowCmd As Long) As Long
    #Else
      Private Declare Function ShellExecute Lib _
          "shell32.dll" (ByVal _
            hwnd As Long, ByVal lpOperation _
             As String, ByVal lpFile _
             As String, ByVal lpParameters _
             As String, ByVal lpDirectory _
             As String, ByVal nShowCmd _
             As Long) As Long
    #End If

</PRE></OL>If you press CTRL+Z to undo the erasing of the "A", the following will
appear. The actual edit is undone, but your incorrect line continuations
are still there. This code will not run because part of the declaration is
missing.
<P>
<PRE>      Private Declare Function ShellExecute Lib _
          "shell32.dll" Alias "ShellExecuteA" _
            hwnd As Long, ByVal lpOperation _
             As String, ByVal lpFile _
             As String, ByVal lpParameters _
             As String, ByVal lpDirectory _
             As String, ByVal nShowCmd _
             As Long) As Long
