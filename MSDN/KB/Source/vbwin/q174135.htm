The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Professional and Enterprise Editions for
   Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Executing a Setup.exe program created by the Visual Basic 5.0
Application
Setup Wizard on a client machine may cause the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   "Setup cannot continue because some system files are out of
</PRE>date on your
<PRE>   system. Click OK if you would like setup to update these files
</PRE>now. You
<PRE>   will need to restart Windows before you can run setup again.
</PRE>Click
<PRE>   Cancel to exit setup without updating system files".

</PRE>Choosing Ok causes the application to install the correct file;
selecting
Cancel stops the operation. The setup process will not complete
successfully until the correct file has been installed on the
system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The above message occurs when the version of Oleaut32.dll on the
client
machine is older than version 2.20.0000. Certain files critical to
the
installation process of Visual Basic 5.0 applications require
Oleaut32.dll
version 2.20.0000 or later.
<P>
By selecting OK to the above message, Setup.exe will install a
newer
version of Oleaut32.dll that is compatible with the installation
program.
In order for this file to be updated to the correct version, the
operating
system must be restarted. Therefore, after the correct file is
installed,
the user will be prompted to restart the computer. The application
setup
process cannot continue until the machine is restarted. After the
machine
is rebooted, re-run the application Setup.exe program.
<P>
If you choose Cancel, the Setup.exe program will terminate. The
application
setup will not complete until version 2.20.0000 or later of
Oleaut32.dll is
installed on the system.
<P>

following
