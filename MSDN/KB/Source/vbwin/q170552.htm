<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Often it is desirable to have a DBCombo pick-list to allow users to choose
a single data item and have a set of records from a different but related
table display. Most often this scenario is based on two tables with a one-
to-many relationship. The DBCombo box lists records from the table on the
"one" side of the relationship and other controls show the records from the
table on the "many" side of the relationship.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A one-to-many relationship is based on a field that exists in both tables
in the relationship. The field in the one side of the relationship is a
unique field. The same field in the many side of the relationship can
contain duplicate values. Two Data controls should be used to coordinate
the two tables.
<P>
The DBCombo box must present records from the one side table using a field
that is easily interpreted by the user. Usually, the field presented to the
user is different than the field used in the relationship. That being the
case, after a selection is made in the DBCombo box the corresponding
relationship field or join field must be retrieved. The relationship field
from the current record selected in the DBCombo box can then be used to
filter the data from the many side table in the second data control using
an SQL "WHERE" clause in the RecordSource property of the data control.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Program</h3>
 
<P>
This program uses the Biblio database's Titles and Publishers table to
illustrate creating a one-to-many relation with a DBCombo box. There is a
one-to-many relation between the Publishers and Titles tables in the Biblio
database joined on the PubID field. The DBCombo box shows a list of
possible Publishers' names and the DBGrid control displays the related
records on the many side of the relationship, namely the Titles table:
