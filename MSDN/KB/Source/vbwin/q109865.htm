The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic
<PRE>  programming system for Windows, versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Usually when you issue two consecutive mouse clicks on a form or object,
you will receive a click event for the first mouse click and another click
event or a double-click event for the second mouse click -- depending on
the period of time between the mouse clicks.
<P>
At times, you may want to receive only the double-click event without the
preceding click event. This article describes how to write code to
accomplish this.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following example demonstrates how to receive only a DblClick
event on a form rather than a Click and then a DblClick event.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a Timer control (Timer1) to Form1.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the (general) (declarations) section of
   Form1:
<P>
<PRE>   ' The following Function gets the DoubleClickSpeed from the WIN.INI
   ' file. Windows uses this setting to determine how close together two
   ' consecutive mouse clicks must occur for it to be interpreted as
   ' a double-click.
   ' Enter the following Declare statement on one, single line:
   Declare Function GetProfileInt% Lib "Kernel" (ByVal lpAppName$,
      ByVal lpKeyName$, ByVal nDefault%)

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the specified event procedures:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Form_Load ()
      clickSpeed% = GetProfileInt("Windows", "DoubleClickSpeed", 0)
      Timer1.Enabled = False         ' Timer should be off to begin with.
      Timer1.Interval = clickSpeed%  ' After the timer is turned on
                                     ' it will trigger the Timer Event
                                     ' after a specific amount of time
                                     ' equal to that of DoubleClickSpeed.
   End Sub

   Sub Form_Click ()
      Timer1.Enabled = True          ' Turn the timer on. If another mouse
                                     ' click does not occur within the
                                     ' DoubleClickSpeed interval, the
                                     ' Timer1_Timer Event will fire.
   End Sub

   Sub Form_DblClick ()
      Timer1.Enabled = False         ' Turn off the timer. This
                                     ' prevents the Timer1_Timer event
                                     ' from firing and thus the code
                                     ' for a single click will not be
                                     ' processed.
      Print "This is a double-click" ' Code for double-click goes here.
   End Sub

   Sub Timer1_Timer ()
      ' If this event occurs then there has not been another mouse
      ' click since the previous one within the DoubleClickSpeed
      ' time interval. Thus there will be two Click events rather
      ' than a DblClick Event.
      Timer1.Enabled = False         ' Turn off the timer so the
                                     ' Timer1_Timer Event does not
                                     ' continue to fire.
      Print "This is a Single Click" ' Code for single click goes here.
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run the program.

<P><LI>Click once, wait a while, click again to receive two single clicks.

<P><LI>Click twice quickly to receive a double-click with no preceding single
   click.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The single click code will not occur until the DoubleClickSpeed
interval passes and the Timer1_Timer event is fired.
