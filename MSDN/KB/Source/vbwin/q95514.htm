<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, version 2.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a grid control loses focus, the focus rectangle surrounding the
active cell incorrectly remains on the cell.
<P>
This behavior differs from that of the grid control that shipped with
the Professional Toolkit for Visual Basic version 1.0. The active cell,
with the focus rectangle, can be differentiated from other cells in the
grid by its wider border when GridLines is set to True or by the fact
that it is the only cell with a border when GridLines is set to False.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem, change the active cell to one in a fixed row
or column so that no cell has a focus rectangle. Selected cells are
unaffected by changing the active cell. For example, add the following
code to the LostFocus event of a grid control named grid1:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Grid1_LostFocus ()
      Grid1.Row = 0
      Grid1.Col = 0
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in both the Standard and
Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic version 2.0 for Windows.
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0 for
Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Run Visual Basic, or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT, F, N)
   if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Add File. In the Files box, select the
   GRID.VBX custom control file. The grid tool appears in the Toolbox.
   In Visual Basic version 3.0, GRID.VBX is automatically installed.

<P><LI>Add a grid control (Grid1) to Form1 with the following properties:
<P>
   Rows: 5
   Cols: 5

<P><LI>Add a text box (Text1) to Form1.

<P><LI>From the Run menu, choose Start (ALT, R, S) to run the program. Grid1
   gets the focus on startup and the focus rectangle is around R1C1.

<P><LI>Tab to the text box. Focus changes from Grid1 to Text1. Even though
   focus changed to Text1, the focus rectangle on R1C1 on the Grid1
   incorrectly remains.
