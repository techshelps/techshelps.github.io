The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation, Learning, Professional, and
   Enterprise Editions for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions,
   32-bit only, for Windows, version 4.0 on the following platforms:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows API provides the ability to perform a copy, move, rename, or
delete operations on a file system object using the SHFileOperation
function that is exported by Shell32.DLL. The example below shows how to
copy a list of files into a named folder and then move them to the Recycle
Bin. The SHFileOperation provides the ability to move, rename, or delete
based on the flags passed to it. For more information on what options are
available, see the REFERENCES section at the end of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following example creates a single form Visual Basic project using the
SHFileOperation API function.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new “Standard EXE” project. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Place two CommandButtons on Form1 (Command1 and Command2).

<P><LI>From the Project menu, select Add Module to add a module to the project.

<P><LI>Add the following code, consisting of function, type, and constant
   declarations, to Module1:

   Note: This sample makes use of VB.HLP and VB.CNT that are installed with
   a complete installation of Microsoft Visual Basic. If you do not have
   these files, this sample can be altered to copy other existing files.
