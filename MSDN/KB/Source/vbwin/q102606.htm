The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic
<PRE>  programming system for Windows, version 2.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Visual Basic version 2.0 if you add one of the graphical controls
(label, image, or line control) as a child to the graph control, the
graph image within the graph control is repainted incorrectly and the
graphical control moved behind the graph image. The problem does not
occur when non-graphical controls are used.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is caused by a bug in the graph control where the repainting of the
graph image cannot handle the graphical controls as child controls.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this problem, place a picture box as a child on the graph. Then
place the graphical control in the picture box. This works well when using
the label control but is not very useful when using the other graphical
controls.
<P>
The only other way to work around this problem in Visual Basic version 2.0
is to not add a graphical control as a child of the Graph control; that is,
use only non-graphical controls.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Visual Basic version 2.0 for
Windows. This problem was corrected in Visual Basic version 3.0 for Windows
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem was fixed in Visual Basic version 3.0 with the new version of
the graph control (GRAPH.VBX version 2.0). The solution was to remove the
ability of the graph control to support child controls. Therefore, in
Visual Basic version 3.0, you cannot add any control as a child to the
graph control.
