The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 5.0, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Closing a form with the control box "X" only hides the form. When showing
the form a second time, values that that may have been changed on the form
are not reset as you would expect. Properties that may have changed
(including the form caption, text in textboxes, window position, and the
hwnd of the form) remain the same.
<P>
Although it can seem to be a related issue, it is important to note that in
Visual Basic, it is expected behavior for form level variables to remain in
memory when a form is closed using the control box "X."
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The workaround is to include code to re-initialize the form in the form
load event, which does fire when the form is re-shown after being closed
via the control box "X."
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
bug and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open a new Windows CE project in Visual Basic 5.0. Form1 is created by
   default.

<P><LI>Add another form (Form2) to the project.

<P><LI>Add a CommandButton (Command1) to Form1.

<P><LI>Add a CommandButton (Commend1) and a Textbox (Text1) to Form2.

<P><LI>Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of Form1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Command1_Click()
<PRE></PRE>         Form2.Show
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of Form2:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Command1_Click()
<PRE></PRE>         Form2.Caption = "changed"
         Text1.Text = "changed"
         Command1.Caption = "changed"
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Press the F5 key to run the project. Click the CommandButton on Form1
   and note that Form2 appears. Click the CommandButton on Form2 and note
   that various values change.

<P><LI>Move Form2 to another position. Click the Control box "X" on Form2 and
   note that Form2 disappears.

<P><LI>Click the "Show2" button on Form1 and note that the form reappears in
   the position where it last was, with the form caption, command button
   caption, and text box text values it had before being closed.
