The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows,
<PRE>  versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE>- Microsoft Professional Toolkit for Microsoft Visual Basic programming
<PRE>  system for Windows, version 1.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Unpredictable results occur if a 3-D Panel custom control's AutoSize
property is set to 3 (AutoSize Child To Panel) and you place a Key
Status control with its AutoResize set to True on the 3-D Panel as a
child control. For example, the Key Status control keep may keep its
default size and move to the upper left corner of the panel, and the
Key Status control's top and left sizing handles may flash.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If a single control is placed on a 3-D Panel custom control with
AutoSize = 3 (AutoSize Child To Panel), the child control resizes to
exactly fit within the panel's inner bevel. This setting for the
AutoSize property has no effect if there are no child controls, more
than one control, or if the panel has no bevels. If the child control
has a fixed dimension (for example, the height of a combo box or a
drive box), then that dimension of the panel will be adjusted to fit
the child control instead while the other dimensions are resized to
fit the panel.
<P>
The Key Status custom control has its AutoSize property default set to
True, so its dimensions cannot be changed. However, 3-D Panel does not
resize to the size of the Key Status control. Instead, when you draw a
Key Status control onto a 3-D Panel with AutoSize = 3 and release the
mouse button, the Key Status control keeps its default size and moves
to the upper left corner of the panel, and the Key Status control's
top and left sizing handles will flash. Also, the sizing handles of
the Key Status control that you initially draw remain on the panel.
Notice that the size of the control in the right box on the Properties
bar will alternate between the size of the 3-D Panel and the size of
the Key Status control.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT, F, N)
   if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Add File. In the Files box, select the
   THREED.VBX custom control file. The 3-D Panel tool will appear in
   the toolbox.

<P><LI>Place a 3-D Panel control (Panel3D1) on Form1.

<P><LI>Set its AutoSize property to 3 (AutoSize Child To Panel).

<P><LI>Draw a Key Status control on the panel.
