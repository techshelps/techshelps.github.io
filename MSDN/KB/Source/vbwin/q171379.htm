<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Internet Transfer control will allow you to go through a Proxy server
to access information on an external FTP server. You can do this by
specifying the AccessType and the name of the proxy server in the Internet
Transfer Control.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Set the AccessType property to icNamedProxy.

<P><LI>An application can specify more than one proxy, including different
   proxies for the different protocols. For example, if you specify
   "ftp=ftp://ftp-gw gopher=<B>http://jericho:99</B> proxy," FTP requests are made
   through the FTP proxy "ftp-gw" that listens at port 21 (default for
   FTP), and Gopher requests are made through a proxy called "jericho" that
   listens at port 99. All other requests (for example, HTTP requests) are
   made through the proxy called "proxy" that listens at port 80.
<P>

<PRE>      
   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       Inet1.AccessType = icNamedProxy
      ' Using an CERN proxy server won't work here, you need to
      ' use a FTP proxy server when making FTP requests
      ' because CERN proxy servers don't except FTP requests.
      ' Inet1.Proxy = "<B>http://itgproxy:80</B>"
   
       Inet1.Proxy = "ftp=<B>ftp://ftp-gw</B>"
      'FTP proxy server works here because it expects FTP requests
       Inet1.URL = "<B><A HREF="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com</A></B>"

     ' making an HTTP request to a FTP proxy server.

     ' and the FTP proxy server and the Internet Transfer
     ' Control will route it to the correct one
     Inet3.Proxy = "ftp=ftp://ftp-gw http=<B>http://itgproxy:80</B>"
     MsgBox Inet2.OpenURL("<B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</A></B>")

           ' array (icByteArray) to retrieve a binary file.

<P>
The CERN-proxy protocol is widely recognized throughout the World Wide Web
(WWW) community as the standard for implementing proxy services in TCP/IP-
based networks. It has its origins within the standards for Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as a UNIX-based service first developed by members
of Switzerland’s Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleair (European
Laboratory for Particle Physics, or CERN) in the early 1990s.
<P>
As the CERN staff added application-aware proxy support for Hypertext
Transfer Protocol daemon (HTTPd) servers (commonly known as Web servers) to
their libraries, the WWW community built on these additions. In the time
since it was first introduced, the CERN-proxy protocol has become an
accepted industry standard for implementing HTTP proxy service. The
Microsoft Proxy Server Web Proxy service is fully compatible with the CERN-
proxy standard.
<P>
To better understand how CERN-proxy works, it is important to understand
the differences between how most Internet applications work (such as File
Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Gopher) and how HTTP applications work.
<P>
Standard TCP/IP applications such as FTP use TCP (or in some cases, User
Datagram Protocol, or UDP) as the transport-level protocol for supporting
client/server communications. For HTTP-based applications, a set of
commands (called methods) are defined that are used in Web-based
client/server communications. While CERN-compatible proxy services support
WWW (HTTP), FTP, and Gopher requests, it is important to keep in mind that
a CERN-based Web proxy server uses HTTP for all communications with its Web
Proxy clients.
<P>
Important: If your proxy server is a CERN proxy server, you cannot make
direct FTP connections by using the Execute method. In this case, to get a
file, use the OpenURL method with the Open, Put, and Close statements. You
can also use the OpenURL method to get a directory listing by invoking the
method and specifying the target directory as the URL.
