The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
During Visual Basic setup, you may encounter this error:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup could not be completed due to system errors

</PRE>Then setup terminates. This error usually occurs while setup is calculating
the amount of free disk space.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs because Visual Basic setup is attempting to use an older
version of LZEXPAND.DLL that it found on your computer. In all reported
cases of this problem, the LZEXPAND.DLL file is dated 7-Aug-91 and is
usually located in the WINDOWS directory.
<P>
One product that may install a copy of LZEXPAND.DLL dated 7-Aug-91 is
MicroHelp Muscle version 1.0. However, it is possible that other products
not sold by Microsoft may also install this file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To overcome this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Exit from Windows to MS-DOS.

<P><LI>Find the LZEXPAND.DLL file that's dated 7-Aug-91. It may be located in
   the WINDOWS or WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory, but it is usually in the
   WINDOWS directory.

<P><LI>Delete or rename the LZEXPAND.DLL dated 7-Aug-91 to a new name.

<P><LI>Locate a copy of LZEXPAND.DLL on your computer that has a date later
   than 7-Aug-91, and put it in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

<P><LI>If you don't find a later version of LZEXPAND.DLL, run the Windows Setup
   program from the Windows distribution disks. This will install a later
   version of LZEXPAND.DLL in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

<P><LI>Start Windows.

<P><LI>Run the Visual Basic setup program again.
<P>
</OL>The error should no longer occur.
