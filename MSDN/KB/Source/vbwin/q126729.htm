This article covers some of the most Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
about technical issues for Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows. You can
find this and other FAQ articles by querying on the keyword "FAQ." You can
find additional general references in the Microsoft Knowledge Base by
searching on "article list."

<PRE>1. Q. How do I create my own custom controls?

   A. Visual Basic 3.0 Professional Edition ships with the Control
      Development Kit (CDK), which allows you to create a custom control,
      that is, a VBX. However, to use the CDK you also need a C compiler
      that can create Windows DLLs. Visual C++ comes with a project option
      for building a VBX. You might find the following references useful
      when creating a Custom Control (VBX):

      Programming Windows 3.1
      by Charles Petzold
      ISBN 1-55615-395-3

      Windows Programming Power with Custom Controls
      by Paul Cilwa &amp; Jeff Duntemann
      ISBN:  1-088357-00-4

2. Q. How do I create an OLE control?

   A. Visual C++ 2.0 comes with the OLE CDK, which will allow you to create
      an OLE control. It also comes with the Control Migration Pack, which
      will help in transforming a VBX control written in C into an OLE
      control.

      For additional information, please see the following article(s) in
      the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../VBWIN/Q113895.htm">Q113895</A></B>
      TITLE     : Intro to Microsoft OLE Custom Control Architecture &amp;
                  Tools

      This article discusses OLE controls and their future within Visual
      Basic and Windows.

3. Q. How do I create a 32-bit VBX?

   A. You can't. Ever. You can, however, create both 16-bit and 32-bit
      versions of OLE controls (OCXs). Visual C++ 2.0 supports this with
      the OLE Control Development Kit.

4. Q. How do I create a 16 bit OCX? VC++ 2.0 is 32-bit only, right?

   A. Yes, Visual C++ 2.0 is 32-bit only. But it also ships with Visual C++
      1.51, which includes some bug fixes to 1.5 (our 16-bit compiler), and
      support for the OLE Control Development Kit. It also has a mechanism
      (the Control Migration Pack) for migrating the source code to a VBX
      you've created into an OCX via the AppWizard with relatively little
      effort.
