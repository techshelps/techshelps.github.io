<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Introduction to WHAT6</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows Help Authoring Toolkit for Microsoft Word version 6.0 for
Windows (WHAT6) consists of a Microsoft Word version 6.0 template file
(WHAT6.DOT), Help files to assist you in using WHAT6.DOT, and Windows
programs for creating bitmap hotspots and managing your Help project.
<P>
WHAT6 helps you create and edit Help topics. WHAT6 makes creating Help
files easier by providing dialog boxes to add Help features that would
otherwise need to be created using specialized Help coding and word-
processing functions. For example, instead of entering footnotes for a
topic's context string and title, you can type the information into a
dialog box.
<P>
The Help Authoring Template (WHAT6.DOT) makes it easier for you to:

<UL><LI>Create and edit topic files.
<LI>Insert and edit topics, graphics, and hot spots.
<LI>Format topic text and graphics.
<LI>Save topic files in RTF format.
<LI>View partial or complete builds of the topic file in Windows Help.
<LI>Insert bitmaps into your help file.
<LI>Apply help styles.
<LI>Format Lists.
<P>
</UL><h3>How the WHAT6.DOT Template Works</h3>
 
<P>
The Help Authoring Template is similar to other Word for Windows templates.
It contains a set of specialized macros and styles that become available
when you open a document based on the template. The template modifies
existing commands and adds new commands to the Word for Windows menus. The
result is a version of Word for Windows that has all the word-processing
functionality and yet is optimized for creating Help files.
<P>
<P><h3>Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
The WHAT6.DOT template requires Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows and
Windows Help version 3.10.505, which is fully compatible with Word for
Windows 6.0 Rich Text Format (RTF).
<P>
<P><h3>WHAT6 Includes 32 Files and Uses 2.72 Megabytes of Space</h3>
 
<P>
The following lists give the files names and directory locations for all
files that are a part of the WHAT6 utility. There is no SETUP utility for
this tool, so you will need to copy the files to the indicated directory.
<P>
The directory choices are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>\WINDOWS          The Windows directory (for example, C:\WINDOWS)
\WINDOWS\SYSTEM   The System directory (for example, C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM)
\WINWORD          Where WINWORD.EXE is located (for example, C:\WINWORD)
</PRE>\WINWORD\TEMPLATE Where you have your Word for Windows templates (.DOT
<PRE>                  files) are located (for example, C:\WINWORD\TEMPLATE)
\HELP             The Help file working directory. You can place
                  this directory anywhere you want and name it anything
                  you want (for example, C:\WINWORD\HELP). You will need
                  to create this directory.
\HELP\SAMPLE      Where the Help file samples will be placed. It is
                  usually set up as a directory off of your Help working
                  directory (for example, C:\WINWORD\HELP\SAMPLE). You
                  will need to create this directory.

<OL><P><LI>From within Word version 6.0, choose New... from the File Menu.

<P><LI>From the New dialog, select the Document radio button in the lower
   left and then select WHAT6 from the Template Combo Box.

<P><LI>Choose Macro from the Tools menu.

<P><LI>Select HelpOnWhat from the Macro Name Combo Box, and choose Edit.

<P><LI>Find the line of code that reads:
<P>
   t = WinHelp(hwnd,"\\merlin\winhelp\what\help\what6.hlp", hlpINDEX, 0)

<P><LI>Edit the command line so that it matches the location of the help
   file (for example, replace "\\merlin\winhelp\what\help\what6.hlp" with
   "C:\WINWORD\TEMPLATE\WHAT6.HLP").

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Close, and save the macro.

<P><LI>Close your document. When you're asked if you want to save changes to
   the .DOT template, choose Yes.
<P>
</OL><h3>Setting up Icons in Program Manager</h3>
 
<P>
When you finish copying all the files to their correct locations, you may
want to set up icons for some of the files and place them in a group in
Program Manager. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select an existing group or create a new group in Program Manager. To
   create a new group, choose New form the File menu in Program Manager.
   Select Program Group, and choose OK. Then type in a description for the
   new group and choose OK.

<P><LI>Once you have a program group selected, choose New form the File
   menu in Program Manager. Select Program Item, and choose OK. Then
   type in a description, command line, and working directory, and choose
   OK. Repeat this process for each of these items:
<P>
<PRE>   Description:         Help Project Editor
   Command Line:        C:\WINWORD\HELP\WHPE.EXE
   Working Directory:   C:\WINWORD\HELP

   Description:         HotSpot Editor
   Command Line:        C:\WINWORD\HELP\SHED.EXE
   Working Directory:   C:\WINWORD\HELP

   Description:         Help Compiler Errors
   Command Line:        C:\WINWORD\HELP\BLDERROR.HLP
   Working Directory:   C:\WINWORD\HELP

   Description:         Help Authoring Guide
   Command Line:        C:\WINWORD\HELP\HAG.HLP
   Working Directory:   C:\WINWORD\HELP

</PRE></OL>For this last item (HAG.EXE), an icon file is provided. To use it, click
the icon that you just created in the program group in Program Manager to
select it. Then choose Properties from the File menu, and select Change
Icon. In the File Name field, type the path and file name of the desired
icon (for example, C:\WINWORD\HELP\HAG.ICO), and choose OK.
<P>
<P><h3>Getting Started</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps to get started learning to use the Project
Editor and the WHAT6 template to create a new Windows Help File.

<OL><P><LI>Assuming you have set up icons for the installed components as
   described above, double click the Help Project Editor.

<P><LI>Choose Project from the Edit menu in the Project Editor.

<P><LI>In the Project Dialog box, create the Title and Contents description
   for your project. Use 3.1 as your help version, or the WHAT6 template
   won't be used. Choose OK when finished.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Add New or Existing File.

<P><LI>When the dialog box appears, type in a new file name with an .RTF
   extension. Choose OK.
<P>
   Choose Cancel if a dialog box appears with this message:
<P>
   "&lt;filename&gt;.RTF does not exist. Create it, based on WHAT30.DOT?"
<P>
   Return to Step 2. The project editor has not been set up correctly.
   Make sure you selected 3.1 as the help version.
<P>
   Everything is fine if a dialog appears with this message:
<P>
   "&lt;filename&gt;.RTF does not exist. Create it, based on WHAT6.DOT?"
<P>
   Choose OK. The file will then be added to the project list.

<P><LI>Select the file in the project list. Then from the Edit menu, choose
   Edit File. This will load Word version 6.0 for Windows and open your
   file using the WHAT6 template.

<P><LI>For further instruction on how to use the Help Project Editor or the
   WHAT6 template, please see the Help file provided for each of these
   tools by using the Help menu.
<P>
</OL><h3>Multiple Resolution Graphics</h3>
 
<P>
In addition to the .DOT and .HLP files, the WHAT6.EXE self-extracting
file also contains tools (SHED.EXE and MRBC.EXE) to help you compile
multi-resolution bitmaps (MRBMs) into your help file. You can use these
tools to make your graphics look good on monitors of various resolutions.
<P>
To create MRBMs, first take screen dumps of your graphic in each of the
resolutions you need (EGA, VGA, and 8514). Then create three separate .SHG
files using SHED.EXE (hotspot editor). Even if you don't have hotspots in
your graphic, create the separate *.SHG files. Then combine the three .SHG
graphics into one .MRB using MRBC.EXE.
<P>
When making this kind of file, be sure to archive the original .BMP and
.SHG files in case you need to modify anything later.
<P>
It is useful to use SHED even if you're not putting hotspots in the
graphic. SHED interprets graphics the same way WINHELP.EXE does. You can be
reasonably sure that once the graphics are saved in SHED, they will look
good in your Help file.
