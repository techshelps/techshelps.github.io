   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE>The errors listed above are the result of the Visual Basic 5.0 installation
program failing to install the control properly. This problem arises during
the installation of Visual Basic 5.0 when the installation program detects
that a component is already on the system. In this case, the installation
program will not install the component properly for use in the Visual Basic
5.0 design environment.
<P>
Components can already be on the system due to the installation of other
applications, including Visual Basic applications, which have already
installed these same components.

</PRE><h3>How To Use</h3>
 
<P>
Vbcmpfix is very simple to use. Run the self extracting Vbc.exe program,
which will extract two files:
<P>
<PRE>   Vbcmpfix.exe
   ReadMe.txt

</PRE>Double click Vbcmpfix.exe from the Windows Explorer, or run it from the
command line.
<P>
When Vbcmpfix launches, it will automatically detect which version of
Visual Basic you have installed on your system. If you do not have Visual
Basic installed, it will not allow you continue.
<P>
After it detects your version of Visual Basic, you can "Fix Install" or
"Quit". Choosing "Fix Install" will update your system so that the controls
and components that come with your edition of Visual Basic will work. The
controls and components that are fixed is dependent upon the edition of
Visual basic 5.0 you have installed.
<P>
After you have done this, close the utility and reboot your system. After
rebooting, launch Visual Basic 5 and try using any controls you were having
problems with.
<P>
<P><h3>Known Issues</h3>
 
<P>
Users of Internet Explorer 4.x might notice that their desktop goes crazy
after running Vbcmpfix.exe. Bitmaps might become black and/or colors will
be strange. Rebooting will solve this problem.
<P>
If you still cannot use controls after running Vbcmpfix.exe, please contact
Microsoft Visual Basic Technical Support. Re-run Vbcmpfix.exe and write
down the build number of the utility (given in the about box), and have
that handy in case they ask for it. Vbcmpfix will not work on systems that
have certain security settings, and Microsoft Visual Basic Technical
Support will assist you in resolving this problem.
<P>
If you install Visual Basic on a network, sometimes security settings will
carry over, and your system will not let Vbcmpfix.exe to run correctly.
