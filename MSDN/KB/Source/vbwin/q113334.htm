The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic
<PRE>  Programming System for Windows, version 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0 for Windows is available in Standard and
Professional Editions. This article summarizes the new features for Version
3.0 and the additional features available in the Professional Version.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual Basic Programming System version 3.0 for the Microsoft Windows
operating system provides easy access to a wide variety of data sources by
integrating the Microsoft Access version 1.1 database engine and the
ability to leverage investments in commercial applications through Object
Linking and Embedding (OLE). Visual Basic version 3.0 also adds new tools,
new controls, greater ease of use, and an enhanced custom control standard.
The development power and extensibility of Visual Basic version 3.0 coupled
with the strengths of Microsoft Access as an interactive application make
the two a great combination that can be used together on many projects,
including line-of-business, decision-support, and client-server solutions.
<P>
Both the Professional and Standard Editions of Visual Basic include the
features that have come to characterize Visual Basic as a powerful, easy to
use development environment. Pre-defined list boxes, text boxes,
file/directory/drive controls and drop down menus make the user interface
very easy to design. The following additions from version 2.0 apply to both
the Standard and Professional Editions of Visual Basic version 3.0.
<P>
<P><h3>New Features in Both the Standard and Professional Editions</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 1.1 Database Engine. The database engine
   provides direct access to Microsoft Access, Microsoft FoxPro, Borland
   dBASE, Borland Paradox, and Novell Btrieve databases.

<LI>Data control. The Data control provides a visual way for a programmer to
   issue a query and navigate through the results. Many other controls are
   now data-aware. User-interface controls can be bound to any one of
   several Data controls on a form without the programmer having to write
   any code.

<LI>Data-aware Controls (the Visual Layer). Data-aware controls, such as
   the text box, picture, image, label, check box, masked edit field, and
   3-D check box, can be linked directly to a query, providing an
   easy-to-use way to create the data-access portion of custom solutions
   without writing code. Visual Basic extensibility has been improved so
   that now third parties can also create data-aware controls.

<LI>The Data Manager. This tool provides a straightforward way to
   create and manipulate databases, tables, fields, indexes, and data, no
   matter what the format. The tool itself was written in Visual Basic
   3.0. See article <B><A HREF="../VBWIN/Q99643.htm">Q99643</A></B> for the current location of the file.

<LI>The Setup Wizard. This new tool automates the process of distributing
   applications. It scans the programmers project and determines which
   custom controls (.VBX files) and dynamic link libraries (DLLs) are
   required. Then it builds a custom set-up program complete with version
   checking, compresses all the files, and copies the compressed files to
   floppy disks.
<P>
</UL><h3>Features Available Only in the Professional Edition</h3>
 
<P>
The following features are available ONLY in the Professional version of
Visual Basic 3.0:

<UL><LI>Crystal Reports for Visual Basic. Crystal Reports version 2.0 for Visual
   Basic uses the Microsoft Access version 1.1 database engine for data
   access and includes a custom control to make embedding reports in
   applications easy. Programmers can design reports using the graphical
   WYSIWYG, banded report designer.

<LI>Data Access Objects (Programmatic Layer). A complete suite of
   objects gives programmers a versatile, easy-to-use programmatic layer
   that can drive the Microsoft Access Engine across a full range of
   functionality, including database definition as well as database
   manipulation.

<LI>Full Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) Support. Visual Basic 3.0
   Professional Edition provides access to client-server, host-based, and
   local databases and includes drivers for Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase
   SQL Server and ORACLE. ODBC drivers for Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase*
   SQL Server and ORACLE* are included with the Professional version.

<LI>The Outline control. This control makes it easy for programmers to use
   Visual Basic to create hierarchical list boxes like the controls
   found in Microsoft Windows File Manager or Microsoft Mail.

<LI>The OLE 2.0 control and OLE Automation. Object Linking and Embedding
   (OLE) makes it easy for developers to use commercial applications as a
   source of world-class, reusable objects.

<LI>Pop-up menus. Developers can easily create pop-up menus with just one
   line of code.

<LI>Language Improvements. The Visual Basic language is enhanced to
   support the new data-access capabilities and OLE 2.0 features.
<P>
</UL><h3>Custom Controls (.VBX files) Avaialble Only in the Professional Edition</h3>
 
<P>
Animated Button:  Displays a series of bitmaps that can create an animation
<PRE>                  effect when the user clicks the control.

</PRE>Communication  :  Provides complete serial communications for your
<PRE>                  applications, allowing the transmission and reception of
                  data through a serial port.

Gauge          :  Creates a user-defined gauge. The gauge indicator can be
                  displayed in linear of needle style.

Graph          :  Lets you design and display many different types and
                  styles of graphs.

Key Status     :  Displays and/or modifies the state of the CAPS LOCK, NUM
                  LOCK, INS and SCROLL LOCK keys.

</PRE>MAPI Controls  :  Lets you create mail-enabled Visual Basic programs using
<PRE>                  the Messaging Application Program Interface (MAPI). The
                  MAPI Session control begins and ends a messaging session.
                  The MAPI Messages control allows you to handle messages
                  as well as manipulate attachments and addresses.

Masked Edit    :  Restricts data input and displays formatted output.
                  Similar to the standard text box.

</PRE>Multimedia MCI :  Manages the recording and playback of multimedia files on
<PRE>                  Media Control Interface (MCI) devices.

Outline        :  Similar to the standard list box. Allows you to display
                  items in a list hierarchically. Subordinate items can be
                  expanded and collapsed.

Pen controls   :  Lets you develop Windows for Pen Computing applications.
                  Pen Bedit provides combo or box style guides that accept
                  pen input. Pen HEditis a pen-enhanced version of the
                  standard text box. Pen Ink on Bitmap accepts and save pen
                  input over an existing bitmap. Pen On-screen Keyboard
                  enables the use of the Windows for Pen Computing
                  synthetic keyboard for input to the active control.

Picture Clip   :  Displays a portion of a source bitmap in a form or
                  picture box.

Spin Button    :  Increments or decrements numbers displayed in a text box
                  or other control.

3D Controls    :  Replace standard controls with flexible three-dimensional
                  controls. The 3D Check Box, 3D Command Button, 3D Frame,
                  and 3D Option Button work like the standard controls but
                  allow you to display three-dimensional captions and text.
                  The 3D Command Button also lets you show an icon or
                  bitmap on the button face. The 3D Panel lets you group
                  controls on a raised or inset panel. With the 3D Group
                  Push Button you can emulate the Ribbon in Microsoft Excel
                  or the Toolbar in Microsoft Word for Windows.
