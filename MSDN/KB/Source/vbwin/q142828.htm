The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual
   Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following pairs of bitmaps that come with Visual Basic are identical,
but they should be different:
<P>
<PRE>   \bitmaps\outline\open.bmp      AND    \bitmaps\tlbr_w95\open.bmp
   (222 bytes)                  (246 bytes)

   \bitmaps\assorted\delete.bmp   AND    \bitmaps\tlbr_w95\delete.bmp
   (382 bytes)                  (246 bytes)

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Although they are not installed correctly, there are two different versions
of Open.bmp and Delete.bmp included on the distribution media for Visual
Basic 4.0. The Extract.exe program, which comes with Visual Basic, can be
used to extract the Windows 95 toolbar versions of Open.bmp and Delete.bmp
from the installation disks or CD. These files can then be copied over the
files in the tlbr_w95 directory.
<P>
To extract the Open.bmp file, open an MS-DOS command window, change to the
drive that your installation disk resides in, and enter the following line:
extract /a /e /l c:\temp vb4-1.cab open.bmp where c:\temp is the name of a
temporary directory that the new copy of Open.bmp will be extracted to. The
<PRE>'/a' switch tells Extract.exe to search all .cab files for the file(s)
</PRE>specified.
<P>
After pressing ENTER, Extract.exe starts searching, and finds and extracts
the first copy of Open.bmp (which is already installed). It continues
searching and finds the second copy, at which point it will ask if it's ok
to overwrite Open.bmp. Choose OK and let Extract.exe finish up. The second
version of Open.bmp now resides in the directory specified in the command.
All that remains now is to copy it to the tlbr_w95 subdirectory. Repeat the
same steps to extract the other version of Delete.bmp. For more information
on Extract.exe enter 'extract /?' at a command prompt.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic, or if it is already running, choose New Project from
   the File menu.

<P><LI>Double-click twice on the Image button in the Toolbox to add two image
   controls to the form. Move one of the image controls so both are
   visible.

<P><LI>Change the Picture property of Image1 to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;path to your VB directory&gt;\bitmaps\outline\open.bmp
</PRE>
<P><LI>Change the Picture property of Image2 to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;path to your VB directory&gt;\bitmaps\tlbr_w95\open.bmp
</PRE><P>
</OL>The pictures in the two image controls should be different, but they're
not.
<P>
Manually extracting the second Open.bmp from the installation disks or CD
will allow access to both bitmaps.
