The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows,
<PRE>  versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows debugging tools listed in this article may help you
debug and troubleshoot problems such as general protection (GP) faults
that you encounter while in Visual Basic or while executing a compiled
Visual Basic program.
<P>
None of these tools are included as part of the Microsoft Visual Basic
programming system for Windows, but they are readily available from other
sources as listed in each tool's description. You can use these tools to
debug many different problems, including but not limited to GP faults.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following tools may help you debug your Visual Basic programs. A brief
description of each tool is given below. For more information, review the
Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Dr. Watson for Windows (DRWATSON.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
This tool comes with Microsoft Windows version 3.1. It is located in the
\WINDOWS directory. This is a diagnostic tool for the Microsoft Windows
operating system. It detects system and application failures caused by
Windows applications and can store information in a disk file called a log
file. There is more information in the Programming Tools Manual in Chapter
6 of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit for Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>CodeView for Windows (CVW.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
This tool comes with the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit for
Windows version 3.1. You cannot use this tool to debug Visual Basic
programs, but you can use it to debug dynamic link libraries (DLLs) used
by Visual Basic. For example, you can use this tool to test the execution
of your application and examine your data simultaneously.
<P>
You can isolate problems quickly because you can display any combination
of variables, global or local, while you interrupt or trace an
application's execution. For information on how to use CodeView for
Windows, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>  codeview and visual and basic

</PRE>Also, there is more information in the Programming Tools Manual in Chapter
4 of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit for Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Heap Walker (HEAPWALK.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
This tool comes with the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit for
Windows 3.1. Use it to test how memory is being allocated. It checks
memory by examining the global heap (the system memory that the Windows
operating system uses), local heaps used by active applications, and
DLLs in your Windows system.
<P>
Heap Walker is useful for analyzing the effects your application has when
it allocates memory from the global heap or when it creates user interface
objects or graphics objects. There is more information in the Programming
Tools Manual in Chapter 9 of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
for Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Windows SPY (SPY.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
This tool comes with the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit for
Windows 3.1. Use it to test or monitor messages sent to one or more windows
in Microsoft Windows and to examine the values of message parameters. For
more information, see the Programming Tools Manual in Chapter 7 of the
Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit for Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Dynamic Data Exchange Spy (DDESPY.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
This tool comes with the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit for
Windows 3.1. Use it to test or monitor dynamic data exchange messages and
activity between two windows applications in the Microsoft Windows
operating system. You can use DDESPY.EXE to trace DDE messages in Microsoft
Windows. For more information, see the Programming Tools Manual in Chapter
8 of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit for Windows 3.1.
