The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows, version 3.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Binding a masked edit control (MSMASKED.VBX) to a data control can
result in the error "Invalid property value" when the form is loaded.
Also, the error "Type mismatch" can occur when you attempt to update a
record. For example, this problem can occur when a masked edit control
is bound to a date field and has the mask ##/##/##.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Visual Basic uses the Text property of a bound masked edit control to
transfer data to and from the data control. This requires strict
compatibility, character for character, between the Mask property and
the format of the data in the database. For example, dates are stored in
a database as a numeric value, not as a string of the format dd/mm/yy.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Bind an invisible text box to the data control instead of binding the
masked edit control. Then transfer data between the text box and the
masked edit control. This allows you precise control over the format of
the data for the masked edit control making it appear as if the masked
edit control is bound.
<P>
This alternative approach involves more lines of code and complexity,
but it should prove much more flexible and forgiving. Below is an example
showing how to use this technique with a date field.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a bound masked edit control tries to pull data in from a data
control, it behaves differently depending upon the PromptInclude property
of the masked edit control.

<UL><LI>If PromptInclude is True (the default), the data coming from the data
   control must match the mask property exactly or an "Invalid property
   value" error occurs. If a user tries to change a valid value in a bound
   masked edit control and doesn't entirely fill up the masked edit
   control, the error "Type mismatch" occurs upon writing values into
   a numeric data type field of a database.

<LI>If PromptInclude is False, the masked edit control does not require or
   provide literal characters from the Mask property. In other words, the
   Text property operates like ClipText. For example, a Mask of ##/##/##
   receives the date 1/2/93 into the Text property as 12/93/__.
<P>
</UL>The only time it would be advisable to bind a masked edit control directly
to a data source would be when you are binding the masked edit control to
a fixed-length primary key field; that is, a field that holds a unique
value for each record in a table, and that value is always a fixed number
of characters in length -- for example, a serial number or product
identification code)
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example for the Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
This example shows how to use the Masked edit control with an Access
database. This particular example demonstrates using the masked edit
control on a field of data type Date/Time.
<P>
Before testing the example, either load DATAMGR.EXE (located in the
\VB directory) or run VISDATA.MAK (located in the \VB\SAMPLES\VISDATA
directory.) Open the BIBLIO.MDB sample database by selecting it after
choosing Open Database from the File menu and selecting the Access
database option.
<P>
Next, select the Authors table, and click the Design button. Select the
Add button, enter 'Dates' for the field name, and select the Date/Time
for the field type. Then choose OK to close the Add Field window, and
then click the Open button. Add several dates to the 'Dates' field in
an 'mm/dd/yy' format. You may leave some of the 'Dates' fields blank,
but you should enter at least five different dates of five different
records in the Authors table to test the example.
<P>
Now, you are ready to complete the example:

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic for Windows, or from the File menu, choose New
   Project (ALT, F, N) if Visual Basic for Windows is already running.
   Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add the following controls with the associated properties to Form1:
<P>
<PRE>   Control       Name           Property Settings
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   Data          Data1          DatabaseName = "BIBLIO.MDB"

                                   added to BIBLIO.MDB previously

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following lines of code to the (general)(declarations)
   section of Form1:

   Const MAXMASKLEN = 6        ' This constant is the maximum number of
                               ' characters the user can enter in this
                               ' particular MaskedEdit.

   Function IsValidDate% (MyMask As MaskEdBox, MaskFullLen As Integer)
   ' This function checks the validity of a date in a Masked edit control.
   ' It returns a zero if the FormattedText is not a valid date, a one
   ' if the field is empty, and a two if the FormattedText is valid.
   '
   ' Parameters:
   '    MyMask       - the Masked edit control being checked
   '    MaskFullLen  - max. number of chars the Masked edit control can
hold

      If MyMask.Text = "" Then
         IsValidDate% = 1
      ElseIf Len(MyMask.Text) = MaskFullLen Then
         If IsDate(MyMask.FormattedText) Then
            IsValidDate% = 2
         End If
      Else
        IsValidDate% = 0
      End If
   End Function

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the Load event of Form1:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Form_Load ()

      UpdFlag = False

   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the Validate Event of the Data1 Control:

         Action = DATA_ACTIONCANCEL         'don't allow changes
         MaskedEdit1.SetFocus

      ' The invisible text box can get changed two ways: from the
      ' database because it is bound or from the MaskedEdit when pushing
      ' values back into the data control. This condition handles the
      ' situation when the data is coming from the database and the
      ' MaskedEdit needs to be updated.

      If Not UpdFlag Then
         If Text1.Text = "" Then            ' If NULL condition  then
            MaskedEdit1.Text = ""           ' Set the MaskedEdit to ""
         Else
            MaskedEdit1.Text = Format$(Text1.Text, DATEFMT) 'Format output.
         End If
      End If
      UpdFlag = False

   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Press the F5 key to run the program. The masked edit control should
   behave as if it was bound to the data control.
<P>
   NOTE: This example verifies that the dates are valid in the Validate
   event before actually placing the dates in the database.
