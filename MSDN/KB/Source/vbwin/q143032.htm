The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic, version 4.0, for
   Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Trying to simultaneously execute a second query on the same rdoConnection
that currently has an asynchronous query executing will cause the following
error:
<P>
<PRE>   S1000: [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Connection is busy with
   results for another hstmt

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
After you execute an asynchronous query you cannot access the recordset or
execute another asynchronous query on the same rdoConnection until the
StillExecuting property of the recordset is False. This behavior is by
design.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You need to allow for the asynchronous query to finish before executing
another query on the same rdoConnection or accessing the recordset object.
<P>
You can check to see if the query is finished by checking the
StillExecuting property of the recordset. This can also be resolved by
opening a separate rdoConnection for each query you want to execute
simultaneously.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Steps to Reproduce Problem in Visual Basic Version 4.0:
<P>
This example uses a "DSN-less" ODBC connection so you will not need to set
up a DSN with the ODBC Admin utility.

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add two command buttons to Form1.

<P><LI>Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of form1.
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub Command1_Click()
     'The following code will cause the error:
     Dim en As rdoEnvironment
     Dim cn As rdoConnection
     Dim rs1 As rdoResultset
     Dim rs2 As rdoResultset
     Dim sql1 As String
     Dim sql2 As String

     'establish connection
     Set en = rdoEngine.rdoEnvironments(0)
     en.CursorDriver = rdUseOdbc
     'this should be modified to connect to your database
     Dim cnStr As String

       Option:=rdAsyncEnable)

     While rs1.StillExecuting Or rs2.StillExecuting
       DoEvents
     Wend
     MsgBox "rs1 and rs1 have both completed"
   End Sub


   Private Sub Command2_Click()
     'The following code will not cause the error:
     Dim en As rdoEnvironment
     Dim cn1 As rdoConnection
     Dim cn2 As rdoConnection  'a second connection has been added
     Dim rs1 As rdoResultset
     Dim rs2 As rdoResultset
     Dim sql1 As String
     Dim sql2 As String

     'establish connection
     Set en = rdoEngine.rdoEnvironments(0)
     en.CursorDriver = rdUseOdbc
     'this should be modified to connect to your database
     Dim cnStr As String
     cnStr = "driver={SQL Server};server=myserver;" &amp; _
       "database=pubs;uid=myuid;pwd=mypwd"

       Connect:=cnStr)
     Set cn2 = en.OpenConnection(dsname:="", Prompt:=rdDriverNoPrompt, _
       Connect:=cnStr)

     'create SQL statements that take at least a few seconds to finish
     sql1 = "Select title From Titles"
     Set rs1 = cn1.OpenResultset(Name:=sql1, Type:=rdOpenStatic, _

     Set rs2 = cn2.OpenResultset(Name:=sql2, Type:=rdOpenStatic, _
       Option:=rdAsyncEnable)

     While rs1.StillExecuting Or rs2.StillExecuting
       DoEvents
     Wend
     MsgBox "rs1 and rs1 have both completed"
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Note that you will need to change your DRIVER, SERVER, DATABASE, UID,
   and PWD in the OpenConnection method. You will also need to modify the
   SQL statement contained in the Command1_Click event to match your own
   SQL data source.

<P><LI>Clicking on Command1 will cause the error: "Connection is busy with
   results for another hstmt." This is because you are trying to
   simultaneously execute a second query on the same rdoConnection.
   Clicking on Command2 will successfully execute each query simultaneously
   because they are each on a separate rdoConnection.
