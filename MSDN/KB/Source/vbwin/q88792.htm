The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
   Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When an option button or group of option buttons is initially placed
on a form in Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows, the buttons will
remain unselected until the focus is shifted to one of the option
buttons. This can cause unexpected results, because shifting the focus
to one of the option buttons will invoke a Click event for that option
button.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use either the following methods to work around this feature:
<P>
In design mode, you must manually set the Value property for one of the
option buttons to True.
<P>
-or-
<P>
If you have more controls on the form, you can set one of the controls with
a tabindex property to 0. Therefore, when switching between forms, the
focus will not automatically go to the first button.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In a group of option buttons, one of the buttons should be selected unless
the option buttons apply to only certain selected objects on the current
form. In this case, the option buttons, when initially displayed, would
not be selected.
<P>
Visual Basic for Windows will allow option buttons to be placed on a
form without selecting any of the option buttons. If you desire to
create a group of option buttons with none of them selected, there is
no way to prevent a Click event from being invoked when the focus is
shifted to one of them. A problem may occur when an unselected option
button is first in the tab order. The option button will automatically
get selected when the form is shown. In all cases, to prevent the
Click event from occurring, in design mode, you must set the Value
property of one of the option buttons to True.
<P>
The following steps demonstrate this feature, as well as a way to
work around this feature:
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT, F, N)
   if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Set the AutoRedraw property for Form1 to True. This prevents any text
   printed to the screen from being overwritten when Windows redraws the
   form.

<P><LI>Create one or more option buttons on Form1.

<P><LI>In the Click event procedure for the first option button, insert the
   following code:
<P>
<P><PRE>     PRINT "Option Button Clicked"
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Run menu, choose Start (ALT, R, S) to run the program.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The Click event is invoked when the form is shown and the focus is
given to the first option button. To work around this problem, after
creating the option buttons in step 2, set the Value property of one of the
option buttons to True.
