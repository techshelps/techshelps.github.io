<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Below is an example showing that the Click and LostFocus events occur in
different order depending upon whether you cause the click event with the
mouse or the keyboard (with an access key). This behavior is by design.
<P>
When the focus changes between controls, the Click event can occur
before the LostFocus event in some situations. This is mainly because
certain events (including GotFocus, LostFocus, and clicking the button
with the mouse) are posted to a message queue and other events, such as
ALT+V from the keyboard, are issued directly.
<P>
To force the code for the LostFocus event to always execute before the
Click event code, place a DoEvents statement at the beginning of the Click
event code.
<P>

<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
1. Draw a text box (Text1) and a command button (Command1) on the default
<PRE>   Form1.

</PRE><P><LI>Set the Caption property of Command1 to &amp;Valid. The &amp;V sets up the ALT+V
   as a way to execute the Command1 button from the keyboard.

<P><LI>Add a Beep statement to the Text1_LostFocus event procedure.

<P><LI>Add an End statement to the Command1_Click event procedure.

<P><LI>Press F5 to run the program. The focus starts by default on the Text1
   box. Click the Command1 button, and notice that the LostFocus event
   occurs and you hear a Beep before the program ends.

<P><LI>Press F5 to run the program again. The focus starts by default on the
   Text1 box. Type ALT+V to activate the Command1 button. Notice that the
   program ends with no LostFocus event (no beep).
<P>
</OL>The difference in behavior is not a bug. It is by design.
<P>
In order make the Text1_LostFocus event occur first, place a DoEvents
statement (or function) at the beginning of the Click event code for
the Command1 button.
