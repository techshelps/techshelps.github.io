The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Professional and Enterprise Editions for
   Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions,
   16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You might think that you could change the letter case of a control name by
changing the value of the Name property of the control in the Property
Browser, or by using the Edit/Replace feature to find and replace all
instances of the control name. However, the first method does not work at
all if you have existing code, and the second method does not work in all
cases either. This article shows you how to use a combination of methods to
accomplish the change.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes three methods to change the case of control
references in code:

<UL><LI>Rename the Control
<LI>Find and Replace
<LI>Temporarily Dimension a Variable
<P>
</UL><h3>Rename the Control</h3>
 
<P>
This method works only if you have made no references to the control in
your code. Once you make any reference in code to a control, the editor
remembers the control's name and case. Changing the case of the control
name after this point does not affect existing or new code.
<P>
<P><h3>Find and Replace</h3>
 
<P>
You can use the Edit/Replace feature to find and replace all instances of
the control name with the new case.
<P>
NOTE: This technique does not work in every case. When you add new event
procedures, the old case is used. When combined with the next technique,
you can change the case of all existing and new references to the control.
<P>
<P><h3>Temporarily Dimension a Variable</h3>
 
<P>
The editor is designed so that all references to a variable name use the
same case as the statement in which the variable is dimensioned.
<P>
For example, type the following inside a code window:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim MyVariable as string
   myvariable = "hello"     ' is changed to MyVariable = "hello"

</PRE>To change the letter case of a variable, you must change its letter case
within the dimension statement. In the previous example, to change
MyVariable to Myvariable, alter the first line to:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim Myvariable as String

</PRE>You can take advantage of this feature to change the letter case of a
control's name. Just dimension a variable of the desired name and case.
After you press ENTER, the case will change throughout the code window.
Then simply delete the unnecessary dimension statement.
<P>
NOTE: This technique does not work in every case. It does not change the
name of existing event procedure names because they are a compound name.
However, new event procedure names will reflect the new case. When combined
with the previous technique, you can change the case of all existing and
new references to the control.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps show how to change the case of Command1 to command1 by
using a combination of the second and third techniques:

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic and add a command button (Command1)
   to the default form.

<P><LI>Add the following line of code to the Command1_Click Event:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Command1.Caption = "hello"
</PRE>
<P><LI>Change the name property of the command button from Command1 to
   command1. Note the code has not changed case.

<P><LI>Add the following line of code to the Command1_Click event and press
   ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Dim command1 as string
</PRE>
<P><LI>Note the case of the Command.Caption reference has been changed.
   However, the case of the event procedure name, Command1_Click, has not.

<P><LI>Delete the line added in step 4. The change will remain in effect until
   another variable is dimensioned with a different case. If you leave the
   line in the program, you will receive an error when the program is
   compiled.

<P><LI>Add a new event procedure, Command_GotFocus. Note that the new event
   procedure reflects the new case.

<P><LI>You can change the case of existing event procedures manually, or you
   can use the Edit/Replace dialog box to search for "Sub Command1_" and
   replace it with "Sub command1_".
