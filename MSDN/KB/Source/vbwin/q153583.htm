<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You might think that you could change the letter case of a control name by
changing the value of the Name property of the control in the Property
Browser. However, this does not work. This article shows you how to do it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By design, the letter case of a variable as designated when dimensioning it
will be the letter case throughout the project. For example, type the
following inside a code window:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim MyVariable as string
   myvariable = "hello"     ' will be changed to MyVariable = "hello"

</PRE>To change the letter case of a variable, you must change its letter case
within the dimension statement. Therefore, in the previous example, to
change MyVariable to Myvariable, type the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim Myvariable as String

</PRE>You can use this fact to change the letter case of a control's name. Just
dimension a variable of the desired name and case. After you press ENTER,
the case will change throughout the code window. Then simply delete the
unnecessary dimension statement.
<P>
The following shows how to change the case of Command1 to command1 by a
step-by-step example:
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-step example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 will be added by default.

<P><LI>Add a command button on Form1.

<P><LI>Add the following line of code to the Form_Click Event:
<P>
   Command1.Caption = "hello"

<P><LI>Add the following line of code to the Form_Click event and press ENTER.
<P>
   Dim command1 as string

<P><LI>The case should now be as just entered i.e
<P>
   command1.Caption = "hello"

<P><LI>Delete the following line of code from the Form_Click event now that it
   is no longer needed:
<P>
   Dim command1 as string
<P></OL>
