The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation, Learning, Professional, and
   Enterprise Editions for Windows, version 5.0
   on the following platforms: NT, Win95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Attempting to set the default printer to an object variable has no
effect. For instance, given a system with more than one printer installed,
the following code will not change the default printer:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub Form_Load()
       Dim Prt As Printer
       For Each Prt In Printers
      If Not Prt Is Printer Then
            Set Printer = Prt
         Exit For
      End If
       Next

      Printer.Print "Hi, Mom"
      Printer.EndDoc
   End Sub

</PRE>The expected behavior is that the document should print to the first non-
default printer found in the printers collection.
<P>
The actual behavior is that the document prints to the original default
printer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
*CAUTION* This workaround changes the default printer for all applications
that are currently running.
<P>
The following code provides a means to determine which printers are
available, and to designate one as the default printer.
