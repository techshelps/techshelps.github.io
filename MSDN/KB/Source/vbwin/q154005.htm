<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to use the Visual Basic function called KILL to
enable a user to delete a file from disk. Under Windows 95, there is an
additional feature of deleting files into the Recycle bin, giving a user
the ability to reclaim deleted files. The KILL function doesn't offer this
to the Visual Basic Programmer, but the SHFileOperation Win32 API does.
Below is a code sample showing how to use the API in Visual Basic.

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Place a Command button on Form1.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Form1 code window:
<P>
   Option Explicit
<P>
   Private Type SHFILEOPSTRUCT
<P><PRE>     hwnd As Long
     wFunc As Long
     pFrom As String
     pTo As String
     fFlags As Integer
     fAnyOperationsAborted As Boolean
     hNameMappings As Long
     lpszProgressTitle As String
</PRE>   End Type
<P>
<PRE>   Private Declare Function SHFileOperation Lib "shell32.dll" Alias _
     "SHFileOperationA" (lpFileOp As SHFILEOPSTRUCT) As Long
   Private Declare Function GetTempFileName Lib "kernel32" _
     Alias "GetTempFileNameA" (ByVal lpszPath As String, _

   Private Const FO_DELETE = &amp;H3
   Private Const FOF_ALLOWUNDO = &amp;H40

   Sub Command1_Click()

     MsgBox "View your Recycle Bin for files beginning with VB_"
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Press the F5 key to run the project, and click the Command button. You
   will be prompted to confirm the deletion of the file. In your Recycle
   Bin, there will be a file with the prefix "VB_" that is the file created
   by the GetTempFileName Win32 API call.
