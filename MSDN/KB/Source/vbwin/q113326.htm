The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic
<PRE>  for Windows, version 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may get the following error when loading a project that contains the
Spin custom control into Visual Basic, when loading the SPIN.VBX file
into Visual Basic, or when running an existing .EXE file that uses the
Spin custom control:
<P>
<PRE>     Can't load Custom Control DLL: 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\SPIN.VBX'

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
We have had reports that customers have had conflict with the following
products that are not manufactured by Microsoft:

<UL><LI>Custom Cursor Deluxe, from Micro Speed, FreeMont, CA (510-490-1403)

<LI>OriginFx Screen Save, from Origin Systems Inc.
<P>
</UL>In both cases, the products used a SPIN.DLL that was loaded before the
SPIN.VBX load was attempted. Windows will not allow two DLLs of the same
name, so whichever is second fails to load.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Simply renaming the SPIN.VBX file will not fix the problem. The name that
is loaded into memory will still be SPIN even if the .VBX file name is
changed. This is something that would have to be changed when rebuilding
the file.
<P>
If users of these conflicting files are attempting to run finished
applications which use these 'Spin' files, they will not be able to run
both programs simultaneously in Windows.
<P>
If the programs are run one at a time -- that is, the first is loaded and
then unloaded before the second is invoked -- and the problem persists, it
may be necessary to do an explicit FreeModule call to release the
previously loaded .VBX or .DLL file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
As far as Windows is concerned, this is by design. You are not allowed to
load two DLLs (a VBX is loaded the same as a DLL) with the same name.
<P>
