The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft
   Visual Basic, 32-bit only, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When file extensions are hidden under Microsoft Windows 95, saving a
project or file in Visual Basic with the Save As option may cause the file
extension to be lost. In this case, Windows 95 loses the ability to
recognize the type of the Visual Basic file or even to associate the file
with Visual Basic.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Either of the following methods can be used to resolve this problem:
<P>
In the Windows Explorer, click Options on the View menu. Then uncheck
the "Hide MS-DOS file extensions for file types that are registered"
option. When this option is used, the display in the Windows Explorer
always shows any file extensions, and it also changes the default behavior
of the file common dialog boxes. With this option unchecked, the Save As
dialog box shows the Visual Basic file extension by default, and all files
are saved and associated properly.
<P>
- or -
<P>
If you would like to keep the behavior offered by this option, you can work
around this problem by manually adding the relevant file extension to each
file and project you save with the Save As command. You must remember to
append the correct extension to every file and project that is saved.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of the article. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to reproduce problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI> Start Windows Explorer.

<P><LI> On the Windows Explorer's View menu, click Options.

<P><LI> Make sure the "Hide MS-DOS file extensions for file types that are
<P><PRE>    registered" option is checked and click OK.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Start Visual Basic (32-bit) running under Windows 95.

<P><LI> On the Visual Basic File menu, click Open Project.

<P><LI> Switch to the Samples\CallDLLs subdirectory and open the CallDLLs
<P><PRE>    project.
</PRE>
<P><LI> On the File menu, click Save File As.

<P><LI> Switch to a different directory and click OK to save the selected form
<P><PRE>    from the CallDLLs sample application.
</PRE>
<P><LI> In the Windows Explorer, change to and view the directory you just
<P><PRE>    saved the form to. A file now exists with the correct name, but it does
    not exhibit the correct icon for a Visual Basic Form file, nor does it
    show the correct Type in its Properties dialog box. Turning off
    the Explorer option and saving the file again fixes the problem (note
    that the old saved file is not deleted and no message appears asking
    if it is OK to overwrite the original file because as far as Windows 95
    is concerned, the two files are completely different entities).
