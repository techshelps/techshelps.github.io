The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE>- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 1.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you change the decimal separator by choosing the International icon from
the Windows Control Panel, you can get the error "Errors during load. Refer
to ..." when loading a form that was saved as text.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Microsoft Visual Basic
version 2.0 for Windows. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual
Basic version 3.0 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
From the Windows Control Panel, you can change the decimal separator for
numbers by choosing the International icon. By changing the decimal
separator, you can affect the way decimal numbers look when output by
statements such as the PRINT method.
<P>
However, if you change the decimal separator, you may get the following
error when you load a form that had was saved as text (the default):
"Errors during load. Refer to" followed by the name of a log file that
contains the error information.
<P>
When a form is saved as text, all information about the form is saved
to the file, this includes all the properties that were changed from
their default. Any properties that where written as a decimal number,
such as the FontSize property, may not be recognized if you have
changed the decimal separator.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start the Windows Control Panel located, by default, in the Main group
   of the Windows Program Manager.

<P><LI>Choose the International icon from the Control Panel to specify
   international settings.

<P><LI>Choose the Change button next to Number Format.

<P><LI>Change the decimal separator to a comma (,).

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Visual Basic version 2.0.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open Project (Press ALT, F, O).

<P><LI>Open the Calculator sample program. This is installed in the SAMPLES
   directory under the CALC subdirectory.

<P><LI>From the Project Window, double-click CALC.FRM to load the form.
<P>
</OL>At this point, you should get the error "Errors during load. Refer to"
followed by the name of a log file that contains the error information.
Note that although the loading problem was corrected in Visual Basic
version 3.0, the Calculator program is not designed ot accept a comma (,)
in place of a decimal point. Using a comma causes a "Type mismatch" error.
