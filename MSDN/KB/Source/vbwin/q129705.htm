The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft
   Visual Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When using Visual Basic for Windows with Double-Byte Character Sets (DBCS)
of different languages, characters from a language that does not use the
same character set as the current localized operating system version will
not be available and may cause problems.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Visual Basic, edits to any foreign language must be made from that
language's localized operating system because not all characters are valid
and visible from every language. For example, some extended characters in
French are valid leading bytes for DBCS, so they eat up the next character
and create (or appear as) a invalid DBCS character.
<P>
Additionally, you can only enter DBCS characters from a DBCS version of
Visual Basic on a DBCS localized operating system.
<P>
This essentially means that if you want to view or access double-byte
characters by using the System font on a DBCS operating system, the font
you choose on your U.S. operating system must be one that is available on a
DBCS operating system. This limits the choices to "System" font and (for
some localized versions) and "Terminal."
<P>
NOTE: There is also a difference in default font sizes on Japanese
machines. The display system is different on Japanese machines. Therefore,
some dialog text or button captions may appear cut off on DBCS displays if
this is not accounted for at design time.
