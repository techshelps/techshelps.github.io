The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Attempting to update the same record at the same time by two different
clients produces an error for one of the clients, and the record is not
updated. The following should occur:
<P>
<PRE>   "Runtime-error 40002 01503:[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL
   Server]Optimistic concurrency check failed, the row was modified outside
   of this cursor"

</PRE>However, if a SQL server text field is part of the update, the update will
not occur in one of the clients, but no error will be returned to let the
user know that the update did not occur.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Place a timestamp field in the table and use a SQL Server stored procedure
that compares the timestamp field to the one returned by the result set. An
error will be returned by the stored procedure if an attempt is made to
update the same record with a different timestamp.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The steps below illustrate the problem and the solution. You will need to
run two instances of the project. To see the problem, click Command1,
Command2, and Command3 in one instance of the project, and click Command1,
Command2 and Command4 in the second instance of the project. Then click
Command4 to update the record in the first instance.
<P>
To work around this problem, use the stored procedure by clicking Command1
in the first instance and then Command1 and Command5 in the second
instance, followed by Command5 in the first instance. The stored procedure
compares the original timestamp and refuses to update the field.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Modify the pub_info table in the pubs database so that it contains a
   timestamp field. Edit the first record. Use the following code in
   ISQL-W to accomplish this:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Alter table pubs.dbo.pub_info add pub_name char(10) null,
<PRE></PRE>           whattime timestamp null

   After you have run the above successfully in ISQL-W, run the following
   by itself in ISQL-W:

      Update pub_info set pub_name= "MSPress" where pub_id= "0736"

   The code above will insert a timestamp field in the table and a value
   in that field for the first record where the pub_id is 0736. If the
   first record has a different pub_id value, use that value instead. This
   will also place a value in the timestamp field.

</PRE><P><LI>Create the following stored procedure using ISQL-W:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CREATE PROCEDURE updat_pub_info  @id char(4), @mytext text,
<PRE></PRE>          @pname char(10), @thyme timestamp
      AS
      update pub_info
         set  pr_info= @mytext,
             pub_name= @pname
         where pub_id= @id and tsequal(@thyme,whattime)

</PRE><P><LI>Create a new project and, under References, check Microsoft Remote Data
   Objects 2.0.

<P><LI>Add six command buttons to the form and paste the following code in the
   General Declarations section of the form:
<P>
<P><PRE>       Option Explicit
       Dim en As rdoEnvironment
       Dim rs As rdoResultset
       Dim cn As rdoConnection
       Dim qr As rdoQuery
       Dim sqlstr As String
       Dim mytime As Variant
       Private Sub Command1_Click()
<PRE></PRE>        sqlstr = "select pub_id, pub_name, pr_info, whattime from pub_info"
        Set rs = cn.OpenResultset(sqlstr, rdOpenKeyset, _
           rdConcurRowVer, rdExecDirect)
        mytime = rs(3)  'needed to send the timestamp back to the procedure
       End Sub
      Private Sub Command2_Click()
        rs.Edit
        rs(1) = "testing"   'update the char field, change in 2nd instance
      End Sub
      Private Sub Command3_Click()
         rs(2) = "mmmmmmmmmm" 'update the text field,change in 2nd instance
      End Sub
      Private Sub Command4_Click()
         rs.Update
      End Sub
      Private Sub Command5_Click()
       'On Error GoTo myerr 'uncomment to trap error
          Set qr = cn.CreateQuery _
             ("", "{call updat_pub_info(?,?,?,?)}")
          qr.rdoParameters(0).Direction = rdParamInput
          qr.rdoParameters(1).Direction = rdParamInput
          qr.rdoParameters(2).Direction = rdParamInput
          qr.rdoParameters(3).Direction = rdParamInput
          qr(0) = "0736"
          qr(1) = "QUE"
          qr(2) = "This is a third text field"
          qr(3) = mytime  'variant type will compare to timestamp
          qr.Execute
          Exit Sub
          On Error GoTo 0
      myerr:
         MsgBox Err.number
      End Sub

      Private Sub Command6_Click()
        If Not (rs Is Nothing) Then
          rs.Close
        End If
        cn.Close
        Unload Me
      End Sub

      Private Sub Form_Load()
        Set en = rdoEnvironments(0)
        'change dsName to the data source name in your odbc administrator
        Set cn = en.OpenConnection(dsName:="mymachine", _
            Prompt:=rdDriverNoPrompt, _
            Connect:="uid=sa;pwd=;database=PUBS;")
        Command1.Caption = "resultset"
        Command2.Caption = "edit char field"
        Command3.Caption = "edit text field"
        Command4.Caption = "update"
        Command5.Caption = "update stor proc"
        Command6.Caption = "quit"
     End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run two instances of this project. You will want to save the project
   twice with different names or create two different executables to run.

<P><LI>Click Command1 and Command2 in the first instance, and Command1,
   Command2, and Command4 in the second instance. Click Command4 in
   the first instance and note that you get the error message indicated
   above.

<P><LI>Click Command1, Command2, and Command3 in the first instance, and
   Command1, Command2, and Command4 in the second instance. Click
   Command4 in the first instance and note that no error message is
   returned.
<P>
   If you change what rs(1) is set equal to in one of the applications,
   you will see that the second instance has updated pub_info, but the
   first instance has not, and no error message was returned.

<P><LI>To work around this problem, try clicking Command1 in the first
   instance. Click Command1 and Command5 in the second instance and
   then Command5 in the first instance. An error message is returned
   about the timestamp field if the error is not trapped.
