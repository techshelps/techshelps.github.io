The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 3.0
- Microsoft Jet 2.0/Visual Basic 3.0 Compatibility Layer
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article gives the complete text contents (with corrections) of the
fact sheet for the Microsoft Jet 2.0/Visual Basic 3.0 Compatibility Layer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Background Information</h3>
 
<P>
Visual Basic version 3.0, released in May of 1993, includes support for the
Microsoft Access version 1.1 database engine, also known as the Microsoft
Jet Database Engine (Jet). The Jet database engine gives Visual Basic
developers the ability to create and distribute royalty- free applications
with Jet as the underlying database engine. Microsoft Access version 2.0
contains a new version (2.0) of the Jet database engine that Visual Basic
version 3.0 cannot access.
<P>
To enable Visual Basic version 3.0 applications to use Jet 2.0 databases,
Microsoft created the Microsoft Jet 2.0/Visual Basic 3.0 Compatibility
Layer (Compatibility Layer). Use of the Compatibility Layer is optional--
Microsoft Access version 2.0 reads and writes Jet 1.1, so Visual Basic/Jet
1.1 applications do not need to be converted even if users upgrade to
Microsoft Access version 2.0. There are some major benefits to upgrading,
though, and these are described below.
<P>
<P><h3>What the Compatibility Layer Includes</h3>
 
<P>
The complete Compatibility Layer consists of the following pieces:

<UL><LI>An updated version of the Visual Basic file that interfaces to Jet
   (VBDB300.DLL).

<LI>A new file (MSAJT112.DLL) that maps the VBDB300.DLL file and the
   Microsoft Jet 2.0 engine to each other.

<LI>A file that modifies the Visual Basic Crystal Report files to work
   with Jet 2.0.

<LI>Updated versions of the Jet-supported ISAM drivers (Paradox,
   FoxPro, and Btrieve).

<LI>A setup file that installs the layer and updates appropriate system
   files.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Microsoft Access 2.0 must be installed on the destination computer or
the Compatibility Layer won't install.
<P>
The setup file does not remove the Jet 1.1 files, but Visual Basic will be
using the Jet 2.0 files, once setup is run. Visual Basic-based applications
that use Jet 1.1 format databases will continue to operate because Jet 2.0
reads and writes Jet 1.1 format databases.
<P>
Visual Basic-based applications that create Jet 1.1 format databases can
continue to do so through the Jet 2.0 files by changing a setting.
<P>
<P><h3>Benefits of Upgrading to Jet 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access version 2.0, via Jet 2.0, provides a host of powerful new
features that will be available in Visual Basic-based applications once the
Compatibility Layer is installed:

<UL><LI>Cascading updates and deletes allow users to delete or update a
   record and have all dependent records reflect the change.

<LI>Table-level validation provides greatly increased data integrity
   and security.

<LI>Rushmore query optimization greatly speeds execution of many
   common queries.

<LI>Virtually any view can be updated.

<LI>Support for the Paradox 4.x file format.

<LI>Support for the Btrieve 6.x file format.

<LI>Improved SQL Pass-through for non-standard SQL that needs to be
   sent to servers to execute, for example, stored procedures.

<LI>Improved SQL support such as UNION, Subqueries, and the new Top N
   query.
<P>
</UL><h3>Limitations of Upgrading to Jet 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
The Compatibility Layer gives Visual Basic developers complete access to
Jet 2.0 and all its new features, but there are a few limitations. These
result primarily because the Visual Basic language has not changed and so
the Visual Basic developer does not gain programmatic access to some of the
new features. In many cases, Microsoft Access version 2.0 can be used to
access features that are not directly available through Visual Basic:

<UL><LI>Cascading updates and deletes are supported but must be specified
   using Microsoft Access version 2.0.

<LI>Table-level validation is supported but settings must be specified
   using Microsoft Access version 2.0.

<LI>Jet 2.0 now supports zero-length strings, so some updates may fail
   if validation rules require zero-length strings, which Visual Basic
   cannot use.

<LI>Jet 2.0 databases using any of the eight new language sort
   sequences will be read-only in Visual Basic.

<LI>Jet 1.0 format databases cannot be created by Jet 2.0 files.
<P>
</UL><h3>Distribution Issues</h3>
 
<P>
After obtaining the first Compatibility Layer, Microsoft allows propagation
of that layer free-of-charge to other eligible Visual Basic licensees
within the same organization. Applications created with Visual Basic and
the new Jet 2.0 database engine are, as before with Jet 1.1, fully
distributable royalty-free to application end users.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Obtain the Compatibility Layer</h3>
 
<P>
To obtain the Compatibility Layer, choose one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Software
</UL>Library:
<P>
<PRE> ~ <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/Comlyr.exe">Comlyr.exe</A> <I>(size: 741798 bytes)</I> 

</PRE>For more information about downloading files from the Microsoft Software
Library, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q119591.htm">Q119591</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from
               Online Services

</PRE><LI>If you are unable to access the source(s) listed above, you can have
   COMLYR.EXE mailed or faxed to you by calling Microsoft Technical Support
   Monday through Friday, 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Pacific time at
   (425) 646-5105. If you are outside the United States, contact the
   Microsoft subsidiary for your area. To locate your subsidiary, go to the
   Microsoft Web site <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm</A></B>

<LI>Purchase the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT) version
   2.0 available through resellers or direct from Microsoft. The
   price is $495 for new users. However, until August 31, 1994, current
   Microsoft Access Distribution Kit version 1.1 and Visual Basic
   version 3.0 licensees will receive $100 off price via a rebate.
   All the files you need are included.

<LI>Purchase the Microsoft Office Developer's Kit (ODK) and Microsoft
   Access version 2.0. Both products are available through resellers or
   direct from Microsoft. The suggested retail price for the ODK is $99.95.
   If you own Visual Basic version 3.0 Professional Edition, you can get
   the ODK direct from Microsoft for $49.95.
<P>
   The ODK will also be available as a standard component in all new
   packages of Visual Basic version 3.0 Professional Edition. The ODK
   comes on CD-ROM only.
<P>
   The ODK includes all files in the Compatibility Layer except the main
   Microsoft Access version 2.0 database engine file, which is available
   in Microsoft Access version 2.0. Therefore to use the ODK edition of
   the Compatibility Layer, you need to purchase Microsoft Access version
   2.0. The license in the ODK permits distribution of this file with
   Visual Basic version 3.0-based applications. Suggested retail price
   for Microsoft Access version 2.0 is $495. Until August 31, 1994, current
   Microsoft Access version 1.x users can upgrade for $99. And those users
   upgrading from competing products and from Microsoft Office can purchase
   Microsoft Access version 2.0 for $129.
