The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation, Learning, Professional, and
   Enterprise Editions for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a Visual Basic project uses a custom control (.OCX) whose CLSID has
changed since the project was last opened, the following message will be
displayed when opening the project:
<P>
<PRE>   '&lt;Path To OCX&gt;' could not be loaded-Continue Loading Project?

</PRE>After choosing "Yes," a second message will occur two times:
<P>
<PRE>   "Errors during load. Refer to &lt;Path To LOG File&gt; for details"

</PRE>Once the project is opened, all occurrences of the custom control have been
replaced with PictureBox controls.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When Visual Basic attempts to load a custom control, each control is
verified by its CLSID. If the CLSID stored with the project differs from
the CLSID of the custom control, Visual Basic cannot load the control. In
an attempt to maintain as many properties as possible, Visual Basic
replaces the missing control with a PictureBox control. The code associated
with the missing control is retained.
<P>
A CLSID of a custom control changes when any of the following conditions
are true:

<UL><LI>The custom control project's Version Compatibility setting is set to
   "No Compatibility." When no compatibility is set, a new CLSID is
   generated for a custom control every time it is compiled.

<LI>The custom control project's Version Compatibility setting is set to
   "Project Compatibility" or "Binary Compatibility," and the control's
   interface has been modified in such a way that compatibility could not
   be maintained. This will primarily occur if a Property or Method
   definition has changed.

<LI>A control is overwritten and the newer version has a different CLSID.
<P>
</UL>For more information about project compatibility, refer to the REFERENCES
section below.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>   WARNING: ANY USE BY YOU OF THE FOLLOWING STEPS PROVIDED IN THIS
   ARTICLE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides these steps "as is"
   without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including
   but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or
   fitness for a particular purpose.

</PRE>The CLSID of each custom control is saved in the project file (.VBP). The
VBP file may be opened with Notepad or any text editor. If you know the new
CLSID for the new version of the custom control, the VBP file can be
modified to reflect this change in CLSIDs.
<P>
NOTE: Version compatibility in custom controls is used to ensure that your
new version of a custom control will not break backward compatibility with
applications that may be using older versions of your custom control.
Following the example below to modify the project file with the new CLSID
could result in unexpected errors in your application.
<P>
For example, if your custom control, named Custom.OCX, appears in your
project, a line in the VBP file could read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Object={B0784T02-A67Y-11E0-8840-00DD00F7B36C}#1.0#0; Custom.Ocx

</PRE>You can modify the CLSID in the above line,
<P>
<PRE>   {B0784T02-A67Y-11E0-8840-00DD00F7B36C}

</PRE>with the new CLSID of the Custom.Ocx. Saving the VBP file and reopening the
project with Visual Basic should solve the problem.
<P>
To obtain the new CLSID of your custom control, you may need to search the
system registry or use a tool such as OLE2VIEW.EXE that can provide such
information. The utility, OLE2VIEW.EXE, can be downloaded from the
Microsoft Internet site at <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com.</A></B> To find the download
file, search for "OLE2VIEW."
