The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Professional and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic,
   16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
With the DBList's IntegralHeight property set to True (the default)
switching back and forth between the 3D and flat versions of the DBList
control (via the Appearance property) causes the DBList control to shrink
vertically, possibly all the way to a single horizontal line.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the control's Appearance property is Flat, the control has a certain
number of pixels X for a certain number of rows N, as well as two extra
pixels for the border. When switched to a 3D view, the control still only
uses a maximum of X+2 pixels total but now uses 4 pixels for the border,
and it doesn't have enough space left over for all N rows of data. To
remedy this, the control reduces the number of rows shown by one. Repeating
this numerous times causes row after row to be lost, until no rows are
left, and the control appears as a flat line.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
After setting the Appearance property to the desired value, resize the
control to the desired proportions.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic, or if it is already running, choose New Project
   from the File menu.

<P><LI>Click and drag a single DBList control onto the form.  The
   IntegralHeight property of the control is set to True by default.

<P><LI>Repeatedly double-click on the DBList's Appearance property in the
   Properties window to toggle between the flat and 3D views of the DBList
   control. The control will shrink in size vertically, until it remains as
   just a single line on the form.
