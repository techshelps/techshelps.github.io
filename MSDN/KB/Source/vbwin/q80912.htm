The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows, version 2.0
- Microsoft Professional Toolkit for Microsoft Visual Basic programming
<PRE>  system for Windows, version 1.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual Basic Graph custom control cannot successfully print
directly to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) II series LaserJet. This is a
compatibility issue between the Graph custom control and the HP II
series only. It is not a problem with Visual Basic.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem, add an additional form to the project,
transfer the graph's image to the form, and then print the form. This
method bypasses the DrawMode=5 (print) method and the incompatibility
issue. The example in the More Information section demonstrates how
how to implement this workaround.
<P>
Note: Unless you know that your graph will never be printed on an HP
II Series LaserJet, you may wish to always use this print method.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Graph custom control
supplied with the products listed above. This bug was corrected in
Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual Basic Graph custom control version 1.2 allows you to send a
graph image directly to your printer by setting the graph's DrawMode
property to 5 (print). However, the Graph control is incompatible with
the HP II LaserJet family. When using the DrawMode=5 (print) method to
print to an HP II LaserJet, only a portion of the graph will print.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 
1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Add File, and select the GRAPH.VBX
   custom control file. The Graph tool will appear in the Toolbox.

<P><LI>Add another form (Form2).

<P><LI>Change the following properties for Form2:
<P>
<PRE>   Property     Value
   ------------------

   ControlBox   False
   MaxButton    False
   MinButton    False
   Caption      False

</PRE><P><LI>On Form1, create a Graph control (Graph1) and a command button
   (Command1). Set the Caption property for Command1 to "Print."

<P><LI>Size and edit Graph1 so that it appears the way you want it to print.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Command1_Click event:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Command1_Click ()

      'change to black/white for clearer printing
      Graph1.DrawStyle = 0
      'update change to black/white
      Graph1.DrawMode = 2

      Load Form2
      'size Form2 and transfer Graph1's image
      Form2.width = Graph1.width
      Form2.height = Graph1.height
      Form2.picture = Graph1.picture
      Form2.visible = 1   'optional

      Form2.PrintForm

      'return Graph1 to display in color (optional)
      Graph1.DrawStyle = 1
      'update display to color
      Graph1.DrawMode = 2

   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>From the Run menu, choose Start (ALT R, S) and click the Print button.
<P>
</OL>Unless you specify otherwise, Graph1 will originally be displayed in color.
Once the Command1_Click event is triggered, the graph will convert to
black and white. If you exclude the optional line Form2.visible=1, a
dialog box will appear stating that Form2 is being printed. Graph1 will
convert back to a color display, and the program will end.
<P>
If you included the optional line Form2.visible=1, you will see Form2
appear and resize with the black and white graph image as its picture.
A dialog box will appear stating that Form2 is being printed. Graph1
will convert back to a color display and the program will end.
<P>
