The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation, Learning, Professional, and
   Enterprise Editions for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
DCOMCNFG.EXE (DCOM Config) is a utility you can use to secure DCOM Objects
you have created. This article describes the DCOM Config interfaces,
options, and settings.
<P>
Because security is much more limited on Windows 95, the interface and
options may differ on Windows 95 systems. This article is written for those
running DCOM Config on Windows NT systems.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The main interface of DCOM Config is divided into three tabs:

<OL><P><LI>Applications.

<P><LI>Default Properties.

<P><LI>Default Security.
<P>
</OL><h3>Applications Tab</h3>
 
<P>
The Applications tab shows each of the items registered under the following
registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AppId\

</PRE></OL>Beneath this key are all of the objects that can be launched on a remote
machine. DCOM Config displays just the ProgIDs (friendly names) of each
object, such as "Microsoft Word Document" or "Microsoft Access Database."
Some objects may register without registering a ProgID; in these cases, the
GUID of the object will be displayed, such as "{4E6B942A-01B0-11D1-A9CB-
00AA00B7B36F}."
<P>
For each item listed in the Applications tab, properties for each
application can be viewed by selecting an item and choosing the
"Properties" button or by double-clicking an application name.
<P>
<P><h3>Default Properties Tab</h3>
 
<P>
Each of the values displayed under the Default Properties tab may be found
under the following key in the registry:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\OLE

</PRE>The first item in the Default Properties tab is a check box:
<P>
<PRE>   "Enable Distributed COM on this computer"

</PRE>This is a global setting for the entire machine. When this option is
checked, the machine allows the creation of DCOM objects. If it is not
checked, objects cannot be created via DCOM.
<P>
NOTE: You must reboot the system in order for a change in this setting to
take effect.
<P>
The second part of the Default Properties tab is the Default Distributed
COM Communication Properties, which has of two levels:

<OL><P><LI>Default Authentication Level.

<P><LI>Default Impersonation Level.
<P>
</OL>These two options can only be modified if DCOM is enabled on this system.
<P>
<P><h3>Default Authentication Level (Packet Level)</h3>
 
<P>
Authentication Levels are as follows;
<P>
<PRE>Name                         Description
</PRE></OL> 
<PRE>None                         No authentication.
Connect                      Authentication occurs when a connection
                             is made to the server. Connectionless
                             protocols do not use this.
Call                         The authentication occurs when a RPC call
                             is accepted by the server. Connectionless
                             protocols do not use this.
Packet                       Authenticates the data on a per-packet
                             basis. All data is authenticated.
Packet Integrity             This authenticates that the data has come
                             from the client, and checks that the
                             data has not been modified.
Packet Privacy               In addition to the checks made by the other
                             authentication techniques, this encrypts
                             the packet.
Default                      May vary depending upon operating system.

</PRE>Note that "Connect" and "Call" are used for connectionless protocols only.
Windows NT uses a connectionless protocol, UDP, by default. However,
Windows 95 uses TCP, which is connection-based. Windows 95 machines can
only accept calls on the "None" or "Connect" levels.
<P>
<P><h3>Default Impersonation Level</h3>
 
<P>
If no security is set at the object level, the server uses the security
setting specified here as the default. The possible values are:
<P>
<PRE>Name                         Description
</PRE> 
<PRE>Anonymous                    The client is anonymous. This setting is
                             not currently supported by DCOM.
Identify                     The server can impersonate the client to
                             check permissions in the ACL (Access Control
                             List) but cannot access system objects.
Impersonate                  The server can impersonate the client and
                             access system objects on the client's behalf.
Delegate                     In addition to the Impersonate level, this
                             level can impersonate the client on calls to
                             other servers. This is not supported in the
                             current release of DCOM.

</PRE>The last item on the Default Security tab is a check box:
<P>
<PRE>   "Provide additional security for reference tracking"

</PRE>which tells the server to track connected client applications by keeping an
additional reference count. Checking this box uses more memory and may
cause COM to slow down, but it ensures that a client application cannot
kill a server process by artificially forcing a reference count to zero.
<P>
<P><h3>Default Security Tab</h3>
 
<P>
There are three options under the Default Security tab. Each of the values
stored here can be found in the Windows registry at the following location:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\OLE

</PRE>The three options are:

<OL><P><LI>Default Access Permission: This value determines the users and groups
   that can access an object when no other access permissions are provided.
   For information on how to give individual access permissions to specific
   DCOM objects, see the "Application Properties" section later in this
   document. By default, access is provided to the "System" and
   "Interactive" groups.

<P><LI>Default Launch Permission: This value determines the users and groups
   that can launch an object when no other access permissions are provided.
   For more information on how to give individual launch permissions to
   specific DCOM objects, see the section "Application Properties" later in
   this document.

<P><LI>Default Configuration Permission: This value determines the users and
   groups that may read or modify configuration information for DCOM
   applications. This also includes which users and groups will have
   permission to install new DCOM servers.
<P>
</OL><h3>System Groups</h3>
 
<P>
There are several group accounts you will find when you configure users and
groups. The following list is a summary of which user belongs to each
group:
<P>
<PRE>Group                     Description
</PRE></OL> 
<PRE>Interactive               Includes all users who log on to a Windows NT
                          system locally (at the console). It does not
                          include users who connect to NT resources across
                          a network or are started as a server.

Network                   Includes all users who connect to Windows NT
                          resources across a network. It does not include
                          those who connect through an interactive logon.

Creator/Owner             The Creator/Owner group is created for each
                          sharable resource in the Windows NT system. Its
                          membership is the set of users who either create
                          resource s(such as a file) and those who take
                          ownership of them.

Everyone                  All users accessing the system, whether locally,
                          remotely, or across the network.

System                    The local operating system.

</PRE>The list above includes the group accounts that are intrinsic to Windows NT
systems. Your particular network may include more groups from which you may
choose. In order to determine the membership of each custom group account,
you must contact your network administrator.
<P>
<P><h3>Application Properties</h3>
 
<P>
You can specify custom settings for individual DCOM applications by
choosing the Properties button on the "Applications" tab in DCOM Config.
The following section describes each tab (General, Location, Security,
Identity) and setting found within Application Properties.
<P>
<P><h3>General</h3>
 
<P>
The General tab provides general information about the application,
displaying the Application name, type (local server or remote server), and
location (local path or remote computer). These settings are not modifiable
through the DCOM Config interface.
<P>
The General Table retrieves all of its information from subkeys of the
following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{...CLSID...}

</PRE>where {...CLSID...} is the unique CLSID for the Object Server currently
being viewed.
<P>
<P><h3>Location</h3>
 
<P>
This tab is used to determine where DCOM will execute the application.
There are three possible choices:

<OL><P><LI>Run application on the computer where the data is located: if selected,
   DCOM will execute the application where the data is located. This is
   useful only if the application provides a data file for the server
   application.

<P><LI>Run application on this computer: indicates that the DCOM application
   should run on the local machine.

<P><LI>Run application on the following computer: allows you to specify a
   computer on which to execute. (This feature is currently unavailable on
   Windows NT 4.0 systems, Windows NT 4.0 does not support full security
   delegation.)
<P>
</OL>If more than one of the above is selected, DCOM will use the first
applicable option. Client applications may also override this setting.
<P>
<P><h3>Security</h3>
 
<P>
On the Security tab, you can customize settings for the following
individual application permissions:

<OL><P><LI>Access Permissions.

<P><LI>Launch Permissions.

<P><LI>Configuration Permissions.
<P>
</OL>If you do not customize these settings, the default security settings are
used. For more information about the Security tab, see the section earlier
in this article on "Default Security."
<P>
<P><h3>Identity</h3>
 
<P>
This tab is used to determine which account you want to use to run the
application. There are four choices by which the system determines which
account your DCOM object will run under:

<OL><P><LI>The Interactive User: the application will run using the security
   context of the user currently logged onto the computer. If this option
   is selected and the user is not logged on, then the application will not
   start.

<P><LI>The Launching User: the application will run using the security context
   of the user who started the application. The launching user and the
   interactive user may be the same.

<P><LI>This User: you may specify the user whose security context will be used
   to run the application.

<P><LI>The System Account: this is available only for NT services that use
   DCOM.
