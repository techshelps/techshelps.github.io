The information in this article applies to:

   Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The 3-D Group Push Button (THREED.VBX) custom control will not
automatically size itself to the bitmap assigned to the PictureDown
property. When the AutoSize property is set to "2 - Adjust Button Size
to Picture," the 3-D Group Push Button custom control will
automatically size itself to the bitmap assigned to the PictureUp
property. This behavior is by design.
<P>
This information applies to Microsoft Professional Toolkit for
Microsoft Visual Basic programming system version 1.0 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual Basic 3-D Group Push Button custom control can have a
bitmap assigned to the button when it is in the down position, and
another bitmap when the button is in the up position (the PictureUp
and PictureDown properties are set to different .BMP files at design
time). However, the 3-D Group Push Button control will not
automatically size itself to the size of the picture assigned to the
PictureDown property even if the AutoSize property is set to "2 -
Adjust Button Size to Picture."
<P>
When the AutoSize property is set to "2 - Adjust Button Size to
Picture," the 3-D Group Push Button custom control will automatically
size itself to the bitmap assigned to the PictureUp property. This
means that the button will size itself to the picture it is supposed
to display only when it is in the up position. If there is a bitmap
assigned to the PictureDown property and this picture is bigger than
the 3-D Group Push Button control, this picture will appear clipped
when the button is pressed.
<P>
The following steps demonstrate how the 3-D Group Push Button custom
control does not size itself to the bitmap assigned to the PictureDown
property even when the AutoSize property for the control is set to
"2 - Adjust Button Size to Picture."
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Run Visual Basic, or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT,
   F, N) if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by
   default.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Add File. In the Files box, select the
   THREED.VBX custom control file.

<P><LI>Click the Toolbox to select the 3-D Group Push Button control.

<P><LI>Click and drag on the form to place a 3-D Group Push Button
   control.

<P><LI>Change the AutoSize property in the Properties Bar to
   "2 - Adjust Button Size to Picture" (this is the default setting).

<P><LI>Change the PictureDown property in the Properties Bar by choosing a
   bitmap file from the Properties list box. Note that "(none)" is
   first displayed, because no picture is assigned by default. You can
   click the button with three dots on the right of the Properties
   list box to choose a bitmap file.

<P><LI>From the Run menu, choose Start to run the application.

<P><LI>Click the 3-D Group Push Button to push it into the down position.
<P>
</OL>The picture that is assigned to the PictureDown property is displayed.
If the picture happens to be larger than the 3-D Group Push Button
control, the picture will appear clipped. If the picture chosen was
smaller, the background of the 3-D Group Push Button control will
show. In either case, the 3-D Group Push Button control did not resize
itself to the picture once the button was pressed.
<P>
If you assign a picture to the PictureUp property of the 3-D Group
Push Button control, the button will automatically size itself to this
picture. Nonetheless, the 3-D Group Push Button control will not size
itself to the picture assigned to the PictureDown property once the
button is pressed.
