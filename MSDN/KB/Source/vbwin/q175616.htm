Error 438 occurs when running a program in which a form is assigned to a

   Object doesn't support this property or method

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible workarounds for this problem.

<UL><LI>Access the form directly rather than by a variable containing the form.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Create property procedures in the form's code to provide access to the
   properties of the controls on the form.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
