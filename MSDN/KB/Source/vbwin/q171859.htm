The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Professional and Enterprise Editions, 16-bit
   only, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When trying to connect to an ODBC datasource from a datacontrol or the Data
Access Objects (DAO), the mouse disappears, the machine hangs, or the
machine General Protection Faults (GPF).
<P>
Attempting to connect to an ODBC datasource from Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit,
causes the machine to behave as described above. It only occurs when a
driver attempts to display a sign-on banner or a login dialog. For most
drivers, a dialog is not displayed if a full connect string is provided,
avoiding the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem is due to the driver not correctly handling the window handle
(HWND) that is passed to it on the SQLDriverConnect ODBC API call. The HWND
parameter of this ODBC function call is defined in the ODBC 2.0
Programmer's Reference and SDK Guide as:
<P>
"Input. Window handle. The application can pass the handle of the parent
window, if applicable, or a null pointer if either the window handle is not
applicable or if SQLDriverConnect will not present any dialog boxes."
<P>
Because many ODBC driver vendors implemented their drivers such that a NULL
HWND would never show dialogs, Visual Basic was forced to pass in a valid
window handle. Because there is not always a window associated with a
Visual Basic application, Visual Basic passes in the Desktop window handle.
This causes a problem for many drivers. Many drivers simply take the HWND
parameter passed in and use it in the calls to show their dialogs. The
problem is that the dialog functions are documented such that NULL should
be used when the Desktop window is to be used as the parent. Passing the
Desktop window as the parent in the dialog calls can and does have adverse
effects that are causing the problems listed above.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Upgrade to version 2.10.2401 of the ODBC Driver Manager (ships with Visual
Basic 4.0 Professional and Enterprise) and have the ODBC driver vendor
modify the driver such that it checks for the Desktop window and uses NULL
for the parent window in the calls to the dialog functions. The SQL Server
driver versions 2.10.2401 and greater does this correctly. The logic in the
driver should be something like:
<P>
<PRE>   RETCODE SQLDriverConnect(HDBC hdbc, HWND hwnd, UCHAR FAR * szConnStrIn,
</PRE>SWORD cbConnStrIn, UCHAR FAR * szConnStrOut, SWORD cbConnStrOutMax,
SWORD FAR * pcbConnStrOut, UWORD fDriverCompletion)
<PRE>   {
     //...... otherlogic
   if (GetDeskTopWindow() == hwnd){hwnd = NULL;}
    //rest of logic (to show dialogs)
   }

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is an ODBC driver implementation problem. Contact the driver vendor
for an updated driver. If the driver vendor does not have an updated
driver, provide them with the information in the RESOLUTION section of this
article.
<P>
NOTE: This problem does affect early ODBC Driver Manager (ODBC.DLL) and SQL
Server driver versions. The problem was fixed in the 2.10.2401 versions of
these components.
