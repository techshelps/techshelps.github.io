The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 3.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The MSCOMM.VBX custom control may appear to send an unexpected byte
when the port is closed by setting the PortOpen property to false.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is a known problem with the miniport driver SERIAL.386 that was
released with Windows for Workgroups 3.11. This is not a problem with
the MSCOMM control since it can be reproduced by calling the CloseComm
Windows API function directly.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from
               Online Services

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Connect two machines using a null modem cable. You must run Windows
   for Workgroups 3.11 on the machine running Visual Basic.

<P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic, Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add an MSCOMM (Comm1) control and a command button (Command1) to Form1.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Command1 Click event procedure:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Command1_Click ()
      comm1.PortOpen = True
      comm1.PortOpen = False
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Start the Terminal application on the second machine. In Terminal
   choose  Settings Communications (ALT, S, C) and change the Baud Rate
   to 9600.

<P><LI>From the Run menu in Visual Basic on the first machine, choose Start
   (ALT, R, S) or press the F5 key to run the program. Click the
   Command1 button and the machine running Terminal will indicate that a
   byte has been transmitted from closing the port.
<P>
</OL>The problem can also be reproduced with the following method:

<OL><P><LI>Connect two machines using a null modem cable. You must run Windows
   for Workgroups 3.11 on the machine running Visual Basic.

<P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a command button (Command1) to Form1.

<P><LI>Add the following Declare statements to the General declarations
   section of Form1:
<P>
<PRE>   ' Enter each of the following Declare statements on one, single line:
   Declare Function OpenComm Lib "User" (ByVal lpComName As String, ByVal
      wInQueue As Integer, ByVal wOutQueue As Integer) As Integer
   Declare Function CloseComm Lib "User" (ByVal nCid As Integer)
      As Integer

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the Command1 Click event procedure:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Command1_Click ()
      Dim id As Integer, success As Integer
      id = OpenComm("COM1", 1024, 128)
      success = CloseComm(id)
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Start the Terminal application on the second machine. In Terminal,
   choose Settings Communications (Alt, S, C) and change the Baud Rate
   to 9600.

<P><LI>From the Run menu in Visual Basic on the first machine, choose Start
   (ALT, R, S) or press the F5 key to run the program. Click the
   Command1 button and the machine running Terminal will indicate that a
   byte has been transmitted from closing the port.
