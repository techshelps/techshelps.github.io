The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- The Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, version 2.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Painting problems can occur if you have a large project with many forms,
or you have a small project and are low on system resources at the time the
small project is loaded.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These painting problems occur in the Visual Basic programming environment.
They usually occur after the environment displays an "Out of Memory" error.
This error may mean that your system is very low on system resources and
the Visual Basic for Windows programming environment is unable to use any
additional system resources to paint the next form or control.
<P>
An "Out of Memory" error can occur while coding in the design mode if you
place too much code or text into a module or form; there is a limit of 64K
of code for each form and module. Or it can occur if you try to add another
form or control to a project and are too low on system resources to perform
the operation.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
It is a good idea to stop adding forms, controls, or code once you get this
error while the environment is in design mode. You need to close some of
your other Windows applications or reduce the number of forms or controls
that take up resources. A way to obtain the amount of available resources
is to check the About Program Manager... dialog box in the Help menu of the
Program Manager. This dialog box displays a percentage of the system
resources; if the percentage is getting below 10% or so, you are getting
close to receiving an "Out of Memory" error in the Visual Basic for Windows
programming environment.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Standard and
Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows, version 2.0.
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0 for
Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start VB.EXE.

<P><LI>Press the far left button on the Title Bar that contains a picture
   resembling a form icon and Form2 should display.

<P><LI>Repeat step 2 until you get an "Out of Memory" error. Note that the
   number of forms that can be displayed before getting this error depends
   on the amount of free system resources that you started with.

<P><LI>Once you get this error, try to bring up the Menu Design Windows, by
   selecting the Window menu. Or try to move the Toolbox, Title Bar or
   other Windows that are part of the Visual Basic for Windows programming
   environment. Moving any of these tools may result in a painting problem.

<P><LI>Visual Basic for Windows tries to continue working even after the "Out
   of Memory" error occurs which ends up causing the painting problem.
   The painting problem occurs because Windows has no resources to give to
   the Visual Basic for Windows programming environment to perform a
   repaint of the screen.
