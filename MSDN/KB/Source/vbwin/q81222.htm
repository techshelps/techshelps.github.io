The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE>- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 1.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows allows you to share forms between
projects. When you make a change to a shared form in one project, that
change will be automatically updated in the other projects that share
the form.
<P>
A workaround is also available if you want to change a shared form but
do not want to update the form in other projects.
<P>
Further below is an example of how to use this shared form feature in
Visual Basic for Windows, and an example of how to change a shared form
without updating it in shared projects.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Below are two examples: the first shows how to update shared forms,
and the second demonstrates how to change a shared form without having
those changes affect the same form in other projects.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 1</h3>
 
1. Run Visual Basic for Windows, or from the File menu, choose New
<PRE>   Project (press ALT, F, N) if Visual Basic for Windows is already
   running. Form1 is created by default.

</PRE><P><LI>Add a couple text boxes and command buttons to Form1 by
   double-clicking the appropriate tools in the toolbox and placing
   the controls at certain locations on the form. From the Properties
   Bar, change the FormName property of Form1 to Test1.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save Project As. Save Test1 as TEST1.FRM
   and save the project as TEST1.MAK.

<P><LI>Start a new project by choosing New Project from the File menu.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Add File, and select TEST1.FRM.

<P><LI>Once TEST1.FRM is loaded into the project, delete the command
   buttons, and replace them with picture boxes.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save Project As. Save the project as
   TEST2.MAK, and save TEST1.FRM with the same name.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open Project. In the Files box, select
   TEST1.MAK.
<P>
</OL>Notice that the form has been updated to include picture boxes and the
command buttons were deleted.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 2</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps are very similar to the example above but with a change
in step 5.
<P>
This example demonstrates how to share forms between projects, but
with the forms being designed differently.

<OL><P><LI>Run Visual Basic for Windows, or from the File menu, choose New
   Project (press ALT, F, N) if Visual Basic for Windows is already
   running. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a couple text boxes and command buttons to Form1 by
   double-clicking the appropriate tools in the toolbox and placing
   the controls at certain locations on the form. From the Properties
   Bar, change the FormName property of Form1 to Test3.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save Project As. Save Test3 as TEST3.FRM
   and save the project as TEST3.MAK.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose New Project.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Add File. In the Files box, select
   TEST3.FRM. Once the file is loaded, delete the command buttons
   and replace them with picture boxes.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save File As, and save the form as
   TEST4.FRM.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save Project As, and save the project as
   TEST4.MAK.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open Project. In the Files box, select
   TEST3.MAK.
<P>
</OL>Notice that the form's controls have NOT been updated with picture
boxes.
