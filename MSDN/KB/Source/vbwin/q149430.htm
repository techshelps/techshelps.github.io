The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic,
   16-bit only, for Windows, version 4.0
<LI>Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A Visual Basic program may not run under Windows 95 because a 16-bit DLL
that has been listed in the registry as a Known16dll has been moved from
the Windows\System directory.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Registry has a Known16dll key entry for a DLL that has previously been
loaded. If there is an entry in this key for a specific DLL then Windows
will look for the DLL file in the Windows\System directory first and then
follow the normal DLL search path. If this DLL has been moved to another
location, the key entry will still be in the registry. This could cause the
wrong version of a DLL to be used.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use RegEdit to find and delete the Known16dll entry for this DLL. Windows
95 will now search for the DLL in the normal way. Once Windows 95 finds
loads the DLL, a new Known16dll key entry is made in the registry.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The registry key Known16dlls is located in the following section of the
registry:
<P>
<PRE>   \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
        System
           CurrentControlSet
              Control
                 SessionManager

</PRE>If there is an entry in the Known16dll key for a DLL that a Visual Basic
program requires , Windows 95 will first look in the Windows\System
directory, AND then follow the normal search path below.
<P>
<P><h3>Under Win16</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>The current directory.

<P><LI>The Windows directory.

<P><LI>The Windows system directory.

<P><LI>The directory containing the executable file for the current task.

<P><LI>The directories listed in the PATH environment variable.

<P><LI>The list of directories mapped in a network
<P>
</OL>If the DLL is moved from the Windows\System directory to a new location,
the Known16dll key is not deleted; because of this, Windows will continue
to look for the DLL in the Windows\System directory first.
<P>
