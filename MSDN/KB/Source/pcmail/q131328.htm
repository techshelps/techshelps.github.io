The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows on a computer that
is running Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, you may see some
variation on the following errors:
<P>
<PRE>   unexpected memory or network error

   call to undefined dynalink

   user has not logged into the net

   general protection fault

</PRE>Other errors may be the result of having files from Windows for Workgroups
(WFW) Mail and 3.2x of Mail for Windows installed on the same workstation.
The files between these two clients are not interchangeable and provide
different features.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to resolve the previously mentioned error messages, the
following issues should be addressed regarding the mixing of the different
file versions.
<P>
Updates made to the Mail 3.2x files are not made to the corresponding WFW
files. For example, an update to MSSFS.DLL for 3.2x corrected a problem
that caused the Global Address List (GAL) to remain locked, resulting in a
failed Rebuild. Currently, there is no way to correct this problem with WFW
Mail.
<P>
If you installed the corrected 3.2x file into WFW, it will corrupt the At
Work FAX, remove the ability of WFW Mail to remember the user's password,
and cause the errors listed above. Under no circumstances should WFW files
be replaced with any of Mail 3.2x files. The only way you can use the
updated Mail 3.2x files is to completely uninstalled WFW Mail and replace
it with a complete installation of the 3.2x client.
<P>
Due to a version conflict, many of the WFW files will not be replaced when
the 3.2 or 3.2a client is installed. Many of the files are installed, even
if you choose not to install Mail when you installed WFW. As a result, you
may have the above problems with mixed versions of the files. When any of
the above errors occur, as a first troubleshooting step, you should check
the WFW files.
<P>
Recently, a SETUP.INF file has been released that is designed to allow the
3.2a client to install over the WFW client. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q124953.htm">Q124953</A></B>
   TITLE     : SETUP.INF for Windows for Workgroups 3.11

</PRE>While this SETUP.INF file generally works, the following problems still
remain:

<OL><P><LI>MSMAIL.HLP will not be upgraded to the 3.2a version.

<P><LI>The Postoffice Manager menu option will not be removed from the machine
   on which it is installed.

<P><LI>WGPOMGR.DLL, CMC.DLL, and 26 At Work FAX files will be "orphaned" on
   the your hard drive.

<P><LI>FAXVIEW.EXE, IMPEXP.DLL, SCHEDMSG.DLL, FAXVIEW.HLP, and SENDFILE.DLL
   will not be updated to the 3.2x version.
<P>
   NOTE: These files do not contain the version number problem, so they
   can be overwritten by a fix, if one should become available.

<P><LI>MSSFS.DLL, MSMAIL.EXE, CONVERT.EXE, VFORMS.DLL, AB.DLL, MAILMGR.DLL,
   MAILSPL.EXE, MAPI.DLL, PABNSP.DLL, and STORE.DLL will be updated to
   the 3.2a version, but they will have an incorrect date. The files will
   be dated as 7/22/94; they should be dated 8/17/94.

<P><LI>If the customer does not follow the instructions in the article closely
   and turn off At Work FAX prior to running the 3.2a setup, there will
   be stranded lines in the MSMAIL.INI that may cause errors to occur.
<P>
</OL>This issue is generally referred to as "mixed DLLs". Below is a list of the
DLLs and EXE that can be a WFW version or a Mail 3.2x version:
<P>
<PRE>   MSMAIL.EXE
   MSSFS.DLL
   FRAMEWRK.DLL
   STORE.DLL
   VFORMS.DLL
   DEMILAYR.DLL
   MAILMGR.DLL
