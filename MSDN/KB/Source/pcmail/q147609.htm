<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
As of April 1995, the MCI Mail Gateway is no longer supported by Microsoft.
The product was removed from the product list in April 1994, and
Microsoft's general rule is to offer support for one year after a product
is dropped.
<P>
The following is a more detailed explanation of this MCI Mail Gateway
issue.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
ANNOUNCEMENT:
<P>
CMS (Computer Mail Services) to Develop and Sell a New MCI Mail Gateway
<P>
Microsoft agrees with Computer Mail Services (CMS) to develop and sell a
new MCI Mail Gateway for Microsoft Mail. This information was released to
the public on February 16th 1994.
<P>
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING
<P>
Microsoft's customers have been requesting an improved solution for
connecting their Microsoft Mail installation to MCI Mail. The current MCI
Mail Gateway for PC Mail was based on the MCI Mail network of 5 years ago.
During this time the MCI Mail network has gone through various changes.
<P>
In order to better serve Microsoft customers, Microsoft concluded it would
be best to work with an experienced developer of MCI Mail Connectivity
software. The result of this decision is a new third-party gateway for MCI
Mail connectivity developed, sold and supported by Computer Mail Services
in Southfield, Michigan. This gateway will also be sold by MCI and MCI's
worldwide distribution network.
<P>
WHAT DO CUSTOMERS NEED TO DO
<P>
Current users of the MCI Mail Gateway for PC Mail, should contact Computer
Mail Services and request the special upgrade promotion.  New or potential
customers also need to contact CMS for product information.
<P>
What are the new features?
<P>
CMS has addressed many of the major concerns of our customers. In addition,
<PRE>they have added functionality where possible.   Please contact CMS for more
</PRE>details on the current feature set.
<P>
How does my administration interface change?
<P>
The new gateway will supplement Microsoft Mail's administration program
with a new utility, specifically dealing with the gateway.  Items such as
communications settings, MCI Mail account information, scheduling, access
permissions, post office/user limits will be maintained using the new
MBADMIN program. Set up of administrator-defined MCI Mail address and
associating with the post office will still be performed using the MS Mail
ADMIN program.
<P>
Do my end users have to do anything different?
<P>
End users use the same address templates as before.  In fact, if the
administrator has set up the MCI Mail address information, they will
experience no changes whatsoever.  Access to new features, such as the
pseudo-addresses for special MCI Mail handling options, will require new
steps.  The administrator can assist users to acquaint them of the new
capabilities.
<P>
