<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
MAPIResolveName is used to resolve the names found in the Address Books
associated with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. MAPIResolveName uses the
same searching routine as Microsoft Mail for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MAPIResolveName will first search the address list that is selected as the
default address book. If no matches are found, it will search the Global
Address List (GAL). If available, the Personal Address Book (PAB) is
searched next.
<P>
The GAL will be the second address list searched, when not selected as the
default address list. However, once one or more matches are found with the
current address list, MAPIResolveName stops searching. MAPIResolveName will
not continue to parse an additional address list.
<P>
MAPIResolveName searches only the friendly names associated with a given
mail account. It uses a space character found in the friendly names as a
delimiter. This allows both first names and last names to be returned. This
type of search procedure that includes indexing can optimize searching
large objects, such as GALs that can have several thousand separate
addresses.
<P>
For example,
<P>
If you search on the text string "Car," the following names are found in
the address list selected as the default address list:
<P>
<PRE>   Carrol, Hendrikson
   Michael, Carter
   The fast car ran off the road

</PRE>All three addresses will be returned. However, a second or third address
list will not be searched.
<P>
