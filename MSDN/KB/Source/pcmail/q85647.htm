The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a Mail administrator tries to delete a user from the Postoffice
Address List (POL) using the Mail Administrator (ADMIN.EXE) program
provided with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, the following error message
may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Notice 56
   Error deleting user address in Postoffice Address list.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if the POL has a missing or corrupted record for the
user (for example, if the UserID is missing from the POL). The cause of the
problem can be one of the following:

<OL><P><LI>The user is a local user, and the record is missing from the ADMIN.NME
   file; however, the access (ACCESS.*) files contain information about
   this user.

<P><LI>The user record is present in the POL but is corrupted.

<P><LI>The user is an external postoffice user added to the POL. The user
   record is present in the POL; however, the record is corrupted.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The POL information is contained in the ADMINSHD.NME and ADMIN.NME files.
These two files should always have the same exact size, date, and relative
time.
<P>
The following are corresponding workarounds for the above causes. These
steps are geared for the Mail administrator:

<OL><P><LI>If the user is a local user and the record is missing from the
   ADMIN.NME file, copy the POL to your Personal Address List (PAL),
   add the user there, and then copy your PAL to the POL.
<P>
   The following procedure assumes that the administrator mailbox
   still exists and the 8-digit hexadecimal ID (hexid) is 00000000.
   If you are using an account other than 00000000, substitute the
   8-digit hexid for that account for 00000000.
<P>
   a. Obtain the user's mailbox name. From the Administrator program
<P><PRE>      Config menu, choose Password. Note the postoffice and network
      names.
</PRE><P>
   b. At the MS-DOS command prompt, change to the NME subdirectory of
<P><PRE>      the Mail database.
</PRE><P>
   c. Make a backup of the POL by typing the following command:
<P>
<PRE>         copy admin.nme admin.old

   d. Make a backup of your PAL by typing:

         copy 00000000.nme 00000000.old

      If 00000000.NME is a 0-byte file, copying may not work. You can
      safely skip this step.

   e. Copy the POL to the PAL by typing:

         copy admin.nme 00000000.nme

   f. Move up one directory level from the NME subdirectory (by typing
      CD..).

   g. Start the MS-DOS Mail client and sign in using the admin mailbox
      by typing:

         mail admin -p&lt;password&gt;

   h. From the Address menu, choose Enter. At the prompts, type in the
      mailbox, postoffice, and network names you noted in step a
      above. (If you have other address types, choose the Microsoft
      Mail type and the Admin program will then prompt you for the
      above.) Type in the data noted from Step 1. It will bring up the
      alias. Press the ENTER key.

   i. Quit out of the Mail client.

   j. At the MS-DOS command prompt, change to the NME directory of the
      Mail database.

   k. Copy the PAL to the POL by typing:

         copy 00000000.nme admin.nme
         copy 00000000.nme adminshd.nme

   l. Move up one directory level from the NME subdirectory (by typing
      CD..).

   m. Start the Administrator program. You should now be able to
      delete the problem user account.

   Once you have successfully deleted the user account, delete the
   ADMIN.OLD file and copy 00000000.OLD to 00000000.NME. (If you
   skipped step d above, you do not need to copy 00000000.OLD to
   00000000.NME.)

</PRE><P><LI>If the user record is present in the POL but is corrupted, perform
   the following steps:
<P>
   a. Send to Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) the access
<P><PRE>      (ACCESS.*) files and the ADMIN.NME file.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      A support engineer will verify information in the access file,
      correct the record in the ADMIN.NME file, and return your
      ADMIN.NME file to you.
</PRE><P>
   b. Copy the corrected ADMIN.NME over ADMINSHD.NME. You should be
<P><PRE>      able to delete the user.
</PRE><P>
   Note: Do not make any modifications to the POL between the time you
   send the ADMIN.NME and the time you receive the corrected ADMIN.NME
   from PSS.

<P><LI>If the user is an external postoffice user added to the POL and the
   user record is present in the POL but is corrupted, send to PSS the
   ADMIN.NME file and the xxxxxxxx.USR file for the external
   postoffice the user is on.
<P>
   To find out the xxxxxxxx number, perform the following steps:
<P>
   a. Type out the NETWORK.GLB file. Find the 8-digit number of the
<P><PRE>      network the user is on.
</PRE><P>
   b. Type out that 8-digit.XTN file. This file should show the
<P><PRE>      8-digit numbers for the external postoffices. Find the 8-digit
      number of the postoffice the user is on. That number is the USR
      file needed by PSS.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      With the ADMIN.NME and xxxxxxxx.USR files, the PSS engineer will
      verify the information in the USR file, correct the record in
      the ADMIN.NME file, and return your ADMIN.NME file to you.
</PRE><P>
   c. Copy ADMIN.NME to ADMINSHD.NME. You should be able to delete the
<P><PRE>      user.
</PRE><P>
   Note: Do not make any modifications to the POL between the time you
   send the ADMIN.NME and the time you receive the corrected ADMIN.NME
   from PSS.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the steps above do not work, try one of the following:

<OL><P><LI>Double-check the spelling of all problem names, along with the
   network and postoffice names. Often the type number is corrupted to
   00, and the name will be blank or will contain garbage characters.

<P><LI>Obtain and use the ACCTONME utility included in application note
   WA0641, "Database Maintenance Utilities," which you can obtain from
   Microsoft Product Support Services. There are some side effects to
   using this utility that are explained in the ACCTONME.TXT file
   included with the utility.
