The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, running with
   Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0 or 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Server and User Setup programs provided with Microsoft Electronic Forms
Designer assume that form users can connect to a network to run the User
Setup program, and that users can access the sample E-forms from a shared
location on the network. Some users, such as those using version 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, may not be able to connect to the
network to run User Setup or to access shared E-forms.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you do not connect to the network, you can install the E-form run-time
files and sample E-forms by using the Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer
disks and following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert Disk 1 of the Electronic Forms Designer into the floppy disk
   drive of the remote machine.

<P><LI>From the Windows File Manager, run the SETUP.EXE program from the root
   directory of Disk 1. When the first dialog box appears, choose the
   Server Setup option.

<P><LI>In the third dialog box, specify the local Windows directory as the
   location for files (for example, C:\WINDOWS). Follow the prompts to
   complete Server Setup.

<P><LI>From the Windows File Manager, run the SETUP.EXE program that Server
   Setup created in the local WINDOWS\EFORMS directory. This adds form
   commands to MSMAIL.EXE and makes the local copies of the sample forms
   available when you are offline from the network.

<P><LI>To save disk space, use the Windows File Manager to remove unnecessary
   files created by Server Setup. To do this, delete the WINDOWS\RUNTIME
   directory along with all the files it contains, and delete all files in
   the WINDOWS\EFORMS directory. DO NOT delete the PHONE and ROUTE
   directories or the files they contain, because they allow you to work
   with the phone and routing forms when you are not connected to the
   network.

<P><LI>In step 4 above, User Setup created a SharedExtensionsDir entry in the
   MSMAIL.INI file that references the local Windows directory. If you also
   need access to forms or other Microsoft Mail extensions stored in a
   shared location, copy the custom message declarations in the SHARED.INI
   file into the [Custom Messages] section of the MSMAIL.INI file. In each
   declaration copied to MSMAIL.INI, replace &lt;ExtsDir&gt; with C:\WINDOWS\ and
   change the SharedExtensionsDir entry to reference the shared location on
   the network.

<P><LI>In step 4 above, User Setup created an entry in the Custom Commands
   section of the local MSMAIL.INI file. The entry adds a Select E-Form
   command to the Mail menu. The access key for the Select E-Form command
   is "S." The Microsoft Mail Remote client also uses "S" as the access key
   for the remote "Settings" command. You can change the access key for the
   Select E-Form command by repositioning the ampersand (&amp;) character in
   the custom command declaration.
