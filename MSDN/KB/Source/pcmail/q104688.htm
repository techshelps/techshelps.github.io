The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you set up WordPerfect version 5.1 or 5.2 for Windows, WordPerfect
does not correctly add a file association under Microsoft Windows. As a
result, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows does not
receive or send attachments correctly.
<P>
By default, WordPerfect for Windows does not establish extensions for its
files. The result of this is that you are not able to attach files, nor can
you see the WordPerfect icon. Instead, you will see a document icon with a
folded upper-right corner and the document name below it.
<P>
When you try to open the file, the following error message is displayed in
a dialog box labeled Microsoft Mail:
<P>
<PRE>   Stop. The application for the attached file &lt;filename&gt; (or one of
   its components) could not be found.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The error is not from Mail for Windows, but is the result of the
WordPerfect for Windows file not having any association within Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are two methods to establish an association for WordPerfect
for Windows files:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Using any ASCII editor, open the WIN.INI file.

<P><LI>Find the [Extensions] section.

<P><LI>Using one of the default entries as a template, add the new WordPerfect
   extension.

<P><LI>Close Windows and restart to force a reread of the WIN.INI.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From File Manager, select the file with the desired extension.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Associate.

<P><LI>Either choose the program from the list box or use the Browse feature to
   find WPWIN.EXE.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Method 2 automatically makes the WIN.INI entry and the registration
database modifications without the need to close and restart Windows.
<P>
You need to complete one of the above methods at every workstation where
you want this feature. When you have finished establishing an association
for WordPerfect for Windows files, users attaching or receiving WordPerfect
documents with the appropriate extensions will see the WordPerfect for
Windows icon.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To successfully use the Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) feature of Mail
for Windows, Windows must have a file association to work with. It is
important to understand that Windows cannot associate a file whose filename
does not have a three-letter extension.
<P>
Administrators can choose any number of file associations, within the
limits of the WIN.INI file size, according to your needs. Once these
associations are chosen, you need to add them to the Windows WIN.INI file.
<P>
WordPerfect for Windows is manufactured by WordPerfect Corporation, a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
