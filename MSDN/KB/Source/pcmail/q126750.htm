<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When multiple Microsoft Mail Externals access the same postoffice located
on a PC-NFS server, the following errors may appear in the SYSTEM.LOG:
<P>
<PRE>   [005] Mail retry count exceeded sending to: MAILNET /MAILP0
   [016] Message was not sent due to missing message file.
         Missing file is M:MAI\MA3\000162B3.MAI.
   [021] Message was not delivered due to missing routing file.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when two or more Externals attempt to access the
INQUEUE3.MBG and INQUEUE3.KEY files simultaneously. Normally, file locking
is used to avoid a conflict. The above errors occur when PC-NFS file
locking has not been enabled.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
PC-NFS requires two procedures to enable file locking on shared file
systems located on Sun servers. First, install the lock daemon included
with PC-NFS on the server. Second, include the /MUSTSHARE or /MS command to
the command line of the mount command that each External performs. The
command is detailed on page 76 in the "Administration Guide" of PC-NFS
version 5.0.
<P>
<PRE>   Example: NET USE     M: server:/usr1/mail32 /ms

</PRE>The command can be performed on the command line, or it can be entered in
the DRIVES.BAT file and performed when the redirector is started.
<P>
The network can be started using a NETWORK.BAT file in the directory
including the NFS files on the local drive. The file will include entries
indicating the user or workstation login.
<P>
<PRE>   Example: NET START RDR wkstation *

</PRE>The machine specific addresses are located in the hosts file on each
workstation. There is also another hosts file located on the server that
will include the addresses of each user's workstation.
<P>
<PRE>   Example:   130.50.55.115   wkstation
      130.50.5.55     server

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To verify that the workstations have the /MS option enabled, perform a
trace on the network. If the /MUSTSHARE option is enabled, the workstation
will send UDP packets to the server. Network Monitor will show the
following text in the description of the UDP packet:
<P>
<PRE>   Src Port: Locus PC-Interface Conn Server

</PRE>Testing was done with version 5.0 of PC-NFS. File locking is described in
PC-NFS Administration Guide appendix A. PC-NFS is a product of SunSelect,
which is a Sun Microsystems business.
