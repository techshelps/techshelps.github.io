<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, to successfully delete a
message from a shared folder, DELETE privileges are required. If a user
attempts to delete a message from a shared folder without
having the DELETE privilege, the following error will occur:
<P>
<PRE>   The owner of this shared folder has not granted other users permission
   to perform this action.  Look at Folder Properties to see which actions
   are permitted.

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Folder privileges can only be granted by the folder owner. To modify folder
privileges the owner must do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Select the desired folder.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Folder Properties.

<P><LI>Select the desired privileges and choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are three folder privileges: READ, WRITE, and DELETE. When a user
creates a Shared Folder, READ and WRITE are the default privileges
assigned. The user creating the folder is considered the owner. The folder
owner can delete from any shared folder they create with only the default
READ and WRITE privileges. However, for other users to be able to delete
messages from shared folders, they must have the DELETE privilege.
<P>
For more information about how to establish the folder owner, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
