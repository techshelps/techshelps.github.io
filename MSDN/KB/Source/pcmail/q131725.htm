The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0b, 3.2, and 3.2a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In versions 3.0b, 3.2, and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if you
attempt to add one or more external or gateway users to a Personal Group,
where one or more of the addresses currently exist in the Personal Address
Book (PAB), and IMPORT.EXE as well as REBUILD.EXE has been executed on the
postoffice, the following error may occur:
<P>
<PRE>   Some entries could not be added to the group.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If the entries were originally added to the PAB from the Global Address
List (GAL), and IMPORT.EXE and REBUILD.EXE were executed on the postoffice,
the Windows client thinks that a discrepancy has occurred between the
account information being added and the current entry in the PAB; even
though no change has been made to the actual address.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.2, and 3.2a
of Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching the problem and will post
new information here in the Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
