The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh workstation, versions
   3.0, 3.0a, 3.0b, 3.2, and 3.2a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides a replacement for the Macintosh client file that is
included with versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.0b, 3.2, and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks.
<P>
For complete information about obtaining and installing the Macintosh
client file, see the following sections:

<UL><LI>To download the updated file
<LI>To update your Macintosh client file
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This update contains the Macintosh client file, a replacement for the
Macintosh client file included with versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.0b, and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This update includes the following
modifications:

<UL><LI>With the earlier version of this file, the computer could stop
   responding when sending a message to a personal group under low
   memory conditions. The Macintosh client file has been modified to
   correct this problem.

<LI>Some network operating systems will not allow a file to be created
   in all uppercase letters. The Macintosh client file has been
   modified for these types of networks to allow the client to create
   filenames in lowercase letters if LOWRCASE.GLB exists in the GLB
   subdirectory of the Mail database.

<LI>With the earlier version of this file, when mail is sent to global
   groups that contain nonalphabetic characters in their names, the
   recipient field appears blank when the message is viewed by a Mail
   for Windows user. The Macintosh client file has been modified to
   correct this problem.
<P>
</UL>This replacement file also resolves the following problems that can occur
when you use version 3.0, 3.0a, 3.0b, 3.2, or 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks:

<UL><LI>Extended template information that exceeds 64K is now correctly
   displayed when you choose the Info button in the Addressing dialog box
   of the Macintosh client.

<LI>The Macintosh client has been modified to enable you to address mail to
   an X.400 recipient when the address exceeds 52 characters. Attempting
   to do this with previous versions of the Macintosh client could produce
   the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The application "unknown" has unexpectedly quit, because an error
      of type 1 occurred. OK?
</PRE>
<LI>If you attempt to forward a message in the Macintosh client, and
   you choose not to forward an attachment to that message, the following
   error message is generated:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Low on Memory. Unable to complete the operation. Please close some
      windows.
</PRE><P>
   The Macintosh client has been modified to forward the message without
   generating the error.

<LI>On a Power Macintosh, if the check box Open "To" Address Selector
   (from the Compose menu, select Get Info) is selected, and you
   attempt to forward or reply to a message, the following error
   message is generated and can hang the machine:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The system has closed the following application "Unknown"
      because of an error type 1".
</PRE><P>
   The Macintosh client has been modified to forward or reply to
   a message without generating the error or hanging the machine.

</PRE><h3>To update your Macintosh client file</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: The Macintosh client file is in a self-extracting archive (.SEA)
format as well as in Bin-Hex (.HQX) format to allow you to use an MS-DOS-
formatted disk. To access the workstation software, you need to decode the
file using a decoding utility, such as StuffIt or Compact Pro. These
utilities can be found on most major bulletin boards, such as America
Online and AppleLink.
<P>
<P><h3>From an IBM or compatible computer</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;path&gt;:\maclient.hqx &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you downloaded the
   MACLIENT.HQX file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where
   your postoffice currently resides. For example, if you downloaded the
   file to the TEST directory on drive D and the postoffice is located
   in the MAILDATA directory on drive C, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy d:\test\maclient.hqx c:\maildata
</PRE>
<P><LI>From a Macintosh that has access to the Mail postoffice share, use
   one of the decoding utilities, such as StuffIt or Compact Pro, to
   decode the file into its original format by doing the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - To use StuffIt: From the Other menu, choose Bin-Hex. Then select
      Decode Bin-Hex File.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - To use Compact Pro: From the Misc menu, choose Convert FROM
      BinHex4.
</PRE><P>
   The utility will generate a Macintosh file called MACLIENT.SEA
   in the same location as the original file.

<P><LI>Each Macintosh user can then use AppleShare to update his or her
   Mail client software by copying MACLIENT.SEA from the MAILDATA
   subdirectory of the postoffice to the local Macintosh.
<P>
   The MACLIENT.SEA file is a self-extracting archive. Double-click
   the icon to extract the Microsoft Mail file.
<P>
</OL><h3>From an Apple Macintosh</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you download MACLIENT.SEA, go to step 2.
<P>
   If you download the .HQX file, use one of the decoding utilities, such
   as StuffIt or Compact Pro, to decode the file into its original format
   by doing the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - To use StuffIt: From the Other menu, choose Bin-Hex. Then select
      Decode Bin-Hex File.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - To use Compact Pro: From the Misc menu, choose Convert FROM
      BinHex4.
</PRE><P>
   The utility will generate a Macintosh file called MACLIENT.SEA
   in the same location as the original file.

<P><LI>Copy the file to a share that each Macintosh user has access to,
   such as the MAILDATA subdirectory of the postoffice. Then using
   AppleShare, each Macintosh user can update his or her
   Mail client software by copying MACLIENT.SEA from the MAILDATA
   subdirectory of the postoffice to the local Macintosh and
   double-clicking it to extract the Macintosh file.
