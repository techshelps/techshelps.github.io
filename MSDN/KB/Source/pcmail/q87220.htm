<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In all cases, any mail that fails to be delivered is either returned
to the sender or copied to a location where the administrator can
retrieve and re-submit it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When sending mail from the LAN, a Microsoft Mail user can address mail
to any user on any VM node name. Mail can be addressed incorrectly in
any of the following ways:

<OL><P><LI>If the message is addressed to an invalid node name, it is returned
   to the originator with an error message. (Note that this is dependent
   on the Host Access code being at least version 3.1; earlier versions
   of Host Access send the message to the VM INFORM_ID as an incident
   report.)

<P><LI>If the MS Mail user sends a message addressed to a valid node name,
   but an invalid user, it is trapped by the remote node's RSCS. The
   originator will never know that the mail did not reach its intended
   destination. This behavior, although not ideal, is consistent with
   the way things work in VM.

<P><LI>If a VM user sends mail to an invalid node name, mail is returned
   to the VM user quickly.

<P><LI>If the VM user sends a message to a valid node name, but an invalid
   user, the situation is the same as in item 2 above.

<P><LI>If mail is addressed correctly, but fails in the transfer from LAN
   to host (or vice versa), the mail is copied into the VMGATE\ERR
   directory of the mail system database. The LAN administrator is
   informed of this occurrence and can resubmit the file to the VMGATE
   directory.
