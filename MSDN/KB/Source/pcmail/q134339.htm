The following is a list of frequently asked questions about Microsoft Mail
gateways.

<PRE> 1. Q. What are the most common gateway issues listed in the Microsoft
       Knowledge Base?

 2. Q. What is MHS, and how does it relate to the Microsoft Mail Gateway to
       MHS?

    A. Message Handling Service, MHS, is a product sold by Novell.  It
       consists of three components: a directory manager, a connectivity
       manager, and a transport server. The directory manager is an
       administrative tool used to define the MHS database. The
       connectivity manager routes messages within the database. The
       transport server transfers messages from one MHS database to
       another. MHS databases communicate with each other asynchronously.
       Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS is a gateway application that conforms
       to the Standard Message Format version 70 (SMF70) specification. It
       retrieves messages from Microsoft Mail and converts them into the
       SMF70 format, then deposits them in the MHS database. From here, the
       MHS connectivity manager is responsible for final delivery to the
       recipient. The gateway will also pick up mail routed to it from the
       MHS connectivity manager, convert it to Microsoft Mail format, and
       deliver it to the Microsoft Mail postoffice.

 3. Q. Does the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS work with NetWare Global
       Messaging (NGM)?

    A. Yes. NGM adheres to SMF71. To be compatible with an SMF70 gateway,
       such as Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, a Novell executable file,
       GWDEMON.EXE, must be running on a dedicated workstation. For more
       information, see Chapter 8 in the NetWare Global Messaging
       Administration Manual.

 4. Q. What is required to configure Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP?

    A. A mail routing host (smart host) in the TCP/IP network is required.
       The smart host may or may not be using the Domain Name Service (DNS)
       to handle message routing.

       If your smart
       host uses          See this article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       DNS                <B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q101459.htm">Q101459</A></B>, "SMTP: GW0645: Configuring the SMTP
                          Gateway &amp; DNS"
       Host tables        <B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q115496.htm">Q115496</A></B>, "SMTP: Configuring the Mail Routing Host
                          Without DNS"

      If the DNS or host table is not configured correctly, you may
      experience errors such as "550  Addressee Unknown."

 5. Q. What causes the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP to hang?

    A. There are five known network configurations that can affect
       Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP reliability:

        - Postoffice (PO) and Gateway should be on the same physical
          network.

        - Use a Mail Relay Host for inbound SMTP mail.

        - Have routers use static routing.

        - Use a 16-bit Network Interface Card (NIC).

        - Use one protocol per NIC (IPX/SPX).

      For more information about these configurations, see <B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q131150.htm">Q131150</A></B>, "SMTP:
      Causes of Hangs on Mail Gateway to SMTP," in the Microsoft Knowledge
      Base.

 6. Q. What is the optimal way to deploy the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP
       in my company?

    A. A small-volume implementation can process up to 10,000 messages a
       day, and consists of one SMTP gateway. A medium-volume
       implementation can process up to 20,000 messages a day, with
       dedicated incoming/outgoing SMTP gateways or with the purchase of an
       additional SMTP gateway. A large-volume implementation can handle
       any number of messages greater than 20,000 a day, and can be
       multiple incoming/outgoing gateways, or both.

       Four possible configurations for small- to large-volume scenarios
       are discussed in the Microsoft Knowledge Base. For more information,
       see <B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q132060.htm">Q132060</A></B>, "SMTP: SMTP Gateway in Small, Medium, and Large
       Organizations."

 7. Q. Why does outgoing mail work, but incoming mail does not, with the
       Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400?

    A. If this is the first time you are setting up the gateway, you must
       add the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 to the "Routing" section in
       the X400ADM.EXE Administrator program.

 8. Q. How many Eicon X.25 cards can the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400
       support?

    A. The Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 can support one Eicon X.25 card
       and one Ethernet card at the same time. Multiple simultaneous
       connections can be processed using both cards, or one on the
       computer running the gateway.

 9. Q. Why am I getting "ERROR 3" errors?

    A. Both the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 and the other X.400 mail
       system must be properly configured for messages to transfer
       properly. This means that each X.400 system must have defined its
       own parameters (nsap, tsap, ssap, MTA name and password, and x.121
       address) and those of the other X.400 system. Some parameters are
       not required; for more information, refer to your Microsoft Mail
       Gateway to SMTP documentation.

10. Q. With the Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS and OfficeVision, why do I
       get better performance with inbound mail than with outbound mail?

    A. The VTAM/NCP parameters and buffer sizes on the PROFS host are not
       configured optimally. Some suggestions for improving performance
       are:

        - Tailor the attachment card buffer size to host VTAM/NCP
          parameters.

        - Check VTAM/NCP host definitions for token-ring (MAXDATA, MAXTSL,
          Class of Service).

        - Adjust the RU size on MODETAB.

11. Q. Why aren't free and busy times flowing between Microsoft Mail and
       IBM PROFS and OfficeVision?

    A. There are two main configuration points for free and busy times to
       flow properly:

       Check AdminSch and make sure there is a gateway definition for the
       VM host that includes the user name, making a complete 10 x 10 x 10
       address. AdminSch should also show the fields "Date Sent" and "Date
       Received," with dates filled in if free and busy times have been
       exchanged. If these fields are blank, check the SCHDIST.LOG file in
       the MAILDATA\LOG subdirectory of the Mail database. Remember to fill
       in a time interval in AdminSch.

       On the Host side, MS-CSM, check the file "schdplus control." This
       file should have comment records, PROFS: records, and PO: records.
       One PO: record should be present for each Microsoft Mail postoffice.
       If a PROFS: or PO: record is missing, exchange of free and busy
       times has not occurred successfully. The SCHDIST.LOG file will
       contain errors recording why this was unsuccessful.

12. Q. How do I disable the cover page and distribution box in the
       Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax?

    A. You cannot disable the cover page or distribution box.

13. Q. With the Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, how do I get inbound faxes
       delivered to the recipient instead of a designated user?

    A. Faxes currently cannot be routed to the intended recipient. Instead,
       they are routed to a designated user, who forwards them to the
       recipient. The technology necessary for a computer program to read
       in a handwritten recipient name and understand the intended
       recipient is not yet available.

14. Q. Can I send attachments from a Microsoft Mail client directly to the
       Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax?

    A. You can only do this with ASCII text attachments. If you need to
       send other types of documents, use the fax printer driver.

15. Q. Why isn't my SNADS mail working?

    A. The SNADS gateway is not a Microsoft product. If you experience
       problems sending mail to and from SNADS, contact your SNADS gateway
       vendor -- either Softswitch or Linkage.

16. Q. How do I get addresses changed from Microsoft Mail format to my
       format?

    A. File Format API (FFAPI) only provides addresses in the form
       10 x 10 x 10. The address lists generated for Microsoft Mail users
       to send mail to FFAPI users can only be in the 10 x 10 x 10 format.
       You can use the Import utility to add lists of FFAPI users to the
       Microsoft Mail address lists. If the FFAPI users have addresses in
       another format, the FFAPI gateway administrator must provide the
       functionality to create a table or conversion code to change the
       addresses from 10 x 10 x 10 format to the desired format; FFAPI does
       not provide a table or conversion utility to change 10 x 10 x 10
       addresses to another format.

17. Q. Why doesn't mail sent to a group work?

    A. Mail messages sent from File Format API (FFAPI) to a group that has
       members on other postoffices besides the FFAPI postoffice will not
       receive the message. FFAPI was not designed to resolve group members
       who receive mail on other postoffices.

18. Q. What does the error "80 - Bad Gateway Service Type" mean?

    A. This error indicates you have created a FFAPI postoffice with the
       same network name as another Microsoft Mail postoffice. You must use
       unique network names.

19. Q. How can I give more memory to the Connection Name Utility (CNU) and
       the Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks server when it is running
       as an extension or an application?

    A. When Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks is running as an
       extension, the administrator can sign in to mail as a network
       manager and can increase the amount of memory allocated to the
       server by choosing the Server Settings option from the Mail menu and
       setting the server memory allocation. Remember that extensions
       cannot be granted for more than half the total amount of memory in
       the machine.

       When the server is running as an application, you can select the
       application and press COMMAND+I. You can then adjust the amount of
       memory allocated in the preferred settings field accordingly. This
       same procedure is applied when you want to allocate more memory to
       the CNU when you are running Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and
       AppleTalk Networks.

20. Q. I just installed the Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk
       Networks and I do not want to wait for the next directory
       synchronization cycle to propagate the address list. Can I update
       both the Macintosh and Intel Mail systems' address lists right away?

    A. Yes, you can:

       1. With the Connection Name Utility (CNU) in the foreground on the
          Macintosh running the gateway, press COMMAND+S or choose Save To
          File from the File menu. A standard file Save As dialog appears.

       2. Choose Desktop.

       3. Open the Intel volume on which the connection store is located.

       4. Open Maildata and continue until you reach the MACGATE folder.

       5. Change "Untitled" in the "Dump World list into" field to a
          filename such as MACLIST.DOC. (NOTE: You can use any 8.3 MS-DOS
          filename.)

       The file that is created by this process is in the format required
       by the Import program (IMPORT.EXE). The R(eplace)
       PCM:proxynet/proxypo command is included at the top of the list as
       well.

       With this file at hand, all Microsoft Mail for PC Networks users who
       are downstream of the Mail for PC Networks gateway can almost
       immediately complete a fresh installation of the connection gateway.
       The administrator can send the address list, along with the
       Connection setup disk, to other Mail for PC Networks administrators,
       who can install the downstream component and the address list in the
       same session, leaving directory synchronization to its normal task
       of updating the global address list of participating postoffices.

       To import the list into a Mail for PC Networks postoffice
       ---------------------------------------------------------

       In the steps listed above, you created a file named MACLIST.DOC and
       placed it in the MACGATE directory in the Mail for PC Networks
       gateway's Mail database. The Import (IMPORT.EXE) and Rebuild
       (REBUILD.EXE) files should also be located in the Mail database. To
       import the list, run the following commands

          import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -d&lt;x&gt; -fmaclist.doc
          rebuild -d&lt;x&gt; -f

       where:

          admin is the administrator account for the postoffice
          &lt;password&gt; is the password for the account
          &lt;x&gt; is the drive letter pointing to the root of the mail database

       The Import utility will update the postoffice network list, and the
       Rebuild utility will update the global address list.

       To reverse the procedure
       ------------------------

       Because it is possible to quickly get the contents of the Macintosh
       All list to the PC Mail environment, it is also possible to reverse
       the direction and insert the contents of the global address list
       into the All list.

       1. From the CNU, press COMMAND+I and choose the complete directory
          option.

       2. Watch the Macgate monitor and observe the import request cross
          the gateway.

       3. From an administrator directory on a local computer, run the
          following commands against the directory synchronization server

             srvmain -r -d&lt;x&gt;
             srvmain -t -d&lt;x&gt;
             external -d&lt;x&gt; -0 -a
             external -d&lt;x&gt; -0 -a

          where &lt;x&gt; points to the drive letter of the mail database

       4. Confirm that MACGATE.EXE delivers a message to the network
          manager of the gateway Macintosh postoffice. The subject of the
          message will be similar to the following:

             From: $SYSTEM    Subject: SrvTx R=(a digit) S=(multiple
             digits)

       5. Do nothing with this message. Bring the CNU forward. Choose
          Application from the Configure menu and set the receive updates
          time to 5 minutes ahead of the current Macintosh system time.
          When that time passes, you will see the system message removed
          from the network manager's inbox. In approximately 30 minutes,
          the contents of the global address list will be incorporated into
          the All list.

       6. Restore the receive updates time to its original setting.
