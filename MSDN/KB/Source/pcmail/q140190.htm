The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2a, 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The CONVERT.EXE utility dated 06/09/95, included with Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, does not reliably convert Macintosh user-created private
postoffice folders containing large Macintosh attachments.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh workstation, under certain
circumstances, will create erroneous Federal Information Processing Systems
(FIPS) message attachment header fields in private folders. The fields will
appear to be valid. However, they will not actually point to any valid
attachment, and the data contained within the FIPS attachment field will be
random. The attempt to read by CONVERT.EXE results in random data from
within the folder being read as an attachment, or it attempts to read past
the end of the folder itself.
<P>
The size of the message folder may have some effect on the problem, where
messages with smaller attachments appear to convert correctly. The
CONVERT.EXE utility is a shell that calls MSSFS.DLL from the Windows client
to do the actual conversion. The following error will occur during a failed
conversion:
<P>
<PRE>   The folder conversion process was halted by an error while copying.
   No folders or messages were converted.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with CONVERT.EXE dated
06/09/95 and version 3.5 of MSSFS.DLL. This problem was corrected in
version 3.5.4092 or later of MSSFS.DLL.
