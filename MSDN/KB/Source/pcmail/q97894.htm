The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There is more than one dialog box to change your password in version
3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.
<P>
These change different passwords. They are not for the same use,
although the actual password can be the same.
<P>
In some cases, you might have to change both your password and driver to
access all of your different mail systems.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Mail Remote for Windows Driver</h3>
 
<P>
With the Mail Remote driver loaded in Mail Remote for Windows, there
are two passwords. One for local Sign-In (access to your mail) and the
other for dialing in to your postoffice.
<P>
The first option changes your local password, allowing you security
over your local message store file. By default, this file's name is
MSMAIL.MMF and is located in your Windows directory. When the Change
Password dialog box is activated from the Mail menu, its title is
Change Password.
<P>
If you select Dialin Password from the Mail, Communications dialog
box, the dialog is titled Dialin Password. The password referred to in
the option Dialin Password contains the password needed by modem users
to access their postoffice. This password is set by your Mail
Administrator. If you change it without being told to by the Mail
Administrator, you will no longer be able to connect to your
postoffice.
<P>
<P><h3>AT&amp;T Mail Driver</h3>
 
<P>
With the AT&amp;T Mail driver loaded in Mail Remote for Windows, there are
also multiple passwords. There are references to both a password and a
secondary password when you choose the Change Password option on the
Mail menu in the Sign-In screen when you start Mail.
<P>
The reference to password provides two functions: local access to mail
(password to your MS_ATT.MMF message store) and it is the primary
password for dialing in to your AT&amp;T Mail host system. A secondary
password is optional with AT&amp;T mail -- it is not required for either
local (.MMF) access or for host (dial-in) access.
<P>
Because your local (primary) password must be used for both local and
host access, you should not change the password without notice from
AT&amp;T mail. If you change your local password, you will not get access
to AT&amp;T mail hosts through your modem. You must get this password only
from AT&amp;T. As such, do not change your primary password unless you get
confirmation first from AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T will give you your password -- you
cannot choose your own password.
<P>
If you choose to use a secondary password, you can change this
yourself. Use the Terminal option on the Mail menu to dial in to the
AT&amp;T host directly and change your secondary password on the host
first. Then use your Mail, Change Password option to change the
password as it is stored in Mail Remote for Windows.
<P>
NOTE: This is in the Help file for AT&amp;T and the Microsoft Mail Product
Support Help file installed by Setup when you setup Mail Remote for
Windows.
<P>
When you load the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks driver with Mail
Remote for Windows, the Sign-In password is first checked against the
password assigned to your account on your postoffice by your Mail
Administrator. This password must match the password for your .MMF
file if you have a local file already created.
<P>
If you have a local .MMF with a different password than your Network
Administrator has assigned you, using the Network Mail driver will not
allow you access to that .MMF. The easiest option is to have your
Administrator change your Network-Access password, or Sign-In to your
own account with the Microsoft Mail for MS-DOS client and change your
password to match the password you use for your local .MMF file.
<P>
If that is not an option, switch back to a driver that will allow you
access to your local .MMF and change your Local-Access password to
match the password assigned by your Mail Administrator. Then load the
Network Mail driver and start Mail.
<P>
Another option is to rename your local .MMF file so it is not
MSMAIL.MMF. Once you start Mail Remote for Windows and it does not
find your local file (because you renamed it), Mail will prompt you to
create a new .MMF file. This file will have the password assigned by
your Mail Administrator for Network Mail Access.
