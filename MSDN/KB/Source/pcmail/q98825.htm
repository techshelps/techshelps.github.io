The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS and OfficeVision, versions 2.1b
   and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the version 2.1 or 3.0 Microsoft Mail Gateway to IBM PROFS
and OfficeVision (PROFS Gateway) Import option from within the Microsoft
Mail Administrator program, the PROFS user list may not be imported into
the Microsoft Mail postoffice.
<P>
For the PROFS gateway, this means that the Nickname file is not downloaded
to the postoffice. The PROFS gateway reports that the import request file
of 720 bytes is transferred to the VM host, but no user list is transferred
back down to the postoffice.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE/RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Three known causes of this problem and their resolutions are:

<UL><LI>The Nickname file is not designated in the PWAINIT DATA file on the
   VM host ID.
<P>
   In the PWAINIT DATA file, there is a parameter that designates the
   name of the system Nickname file. If the filename and file type of
   the system nickname file are missing, the PROFS USERS file cannot
   be generated and the PROFS user fails to download.

<LI>The PROFS USERS file is missing or was not created on the gateway
   VM ID 191 disk.
<P>
   The VM Administrator should check the VM ID 191 disk to ensure that
   the PROFS USERS file has not been deleted or renamed.
<P>
   This USERS file is automatically created when the host side of the
   gateway is started, if the NICKNAME is designated in the PWAINIT
   DATA file and the PROFS USERS file does not already exist.
<P>
   To regenerate the PROFS USERS file, restart the VM ID.

<LI>The node created within the Administrator program does not match
   nodes in the PROFS Nickname files on the host.
<P>
   When you mail from a Microsoft Mail postoffice to PROFS, the
   addressing is simplified by creating a node within the Mail
   Administrator program (select Gateway, PROFS, Node, Create).
<P>
   When you use the gateway Import option, the nodes selected are
   searched for within the PROFS USERS file on the host. The user
   names corresponding to the selected nodes are then downloaded to
   Microsoft Mail. These names are then automatically imported into
   the postoffice.
