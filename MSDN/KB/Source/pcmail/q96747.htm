<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0b and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides a replacement for the VFORMS.DLL file that is included
with versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.
<P>
For complete information about obtaining and installing the VFORMS.DLL
file, see the following sections:

<UL><LI>To download the updated file
<LI>To update your VFORMS.DLL file
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This update contains VFORMS.DLL, a replacement for the VFORMS.DLL file that
is included with versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows. This
replacement file provides additional enhancements to the original
VFORMS.DLL, resolving the following two problems that can occur when
attachments are launched using version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for Windows:

<UL><LI>When you attempt to launch attachments that do not have an
   extension, an error occurs when you hold down the ALT key and
   double-click the mouse button to load the attachment in Notepad.

<LI>When you attempt to launch MACBINARY attachments, Mail for Windows
   changes the name of the file being launched if that filename is
   less than eight characters in length.
<P>
</UL>This replacement file also resolves the following problems that can
occur when you use version 3.0b or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows:

<UL><LI>When you open a MAPI Send note through a Windows-based application
   (for example, Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel) and the
   application is launched again via Mail, the application is brought
   to the front, but the Send note is left in the background. If the
   application is running full screen, the computer hangs because the
   active window (the Send note) will accept any keystrokes; however,
   it is hidden by the full-screen application.
<P>
</UL><h3>To Download the Updated File</h3>
 
<P>
The following self-extracting file is available for download from the
Microsoft Software Library:
<P>
<PRE> ~ <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/Vformupd.exe">Vformupd.exe</A> <I>(size: 85531 bytes)</I> 

</PRE>For more information about downloading files from the Microsoft Software
Library, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q119591.htm">Q119591</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE>After you download VFORMUPD.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing
"vformupd" at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of the file.
You should receive the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   VFORMS.DLL  (143,552 bytes, dated 01-28-94, 2:56 P.M.)
   README.TXT

</PRE><h3>To replace your VFORMS.DLL file</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\vforms.dll &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
   extracting VFORMUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and
   directory where your VFORMS.DLL file currently resides. This directory
   should also contain the Microsoft Mail for Windows SETUP.EXE program.
   For example, if you ran the self-extracting file from the TEST
   directory on drive D, and your VFORMS.DLL file is located in the
   MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy d:\test\vforms.dll c:\mailexe
</PRE>
<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;mailexe&gt;\setup.inf &lt;mailexe&gt;\setupinf.old
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;mailexe&gt; is the complete path to the directory containing
   the Microsoft Mail for Windows SETUP.EXE program. For example, if
   SETUP.EXE is located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the
   following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\mailexe\setup.inf c:\mailexe\setupinf.old
</PRE>
<P><LI>Using any text editor, edit the SETUP.INF file. In the [MsMail
   System] section, replace the following line
<P>
<P><PRE>      1, vforms.dll,,,, 1993-03-09, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY
      ,,,,, SHARED, 142960,,,, 3.2.0.4027 ,
</PRE><P>
   with:
<P>
<P><PRE>      1, vforms.dll,,,, 1994-01-28, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY
      ,,,,, SHARED, 143552,,,, 3.2.0.4064 ,
</PRE><P>
   Save the file and close the text editor.
<P>
   NOTE: For these changes to affect the entire network, each existing
   user must run Setup again.
