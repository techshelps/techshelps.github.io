<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0 and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Mail for Windows includes a utility called CONVERT.EXE that
converts Microsoft Mail MS-DOS client folders and Microsoft Mail for
Windows version 2.1 folders so that they can be used with versions 3.0 and
3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows. Microsoft Mail version 2.1 stores
private folders in .FLD files. These .FLD files are indexed with the .IDX
file. These folders can be stored on the server or locally. When the
folders are stored locally, the user's .IDX file and .FLD files are moved
to the path specified by the user.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
CONVERT.EXE is a Windows utility that reads the .IDX file and then copies
the information from the .FLD files into your .MMF file. When the
CONVERT utility is finished copying the information, the following dialog
box will appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Convert has successfully transferred your old messages to the new
   format. If you do not need the old messages, you may delete them at this
   time. Do you want to keep the old messages?

</PRE>You can choose YES to keep the .IDX file and .FLD files or choose NO
to reset the .IDX file back to 100 bytes and delete the .FLD files. If the
folders were stored on the server, the .FLD files will be deleted
successfully. However, if the folders were stored locally, the IDX file
will be reset but the .FLD files will not be deleted. The .FLD files will
no longer be accessible via the MS-DOS Mail client but they will still
exist in the directory where they were stored locally. Therefore, you
will need to delete the .FLD files located on the local workstation.
