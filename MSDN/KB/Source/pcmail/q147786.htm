</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses how the NT-MMTA uses account names and passwords to
make dynamic connections to Novell postoffices. It also covers the two ways
to launch the NT-MMTA, as a service or as an application (from CMD line).
<P>
There are four different ways that account name and password information
can be provided to the system: 1) the DrivesUNC parameters in the
EXTERNAL.INI file, 2) the username and password from the initial Windows NT
logon, 3) the username and password assigned to the service account, and
4)the username and password used to log into the NetWare Preferred Server,
if Gateway/Client Services for NetWare has been installed. The remainder of
this section includes a discussion of each of these four scenarios.
<P>
General Comments:
<P>
The Username and Password parameters, if specified on the DrivesUNC line in
the EXTERNAL.INI file or on the command line, will always take precedence.
<P>
Additionally, if the username and password parameters are specified on the
DrivesUNC line, both of these parameters MUST be included. A null password
will not work on the DrivesUNC line. The logon account and the service
account are independent of the dynamic connection to the Novell server in
this case.
<P>
Following are 2 summaries of how the user is validated on the NetWare
postoffices if the Username and Password parameters are NOT specified on
the DrivesUNC line.

<OL><P><LI>With the NT-MMTA running as an application from the command line, the
   account name and password that were used to login to the NT machine will
   be passed to the NetWare servers for authentication. If an account is
   set up on each NetWare server with the same name and password as the
   login account for the NT machine, then dynamic connections will be made
<P><PRE>    successfully. An exception to this will be if a login to a Novell
</PRE>   Preferred server has been made using GSNW. If that is the case, and
   there is not a username and password specified on the DrivesUNC line,
   then the Preferred server credentials will be passed.

<P><LI>With the NT-MMTA running as a service, the account name and password of
   the service account will be used to log into the server to make the
   dynamic connection. If an account is set up on each NetWare server with
   the same name and password as the NT-MMTA service account, then dynamic
   connections will be made successfully whether the service is started
   manually or automatically. The entire process is independent of the
   account used to log onto the NT machine where the NT-MMTA is running.
   These logons are also independent of the credentials used to log into
   a Preferred Server in that the service account credentials will take
   precedence over the Preferred server account credentials.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
I. RUNNING THE NT-MMTA AS A SERVICE:
<P>
Situation 1:
<P>
<PRE>NT Logon account:  TEST          Password:  TEST
NT Service account: TEST      Password:  TEST
Novell Postoffice account:  TEST    Password:  TEST

</PRE></OL>The following 2 DrivesUNC options will allow a dynamic connection to the
Novell PO:
<P>
DrivesUNC=\\server\volume\maildata TEST TEST
<P>
-or-
<P>
DrivesUNC=\\server\volume\maildata
<P>
Situation 2:
<P>
<PRE>NT Logon account:  TEST       Password:  TEST
NT Service account: TEST      Password:  TEST
</PRE>Novell Postoffice account: MAILMAN  Password:  MAILMAN
<P>
Only the following DrivesUNC setting will allow a dynamic connection to the
<P>
Novell PO.
<P>
DrivesUNC=\\server\volume\maildata MAILMAN MAILMAN
<P>
Situation 3:
<P>
<PRE>NT Logon account:  TEST       Password:  TEST
NT Service account: MAILMAN      Password:  MAILMAN
</PRE>Novell Postoffice account: MAILMAN  Password:  MAILMAN
<P>
The following DrivesUNC options will work successfully:
<P>
DrivesUNC=\\server\volume\maildata MAILMAN MAILMAN
<P>
-or-
<P>
DrivesUNC=\\server\volume\maildata
<P>
The next three scenarios still describe the NT-MMTA running as a
service, but with a &lt;NULL&gt; password on the Novell Postoffice account:
<P>
Situation 4:
<P>
<PRE>NT account:  TEST          Password:  &lt;NULL&gt;
NT Service account: TEST      Password:  &lt;NULL&gt;
Novell Postoffice account:  TEST    Password:  &lt;NULL&gt;

</PRE>DrivesUNC will *only* work as follows:
<P>
DrivesUNC=\\server\volume\maildata
<P>
If you specify an account name and no password (because the password is
null), the connection will fail.
<P>
Situation 5:
<P>
<PRE>NT Logon account:  TEST       Password:  TEST
NT Service account: TEST      Password:  TEST
</PRE>Novell Postoffice account: MAILMAN  Password:  &lt;NULL&gt;
<P>
This situation will NOT work, because specifying a null password on the
DrivesUNC line is invalid.
<P>
Situation 6:
<P>
<PRE>NT Logon account:  TEST       Password:  TEST
NT Service account: MAILMAN      Password:  &lt;NULL&gt;
</PRE>Novell Postoffice account: MAILMAN  Password:  &lt;NULL&gt;
<P>
This situation will work *only* as follows:
<P>
DrivesUNC=\server\volume\maildata
<P>
Again, if you specify an account name and no password on the DrivesUNC
line, the connection will fail.
<P>
II. RUNNING THE NT-MMTA AS AN APPLICATION (from the command line):
<P>
Situation 1:
<P>
<PRE>NT Logon account:  TEST       Password:  TEST
Novell Postoffice account:  TEST    Password:  TEST

</PRE>The following 2 DrivesUNC options will work successfully:
<P>
DrivesUNC=\\server\volume\maildata TEST TEST
<P>
-or-
<P>
DrivesUNC=\\server\volume\maildata
<P>
Situation 2:
<P>
<PRE>NT Logon account:  TEST       Password:  TEST
</PRE>Novell Postoffice account: MAILMAN  Password:  MAILMAN
<P>
DrivesUNC will work as follows:
<P>
DrivesUNC=\\server\volume\maildata MAILMAN MAILMAN
<P>
-or-
<P>
DrivesUNC=\\server\volume\maildata  *if* a Preferred Server has been logged
into with the Account "MAILMAN" and Password "MAILMAN".
<P>
The next two scenarios still refer to the MMTA running as an application,
but with a &lt;NULL&gt; password on the Novell Postoffice account.
<P>
Situation 3:
<P>
<PRE>NT Logon account:  TEST          Password:  &lt;NULL&gt;
Novell Postoffice account:  TEST    Password:  &lt;NULL&gt;

</PRE>DrivesUNC will *only* work as follows:
<P>
DrivesUNC=\\server\volume\maildata
<P>
Situation 4:
<P>
<PRE>NT Logon account:  TEST          Password:  TEST
Novell Postoffice account: MAILMAN      Password:  &lt;NULL&gt;

</PRE>This situation will not work UNLESS a Preferred Server has been logged into
with Account "MAILMAN" and Password "&lt;null&gt;".
