The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, and 3.2a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for Windows, users
logged on to the mail system are validated for access to the postoffice, as
well as to their message file (.MMF). Changes recorded in a user's account
on a postoffice will not be propagated into the .MMF until the next time
the user logs into Mail.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you log into the postoffice, the mailbox name and password are
used as the credentials to validate you with the postoffice. If the
information does not match the values stored on the postoffice, the
following error will be returned:
<P>
<PRE>   The mailbox name or password is incorrect.

</PRE>Once you have been validated by the postoffice, the Mail client then uses
the your Hex ID value, retrieved from the access files in conjunction with
the password, to validate you against the MMF.
<P>
If both your Hex ID and password match, the your .MMF is opened and
you log in normally.
<P>
If either one of the two values does not match, the errant value will be
updated to match the record the postoffice contains for this value. Two
common examples of this are resetting the password and moving an account to
a different postoffice with MoveUser.
<P>
In the case of a password reset, the password stored in the access files is
changed by the Administrator. Then, when you log into the Windows client
for the first time after the reset, the password field in the MMF will be
different from the password in the access files. The Mail client will then
update the MMF's password field to match that of the postoffice.
<P>
In the case of MoveUser, your account is created on the new postoffice with
a new Hex ID. When you log into the Windows client on the new postoffice
the first time, the password will match, but the Hex ID will not. The Mail
client will then update the Hex ID within the MMF.
<P>
If neither the Hex ID nor the password matches, the Mail client will return
the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   This account is not a valid user of this message file.

</PRE>This can happen when an Administrator resets a user's password and moves
that user with MoveUser without allowing the user to sign on between the
reset and move. Since the MMF will have the old Hex ID and password, the
user will get the above error message.
