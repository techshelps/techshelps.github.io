The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0 and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Wollongong TCP/IP with Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.2, the
Mail Windows client may fail when you access the Mail message file. Error
conditions include:

<UL><LI>Mail cannot send or receive messages because of problems downloading a
   message.

<LI>Microsoft Mail caused segment load failure in module USER.EXE.

<LI>An unexpected memory or network error occurred. Computer informed user
   that changes may have been lost and to quit mail and restart.

<LI>Mail is unable to save information to message file.

<LI>Folder could not be accessed.

<LI>Error occurred while views were being saved. Some views may not be
   restored at start up next time.

<LI>Some information could not be written to disk. Changes may have been
   lost.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by Wollongong's TCP, which does not support the full
command set of Microsoft TCP. When a session is broken, Wollongong TCP does
not inform the workstation, causing Mail to exhibit the behavior above.
<P>
When you run LAN Manager version 2.2, the opportunistic locking function
(called Oplocks and designed to enhance performance by caching server data
on the workstation) disconnects Mail's session. Mail normally opens the
Mail message file twice (for STORE.DLL and MSSFS.DLL). When one of the DLLs
writes to the Mail message file, the server issues an Oplock Broken command
that is supposed to inform all users of the file to flush their buffers and
re-read the server file. This is to ensure that the cached data on the
workstation is current. If the re-read operation does not occur within a
time-out period (definable in the server heuristics) then the connection is
broken by the server to ensure the data on the workstation is valid. When
this happens to Mail, one of the two DLLs (the one that hasn't written to
the Mail message file yet) still attempts to use the (now invalid) session.
The DLL fails and one of the error conditions above occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Do one of the following to eliminate the problems:

<UL><LI>Substitute Microsoft TCP/IP for Wollongong TCP/IP.

<LI>Move the Mail message file to a local storage location.

<LI>Turn the server's Oplock function off. See the LAN Manager
   Administrator's Reference for the specific heuristic value.
