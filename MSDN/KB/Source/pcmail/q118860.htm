<P>
The following is the text of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 Readme
file for version 3.2.
<P>
<PRE>           ===========================================
           MICROSOFT MAIL GATEWAY TO X.400 VERSION 3.2
           ===========================================

</PRE>This document supplements the information in the "Microsoft Mail Gateway
to X.400 Administrator's Guide" and covers these topics:

<OL><P><LI>Gateway Memory Requirements
</OL>2. Corrections to Gateway Installation
<PRE>   2.1 Installing the Gateway Postoffice
   2.2 Converting the Gateway Postoffice to a Downstream Postoffice
</PRE></OL>3. Moving and Using the X.400 Gateway Administrator Program
<PRE>   3.1 Memory Requirements for the Administrator Program
   3.2 Moving the Administrator Program to a Local Drive
   3.3 Viewing Log Files
   3.4 Specifying No Extensions for Inbound Attachment Files
   3.5 Viewing the About Dialog Box
   3.6 Inserting New Lines in the Routing Table
</PRE>4. Updating the X400GATE.INI File (IMPORTANT)
<PRE>   4.1 Specifying Time-Out Values for Transport Connections
   4.2 Specifying An Alternate Recipient
</PRE>5. Correction to Customized Address Mapping
6. Restarting the Gateway after Changes in the Microsoft Mail Administrator
<PRE>   Program


</PRE><P><LI>GATEWAY MEMORY REQUIREMENTS
</OL> 

<UL><LI>The X.400 gateway requires at least 400K of conventional memory on
   the gateway machine after all drivers are loaded.

<LI>The amount of conventional memory available on the gateway machine
   determines the number of recipients and attachments supported in a
   message.
<P>
</UL>Configure the gateway machine for the maximum free conventional memory
possible. To determine the largest executable program size that can be
run, use the MS-DOS MEM command. For additional information about
maximizing conventional memory, consult your MS-DOS and network
operating system documentation.
<P>

<OL><P><LI>CORRECTION TO GATEWAY INSTALLATION
</OL> 
<P>
<P><h3>2.1 Installing the Gateway Postoffice</h3>
 

<UL><LI>In the Administrator's Guide, on page 35 under "To install the Gateway
   Access Component," step 4 should read:
<P>
<P><PRE>      4. When prompted, type the path to the Microsoft Mail data files for
<PRE></PRE>         this gateway postoffice, and then press ENTER.

</PRE></OL><h3>2.2 Converting the Gateway Postoffice to a Downstream Postoffice</h3>
 

<UL><LI>In the Administrator's Guide, on page 40 under "Converting the Gateway
   Postoffice to a Downstream Postoffice," step 4 should be preceded by:
<P>
   - When prompted, type the path to your Microsoft Mail executables, and
<P><PRE>     then press ENTER.
</PRE>
<LI>In the Administrator's Guide, on page 41 under "Converting the Gateway
   Postoffice to a Downstream Postoffice," please ignore step 8. After
   you have completed step 7, the conversion from a gateway postoffice
   to a downstream postoffice will be complete.
<P>

</UL><OL><P><LI>MOVING AND USING THE X.400 GATEWAY ADMINISTRATOR PROGRAM
</OL> 
<P>
To improve performance, you can move the X.400 gateway to another machine.
<P>
<P><h3>3.1 Memory Requirements for the Administrator Program</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The X.400 Gateway Administrator program requires at least 400K of
   conventional memory on the machine that is used to run it.
<P>
</UL>Configure the machine that will run the X.400 Gateway Administrator
program so that it has at least 400K of free conventional memory. To
determine the largest executable program size that can be run, use the
MS-DOS MEM command. For additional information about maximizing
conventional memory, consult your MS-DOS and network operating system
documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>3.2 Moving the Administrator Program to a Local Drive</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Move the Gateway Administrator program to a local hard drive, and then
   start the program from that drive. The Gateway Administrator program
   will run only on a machine with FAT partitions.
<P>
</UL>Create a directory on your local hard disk, and then copy the following
executables into that directory:
<P>
<PRE>   X400ADM.EXE
   ADM2.EXE
   X400CMAP.EXE
   X400DMAP.EXE
   PRINTCFG.EXE
   X400ADM.HLP

</PRE></OL>These files should be located in the path you specify for the executables
directory during installation of the Gateway Component.
<P>
<P><h3>3.3 Viewing Log Files</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If the Gateway is running, you cannot view the log file using the
   View Log File feature in the X.400 Gateway Administrator program.
<P>
</UL><h3>3.4 Specifying No Extensions for Inbound Attachment Files</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If a file extension is not needed for inbound attachments, enter a
   period (.) in the Bodypart Mapping option for inbound mail.
<P>
</UL><h3>3.5 Viewing the About Dialog Box</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If you double-click the center of the menu of the X.400 Gateway
   Administrator program, an About dialog box appears.
<P>
</UL><h3>3.6 Inserting New Lines in the Routing Table</h3>
 

<UL><LI>From the X.400 Gateway Administrator program menu, choose the Routing
   Option.
<P>
</UL>If you are using a mouse:
<P>
<PRE>   - Select the line that precedes the location of the line you want
     to insert.
   - Double-click the mouse.

</PRE>If you are using a keyboard:
<P>
<PRE>   - Select the line that precedes the location of the line you want
     to insert.
   - Press the INSERT key.


</PRE><P><LI>UPDATING THE X400GATE.INI FILE (IMPORTANT)
</OL> 

<UL><LI>You can change the transport connection time-out value, and specify an
   alternate recipient other than the administrator of the gateway by
   updating the X400GATE.INI file.
<P>
</UL>This file is located in the X400 sub-directory of the Microsoft Mail data
files directory. It contains information needed for the correct functioning
of the X.400 gateway, and should not be edited except in the cases
described below.
<P>
If you do edit this file, follow the directions carefully, and do not
change the format of the file.
<P>
<P><h3>4.1 Specifying Time-Out Values for Transport Connections</h3>
 

<UL><LI>When the gateway requests a LAN or X.25 network connection, it
   waits 120 seconds for a connection confirmation. If the gateway
   does not receive the confirmation within this time, it terminates
   the connection request.
<P>
</UL>You can change the time-out value for both stacks by putting a new
section in the X400GATE.INI file.

<OL><P><LI>Add a new section to the end of the X400GATE.INI file. The section
   heading must be [Network].

<P><LI>Add a keyword to specify the time-out value. Only add entries for the
   service requiring a different time-out.
<P>
   For a LAN time-out, specify the TP4Timeout keyword.
   For an X.25 time-out, specify the X25Timeout keyword.
<P>
</OL>Example 1: Time-out of 60 seconds for both LAN and X.25
<P>
<PRE>     [Network]
     TP4Timeout=60
     X25Timeout=60

</PRE></OL>Example 2: Time-out of 180 seconds for X.25
<P>
<PRE>     [Network]
     X25Timeout=180

</PRE><h3>4.2 Specifying the Alternate Recipient Option</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If the intended recipient is not found on an inbound message with
   the Alternate Recipient Field set, by default the alternate recipient
   is the Admin mailbox on the gateway postoffice.
<P>
</UL>You can specify another mailbox as the Alternate Recipient, by adding
a keyword to the X400GATE.INI file.

<OL><P><LI>Add the DeliveryReportsTo= keyword under the [Profile] section
   of the X400GATE.INI file.

<P><LI>Specify the mailbox that you wish to be the alternate recipient
   mailbox using the format: NETWORK/POSTOFFICE/MAILBOX
<P>
</OL>For example, the mailbox that is to be the alternate recipient has this
Microsoft Mail Address:
<P>
<PRE>     Network = NET1
     Postoffice = POST1
     Mailbox = JSMITH

</PRE></OL>To specify the alternate recipient, you add this line under the [Profile]
section in the X400GATE.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>     DeliveryReportsTo=NET1/POST1/JSMITH


</PRE><P><LI>CORRECTION TO CUSTOMIZED ADDRESS MAPPING
</OL> 

<UL><LI>In the Administrator's Guide, on page 127-128 under "Creating the Input
   File," the following example is incorrect.
<P>
<PRE>      MSM:&lt;contoso/WCG/Bill&gt;   X.400:&lt;o=contoso,_Ltd;s=Lee;g=Bill;i=E&gt;

   It should read:

      MSM:contoso/WCG/Bill     X400:o=contoso,_Ltd;s=Lee;g=Bill;i=E

   NOTE: There should be no angle brackets (&lt; &gt;), and X400 should
   not be entered with a period (.) between the X and the 400.


</PRE><P><LI>RESTARTING THE GATEWAY AFTER CHANGES
   IN THE MICROSOFT MAIL ADMINISTRATOR PROGRAM
</OL> 
<P>
Any time you make changes in the Microsoft Mail Administrator program,
you should restart the X.400 gateway so that the gateway can apply those
changes.
