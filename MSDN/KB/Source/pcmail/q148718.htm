The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2 and 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
During Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync), the Dispatch program
(Dispatch.exe) may report the following messages on the screen or on the
Dispatch.log:
<P>
<PRE>   NSDA-RT Missed its run Window

   NSDA-S Missed its run Window

   NSDA-RR Missed its run Window

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These messages are reported when the Dispatch program was unable to run the
task according to the scheduled Dir-Sync times T1, T2, or T3. The Dispatch
program may not have been running or the postoffice may not have been
included in the Dispatch program configuration when the required task was
scheduled to run.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Ensure the T1, T2 and T3 times are scheduled accordingly. Ensure the
Dispatch program and the computer running Dispatch is working and all
postoffices are defined in the Dispatch configuration either via the
Dispatch.ini or the command line. The postoffice will run in its next
scheduled window.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In versions 3.2, 3.2a, and 3.5 of Mail for PC Networks, the scheduled run
window for each Dir-Sync time is 8 hours. If this 8 hour window is missed,
these errors are reported to inform the administrators that the postoffice
did not participate at the scheduled times.
<P>
The processing times, as well as other information, is held in the
Process.glb file. You can view the Process.glb file by running the
Dssched.exe utility.
<P>
The following is an example of a Dssched dump of a Process.glb file:
<P>
Record number 1
ID = 1
Requestor sends updates (Dispatch runs NSDA -RT)
Current time to run NSDA -RT: Fri Dec 22 16:30:00 1995
Run window is 8 hours (28800 seconds)
Time after which this process will not run: Sat Dec 23 00:30:00 1995
If this time is exceeded, an error (missed run window) is recorded.
Next scheduled time is used instead of this time.
This instance next runs on Fri Dec 29 16:30:00 1995
