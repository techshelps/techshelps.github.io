<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h2>Directory Synchronization Error and Status Messages #30 - 59</h2>
 
<P>
On Microsoft Mail for PC Networks version 3.0 Server Disk 1, there is a
file called DIRSYNC.TXT that contains the error codes used in directory
synchronization (Dir-Sync) and in the IMPORT utility for Mail. The errors
are logged in the DIRSYNC.LOG file.
<P>
<PRE>[30]    Error accessing transaction file
   Check to make sure the transaction files exist and/or are not corrupt.
   Files to check are SRVTRANS.GLB, REQTRANS.GLB, USRTRANS.GLB,
   NMETRANS.GLB, and GWTRANS.GLB.

[31]    Network not found
   Check the import file for a network name that is not defined at
   this postoffice.

[32]    Postoffice not found
   Check the import file for a postoffice name that is not defined at
   this postoffice.

[33]    Template file not found
   If you are running Import as a stand-alone utility, use the
   template file (T) code in the import file to import a new template
   file for the requestor. Otherwise, submit an Import request to the
   directory server postoffice with the Administrator program. The
   response to your import request will include the template file.

[34]    Template information not accessible
   Try the operation again. If the problem continues, check that there
   is still a connection to the server. If the connection to the
   server is still intact, check that the specified filename exists
   and is not locked open, preventing Import from accessing it.
   Contact your network vendor to determine how to find and close
   files that are locked open. If the specified filename is ADMIN.INF,
   copy backups of ADMIN.INF and ADMIN.TPL to your data files. If the
   specified filename is for an external postoffice, submit an Import
   request to your directory server postoffice. The response to your
   import request will include the template information.

[35]    Template memory allocation error in file
   Ensure that you are running Import on a computer with at least 640K
   of memory.

[36]    Template mismatch error in file
   The template information in the .INF file does not match the
   template prompts in the .TPL file. If changes are made in one file,
   they must be reflected in the other file. Change the files so that
   they match.

[37]    Prompt not found in template
   Check the import file for lines containing template information
   that do not have a matching prompt in the template file.

[38]    Error loading postoffice template
   Try the operation again. If the problem continues, check that there
   is still a connection to the server.  If the connection to the
   server is still intact, run the Mail program and check an address
   information window for a user in the specified network and
   postoffice. If you cannot see any template prompts and template
   information then either run the import utility with a template file
   code (T) in the import file to import the template file of the
   specified postoffice, or submit an Import request to your directory
   server postoffice. The response to your import request will include
   the template file.

[39]    Error generating TID
   Check that the TID.GLB file exists. If it cannot be found, it must
   have been accidentally deleted and you should restore a back-up of
   your data files. If TID.GLB exists, ensure that it is not locked
   open. Contact your network vendor to determine how to find and
   close files that are locked open.

   The CONTROL.GLB file may be locked open. Contact your network
   vendor to determine how to find and close files that are locked
   open.

[40]    Possible database corruption detected
   In most cases, the problem in the data files is not serious enough
   to prevent successful processing of transactions. If this causes a
   fatal error, restore a backup of your data files.

[41]    Internal sort error
   This is an internal error. Please notify Microsoft Product Support
   Services. Transactions will be processed correctly except if you
   are updating the Postoffice Address List with the -R command line
   option, which requires correct sorting in order to avoid missing
   aliases.

[42]    File already opened and locked
   The network operating system has an open file handle to this file.
   Close the open handle with network utility if one is available.

[43]    Gateway alias has no physical address
   There is no address specified for this gateway alias. Run the
   Administrator program and try to delete the alias. If this is not
   possible, either run Import as a stand-alone utility with the
   Replace (R) code to replace the entire list for this gateway, or
   submit an Import request to your directory server postoffice. The
   response to your import request will include the list for this
   gateway.

[44]    Gateway not installed
   There is a directory synchronization transaction for an address
   type that is not recognized at the postoffice. Install the Gateway
   Access component for this address type before trying to process
   this type of transaction.

[45]    File error sorting queue
   Try the operation again. If the problem continues, check that there
   is still a connection to the server.

[46]    No fullname
   Check the import file for lines that are missing an alias
   (fullname).

[47]     Transaction has no effect
   Check the transaction format for errors.

[48]    Expecting physical address
   Check the import file for lines that are missing an address.

[49]     Fatal error creating network:
   During the autocreate function, the new network name could not be
   created. Make sure the NETWORK.GLB and *.XTN files are not corrupt.

[50]     Fatal error creating postoffice:
   During the autocreate function, the new postoffice name could not be
   created. Make sure the *.XTN files are not corrupt. Ensure the MBG
   and KEY subdirectories are not write protected.

[51]    Error creating mailbag
   Ensure that the computer that is running Import has at least 640K
   of memory. One of the data files could be locked open, so try the
   operation again. Also check that there is still a connection to the
   server. If the problem continues, use the Administrator program to
   create the user.

[52]    Error accessing configuration information
   If this error occurs while running the Import utility, try the
   operation again. If the problem continues, the REQCONF.GLB may be
   locked open. Contact your network vendor to determine how to find
   and close files that are locked open.

   If this problem occurs while running the Dispatch program, try the
   operation again. If the problem continues, check that the MASTER.GLB
   file is in the GLB directory. If it is not there, it may have been
   accidentally deleted and you should restore a backup of your data
   files. If it is there, it may be locked open. Contact your network
   vendor to determine how to find and close files that are locked
   open.

[53]    Unable to read network and postoffice definitions
   Ensure that the computer you are running Import on has at least
   640K of memory. Try the operation again. If the problem continues,
   MASTER.GLB or an .XTN file may be locked open. Contact your network
   vendor to determine how to find and close files that are locked
   open.

[54]    No Server name has been set
   The requestor administrator must specify the directory server
   postoffice before continuing.

[55]    Can't find Dir-Sync Server postoffice definition
   Ensure that the directory server postoffice has been specified at
   the directory server postoffice itself and at all requestors.

[56]    Error accessing input file
   Try the operation again. If the problem continues, check that there
   is still a connection to the server.

   Check for someone editing the Import utility input file (specified
   with -F command line option). If the problem continues, the file may
   be locked open. Contact your network vendor to determine how to
   find and close files that are locked open.

[57]    Error accessing output file
   Try the operation again. If the problem continues, check that there
   is still a connection to the server. If the problem continues, the
   Import utility output file (specified with the -F or -X command
   line option) may be locked open. Contact your network vendor to
   determine how to find and close files that are locked open.

[58]    Error accessing database file
   Ensure that there is still a connection to the server and try the
   operation again. If the problem continues, the specified data file
   may be locked open. Contact your network vendor to determine how to
   find and close files that are locked open.

[59]    Error autocreating postoffice: xxxxxx
   Ensure that the computer running the Import utility has at least
   640K of memory and that there is still a connection to the server.
   One of the data files may be locked open. Contact your network
   vendor to determine how to find and close files that are locked
   open. You can also create the postoffice with the Administrator
   program External-Admin Create command.
