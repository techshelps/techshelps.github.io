The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the following error
message may appear when you work with attachments:
<P>
<PRE>   The attached file "XXXXXXXX.XXX" is currently open. Further changes
   to that file will not be reflected in this message.

</PRE>This message is displayed when the attachment is still open in its
native application when the message containing the attachment is
closed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Mail for Windows creates a copy of the attached file before it
launches the appropriate application. Mail then tells the application
to run using this newly created duplicate file. When it is finished,
Mail tries to clean up these duplicate files. Occasionally (as
depicted in the following "Steps to Reproduce Problem" section), Mail
for Windows is unsuccessful and the duplicate file is left in the
directory specified by the TEMP environment variable.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Mail for Windows.

<P><LI>Compose a Note.

<P><LI>Attach a file (such as an Excel Worksheet).

<P><LI>Double-click the attachment or select the attachment and choose
    Open from the File menu.

<P><LI>Minimize the application containing the attachment.

<P><LI>Close the message containing the launched attachment.

<P><LI>A warning appears, indicating that the attachment is currently
    open. Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>A dialog is displayed asking, "Do you want to save message to
    Inbox?" Select either option, Yes or No.

<P><LI>Mail for Windows now attempts to delete the file in the temporary
    directory. The native application, however, still has the
    attachment open, so the clean up is unsuccessful.

<P><LI>After closing the application, the file will still remain in the
    temporary directory.
<P></OL>
