</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides MMFCLEAN.EXE, Windows-based application to be used on
Microsoft Mail 3.0 and later postoffices to purge mail from mail message
files (MMFs).
<P>
For complete information about obtaining and installing MMFCLEAN.EXE, see
the following sections:

<UL><LI>To download the utility
<LI>To install MMFCLEAN.EXE
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Currently, there is no way for an administrator to monitor or manage
space consumed by a Windows or OS/2 Mail user on a version 3.0 or
later Microsoft Mail postoffice (PO). In versions of Microsoft Mail
earlier than version 3.0, the administrator could purge mail messages
for all users on the PO. When the mail message file (MMF) architecture
of versions 3.0 and later of Microsoft Mail for Windows was introduced,
the administrator lost the ability to purge mail messages stored in the
MMFs.
<P>
The MMFCLEAN utility is a Windows-based application to be used on Microsoft
Mail 3.0 and later postoffices to purge mail from MMFs. MMFs usually exist
on the PO and contain the users' private mail messages and folders. There
is one MMF per Windows user on the PO. By default, the Windows user will
have his or her MMF file stored on the PO, but the user can choose to store
the MMF file on his or her local machine. The MMFCLEAN utility matches the
capability of the Mail Administrator program. The administrator should run
it from a Windows 3.0 or 3.1, or Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or 3.11 local
area network (LAN) client connected to the PO over the network.
<P>
You can use the MMFCLEAN utility to clean the MMF according to the
following criteria:

<UL><LI>Message Age days

<LI>All messages with size greater than XXX

<LI>Message priority
<P>
</UL><h3>Things to Note Before Running MMFCLEAN</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   WARNING: Before you use the MMFCLEAN utility to clean the database,
   make an additional backup copy of your Microsoft Mail postoffice. If
   an error occurs during a fix, you can restore the backup made
   immediately before you used the MMFCLEAN utility. In all other
   circumstances, you should restore the database from your most recent
   regularly scheduled backup.

</PRE><LI>Available disk space should be three times the size of the largest
   MMF.

<LI>Do not use an active PO; all users should be logged off and the PO
   should be backed up.

<LI>File Scan is required for Novell networks.

<LI>MMFs not stored on the PO will not be included; any MMFs stored on a
   user's local drive or on another server will not be cleaned.

<LI>No other Mail application should be running on the workstation when
   you start the MMFCLEAN utility.

<LI>The Just Compress check box in the Criteria dialog box overrides all
   other criteria. Remember that when a cleaning is done, a compress is
   also automatically done.
<P>
   Important: When MMFCLEAN does comparisons on the aging date, the
   creation date of the message is used instead of the date the user
   received the message. This means that if a user was on vacation for
   a week and then came in and downloaded his new messages to his MMF,
   the user's message could get deleted right after it is read if the
   criteria for MMFCLEAN is Read Mail Greater Than 7 Days. We are
   currently investigating how to change this limitation.

<OL><P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      mkdir &lt;drive&gt;:\mmfclean

</PRE><h3>Running MMFCLEAN in Batch Mode</h3>
 
<P>
To run the MMFCLEAN utility from an MS-DOS batch file, you need the
VMB.386, WX.EXE, and WXSRVR.EXE utilities located with this utility. Copy
VMB.386 to your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, and copy WX.EXE and WXSRVR.EXE
to your Windows directory. Additionally, you need to add the VMB.386 file
to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   [386Enh]
   Device=vmb.386

</PRE>The VMB.386 file will allow you to run a Windows-based application from
the MS-DOS prompt.
<P>
WXSRVR.EXE is a Windows-based application that should be run from File
Manager or Program Manager first. WX.EXE is an MS-DOS-based application
that is run from the MS-DOS command prompt under Windows.
<P>
Usage: wx [options] program [command-line options]

<PRE>Options                   | Description
