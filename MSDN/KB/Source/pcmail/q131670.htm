The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0a, 3.2, and 3.2a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run versions 3.0a, 3.2, and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
Administrators program (ADMIN.EXE), you may receive the following MS-DOS
message:
<P>
<PRE>   ADMIN is already running on this Post Office.
   Mailbox name:  Admin
   Full name:  Administrator
   FLAG.GLB is locked open

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
ADMIN.EXE requires write privileges to the FLAG.GLB file in \MAILDATA\GLB
sub-directory on the postoffice.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are several steps to try to resolve the problem.

<UL><LI>Make sure that no other Mail Administrator is using the
   ADMIN.EXE utility.

<LI>Make sure that the FLAG.GLB file is not locked, open, or Read-Only.

<LI>If the FLAG.GLB is not available, ADMIN.EXE will create the file.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The purpose of the FLAG.GLB file is to let other utilities (ADMIN.EXE,
IMPORT.EXE, and EXTERNAL.EXE) know the mail database is in use.
<P>
Depending on the network operating system, there are several ways to check
to see who has the file locked open:

<UL><LI>Novell NetWare versions 3.11 and 3.12: RCONSOLE and MONITOR can
   pinpoint who has the file locked open.

<LI>Windows NT versions 3.1 and 3.5 Server or Workstation: In the Control
   Panels Server, select the In Use Button showing a list of all the
   files in use for that server with the user information associated with
   the file name.
<P>
</UL>If no users have the file locked open, in File Manager from the File menu,
choose Properties to see if the Read-Only attribute is set.
<P>
On Novell NetWare version 3.xx, the procedures for checking to see if a
file is locked open using RCONSOLE and MONITOR:

<OL><P><LI>Login to the Novell network under Supervisor.

<P><LI>Run RCONSOLE.EXE in the SYSTEM sub-directory usually located in the SYS
    volume of the server.

<P><LI>Select the server that the files are located in the Available Servers
    box, and enter the password.

<P><LI>To change to the Monitor program, press the + key on the keypad to
    switch between screens in RCONSOLE. If the + key does not work,
    type the following at the ":" prompt:
<P>
       LOAD MONITOR
<P>
    You should now be in the Monitor program box indicating Information for
    Server with the server name and another box stating Available Options.

<P><LI>From the Available Options box, select File Open/Lock Activity by
    using the down arrow keys. Press ENTER.

<P><LI>Select the volume that the files reside in and you keep going through
    the boxes until the appropriate directory is found holding that file.

<P><LI>Highlight the file, and a box stating the file name will appear.

<P><LI>Under the Conn Task  Lock Status side of the box, there will be a
    connection number.

<P><LI>Use the number from step 8, and go back to the Available Options box
    by using the ESC key (which is the main menu of Monitor), and select
    Connection Information, and go to the numbered connection.
<P>
    There you will find the connection number and the user information.

<P><LI>Highlight the connection, and press ENTER.
<P>
    There will be all the files the user is accessing.
