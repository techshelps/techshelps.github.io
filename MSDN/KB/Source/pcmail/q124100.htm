The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2
<LI>Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In order to successfully install version 3.2x of Microsoft Mail for Windows
or version 3.2x of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows over Microsoft Windows
for Workgroups version 3.11, certain Windows for Workgroups Mail files must
be deleted prior to running 3.2x of Mail for Windows or Mail Remote for
Windows SETUP.EXE.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups Mail components have a more recent internal version
stamp than version 3.2x of Mail for Windows or Mail Remote for Windows
files. The setup process is designed to check this version stamp during
installation and ensure that the most recent version of the file is
installed or remains on the disk. Since many Workgroup component files
share the same file names as Mail for Windows and Mail Remote for Windows
files, the Workgroup files remain on the disk.
<P>
In the case of upgrading a Workgroups client to the Mail for Windows, the
Workgroups Mail client components will remain and will continue to operate
when running against version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
postoffice. Additionally, Mail for Windows setup will update the Windows
for Workgroups MSMAIL.INI and enable spell checking, demonstrations, and
Apple Macintosh (MAC) file type translation tables.
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups Mail files are designed to integrate with and
support:

<OL><P><LI>Microsoft At Work Fax technology designed into Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>Unified logon/mail sign-in (the user's mail password can be cached in
   the Workgroups USERNAME.PWL file). This prevents the user from having to
   enter a password when mail is launched.

<P><LI>An Optimize Local Mail File option (enabled by selecting the Mail menu
   and choosing Options) for optimizing performance when storing the MMF
   file locally (Windows for Workgroups default) on a compressed volume
   (Doublespace, Drivespace, Stacker, etc.).
<P>
</OL>Version 3.2x of Microsoft Mail for Windows files do not have this
integration and support. This only poses a problem if the Windows for
Workgroups user needs to incorporate one or more of the Microsoft Mail
updates (Application Note updates/bug fixes) to the mail files. The mixing
of these versions is not supported. Therefore, if even one of these updates
is required, then the Windows for Workgroups client should be fully
upgraded to 3.2x of Mail for Windows.
<P>
NOTE: This will result in the loss of At Work Fax and unified logins.
Special considerations will need to be addressed if the Workgroups user has
selected the Doublespace option.
<P>
In summary, either the Windows for Workgroups machine must maintain the
full set of Windows for Workgroups Mail specific files (listed below), or
the files should be deleted prior to running 3.2x of Mail for Windows
setup. This will update the required files for Mail for Windows.
<P>
To update the Windows for Workgroups Mail client to version 3.2x of Mail
for Windows:
<P>
NOTE: If Windows for Workgroups files must be replaced with Mail for
Windows files, the following procedure should be performed for all Windows
for Workgroups client machines prior to deleting the Windows for Workgroups
Mail files.

<OL><P><LI>If At Work Fax has been enabled, it should be disabled by opening the
   Control Panel, and selecting Fax, Remove.

<P><LI>Sign-in to Mail. Check that the Optimize Local Mail File is set to
   Highest Security. Select OK.
<P>
   (If the options are grayed out, this indicates that the user's MMF is
   stored on the postoffice, not locally). Alternatively, the user could
   move the MMF to the postoffice by selecting the Mail menu and choosing
   Options, Server, and then selecting the Postoffice option under Storage.

<P><LI>(Optional) If the users have adequate disk space available, consider
   having them Export All Folders in their MMF (select the File menu and
   choose, Export folder...). This creates a transportable backup of the
   MMF.

<P><LI>Exit and Sign Out of Mail. Exit Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
</OL>Delete the Windows for Workgroups Mail files listed below, prior to running
3.2x of Mail Remote for Windows SETUP.EXE.
<P>
NOTE: The files prefaced with * are Mail specific files that load when
MSMAIL.EXE is launched. Files prefaced with # are files that are Mail
specific, but are called when some menu item within mail is selected. Both
the \WINDOWS and the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectories should be checked for
copies of these files. MSMAIL.EXE and MSMAIL.HLP may reside elsewhere on
the disk as well.

</PRE></OL><h3>Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
Mail Remote for Windows will not function properly when installed into a
standard Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 installation (due to file
version stamps). If only Remote Mail functionality is desired, then the
above procedure should be performed prior to running Remote Mail's
SETUP.EXE. If both LAN-based Mail (full 3.2x Mail for Windows) and Mail
Remote for Windows functionality is desired (switched through the Mail
Selector Icon), then:

<OL><P><LI>Execute the above procedures.

<P><LI>Run version 3.2x of Mail for Windows SETUP.EXE.

<P><LI>Run Mail Remote for Windows SETUP.EXE.
