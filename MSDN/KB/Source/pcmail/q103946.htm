The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides a replacement for the MSRMTUI.DLL that is included with
version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.
<P>
For complete information about obtaining and installing the MSRMTUI.DLL
file, see the following sections:

<UL><LI>To download the updated file
<LI>To update your MSRMTUI.DLL file
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This update contains MSRMTUI.DLL, a replacement for the MSRMTUI.DLL file
that is included with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.
This replacement file provides additional enhancements to the original
MSRMTUI.DLL file that resolve the following problems:

<UL><LI>The address list becomes corrupted when it is updated twice in the
   same session of Mail Remote for Windows.

<LI>If the user forgets his or her password or if the password is
   changed while the remote driver is in use, the password cannot be
   reset.
<P>
   NOTE: To resolve this problem, two files must be updated: the
   MSRMTUI.DLL file (included in this update) and the ADMIN.EXE
   file provided in the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks version 3.2a
   Update. For details on this procedure please see the "To reset the
   password for a Mail Remote for Windows user" section below.

<LI>Invalid extended information may be displayed when you are
   obtaining details on a user from the Global Address List. The
   invalid information consists of default template fields associated
   with a postoffice other than the one on which the user's account
   resides. This condition can occur if customized user template *.TPL
   files are present on the remote user's workstation. Another
   possible symptom of this condition is receiving one of these
   messages when you are obtaining details on users from the GAL: "A
   GLB file on your server is corrupt" or "Address is no longer
   valid." The updated MSRMTUI.DLL file (included in this update)
   will prevent the customized user template *.TPL files from
   being copied to the remote user's workstation.
<P>
   NOTE: To remove the customized user template *.TPL files from an
   existing installation of Mail Remote for Windows, the user must
   first follow the "To replace your MSRMTUI.DLL file" procedure
   outlined below to install the updated MSRMTUI.DLL file, and then
   follow one of the procedures outlined in the "To update your address
   lists" section to obtain new address lists from the postoffice.

<LI>A message remaining in the Outbox could be misdirected if the remote
   address book was updated without uploading messages. The client will
   now check for the outbound messages prior to updating the address book.
   To ensure this fix works correctly, the following DLLs must be upgraded
   in conjunction with this DLL:
<P>
<PRE>      MSRMT.DLL    version 3.2.4013
      MSRMTCN.DLL  version 3.2.4013
      MSRMTSU.DLL  version 3.2.4013
      MSRMTTR.DLL  version 3.2.4013

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online
               Services

</PRE>After you download MSRMTUI.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing
"msrmtui" at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of the file.
You should receive the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   MSRMTUI.DLL    (165,136 bytes, dated 06-15-95, 6:36 P.M.)
   README.TXT

</PRE><h3>To replace your MSRMTUI.DLL file</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;path&gt;:\msrmtui.dll &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
   extracting MSRMTUI.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and
   directory where your MSRMTUI.DLL file currently resides. For example,
   if you ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on
   drive D, and your MSRMTUI.DLL file is located in the Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory on drive C, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy d:\test\msrmtui.dll c:\windows\system
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>To update your address lists</h3>
 
<P>
Perform one of these procedures if you want to remove the customized
user template *.TPL files from an existing installation of Mail Remote
for Windows:

<UL><LI>Update the address lists by using a modem connection to the

<P>
   1. From the View menu, choose Connect Now.
<P>
   2. Select the Update Address Lists option.
<P>
   3. Choose the OK button.

<LI>Update the address lists by using a LAN connection to the
   postoffice and the Mail System Selector:
<P>
   1. Obtain a network connection to the postoffice and edit the
<P><PRE>      [Microsoft Mail] section of your MSMAIL.INI file to add a
      ServerPath= line with the actual location of the Mail data
      files.
</PRE><P>
   2. With the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks driver current, exit and
<P><PRE>      sign out of Mail.
</PRE><P>
   3. Use the Microsoft Mail System Selector to switch from the
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Mail for PC Networks driver to the Mail Remote driver.
      The Mail Remote dialog box appears.
</PRE><P>
   4. To copy the address lists from the postoffice to your remote
<P><PRE>      computer, select the Copy Address List From Postoffice option.
</PRE><P>
   5. Choose the OK button.

<LI>Update the address lists by using a new data disk:
<P>
   1. Obtain a new data disk from the Mail Administrator.
<P>
   2. Copy the files from the new data disk to the
<P><PRE>      &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;Windows_dir&gt;\MSMAIL\MSRMT\USERINFO subdirectory.
</PRE><P>

<P>
</UL><h3>To reset the password for a Mail Remote for Windows user</h3>

Have the user do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Connect to the network on which his or her postoffice resides.
