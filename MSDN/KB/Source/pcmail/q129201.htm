</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install the OS/2 version 1.3 system software (included with the
Mail Multitasking version 3.2), and you encounter an error, the most likely
cause is a system or hardware problem.
<P>
Below are three examples of the most common errors, along with their causes
and solutions.

<OL><P><LI>SYS1733 error
<P>
   This error message may be displayed during installation. A SYS1733
   occurs because the country information file A:\COUNTRY.SYS is
   incorrect; the system has stopped.
<P>
   This error explanation is likely misleading as it rarely explains
   the cause.
<P>
   See the Cause section below for likely reasons for this error.

<P><LI>Fdisk Unsuccessful or Cannot Locate Fixed Disk Drive errors
<P>
   One or both of these errors occur when the hard drive and/or
   adapter require a .BID file not included on the Installation
   disks A and B.

<P><LI>Looping on reboot after installation
<P>
   After you install OS/2 and reboot your system, the computer reboots in
   an infinite loop until you insert a bootable floppy.
<P>
</OL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>SYS1733 error
<P>
   The error stems from a hardware configuration problem. Known causes are:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Misconfigured CMOS for the floppy disk drives.
    - Missing one of two floppy disk drives, but CMOS states both exist.
    - Incorrect SCSI configurations.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Fdisk Unsuccessful or Cannot Locate Fixed Disk
<P>
   The installation requires a special .BID file not included with the
   OS/2 installation disks A and B. A BID file is a Layered Device Driver
   Architecture (LADDR) driver for hard drives and adapters. Some PC
   computer hardware manufacturers require a proprietary .BID file.

<P><LI>Looping on reboot after installation
<P>
   The most likely cause is selecting the wrong mouse driver during the
   installation process.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> SYS1733 error
<P>
   To see if your CMOS is configured incorrectly, check your computer's
   BIOS setup parameters and verify they match the drives physically
   installed. To see if you have a misconfigured SCSI adapter card check
   the card's settings against the documented settings in the adapter's
   installation manual.

<P><LI>Fdisk Unsuccessful or Cannot Locate Fixed Disk errors
<P>
   To resolve the error and complete installation, try the following steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If you used Installation Disk A to boot the PC, try Installation
      Disk B and vice versa. This will insure that all .BID files have
      been tried and tested.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Contact the disk adapter manufacturer and request a .BID file for the
      adapter model. Once the .BID file is obtained you must:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      a. Make a copy of your Installation disk A
      b. Delete all the .BID files on the disk A copy
      c. Copy the new .BID file to the disk A copy
      d. Rename the new file to BOOTBID.BID.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Reboot the computer with the newly modified Installation disk
      and proceed with installing OS/2.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Looping on reboot after installation
<P>
   Reboot OS/2 using the Installation disk and select the appropriate
   mouse driver for your configuration. If the problem persists, edit
   the CONFIG.SYS and remark out the suspect mouse driver as shown:
<P>
<P><PRE>      rem DEVICE=C:\OS2\MOUSE.SYS TYPE MSSER$
</PRE><P>
   Reboot the OS/2 computer.
<P>
