The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
With versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks,
when you create a new user using the Mail Administrator program
(ADMIN.EXE), the following error message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Notice 58 Postoffice address list already has an alias with this name

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur for one or more of the following reasons:

<OL><P><LI>One or more of the following files is locked open, marked as Read Only,
   or (with Novell networks) ownerless:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ACCESS.GLB
      ACCESS2.GLB
      ACCESS3.GLB
      ADMIN.NME
      ADMINSHD.NME
      ADMIN.INF
      ADMIN.TPL
</PRE><P>
   The ADMIN.INF and ADMIN.TPL files will only be present if a template has
   been defined. By default, these files are not present.

<P><LI>One or more files on the Microsoft Mail postoffice is corrupt. You can
   determine major corruption of files by checking the file sizes.
<P>
   If any of the following calculations results in a remainder, the
   corresponding file is corrupt:
<P>
<PRE>      (size of ACCESS.GLB)   / 586
      (size of ACCESS2.GLB)  / 69
      (size of ACCESS3.GLB)  / 512
      (size of ADMIN.NME)    / 45
      (size of ADMINSHD.NME) / 45

</PRE><P><LI>The alias being added exists in the postoffice address list but not in
   the access files (ACCESS*.GLB), which contain user information.
<P>
   You can verify this situation using the ADMIN.EXE program by selecting
   Local-Admin, Modify. This should display the list of all users defined
   in the three access files. Selecting Local-Admin, Group, Create displays
   the postoffice address list.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are corresponding workarounds for the above causes. These
steps are geared for the Mail administrator:

<OL><P><LI>If you find any of the files to be marked read only, use the MS-DOS
   ATTRIB command to change the attribute on the file to read-write.
<P>
   If any of the above files are locked open on the server, close the
   files. The easiest way to do this is to reboot the server. If rebooting
   the server is not feasible, the network operating system should provide
   a means of closing files left open on the server.
<P>
   On a Novell network, if any of the above files are ownerless, use the
   Novell FILER command to assign ownership of the file to SUPERVISOR.

<P><LI>If you find a corrupted file, please contact Microsoft Product Support
   Services.
<P>
   NOTE: Restoring files from backup may have negative repercussions.

<P><LI>If the user alias is present in the Postoffice Address List (POL) but
   not in the access files, copy the POL to the Personal Address List
   (PAL), delete the user, and then copy the PAL over the POL.
<P>
   The following procedure assumes that the administrator mailbox still
   exists and the 8-digit hexadecimal ID (hexid) is 00000000. If you are
   using an account other than 00000000, substitute the 8-digit hexid of
   that account for 00000000.
<P>
   a. Obtain the user's mailbox name. From the Administrator program Config
<P><PRE>      menu, choose Password. Note the postoffice and network names.
</PRE><P>
   b. At the MS-DOS command prompt, change to the NME subdirectory of the
<P><PRE>      Mail database.
</PRE><P>
   c. Make a backup of the POL by typing the following command:
<P>
<PRE>         copy admin.nme admin.old

   d. Make a backup of your PAL by typing the following command:

         copy 00000000.nme 00000000.old

      If 00000000.NME is a zero-byte file, copying may not work. You can
      safely skip this step.

   e. Copy the POL to the PAL by typing the following command:

         copy admin.nme 00000000.nme

   f. Move up one directory level from the NME subdirectory (by typing
      CD..).

   g. Start the MS-DOS Mail client and sign in using the admin mailbox by
      typing the following command:

         mail admin -p&lt;password&gt;

   h. From the Address menu, choose Delete. (If you have the version 2.1e
      MS-DOS client, choose Remove from the Address menu.) This should
      bring up a list of users. Select the user you want to delete and
      press the ENTER key. You will now be prompted for confirmation to
      delete the user. Press the ENTER key again.

   i. Quit out of the Mail client.

   j. At the MS-DOS command prompt, change to the NME directory of the Mail
      database.

   k. Copy the PAL to the POL by typing the following command:

         copy 00000000.nme admin.nme
         copy 00000000.nme adminshd.nme

   l. Move up one directory level from the NME subdirectory (by typing
      CD..).

   m. Start the Administrator program. You should now be able to add the
      problem user account.

   Once you have successfully added the user account, delete the ADMIN.OLD
   file and copy 00000000.OLD to 00000000.NME. (If you skipped step D
   above, you do not need to copy 00000000.OLD to 00000000.NME.)
