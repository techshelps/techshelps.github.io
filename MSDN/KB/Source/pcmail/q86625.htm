The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
With version 2.1 or 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when you delete
an externally defined postoffice with the Mail Administrator program
(ADMIN.EXE), the following error may occur:
<P>
<PRE>   Notice 53
   This Post office is a hub for other post offices.

</PRE>This error will occur when the internal counter of indirect postoffice
connections is greater than 0 (zero). This value is stored with the
external postoffice configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two probable reasons this error will occur when trying to
delete a postoffice:

<OL><P><LI>This postoffice is a hub for postoffice(s). This can be confirmed
   by creating a report from the ADMIN.EXE program. From the main
   menu, select External Admin, Report, Setup, All Post Offices, then
   print either to a printer or to a file. This file will show whether
   any of the externally defined postoffices are linked via indirect.
   These links need to be removed before the hub postoffice can be
   deleted or modified.

<P><LI>The .XTN file has a bad value in the internal counter for indirect
   postoffices. The .XTN file will be preceded by an eight-digit
   hexadecimal number such as 000000AB.XTN. The file must be manually
   corrected using the following process:
<P>
   a. Obtain the network and postoffice names of the suspected
<P><PRE>      postoffice.
</PRE><P>
   b. Type out the NETWORK.GLB file that is located within the GLB
<P><PRE>      directory of the postoffice. This file is not encrypted and is
      not formatted.
</PRE><P>
   c. Look for the network name of the problem postoffice and write
<P><PRE>      down the eight-digit number that follows it. This is the ID of
      this network's associated .XTN file. Make two copies of this
      file (for example, XXXXXXXX.BAK and XXXXXXXX.TMP).
</PRE><P>
   d. Use DEBUG on the .TMP file to find the affected postoffice and
<P><PRE>      zero the indirect PO counter.
</PRE><P>
   The first defined postoffice name will appear at byte offset 101,
   and the associated location of the indirect postoffice counter will
   be at 389. These values are offset by 2BAh and 698 (decimal).
<P>
   The following chart details the first 20 possible file positions
   for postoffice names, the associated delete bit, and indirect PO
   counter locations.
<P>
<PRE>      Delete Bit   Postoffice Name   Indirect PO Counter

        100            101                 389

        21B8           21B9                2441
        2472           2473                26FB
        272C           272D                29B5
        29E6           29E7                2C6F
        2CA0           2CA1                2F29
        2F5A           2F5B                31E3
        3214           3215                349D
        34CE           34CF                3757

   e. Open the temporary XXXXXXXX.TMP file in DEBUG. (Note: The DEBUG
      command prompt is a hyphen). For example, type:

         debug 00000009.tmp

   f. At the hyphen (-) prompt, type D100 and press ENTER to get the
      name of the first postoffice in the file preceded by a one-byte
      delete code. If the delete code is 01 and the postoffice name is
      the one you want, you are viewing the correct record and you
      should go to step g.

      If the postoffice name is not correct or the delete code is 00
      (indicating a previously deleted record), repeat step f using
      the next row in the table (-D3BA, -D674, -D92E, and so on) until
      you find the affected record.

   g. Once you have found the affected postoffice record, type in Exxx
      of the associated value in the Indirect PO Counter column above.
      This value will be greater than 00 and will need to be reset. For
      example:

         -E389
         xxxx:0389  01.

   h. After the period (.), type in 00 00 (zero zero space zero zero)
      and press ENTER. This will null bytes 389H and 38AH, which hold
      the indirect postoffice count. Now press W, ENTER (write to
      disk) and Q, ENTER, to quit DEBUG.

   i. Copy the debugged XXXXXXXX.TMP file over the XXXXXXXX.XTN file.
      Then use the ADMIN.EXE program to delete the external postoffice
      definition.

      NOTE: If something went wrong and this didn't work, copy your
      XXXXXXXX.BAK file over your new XXXXXXXX.XTN file to restore it
      to its previous state.
