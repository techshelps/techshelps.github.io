<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0 and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Version 3.0b of Microsoft Mail for Windows does not check for sufficient
disk space when it exports folders. If there is insufficient disk space,
the export will end without notifying the user that it ran out of disk
space during the export. The exported folder file can be used later for
importing; however, it will only include the folders it was able to create
before running out of disk space. The last folder exported may not contain
all of the mail messages. Furthermore, the last mail message written into
the exported folder may be corrupt, which can result in the following error
message while you attempt to import the last folder into another mail
message file (MMF):
<P>
<PRE>   Application Error

   MAILSPL caused a General Protection Fault in module DEMILAYR.DLL at
   0013:0385

</PRE>You can select the Close button to end the Mail program and you then must
restart Windows before you can run Mail again from that computer. The MMF
you imported the folders to may now be corrupt.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use version 3.0b of the Windows client to repair the corrupted MMF
by holding down the SHIFT key while you click the OK button (or press
ENTER) after you type the mailbox name and password.
<P>
Microsoft Mail may not be successful in repairing the corrupt MMF. You may
still be able to repair the MMF by deleting the corrupted message from the
MMF; however, to do so, you may have to delete all messages in the folder
that was created last during the export.
<P>
If there was not enough space on the disk to export all of the folders
successfully, you should not attempt to import the last folder you
exported.
