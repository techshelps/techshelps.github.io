The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows is supported over a Remote Access
Service (RAS), although it will be much slower than if you access mail
directly over a network. (Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows
provides faster access.) If you need to use Mail for Windows over RAS, you
should compose and read messages offline.
<P>
<P><h3>To start Mail offline</h3>
 
<P>
To start Mail offline, double-click the MMF file referred to in the
OfflineMessages line of the MSMAIL.INI file (located in the Windows
subdirectory).
<P>
NOTE: With the Microsoft Mail for Windows NT, MSMAIL32.EXE, the command
line option will work. However, if you double-click on the MMF in File
Manager, the wrong name appears for the Mailbox only after trying to find
the postoffice. If you are on the network, this should not take long. If
you are using RAS, as this article indicates, this may take several
minutes.
<P>
Another method is to create a second icon for offline Mail by copying the
Mail icon and changing the properties to include /f &lt;MMF name&gt;. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>   c:\msmail\msmail.exe /f myname.mmf

</PRE>You can compose messages while working offline. Only the Personal Address
Book (PAB) will be available while you work offline. To send and receive
messages, exit and sign out and then double-click the (online) Mail icon to
start Mail.
<P>
<P><h3>To improve performance</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Move the mail message file (MMF) to your local computer. You can do this
   from the Windows client by choosing Options from the Mail menu, then
   choosing Server. Moving the MMF to your local machine requires SHARE.EXE
   to be loaded on the machine. When the MMF is local, you are responsible
   for making regular and frequent backups.

<P><LI>If the Global Address List (GAL) is available at the postoffice, use
   GALOnly=1 option in the MSMAIL section of the MSMAIL.INI file. If this
   entry is set to 1, the Mail address book will display only the GAL and
   the PAB. If this entry is set to 0, the Mail address book will display
   all possible address lists and the PAB.

<P><LI>Turn AutoCompress off by using No_Compress=1 in the MMF section of the
   MSMAIL.INI file. This will disable background compression of the message
   store. You can compress your MMF when you are working offline by holding
   down the F5 key while you log in to Mail.

<P><LI>Turn off Inbox Shadowing if you do not use other Mail clients such as
   the MS-DOS or Remote client to read your mail. You can do this from the
   Windows client by choosing Options from the Mail menu, choosing Server,
   and checking the Keep Copy Of Inbox For Dialin Access option.

<P><LI>Keep the number of messages in the Inbox to a minimum.

<P><LI>Perform any message manipulation, such as moving a message to a
   different folder or deleting a message, while you are working offline.

<P><LI>Turn off the option to empty the wastebasket on exit by choosing Options
   from the Mail menu and unchecking the Empty Wastebasket When Exiting
   option. To empty the Wastebasket when you are working offline, select
   the Wastebasket folder, select the first message and press
   CTRL+SHIFT+END to highlight all the messages, and then press the DELETE
   key.
