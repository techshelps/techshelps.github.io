<P>
Below is a list of frequently asked questions and the answers about
implementing mail and scheduling products using the Microsoft Windows 95
operating system.

<PRE> 1. Q. Will the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client transfer mail
       with a version 3.x Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice?

    A. Yes. The Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client can install the
       Microsoft Mail service provider. When this provider is installed,
       the Microsoft Exchange client can access either a Microsoft Windows
       for Workgroups postoffice (WGPO) or a version 3.x of Microsoft Mail
       for PC Networks postoffice.

 2. Q. Does the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client handle remote
       mail transfer?

    A. Yes. The Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client using the
       Microsoft Mail service provider supports remote mail
       functionality, including remote header preview, selective
       message downloading, scheduled mail transfers, local address
       list download/update, and options for maximizing remote session
       performance. However, Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client uses
       a different method of connecting to the postoffice than the
       proprietary mechanism used by Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.

       Microsoft Exchange connects, logs into, and gets validated on a
       local area network (LAN) using a Dialup Networking connection to
       a Microsoft Windows NT or Microsoft Windows 95 Remote Access
       Service server, a Shiva LanRover, or Novell NetWare Connect remote
       networking software. The Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client
       cannot dial into the version 3.x of the External Mail program
       (EXTERNAL.EXE) to transfer mail with a postoffice.

       For technical information about Windows NT Server's Remote Access
       Service, please review the following document:

           ftp.microsoft.com/data/bussys/winnt/winnt-
           docs/papers/raspaper.doc (or zip).

 3. Q. Does the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client handle remote
       mail transfer to postoffices on Novell servers?

    A. Yes. Assuming the following:

       - A valid remote networking session with the LAN can be
         established (using one of the connection options mentioned
         above).

       - The remote Windows 95 workstation is configured to use the
         Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks.

       - The Microsoft IPX/SPX compatible protocol is bound to the
         Dial-Up Adapter.

       - The Novell Network performs bindery-based security
         authentication.

 4. Q. What should be considered prior to upgrading an existing Microsoft
       Mail for PC Networks clients to the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95
       client?

    A. Prior to installing the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, the
       following should be considered:

       - Postoffice (PO) pathing. If you access the postoffice via a
         drive letter, ensure that the drive letter is mapped correctly,
         and that the PO is accessible within Windows 95 prior to
         installing the Microsoft Exchange client. When the Microsoft
         Exchange Setup Wizard prompts you for the path to the PO, specify
         the correct drive letter and path.

         Because Windows 95 supports universal naming convention (UNC)
         pathing to network resources, UNC is the preferred method.
         This is now supported to NetWare resources when you use the 32-
         bit, protect-mode Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks
         redirector.

         The following are examples of UNC syntax to a NetWare resource:

            \\&lt;servername&gt;\&lt;volumename&gt;\&lt;path&gt;

            \\NW5_HQ\SYS\MAILDATA

         UNC pathing will not work for NetWare resources if NETX or VLM
         is the installed redirector for NetWare networks.

         - Postoffice account exists. You should already have a valid
           account on the PO. After you specify the path to the PO, the
           Setup Wizard will present a list of user accounts from the
           PO (assuming the PO is accessible at that time). You will
           need to select your account from the list and supply the
           correct password.

         - If a list is not presented, this indicates that the PO was not
           accessible at the time. You can continue configuring Microsoft
           Exchange by entering the information manually, or cancel the
           configuration Wizard and retry at a later time.

         - Location of the PST and PAB. The Microsoft Exchange client's
           equivalent to the mail message file (MMF) is a
           &lt;filename&gt;.PST file [Personal Folders]. The MMF contained
           the Personal Address Book (PAB). Microsoft Exchange now
           stores this list in a separate file, &lt;filename&gt;.PAB [Personal
           Address Book]. The Setup Wizard creates these files wherever
           the user specifies. Generally, it is recommended that the PAB
           and PST be stored on the local workstation. Optionally the PST
           could be stored under the PO database's \MMF subdirectory, or
           other network share.

         NOTE: The Microsoft Exchange client user interface (UI) does not
         provide the functionality to move the PST file.

         - MMF location for conversion. Microsoft Exchange Setup Wizard
           looks in the MSMAIL.INI [Microsoft Mail] section for the entry
           OfflineMessages=&lt;path&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;.MMF. If the Setup program
           finds this entry, and the MMF file exists, the Wizard
           will present a page for converting the contents of the
           MMF into the PST and PAB files previously specified. If the
           MMF is stored on the PO database, this INI entry will not
           exist, and the Wizard will not present the converter page.

         NOTE: The migration process does not alter the MMF, it only
         reads information from it. Also, any MMF can be migrated at a
         later time by choosing Import from the File menu. The password
         of the MMF is required for migration.

         - Strategies for migrating MMFs. Ideally the MMF is moved local
           prior to installing the Exchange client. The integrity of
           the MMF is verified by running the CHECKMMF process.

           Notes:

           - The local hard drive should have 3 times the file size of
             the MMF available.

           - The migration utility can process a file across the network,
             but local is faster and exposure to network problems are
             minimized.

           - It is not recommended that the Mail user leave his or her
             MMF in the \MMF subdirectory on the PO server, because
             the file name is an 8 digit &lt;hex-number&gt;.MMF. To determine
             an user's hex-id on the PO requires special techniques or
             utilities. This will quickly prove time consuming and
             inefficient when you upgrade users to the Microsoft
             Exchange client.

         - Shared folders. The Microsoft Mail service provider that
           ships with Windows 95 does not support accessing Shared
           Folders on a version 3.x Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
           postoffice or a Microsoft Windows for Workgroups postoffice
           (WGPO). An updated Microsoft Mail service provider
           (EXUPDUSA.EXE) supporting Shared Folders is available for
           download.

           Large installations that use Shared Folders will want to
           apply this update to the distribution share point prior
           to the rollout of Exchange client.

         - Spell checking. Windows 95 Exchange client requires access
           to a Win32 application's spell checker. It does not install
           its own spell checker. Microsoft Office 95 and Microsoft
           Office for Windows NT include a Win32 spell checker. Other
           third party Win95 applications will likely include options
           for installing a spell checker into Windows 95.

         - Schedule+ version. Please review the questions regarding
           Schedule+ later in this document.

         - Microsoft Mail Advanced Security. The Exchange client does
           not engage Advanced Security (reading an encrypted UNC path
           embedded in a MAIL.DAT file at launch). You are required to
           specify the path to the PO in the Profile Setup Wizard during
           Microsoft Exchange installation.

 5. Q. Can the existing version 3.x Microsoft Mail for PC Networks client
       software continue to run under Windows 95?

    A. Yes. The current Microsoft Mail clients, such as Microsoft Mail and
       Microsoft Mail Remote, are fully supported running under
       Windows 95. However, the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client
       offers a more feature rich, unified user interface that is
       capable of connecting to a variety of additional services.

 6. Q. When you upgrade an existing Windows 3.x or Windows for
       Workgroups (WFW) 3.x workstations to Windows 95, are there
       any special considerations for maintaining existing version 3.x
       Microsoft Mail for PC Networks mail configurations?

    A. With the exception of the loss of WFW At Work Fax capabilities, no.
       This assumes that no Microsoft Exchange components are selected for
       installation during setup. The network administrators should
       consider how the path to the postoffice is currently established
       (login script drive mapping, batch file mapping, persistent
       connection, etc.), and confirm that the current method is
       valid under Windows 95 networking. Otherwise, the version 3.x of
       Microsoft Mail for PC Networks client may report that it
       cannot find the postoffice when you run it.

       If any Exchange component is installed, then these component(s)
       may need to be removed by using the Control Panel, Add/Remove
       Programs, Windows Setup. The previous Microsoft Mail for PC
       Networks client software may also require reinstallation.

       For information on options for "scripting" and controlling Windows
       95 installation options, refer to the "Deployment Planning Guide
       Installation" and "Appendix - MSBATCH.INF parameters" sections of
       the Windows 95 Resource Kit help file. This help file can be
       found on the Windows 95 CD at \ADMIN\RESKIT\HELPFILE\WIN95RK.HLP.

 7. Q. What components are common to version 3.x of Microsoft Mail for
       PC Networks clients and the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client?

    A. Two files have the same file names between Microsoft Mail for
       PC Networks clients and Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client:
       MSMAIL.INI and MAPI.DLL. When the Microsoft Exchange client
       components are installed, the Setup program installs the Microsoft
       Exchange MAPI.DLL into the &lt;windir&gt;\SYSTEM subdirectory,
       overwriting any existing MAPI.DLL.

       Additionally, Setup may migrate certain MSMAIL.INI entries into
       the registry, MSMAIL32.INI or EXCHNG32.INI files. Setup should
       leave the MSMAIL.INI intact for backwards compatibility with
       16-bit, mail-aware (for example, messaging application programming
       interface (MAPI)) Windows applications.

 8. Q. Can the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, Microsoft Mail
       3.2, and/or Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows be used at the
       same time?

    A. This configuration is not supported. Either the version 3.x
       Microsoft Mail for PC Networks set of clients or the Microsoft
       Exchange Windows 95 client can be functional under Windows 95,
       but not both.

       If you do run both, it could result in file contention issues,
       possible database corruption on the postoffice, and other
       complications for remote mail users and mail aware applications.

 9. Q. Will version 1.0 of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows function if
       the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client is installed?

    A. You can still use Schedule+ 1.0 if you have migrated to the
       Microsoft Exchange client, but the functionality will be
       diminished. You will be able to use Schedule+ in standalone
       (off-line) mode, but you will not have the ability to send or
       receive meeting requests.

       For more information, see the Windows 95 EXCHANGE.TXT file.

10. Q. Will Schedule+ 1.0 continue to function normally if the 3.x
       Microsoft Mail components remain the installed mail components
       in Windows 95?

    A. Yes.

11. Q. Does version 7.0 of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows 95 require
       Windows 95 Exchange components?

    A. Yes. Schedule+ 7.0 relies on an enhanced messaging API set
       known as Extended MAPI. Only Microsoft Exchange components provide
       this API set. Version 3.x of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
       supports only simple MAPI.

12. Q. Can Schedule+ 1.0 and Schedule+ 7.0 users share the same Windows
       for Workgroups postoffice (WGPO) or version 3.x Microsoft Mail
       for PC Networks version postoffice?

    A. Yes.

       Notes:

        - See the Microsoft Office 95 \Schedule\SCREADME.TXT file.

        - Schedule+ 7.0 requires the Microsoft Exchange Windows client
          to send and receive meeting requests.

        - Schedule+ 7.0 is backwards compatible with Schedule+ 1.0
          except that 7.0 users cannot write to Schedule+ 1.0 data files,
          and Schedule+ 1.0 users cannot read Schedule+ 7.0 data files.
          The free and busy information can still be viewed.

        - Manager/delegate pairs must use the same version of Schedule+
          (for example, both must use either Schedule+ 1.0 or Schedule+
          7.0).

        - Existing Schedule+ administrative utilities in ADMINSCH.EXE
          are supported, with the exception of the Administration/Clean
          Up Schedule Files command. This command should not be run on
          a Microsoft Mail 3.x postoffice with Schedule+ 7.0 users.

13. Q. How will resource accounts function in a mixed Schedule+
       environment?

    A. If resource accounts are upgraded to 7.0, Schedule+ 1.0 users
       will only be able to view free/busy information through the
       Planner. If the resources are upgraded to 7.0, upgrade
       the resource Assistant also.

       If resource accounts remain in 1.0 format, both Schedule+ 1.0 and
       7.0 users will be able to see the details of the resource
       (although 7.0 users only have read access.)

14. Q. Will Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer forms (E-forms) and
       16-bit MAPI applications continue to work when the Microsoft
       Exchange Windows 95 client is installed?

    A. Yes. E-forms or messaging applications that adhere to simple MAPI
       specifications should continue to function under Windows 95
       regardless of whether the system continues to use version 3.x
       Microsoft Mail for PC Networks or is upgraded to the Microsoft
       Exchange client/Microsoft Mail service provider. MAPI.DLL included
       with Microsoft Exchange supports simple MAPI.

15. Q. Will third party add-on products for version 3.x of Microsoft Mail
       for PC Networks continue to function when the Microsoft Exchange
       Windows 95 client is installed?

    A. Products that adhere to the simple MAPI specification should
       continue to function. Other products that exploit or rely on other
       version 3.x Microsoft Mail for PC Networks specific function
       calls may not function correctly under Windows 95 and may
       interfere with the Microsoft Exchange client's functionality.

       For additional information, refer to the "Troubleshooting Tips"
       section of EXCHANGE.TXT in the Windows subdirectory of Windows 95
       or contact the manufacturer of the product.

16. Q. Can a single PST and PAB file be shared between multiple Microsoft
       Exchange Windows 95 client profiles?

    A. Yes. These files can be shared between a user's multiple profiles,
       or separate files specified for each profile. A Microsoft Exchange
       client can mount multiple PST files from within a profile, but it
       can only mount one PAB within a profile. Generally, it is advised
       that users create only one PAB, and specify this PAB in all
       profiles.

17. Q. Can multiple users share the same Windows 95 workstation, use
       Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, and keep their mail
       private, separate, and secure?

    A. Yes. The Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client was designed
       to accommodate a variety of user work scenarios. There are several
       ways to address the needs mentioned above. Users can password
       protect their PST files and enable User Profiles on the local
       machine. However, Server Based Setups offer a more centralized
       approach to managing single workstation, multi-user scenarios.

       For more information, review the "Deployment Planning Guide &amp;
       Installation" section of Windows 95 Resource Kit help file.

18. Q. Can a single user roam throughout a site, work at various
       workstations, and still store all his or her mail in a single,
       secure message file?

    A. Yes. There are several ways to approach this requirement. One
       solution could be as simple as to have the user store his or her
       password protected PST and PAB file in an accessible location
       on the network. The user can create a Microsoft Exchange
       profile that specifies these files at every workstation he or she
       work from.

       However, a better solution would be to implement a Server-Based
       Setup that enables the retrieval of a much larger set of user
       desktop/configuration preferences from anywhere on the network,
       and run this configuration on the current workstation.

       For more information, review the "Deployment Planning Guide &amp;
       Installation" section of Windows 95 Resource Kit help file.

19. Q. Is the MMF conversion to PST/PAB one-way only?

    A. Yes. MMF-to-PST/PAB conversion is "one-way" only. However, the
       conversion process does not alter the MMF. This MMF could be
       restored as the active MMF to a re-installed version 3.x Microsoft
       Mail for PC Networks client. However, there is no easy
       way to retrieve new mail that has spooled into a user's PST(s)
       while Microsoft Exchange was the active mail client.

20. Q. Where can I find more information about installing and using
       the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client?

    A. The Windows 95 Resource Kit help file's "Communications,
       Electronic Mail and Microsoft Exchange" section contains
       information about installing, configuring, and using the
       Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client. This help file can be
       found on the Windows 95 CD under the \ADMIN\RESKIT\HELPFILE
       subdirectory.

       Also, context sensitive help is available from within
       the client by pressing the F1 key.

       See also the EXCHANGE.TXT file located in the Windows 95
       subdirectory.
