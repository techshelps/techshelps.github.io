<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Postoffice Diagnostics Utility,
   version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Postoffice Diagnostics Utility (PODIAG.EXE) has seven different toolbar
icons. The toolbar will appear under the menu bar if the View, Toolbar
option is selected.
<P>
Reading from left to right, the first icon is a folder being opened. This
is the Open PO icon. This icon is used to select a postoffice on which to
run the diagnostics. This icon has a menu equivalence of choosing Open
Postoffice from the File menu.
<P>
The second icon is a folder being closed. This is the Close PO icon. This
icon is used when the administrator has finished running the diagnostics on
the postoffice that was opened. This icon has a menu equivalence of
choosing Close Postoffice from the File menu.
<P>
The third icon is a single person running. This is the Run Selected Tool
icon. This icon will initially be unavailable (gray) when a postoffice is
first opened. This icon will become accessible once you select one of the
tools. Selecting this icon will bring up the preference dialog box for the
selected tool. You can then run the tool by selecting either Check or Check
&amp; Fix. You can choose not to run the tool at this point and can select
either Close or Cancel. The Close option saves the tool's preferences and
closes the preference dialog box. The Cancel option cancels the check and
does not save the tool's preferences.
<P>
The fourth icon is two people running. This is the Run All Tools Listed
icon. This icon will immediately begin running all of the tools listed
without prompting you for any further input, provided that the AutoFix=
statement in the [Microsoft Mail PO Diagnostics] section of the PODIAG.INI
file is set to "No." If AutoFix=Yes, a dialog box will appear, warning that
the postoffice must not be accessed by any programs while it is being
checked and fixed. If AutoFix=No, all of the listed tools will be run in
Check mode only.
<P>
The fifth icon is a pair of eyeglasses. This is the View Current Log File
icon. This icon displays the postoffice's PODIAG.LOG file. The default log
viewer utility is NOTEPAD.EXE. However, you can set the log viewer to
another application by setting the LogViewer= statement in the PODIAG.INI
file to something other than NOTEPAD.EXE.
<P>
The sixth icon is a star. This is the Re-Initialize Tools icon. This icon
will reset the tool information that appears once the tool has been run.
This information appears in bold letters to the right of each of the tool
definitions. Examples of the information that will be cleared from the
display are the number of warnings, number of errors, and the date and time
the tool was last run.
<P>
The seventh icon is a question mark. This icon is the Help On Selected Tool
icon. This icon brings up the Help information on the selected tool or, if
no tools are selected, it brings up general help for the utility.
