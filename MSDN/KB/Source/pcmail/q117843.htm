The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows was not designed to
support extended information (custom template information). When
RNETWORK.GLB file is created, it packages all the TPL files. INF files do
not get packaged in RNETWORK.GLB; therefore, extended information is not
available for remote users. However, there is a problem with the way the
remote client handles the extended information when it is present on the
postoffice.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail Remote for Windows. This problem was corrected in MSRMTUI.DLL version
3.2.0.4008. If you do not have version 3.2.0.4008 (or later), you can find
MSRMTUI.EXE, a self-extracting file, on the following services:

   TITLE     : Mail Remote MSRMTUI.DLL Update

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If there is an 8DIGIT.TPL file associated with an external postoffice in
the WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSRMT\TPL subdirectory, when you get details by picking
a user from the external PO list, the standard fields are displayed. But if
you get details by picking a user from the GAL, in addition to the standard
fields, the default template information is displayed (default information
from 8DIGIT .TPL). Getting details on every user on that postoffice,
results in the same template information because the information is being
read from the 8DIGIT.TPL.
<P>
The remote client does not read the INFs and so the template information
should NOT be displayed when getting details.
<P>
When RNETWORK.GLB is generated, all *.TPLs, (including 8DIGIT.TPLs for
other postoffices) are included in the file. When the remote client is
installed with this data disk, the TPLs are placed in the TPL
subdirectory in WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSRMT\TPL. On the remote client, the
external postoffices have a hexid that do not correspond with the hexid
on the postoffice.
<P>
For example, if you have EXTNET/EXTPO defined on your PO,
you may have 00000002.USR and 00000002.TPL and 00000002.INF on the PO
whereas on the remote client, you may have 00000001.USR but the TPL is
still is in 00000002.TPL. When you get details, you end up getting the
information from the wrong TPL file.
<P>
For example, on the postoffice, if you have 10 8DIGIT.TPL files associated
with 10 different external POs. RNETWORK.GLB contains all these 10
8DIGIT.TPL files. The WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSRMT\TPL directory contains these
10DIGIT.TPL files. When the information in the data disk is parsed out at
the remote client, the external POs are associated with different hexids.
When you get details on the user from the GAL, it looks at the wrong
8DIGIT.TPL file as the new hexid associations have not affected the TPLs.
<P>
A similar problem existed with ADMIN.TPL and the problem was resolved
by deleting the ADMIN.TPL file when you parse out RNETWORK.GLB. A similar
mechanism is required to delete all the 8DIGIT.TPL files at the remote
client.
