<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Postoffice Diagnostics Utility,
   version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Mail Postoffice Diagnostics Utility (PODIAG.EXE) Address &amp;
Group Check may return an Error 140 if it detects a badly corrupted
NETPO.GLB file that cannot be repaired.
<P>
One condition that will result in the Error 140 is when the NETPO.GLB file
size does not divide into an integer after performing the following
calculation:
<P>
<PRE>   [(NETPO.GLB file size) - 4]/43

</PRE>PODIAG.EXE will create a new 4-byte NETPO.GLB file with a 4-byte header.
All external postoffice addresses and PROFS or SNADS gateway addresses that
were added to the postoffice address list or personal address lists will be
invalid after the NETPO.GLB file has been reset. These invalid addresses
will be detected by the Address &amp; Group Check and will be deleted. The
following is the error message PODIAG.EXE displays when a badly corrupted
NETPO.GLB is detected:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 140 Detected a problem with file (NETPO.GLB). All information will
   be removed from this file. After this fix, run the Address and Group
   tool with the maximum depth and all detail options selected. You must
   also add the external and gateway postoffice addresses manually. Do you
   want all information removed from this file?

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is an excerpt from a PODIAG.LOG file that displays the
detection and correction of a badly corrupted NETPO.GLB. If the depth of
check is not set to the maximum allowable, the administrator must run
PODIAG.EXE again in order to detect the invalid addresses caused by the
resetting of the NETPO.GLB.
<P>
<PRE>   Error 140 Detected a problem with file (NETPO.GLB). All
     information will be removed from this file. After this
     fix, run the Address and Group tool with the maximum
     depth and all detail options selected. You must also
     add the external and gateway postoffice addresses manually.
