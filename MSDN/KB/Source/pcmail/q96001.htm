The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>Directory Synchronization Error and Status Messages #9 - 29</h2>
 
<P>
On Microsoft Mail for PC Networks version 3.0 Server Disk 1, there is a
file called DIRSYNC.TXT that contains the error codes used in directory
synchronization (Dir-Sync) and in the IMPORT utility for Mail. The errors
are logged in the DIRSYNC.LOG file.
<P>
<PRE>[9]     Out of Memory
   Ensure that you are running the program on a computer with at least
   640K of memory.

[10]    Directory Sync has not been enabled
   Ensure that your postoffice is a version 3.0 postoffice. If it is
   not, upgrade to version 3.0 before continuing.

[12]    Invalid character in column 1
   The import file has an invalid character in column 1.

   Check the file for an invalid code in column 1. The valid codes are
   A (Add), D (Delete), M (Modify), R (Replace) and T (Template file).

   Also check the file for an invalid character in column 1 following
   the line that contains the code. The line that follows Add, Delete or
   Modify codes and contains specific user template information should
   have a hyphen in column 1. Lines that follow a T code and are part of
   a template file should have a space in column 1.

[13]    Invalid transaction command
   Check the import file for an invalid code in column 1. The valid
   codes are A (Add), D (Delete), M (Modify), R (Replace), and T
   (Template file).

[14]    Error processing RESYNC.GLB
   The Import utility is temporarily unable to generate RESYNC.GLB.
   Run the Import utility again with the -S option to clear the
   problem.

[15]    Invalid character in phone number
   Check the import file for an invalid character in at least one of
   the FAX phone number fields. Valid phone number characters are
   digits, the space, the comma (,) and the hyphen (-).

[16]    Unknown address type
   Check the import file for an invalid address. See the Server
   version Administrator's Guide for the format of Microsoft Mail
   addresses and the specific gateway manual for the format of foreign
   addresses.

[17]    Unexpected end of line in node address
   Microsoft Mail type addresses (PCM, PROFS, SNADS and OV) require a
   network (or gateway name) and a postoffice (or a node or DGN)
   separated by a slash mark (/). Check the import file for at least
   one Microsoft Mail type address that is not correctly specified.

[18]    Unexpected end of line in fullname
   Check the import file for a missing address and possibly a missing
   portion of the fullname (the alias) following an Add (A), Delete
   (D) or Modify (M) code.

[19]    Unexpected end of line in physical address

   Microsoft Mail type addresses (PCM, PROFS, SNADS and OV) require a
   network name (or gateway name), a postoffice name (or a NodeID or
   DGN), and a mailbox name (or UserID or DEN) separated by slash
   marks (/). The address is preceded by an address type and a colon
   (:). The following is an example of a PROFS address:

      PROFS:VMGATE/NODE1/USER1

   Check the import file in lines containing Add (A), Delete (D) and
   Modify (M) codes for at least one Microsoft Mail type address that
   is not correctly specified.

[20]    Address element is too long
   Check the import file for Microsoft Mail type addresses (PCM,
   PROFS, SNADS and OV addresses) that have a network name (or
   gateway name), postoffice name (or NodeID or DGN) or a mailbox name
   (or UserID or DEN) that exceeds ten characters.

[21]    Input file is corrupt or has incorrect format.
   Check the import file for any lines that are not in the correct
   format.

[22]    Expecting '/' in template information line
   The import file requires a slash mark (/) to separate a template
   prompt from template information. The format of the line is:

      -prompt/information

   Check the import file for at least one missing prompt/information
   slash mark separator.

[23]    Expecting tab or space
   Check the import file for invalid characters where there should be
   a tab or a space. For example, when specifying to Add (A), Delete
   (D) or Modify (M) an address, there must either be spaces in
   columns 2 and 33, or the alias must be separated from the address
   code (A, D, or M) and the address type by tabs.

[24]    Template info not allowed for this address type
   Check the import file for template information specified for an
   address that does not support templates. The types of addresses
   that do not support templates are: MCI, X400, SMTP, MHS, MSMAIL,
   and FAX. Remove any template information that appears with
   addresses of these types.

[25]    Physical address is too long
   Check the import file for an address following an Add (A), Delete
   (D) or Modify (M) code that exceeds the size limit.

[26]    Error in physical address
   There is an error in at least one address in the import file
   following an Add (A), Delete (D) or Modify (M) code. The error is
   most likely in an MCI or FAX address. Both of these types of
   addresses have carriage returns within the address while the import
   file format requires the address to fit on one line. The solution
   is to substitute different characters for the carriage return. For
   FAX addresses in the import file, tildes (~) separate the four
   fields of the physical address. The Import utility replaces these
   with carriage returns before storing the address in the postoffice
   data files. For MCI addresses in the import file, a space
   substitutes a carriage return-linefeed. The Import utility inserts
   the required carriage return-linefeeds into the address before
   storing it in the postoffice data files.

[27]    Alias already exists
   Check the import file for aliases following an Add (A) or a Modify
   (M) code that already exists in one of the postoffice's address
   lists. All address lists except for the Global Address List must
   have unique aliases.

[28]    Duplicate alias in transaction queue
   Check the import file for duplicate aliases destined for the same
   address list in lines containing Add (A) or Modify (M) codes.

[29]    Alias does not exist
   Check the import file lines containing Delete (D) or Modify (M)
   codes for an alias that does exist.
