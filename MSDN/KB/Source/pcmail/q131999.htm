The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It may be necessary to restore a user mail account that was accidentally
deleted.
<P>
If the user was using Microsoft Mail for Windows, you can restore
the old mail message file (MMF) from backup and import it to the new
account.
<P>
If the user was using Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation,
you can use the steps below to access the old mail account:

<OL><P><LI>Restore from backup a copy of the postoffice prior to the deletion.
   Restore it to a location other than the existing postoffice location.

<P><LI>Using MOVEUSER, login to the current postoffice and the restored copy of
   the postoffice.

<P><LI>Drag and drop the user from the restored copy of the postoffice to the
   current postoffice.

<P><LI>The user will then have access to old mail, and any private and shared
   folders that the user created. The user will not be readded to groups
   that he or she was a part of before deletion. Consequently, group
   folders created by the user will no longer be available.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This process simplifies the restore by not requiring archiving/unarchiving
of folders. However, the user will now have a new hexid, and all PAB
entries referencing this user will be invalid.
