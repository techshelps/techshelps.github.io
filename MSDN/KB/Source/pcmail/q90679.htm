<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks was released on July 15,
1992. Version 3.0a was released on September 9, 1992, and version 3.0b was
released on October 7, 1992. The following is a description of the changes
made in versions 3.0a and 3.0b.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Mail 3.0a</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Modified EXTERNAL.EXE so that it correctly transfers mail to postoffices
   when using dynamic drives.

<LI>Modified IMPORT.EXE so that it correctly imports SNADS and PROFS
   addresses into the postoffice address list when the -A parameter is
   used.
<P>
</UL><h3>Mail 3.0b</h3>
 
<P>
MS-DOS Client:

<UL><LI>Modified the MS-DOS client to work correctly with the MS-DOS 5.0 Task
   Swapper.

<LI>Resolved some international issues.
<P>
</UL>Windows/PM Client:

<UL><LI>Added the ability to Import/Export folders. This was done through
   the use of a custom command.

<LI>Added auto detection/correction of a damaged mail message file (MMF).

<LI>Added the ability to read, write, and delete messages in group folders.

<LI>Resolved problems with displaying the template information of gateway
   users.

<LI>SHARE is no longer required when the MMF is stored on the server. If the
   MMF is local, then SHARE is still required.

<LI>Resolved some problems with SETUP.EXE.

<LI>Resolved problems with Windows hanging when trying to exit Windows. If
   Windows was closed with Mail still loaded, the system could hang.

<LI>Resolved the problem with not being able to access an attachment in a
   message that comes from a shared folder, when the originator is using
   the Macintosh client.
