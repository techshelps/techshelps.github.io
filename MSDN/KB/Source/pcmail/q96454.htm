The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Extensions, version 3.0, for Microsoft
   Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
This article explains the steps necessary to install version 3.0 of
Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Extensions for Microsoft Windows version 3.1
for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>Postoffice/Server Upgrade</h3>
 
<P>
Working from the Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) workstation that contains
the WFWG postoffice, follow the steps below to complete the Extension
process.
<P>
NOTE: Before you proceed, make sure all users on the postoffice have exited
and signed out of Mail.

<OL><P><LI>To convert the existing WFWG postoffice to a full version 3.0 Microsoft
   Mail for PC Networks postoffice, run the EXTEND.EXE program from the
   Server Version - Disk 1 disk. Follow the instructions, inserting disks
   as prompted, until the Extend process is complete.
<P>
   a. You will be prompted to specify a directory for the mail executables.
<P><PRE>      WARNING: Do NOT specify the Windows directory. Microsoft suggests you
      use the C:\MAILEXE directory.
</PRE><P>
   b. You will be prompted to specify the location of the current WFWG
<P><PRE>      postoffice. The default is C:\WINDOWS\WGPO.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Using the disks labeled Windows Based and OS/2 Presentation Manager
   Based Workstation Version - Disk 1, run the INSTALL.EXE program. Follow
   the instructions, inserting disks as prompted, until the Install process
   is complete.
<P>
   You will be prompted to specify the location of the Mail executables.
   Specify the same directory location you specified in step 1a above.

<P><LI>Using the disks labeled MS-DOS Based Workstation Version - Disk 1, run
   the INSTALL.EXE program. Follow the instructions, inserting disks as
   prompted, until the Install process is complete.
<P>
   You will be prompted to specify the location of the Mail executables.
   Specify the same directory location you specified in step 1a above.
<P>
   NOTE: You should always install the MS-DOS-based workstation even if all
   your users will be running different workstation software. The MS-DOS
   client installation copies files needed by other Microsoft Mail
   components. It may also be helpful when troubleshooting the Mail system.

<P><LI>From the WFWG File Manager, share the Mail executables directory with
   full rights.

<P><LI>From File Manager, share the postoffice directory with full rights.

<P><LI>For Macintosh users only: Use the disk labeled Apple Macintosh
   Workstation Version and follow the steps listed in on page 10 in
   Chapter 1 of the "Microsoft Mail Administrator's Guide."

<P><LI>Use the Mail administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) on a nondedicated WFWG
   server.
<P>
   After the WFWG postoffice has been upgraded to a full Mail 3.0
   postoffice, the postoffice administration is handled through the MS-DOS
   based Administrator (ADMIN.EXE) program. By default, the Administrator
   program looks for the postoffice on the current directory of drive M.
   If you are using a peer-to-peer network and the postoffice is located
   on a nondedicated server, use the MS-DOS SUBST command to assign the M
   drive to the postoffice. For convenience, you can add this SUBST command
   to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      subst m: c:\windows\wgpo
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The term "nondedicated" refers to a WFWG machine being used both
   as a workstation and as the postoffice server.

<P><LI>Create the Schedule+ Mail Administrator account "adminsch". For more
   information, see page 7 in Chapter 2 of the "Microsoft Schedule+ for
   Windows Administrator's Guide."

<P><LI>Use the Schedule+ disks and follow the instructions on pages 7 and 8 of
   the "Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows Administrator's Guide" to upgrade
   the server portion of Schedule+.
<P>
</OL>The Postoffice upgrade is now complete.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows Mail Client Upgrade</h3>
 
<P>
From each user's workstation, complete the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the Windows File Manager, connect drive M to the shared postoffice
   directory.

<P><LI>Connect to the shared mail executables directory, using any drive
   letter.

<P><LI>Double-click SETUP.EXE, which is located in the mail executables
   directory. You will be prompted for a directory location to install
   Microsoft Mail. Microsoft suggests you use the C:\MSMAIL directory.
<P>
</OL>Follow the instructions until the Microsoft Mail Windows client upgrade is
complete.
<P>
<P><h3>Schedule+ Client Upgrade</h3>
 
<P>
From each user's workstation, complete the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the Windows File Manager, connect drive M to the shared postoffice
   directory.

<P><LI>Connect to the shared Schedule+ directory, using any drive letter.

<P><LI>Double-click SETUP.EXE, which is located in the shared Schedule+
