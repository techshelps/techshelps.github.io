The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, running with
   Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0 or 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to read a message from a form that was created using version
1.0 of the Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, the following error message
may be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   The type of the data did not match the type requested

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Two possible causes of this error are:

<UL><LI>Controls with the same Tag property have different data types.

<LI>Multiple controls on the Compose/Read form have the same Tag
   property defined.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Be sure to use unique Tag properties.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a form is sent, the WriteTaggedControls() function is called to
automatically package each of the controls on a form with a non-empty Tag
property. The type of control determines what information is written to the
package. (For a complete list of properties written to the package based on
control type, see page 63 in Chapter 5 of the Microsoft Electronic Forms
Designer "Developer's Guide.")
<P>
Similarly, when the form is read, the ReadTaggedControls() function is
called to unpackage the data. This function extracts information from the
package and assigns it to the corresponding Tagged control. If, for
example, a control on the Compose form writes a value to the package but is
mapped to a control on the Read form that expects text, the above error is
displayed.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
Suppose you design an E-form so that the selection from a list box on the
Compose form is written to a read-only text edit control on the Read form,
by trying to use the same "version" Tag property for both controls. When
the form is sent, the index of the list box selection is written to the
package as a Long data type. When the form is read, the text box with Tag
"version" is expecting a String data type, but instead receives a Long.
This generates the error message above.
<P>
To solve the problem of handling unlike data types, you can add additional
code to the WriteMessage() and ReadMessage() functions to package the data
manually. For more information on handling list boxes, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   MailPCForms and list box

</PRE>The error message described in this article may also occur when multiple
controls have the same Tag property defined. If two controls of different
types have the same Tag property, the ReadMessage() function may try to
assign an inappropriate value to a control on the Read form.
<P>
To solve this problem, be sure to use unique Tag properties.
