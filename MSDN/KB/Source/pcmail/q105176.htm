The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you attach a Lotus 1-2-3 file to a mail message, the formatted
WYSIWYG file is not automatically attached. If both files are attached
to a version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 Microsoft Mail for Windows message and
you start the Lotus 1-2-3 file, the WYSIWYG file is not automatically
invoked.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Versions of Lotus 1-2-3 earlier than version 4.0 use either an add-in
module (WYSIWYG) or Allways to generate the enhanced formatting of the
spreadsheet file. These enhancements are stored in a separate file.
Because Allways and WYSIWYG perform in the same manner, this article
will refer to the WYSIWYG .FM3 file extension. All references to Lotus
1-2-3 are for file formats earlier than version 4.0.
<P>
When you start up a Lotus 1-2-3 file and WYSIWYG is invoked, the
program searches for both a .WKx file and a .FM3 file in the same
directory. If the program finds both, it opens the .WKx file and then
starts WYSIWYG to bring up the enhanced formatting. There is no form
of coupling between the files, and the spreadsheet file is completely
unaware of the existence of the formatting file. To "see" the special
formatting, the sender must attach both the spreadsheet file and the
format file. The receiver must save both attachments to the same
subdirectory, start Lotus 1-2-3, and then open the spreadsheet file in
that subdirectory.
<P>
With Lotus 1-2-3 version 4.0, a new file format (.WK4) has been
introduced. Like Microsoft Excel, the graphics/formatting information
is contained in the spreadsheet file. However, in an environment where
there are several versions of Lotus 1-2-3, separate format and
spreadsheet files are created for the older versions and, thus, the
original problem occurs again.
<P>
This behavior is independent of Microsoft Mail and has been confirmed
with Lotus Technical Support. The same results can be achieved from
the Windows Program Manager by placing the format file in a separate
subdirectory from the spreadsheet file and then double-clicking the
spreadsheet file.
<P>
Lotus 1-2-3 and Allways are manufactured by Lotus Corporation, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
