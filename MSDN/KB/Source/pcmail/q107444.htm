The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides a replacement for the SETUP.EXE and SETUP.INF files
included in version 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for Windows.
<P>
The information below outlines procedures for users to run Mail for Windows
from the network without storing Mail files on their local workstations.
<P>
For complete information about obtaining the SETUP.EXE and SETUP.INF files,
see the "To download the updated file" section below.
<P>
The network administrator can use the outlined procedures to set up version
3.2a of Microsoft Mail so users can run Mail for Windows from the network
without storing Mail files on their local workstations.

<UL><LI>"Running Windows and Mail from the Network--Same Directory"
   explains how to set up Mail for Windows when users run both
   Microsoft Windows and version 3.2a of Mail for Windows from the same
   network directory.

<LI>"Running Windows and Mail from the Network--Different Directories"
   explains how to set up Mail for Windows when users run both Windows
   and Mail for Windows from different network directories.

<LI>"Running Windows Locally and Mail from the Network" explains how to
   set up Mail for Windows when users run Windows locally and run Mail
   for Windows from the network.

<LI>"Running Windows from the Network and Mail Locally" explains how to
   set up Mail for Windows when users run Windows from the network and
   run Mail for Windows locally.
<P>
   Notes:
<P>
   To use Advanced Security (MAIL.DAT) in a shared Windows
   environment, two files must be updated: the SETUP.EXE file (included
   in this update) and MSSFS.DLL version 3.2.0.4079 (included in
   MSSFS.EXE on the Microsoft Software Library (MSL)).
<P>
   Because the file I/O that normally occurs on the local workstation
   is being handled by the network, Mail's performance may decrease if
   you run Mail for Windows from the network.

Definitions

<UL><LI>&lt;MAILDATA&gt; refers to the directory containing the Mail database.
<LI>&lt;MAILEXE&gt; refers to the directory containing the Mail executable
   files.
<LI>&lt;WINSHARE&gt; refers to the shared location of the network
   installation of Windows.
<LI>&lt;MYDIR&gt; refers to the user's Windows directory on the file server
   (where the user's .INI and .GRP files are located).
<P>
</UL>Installation Steps
<P>
To set up the Mail 3.2a shared files

<OL><P><LI>Install Windows in a server directory (&lt;WINSHARE&gt;) and designate a
   drive letter for the directory. Set full rights for Supervisor,
   ReadOnly, and FileScan (for Novell networks) for all users.

<P><LI>Install the Mail postoffice in the &lt;MAILDATA&gt; and &lt;MAILEXE&gt;
   directories as described on pages 6-10 in the Microsoft Mail 3.2
   "Administrator's Guide." Designate drive letters for each
   directory.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\setup.* &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
   extracting SETUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and
   directory where your SETUP.EXE and SETUP.INF files currently reside.
   For example, if you ran the self-extracting file from the TEST
   directory on drive D, and the SETUP.EXE and SETUP.INF files are
   located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following
   command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy d:\test\setup.* c:\mailexe
</PRE>
<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;mailexe&gt;\setup.inf &lt;mailexe&gt;\setupinf.old
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;mailexe&gt; is the complete path to the directory containing
   the Microsoft Mail for Windows SETUP.EXE program. For example, if
   SETUP.EXE is located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the
   following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\mailexe\setup.inf c:\mailexe\setupinf.old
</PRE>
<P><LI>Using any text editor, edit the SETUP.INF file. In the [Setup]
   section, replace the following line
<P>
<P><PRE>      1, setup.exe,,,, 1993-03-09, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY,,,,,,
      62608,,,, 3.2.0.4027,

      62880,,,, 3.2.0.4076,
</PRE><P>
   Save the file and close the text editor.
<P>
   NOTE: For these changes to affect the entire network, each existing
   user must run Setup again.

<P><LI>Log on to the network as Supervisor and run Windows from the
   &lt;WINSHARE&gt; directory. In Windows File Manager, go to the &lt;MAILEXE&gt;
   directory and start the Setup program by double-clicking the
   SETUP.EXE file. When the Setup program prompts you for the
   Microsoft Mail directory, type WINSHARE as the location. For
   example, if the network version of Windows is located in the WIN31
   directory on drive X, type X:\WIN31. This will install all the Mail
   program files in the same directory as Windows.
<P>
</OL>To set up a user for Mail 3.2a

<OL><P><LI>Install Windows to &lt;MYDIR&gt; on the server using the following
   command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      setup /n
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run Windows from &lt;MYDIR&gt;. In Windows File Manager, go to the
   &lt;MAILEXE&gt; directory and start the Setup program by double-clicking
   the SETUP.EXE file. When the Setup program prompts you for the
   Microsoft Mail directory, type WINSHARE as the location. For
   example, if the network version of Windows is located in the WIN31
   directory on drive X, type X:\WIN31. This will install Mail in the
   Windows shared directory on the server and create an MSMAIL
   directory in the &lt;MYDIR&gt; directory on the server containing the
   user's .INI files.
