</PRE> 
SECTION 1 : MAIL
 
<P>
<P><h2>A. RECOVERING FROM MISTYPING YOUR PASSWORD THE FIRST TIME</h2>
 
<P>
If you mistype your password when signing in for the first time, you
need to delete the message file (.MMF) and try again. If you are using
the Mail Remote driver, delete the file [windows_directory]\MSMAIL.MMF.
If you are using the AT&amp;T driver, delete the file
[windows_directory]\MS_ATT.MMF.
<P>
<P><h2>B. PASSWORD PROBLEMS AND SWITCHING MAIL DRIVERS</h2>
 
<P>
When using AT&amp;T, the password for your .MMF file must be the same
as the primary AT&amp;T password. Do not change this password without
first requesting a new password from AT&amp;T. If you are using the
Mail Remote driver, the password is the same as the password set
for the .MMF file. For the LAN driver, the password must be the
same as the mailbox postoffice password.
<P>
<P><h2>C. DO NOT EXPORT DIRECTLY TO A TRANSPORT MESSAGE FILE</h2>
 
<P>
Do not use the Export command on the File menu to copy folders between
the primary transport message files (e.g. MSMAIL.MMF and MS_ATT.MMF).
If you do, the Personal Address Book (PAB) is cleared in the destination
message file. The PAB associated with the current driver is copied to the
destination message file.
<P>
<P><h2>D. SETTING UP MAIL REMOTE ACROSS A NETWORK</h2>
 
<P>
You can set up Mail Remote across a network by copying Disk 1 to a
directory called \DISK1, Disk 2 to \DISK2, and Disk 3 to \DISK3.
Then run SETUP.EXE, located in the \DISK1 directory.
<P>
<P><h2>E. MULTIPLE MSMAIL.INI FILES</h2>
 
<P>
Do not store an MSMAIL.INI file in the same directory as the MSMAIL.EXE
file unless you use the Windows directory. If you store these files in
the same directory (other than the Windows directory), Mail will not find
the correct INI settings.
<P>
<P><h2>F. LAN CARD INSTALLATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you're running MS-DOS and have a LAN card installed, it's best not to
configure it to use IRQ2. Instead, use IRQ5 to avoid losing serial port
interrupts.
<P>
<P><h2>G. MAIL AND SHARE.EXE</h2>
 
<P>
If your message file (.MMF) is on your local hard disk, you must run
SHARE.EXE before starting Windows and running Microsoft Mail for Windows.
If you don't, Mail will not start, and the file that contains your messages
might be accessed by other mail-related applications. SHARE.EXE enables
each program that accesses your messages to lock portions of the file
and protect the other mail-related applications from overwriting
information in the file.
<P>
If you are running Mail in Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
in 386-enhanced mode, VSHARE.386 is loaded automatically. SHARE.EXE
is not needed.
<P>
Setup installs SHARE.EXE if it detects that it is needed. You need to
restart your computer for it to take effect.
<P>
<P><h2>H. ENTERING ADDRESSES DIRECTLY ON THE TO: LINE</h2>
 
<P>
To enter addresses directly on the TO: line without first adding them
to the PAB, enclose the address in square brackets. For example, type
[MS:network/postoffice/user] to send mail to a Microsoft Mail user.
Type [AT&amp;T:!user] to send mail to an AT&amp;T user.
<P>
<P><h2>I. INSTALLING OVER ANOTHER COPY OF THE WINDOWS MAIL CLIENT</h2>
 
<P>
Installing Mail Remote over version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for Windows
replaces the version 3.0 Help file and removes all embedded Help links
to the Demos. To prevent this, rename the MSMAIL.HLP file before you
install Mail Remote, and restore it after installation.
<P>
If you install Mail Remote over Microsoft Mail for Windows, the current
mail driver does not change. To change to the Mail Remote driver, use
the Microsoft Mail System Selector.
<P>
<P><h2>J. USING MAIL REMOTE WITH SCHEDULE+</h2>
 
<P>
When your computer is disconnected from the LAN, you cannot initiate a
meeting request with Schedule+. You can receive and respond to meeting
requests but they will not be automatically booked in your calendar file.
If you use the Schedule+ Reminder utility with multiple mail drivers, you
may be prompted twice to sign in.
<P>
 
SECTION 2 : MAIL REMOTE DRIVER
 
<P>
<P><h2>A. USING EXTENDED CHARACTERS IN SCRIPTS</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to use extended characters in scripts, you must use a Windows
text editor (for example, Notepad) to enter ANSI characters. If you
use an MS-DOS editor, the characters are entered with the wrong code page
and do not appear properly.
<P>
<P><h2>B. SENDING MESSAGES TO POSTOFFICE GROUPS</h2>
 
<P>
Do not address a message to a postoffice group if that postoffice group
contains addresses that are not local to that postoffice. If you do, your
message is delivered to the local addresses but not to any of the
others.
<P>
<P><h2>C. MIXING MAIL REMOTE AND POSTOFFICE LANGUAGE VERSIONS</h2>
 
<P>
To use Mail Remote with a postoffice in a different language, the foreign
postoffice must first install Microsoft Mail for MS-DOS in the same
language as Mail Remote. For example, to use the French version of Mail
Remote on a German postoffice, the French version of Microsoft Mail for MS-
DOS must first be installed on the German postoffice. Then use the
Regenerate command on the Remote menu before issuing the data disk for the
French version of Mail Remote. This is required in order for Mail Remote to
find the correct template files.
<P>
<P><h2>D. USING GATEWAY ADDRESS LISTS</h2>
 
<P>
Mail Remote does not provide remote access to gateway address lists.
<P>
To access SMTP, X400, FAX, MHS and MCI gateways:
<P>
From the postoffice, copy to the data disk the .NME and .GLB files that
have the same name as the gateway. Setup will then install the files in
the directories with the same name as those file types found in
[windows_directory]\MSMAIL\MSRMT. The gateway appears in the address book.
<P>
This procedure does not work for OfficeVision, PROFS, or SNADS gateways;
however, it is possible to add all PROFS or SNADS users to a custom view.
To do this, use the following procedure when you create the custom view
with ADMIN:

<OL><P><LI>Highlight the gateway (PROFS or SNADS) with the spacebar.
</OL>2. Press ESC (rather than ENTER to choose individual names).
<P>
<P><h2>E. CHANGING THE DATA FILES</h2>
 
<P>
You can change the data files by selecting Options on the Mail menu, then
choosing the Server button. To change the data files without running Mail,
copy them to the [windows_directory]\MSMAIL\MSRMT\USERINFO directory. The
data files are installed when you start Mail. To disable the data files:

<OL><P><LI>Delete the .GLB files in [windows_directory]\MSMAIL\MSRMT\GLB.
</OL>2. Delete all files in [windows_directory]\MSMAIL\MSRMT\MBG.
3. Delete all files in [windows_directory]\MSMAIL\MSRMT\KEY.
<P>
When you start Mail, you are prompted for new data files.
<P>
<P><h2>F. CARRIER DETECTION AND SERIAL CABLES</h2>
 
<P>
If you continually get "Carrier Lost" messages when you connect, you may
be using an incorrect serial cable. Many printer serial cables only hook up
a subset of the connection pins and exclude the DCD pin which Mail Remote
needs to detect the carrier. Use a serial cable that has the following pins
connected:
<P>
<PRE> 2     TD      Transfer data
 3     RD      RCV data
 4     RTS     Request to send
 5     CTS     Clear to send
 6     DSR     Data set ready
 7     SG      Signal ground
 8     DCD     Data carrier detect
20     DTR     Data terminal ready
22     RI      Ring indicator

</PRE></OL><h2>G. RECEIVING MAIL FROM *SPECIAL</h2>
 
<P>
Do not sign in to Microsoft Mail for Windows and leave it running, and then
use Mail Remote to access mail. The LAN client will intercept system mail
(from *SPECIAL) and interfere with remote access.
<P>
<P><h2>H. CONNECTION TIME-OUTS BETWEEN SENDING AND RETRIEVING MESSAGES</h2>
 
<P>
If you have a lot of headers in your mailbox, the connection may time-out
while External prepares to transmit the headers list. to increase the
time-out time limit, first make sure that Mail Remote is the current
driver.
<P>
Then increase the value for ConnectTimeOut in the MSMAIL.INI file, located
in the Windows directory.
<P>
<P><h2>I. MODEM SCRIPT FILES</h2>
 
<P>
Script files developed for Microsoft Mail Remote for MS-DOS should work
unmodified with Mail Remote for Windows. If a script doesn't work, it may
be because of a timing problem in the script.
<P>

   Dual Standard.

</PRE><h2>J. CONNECT ON EXIT OPTION LEADS TO MISLEADING ERROR MESSAGE</h2>
 
<P>
If you select the "Connect on Exit" option in the Session Setup dialog
and Exit Mail when there are no messages in the outbox, you will get
an error message about driver incompatibility. This is a false error
message and can be ignored. We recommend that you do not use this option
since Mail will warn you if you have any mail in the outbox when you Exit
and give you the option to send it.
<P>
<P>
 
SECTION 3 : AT&amp;T MAIL DRIVER
 
<P>
<P><h2>A. ENTERING ADDRESSES FOR AT&amp;T USERS, MAILING LISTS, AND SHARED FOLDERS</h2>
 
<P>
Do not enter non-alphanumeric characters (for example !, :, ~) in the
address templates for AT&amp;T users, mailing lists, and shared folders. These
characters are added by the AT&amp;T Mail driver. If they are entered into
the address template, messages will fail with incorrect addressing.
<P>
<P><h2>B. CHANGING THE AT&amp;T USER ID YOU SIGN IN WITH</h2>
 
<P>
The AT&amp;T User ID you use to first sign in is permanently associated with
the message file ([windows_directory]\MS_ATT.MMF) that gets created. To
change the ID and the password associated with it, you must create a new
AT&amp;T message file as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Exit and sign out of Mail Remote.

<P><LI>Use Notepad or another text editor to open the file
   [windows_directory]\MSMAIL.INI.

<P><LI>Find the [ATTTransport] section. Delete any entries in this section
   that begin with Password= and SecondaryPassword=.

<P><LI>Find the "MMFStoreName=" INI variable in the [ATTDefaults] section.

<P><LI>Change the variable to a new message file name.

<P><LI>Save the change and exit Notepad.

<P><LI>Start Mail Remote and enter the new User ID and Password.

<P><LI>When the Open Message File dialog box appears, select New.
<P>
</OL><h2>C. SHARING THE AT&amp;T MESSAGE FILE WITH MICROSOFT MAIL</h2>
 
<P>
The AT&amp;T Mail driver creates its own message file, called MS_ATT.MMF,
in the Windows directory. If you are using the Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks or the Mail Remote driver, you can share the AT&amp;T message file.
<P>
CAUTION: This procedure copies the Personal Address Book to the AT&amp;T
message file. It's best to use this procedure only after you've run Mail
Remote with the AT&amp;T driver the first time, since copying the Personal
Address Book to the AT&amp;T message file overwrites existing addresses.
<P>
To share the AT&amp;T message file with Microsoft Mail:

<OL><P><LI>If you haven't already run Mail Remote with the AT&amp;T Mail driver, do
    so.

<P><LI>Exit and sign out.

<P><LI>Use the Microsoft Mail System Selector to change the current driver to
    Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

<P><LI>Start Mail Remote.

<P><LI>Choose Export Folder from the File menu. Select
    [windows_directory]\MS_ATT.MMF as the destination file name.

<P><LI>Exit and sign out.

<P><LI>Rename the original local message store used by the LAN and Remote
    drivers.

<P><LI>Start Mail Remote again (make sure the Mail Remote or Microsoft Mail
    for PC Networks driver is current).
<P>
    A message tells you that the message file could not be found, since it
    no longer exists in the original location with the original file name.
    Mail Remote prompts you to locate the message file or create a new one.

<P><LI>Enter the name of the AT&amp;T message file, which now contains all the
    information from the original message file (including the Personal
    Address Book).

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL><h2>D. REDUCING THE TIME FOR CONNECTION TIME-OUTS</h2>
 
<P>
If you interrupt the connection, and the Carrier Detect check box is
cleared, Mail may take several minutes to time out. To make the time-out
faster, select the Carrier Detect check box. To do this, choose
Communications from the Mail menu, then choose the Communications button.
The Communications dialog box appears with the Carrier Detect check box.
Before you do this, make sure your modem cable has a data carrier detect
pin. If it does not, and you select the Carrier Detect check box, the
modem will not connect to the AT&amp;T Mail Service.
<P>
For more information about the carrier detect option, see section F,
"Carrier Detection and Serial Cables" in section 2, "Mail Remote Driver."
<P>
<P><h2>E. POSSIBLE GP-FAULT IN MAILING LIST DIALOG WITH SLOW VIDEO SYSTEMS</h2>
 
<P>
After sending or retrieving mailing lists using PCs with slow video systems
avoid any operations before the mailing list dialog can redraw itself.
