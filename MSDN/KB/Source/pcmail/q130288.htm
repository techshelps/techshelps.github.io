The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to monitor CPU utilization in Microsoft Windows
NT when you run either the Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for
Windows NT (NT MMTA) or the Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for OS/2
(MMTA).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you run multiple instances of the MMTA, it may create a situation where
the CPU cannot adequately service all processes running on that machine.
You can detect this situation by using the Windows NT application
Performance Monitor (found in the Administrative Tools group).
<P>
To detect this situation, first check the %Processor Time counter.
%Processor Time is expressed as a percentage of the elapsed time that a
processor is busy executing a non-Idle thread. It can be viewed as the
fraction of the time spent doing useful work. Each processor is assigned an
Idle thread in the Idle process that consumes those unproductive processor
cycles not used by any other threads.
<P>
<P><h3>To monitor %Processor Time</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Run Performance Monitor from the Administrative Tools group.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Add to Chart.

<P><LI>Select the machine that External or Dispatch is running on from the
   Computer option.

<P><LI>From the Object checkbox, select Process.

<P><LI>From the Counter checkbox, select %Processor Time.

<P><LI>Click Add. Then click Done.
<P>
</OL>%Processor time greater than 90 percent on average can indicate that the
processor is being over utilized, and it can cause problems.
<P>
To further analyze this situation, it is possible to monitor an individual
process' %Processor Time. Process - %Processor Time is the percentage of
elapsed time that all of the threads of this process used in order for the
processor to execute instructions. An instruction is the basic unit of
execution in a computer; a thread is the object that executes instructions,
and a process is the object created when a program is run. Code executed to
handle certain hardware interrupts or trap conditions may be counted for
this process.
<P>
<P><h3>To monitor individual External and Dispatch processes</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Run Performance Monitor from the Administrative Tools group.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Add to Chart.

<P><LI>Select the machine that External or Dispatch is running on from the
   Computer item.

<P><LI>From the Object checkbox, select Process.

<P><LI>From the Counter checkbox, select %Processor Time.

<P><LI>From the Instance checkbox, select all the OS2 instances.

<P><LI>Click Add. Then click Done.
<P>
</OL>The OS2 counter is the client side of every OS/2 application. There is an
instance of OS2.EXE for each OS/2 application that is running. External
will launch two processes of OS2.EXE because it is multithreaded, where
Dispatch will launch only one.
<P>
Also, if the machine running External and Dispatch is also running other
network applications, then monitor these processes. If any one process is
taking an inordinate amount of CPU time, move that process to another
Windows NT machine to improve External's performance.
<P>
Performance monitor might show 100 percent CPU utilization when SCHDIST.EXE
is running. Schdist is running normally under Windows NT, and the
Performance Monitor is giving an incorrect reading on CPU utilization.
