<P><h3>PC Adm: Microsoft Mail ADMIN.EXE 3.2.12 Update</h3>
 
ARTICLE ID:<B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q107443.htm">Q107443</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: ADMIN.EXE

<UL><LI>With the earlier version of this file, a corrupt .MAI file could be
   created when you export the address list to a large number of
   postoffices. ADMIN.EXE has been modified so that the correct .MAI
   file is created when address lists are exported.

<LI>With the earlier version of this file, a corrupt SRVCONF.GLB file
   could be created when you add a Directory Synchronization (Dir-
   Sync) requestor on a computer that has an EtherExpress(TM) 16
   network card and is running the Ethernet_II protocol. ADMIN.EXE has
   been modified so that it uses a buffer size of 512 bytes instead of
   1K for its buffered I/O.

<LI>If a Mail Remote for Windows user forgets his or her password or if
   the password is changed while the remote driver is in use, the
   password can now be reset.
<P>
   NOTE: To reset the password, you must ensure that the user's data disk
   was created using ADMIN.EXE version 3.2.9 or later.

<LI>Local postoffice users added with the ADMIN.EXE utility will no
   longer be assigned an invalid identification number if the TID.GLB
   file is locked open. Also, batch creation of local postoffice users
   with the ADMIN.EXE utility while the TID.GLB file is locked open no
   longer results in the same invalid identification number being assigned
   to multiple users.

<LI>When you use ADMIN.EXE to change the routing type defined for a hub
   postoffice, the routing type definition for any downstream
   postoffice is also updated to match the routing type of the hub
   postoffice.

<LI>When you use ADMIN.EXE to remove users from a global group, access
   to group folders associated with that global group is also removed.

<LI>Correct figures are now reported when you use the Mail
   Administrator program to create reports that involve multiple
   postoffices with more than 32,768 users.
<P>
</UL> 
<P><h3>PC Adm: Removed User Still Has Access to Group Folder</h3>
 
ARTICLE ID:<B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q105967.htm">Q105967</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: ADMIN.EXE
<P>
With versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, a user removed from a Global group may still have access to
any group folders associated with that Global group.
<P>
A Global group is defined as a group that is created from the Mail
Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) and that is available in the
postoffice address list (POL).
<P>
 
PC Ext: EXTERNAL.EXE 3.2.13 Update
 
ARTICLE ID:<B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q111558.htm">Q111558</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: EXTERNAL.EXE

<UL><LI>NetBIOS notification does not work when the sender and receiver are
   on different postoffices and there are multiple External Mail
   programs running. The only time notification works is if the first
   External Mail program that was started up dispatches mail between
   the sender's and receiver's postoffices.

<LI>On Novell(R) networks, the RNETWORK.GLB file is not updated at 4:00
   A.M. on any drives that are dynamically attached.

<LI>In low-memory conditions, the External Mail program deletes mail
   from the outgoing mail queue without returning that mail to the
   sender. There are error messages in the SESSION.LOG and SYSTEM.LOG,
   but the mail file is still deleted. In most cases, the sender is
   not notified that the mail was not delivered. With the updated
   External Mail program, the mail message is not deleted but remains
   in the outgoing queue, and the External Mail program still attempts
   to deliver the mail. Because there is not enough memory to return
   the message to the sender, there is no entry in the SYSTEM.LOG. The
   administrator can return the mail from the queue.

<LI>When the EXTERNAL.INI parameter MinKDiskFull is not included in the
   EXTERNAL.INI file, the default value of 0 is used. This causes the
   External Mail program to attempt to deliver mail to a postoffice
   that has no disk space. The default value for MinKDiskFull has now
   been changed from 0 to 100K.

<LI>When the External Mail program marks a dynamic drive as being full
   (no disk space), it is not checked again until the External Mail
   program is restarted. The External Mail program now checks dynamic
   drives that are full on every cycle and changes their status if
   disk space becomes available.

<LI>Messages transferred asynchronously or through an X.25 connection
   do not get time stamped. Therefore, when you view the received
   message in Mail for Windows, the received date/time is actually the
   date/time it was composed, not the date/time it was received by
   External. The External Mail program now time stamps all messages.

<LI>The External Mail program sometimes hangs when CommType=X25EICON.
   The CommType setting can be specified in the .INI file or on the
   command line for External.

<LI>Versions 3.2.5 and 3.2.6 of the External Mail program mark a static
   drive as being full (no disk space) and the drive is not checked
   again until the External Mail program is restarted. The External
   Mail program now checks static drives that are full on every cycle
   and changes their status if disk space becomes available.

<LI>Mail sent to Remote Mail users would not be recorded in the
   SENT.LOG file if the LogSent option was specified in the
   EXTERNAL.INI file or if the -ms command-line option was included
   when the External Mail program was started. Version 3.2.9 of the
   External Mail program will correctly log mail sent to Remote Mail
   users in the SENT.LOG file.

<LI>When the Import utility is run with the autocreate function, and
   the External Mail program is also run against the same postoffice
   across a wide-area network (WAN) connection or in a high mail
   traffic situation, the Import utility may report "Fatal [59] Error
   autocreating postoffice: XXXXXXXXXX." This error occurs because of
   .XTN file contention between the External Mail program and the
   Import utility. Under normal circumstances, the External Mail
   program holds an .XTN file open for a very short interval and file
   contention is not an issue. Version 3.2.9 of the External Mail
   program now allows the Import utility to have write access to the
   .XTN file.

<LI>The External Mail program now determines and uses the appropriate
   international date format when the MS-DOS country command is used
   in the CONFIG.SYS file of the workstation running External.

<LI>The MinKDiskFull and MinKDiskNotFull parameters and their specified
   values are now recorded in the SESSION.LOG file and are displayed
   on screen in the External Mail program's LAN Postoffice Mail
   Activity display area when you use EXTERNAL.INI file entries and
   the undocumented -q1 command-line switch. Previously, logging of
   these parameters and their specified values would only occur when
   you used command-line parameters and the undocumented -q1 command-
   line switch.

<P><h3>PC Ext: Err Msg: Retry Count Exceeded</h3>
 
ARTICLE ID:<B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q113165.htm">Q113165</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: EXTERNAL.EXE
<P>
With version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when EXTERNAL.EXE
cannot deliver mail to a *.MAI file, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Retry count exceeded

</PRE>External generates this error after it has tried to deliver the message
three times. It takes approximately 16 minutes to make the three attempts.
If the file remains locked, External's copy of the message is destroyed.
You can tell this problem has occurred by looking in the sending
postoffice's SESSION.LOG and SYSTEM.LOG files for "Retry Count Exceeded"
and "Missing Message File" messages.
<P>
 
<P><h3>PC Adm: IMPORT.EXE 3.2.9 Update</h3>
 
ARTICLE ID:<B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q111556.htm">Q111556</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: IMPORT.EXE

<UL><LI>The Import utility (with the -A option) no longer adds invalid DGN
   names to the Postoffice Address List (POL) when those names do not
   appear in the normal .USR files.

<LI>The Import utility no longer corrupts the MCI.NME file when
   importing MCI user names. This problem caused the Mail
   Administrator program to incorrectly display the MCI address
   information.

<LI>The Import utility no longer stops responding (hangs) when it
   processes RESYNC.GLB after doing heavy processing.

<LI>The Import utility now updates FLAG.GLB when it runs, causing the
   External Mail program to update its address lists on the next cycle
   interval.

<LI>The Import utility no longer does 1-byte reads of the template
   files.

<LI>When it is importing modified SNADS template information, the
   Import utility no longer incorrectly sequences the information.

<LI>When you use the Import utility to modify a user's configuration
   (any option set with an "&amp;") and that user has remote access, the
   user's remote access ability is no longer removed.

<LI>When you use the Modify transaction type to update a user in the
   POL but you do not make any changes to the user's alias, the user's
   record is no longer deleted.

<LI>When you use the -A command-line option to modify template
   information, the Import utility no longer increases the size of the
   associated .INF file on each pass. The Import utility now creates a
   new .INF file that incorporates the changes rather than appending
   the changes to the existing .INF file.

<LI>When you use the Import utility to change a user's mailbox name,
   Error 34--"Could not access log information file"--no longer occurs
   when you start the MS-DOS client.

<LI>Deleting a local user with Import no longer leaves the user's
   folder files (.IDX and .FLD) orphaned in the FOLDERS\LOC\0000????
   subdirectory of the Mail database.

<LI>A Microsoft Mail Connection 3.2 PROXYNET\PROXYPO postoffice address
   list is now propagated to a downstream requestor postoffice when
   the gateway postoffice is also the directory server postoffice. The
   Import utility now copies FFAPI postoffice address lists from the
   directory server to the GLB\RESYNC.GLB file to perform a directory
   synchronization manual import procedure.

<LI>Local postoffice users added with the Import utility will no longer
   be assigned an invalid identification number if the TID.GLB file is
   locked open. Also, batch creation of local postoffice users with
   the Import utility while the TID.GLB file is locked open no longer
   results in the same invalid identification number being assigned to
   multiple users.

<LI>Trap D errors or "An OS/2 program caused a protection violation"
   error no longer occurs under OS/2(R) or under the OS/2 subsystem of
   Windows NT(TM) when you use the Import utility with the -ST command-
   line option.

<LI>The Import utility now creates unique mailbag numbers when you add
   local postoffice users, even if the CONTROL.GLB file has been reset
   to zero.

<P><h3>PC Adm: Deleting Users w/IMPORT Leaves Orphaned Folders, .IDXs</h3>
 
ARTICLE ID:<B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q117197.htm">Q117197</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: IMPORT.EXE
<P>
When you use the IMPORT utility (IMPORT.EXE) included with versions 3.0 and
3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks to delete users from the local
postoffice, the users are deleted from the database; however, their folders
and .IDX files remain.
<P>
 
<P><h3>PC Adm: IMPORT .INF File Size Increases When IMPORT -A Is Used</h3>
 
ARTICLE ID:<B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q117198.htm">Q117198</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: IMPORT.EXE
<P>
When you use the IMPORT utility (IMPORT.EXE) included with versions 3.0 and
3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks to modify users with template
information, the size of the .INF file for this address list doubles in
size each time IMPORT.EXE is used.
<P>
 
<P><h3>PC Adm: Err: Modifying Mailbox Name Causes Notice 34 &amp; 127</h3>
 
ARTICLE ID:<B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q117259.htm">Q117259</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: IMPORT.EXE
<P>
When you use the IMPORT utility (IMPORT.EXE) included with versions 3.0 and
3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks to modify a local postoffice user's
mailbox name, the user will receive the following error when he or she logs
in to the MS-DOS client:
<P>
<PRE>   Notice 34  Could not access log information file.

</PRE>Furthermore, if this modified user tries to access any MS-DOS client
folders, he or she will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Notice 127  Private Folder Index Missing.

</PRE>The user will not be able to access, store mail in, or view his or her
private MS-DOS folders.
<P>
 
<P><h3>PC Adm: IMPORT.EXE Does Not Recover from Reset CONTROL.GLB</h3>
 
ARTICLE ID:<B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q117738.htm">Q117738</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: IMPORT.EXE
<P>
The IMPORT.EXE utility provided with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
versions 3.0 and 3.2 does not properly recover after the CONTROL.GLB file
<PRE> is reset (bytes set to zero). If the administrator uses IMPORT.EXE to
</PRE>add users to the local postoffice after a CONTROL.GLB reset, these new
users receive the same hexadecimal identifiers (hex-IDs) as existing users.
<P>
 
<P><h3>PC Adm: Microsoft Mail MOVEUSER.EXE Version 3.2.8 Update</h3>
 
ARTICLE ID:<B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q118510.htm">Q118510</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: MOVEUSER.EXE

<UL><LI>Users moved from one postoffice to another postoffice with the
   MOVEUSER utility are assigned an invalid identification number if
   the TID.GLB file on the destination postoffice is locked open.
   Moving multiple users while the TID.GLB file is locked open results
   in the same invalid identification number being assigned to
   multiple users. When Mail is addressed to one of these users, the
   other users with the same invalid identification number also get
   added to the recipients list. To avoid this problem, the MOVEUSER
   version 3.2.8 update will not move a user if the TID.GLB file is
   locked open.
<P>
</UL> 
<P><h3>PC DirSync: REBUILD.EXE 3.2.4 Update</h3>
 
ARTICLE ID:<B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q111701.htm">Q111701</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: REBUILD.EXE
<P>
On MS-DOS and Macintosh workstations, the GALNETPO.GLB file is
regenerated while REBUILD.EXE is running.
<P>
 
<P><h3>PC DirSync: Bad CRC Causes No Error; Corrupted Data in SRVCONF</h3>
 
ARTICLE ID: <B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q96153</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: REQMAIN.EXE
<P>
The following two problems can occur:

<UL><LI>When a bad CRC is found in the Dir-Sync attachment (.ATT) file, no error
   message is generated.

<LI>When you use certain brands of network cards and Novell NetWare version
   3.x, the first 6 bytes of the SRVCONF.GLB file are corrupted. This
   problem does not occur under all circumstances and is not consistent
   among operating systems. The next time SRVMAIN.EXE runs, it will fail
   because of the corrupted data.
<P>
<P>
</UL> 
<P><h3>PC DirSync: SRVMAIN.EXE 3.2.9 Update</h3>
 
ARTICLE ID:<B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q111703.htm">Q111703</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: SRVMAIN.EXE

<UL><LI>The Import utility no longer stops responding (hangs) when it
   processes RESYNC.GLB after doing heavy processing. This problem
   occurred because the heap became corrupted when it was under a
   heavy load.

<LI>The Srvmain utility no longer does one-byte reads of the template
   files.

<LI>A Microsoft Mail Connection 3.2 PROXYNET\PROXYPO postoffice address
   list is now propagated to a downstream requestor postoffice when
   the gateway postoffice is also the directory server postoffice. The
   Import utility now copies FFAPI postoffice address lists from the
   directory server to the GLB\RESYNC.GLB file to perform a directory
   synchronization manual import procedure.

<P><h3>PC DirSync: FFAPI ProxyNet/ProxyPO Not Included in Import</h3>
 
ARTICLE ID:<B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q117380</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: SRVMAIN.DLL
<P>
If an administrator to a new Mail for PC Networks postoffice requests an
import (by selecting Admin, Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Import) from the
server running directory synchronization (Dir-Sync), the new postoffice
will not receive the ProxyNet/ProxyPO names if the Dir-Sync server is also
the Mail Connection 3.2 gateway postoffice.

File Updated/Modified: CONVERT.EXE

File Updated/Modified: MAILMGR.DLL

<UL><LI>The Check Names function fails to properly resolve partial friendly
   names and returns several selections when a unique resolution is
   possible. This behavior is most obvious when the GAL is selected as
   the default address list and the first and last name of the
   intended recipient begin with the same letter.

</UL> 
<P><h3>PC MAPI: WA0729: Microsoft Mail Simple MAPI Update</h3>
 
Article ID:<B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q95522.htm">Q95522</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: MAPI.DLL

<UL><LI>Deleting a message in a shared folder does not function as
   expected; the message in the folder is deleted, but the header
   still appears. If you select the header to bring up the message,
   Mail for Windows returns a dialog box that says "The message cannot
   be accessed." Also, if you change a message in any way, the message
   becomes inaccessible.

<LI>Reply, Reply All, and Forward commands on customer messages in
   shared folders fail if these commands are called from Mail for
   Windows. This problem occurs because the client hands off the
   temporary message ID of the shared folder, instead of the permanent
   shared-folder message ID.

<LI>To correctly launch e-forms, Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer
   requires that the message type it gives to Simple MAPI be preserved
   in the delivered message. However, the message type is not encoded
   in WINMAIL.DAT by default, so it is lost across gateways.
   Therefore, the message is received and displayed as a note rather
   than as a Microsoft electronic form.

<P><h3>PC Win: Mail for Windows MSSFS.DLL 3.2.0.4074 Update</h3>
 
ARTICLE-ID:<B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q96694.htm">Q96694</A></B>
File Updated/Modified: MSSFS.DLL
<P>
The following problems can occur when you use version 3.0b of Microsoft
Mail for Windows:

<UL><LI>When you send mail to an external postoffice group or gateway group
   that contains extended characters in the address, Mail for Windows
   does not convert from code page 850 to the ANSI code page when it
   reads the records from the NETPO.GLB file or any other gateway
   address file.

<LI>External postoffices, SNADS DGNs, and nodes for PROFS(R) and
   OfficeVision(R) are not displayed in alphabetic order because Mail
   for Windows reads them in one at a time and adds them to the
   hierarchy. With the updated version of MSSFS.DLL, Mail for Windows
   reads them in all at once, sorts them, and adds them to the
   hierarchy.

<LI>An "Unknown user" error may occur when you send a message. Mail for
   Windows caches only the first 8170 bytes of the NETWORK.GLB file
   and loses the rest. Postoffices and gateways that are defined past
   8170 bytes are ignored; therefore, you cannot send messages to the
   users on those postoffices or gateways.

<LI>The simple MAPI command MAPILogon() does a case-sensitive match on
   the user name and password; however, Microsoft Mail is not case
   sensitive. This problem occurs only if a MAPI session was already
   established when MAPILogon() is called.

<LI>Incorrect message dates are displayed. When parsing old A.M./P.M.
   style dates (generated from some gateways), Mail for Windows adds
   12 to the time if it is P.M. However, if the message was sent
   during the noon hour, the time is incorrectly read as 24:xx.
   Because this is an invalid time, the date is set to the
   programmer's birthday (12/16/68).

<LI>Mail for Windows may cause a general protection (GP) fault when it
   encounters a corrupt .XTN file in the database. It does not
   properly handle .XTN files that are an incorrect size.
<P>
</UL>The following problems can occur when you use version 3.0b or 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows:

<UL><LI>Mail for Windows cannot view templates of SNADS or PROFS users when
   GALONLY=1 is set in the MSMAIL.INI file.

<LI>When you read a custom message from a shared folder, the wrong date
   is displayed.

<LI>In version 3.0b of Mail for Windows, the time stamp associated with
   resolved addresses is not saved correctly: if the Global Address
   List (GAL) was built twice in the same day, any mail addressed but
   not sent before the second rebuild could be misdirected. This
   problem was partially corrected in version 3.2 of Mail for Windows:
   the time stamp is saved correctly, thus reducing the time frame in
   which this problem could occur from one day to one clock hour.
   However, mail may still be misdirected at sites where GAL rebuilds
   are made within the same clock hour.

<LI>All users running Windows from a shared installation point must use
   the same postoffice when they use Advanced Security. This problem
   occurs because the MAIL.DAT file is saved to the Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory, which is shared among all users running Windows from
   the same location. The client now checks both the WINDOWS (user's
   local directory) and WINDOWS\SYSTEM directories, in that order, for
   the MAIL.DAT file.

<LI>Duplicate addresses are added to the Personal Address Book (PAB).

<LI>If users are running Mail for Windows from a shared installation
   point and the NETBIOS=1 flag is set in the MSMAIL.INI file, Mail
   checks the size, date, and time of the MSMAIL.INI file every 5
   seconds. Because the .INI file is on the network, frames are sent
   to the server to check the size of the file every 5 seconds, thus
   increasing traffic on the network. These checks no longer occur
   with this update.

<LI>When an urgent message is sent to an external user with NetBIOS
   notification in use, Mail for Windows does not send a NetBIOS
   datagram to the External Mail program. This process does work
   correctly when an urgent message is sent to a local user. When
   sending urgent messages, Mail for Windows now sends notifications
   to the External Mail program when NetBIOS notification is in use.

<LI>MACBinary II attachments are not recognized when originating from
   external Mail Systems.

<LI>When sending mail such that the number of recipients is greater
   than 200 (exact number depends on the specific address list), the
   body of the message will be missing.

<LI>When "Add recipients to Personal Address Book" is selected, the
   GAL.NME file is locked open each time a global address list name is
   added to a compose note.

<LI>In certain situations, viewing details of an external name from a
   group results in the error message: "A GLB file on your server is
   corrupt."

<LI>If a message has more than 22 recipients selected from the GAL and
   that message is stored in a shared folder, the message appears to
   be corrupted. Attempting to open the message from the shared folder
   results in the error: "Mail system error, Mail could not read the
   entire message from the Post Office. Some parts of the message may
   be missing. Ask the sender to resend the message."

<LI>Under certain conditions, a general protection (GP) fault can occur
   in MSSFS.DLL when the MAPILogon() function is used to begin a
   session with the messaging system.

<LI>The Check Names function fails to properly resolve partial friendly
   names and returns several selections when a unique resolution is
   possible. This behavior is most obvious when the GAL is selected as
   the default address list and the first and last name of the
   intended recipient begin with the same letter.

The following two problems can occur when attachments are launched using
version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for Windows:

<UL><LI>When you attempt to launch attachments that do not have an
   extension, an error occurs when you hold down the ALT key and
   double-click the mouse button to load the attachment in Notepad.

<LI>When you attempt to launch MACBINARY attachments, Mail for Windows
   changes the name of the file being launched if that filename is
   less than eight characters in length.
<P>
</UL>The following problems can occur when you use version 3.0b or 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows:

<UL><LI>When you open a MAPI Send note through a Windows-based application
   (for example, Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel) and the
   application is launched again via Mail, the application is brought
   to the front, but the Send note is left in the background. If the
   application is running full screen, the computer hangs because the
   active window (the Send note) will accept any keystrokes; however,
   it is hidden by the full-screen application.

Versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows appends a file
extension to an attached file received from a version 3.0 Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks, Macintosh workstation, even if the file has a valid
Microsoft MS-DOS filename.

NOTE: MS-DOS supports a filename limited to eight characters for the name
and three characters for the extension (for example, FILENAME.DOC). This
naming convention is commonly referred to as 8.3 format.

File Updated/Modified: MACLIENT.HQX

<UL><LI>With the earlier version of this file, the computer could stop
   responding when sending a message to a personal group under low
   memory conditions. The Macintosh Client file has been modified to
   correct this problem.

<LI>Some network operating systems will not allow a file to be created
   in all uppercase letters. The Macintosh Client file has been
   modified for these types of networks to allow the client to create
   filenames in lowercase letters if LOWRCASE.GLB exists in the GLB
   subdirectory of the Mail database.

<LI>With the earlier version of this file, when mail is sent to global
   groups that contain nonalphabetic characters in their names, the
   recipient field appears blank when the message is viewed by a Mail
   for Windows user. The Macintosh Client file has been modified to
   correct this problem.
