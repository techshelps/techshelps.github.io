The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0b and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides replacements for the Simple MAPI files, included with
versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, for both Microsoft
C and Microsoft Visual Basic. The replacement files provide additional
enhancements to the original Mail technical reference disk.
<P>
For complete information about obtaining and installing the Simple MAPI
files, see the following sections:

<UL><LI>To download the updated files
<LI>To update your technical reference disk
<LI>To use the technical reference manual files
<LI>To update your MAPI.DLL and FRAMEWORK.DLL files
<LI>To use the Autosend application or source code
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This update includes the following files:
<P>
<PRE>  Filename      | Description
</PRE> 
<PRE>  TECHDISK.EXE  | Mail technical reference disk
  TECHDOCS.EXE  | Mail technical reference manual
  MAPI.DLL      | Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)
                | dynamic link library
  FRAMEWRK.DLL  | Framework layer dynamic link library
  SAMPLE.EXE    | Sample Simple MAPI application for sending mail
                | automatically. Source files included.

</PRE>The Simple MAPI files included on the technical reference disk allow
application developers to include messaging capabilities in their
applications' user interfaces. Support is provided for both Microsoft
C and Microsoft Visual Basic.
<P>
This update contains TECHDISK.EXE, a replacement for the Mail technical
reference disk included with versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for
Windows. This replacement disk provides additional enhancements to
the original Mail technical reference disk and includes the following
modifications for versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows:

<UL><LI>MAPI.H has been modified to be strictly ANSI compatible, and no
   longer causes warnings on Warning Level 4 with the Microsoft C
   version 7.0 compiler.

<LI>The sample Visual Basic Simple MAPI application has been modified
   to compile when you use Microsoft Visual Basic version 2.0.
<P>
</UL>This update also contains TECHDOCS.EXE, an electronic version of the Mail
technical reference manual included with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for
Windows.
<P>
This update also includes the latest MAPI.DLL and FRAMEWRK.DLL files, and a
sample Visual Basic program called Autosend (included in the SAMPLE.EXE
file) that sends mail at specific times or intervals. The code for this
application is included to allow additional capabilities such as checking
mail response time between postoffices.
<P>
This update also contains MAPI.DLL, a replacement for the MAPI.DLL file
included with versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows. This
replacement file provides additional enhancements to the original MAPI.DLL
file and resolves the following problems that can occur when you are using
versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows:

<UL><LI>Deleting a message in a shared folder does not function as
   expected; the message in the folder is deleted, but the header
   still appears. If you select the header to bring up the message,
   Mail for Windows returns a dialog box that says "The message cannot
   be accessed." Also, if you change a message in any way, the message
   becomes inaccessible.

<LI>Reply, Reply All, and Forward commands on customer messages in
   shared folders fail if these commands are called from Mail for
   Windows. This problem occurs because the client hands off the
   temporary message ID of the shared folder, instead of the permanent
   shared-folder message ID.
<P>
   NOTE: For this problem to be resolved, two files must be updated:
   the MAPI.DLL file (included in this update) and the MSMAIL.EXE file
   (update included in MAILUPD.EXE on the MSL).

<LI>To correctly launch e-forms, Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer
   requires that the message type it gives to Simple MAPI be preserved
   in the delivered message. However, the message type is not encoded
   in WINMAIL.DAT by default, so it is lost across gateways.
   Therefore, the message is received and displayed as a note rather
   than as a Microsoft electronic form.

<LI>Custom forms that did not include their own textize maps
   could not use the provided default print/save functionality.
<P>
   NOTE: To fix this problem, MSSFS.DLL (update included in MSSFS.EXE
   on the MSL) version 3.2.4081 or later must be used in conjunction
   with the MAPI.DLL included in this update.
<P>
</UL>This update also contains FRAMEWRK.DLL, a replacement for the FRAMEWRK.DLL
file included with versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows.
This replacement file resolves the following problem that can occur when
you use versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows:

<UL><LI>When you execute the MAPIAddress() function, an "Out of Memory"
   error can occur. This problem occurs because a second MAPI session
   is being started and closed, and the MAPIAddress() function is then
   executed in the first session.
<P>
