<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when the
Check Names utility finds a match, it will stop searching the available
address lists. The purpose of the utility is to check the characters in the
To: and Cc: lines against the address lists. This helps to ensure that mail
is not being sent to an artificial user.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Check Names utility is one of the options available in the Mail for
Windows Compose screen. The Check Names utility first runs against the
default address list. If no matches are found, it will search the Global
Address List (GAL) until a match is found. As soon as the Check Names
utility finds a match, the search is considered complete and the utility
ends its search.
<P>
If you set the GAL as the default, the Check Names utility will only search
the GAL.
<P>
To set the default, select the Address button in the Compose screen. This
will open the Address dialog box. The Address Book button is on the top
left corner of the dialog box. Select the button to open the Open Directory
dialog box.
<P>
All the available address lists will be displayed and you can select which
one you want to use.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
In the Personal Address Book (PAB) are the names Andy Smith and Anna Smith.
In the Postoffice Address List (POL) are the names Andrew Smith and Anice
Smith. In the GAL are the names Anne Smith and Antoine Smith. Assume all
names belong to unique Mail users.
<P>
Suppose you choose the PAB to be the default address list and you want to
send a message to Anne Smith. You type "AN" in the To: line and click the
Check Names button to start the utility. The utility will find the names
Andy Smith and Anna Smith from the PAB and will terminate.
<P>
If you type "ANN" in the To: line, the utility will find the name Anna
Smith. If you type "ANNE" in the To: line, the utility will find the name
Anne Smith from the GAL.
<P>
Now suppose you select the POL to be the default address list and you want
to send a message to Antoine Smith. If you type "AN" in the To: line, the
utility will return the names Andrew Smith and Anice Smith from the POL. If
you type "ANT" in the To: line, the utility will return the name Antoine
Smith from the GAL.
