                             ============

</PRE>This Application Note is designed for the Mail administrator and
outlines the procedures directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) performs
during normal operation. The network administrator can use these
procedures to examine Dir-Sync files, to reset these files, or to
perform a manual Dir-Sync process to fully synchronize the postoffice
address lists (POLs). This Application Note is a supplement to the

<PRE>                                HISTORY
                                =======

</PRE>In versions of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks earlier than 3.0, Dir-
Sync was accomplished manually: each time a change was made to the
address list, each Mail administrator performed an External-Admin,
Export. As a result, many large messages would be sent to all the
postoffices as *SPECIAL messages. This was inefficient; the External
Mail program could be fully occupied with delivering and incorporating
the address changes instead of delivering user messages.
<P>
To perform synchronization with versions of Mail earlier than 3.0, the
number of system messages is N * (N - 1), where N is the number of
postoffices in your network. For example, with six postoffices, you
would have 6 * 5 = 30 system messages, as pictured below:
<P>
&lt;Graphic deleted&gt;
<P>
With Dir-Sync, the number of system messages is 2 * N, or, in this
example, 6 * 2 = 12, as pictured below:
<P>
&lt;Graphic deleted&gt;
<P>
In mathematical notation, versions 3.0 and later of Mail performs an
O(N2) operation, whereas Dir-Sync performs an O(N) operation, which is
much more efficient. For versions 2.x of Mail, doubling the number of
postoffices quadruples the number of messages; however, for Dir-Sync the
messages are only doubled. Thus, the number of messages that need to be
exchanged is substantially reduced. In addition, the sizes of the
messages are smaller because Dir-Sync only sends the changes to the
address list, not the full address list, as required by
External-Admin, Export. This means that with Dir-Sync, the External
Mail program is not occupied with delivering complete directories, nor
are you forced to manually send your address list to the other
postoffices when a single user is added or deleted.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>           GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF DIRECTORY SYNCHRONIZATION
           ================================================

</PRE>Dir-Sync is a method of propagating local postoffice address list
changes to other postoffices that are participating in the Dir-Sync
process. Dir-Sync is meant to be invisible to both administrators and
users; the changes are distributed automatically after the
administrator has configured Dir-Sync.
<P>
To accomplish synchronization, one postoffice is defined as the
directory server. This "server" postoffice maintains the master list
of all changes from the "requestor" postoffices. When a change is
made to a requestor's address list, the change is sent to the Dir-Sync
server, which incorporates the change into the master list and sends
updates to the requestors. These updates have only the changes a
postoffice needs to update its Global Address List (GAL).
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                           QUICK SETUP GUIDE
                           =================

</PRE>NOTE: For efficient and complete configuration of Dir-Sync, it is
highly recommended that you designate a global administrator, who has
access to all the postoffices. Although Dir-Sync does not require
this, it will make administration much easier.
<P>
To initialize Dir-Sync easily and quickly, complete the following nine
steps in the order listed:
<P>
<PRE>  NOTE: These steps are expanded below. Perform all the steps on the
  Dir-Sync server, and perform steps 1 and 5-9 on all the requestors.

   1. Ensure that mail can be sent between the postoffices.
   2. Designate one postoffice as the Dir-Sync server.
   3. Register all other postoffices as requestors with the server.
   4. Set up the server's process time.
   5. Register the server with all the other postoffices
      participating in Dir-Sync.
   6. Set up the two times for the requestors' processes.
   7. Export the user lists to the server by selecting Config, Dir-
      Sync, Requestor, Export (not External-Admin, Export).
   8. Turn on the Global Address List (GAL).
   9. Run the Dispatch program and run the External Mail program or a
      message transfer agent (MTA).

</PRE><P><LI>Ensure that mail can be sent from each postoffice to all other
   postoffices that will be participating in Dir-Sync, by sending
   mail from each postoffice's Administrator account to every other
   postoffice's Administrator account. This step is required because
   Dir-Sync uses the mail system to transfer the address list
   updates, so regular mail must be able to be sent and received
   before Dir-Sync will function.
<P>
   NOTE: Do not assume that because messages can go from one
   postoffice to another, the reverse is true. Be sure to test both
   sides of the connection before proceeding.

<P><LI>Decide which postoffice will be the Dir-Sync server. On that
   postoffice, run the Mail Administrator program and select Config,
   Dir-Sync, Options, Yes to make that postoffice the Dir-Sync
   server. There can only be one Dir-Sync server in your mail system.
   For more assistance in selecting the Dir-Sync server, see the
   Microsoft Mail "Administrator's Guide."

<P><LI>Select Config, Dir-Sync, Server, Requestors, Create to register
   each requestor postoffice on the server postoffice. These external
   postoffice definitions must have been created on the postoffice
   via External-Admin, Create before you register the requestor(s).
   You can leave the Requestor Password field blank; it is an extra
   security feature that is not related to any other password used by
   Mail. If you decide to use this password, the requestors must have
   the same password as well.

<P><LI>Select Config, Dir-Sync, Server, Schedule to schedule the time for
   the server to process the updates into the master list. For the
   Dir-Sync server only, skip step 5 and go to step 6.

<P><LI>For each requestor, select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor,
   Registration to designate the server postoffice. Specify the same
   postoffice that was designated in step 3 so that the requestor
   knows which postoffice to send the updates to. This external
   postoffice definition must have been created via External-Admin,
   Create before you can register it. If the Dir-Sync server has a
   password for the requestor's configuration, type the same password
   in the Requestor Password field (see step 3 above).
<P>
   NOTE: This step is not required for the Dir-Sync server; it is
   automatically registered when you perform step 2 above.

<P><LI>On each postoffice, run the Mail Administrator program and select
   Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Schedule to set the Send Requests and
   Process Updates times. The requestor sends updates to the server
   at the specified Send Requests time, and it processes updates
   coming from the server at the Process Updates time. Make sure the
   requestor sends its requests to the server prior to the server's
   scheduled time to process requests, and make sure the requestor
   processes updates after the server's scheduled time to send
   updates. Also, when setting the schedule for the requestor, add
   the additional time the MTA (such as the External Mail program or
   a gateway) needs to deliver the Dir-Sync mail. For more
   information, see the "Steps for Choosing Dir-Sync Times" section
   below.

<P><LI>Select Local-Admin, Modify and select the postoffice users who
   will be participating in Dir-Sync. When the option appears for
   participating in Dir-Sync, select Yes or No as appropriate. Then
   select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Export to send the address
   list to the server postoffice. The server will build the master
   list and send all the postoffice lists to the participating
   postoffices. This step is a "kick-start" to get the lists up to
   the server quickly.

<P><LI>Select Config, Global-List, Yes to enable the GAL.

<P><LI>To create the Dir-Sync mail and update the GAL automatically, the
   Dispatch and External Mail programs must be running and must be
   able to access each postoffice participating in Dir-Sync. The
   Dispatch program polls each postoffice. When the designated time
   for Dir-Sync to run has passed, the Dispatch program will create a
   mail message that contains the directory changes as an attachment.
   The External Mail program must be running on the requestor
   postoffice to move the Dir-Sync message into the proper outbound
   postoffice queue, then either the External Mail program or a
   gateway MTA can deliver the message from the requestor to the
   server postoffice. The Dispatch program creates the update
   message, but the External Mail program or MTA must deliver it.
<P>
</OL>You can run the Dispatch program and the External Mail program or MTA
on the same computer by using the Idle (-i) option of the Dispatch
program. By using the External MTA as the idle process, you can
deliver mail and perform Dir-Sync from one computer. The two
executables share time on the computer because the Dispatch program
starts the External Mail program with a Break Relative time. When the
External Mail program exits, the Dispatch program can poll the
requestors for Dir-Sync process times, and either run the Dir-Sync
processes or restart the External Mail program. For more information,
see the Microsoft Mail "Administrator's Guide."
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                   STEPS FOR CHOOSING DIR-SYNC TIMES
                   =================================

</PRE></OL>In general, setting the process times for Dir-Sync requires that you
analyze your network and determine how long it will take the Dispatch
program to cycle through the postoffices participating in Dir-Sync,
and how quickly the External Mail program or MTA can deliver mail
between postoffices.
<P>
To determine how long Dir-Sync will take on your network, start the
Administrator program and select Config, Dir-Sync. Then perform the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Configure the Send Requests and Process Updates times for all
   requestors so that they are four hours apart (for example, if the
   "Send Requests" time is 2 A.M., make the Process Updates time 6
   A.M.). To configure these times, select the Requestor Schedule
   option.

<P><LI>On the Dir-Sync server, set the Process Updates time halfway
   between the Send Requests and Process Updates times for the
   requestor (in this example, at 4 A.M.).
<P>
   NOTE: Process Updates for the server is not the same as Process
   Updates for the requestors. The former is located under Config,
   Dir-Sync, Server, Schedule; the latter under Config, Dir-Sync,
   Requestor, Schedule. Because of the identical names given the two
   distinct times, this is a point of confusion for many people.

<P><LI>Enable the SENT.LOG and RECV.LOG files by running the External
   Mail program with the -MS and -MR options.

<P><LI>Let the Dispatch program complete one cycle overnight.

<P><LI>Examine the DISPATCH.LOG file on the Dir-Sync server. Search for
   the line Running "NSDA -RT". This is the Send Requests time for
   the postoffice whose name is shown on the line directly above the
   "NSDA -RT" line. There will be two lines for each requestor
   postoffice. Record each time NSDA -RT runs.

<P><LI>Search for the line Running "NSDA -S". This is the server's
   Process Updates time and must occur only on the Dir-Sync server.
   Record this time.

<P><LI>Search for the lines Running "NSDA -RR". These are the Process
   Updates times for each requestor. Record this time for each
   requestor.

<P><LI>Examine the SENT.LOG and RECV.LOG files for $SYSTEM messages.
   These are the Dir-Sync updates being exchanged. For each
   postoffice, record the time the $SYSTEM message was transmitted to
   the Dir-Sync server, when the Dir-Sync server sent a reply
   message, and when the update was received by the requestor.

<P><LI>For the Dir-Sync server, each $SYSTEM message must arrive at the
   Dir-Sync server before the Process Updates time for the server.
   For each requestor, the $SYSTEM message must arrive before the
   Process Updates time for each requestor. If any of the messages do
   not satisfy these criteria, you need to adjust the Process Updates
   times.
<P>
</OL>Alternatively, run the Dispatch program for two cycles and then
examine the CENTRAL.LOG file. This log file contains the previous
status of Dir-Sync on each requestor. It is one cycle late because it
uses the status messages the requestors send to the Dir-Sync server,
and these messages are sent at the Send Requests time of the next
cycle; thus the CENTRAL.LOG file shows what happened in the previous
cycle. The benefits of this method are that each requestor is
summarized in a single location and you can easily view the Dir-Sync
times. The drawback is that the file is old, and, therefore, two
cycles of the Dispatch program are required.
<P>
For an example of the log files, see Appendix B of the Microsoft Mail
"Administrator's Guide."

<PRE>                      TYPICAL DIR-SYNC SCENARIOS
                      ==========================

</PRE></OL>This section is a guide for setting up an efficient Dir-Sync
configuration involving the postoffice, the MTA, and the Dispatch
program. In the following scenarios, assume that drive mappings start
with the Dir-Sync server at drive M, and that the Dispatch program and
the MTA are run from the same computer.
<P>
<PRE>   IMPORTANT: When a gateway is used to transfer the Dir-Sync
   messages, the External Mail program must be run in order to
   properly process the Dir-Sync messages. See "The Dir-Sync Process"
   section later in this Application Note for the technical reasons
   why the External Mail program is needed.

</PRE><h2>A. STANDARD CONFIGURATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following scenario shows multiple requestors sending directories
to the Dir-Sync server. The Dispatch program and the External MTA can
have direct access via LAN or WAN to each postoffice.
<P>
<PRE>  Server           Requestor 1
      \\              //
       \\            //
        \\          //
         ------------
         | External |
         ---------------
            | Dispatch |
            ------------
         //            \\
        //              \\
       //                \\
   Requestor 2      Requestor 3

</PRE>The command line for the computer running the Dispatch and External
Mail programs is:
<P>
<PRE>   dispatch -dmp -i"external -dmp -a"

</PRE>For Dispatch 3.2 and External 3.2, the corresponding .INI files are
included in the Appendix of this Application Note. The command line
for Dispatch 3.2 and External 3.2 is:
<P>
<PRE>   dispatch /instancename=Normal

</PRE>If you use a gateway as the MTA, this command line will change. See
the administrator's guide for the gateway you are using to determine
the best approach for running the Dispatch program and the gateway MTA
together. Also, it is important that you still run the External Mail
program to process the Dir-Sync messages.
<P>
<P><h2>B. DYNAMIC DRIVE MAPPING</h2>
 
<P>
In the following scenario, dynamic drive mappings connect Requestors 2
and 3 to the Dir-Sync server. Both the Dispatch and External programs
from Mail 3.0x use the same dynamic drive table, so any postoffice the
External Mail program delivers mail to should be included in Dir-Sync.
Mail 3.2 handles dynamic connections differently, and the Dispatch
program does not need to use the same Dynadmin table (although it can if
you want to use the same table).
<P>
<PRE>   Server           Requestor 1
      \\              //
       \\            //
        \\          //
         ------------
         | External |
         ---------------
            | Dispatch |
            ------------
          /            \
         /              \
        /                \
   Requestor 2      Requestor 3

</PRE>The command line for the computer running Dispatch and External is:
<P>
<PRE>   dispatch -dmn -f -i"external -dmn -fop -a"

</PRE>Note that the Dispatch program does not need to designate which drives
to use for the dynamic connections because it uses the first available
drive designation; however, the External Mail program does need this
information. Thus, the Dispatch program requires the -F option, while
the External Mail program requires -FOP (for example) to use drives O
through P for dynamic connections. This configuration is not possible
when you use a gateway as an MTA because gateways do not use dynamic
drives.
<P>
The corresponding .INI files for Dispatch 3.2 and External 3.2 are
included in the Appendix. For Dispatch 3.2 and External 3.2, the
command line is:
<P>
<PRE>   dispatch /instancename=Dynamic

</PRE><h2>C. MODEM CONNECTIONS</h2>
 
<P>
In the following scenario, modems are used to connect two networks.
Because the Dispatch program cannot run over the modem connection, two
copies of the Dispatch program must be running simultaneously.
Dispatch 1 controls the server and one requestor, while Dispatch 2
controls the other two requestors. Note that there is still only one
Dir-Sync server, not two.
<P>
<PRE>  Server           Requestor 1
      \\              //              ______
       \\            //              /modem \
        \\          //              /        \
         --------------            /      --------------
         | External 1 |           /       | External 2 |
         -----------------       /        -----------------
            | Dispatch 1 |      /            | Dispatch 2 |
            --------------     /             --------------
                     \        /             //            \\
                      \______/             //              \\
                       modem             //                \\
                                      Requestor 2      Requestor 3

</PRE>The command line for running Dispatch and the External MTA on both
networks is the same for both computers:
<P>
<PRE>   dispatch -dmn -i"external -dmn [&lt;any modem specific options&gt;]"

</PRE>The corresponding .INI files for Dispatch 3.2 and External 3.2 are
included in the Appendix. For Dispatch 3.2 and External 3.2, the
command line is:
<P>
<PRE>   dispatch /instancename=Modem

</PRE><h2>D. INDIRECT ROUTING</h2>
 
<P>
In the following routing, Requestor 3 is indirect via Requestor 2. As
with the modem connection scenario, the Dispatch program cannot
process the indirect postoffices unless the Dispatch program is
configured to connect directly to the requestor postoffice. In this
case, the routing of messages is indirect but the Dispatch program
processes the postoffice directly. If Dispatch 1 cannot reach
Requestor 3 (as in the diagram below), a second copy of the Dispatch
program must be running in order for Dir-Sync to work.
<P>
<PRE>  Server           Requestor 1
      \\              //

                      GATEWAY NAMES AND DIR-SYNC
                      ==========================

</PRE>You can use Dir-Sync to distribute gateway names to all the requestor
postoffices. However, this is not as simple to do as it is with Mail
postoffices.
<P>
To begin, each requestor postoffice must have either the gateway or
the access (also known as downstream) component of the gateway
installed. When this is done, use the Administrator program to accept
gateway addresses by selecting Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Types.
Normally, the Types option has only Microsoft Mail enabled, but
installing the gateway places the gateway type in the Types list with
that type set to No. Select the gateway and respond Yes; the gateway
names will be accepted by the requestor postoffice for inclusion in
the gateway address list and in the GAL.
<P>
At this point, the requestors will accept gateway names; however,
there is no process to get these names into the Dir-Sync cycle. There
are three ways to do this:

<UL><LI>Register the gateway on the Dir-Sync server as a requestor, then
   write an application that will send the gateway address changes to
   the Dir-Sync server. The format for Dir-Sync mail is published in"
   Directory Synchronization with Foreign Mail Systems", which is
   available from Microsoft Customer Service.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Manually generate a text file that contains the gateway address
   changes to be entered in Dir-Sync. Use the import format described
   in "The Import Utility" section of the Microsoft Mail
   "Administrator's Guide." On any requestor postoffice, run the
   Import utility as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -e -f&lt;filename&gt;
</PRE><P>
   The -E option makes the Import utility add the names in &lt;filename&gt;
   to the REQTRANS.GLB file instead of to the gateway address list,
   as would occur without the -E option. The next Dir-Sync cycle will
   take these names, as it does with regular Mail for PC Networks
   names, and send them to the Dir-Sync server and hence to the
   requestors.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Add the new names and delete the out-of-date names via the
   Administrator program's Gateway List menu, then extract the
   gateway address list by using the Import utility as follows
<P>
<P><PRE>      import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -x -g&lt;gatewaytype&gt; -f&lt;filename&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where -X specifies that Import is to extract addresses and -G
   specifies that gateway names defined under the &lt;gatewaytype&gt; are
   to be extracted. This list cannot be used by Dir-Sync without a
   slight modification, however. The list as generated contains all
   Add commands, and none of the Delete or Modify commands. To make
   this list usable so that the deleted names are deleted from the
   other postoffices and modified names are modified, you must add
   the following line at the beginning of the file to tell Dir-Sync
   to replace the existing gateway list with the new gateway list:
<P>
<P><PRE>      R &lt;gatewaytype&gt;:
</PRE><P>
   Note that some gateways (for example, PROFS(R)) need several such
   lines, one for each node. Once you add the Replace lines to the
   beginning of the gateway list, use the IMPORT -E line given above
   to send the file to the Dir-Sync server. You can easily
   incorporate this process into a batch file: create a file that
   contains the R command(s), copy this file to a temporary file, use
   Import to extract the gateway list to the temporary file, and then
   send the file to the Dir-Sync server. Therefore, the batch file
   would look like the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy start.txt temp.txt
      import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -x -g&lt;gatewaytype&gt; -ftemp.txt
      import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -e -ftemp.txt
      del temp.txt
</PRE><P>
</UL>Run this batch file before the time when the requestor postoffice
sends its updates to the server, or the gateway list will not be
incorporated into the GAL until the next Dir-Sync cycle is run.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                      MOVING THE DIR-SYNC SERVER
                      ==========================

</PRE>Moving the Dir-Sync server from one postoffice to another involves
several steps that maintain the database integrity:

<OL><P><LI>Select which postoffice will be the new Dir-Sync server
   postoffice.

<P><LI>If this postoffice is not registered as a requestor on the current
   Dir-Sync server, run the Administrator program on the current Dir-
   Sync server and register the new postoffice as a requestor.

<P><LI>Make the postoffice the new Dir-Sync server via the Administrator
   program, by selecting Config, Dir-Sync, Options, Yes.

<P><LI>Save a copy of the PROCESS.GLB file from the GLB directory on the
   new server postoffice. Copy the PROCESS.GLB file from the old Dir-
   Sync server to the GLB directory on the new server. This will
   maintain the current schedule of server processes. Alternatively,
   use the Administrator program and schedule the T2 time by
   selecting Config, Dir-Sync, Server, Schedule. If this postoffice
   has not participated in Dir-Sync, schedule the T1 and T3 times as
   well, under Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Schedule.

<P><LI>Copy the SRVCONF.GLB and MSTTRANS.GLB files from the current Dir-
   Sync server's GLB directory to the new server's GLB directory,
   overwriting the existing (new) files.

<P><LI>Turn off the old server via the Administrator program, by
   selecting Config, Dir-Sync, Options, No.

<P><LI>Copy the PROCESS.GLB file you saved in step 4 to the GLB directory
   of the old (inactive) server. This will ensure that no scheduled
   server processes will be remaining on the inactive server.

<P><LI>Compress the mailbags on the old (inactive) server via the
   Administrator program, by selecting Local-Admin, Storage,
   Compression. Check the size of the SYSTEM.MBG file on the inactive
   server. If it is not zero bytes, complete the following steps to
   clear out any Dir-Sync messages:
<P>
   a. Run the following MS-DOS command in the MBG directory:
<P>
<PRE>         type nul &gt; system.mbg

   b. Go to the KEY directory and run debug system.key. At the dash
      prompt, type the following and press ENTER after each line:

         F,100,L 230,0
         W
         Q

      This will flush out any Dir-Sync messages that did not get
      processed. Dir-Sync will recover from the missing messages as
      part of its fault tolerance.

</PRE><P><LI>Register the old server (now a requestor) with the new server, and
   change the registration of all the requestors to the new Dir-Sync
   server via the Administrator program, by selecting Config, Dir-
   Sync, Requestor, Registration.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>            AUTOMATICALLY CREATING POSTOFFICES VIA DIR-SYNC
            ===============================================

</PRE></OL>When Dir-Sync receives an address from a postoffice that isn't
currently defined on the requestor postoffice, Dir-Sync will
automatically create that postoffice. However, the Dir-Sync server
cannot do the same because the server must know the requestor's name
before it can accept address updates from that postoffice.
<P>
This feature is very handy for the administrator because the main
problem with adding postoffices is ensuring that the spelling is
correct. However, there is one caveat: Dir-Sync uses the same routing
for the automatically created postoffice as that used to route
messages to the Dir-Sync server. This may not be the correct routing
for the new postoffice. It is likely that the new postoffice is routed
differently, but you must correct the routing manually. Dir-Sync has no
foreknowledge of the structure of your mail system, so it uses the only
information it has when automatically creating a postoffice.
<P>
For example, if the Dir-Sync server's route is via a modem, all
automatically created postoffices will be routed via modem as well. If
the Dir-Sync server is routed indirectly via a hub postoffice, then all
automatically created postoffices will be routed indirectly via the same
hub postoffice.
<P>
Therefore, there are two scenarios where Autocreate will function
without your having to make any changes:

<UL><LI>All postoffices are routed directly. Because the Dir-Sync server
   is routed directly as well, the routing for all postoffices will
   be correct.

<LI>All postoffices are routed indirectly via a hub postoffice.
   Because the Dir-Sync server is routed indirectly as well, the
   requestor already knows that the hub postoffice is routed directly
   and the Dir-Sync server is routed indirectly. All other
   postoffices will be created as routing indirectly via the hub
   postoffice.
<P>
</UL>The optimal setup is to manually create all directly routed
postoffices (unless the first case above applies), route the Dir-Sync
server indirectly via a hub postoffice, and automatically create the
other indirectly routed postoffices via the hub postoffice.
<P>
NOTE: When a requestor's name is changed on the requestor and on the
Dir-Sync server, and autocreate Postoffice is enabled, duplicate
entries will be created in all the other requestors because Dir-Sync
does not know how to rename a postoffice. It will create the new
postoffice name without deleting the existing name, and will build a
GAL with duplicate entries. You must manually remove the obsolete
postoffice via External-Admin, Delete, or rename the postoffice via
External-Admin, Modify, prior to Dir-Sync processing the change.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                         THE TIMEZONE VARIABLE
                        ======================

</PRE>The TimeZone (TZ) variable is used to adjust the Dir-Sync times to
what the Dispatch computer is using. This sounds more awkward than
what actually happens. An example is the best approach to explaining
TZ:
<P>
Assume that the Dispatch computer is in St. Louis (the Central U.S.
time zone EST6) and that the postoffice is in Sydney, Australia (so
the time zone is aus14, since TZ considers locations west of Greenwich
to have positive time offsets). The format for the MS-DOS TZ environment
variable is SET TZ=&lt;xxx&gt;[-]&lt;nnyyy&gt;, where &lt;xxx&gt; is a
designation for the time zone (any three characters will work--they
are not checked for validity); &lt;nn&gt; is the time from Greenwich
calculated as the number of hours difference, where moving westward is
positive and eastward negative; and &lt;yyy&gt; is for daylight saving time;
and any character after the hours (&lt;nn&gt;) will adjust the time by one
hour.
<P>
When TZ is set, several MS-DOS time functions are updated to the
current time zone. When the administrator sets the Dir-Sync times, the
TZ variable is incorporated into the time written to the PROCESS.GLB
file. Dispatch reads this time and adjusts it according to the local TZ
variable on the computer running Dispatch. This time is used to schedule
Dir-Sync. Therefore, it is important that you set TZ on both the
computer running the Administrator program and on the computer running
the Dispatch program, or the correct offsets will not be used.
<P>
For example, let the time be 3 A.M. (03:00) in Australia. When the
Dispatch program reads the PROCESS.GLB file, it takes the set time
(03:00), adds the stored time zone (14) to convert to Universal Time,
then subtracts its own time zone (6) to convert the time into local
time. Thus the Dispatch program sees the process time as 03:00 + 14 -
6 = 11:00, and that is the local time when the Dir-Sync process will
be run in Australia. The time in Australia will still be 03:00.
<P>
When the administrator in Australia views the Dir-Sync schedule, the
time will be 03:00. If the administrator from the Dispatch machine
views the same schedule, the time will reflect the change in time zone
and so will be 11:00. This can be confusing to the administrators, but
it is perfectly normal behavior.
<P>
There are five scenarios that involve the TZ variable:

<UL><LI>All postoffices are in the same time zone, and the Administrator
   and Dispatch programs are run from this time zone. TZ is not
   needed.

<LI>Postoffices are in different time zones, but the Administrator and
   Dispatch programs are run from one time zone. TZ is not needed
   because the stored times are all using the same TZ offset.

<LI>Postoffices are in different time zones and the Administrator
   program is run from different time zones, but the Dispatch program
   is run in only one time zone. TZ is helpful in this setup because
   the offsets are calculated automatically. Set the TZ variable on
   the computer running the Administrator program and on the computer
   running Dispatch. If you are using Dispatch 3.0, set the TZ
   variable from the MS-DOS prompt. If you are running Dispatch 3.2,
   use the DISPATCH.INI file's TimeZone option.

<LI>Postoffices are in different time zones, and multiple copies of
   both the Administrator and Dispatch programs are run from
   different time zones. This scenario is awkward; TZ will not really
   help in this case because each copy of Dispatch will be reading
   TZ offsets, and there is no way to coordinate several Dispatches.

<LI>The Administrator program is run from one time zone, and Dispatch
   is run from another time zone. TZ will not help in this case:
   Dispatch will incorrectly adjust the time set by the Administrator
   program because Dispatch believes the postoffice is located in the
   same time zone as the Administrator program.
<P>
</UL>The alternative to TZ is to manually adjust the times for the
difference. If the time zones are close to one another (less than
three hours' difference), TZ may not be of help and manual
adjustment may be easier.
<P>
One situation that can cause difficulties (although it is not directly
related to the TimeZone variable) arises with daylight saving time
(DST). When Dispatch updates the time to run the next Dir-Sync process,
it does so by adding one week's worth of seconds to that day's time. It
maintains a complete weekly list of Dir-Sync times, along with the next
time to run, and simply copies the next time to run into the place for
the current time to run. The problem occurs when Dispatch runs a process
in the week before DST takes effect. When it adds the week's worth of
seconds, MS-DOS compensates for the impending arrival of DST by
interpreting the stored time to have one extra hour in it. Thus the time
recorded in the PROCESS.GLB is one hour greater than before. The
opposite is true when DST ends; the extra hour is removed.
<P>
Dispatch continues to add the week's worth of seconds, so the change
in time propagates until DST ends. This is NOT the fault of Dispatch.
It knows nothing about the change; it compares the time to run with
what MS-DOS reports. Because the two are off by one hour, Dir-Sync
occurs one hour later (or earlier, depending on DST) than expected.
<P>
The solution is simple: always set the TZ variable on the machine that
sets the process times (be it ADMIN.EXE or DSSCHED.EXE, described
below). When TZ is set, MS-DOS does not add the extra hour when DST
occurs. Note that you don't want to use SET TZ=PST8DST, or MS-DOS will
add the extra hour when the change to or from DST occurs. Therefore, the
three cases are:
<P>
<PRE>Command                            | Explanation
</PRE> 
<PRE>No TZ setting                      | Times are adjusted by 1 hour at
                                   | both the start and the end of
                                   | DST.
</PRE>SET TZ=&lt;xxxnnyour_local_time_zone&gt; | Times are not adjusted.
<PRE>SET TZ=&lt;xxxnn&gt;DST                  | Times are adjusted by 1 hour at

                                   | DST.


                         THE DIR-SYNC PROCESS
                         ====================

</PRE>Dir-Sync can be divided into four distinct times. Time 0 (T0) is when
the postoffice administrator uses the Administrator program to create
or modify a user or group that is participating in Dir-Sync, or when
Import is used to add names to the Dir-Sync process. When these
changes are made, a record is added to the REQTRANS.GLB file. The
REQTRANS.GLB file is the entry point for all Dir-Sync names.
<P>
Time 1 (T1) is the Send Updates time, when the requestors create mail
messages for the Dir-Sync server. These messages contain the status of
the requestor and any updates of the requestor's address list that are
sent to the server.
<P>
Time 2 (T2) is the Process Updates time for the server, when the
server takes all the updates from all the requestors, adds them to the
master transaction list, and creates mail messages that are sent to the
requestors with the updates each requestor needs to have an
updated GAL.
<P>
Time 3 (T3) is the Process Updates time for the requestors, when each
requestor takes the updates from the server and incorporates them into
its local GAL.
<P>
To ensure that a Dir-Sync process will not run long after it is
scheduled to (as would be the case if DISPATCH.EXE did not connect to
the postoffice for some reason, such as a server that is down), there
is a "window" of time in which the Dir-Sync process will be run, and
after which it will not. This is the run window for the process. For
version 3.0 of the Administrator program the run window is four hours,
and for version 3.2 of the Administrator program it is eight hours. If
this amount of time passes and Dispatch then connects to the postoffice
and reads the scheduled processes, a "&lt;Process name&gt;
missed its run window" error is generated and is placed in the
DISPATCH.LOG file (where &lt;Process Name&gt;is either NSDA -RR, NSDA -S, or
NSDA -RT, corresponding to T1, T2, and T3). When this error occurs, you
should determine if Dispatch could not connect to the server in
question, or if Dispatch is running out of time because it is running
Dir-Sync on too many postoffices. The first condition is temporary; the
second will occur frequently. The solution is to either have more copies
of Dispatch running on different sets of postoffices (so that only one
copy of Dispatch can perform Dir-Sync on a postoffice), or increase the
amount of time between T1, T2, and T3.
<P>
<PRE> In more detail, the exact steps Dir-Sync follows are:

</PRE><h2>TIME 1 (T1)</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>T1 steps are:</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Dispatch polls the PROCESS.GLB file at each postoffice to
   determine when to proceed with Dir-Sync.

<P><LI>When T1 has been reached or exceeded, dispatch spawns NSDA -RT.

<P><LI>The NSDA program in turn spawns REQMAIN -T to transmit the
   updates.

<P><LI>The REQMAIN program opens the REQCONF.GLB file to get the
   requestor's current synchronization numbers.

<P><LI>The REQMAIN program creates a mail message and an attachment,
   which contains the previous Dir-Sync status of the requestor, and
   places the message header in the P1 directory for the server.

<P><LI>The REQMAIN program reads the REQTRANS.GLB file to see if any
   additions or changes to the requestor's address list are waiting
   to be sent to the server.

<P><LI>The REQMAIN program creates a second mail message with the
   requestor's commands to the Dir-Sync server, creates an attachment
   to the message that contains the contents of the REQTRANS.GLB file
   (if any updates need to be sent to the Dir-Sync server), and
   places the message header in the P1 directory.

<P><LI>The REQMAIN program writes the status of the sent updates to the
   DIRSYNC.LOG file.
<P>
</OL>Because the mail messages for the server are in the P1 directory, the
External MTA must run to first move them into the mailbag for the Dir-
Sync server and then actually deliver them to the Dir-Sync server.
Because gateways do not use the P1 directory, External is required even
on postoffices that only use a gateway to communicate with other
Microsoft Mail postoffices. For assistance on how to properly use a
gateway as the MTA, contact Microsoft Product Support.
<P>
<P><h2>TIME 2 (T2)</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>T2 steps are:</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Dispatch polls the PROCESS.GLB file.

<P><LI>When T2 has been reached or exceeded, Dispatch spawns NSDA -S for
   the Dir-Sync server only.

<P><LI>The NSDA program spawns SRVMAIN -R to receive the updates.

<P><LI>The SRVMAIN program reads the Dir-Sync mail messages (the mailbag
   for the Dir-Sync mail is SYSTEM.MBG) and incorporates them into
   the MSTTRANS.GLB file. MSTTRANS.GLB is the master list of all
   updates that are sent to the Dir-Sync server. This list is
   routinely purged of old directory entries, which you configure via
   the Administrator program by selecting Config, Dir-Sync, Server,
   Options, Keep Updates.

<P><LI>After incorporating the updates into the MSTTRANS.GLB file,
   SRVMAIN updates the SRVCONF.GLB file to reflect the current status
   of the Dir-Sync process for each requestor.

<P><LI>The NSDA program spawns SRVMAIN -T to transmit updates to the
   requestors. Only those postoffices that send an update at the T1
   time (and were successfully received by the Dir-Sync server) are
   sent an update.

<P><LI>For each requestor, SRVMAIN reads the SRVCONF.GLB and MSTTRANS.GLB
   files and creates Dir-Sync messages that contain the entries in
   MSTTRANS.GLB that are numbered greater than the sync number stored
   in SRVCONF.GLB for that requestor. If templates are exchanged,
   SRVMAIN reads the various .TPL (template) and .INF (information)
   files and incorporates the information into the attachments.
   SRVMAIN places these messages, like the ones during T1, in the P1
   directory for later delivery to the requestors.
<P>
</OL>The External MTA is again required to transfer the Dir-Sync messages
from the P1 directory to the outbound queues for the requestor
postoffices and then to deliver the mail to the requestors.
<P>
<P><h2>TIME 3 (T3)</h2>
 
<P>
T3 is the most complex step in the entire Dir-Sync cycle. It is at T3
that the Dir-Sync updates are received and the GAL and the
GALINDEX.GLB file are rebuilt from scratch. This step is complex
because of the time required to rebuild the various files. For large
GALs (for example, more than 100,000 names), the rebuild process can
take several hours. Even for small GALs (about 10,000 names) the
rebuild process can take almost an hour to complete, depending on the
type of computer used to run the Dispatch program. The faster the
computer running Dispatch, the more quickly the process will complete.
<P>
<P><h3>T3 steps are:</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI> Dispatch polls the PROCESS.GLB file again.

<P><LI> When T3 has been reached or exceeded, Dispatch spawns NSDA -RR on
<P><PRE>    each postoffice.
</PRE>
<P><LI> NSDA in turn spawns REQMAIN -R to receive the updates.

<P><LI> REQMAIN reads the SYSTEM.MBG file for Dir-Sync mail, reads the
<P><PRE>    attachments and transfers the names to the SRVTRANS.GLB file, and
    then exits.
</PRE>
<P><LI> NSDA spawns the Import program to move the names in the
<P><PRE>    SRVTRANS.GLB file into the various .USR files (the address lists
    for each postoffice). The Import program does this by reading the
    SRVTRANS.GLB file and then sorting the names into three separate
    queues (USRTRANS.GLB, NMETRANS.GLB, and GWTRANS.GLB).
    USRTRANS.GLB holds names that are network/postoffice type names
    (SNADS, PROFS, OfficeVision(R)). NMETRANS.GLB holds Mail for PC
    Networks names that are to be deleted or modified. GWTRANS.GLB
    holds gateway names.
</PRE>
<P><LI> If template exchange is enabled, each postoffice template and
<P><PRE>    information file is modified. If templates are enabled but no
    templates have been sent to the requestor postoffice, a warning
    is generated that states there are no templates. This is a very
    common warning, but it is not critical to Dir-Sync.
</PRE>
<P><LI> The Import program combines the names from the temporary queues
<P><PRE>    and the templates into the .USR or .NME files. Then it clears the
    queues and exits.
</PRE>
<P><LI> NSDA spawns REBUILD -F.

<P><LI> Rebuild reads the local postoffice list (ADMIN.NME), each
<P><PRE>    gateway's NME list, the network list, and each external
    postoffice's USR list into a temporary GAL. This temporary file
    is sorted and a temporary GAL index is built. This step is by far
    the most time-consuming part of the process.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Rebuild deletes the old GAL and GAL index files, renames the
<P><PRE>    temporary GAL index to GALINDEX.GLB, and renames the temporary
    GAL to GAL.NME.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Rebuild places all external postoffice and gateway names in the
<P><PRE>    GALNETPO.GLB file. This file is used to speed up the time
    required to resolve an external name to a corresponding mailbag.

manual Dir-Sync cycle can accomplish this.
<P>
<PRE>   IMPORTANT: Manual Dir-Sync is intended as a debugging and
   verification procedure when problems with Dir-Sync are encountered
   or suspected, and NOT as the primary means for performing Dir-
   Sync. There are several internal error messages that are processed
   only by Dispatch, and a manual Dir-Sync cycle does not pass these
   error messages to the Administrator program or to MS-DOS.

</PRE>Manual Dir-Sync follows the same process as the Dispatch program
follows, so similar notation is used below.
<P>
Turn off all MTAs, if possible. Investigating the status of Dir-Sync
will be much easier if no External Mail programs or MTAs are running
during the manual Dir-Sync cycle.
<P>
Add or modify a user on each postoffice so you can follow the flow of
Dir-Sync mail from the requestors to the server and back again.

<OL><P><LI>On every postoffice involved in Dir-Sync, including the server
   postoffice, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      reqmain -t -d&lt;drive&gt;
</PRE><P>
   This step generates the outgoing Dir-Sync mail message and places
   it in the P1 directory.

<P><LI>On the computer that all the postoffices are mapped to, type the
   following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      external -0 -d&lt;driverange&gt;
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The -0 option is a zero, not the letter O.
<P>
   IMPORTANT: This step is required even if a gateway is used to
   deliver the mail because External is required to move the Dir-Sync
   message from the P1 directory to the outbound mailbag. Gateways do
   not examine the P1 directory, so Dir-Sync messages will be
   stranded and Dir-Sync will not take place without External.
<P>
   This step transfers the mail into the outbound queue for the Dir-
   Sync server. Use the Administrator program on each requestor
   postoffice to check the queue for the Dir-Sync server postoffice.
   There should be at least two $SYSTEM messages in the queue. One
   will be a status report, the other will have a subject line that
   looks like the following
<P>
<P><PRE>      $SYSTEM ReqTx R=R# (was r#), S = S#, I = I#  ## sent
</PRE><P>
   where:
<P>
<PRE>   Message     | Description
</PRE></OL> 
<PRE>   ReqTx       | Indicates this is the requestor update to the
               | Dir-Sync server.
   R=R#        | The current requestor sync number from REQTRANS.GLB.
   (was r#)    | The old requestor sync number from REQCONF.GLB.
   S=S#        | The requestor's server sync number from REQCONF.GLB.
   I=I#        | The number of imports requested to date from
               | REQCONF.GLB.
   ## sent     | The number of address updates contained in the
               | attachment.

   NOTE: If another External Mail program or MTA is still active, the
   mail may have been delivered before the queue was checked.

</PRE><P><LI>On the computer that all the postoffices are mapped to, type the
   following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      external -0 -d&lt;driverange&gt;
</PRE><P>
   This invocation of the External Mail program actually delivers the
   outgoing Dir-Sync mail. If you are using a gateway as the MTA,
   type the appropriate gateway command to deliver the message.

<P><LI>On the Dir-Sync server, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      nsda -s -d&lt;drive&gt;
</PRE><P>
   Alternatively, you can enter the two commands that comprise NSDA -
   S:
<P>
<P><PRE>      srvmain -r -d&lt;drive&gt;
      srvmain -t -d&lt;drive&gt;
</PRE><P>
   The SRVMAIN -R command receives the updates and places them in the
   MSTTRANS.GLB file. The SRVMAIN -T command reads the SRVCONF.GLB
   file, determines which updates need to be sent to each requestor
   postoffice, reads the MSTTRANS.GLB file to create the updates,
   generates a mail message back to each postoffice that sent a
   request to the server, and places this outgoing mail in the P1
   directory.

<P><LI>On the computer that all the postoffices are mapped to, type the
   following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      external -0 -d&lt;driverange&gt;
</PRE><P>
   This command again moves the mail to the outbound queues. The
   server's queues for the requestor postoffices should show the
   following $SYSTEM message
<P>
<P><PRE>      $SYSTEM SrvTx R=R# S=S# (was s#) I = I# ## sent
</PRE><P>
   where:
<P>
<P>

          | received by the server.
S=S#      | The new server sync number for the requestor.
</PRE>(was s#)  | The old server sync number for the requestor.
<PRE>I=I#      | The number of imports requested to date by the requestor.
## sent   | The number of updates sent back to the requestor.

</PRE><P><LI>On the computer that all the postoffices are mapped to, type the
   following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      external -0 -d&lt;driverange&gt;
</PRE><P>
   This delivers the updates to the requestor postoffices. If a
   gateway is used as the MTA, type the appropriate command to
   deliver the messages.

<P><LI>On every postoffice involved in Dir-Sync, type the following
   command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      reqmain -r -d&lt;drive&gt;
      import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -q -y -d&lt;drive&gt;
      rebuild -f -d&lt;drive&gt;
</PRE><P>
   The REQMAIN -R command receives the updates and moves them into
   the SRVTRANS.GLB file.
<P>
   The IMPORT command takes the SRVTRANS.GLB records and moves them
   into the temporary transaction files depending on what types of
   addresses they contain. Then the Import command moves the names
   into the .USR and .NME files. The -Q option tells Import to use
   the SRVTRANS.GLB file for the update, and the -Y option tells
   Import to run without asking for permission to continue.
<P>
   The REBUILD -F command takes the network names, the .NME files,
   and the .USR files to build the GAL and the GAL index file. The -F
   option is the same as the -Y option for import. This concludes the
   manual Dir-Sync cycle.
<P>
   It is important that you run all three commands on all postoffices
   participating in Dir-Sync, especially the Dir-Sync server, or
   errors may occur the next time Dispatch is run because of the Dir-
   Sync requests waiting to be processed.
<P>
</OL>Warning: If you run the Rebuild utility when Mail users are active,
Rebuild may fail with Error 203 because the GAL.NME file may be open for
address resolution at the time Rebuild is run. If this error occurs
under version 3.0 of the Rebuild utility, messages may be misdirected
because the GALINDEX.GLB file will not match the correct GAL.NME file.
With Mail 3.0, you should only perform manual Dir-Sync when users are
not signed in to Mail. Rebuild 3.2 uses a different algorithm to delete
the GAL files, and messages cannot be misdirected if Error 203 occurs.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                         THE DIR-SYNC PROTOCOL
                         =====================

</PRE></OL>Dir-Sync uses seven numbers in four files to control the updates sent
to a requestor postoffice. Both the requestor and the server have sets
of stored numbers. The requestor stores its copy of ReqSync (requestor
sequence number, also known as ReqSeq, which is the cumulative total of
all updates sent to the server) and SrvSync (server sequence number,
also known as SrvSeq, which is the cumulative total of all updates
received from the server) in the REQCONF.GLB file. The requestor also
stores the ReqSync number in the REQTRANS.GLB file. This copy of ReqSync
records the last update sent to the server, as well as any additional
changes since the last update. The ReqSync number in the REQTRANS.GLB
file must be equal to or greater than the ReqSync number stored in the
REQCONF.GLB file, or Dir-Sync will ignore the updates in the
REQTRANS.GLB file.
<P>
For the Dir-Sync server, the SRVCONF.GLB file stores Sync (the last
known position in the MSTTRANS.GLB file), and copies of ReqSync and
SrvSync for each requestor. Also, the MSTTRANS.GLB file stores
sequence numbers for each transaction sent to the Dir-Sync server.
<P>
The following table summarizes the important Dir-Sync numbers:
<P>
<PRE>Sync number      | Location             |Description
</PRE> 
<PRE>ReqSync          | Requestor:           | Cumulative total of all
                 | REQCONF.GLB          | updates sent to the server.
SrvSync          | Requestor:           | Cumulative total of all
                 | REQCONF.GLB          | updates received from the
                 |                      | server.
Transaction sync | Requestor:           | Individual sync numbers for
numbers          | REQTRANS.GLB         | each transaction waiting to
                 |                      | be sent to the server.
                 |                      | Always equal to or greater
                 |                      | than ReqSync.
Sync             | Server: SRVCONF.GLB  | Last known record position
                 |                      | in the MSTTRANS.GLB file.
ReqSync          | Server: SRVCONF.GLB  | Server copy of the
                 |                      | requestor's number of
                 |                      | updates. Used to
                 |                      | determine if the update
                 |                      | from the requestor is
                 |                      | valid.
SrvSync          | Server: SRVCONF.GLB  | Server copy of the
                 |                      | requestor's server updates.
                 |                      | Used as acknowledgment of
                 |                      | requestor's receipt of
                 |                      | updates.
Transaction sync | Server:              | Individual sync numbers for
numbers          | MSTTRANS.GLB         | each transaction. Used to
                 |                      | control which transactions
                 |                      | are sent to the requestors.

</PRE>One consequence of the protocol (and a very easy test of Dir-Sync's
status) is that the requestor's ReqSync number is always less than or
equal to SrvSync. This is because the sequence numbers are cumulative
totals: because more than one postoffice is (usually) involved in Dir-
Sync, more updates will be received by the requestors than are sent to
the server from any one requestor.
<P>
In explaining the protocol, the same terminology that describes the
Dir-Sync flow will be used, starting at time T0:
<P>
T0:
<P>
The administrator adds, deletes, or modifies a user, and includes the
change in Dir-Sync. The ReqSync stored in the REQTRANS.GLB file is
incremented, and the entry is added to the REQTRANS.GLB file.
<P>
T1:
<P>
The REQMAIN program reads the ReqSync number in the REQCONF.GLB file
and compares it to the numbers in the REQTRANS.GLB file. Any updates
that have sequence numbers less than that stored in the REQCONF.GLB
file are rejected as obsolete transactions. Any updates that have
sequence numbers greater than that stored in the REQCONF.GLB file are
placed in a mail message as an attachment, and the body of the message
contains the Dir-Sync transaction. The exact format of the Dir-Sync
message can be found in the "Directory Synchronization with Foreign Mail
Systems' manual.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: If you delete and then re-create the REQTRANS.GLB file, you
   must reset Dir-Sync on that postoffice so that the updates will be
   accepted. On a requestor, this is not difficult because the Dir-
   Sync utilities will reset the REQCONF.GLB file; however, for a
   server, this problem is very difficult to correct. In this case,
   it is best to call Microsoft Product Support Services for
   assistance.

</PRE>T2:
<P>
On the server, the incoming message is read and the sequence numbers
for the transactions are compared to the SRVCONF.GLB file's stored
sequence numbers. Any transactions that are numbered less than the
stored ReqSync number are rejected as old information, and the
remaining transactions are added to the MSTTRANS.GLB file. The Sync
number in the SRVCONF.GLB file is updated to reflect the new size of
the MSTTRANS.GLB file. These steps are done for each Dir-Sync message
sent to the server.
<P>
During the transmit stage of T2, the updates from the SrvSeq number
(sent in the requestor's message) to the Sync number (at the end of
the MSTTRANS.GLB file) are placed in an attachment, and the message is
sent as a reply to the requestor. The text of the message contains the
new SrvSync number (which is equal to the Sync number), and it also
echoes back to the requestor the ReqSync number sent to the server.
These new sequence numbers are stored in the SRVCONF.GLB file for the
next Dir-Sync cycle.
<P>
The implication of this method is that only those requestors whose
messages were received by the server by time T2 will receive an
update. Requestors whose messages were delayed will not receive an
update in the current Dir-Sync cycle, but will receive the updates in
the next Dir-Sync cycle.
<P>
If the requestor sends a message with ReqSync = 0 and SrvSync = 0, the
server assumes the requestor needs all address lists and generates an
Import Reply message. You can request an import by selecting Config,
Dir-Sync, Requestor, Import from the Administrator program. When the
server receives an Import Request message, the process is slightly
different. The server scans all of its current address lists, as well as
the MSTTRANS.GLB file, and sends these addresses to the requestor. This
has two major effects: 1) The Dir-Sync message sent to the requestor can
be very large, and 2) Any existing address list on the requestor
postoffice is replaced by the update.
<P>
NOTE: If the requestor Admin has created his or her own gateway
address list, and then sets that gateway type to Yes for Dir-Sync and
asks for an Import, the addresses will be lost when Dir-Sync replaces
the old list with the new list.
<P>
T3:
<P>
The requestor processes the updates in much the same manner as the
server processed its updates. The message is examined for the sequence
numbers. If the ReqSeq number in the message matches the ReqSync number
stored in the REQCONF.GLB file, the requestor knows the server received
its updates and processed them correctly. At that point, the
REQTRANS.GLB file is cleared of the old transactions and a dummy
transaction is placed at the last position, in order to keep the ReqSync
number current. The SrvSeq number is stored for the next Dir-Sync cycle,
so the server will be informed that the update was
received. The transactions are moved from the attachment to the
SRVTRANS.GLB file for further processing by the Import and Rebuild
utilities. These processes do not affect the sequence numbers, only
the address lists, so they will not be covered further in this
Application Note.
<P>
This protocol is fault-tolerant: the information (either the updates
themselves or the need for updates) is not changed until the
acknowledgment is received. Thus the requestor does not remove updates
until the server notifies it that the updates were received, and the
server does not delete updates until the requestor confirms it has
received them as well.
<P>
Foreign requestors work somewhat differently and are beyond the scope
of this Application Note. For more information, see the "Directory
Synchronization with Foreign Mail Systems" manual.

LISTQ for compatibility with earlier versions of the utility.
<P>
The -C option calculates the checksum for each Dir-Sync transaction in
the file and compares it to the stored checksum. If they do not match,
an error message is displayed. This option can be helpful when you are
looking for corrupt transactions in the file, but mainly it is in LISTQ
for compatibility with earlier versions of the utility.

                       TROUBLESHOOTING DIR-SYNC
                       ========================

</PRE>Troubleshooting Dir-Sync begins with examining the DIRSYNC.LOG and
DISPATCH.LOG files. The DIRSYNC.LOG file is located on each postoffice
and reflects the status of Dir-Sync on that postoffice only. The
DISPATCH.LOG file is located only on the Dir-Sync server and reflects
the status of all postoffices that have sent updates to the server.
<P>
In general, the log files can point you to any problems with Dir-Sync.
Microsoft Product Support Services will ask you to send them the log
files, so it is best to enable the DISPATCH.LOG file when you suspect a
problem with Dir-Sync.
<P>
<PRE>  NOTE: Because Dir-Sync is time and network dependent, it is
  important that you do not assume that Dir-Sync has failed if a
  requestor misses a cycle. Because Dir-Sync is fault-tolerant, any
  updates that are missed will be recovered in the next Dir-Sync
  cycle. You should only take preventative action if a problem
  persists across several Dir-Sync cycles.

</PRE>Several problems can arise with Dir-Sync; the following list of common
problems is designed to help you quickly troubleshoot and fix the
problem.
<P>
PROBLEM 1: THE GAL ON A POSTOFFICE DOES NOT
<P><h2>HAVE ALL OTHER POSTOFFICE ADDRESS LISTS</h2>
 
<P>
When updates are not being added to the GAL, you must troubleshoot the
Dir-Sync process to determine where the problem lies. Follow the
troubleshooting guidelines below to quickly isolate the problem. Be
sure to stop after each procedure to determine if the problem has been
solved. There is no need to do more work than necessary!

<OL><P><LI>Verify that no problems exist with the general Dir-Sync process
<P>
   Open the Administrator accounts on the server postoffice and the
   requestor postoffices to see if any error messages have been sent
   to you. If an error message stating "requestor not registered" is
   present, verify that the server is registered with the requestor
   and vice versa. Other error messages may indicate a temporary
   condition that will be corrected by continuing with these
   troubleshooting steps.
<P>
   Enable the log files for Dir-Sync if this is not done already.
   Examine the CENTRAL.LOG (on the Dir-Sync server only) and
   DIRSYNC.LOG files for the status of Dir-Sync on all the requestor
   postoffices. Verify that each postoffice is participating in Dir-
   Sync, that updates are being sent and received, and that the GAL
   is being rebuilt. If these steps are not occurring on a
   postoffice, verify that Dispatch can reach the postoffice and that
   the External Mail program or MTA can deliver mail to it from the
   server postoffice. Examine the DISPATCH.LOG file to verify that
   NSDA -RT and NSDA -RR complete successfully on the requestors, and
   that NSDA -S completes successfully on the server. Verify that the
   time for the requestor's NSDA -RT is before the server's NSDA -S,
   and that the requestor's NSDA -RR is after the server's NSDA -S.
   Be sure to allow time for the External Mail program or MTA to
   transfer the Dir-Sync messages between the requestors and the
   server.
<P>
   Determine which postoffices do not have the full GAL:
<P>
   a. If a single requestor postoffice does not have all other
<P><PRE>      postoffice address lists, run the Administrator program on that
      postoffice and select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Import to
      have the server send down the complete list of addresses. Note
      that this replaces all address lists on the requestor with the
      ones from the server, including gateway lists. If the local
      administrator has created a special Fax address list and the
      server has its own Fax list, and the requestor last asked for
      Fax updates, then the requestor's Fax list will be deleted and
      will be replaced by the server's list.
</PRE><P>
   b. If the server does not have the complete address list,
<P><PRE>      determine which requestor postoffice is not in the server's
      list. From the Administrator program on that requestor
      postoffice, select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Export to send
      the address list to the server.
</PRE><P>
   c. If the requestors don't have a single postoffice's address
<P><PRE>      list, run the Administrator program on the missing postoffice
      and select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Export to send the
      address list to the Dir-Sync server.
</PRE><P>
   d. On all postoffices, delete these temporary files if they are
<P><PRE>      present in the GLB directory: IGWTRANS.GLB, INMETRAN.GLB,
      IUSRTRAN.GLB, SRVUPDS.GLB, REQUPDS.GLB, and any SORT&lt;xxxx&gt;
      files, where &lt;xxxx&gt; is a number. Verify that SRVTRANS.GLB,
      GWTRANS.GLB, NMETRANS.GLB, and USRTRANS.GLB are zero bytes in
      length. If not, truncate these files by deleting the file(s)
      and running the following MS-DOS command
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         type nul &gt; &lt;filename&gt;

      where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file to be truncated.

   Wait for Dispatch to run the Dir-Sync cycle. If this does not
   clear up the problem, the sync numbers may be invalid.

</PRE><P><LI>Reset the requestor sync numbers
<P>
   If step 1 is unsuccessful, one of the requestor postoffices may be
   out of sync. Examine the ReqSync numbers on the requestor by
   running LISTDS -R and LISTQ -FREQTRANS. If the ReqSync number in
   the REQCONF.GLB file is greater than the one in the REQTRANS.GLB
   file, reset the requestor's ReqSync numbers by performing the
   following steps:
<P>
   a. To reset the sync numbers on the requestor postoffices,
<P><PRE>      generate the RESYNC.GLB file. On the server postoffice, run the
      following command:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -s -d&lt;drive&gt;

      This will create a file in the server postoffice's GLB
      directory called RESYNC.GLB.

   b. Copy this RESYNC.GLB file to the postoffices that do not have
      the full GAL, and delete it from the server postoffice
      (otherwise, Import will generate an error message when it tries
      to process the file on the server).

   c. On the requestor postoffices that contain the RESYNC.GLB file,
      run the following commands:

         import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -q -y -d&lt;drive&gt;
         rebuild -f -d&lt;drive&gt;

      Import looks for the RESYNC.GLB file and processes it before
      any other Dir-Sync mail. The RESYNC.GLB file contains new sync
      numbers for the requestor that reflect what the server has
      recorded in the SRVCONF.GLB file. This will clear any sync
      number conflicts.

   Wait for the Dispatch program to run the Dir-Sync cycle. The sync
   numbers should be correct now and Dir-Sync will proceed on that
   postoffice. Occasionally, the RESYNC.GLB file will not reset the
   sync numbers. If this occurs, create a zero-length REQTRANS.GLB
   file by typing the following MS-DOS command in the GLB directory:

      type nul &gt; reqtrans.glb

   Regenerate the RESYNC.GLB file, move it to the requestor's GLB
   directory, and wait an additional Dir-Sync cycle. If this step
   still does not correct the problem, you may need to reset the Dir-
   Sync files.

</PRE><P><LI>Reset the Dir-Sync files
<P>
   If the RESYNC.GLB file is unsuccessful in resetting the ReqSync
   numbers, use the LISTDS utility to reset the REQCONF.GLB file by
   following the steps below. These steps collectively are called a
   "local reset."
<P>
  CAUTION: Do not perform this procedure on the Dir-Sync server--you
  will not be able to recover from the damage to the server's
  REQCONF.GLB file! If the Dir-Sync server (acting as a requestor) is
  not being propagated, proceed to the global reset section below.
<P>
   On the server:
<P>
   a. Delete the requestor record. From the Administrator program,
<P><PRE>      select Config, Dir-Sync, Server, Requestors, Delete, and select
      the requestor postoffice.
</PRE><P>
   b. Re-create the same requestor postoffice. This will reset that
<P><PRE>      postoffice's record in the SRVCONF.GLB file.
</PRE><P>
   On the requestor:
<P>
   c. Reset the REQCONF.GLB file by running the following command:
<P>
<PRE>         listds admin -p&lt;password&gt; -d&lt;drive&gt; -r -z

   d. Verify that the REQCONF.GLB file is reset by running the
      following command:

         listds admin -p&lt;password&gt; -d&lt;drive&gt; -r

      The ReqSync and SrvSync numbers should both be zero (0).

   e. Reset the types of names propagated by Dir-Sync by selecting
      Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Types. This step is necessary only
      if gateways are installed and gateway names are included in
      Dir-Sync.

      If you use an older version of the LISTDS utility, the Dir-Sync
      server's name will be reset as well. If this is so, reregister
      the Dir-Sync server by selecting Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor,
      Registration.

   f. Select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Export to reexport the
      address list. If confirmation is requested, respond Yes.

   g. Wait for the Dispatch program to carry out the Dir-Sync cycle.

   If the server postoffice must be reset, or if Dir-Sync is not
   working for all postoffices involved, a "global reset" may be
   needed. This should only be done after the previous
   troubleshooting steps have been performed, and only after
   consultation with Microsoft Product Support Services. This
   procedure entails a substantial amount of work on the Dir-Sync
   administrator's part that may be unnecessary if one of the above
   procedures fixes the problem.

   On the server postoffice:

   a. From the Administrator program, select Config, Dir-Sync,
      Options, No, and reply Yes to the warning. This step deletes
      the SRVCONF.GLB and MSTTRANS.GLB files from the server. Once
      you complete this step, you must complete all the other steps
      below.

   b. Reset the REQCONF.GLB file on the Dir-Sync server by running
      the following command:

         listds admin -p&lt;password&gt; -dm -r -z

   c. Verify that the REQCONF.GLB file is reset properly by running
      the following command:

         listds admin -p&lt;password&gt; -dm -r

       The ReqSync and SrvSync numbers should both be zero (0).

   d. Enable the Dir-Sync server by running the Administrator program
      and selecting Config, Dir-Sync, Options, Yes.

   e. Select Config, Dir-Sync, Server, Requestors, Create to redefine
      all the requestors.

   f. Select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Types to reset the types of
      names propagated by Dir-Sync. This step is only necessary if
      gateways are installed and gateway names are included in Dir-
      Sync.

   g. Select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Export to send the list to
      the other postoffices.

   On each requestor postoffice:

   h. Reset the REQCONF.GLB file by running the following command:

         listds admin -p&lt;password&gt; -dm -r -z

   i. Verify that the REQCONF.GLB file is reset properly by running
      the following command:

         listds admin -p&lt;password&gt; -dm -r

      The ReqSync and SrvSync numbers should both be zero (0).

   j. Select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Types to reset the types of
      names propagated by Dir-Sync. This step is only necessary if
      gateways are installed and gateway names are included in Dir-
      Sync.

      If you use an older version of the LISTDS utility, the Dir-Sync
      server's name will be reset as well. If this is so, reregister
      the Dir-Sync server by selecting Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor,
      Registration.

   k. Select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Export, to send the list to
      the other postoffices.

</PRE></OL>Now all the Dir-Sync files will be reset. Wait for Dispatch to
complete the Dir-Sync cycle.
<P>
PROBLEM 2: NAMES IN GAL WHEN
<P><h2>ADMINISTRATOR HAS SPECIFIED NOT TO INCLUDE THEM</h2>
 
<P>
The most common cause of this problem is when External-Admin, Export
is selected from the Administrator program. This command places a
complete address list, regardless of any Dir-Sync settings, in the
other postoffice's .USR file for that postoffice. Dir-Sync reads this
file as part of the T3 step and the names will be in the GAL. To
restore the GAL, go to the postoffice whose names are incorrect, run
the Administrator program and select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor,
Export. After the next Dir-Sync cycle, the GAL will contain the
correct names. If this procedure is unsuccessful, perform a Config,
Dir-Sync, Requestor, Import on the requestors that have the bad
address list.
<P>
PROBLEM 3: FATAL ERROR 161: SERVER
<P><h2>CONFIGURATION BUSY ON A REQUESTOR POSTOFFICE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when a server postoffice was turned into a requestor
while Dir-Sync mail was still waiting to be processed, or when a
requestor sends Dir-Sync updates to another requestor. Although the
message states this is a fatal error, the Dir-Sync process is fine.
<P>
To clear the error from the requestor postoffice:

<OL><P><LI>Set the SYSTEM.MBG file to zero bytes by running the following
   command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      type nul &gt; m:\mbg\system.mbg
</PRE>
<P><LI>Clear the SYSTEM.KEY file by running the DEBUG utility:
<P>
<P><PRE>      debug m:\key\system.key
</PRE><P>
   At the hyphen (-) prompt, type the following and press ENTER after
   each line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      -F, 100,L 230, 0
      -W
      -Q
</PRE><P>
</OL>This may not be sufficient to clear the problem if the requestor was
once a server. The PROCESS.GLB file may contain a deferred server
process time. Check the DIRSYNC.LOG file on the requestor postoffice
for an error of "NSDA -S missed its run window." If this occurs, reset
the PROCESS.GLB file by running the DSSCHED utility:
<P>
<PRE>   dssched admin -p&lt;password&gt; -dm -xfile.txt

</PRE></OL>Examine FILE.TXT and delete any T2 entries, then import the file back
to the postoffice:
<P>
<PRE>   dssched admin -p&lt;password&gt; -dm -ifile.txt

</PRE><h2>PROBLEM 4: ERROR 203: GAL REBUILD PROBLEM ACCESSING FILES</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when the GAL.NME or GALINDEX.GLB file is locked open
and the Rebuild utility attempts to replace it with the updated GAL.
Unlock these files and run the Rebuild utility to restore the GAL. This
must be done as soon as the error occurs; otherwise, one of the files
may be replaced but not the other, which will lead to
misdirected mail.
<P>
One cause of the GAL.NME file being held open is that the Windows
client is running with MSSFS.DLL version 4046 through 4061. These
versions of MSSFS.DLL resolved a problem with duplicate names in the
Personal Address Book; however, this fix resulted in the GAL.NME file
being held open after sending mail to an external user. Version 4062
of the DLL fixes this problem. To find the version number, run MSD 2.0
or later and press ALT+F, Find File, and search the Windows SYSTEM
subdirectory for the MSSFS.DLL file. The version number is displayed as
3.2.0.&lt;xxxx&gt;.
<P>
Because Mail can find older versions of the DLL and use them, this
problem can reoccur. To resolve the problem of MSSFS.DLL holding open
the GAL.NME file, all Windows clients must have MSSFS.DLL version 4062
placed in their Windows SYSTEM subdirectory and all other versions of
MSSFS.DLL must be deleted from the workstation.
<P>
PROBLEM 5: DIR-SYNC REPORTS "REQUESTOR NOT REGISTERED,"
<P><h2>YET THE REQUESTOR IS THE DIR-SYNC SERVER</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when version 3.2 or earlier of the Administrator
program corrupts the SRVCONF.GLB file. This corruption occurs only on
workstations with certain network cards (notably, NE2000's and
EtherExpress(TM) 16's). Another symptom of this problem is when the
SRVCONF.GLB file does not grow by 1K after another requestor is added.
<P>
Versions 3.2.2 and later of the Administrator program do not corrupt
the file, but they also do not fix the file. To add the server as a
requestor, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Go to another postoffice, run the Administrator program, and make
   the postoffice a temporary Dir-Sync server by selecting Config,
   Dir-Sync, Options, Yes.

<P><LI>Exit the Administrator program and go to the real Dir-Sync server.
   Copy the SRVCONF.GLB file from the real Dir-Sync server's GLB
   directory to the temporary Dir-Sync server's GLB directory.

<P><LI>Run the Administrator program again and register the real Dir-Sync
   server with the temporary Dir-Sync server, by selecting Config,
   Dir-Sync, Requestor, Registration.

<P><LI>Exit the Administrator program and copy the SRVCONF.GLB file from
   the temporary server to the real Dir-Sync server's GLB directory.

<P><LI>Run the Administrator program again on the temporary server and
   make it a requestor, then register the real Dir-Sync server on it.

<P><LI>Let Dir-Sync cycle.
<P>
</OL><h2>PROBLEM 6: ERRORS 157 AND 161 TOGETHER</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs only with certain network cards and network
protocols, most often with EtherExpress 16's with the Ethernet_II
protocol. This problem relates to corruption in the SRVCONF.GLB file
caused by version 3.0.4 or earlier of the SRVMAIN utility. To verify
the problem, run the LISTDS utility:
<P>
<PRE>   listds admin -p&lt;password&gt; -dm -s

</PRE></OL>If the SRVCONF.GLB file is corrupt, LISTDS will alert you to the
problem. At this point, call Microsoft Product Support Services for
assistance because the circumstances of the corruption must be
identified and eliminated before Dir-Sync can be performed
successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>PROBLEM 7: ERROR 133 INVALID SERVER REQUEST</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when the server is running the NSDA -S process at
time T2, but there is a T3 ReqTx message waiting to be processed. The
most likely cause of this problem is an incomplete manual Dir-Sync
cycle. The second most likely cause is incorrect times for T1 and T2.
To resolve the problem, you must reset the SYSTEM.KEY and SYSTEM.MBG
files as described in Problem 3 above.
<P>
<P><h2>PROBLEM 8: ERROR 150</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur for several reasons: corrupt files, lack of
disk space, or improper access rights to the postoffice.
<P>
To determine if corrupt files are the cause, ensure that the
USRTRANS.GLB, NMETRANS.GLB, and GWTRANS.GLB files in the GLB directory
are zero (0) bytes in length. If any are not zero bytes, run the
following MS-DOS command to set them to zero bytes:
<P>
<PRE>   type nul &gt; &lt;filename&gt;

</PRE>Ensure also that the IUSRTRAN.GLB, INMETRAN.GLB, IGWTRANS.GLB,
REQUPDS.GLB, and SRVUPDS.GLB files are not present in the GLB
directory. These are temporary files that should not normally exist if
Dir-Sync is not active on that postoffice.
<P>
Space problems can be harder to find, especially on Novell(R)
networks, because the amount of free space is misleading. Novell saves
files that are deleted and this space is not reported as used, but
REQMAIN can return the Error 150 when the "true" amount of free
space is too low. As a rule of thumb, Dir-Sync can use up to three
times the amount of disk space than what the update size is, for all
the temporary files that are created during the REQMAIN process. To
recover enough space for REQMAIN, run the PURGE command on the Novell
server and permanently remove all deleted files.
<P>
Proper access rights for the account that Dispatch uses to access
servers must allow for Read, Write, Create, and Delete rights on all
directories and subdirectories of the postoffice. For Novell servers,
the rights are RWCEM; for UNIX, the permissions on the entire
directory structure should be world, group, and user rwx.
<P>
<P><h2>PROBLEM 9: DIR-SYNC SERVER RESTORED FROM BACKUP COPY</h2>
 
<P>
When the Dir-Sync server is restored from a backup copy that does not
contain the latest Dir-Sync cycle, problems arise because the
SRVCONF.GLB file (where the requestor's status is stored on the
server) does not match the requestor's stored information (in the
REQCONF.GLB file). Worse still, the sync numbers in SRVCONF.GLB are
less than the sync numbers on the requestors, and the MSTTRANS.GLB
file does not have the updates that occurred later than the backup.
When SRVMAIN -R is processed, the current updates from the requestors
are processed successfully; however, when SRVMAIN -T occurs, the
server attempts to send updates numbered from SrvSync to Sync, and
these updates don't exist in the MSTTRANS.GLB file. Thus the server
reports two error messages, Fatal 138 and Fatal 139, that together
report the missing sync number. Normally, a missing sync number is not a
problem because the requestor's SrvSync number is less than the
lowest position in the MSTTRANS.GLB file, and the server can send the
updates available. With the requestor's SrvSync number greater than
the maximum in the MSTTRANS.GLB file, the server cannot send any
updates to the requestor, and so the requestor receives no updates
until its SrvSync number is less than the maximum in the MSTTRANS.GLB
file. If the disparity in numbers is large (for example, the backup is
an old one), address updates will not be received by the requestor for a
long time, and when they are received, there will be missing
transactions that were never sent.
<P>
To update Dir-Sync with the new configuration, run the Administrator
program and select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Export on each
requestor postoffice. Let Dir-Sync cycle to completion, then run the
Import utility to generate a RESYNC.GLB file by running the following
MS-DOS command:
<P>
<PRE>   import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -ddrive -s -y

</PRE>Then copy the RESYNC.GLB file from the Dir-Sync server's GLB directory
to all the requestors' GLB directories, delete the RESYNC.GLB file from
the server's GLB directory, and run Import to process the updates:
<P>
<PRE>   import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -ddrive -q -y

</PRE>This will update the address lists and update the REQTRANS.GLB and
REQCONF.GLB Dir-Sync configuration files, and Dir-Sync will operate
properly.

                               ========

Directory           The automatic process of transferring address
synchronization     lists from one postoffice to another
(Dir-Sync)          postoffice.

Dispatch            The program that controls the Dir-Sync
                    process.

External            The program that delivers mail between
                    postoffices.

GAL                 See "Global Address List."

GAL.NME             The actual file for the GAL. This file is in
                    the NME subdirectory of the Mail database.

GALINDEX.GLB        The index to the GAL. This file is meant to
                    decrease the time that the GAL is searched for
                    a name. It is located in the GLB directory of
                    the Mail database.

GALNETPO.GLB        The list of all external user addresses added
                    in the Dir-Sync process.

</PRE>Global Address List The single address list containing all
<PRE>(GAL)               addresses participating in Dir-Sync.

Import              A utility that allows for batch processing of
                    user and gateway names. It is used to
                    incorporate gateway names into the Dir-Sync
                    cycle.

Message transfer    The External Mail program or a gateway that
agent (MTA)         delivers mail from one postoffice to another.

MSTTRANS.GLB        The master list of all addresses that are
                    participating in Dir-Sync. It is maintained by
                    the Dir-Sync server postoffice.

MTA                 See "message transfer agent."

NSDA                Name Service Directory agent. It is spawned by
                    the Dispatch program to run the appropriate
                    step of the Dir-Sync cycle.

PROCESS.GLB         The storage file for the times defined in the
                    Administrator program for Dir-Sync to send,
                    process, and receive updates to the GAL.

Rebuild             The utility that re-creates the GAL from the
                    local postoffice list, external postoffice
                    lists, and gateway name files.

REQCONF.GLB         The requestor configuration record file.

REQMAIN             The primary requestor process. It creates and
                    receives mail messages that contain the
                    updates to the GAL.

REQTRANS.GLB        The requestor transaction file. It contains a
                    record of the current updates that need to be
                    sent to the Dir-Sync server for incorporation
                    into the MSTTRANS.GLB file and the external
                    postoffice GALs.

Requestor           A postoffice that sends and receives Dir-Sync
                    requests but does not maintain the master Dir-
                    Sync files.

Server              A postoffice that sends, receives, and
                    maintains the database of address lists.

SRVCONF.GLB         The server configuration record file.

SRVMAIN             The server process. It accepts the updates
                    from the requestors, maintains the
                    MSTTRANS.GLB file, and creates mail messages
                    containing updates to the requestors' GALs.

SRVTRANS.GLB        The server transaction file. It is a temporary
                    storage place on all requestors and is used in
                    the processing of updates from the Dir-Sync
                    server.

SYSTEM.MBG          The mailbag that receives the Dir-Sync mail
                    messages.
