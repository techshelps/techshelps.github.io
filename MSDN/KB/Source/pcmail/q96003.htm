<P><h2>Directory Synchronization Error and Status Messages #60 - 118</h2>
 
<P>
On Microsoft Mail for PC Networks version 3.0 Server Disk 1, there is a
file called DIRSYNC.TXT that contains the error codes used in directory
synchronization (Dir-Sync) and in the IMPORT utility for Mail. The errors
are logged in the DIRSYNC.LOG file.
<P>
<PRE>[60]    Using direct routing for autocreated postoffice
   This is an information message. Because the Import utility is
   running from the directory server postoffice, the routing for the
   new postoffice will be direct via an MS-DOS drive. On any other
   postoffice, the autocreate feature creates a new postoffice that
   has the same routing that the current postoffice uses to reach the
   directory server postoffice.

[61]    No template information defined for postoffice
   The postoffice for which you are extracting addresses does not have
   any template information. To get the template information, run the
   Administrator program, set Config Dir-Sync Requestor Options
   Templates Receive to Yes and then submit an Import request to the
   directory server postoffice by selecting Config Dir-Sync Requestor
   Import. Or you can get the template information from the
   administrator of the external postoffice, manually insert it into
   the import file and then run Import to insert the information into
   your postoffice's data files.

[62]    Replace option failed
   Try the operation again. Then check that there is still a
   connection to the server and ensure that there is enough disk space
   to perform the operation. If the problem continues, one of the data
   files may be locked open. Contact your network vendor to determine
   how to find and close locked files.

[63]    Resync extract failed
   Try the operation again. Then check that there is still a
   connection to the server. If the problem continues, one of the data
   files may be locked open. Contact your network vendor to determine
   how to find and close locked files.

[64]    Reserved network name
   The network name of the postoffice you tried to create with
   Import's -C autocreate option or with the Administrator program
   requestor Create-PO option is a reserved name. Select another
   network name.

[65]    No template defined for postoffice
   You are trying to import users with template information to a
   postoffice that has no template defined.

[66]    Local postoffice transaction ignored
   The Import utility does create local users. Use the Administrator
   program Local-Admin commands to define users at your local
   postoffice. All lines in the import file that contain transactions
   for local users will be ignored.

[67]    Resync extract can be performed only at a Directory Synchronization
        Server
   You can run the Import utility with the -s and -st options at the
   directory server postoffice only.

[68]    Network name already in use
   The network name of the postoffice you tried to create with the -C
   autocreate option already exists. Select another network name.

[69]    Alphanumeric characters only allowed in network name
   Only letters and numbers are allowed in network names.

[70]    Alphanumeric characters only allowed in postoffice name
   Only letters and numbers are allowed in postoffice names.

[71]    Alphanumeric characters only allowed in mailbox name
   Only letters and numbers are allowed in mailbox names.

[72]    Fullname is too long
   Check the import file for at least one alias (fullname) that
   exceeds 30 characters.

[73]    Template option not set, template information will be ignored
   The Import utility cannot import template information. Ensure that
   the Dir-Sync Requestor Options Templates Receive command in the
   Administrator program is set to Yes, or if you use Import as a
   stand-alone utility, run the utility with the -T command line
   option.

[74]    FAX recipient address field too long
   Check the import file for fax addresses that are too long. The
   maximum length of the recipient field in a fax address is 30
   characters. The four fax address fields must be in the following
   order: recipient, location, company, and phone number. The fields
   are separated by tildes (~).

[75]    FAX location address field too long
   Check the import file for fax addresses that are too long. The
   maximum length of the location field in a fax address is 30
   characters. The four fax address fields must be in the following
   order: recipient, location, company, and phone number. The fields
   are separated by tildes (~).

[76]    FAX company address field too long
   Check the import file for fax addresses that are too long. The
   maximum length of the company field in a fax address is 30
   characters. The four fax address fields must be in the following
   order: recipient, location, company, and phone number. The fields
   are separated by tildes (~).

[77]    FAX phone number address field too long
   Check the import file for fax addresses that are too long. The
   maximum length of the phone number field in a fax address is 22
   characters. The four fax address fields must be in the following
   order: recipient, location, company, and phone number. The fields
   are separated by tildes (~).

[78]    Out of file handles
   Ensure that the CONFIG.SYS file has FILES=20 (minimum). If the
   error continues, increase this number.

[79]    Out of disk
   There is not enough disk space to run the program. Increase the
   available disk space before continuing.

[80]    Out of memory
   Ensure that you are running the program on a computer with at least
   640K of memory.

[81]    No mailbox name
   Ensure the *.XTN files exist, are correct, and are not
   corrupt.

[82]    Local user information not allowed for this address type
   Check the import file to ensure local user profile information does
   not exist for an externally defined user.

</PRE>[83]   Invalid local user token value:
<P>
<PRE>[84]    Invalid local user token:

[85]    Unable to create local user:

[86]    Unable to delete local user:

[87]    Maximum number of local users has been reached

[88]    Invalid token assignment:

[89]    Truncating password to 8 characters:

</PRE>[90]   Transaction not processed
<P>
<PRE>[91]    The mail database is locked by another process:
   Check to make sure the FLAG.GLB file is not locked open.

[92]    Can't modify local user to external:

[93]    ACCESS tokens ignored for admin user:

[100]   Coding is incomplete

[101]   Begin execution

[102]   End process

[103]   Could not parse value

[104]   Requestor process failed

[105]   ReqRx received n updates

[106]   ReqTx send n updates

[107]   No more records

[108]   Error getting next record

[109]   Error getting first record

[110]   Failed to read the last transaction
   Wait at least one synchronization cycle and try the operation
   again. If the problem continues, copy a backup of the MSTTRANS.GLB
   file. Then ask all requestors to export their address lists.

[113]   Failure to send mail to
   Ensure that there is still a connection to the server. Also ensure
   that there is sufficient disk space to receive the mail. Wait at
   least one directory synchronization cycle and try the operation
   again. If the problem continues, contact Microsoft Product Support
   Services.

[114]   Failure to delete a message
   Ensure that there is still a connection to the server and try the
   operation again. If the problem continues, contact Microsoft
   Product Support Services.

[115]   Failure to read mail from
   Ensure that the computer running the Dispatch program has 640K of
   memory and that FILES=20 (minimum) in the CONFIG.SYS file. If the
   problem continues, contact Microsoft Product Support Services.

[116]   Attachment is missing or is empty
   Check that the foreign requestor did not forget to send an
   attachment with the system message. If the requestor did send the
   attachment, wait at least one synchronization cycle as the problem
   will most likely clear up on its own.

[118]   Transaction limit reached
   See message 166.
