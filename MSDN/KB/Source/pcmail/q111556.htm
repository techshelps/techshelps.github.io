<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2 and 3.2a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides a replacement for the Import Mail program file that
is included with versions 3.2 and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.
<P>
For complete information about obtaining and installing the Import Mail
program file, see the following sections:

<UL><LI>To download the updated file
<LI>To update your IMPORT.EXE file
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This update contains the Import Mail program (IMPORT.EXE), a
replacement for the Import Mail program file that is included with
versions 3.2 and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This update
resolves the following problems:

<UL><LI>The Import utility (with the -A option) no longer adds invalid DGN
   names to the Postoffice Address List (POL) when those names do not
   appear in the normal .USR files.

<LI>The Import utility no longer corrupts the MCI.NME file when
   importing MCI user names. This problem caused the Mail
   Administrator program to incorrectly display the MCI address
   information.

<LI>The Import utility no longer stops responding (hangs) when it
   processes RESYNC.GLB after doing heavy processing.
<P>
   NOTE: To resolve this problem, two .EXE files must be updated: the
   IMPORT.EXE file (update included in IMPORT.EXE version 3.2.9) and
   the SRVMAIN.EXE file (update included in SRVMAIN.EXE version 3.2.10).

<LI>The Import utility now updates FLAG.GLB when it runs, causing the
   External Mail program to update its address lists on the next cycle
   interval.

<LI>The Import utility no longer does 1-byte reads of the template
   files.

<LI>When it is importing modified SNADS template information, the
   Import utility no longer incorrectly sequences the information.

<LI>When you use the Import utility to modify a user's configuration
   (any option set with an "&amp;") and that user has remote access, the
   user's remote access ability is no longer removed.

<LI>When you use the Modify transaction type to update a user in the
   POL but you do not make any changes to the user's alias, the user's
   record is no longer deleted.

<LI>When you use the -A command-line option to modify template
   information, the Import utility no longer increases the size of the
   associated .INF file on each pass. The Import utility now creates a
   new .INF file that incorporates the changes rather than appending
   the changes to the existing .INF file.

<LI>When you use the Import utility to change a user's mailbox name,
   Error 34--"Could not access log information file"--no longer occurs
   when you start the MS-DOS client.

<LI>Deleting a local user with Import no longer leaves the user's
   folder files (.IDX and .FLD) orphaned in the FOLDERS\LOC\0000????
   subdirectory of the Mail database.

<LI>A Microsoft Mail Connection 3.2 PROXYNET\PROXYPO postoffice address
   list is now propagated to a downstream requestor postoffice when
   the gateway postoffice is also the directory server postoffice. The
   Import utility now copies FFAPI postoffice address lists from the
   directory server to the GLB\RESYNC.GLB file to perform a directory
   synchronization manual import procedure.
<P>
   NOTE: To resolve this problem, two .EXE files must be updated: the
   IMPORT.EXE file (included in this update) and the SRVMAIN.EXE file
   (update included in SRVMAIN.EXE version 3.2.10).

<LI>Local postoffice users added with the Import utility will no longer
   be assigned an invalid identification number if the TID.GLB file is
   locked open. Also, batch creation of local postoffice users with
   the Import utility while the TID.GLB file is locked open no longer
   results in the same invalid identification number being assigned to
   multiple users.

<LI>Trap D errors or "An OS/2 program caused a protection violation"
   error no longer occurs under OS/2 or under the OS/2 subsystem of
   Windows NT when you use the Import utility with the -ST command-
   line option.

<LI>The Import utility now creates unique mailbag numbers when you add
   local postoffice users, even if the CONTROL.GLB file has been reset
   to zero.

<LI>When you use Import to add a new local user, the Import utility now
   adds that user's template information to the REQTRANS.GLB. Previously,
   even if the template information was included in the IMPORT.TXT file,
   it was not written to the REQTRANS.GLB.

<LI>When you use Import to create a new template for an external postoffice,
   the Macintosh client can now read the template information after the
   first user. Previously, the last field was not visible for any user, and
   the template information for the second and subsequent users would
   display incorrectly.

<LI>When you use Import version 3.2.14 or 3.2.16, and you add users via
   an Import batch file, these users can have their TID values reset.
   This will create problems sending mail, adding to groups, and deleting
   users.

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online
               Services

</PRE>After you download IMPUPD.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing
"impupd" at the MS-DOS command prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   IMPORT.EXE (204,675 bytes, dated 5-3-95, 6:02 P.M.)
   README.TXT

</PRE><h3>To update your IMPORT.EXE file</h3>
 
<P>
At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<PRE>   copy &lt;drive&gt;:\import.exe &lt;destination&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
extracting IMPUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and
directory where your IMPORT.EXE file currently resides. For example,
if you ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D,
and the IMPORT.EXE file is located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C,
type the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   copy d:\test\import.exe c:\mailexe

</PRE>NOTE: The IMPORT.EXE file typically resides on the postoffice
server in the Mail executables directory as well as on the machine
importing addresses into the database. Make sure you update all
copies of the IMPORT.EXE file.
