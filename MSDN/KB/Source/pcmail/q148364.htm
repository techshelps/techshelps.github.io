The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, and 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides more information about the ending process of Rebuild
and the entries that go into the DIRSYNC.LOG. These log messages
are similar to the following:
<P>
07/31/95 05:03:10 | Status  Microsoft(R) mail GAL Rebuild Utility V.3.2.16
<PRE>07/31/95 05:05:18 | Status  Number of entries in GAL:     954
</PRE>07/31/95 05:06:45 | Status
<P>
The last two entries and the processes that take place between them are of
particular interest. When errors occur in these processes, the third status
line may not appear.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Number of Entries in GAL: message is created after a temporary Global
Address List (GAL) has been created. The number recorded as the number of
entries in the GAL is derived from a TMP0000x.NME file (the x will be a
number determined by the Rebuild program). The same file is later renamed
to GAL.NME, as long as the subsequent processes are successful. The GAL.NME
is renamed just prior to the blank status line being written to the log.
<P>
If the renaming of TMP0000x.NME to GAL.NME fails, Rebuild will try to
rename TMP0000x.NME to GAL$.NME.
<P>
After it gives this message, Rebuild starts on the creation of the
Galindex file. During this process failures can occur that are not
reported in the log. The following two types of failures cause the status
line to not be displayed.

<UL><LI>Failure writing to file GALTMP.GLB

<LI>Failure writing to file GALINDE$.GLB
<P>
</UL>If either of these failures occur, the renaming of GAL files is not
tried, and no final status line message appears in the log. The
TMP0000x.NME file will still be in the NME directory, and the GALTMP.GLB
file is deleted.
<P>
If Rebuild is being run on a Microsoft Windows NT workstation, the
following registry entry can reduce the occurrence of this problem:
<P>
HKey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\
Parameters\CacheFileTimeout=0
<P>
Notes:

<UL><LI>Use Add Value (not add key).
<LI>Change the data type to REG_DWORD (default is REG_SZ).
<LI>Reboot the machine.
<P>
</UL>The failures to write to the files can also be caused by a lack of disk
space on the server or network problems.
<P>
Generally, Rebuild failures will result in Fatal error messages being
recorded in the Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) log.
