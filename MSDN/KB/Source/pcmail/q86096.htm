The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
This article lists and explains all the entries in the Microsoft Mail
for Windows private profile, MSMAIL.INI, that are contained in the
[Custom Messages] section.
<P>
[Custom Messages]
<P>
This section may contain any number of entries of complicated form,
similar in many ways to the custom command section. Each entry
specifies a custom message type that is installed into a Mail menu at
run time. This section may appear both in the usual location MSMAIL.INI
in your Windows directory and in SHARED.INI in the directory pointed
to by the SharedExtensionsDir entry of MSMAIL.INI. Here are a synopsis
and a couple of examples of the custom message entry format; a
description of each sub field follows. Each entry must occupy a single
line. Many subfields are optional.
<P>
class=version;menu;name;position;DLL name;command;operation map;status
text;help file;help context;
<P>
<PRE>   class           A string uniquely identifying the message type.
                   Mail places this string in messages, and calls
                   custom message DLLs based on its value.

   version         Identifies the version of Mail with which the
                   custom message is compatible; 3.2 is the current
                   version.

   menu            Names the menu to which the compose command for the
                   message type should be added, such as File or Mail.

   name            The command name that is to appear on the menu. As
                   usual, you may include an ampersand (&amp;) just before
                   the letter that is to serve as an ALT-key
                   accelerator.

   position        The zero-relative position within its menu at which
                   the command should appear. -1 places the command at
                   the end of the menu.

   DLL name        Name or path of the DLL in which the custom command
                   resides.

   command         Command string passed as one of the parameters to
                   the DLL entry point for the command.

   operation map   Sequence of up to 16 digits. Each can be 0, 1, or
                   2. 0 indicates that Mail should perform its
                   standard operation on the custom message. 1
                   indicates that the DLL should be called to handle
                   the operation. 2 indicates that the operation
                   should be completely disabled. Currently eight
                   operations are defined; the rest are reserved and
                   must be zero. In the following list, 0 is the
                   leftmost digit:

                   0  Compose (menu command defined in this entry)
                   1  File.Open
                   2  Mail.Reply
                   3  Mail.Reply to All
                   4  Mail.Forward
                   5  File.Print
                   6  File.Save as
                   7  arrival of new mail

   status text     Text to be displayed in the Mail status bar when
                   the user cursors to the command in the menu.

   help file       Windows Help file to be invoked when the user
                   presses F1 while the command is selected. Passed
                   to the Windows Help program.

   help context    Passed to the Windows Help program along with the
                   Help file name. Use -1 (Help file index) if there
                   is no specific entry in the Help file for this
                   command.

</PRE>A more detailed description of custom message creation and
installation can be found in the Microsoft Mail "Technical Reference."
