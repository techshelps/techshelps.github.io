The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
This article describes error messages produced by the Microsoft LAN
Manager and Novell Extract utilities that are packaged with version
3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.
<P>
<P><h3>LAN Manager Extract Utility</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft LAN Manager Extract utility (LMEXT.EXE) can produce the
following error messages:
<P>
Error 2: Not enough memory to complete the process.
<P>
<PRE>   There is not enough RAM for the program to complete. This error
   rarely occurs because the application does not require much memory.
   Free up additional memory and rerun the application.

</PRE>Error 3: Failed to access output file.
<P>
<PRE>   The program could not open the specified output file. Make sure the
   filename is a valid MS-DOS filename, and there is sufficient disk
   space available (about 1K should be enough). Also, make sure the
   specified file is not set to read-only or hidden.

</PRE>Error 50: The network request is not supported.
<P>
<PRE>   The named server does not support the user accounts subsystem
   service requested. The likely cause of this error is that the
   server is not using user-level security or that the user accounts
   subsystem service has not been started.

</PRE>Error 53: The network path was not found.
<P>
<PRE>   The program could not find or access the named server. Check the
   validity of the server and make sure sufficient access rights are
   assigned. To confirm the server, issue the LAN Manager NET VIEW
   command.

</PRE>Error 2138: The workstation service is not started.
<P>
<PRE>   You are trying to run the program on a machine where the LAN
   Manager Workstation service has not been started. To resolve this
   problem, start the Workstation service by issuing the NET START
   WORKSTATION command.

</PRE>Error 234: Additional data is available but could not be retrieved.
<P>
<PRE>   There was not enough memory to retrieve all the data the user
   accounts subsystem could supply. This error commonly occurs when
   there are more than 600 users defined on the server.

</PRE>Error nnnn:  The process was unable to complete.
<P>
<PRE>   An unspecified error has occurred. Check to verify that the
   command-line parameters are correct and retry the process.

</PRE><h3>Novell Extract Utility</h3>
 
<P>
The Novell Extract utility (NOVEXT.EXE) can produce the following
error messages:
<P>
Error 3: Failed to access output file.
<P>
<PRE>   The program could not access the specified output file. Make sure
   the filename is a valid MS-DOS filename, and that there is
   sufficient disk space available (about 1K should be enough). Also,
   make sure the specified file's attributes are not set to read-only
   or hidden.

</PRE>Error 4: The process was unable to access the NetWare server.
<P>
<PRE>   This error occurs when you run the Extract program but you are not
   attached to a NetWare server.

</PRE>Error 5: The process encountered an error while accessing the NetWare
Bindery.
<P>
<PRE>   The process was unable to extract the user names from the NetWare
   Bindery.
</PRE>
