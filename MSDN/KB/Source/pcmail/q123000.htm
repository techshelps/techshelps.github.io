The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2, and 3.2a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There is no way to control the exact typeface selected when you print from
Microsoft Mail for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you view message text on your screen, you can switch between two
fonts, known as Fixed Font and Normal Font. To change these fonts, you
change the FixedFont and NormalFont settings in the [Microsoft Mail]
section of the MSMAIL.INI file. For more information about the [Microsoft
Mail] section of the MSMAIL.INI file, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q86100.htm">Q86100</A></B>
   TITLE     : PC Win: MSMAIL.INI Entries in [Microsoft Mail]

</PRE>When the message is printed, if Normal Font is the current view, Mail will
print a typeface named "Helv," regardless of the Normal Font specified in
the MSMAIL.INI file. If Fixed Font is the current view, a typeface named
"MSMAIL3" will be printed, regardless of the Fixed Font specified in the
MSMAIL.INI file. You can change the size of the printed text by changing
the PrintFont setting in the [Microsoft Mail] section of the MSMAIL.INI
file.
<P>
Messages printed from two different workstations may produce printing that
appears to have a different typeface because there is no Helv font
installed in Windows version 3.1 or later.
<P>
Since Helv does not exist, Windows tries to select a similar typeface. The
final typeface selected may vary based on the following criteria:

<UL><LI>The printer driver installed under Windows
<LI>Additional fonts installed under Windows
<LI>Third-party font manager products installed under Windows
<P>
</UL>With Windows 3.1 and Mail 3.2 installed and no additional fonts or font
manager products, messages printed with the Normal Font selected will vary
based upon the printer driver. For example, assume that a Hewlett-Packard
LaserJet III printer with PostScript is installed. If a message is printed
using the LaserJet HPCL driver, Univers will be the typeface used. If the
same message is printed using the PostScript driver, Helvetica will be
used.
<P>
If additional fonts are installed onto the system, Windows may find a
closer match to Helv, based on information in the font itself. If this
happens, output may appear different than Helvetica or Univers. If the
characteristics of the selected font are not correct, the printed text may
appear drastically different. The only way to prevent this type of problem
is to remove the offending font from the system.
<P>
If a third-party font manager is installed on the system, it may be able to
bypass Windows' own process to select the print typeface. To determine if
this is occurring, you need to temporarily deactivate or remove the font
manager.
<P>
NOTE: You can force a particular typeface to be selected for display by
changing settings in the [Font Substitution] section of the WIN.INI file.
However, this will not have any effect on the process of selecting a
printer typeface.
