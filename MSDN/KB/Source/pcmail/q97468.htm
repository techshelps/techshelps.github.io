<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use headers for mail retrieval with version 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail Remote for Windows, the messages listed show only mailbox names,
not friendly names. This makes choosing which messages to download
difficult if you are looking for messages from known senders.
<P>
It is not possible to get the friendly name from the message header.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Shared File System (SFS) transport never looks up the
friendly names because they are already contained in the message. As a
result, there is no support to look up a mailbox entry and return the
friendly name associated with that mailbox.
<P>
To provide this, the headers dialog would have to search all the
entries in the appropriate address directories and check to see if the
given mailbox is in the list and then return the associated friendly
name. Because of the time required to search, it is not appropriate
for relatively slow telephone/modem connections.
<P>
It could not be guaranteed to work on all addresses because messages coming
through gateways may not have entries in any of the address directories
(that is, the Global Address List (GAL), local postoffice or Personal
Address Book (PAB)), but they may still have a friendly name in message
header somewhere.
<P>
It is not possible to get the friendly name without the mail item
itself. Mail cannot do a look-up of the friendly name because mailbox
IDs are unique only within the same postoffice, and we do not know which
postoffice the mail header came from.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.2
of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
