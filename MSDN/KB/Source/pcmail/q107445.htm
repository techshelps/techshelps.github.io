The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides a replacement for the X400GATE.EXE file that is included
with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400. The replacement file
corrects a number of problems in the original X400GATE.EXE file.
<P>
For complete information about obtaining and installing the X400GATE.EXE
file, see the following sections:

<UL><LI>To download the updated file
<LI>To replace your X.400 executable files
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This replacement file corrects the following problems:

<UL><LI>Characters with diacritical marks (accents) are improperly encoded.

<LI>The encoded information type (EIT) for ISO-6937 is improperly
   encoded.

<LI>The gateway does not update the RECV.LOG file for messages received
   by the gateway.

<LI>The gateway hangs if the subject line contains enough spaces (ASCII
   32D or 20H) after the subject text to cause the total length to be
   74 or more characters.

<LI>The gateway hangs if a user forwards or replies to a message that
   was previously returned by the X.400 gateway (usually because of a
   bad address). This forward or reply message adds characters to the
   subject line, changing the total length to 74 or more characters,
   with spaces in the seventy-fourth and following positions.

<LI>The gateway tp4 stack incorrectly replies to a recovery packet and
   displays "ERROR: Pconnect..."

<LI>The gateway hangs after it processes two messages that have large
   distribution lists.

<LI>The gateway generates an "ERROR 58" message when it transmits mail
   or attachments to an ISODE Openpath user, even though the user
   successfully receives the message.

<LI>The gateway generates invalid minor synchronization points, causing
   an "ERROR 3." If debug mode is used, the error "DEBUG (tp4_recv):
   connection x: tp_receive() failed" occurs.

<LI>The gateway begins to create nondelivery reports. If the External
   Mail program tries to deliver these reports, the following error
   occurs in the SYSTEM.LOG file: "Message was not delivered: routing
   file was corrupted."

<LI>The gateway generates a free-form name longer than the 64 character
   limit specified in NIST, causing the message to be rejected by the
   receiving message transfer agent (MTA).

<LI>The gateway runs out of memory when you use ISO6937 as message body
   text. The gateway then misplaces subsequent messages, reporting the
   error "ERROR 3 (AttachP2): ISO6937 conversion failed."

<LI>If the gateway is configured to use a checkpoint size of 10, it may
   display the error "DEBUG (T4 SEND): CONNECTION 32: TP SEND()
   FAILED: 3." It then will not process any more messages.

<LI>If a large (4000 or more names) custom address map exists, the gateway
   may process messages slowly.

<LI>Read receipts and delivery notifications may be sent to the incorrect
   address by Softswitch EMX if the unique identifier the Microsoft Mail
   Gateway to X.400 places on each message is not unique.

<LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 does not successfully extract outbound
   mail from .MAI files.

<LI>Incoming nondelivery reports may cause the following error:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ERROR 4 (converting X.400 delivery report): Decoding X.400 Message

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online
               Services

</PRE>After you download X400GA.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing
"x400ga" at the MS-DOS command prompt) to extract the contents of the
file. You should receive the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   X400GATE.EXE (515,860 bytes, dated 04/18/95, 9:04 A.M.)
   README.TXT     (5,714 bytes, dated 10/28/94, 8:30 P.M.)
   XREAD.TXT

</PRE>(The README.TXT file included with this update is a revised version of the
readme shipped on the gateway disk.)
<P>
<P><h3>To replace your X.400 executable file</h3>
 
<P>
At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<PRE>   copy &lt;path&gt;\x400gate.exe &lt;destination&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
extracting X400GA.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and
directory where your X.400 executable files currently reside. For
example, if the X.400 executable files are located in the MAILEXE
directory on drive C and you ran the self-extracting file from the
TEST directory on drive D, type the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   copy d:\test\x400gate.exe c:\mailexe

</PRE>NOTE: The X400GATE.EXE file typically resides on the postoffice
server in the Mail executables directory as well as on the machine
where the gateway is running. Make sure all copies are updated
appropriately.
