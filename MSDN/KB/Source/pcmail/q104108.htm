The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.1, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.1, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows,
messages received with the same time stamp do not get sorted correctly:
they appear in a folder in the order they were placed in it and are not
sorted automatically by their From field.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The messages are inserted into the folder in the order they are received.
Mail does not sort them until you open the folder. If your primary sort
key is the Received field, and all the time stamps are the same, the
messages appear to Mail to already be sorted and Mail does not re-sort
them. As a result, the messages appear in their original, unsorted order.
<P>
The problem is that Mail pays attention only to date, hour, and minute
when sorting, not seconds, and it does not automatically do a secondary
sort by the From field.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Click the From field to force mail to sort based on that column, and
then click the Received field again. This causes messages in the folder
with the same time stamp to be sorted alphabetically.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.1,
and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
