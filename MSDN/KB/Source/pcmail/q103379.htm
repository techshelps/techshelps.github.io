<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0 and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
Using versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, you can
create groups on one postoffice (PO) that span multiple postoffices.
There are several different ways to do this, depending on the level of
detail you want available to the users. This article describes two
scenarios.
<P>
<P><h3>Configuration Information</h3>
 
<P>
PO1 has 20 users whose names begin with A (Adam,Andy,Alex,Ann,...).
PO2 has 20 users whose names begin with B (Bob,Brad,Bret,Barb,...).
PO3 has 20 users whose names begin with C (Carl,Cary,Chris,Carol,...).
<P>
All three postoffices are connected via the External Mail program and
form the entire Mail system.
<P>
<P><h3>Scenario 1</h3>
 
<P>
The ABC company wants each postoffice to have a group name that, when
selected, allows mail to be sent to everyone in the company. To set up
this scenario so that the least amount of maintenance is needed, do
the following:

<OL><P><LI>Create a group on each postoffice titled "All PO# Users," where #
   is the postoffice number. Each group should contain 20 members and
   should contain ALL local users, but NO external users.

<P><LI>Export updated address lists among all postoffices (or let the
   directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) cycle complete).
<P>
   NOTE: If a group only contains users on the local postoffice, it
   can participate in Dir-Sync.

<P><LI>From the Administrator program on each postoffice, merge the two
   group names from the other postoffices into the local postoffice
   address list (POL) using the Address, Create command.

<P><LI>Create an "All Users at ABC Company" group on EACH postoffice. The
   group should contain all 20 local users (the same users as in step
   1 above) AND the 2 "All PO# Users" group names from the other 2
   postoffices (22 names in all).
<P>
   Notes:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Once the groups in step 4 have been created, you should not
      export the address list again. Doing so will create duplicate
      group names on the Global Address List (GAL).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Because this group will contain two external addresses, it will
      not participate in Dir-Sync.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>General Notes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Whenever a new user is added to a local postoffice, the
   administrator of that postoffice should add the new user to both
   the All PO# Users group and the All Users at ABC Company group on
   the local postoffice.

<LI>Details on the members of the groups at the external postoffices
   will not be available from the local postoffice.
<P>
</UL><h3>Scenario 2</h3>
 
<P>
Andy, Alex, Ann, Brad, Bret, Barb, Cary, Chris, and Carol are working
on a new project for the ABC company. They want to set up a group name
on each postoffice that all their users will use to submit
project-related mail. This way, all project members will be kept
abreast of any changes or developing problems.

<OL><P><LI>From the Administrator program on each postoffice, use the Address,
   Create command to merge six addresses from the other postoffices
   into the local postoffice address list. The addresses to merge are
   the individual project members located on each of the other two
   postoffices.

<P><LI>Create a "Hot Project" group on EACH postoffice containing the
   three local project members and the six merged addresses of the
   external project members.
<P>
</OL><h3>Notes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Any external address merged into a local postoffice address list is
   like a snapshot in that it only captures one moment in time. Any
   changes made at the external postoffice (even with Dir-Sync or
   address exporting) will not be reflected in the merged address. All
   changes will require manual administration.

<LI>Because all group members have been individually merged into the
   local postoffice address list, all details will be available for
   the "Hot Project" group.
<P>
