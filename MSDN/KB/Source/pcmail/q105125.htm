The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
With versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, an
external address that was defined on the local postoffice may be
missing from the external postoffice address list (POL).
<P>
This problem may occur if the external address was defined on the
local postoffice by using the External-Admin, List function in the
Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE). If the address does not exist
on the directory synchronization server, the address will disappear
only after you do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Run the Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Import command
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Create a RESYNC.GLB file via IMPORT.EXE and copy this file to the
   requestor postoffice, followed by a complete directory
   synchronization (Dir-Sync) cycle.
<P>
</UL>Again, this problem only occurs if that external address name is not
already defined on the Dir-Sync server postoffice. This will be true
of all external postoffices and all gateway names, if the gateway type
is selected for Dir-Sync under Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Types for
the requestor.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) Config, Dir-Sync,
Requestor, Import command instructs the Dir-Sync server to send its
own complete set of address lists to the requestor. This information
is then used to build new address files containing only the address
information that existed on the Dir-Sync server. Therefore, Dir-Sync
will remove any addresses that were added to that external
postoffice's or gateway's address list via the local administrator.
<P>
Creating the RESYNC.GLB file has the same result as using the Config,
Dir-Sync, Requestor, Import command, except that the RESYNC.GLB file
is copied manually to the requestor postoffice. The effect is the
same; however, the address files are rebuilt from scratch, and the
locally defined external addresses or gateway addresses are lost.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
After the Dir-Sync cycle has completed, use ADMIN.EXE to add the
missing address to the external address list or the gateway list of
the requestor. Do this after you run each Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor,
Import command and after each RESYNC.GLB file has been processed. To
place this external address name into the Global Address List (GAL),
REBUILD.EXE must be run after the name has been added to the external
address list or the gateway list.
<P>
It may be advantageous to add the address to the directory
synchronization server's external address list as well, to prevent
this problem from occurring. However, the address will be propagated
to all of the requestors whenever the Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor,
Import command is run.
