<LI>Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, and you attempt to
switch between the Windows client and the Remote client, the System
Selector may fail with the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   The mail driver could not be deactivated because the file
   C:\windows\system\xxxxxxxx.xxx could not be found.

</PRE>where xxxxxxxx.xxx is one or more of the Mail client components referenced
in the following section of the FILES.INI file for the currently active
client:
<P>
<PRE>   [Transport]
   FILES=

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem occurs because the file that the System Selector is attempting
to deactivate is in a directory other than WINDOWS\SYSTEM (typically in the
WINDOWS directory). The System Selector fails because the file is not at
the expected location.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
When you activate a Mail client with the System Selector, the mail client's
DLLs and other files are moved to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. The
previously active client's DLL and other files are moved to the
WINDOWS\MSMAIL\PROVIDER directory.
<P>
NOTE: The PROVIDER is a placeholder for the specific mail driver
subdirectory name. For example, the driver subdirectory for Microsoft Mail
is WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSMAIL.
<P>
For the System Selector to complete the procedure properly, Windows should
be invoked from the drive on which it is installed. If the client has
invoked Windows from a batch file that does not execute Windows from the
local drive and directory where Windows is installed, this procedure may
fail. If a batch file is being utilized to invoke Windows, the user should
ensure that the batch file makes this drive and directory active when
executing WIN.COM.
<P>
For example, if the following batch file commands are executed to start
Windows, the System Selector may copy files to the WINDOWS directory
instead of WINDOWS\SYSTEM, which would result in the above stated error
condition:
<P>
<P><h3>WRONG.BAT</h3>
 
F:Login
C:\WINDOWS\WIN
<P>
The following batch file would execute the procedure correctly:
<P>
<P><h3>RIGHT.BAT</h3>
 
F:Login
C:
CD WINDOWS
WIN
