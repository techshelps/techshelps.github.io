<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, some mail items
are marked as unread after they are downloaded even though it appears
that the messages should be marked as read.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because Mail does not mark an item as read until
it is successfully downloaded to the remote client. The External Mail
program (EXTERNAL.EXE) does not mark an item as successfully
downloaded until the connection closes.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is part of the design of EXTERNAL.EXE.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The External Mail program builds the header list before it downloads
message items. It would be very difficult to build the header list
after Mail downloads the last header item.
<P>
The message number on the client is different from the message number
on the postoffice. Therefore, Mail cannot compare message numbers to
determine which messages have been read. One possible method would be
to compare the user ID and the message subject. However, this method
is ineffective because more than one message can have the same user ID
and message subject (for example, an exchange of messages about a
subject). Therefore, there is no easy method to track read messages
other than tracking downloaded messages.
