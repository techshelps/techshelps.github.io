The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, and 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
REQTRANS.GLB is the directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) transaction file
that contains the transactions from that postoffice. Each transaction has a
transaction number or sync number associated with it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run REQMAIN -t, a requestor sends out the following:

<UL><LI>A status message with an attachment. The header on the status line reads
<P>
<P><PRE>      Status report from NET/PO
</PRE><P>
   The attachment that goes with this message is the DSSERVER.LOG from the
   requestor postoffice. The information from this log is used to update
   the CENTRAL.LOG on the Dir-Sync server (this is why the information in
   the CENTRAL.LOG is always a day behind).

<LI>If there are updates, another message is sent out with an attachment.
   The attachment contains actual transactions. The header from the message
   reads
<P>
<P><PRE>      REQTX R=x(was y)....z sent
</PRE><P>
   The x is the sync number of the last transaction being sent (picked up
   from REQTRANS.GLB). The y is the last acknowledged number picked up from
   REQCONF.GLB. The z is the number of actual transactions being sent this
   cycle, thus, x=y+z.
<P>
</UL>Having transactions in the REQTRANS.GLB alone does not mean that there
are updates to be sent.
<P>
If there are transactions in the REQTRANS.GLB with transaction numbers
higher than the last confirmed REQSYNC number (recorded in REQCONF.GLB), it
means that there are updates to be sent.
<P>
If there are transactions in the REQTRANS.GLB with transaction numbers
lower than the last confirmed REQSYNC number (recorded in REQCONF.GLB),
they are not deemed to be new updates because, according to the
REQCONF.GLB, these transactions were sent and even acknowledged by the Dir-
Sync server. Typically, this is when you would get a "No Updates to Send"
message even when there are updates.
<P>
Initially, there is a zero byte REQTRANS.GLB. As users are added to Dir-
Sync, the transactions are added to REQTRANS.GLB starting with transaction
numbers 1, 2 and so on. If the updates are sent to the server and
acknowledged by the server, the requestor processes the acknowledgment
during T3, when REQMAIN -r is run. The REQCONF.GLB is updated, and all
transactions in the REQTRANS.GLB with sequence numbers below the number in
the acknowledgment are discarded. A 49 byte REQTRANS.GLB file is left, and
all it contains is the last confirmed REQSYNC number.
