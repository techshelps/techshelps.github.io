The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1x, 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks have a
very complex group structure. The global group definitions span many files.
These files include:
<P>
<PRE>   GROUP.GLB    (Contains the postoffice group names)
   GRPMEM.GLB   (Used for group folders.)
   ADMIN.GRP    (Contains tuple identifier (TID) values for group members)
   ADMINSHD.GRP (Shadow file of ADMIN.GRP)
   xxxxxxxx.MEM (Contains group member mailbags for external mail delivery)
   ADMIN.NME    (Postoffice address list)
   ADMINSHD.NME (Shadow file of ADMIN.NME)

</PRE>In addition, ACCESS2.GLB is used to find all local postoffice group
member's mailbag numbers, and NETPO.GLB is used when there are any external
addresses included in the global group. All external users or groups that
are going to be included in a local global group must be added to the
postoffice address list (ADMIN.NME) prior to being included in a local
global group.
<P>
The files that are accessed when mailing to a global group from the
postoffice address list are:
<P>
<PRE>   ADMIN.NME
   ADMIN.GRP
   GROUP.GLB and
   ACCESS2.GLB.

</PRE>The NETPO.GLB will also be accessed if the group contains external
addresses.
<P>
The GROUP.GLB appears to be an unnecessary component of the mailing process
but if the GROUP.GLB file is missing or if the GROUP.GLB has been reset to
a 4 byte header, then the user will receive a Notice 8," Error in
transmitting mail or server disk is full." However, if the group's
definition in the GROUP.GLB has a corrupted alias, address, TID (MEM
filename), type, or delete flag, the group can still be mailed to from the
postoffice address list.
<P>
The ADMIN.NME has a 45 byte record that contains the group's alias, TID
(which for the group is the *.MEM filename), alias type (4 = group), and a
pointer that is a byte offset into the ADMIN.GRP file where the group's
definition begins. Each of the local user's addresses are also stored in
the ADMIN.NME.
<P>
The ADMIN.GRP is a linked list of TID values representing all of the group
member's TID values in the ADMIN.NME. The byte offset stored in the group's
ADMIN.NME record points to the first member's record in the ADMIN.GRP which
contains that user's TID value in the ADMIN.NME and the byte offset from
the beginning of the ADMIN.GRP to the next member of the group. This linked
list continues until a null offset (0) is encountered, which is the end of
the group definition. The ADMIN.GRP contains all of the linked lists for
all local global group members on the postoffice.
<P>
Each group member's TID value in the ADMIN.GRP corresponds to that member's
TID value in the ADMIN.NME. Each of the local group member's mailbag
numbers are then derived from the user s ADMIN.NME record that points to
the user s record in the ACCESS2.GLB. The ACCESS2.GLB record contains the
filename of that user's mailbag.
<P>
The external groups or users that may have been added to the postoffice
address list in order to be included in the local group will have an alias
type of 2. All group members that have this alias type in the ADMIN.NME
will have their addresses resolved through the NETPO.GLB file. The external
member's byte offset in the NETPO.GLB file will be determined from the
"file pointer" field in the ADMIN.NME. The external member's record in the
NETPO.GLB will then yield that member's network name, postoffice name,
mailbox name, and the mailbag number for the external postoffice definition
on the local postoffice. That member's mail message will then be passed to
the external postoffice's mailbag where it will wait for the external MTA
to send the message.

The following diagram may be helpful in conceptualizing the way groups are
resolved.

         Offset           TID               /----&gt;ACCESS2.GLB ---&gt;mailbag
                                          /
</PRE>ADMIN.NME------&gt;ADMIN.GRP-----&gt;ADMIN.NME/
<PRE>                                        \
                                          \  Byte Offset
                                            \----&gt;NETPO.GLB -----&gt;mailbag
                                              (external users only)

</PRE>NOTE: The GROUP.GLB file must be present for the group mail to be
resolved, but it does not participate in determining the destination
mailbags.
