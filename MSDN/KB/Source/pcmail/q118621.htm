<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article answers some commonly asked questions regarding directory
synchronization (Dir-Sync).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>When I create a user and exclude the user from Dir-Sync , the user's
    name still appears on the Global Address List (GAL) on that postoffice.
    Why?
<P>
    This is expected behavior. When a user is excluded from Dir-Sync, the
    user's address will not be propagated to other postoffices. However,
    the user will be visible to users on the postoffice that the user
    belongs to and will show up in the GAL on that postoffice.

<P><LI>Can I have more than one Dir-Sync server?
<P>
    No. Requestors can be registered with only one Dir-Sync server. Also,
    the Dir-Sync server cannot be registered as a requestor with another
    Dir-Sync server.

<P><LI>When I change the template file ADMIN.TPL, the updated template is not
    distributed to other postoffices. Why?
<P>
    When you change the template file ADMIN.TPL that contains the
    template definition, you must select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor,
    Export command to distribute the updated template file to all
    postoffices.

<P><LI>Is a Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Export required when the template
    information stored in ADMIN.INF is modified through the Admin program
    or the Import process?
<P>
    No. Changes to ADMIN.INF are automatically distributed. For more
    information, please refer to page 160 of the version 3.2
    "Administrator's Guide."

<P><LI>Gateway addresses processed through Import are not being distributed to
    other postoffices. Why?
<P>
    For gateway addresses to propagate to all the postoffices participating
    in Dir-Sync, you should use Import with the -e option. Changes made
    through Admin or Import (without -e option) will not be distributed
    to other postoffices.

<P><LI>What if I have already imported the gateway addresses using Import
    without the -e option?
<P>
    You can use Import with the -x option to extract the addresses, and
    then use Import with -e option to get them into the Dir-Sync
    stream (REQTRANS.GLB).

<P><LI>Can extended information (templates) be imported for all gateway types?
<P>
    No. Extended information can be added only to gateways that conform
    to the 10/10/10 addressing.

<P><LI>Dir-Sync appears to run without a hitch. However the number of entries
    in the GAL of each postoffice is different. Why?
<P>
    Variation in the number of entries in the GAL on each postoffice by
    itself is no cause for concern. Some possibilities are:
<P>
    a. Users excluded from Dir-Sync will be included in the GAL of the
       home postoffice but will not show up on the GAL of other
       postoffices.
<P>
    b. Not all postoffices may be requesting all types of addresses (for
       example, gateway addresses). This choice is available under Config,
       Dir-Sync, Requestor, Options, Types.
<P>
    c. Groups containing external users will not be propagated to other
       postoffices.

<P><LI>In the Windows client, when the GAL is the default address list, the
    Check names function returns an error although the address exists in
    the Global Address List. Why?
<P>
    A GAL rebuild problem manifests itself in the form of a Check names
    problem in the Windows client. There were some problems with Rebuild
    version 3.0.x that were fixed with Rebuild version 3.2.x.

<P><LI>Is there an easy way to monitor the success of the Dir-Sync process
    other than checking the logs on each postoffice and checking the
    sync numbers?
<P>
    Yes, on each postoffice, the administrator can add a user with a full
    name that reflects the current date, the network, and postoffice
    name (for example, Jul21 Network Postoffice). The administrator needs
    to modify the full name each day to reflect the current date.
<P>
    When this procedure is used, each administrator can log into the
    Windows client and do a Check Names on the current date, Jul21.
    This will bring up an entry for each postoffice that participated in
    Dir-Sync. The logs can be checked for those postoffices that did not
    participate in Dir-Sync.
<P>
    NOTE: This method introduces administrative overhead, (although Import
    can facilitate the process) and relies on the Administrator making the
    modification at each postoffice.

<P><LI>Which is the best place to begin troubleshooting Dir-Sync problems?
<P>
    The DISPATCH.LOG gives an indication of the return code for the Dir-
    Sync processes namely "NSDA -RT," "NSDA -S," and "NSDA -RR". The
    DIRSYNC.LOG on each postoffice provides more detailed information.

<P><LI>When EXTERNAL is run as an idle process of Dispatch, is it necessary
    to specify break parameters for External?
<P>
    No. Dispatch appends a break relative time to the idle process command
    line automatically.

<P><LI>With version 3.2 of Dispatch, I am unable to run Dispatch, External,
    and Schdist from the same machine. Why?
<P>
    With version 3.3 and 6.x of MS-DOS, this will work provided that
    COMMAND.COM is copied to the same directory where the dispatch
    executables reside. For additional information, please see the
    following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>        ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q101752.htm">Q101752</A></B>
        TITLE     : PC Ext: Dispatch Cannot Spawn Batch File Without
                    COMMAND.COM

</PRE><P><LI>Can I run more than one Dispatch process per postoffice?
<P>
    No, only one Dispatch process should be run against a postoffice.

<P><LI>The Dir-Sync times change around Daylight Savings Time (DST). How can
    this be changed?
<P>
    When a Dir-Sync process runs, it is rescheduled to run a week later
    at the same time. If the rescheduled time falls after a DST change,
    the process time is changed. The administrator has to manually change
    the process times on each postoffice after the DST change has been
    effected.

<P><LI>What is the proper usage for the TZ variable?
<P>
    Please refer to the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>        ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../PCMAIL/Q101753.htm">Q101753</A></B>
        TITLE     : PC DirSync: When to Use the Time Zone Option with
                    Dir-Sync

</PRE><P><LI>Is there any way to restrict gateway addresses from showing up in
    the Global Address List?
<P>
    No. Rebuild will process all the addresses available in the mail
    database (postoffice) into the Global Address List.

<P><LI>Does Dispatch or one of the Dir-Sync agents that Dispatch spawns
    transfer the Dir-Sync mail between postoffices?
<P>
    No. Dispatch creates Dir-Sync mail messages, but External is the
    agent that transfers the message between postoffices.

<P><LI>Can a foreign mail system participate in Dir-Sync?
<P>
    Yes, to participate in Dir-Sync, the foreign mail system should create
    a foreign requestor. The Dir-Sync process considers the foreign
    requestor as a requestor postoffice. For more information, please
    obtain the "Directory Synchronization with Foreign Mail Systems"
    guide (part number 34524) from the Microsoft Sales and Information
    Center at (800) 426-9400.

<P><LI>Are the Dir-Sync executables bound applications?
<P>
    NOTE: Bound applications are designed and built so that they can
    be run under either OS/2 or MS-DOS.
<P>
    All Dir-Sync files, except DISPATCH.EXE, are bound executables. The
    bound executables run on both OS/2 and MS-DOS.

<P><LI>Where can I find more information about Dir-Sync?
<P>
    You can refer to the Microsoft Mail "Administrator's Guide." There is
    also a Dir-Sync Application Note WA0725, "Directory Synchronization
    (Dir-Sync)" that covers the Dir-Sync process in depth.
