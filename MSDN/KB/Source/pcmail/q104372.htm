The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
With version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation,
when you try to delete a folder (private or shared) by selecting Options,
Folders, Delete, the following error message may be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Notice 132 Folder busy. Try again later.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs if the folder is missing, is locked open, or has read-
only attributes.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Determine the 8-digit ID (hexid) for the folder. If it is a public folder,
use the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   dumpidx -n foldroot.idx

</PRE>If the folder is a private folder, use the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   DUMPIDX -n HEXID.IDX

</PRE>If the &lt;xxxxxxxx&gt;.FLD file is missing, you can restore the file from a
backup copy. If a backup is not available, create a new folder and copy the
new &lt;xxxxxxxx&gt;.FLD file to the &lt;xxxxxxxx&gt;.FLD file that is missing.
<P>
For example, if the missing folder file is 00000010.FLD and the new folder
created is 00000011.FLD, copy 00000011.FLD to 00000010.FLD. The file size
for the new folder should be 129 bytes. You now can delete the folder.
<P>
If the &lt;xxxxxxxx&gt;.FLD file exists, check the attributes and remove the read-
only attribute if it has been set.
<P>
If the folder file is locked open, use the FOLDCOMP -S command when folders
are not being accessed. This will release the semaphore lock on the file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can determine the user's 8-digit ID by using the LISTUSER utility. The
LISTUSER and DUMPIDX utilities are available in the Application Note titled
"Database Maintenance Utilities," WA0641, which describes operational
details for utilities used to repair and maintain the database for
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. The procedures described apply to versions
2.1 and later of Microsoft Mail except where noted.
<P>
You can have this Application Note mailed or faxed to you by contacting
Microsoft Product Support Services.
<P>
The FOLDCOMP utility is located in the MAILEXE subdirectory of the Mail
database. You should run FOLDCOMP and DUMPIDX from the FOLDERS\PUB
subdirectory if the folder is a shared folder, or from the user's
FOLDERS\LOC\HEXID subdirectory if the folder is a private folder.
