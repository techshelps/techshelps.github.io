The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides a SETUP.INF file to be used when you update the
Microsoft Mail for Windows client to version 3.2a on workstations running
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11.
<P>
For complete information about obtaining and installing the SETUP.INF file,
see the "To update your SETUP.INF file" section below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This update resolves the following problem:

<UL><LI>The Mail files that are installed by Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
   have a higher version number than some of the files provided with
   version 3.2a of Mail for Windows. The SETUP.INF file included with Mail
   for Windows does not enable the SETUP.EXE program to replace all of the
   Windows for Workgroups Mail files with the Mail for Windows files.
<P>
</UL><h3>Before You Update Windows for Workgroups Clients: Important Information</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If users' Mail message files (MMFs) were created with the Windows for
   Workgroups Mail client and the DoubleSpace option for Optimizing Local
   Mail Files was activated in the Mail Options dialog box, each user must
   change this setting to Highest Security before upgrading to the version
   3.2a Mail for Windows client. The Mail for Windows client does not
   support DoubleSpace compressed MMFs.

<P><LI>The Windows for Workgroups Password Caching feature is not supported in
   the Mail for Windows client. Each user must know his or her Mail
   password before upgrading his or her Mail for Windows client. If a user
   does not know or remember his or her password, use the Mail
   Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) provided with version 3.2a of
   Microsoft Mail for PC Networks to reset the password for that user.

<P><LI>Before you perform the upgrade, run Windows Setup, and choose Options,
   Add/Remove Windows Components, Accessories, to remove the Mail and Mail
   Help files from each workstation. This will ensure a cleaner upgrade.
<P>
</OL>IMPORTANT NOTE: Mail 3.2 does not support At Work Fax functionality. This
option will no longer be available to clients once they upgrade to version
3.2a.

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online
               Services

</PRE>After you download WSETUP.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing
"wsetup" at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of the file.
You should receive the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   SETUP.INF  (6,940  bytes, dated 10-18-94, 7:43 P.M.)
   README.TXT

</PRE><h3>To update your SETUP.INF file</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Before you install this SETUP.INF file, you should run the SETUP.EXE
program provided with version 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks to
install or update the postoffice data files, server programs, and client
programs. If you are currently using a Windows for Workgroups postoffice,
you should use version 3.2a of the Postoffice Upgrade for Microsoft Windows
for Workgroups to upgrade the Windows for Workgroups postoffice data files,
server programs, and client programs before you install this SETUP.INF
file.

<OL><P><LI>Connect to the shared directory on the server where the client program
   files were installed by the version 3.2a Mail for PC Networks SETUP.EXE
   program.

<P><LI>Rename the existing SETUP.INF file in this shared directory to
   SETUPINF.OLD.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;path&gt;:\setup.inf &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
   extracting WSETUP.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and
   directory where the client program files were installed by the Mail for
   PC Networks SETUP.EXE program. For example, if you ran the self-
   extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and the SETUPINF.OLD
   file is located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following
   command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy d:\test\setup.inf c:\mailexe
</PRE>
<P><LI>Have each user connect to the network drive and directory containing the
   client program files and run SETUP.EXE. This will update the user s
   workstation to version 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for Windows.
