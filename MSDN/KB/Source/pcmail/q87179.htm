<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A complete listing of command-line options for the gateway program
(HostDisp or VMGATE) can be obtained by typing the program name
followed by a question mark (for example, HOSTDISP ?).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Here are some of the options that are most useful when troubleshooting
problems with the gateway (listed alphabetically):
<P>
<PRE>   Option   Description
   ------   -----------

   -Inn     "Items." The maximum number of LAN mail items to queue when
            checking for mail. Up to two decimal digits can be entered;
            for example, -i0 to -i99 can be specified.

            Note that HostDisp assumes that the mainframe will process
            all uploaded LAN items within 30 minutes (see the -W option,
            below). If MS-GATE's response time is very slow (for
            example, its priority level has been set to a low value),
            either reduce the -I parameter and/or increase the -W
            parameter. Default is 50 items. An -i0 value indicates that
            you want to receive VM mail only; LAN mail will not be
            uploaded to the mainframe.

   -Knn     "Klicks." Number of seconds to wait after control is
            returned to HostDisp from the spawned SEND and RECEIVE
            programs. Allows time to re-establish internal handshaking
            between the host session and the PC. Default is 3 seconds.
            Valid range: 0 to 99.

   -L       "Log." Copy screen messages to the LOG\VMGATE.LOG file in
            the MS Mail data files. If VMGATE.LOG already exists, new
            messages will be appended.

   -MS      "Messages Sent." Log SENT message synopsis to the
            LOG\SENT.LOG file in the MS Mail data files.

   -MR      "Messages Received." Log RECEIVED message synopsis to the
            LOG\RECV.LOG file in the MS Mail data files.

   -Nnnn    "Next." Time interval between checking for mail. Up to three
            digits can be entered. The valid range is 0 to 999 minutes;
            for example, -n0 to -n999 can be specified.

            Default is 5 minutes; -n0 value indicates continuous
            checking.

   -Tnnnnn  "Terminate." Check for VM host mail nnnnn times, then
            terminate HostDisp. Range: 0 - 2 to the 31st minus one (a
            ten-digit number). HostDisp will still terminate when the
            ESC key is pressed by the operator. Omitting this option
            means terminate only with operator intervention (pressing
            the ESC key), or because the -W, -BT, -BD, or -BR option
            limits have been reached. This option is useful if your site
            uses an automatic logon/logoff program to initiate/terminate
            HostDisp.

   -V       "Verbose." Provides many informative messages. This option
            is useful when learning the behavior of this program. If you
            have also specified the "-L" option, the messages will also
            be copied to the LOG\VMGATE.LOG text file. Whenever an error
            is detected, an appropriate message will be displayed
            whether this option has been specified or not. This option
            automatically invokes the "-aB" option.

   -Wnn     "Wait." HostDisp waits for a maximum of 99 minutes. After
            LAN mail has been uploaded, HostDisp waits until MS-GATE
            signals that it has distributed all LAN mail. Use this
            option if it takes longer than 30 minutes to process a
            Directory Services IMPORT request, or if MS-GATE's priority
            level is low. This option forces an earlier/later exit.
            Default is 30 minutes; range is 1 to 99.

            Notes:

             - If HostDisp terminates, the LAN mail that had just been
               uploaded will not be deleted from the database and will
               be moved to the VMGATE\ERR subdirectory.

             - If the "-E" option was specified, a diagnostic mail
               message will be sent to that address.
