The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
This article outlines the procedure to move a version 3.0 Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks user from one postoffice to another. Follow the steps
below, based on the type of user you are moving.
<P>
<P><h3>User Runs MS-DOS and/or Macintosh Client Only</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Move all mail in the user's inbox that the user wants to retain into
   folders.

<P><LI>Archive the folders using the MS-DOS client. This can be done by
   choosing Options, Folders, Folders, Archive.

<P><LI>If the user owns any shared or group folders, archive the folder, then
   delete it. The user can then pass the archived folders over to another
   user on the postoffice to own them.

<P><LI>Delete the user from the postoffice.

<P><LI>Add the user to the new postoffice.

<P><LI>De-archive the folders using the MS-DOS client.

<P><LI>Promptly re-export both address lists.
<P>
</OL><h3>User Runs Windows and/or PM Client Only</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Move the Mail message file (MMF) to local storage. This can be done by
   choosing Options from the Mail menu and selecting the Server button.

<P><LI>Make a backup of the MMF. This can be done by choosing Backup from the
   Mail menu.

<P><LI>If the user owns any shared folders, they should be archived using the
   MS-DOS client, and then deleted. The user then can pass the archived
   folders over to another user on the postoffice to own them.

<P><LI>Delete the user on the postoffice.

<P><LI>Create the user on the new postoffice, using the same alias.

<P><LI>Have the user run Mail on the new postoffice and move the MMF to local
   storage. This can be done by choosing Options from the Mail menu and
   selecting the Server button.

<P><LI>Copy the backup MMF to the name and location of the new locally stored
   MMF.

<P><LI>Promptly re-export both address lists.
<P>
</OL>For Microsoft Schedule+ users, because a copy of the user's calendar
file is kept on both the server and the user's local workstation,
nothing need be done. The next time the user logs on to Schedule+, a
copy of the local calendar file will be uploaded to the server.
<P>
<P><h3>User Runs a Combination of Both MS-DOS/Macintosh and Windows/PM Clients</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Using the MS-DOS client, move all mail in the inbox that you want to
    save into folders.

<P><LI>Archive the folders using the MS-DOS client. This can be done by
    choosing Options, Folders, Folders, Archive.

<P><LI>If the user owns any shared or group folders, the user should archive
    the folder and then delete it. The user then can pass the archived
    folders to another user on the postoffice to own them.

<P><LI>Using the Windows or PM client, move the Mail message file (MMF) to
    local storage. This can be done by choosing Options from the Mail menu

    Mail menu.

<P><LI>Delete the user on the postoffice.

    MMF.
