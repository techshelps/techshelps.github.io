</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
An asynchronous instance of External may occasionally fail to answer an
incoming call. When this happens, the phone rings several times, the modem
does not go off-hook, and the line is not picked up. The caller will see a
No Answer response to the dial attempt. If the caller attempts a second
call, the call will often go through without any problem.
<P>
For the best results, set up separate instances for your asynchronous
connections and for these instances, include the MailerDisable and
DispatchDisable options in the EXTERNAL.INI file.
<P>
NOTE: There must be another instance of External that can perform the
Mailer and Dispatch functions before the options mentioned above can be
used. Other steps can be taken to minimize the chance of unanswered calls.
See the section below for additional information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
External is coded to poll for incoming calls. Thus, External will
periodically check the communications channel for activity. Ordinarily,
External will reach one of these polling points during the rings of an
incoming call, and it will pick up the call.
<P>
When factors exist that effect the performance of External, that is, slow
its cycle, there will be an increased chance of not reaching the polling
point while the call is occurring.
<P>
Here are some factors that can slow External and cause missed incoming
calls:
<P>
<PRE>   Slow Network Links
   Congested Network Links
   Slow Server Response
   Slow PC used for External
   Defective Hardware

</PRE>These factors should be investigated and conditions improved, if possible.
<P>
If a wide area network is involved, it might be possible to use the
DrivesWAN option of External. This is similar to using the DispatchDisable
and MailerDisable options, but does not require a second External at the
local site. DrivesWAN does require that there be other External programs
running at other sites.
<P>
Also, External will not answer incoming calls while it is updating
information from one of the postoffices. Checks for updates occur at
regular intervals determined by the IntervalUpdate parameter. An update
does not occur at every check, but if changes have been made through the
Administrator's program (ADMIN.EXE) or Import program (IMPORT.EXE), then
the update takes place. The update interval can be increased so that checks
occur less frequently and at more controlled times of the day.
