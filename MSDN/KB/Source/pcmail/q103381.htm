The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, running with
   Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0 or 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Non-English versions of Microsoft Mail for Windows must be updated with new
libraries to correctly support the development and use of electronic forms
(E-forms). Disk 2 of the version 1.0 Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer
disks contains updated versions of MAILSPL.EXE, MSSFS.DLL, and MAPI.DLL for
the German and French versions of Microsoft Mail. Updated versions of these
files for other languages will be available from your local Microsoft
subsidiary.
<P>
The files on Disk 2 are in compressed format. The French version of the
updated files are in the INTL\FRN directory of Disk 2. The German version
are in the INTL\GER directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To install the updated Forms Designer files for French or German Microsoft
Mail, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the Designer Setup program to install the Electronic Forms Designer,
   by following the instructions in the Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer
   "Developer's Guide."

<P><LI>Exit Windows.

<P><LI>Insert Disk 2 of the Electronic Forms Designer into your floppy disk
   drive and at the MS-DOS prompt, select your floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>To install the French version of the files, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd a:\intl\frn
</PRE><P>
   To install the German version of the files, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd a:\intl\ger
</PRE>
<P><LI>Change the current drive to the drive that contains your Windows
   directory. If your Windows directory is not in your path, copy the
   EXPAND.EXE program from your Windows directory to your Windows SYSTEM
   directory.

<P><LI>Change the current directory to your Windows system directory. For
   example, if your Windows system directory is on drive C and is called
   WINDOWS\SYSTEM, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd c:\windows\system
</PRE>
<P><LI>Type the following commands to copy and decompress the updated Microsoft
   Mail files into your Windows system directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      expand a:mailspl.ex_ mailspl.exe
      expand a:mssfs.dl_ mssfs.dll
      expand a:mapi.dl_ mapi.dll
</PRE><P>
</OL>To install the updated files for access by E-form users with French or
German Microsoft Mail, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the Electronic Forms Designer Server Setup program to install the
   E-form run-time files into the shared extensions directory by following
   the instructions in the Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer "Developer's
   Guide."

<P><LI>Follow steps 2 through 4 in the procedure listed above, but instead of
   decompressing and copying the updated files into the Windows SYSTEM
   directory, copy and decompress the files into the EFORMS\RUNTIME
   directory created by the Server Setup program.
<P>
</OL>This procedure replaces the English versions of the libraries created by
the User Setup program with the French or German version of the library
files, so that when users run the User Setup program, the correct language
version is installed on their machines.
