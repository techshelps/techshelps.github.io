The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 2.1d, 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2
</UL> 
<P>
When you use version 2.1d, 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for
Windows, group names are expanded on the recipient line, revealing all
the members of the group.
<P>
<P><h3>Situations When Group Names Are NOT Expanded</h3>
 
<P>
With versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when a
message is sent to a group that is present in the Postoffice List, the
Global Address List (GAL), or the Network List, the group names are
not expanded. This includes groups containing local postoffice users,
external postoffice users, and both local and external users.
<P>
With version 2.1d of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when a message is
sent to a group that is present in the Postoffice List, the Personal
Address List, or the Network List, the group names are not expanded.
This includes groups containing local users, external users, and both
local and external users.
<P>
<P><h3>Situations When Group Names ARE Expanded</h3>
 
<P>
With versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when a
message is sent to a group created in the Personal Address Book (PAB),
the group name is expanded to reveal the friendly names of all the
members of the group. This occurs only when the group is created in
the Personal Address Book and does not contain any other groups
defined in the Postoffice Address List (PAL), the Global Address List,
or the Network List. If the group created in the Personal Address Book
contains other groups that are defined in the Postoffice Address List,
the Global Address List, or the Network List, the group name is
expanded to reveal the members of that group, which are other groups;
however, these member groups are not expanded.
<P>
With version 2.1d of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when a message is
sent to a group of people using version 2.1d or later of Mail for
Windows, the version 2.1d users receive the message with the group
name NOT expanded. MS-DOS client users with version 3.0 or later also
receive the message with the group name NOT expanded. Windows client
users with version 3.0 or later receive the message with the group
name expanded. The group name is expanded to reveal the mailbox names
and not the friendly names of the members of the group.
