<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are running Word for Windows in the Windows operating system version
3.1 with the Windows PostScript printer driver version 3.5 or 3.51, you may
experience a rapid, spontaneous loss of Windows resources from the user
heap. This problem occurs in multiple-section documents that are formatted
with both portrait and landscape orientation. When the Windows resources
are depleted, you receive an "Out of Memory" error message.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you create a multiple-section Word for Windows document and your default
printer driver is the PostScript driver version 3.5 or 3.51, Windows 3.1
may begin to lose resources if you format the sections for a mixture of
portrait and landscape orientation. This depletion continues until Windows
has no resources left. This depletion appears to occur faster in normal
view than in page layout view. When Word for Windows asks the printer
driver for information to redraw the screen (this occurs when you move the
insertion point across a section break), the driver uses memory but does
not mark it for deletion. This prematurely fills the stack and depletes the
Windows system resources.
<P>
To check the available system resources, activate the Program Manager, and
choose About Program Manager from the Help menu.
<P>
After the Windows system resources are depleted, you receive "Out of
Memory" messages in Word for Windows in response to any action. Word does
allow you to save your document; if the document has not yet been saved, it
is named RESCUE.DOC. (There are not enough resources to display the Save As
dialog box.) When you exit Word for Windows, the Windows resources are
restored.
<P>
This problem was corrected in version 3.53. To obtain the latest PostScript
driver call Microsoft Customer Support or call the Microsoft Download
Service at (425) 936-6735. For more information about the MSDL, query on
"Instructions for Using the Microsoft Download Service" in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, activate a different printer when you work on
multiple-orientation documents. A good alternative is the Hewlett-Packard
(HP) LaserJet Series II. If you are using TrueType fonts, your formatting
should not be affected by changing to the HP III driver. When you are ready
to print the document, switch back to the PostScript printer driver.
