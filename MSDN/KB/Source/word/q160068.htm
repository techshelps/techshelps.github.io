<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<PRE>                       OPTIMIZING MICROSOFT WORD 97
                       ============================

</PRE>The following issues affect overall Word performance.
<P>
If you are unfamiliar with a term used in this article, see the glossary.
<P>
To use Microsoft Word 97, you need the following:
<P>
Note: See the product literature or the Ofread8.txt and Wdread8.txt files
for a complete list of requirements. Both files are included on your CD in
the Office folder.

<UL><LI>Personal or Multimedia computer with a 486 or higher processor.
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 operating system or Windows NT Workstation
   3.51 with Service Pack 5 or later (will not run on earlier
   versions). To use Microsoft Word 97 with Windows NT Workstation
   4.0, you must install Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later.
<LI>8 megabytes (MB) of RAM for use on Windows; 16 MB of memory for use on
   Windows NT Workstation.
<LI>20-60 MB of hard disk space required; 46 MB required for
   typical installation, depending on configuration (use the
   Office Upgrade Wizard during Setup to maximize free disk
   space).
<LI>8 MB of additional memory required to run WordMail.
<P>
</UL><h2>Increase RAM</h2>
 
<P>
The amount of memory Word 97 needs to run at top speed depends on a variety
of factors, such as how many other applications are running at the same
time and what types of operations Word performs. When other applications
are competing for memory, you can usually improve performance significantly
by running with more than the required amount.
<P>
Word requires 8 MB of memory for use on Windows 95 (8 MB of additional
memory required to run WordMail). However, for best performance on Windows
95, if you plan to run additional applications simultaneously, additional
memory may be required.
<P>
If you regularly work with large documents (50 pages and larger) or use
many graphics or embedded objects in your documents, adding RAM will yield
the most dramatic improvement to Word's operating speed. If your computer
has 16 MB or more of RAM, Word will run faster, and you will also be able
to run another large application (such as Microsoft Excel) at the same time
and interact with it from Word.
<P>
TIP: Make sure that you aren't using any of your RAM for a RAM drive.
<P>
<P><h2>Use Disk Defragmenter to Speed Up Your Hard Disk</h2>
 
<P>
You should occasionally use a utility such as the Windows Disk Defragmenter
to defragment the hard disk. You can use Disk Defragmenter to rearrange
files and unused space on your hard disk so that programs run faster. This
and other third-party disk optimization software helps to minimize the area
on the disk in that Windows 95 needs to look for information. As with any
such utilities, always make back up copies of important files before you
run the program. For more information about using Disk Defragmenter or
other third-party disk optimization software, see your Windows or third-
party documentation.
<P>
<P><h2>Optimize Virtual Memory Use</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: Unless you are an advanced user it is recommended to let Windows 95
manage your Virtual Memory Settings option on the Performance tab of the My
Computer property sheet. You should use the default virtual memory settings
whenever possible.
<P>
With virtual memory, an application sees a large, continuous block of
primary memory (RAM) that, in reality, is a much smaller block of primary
memory supplemented by secondary memory (such as a hard disk). To
temporarily free up space in RAM, blocks of data (called pages) are moved
between RAM and a swap file located on the hard disk.
<P>
By default, the Windows 95 swap file is dynamic, so it can shrink or grow
based on available disk space and the operations performed on the system.
Also, the swap file can occupy a fragmented region of the hard disk with no
substantial performance penalty. A dynamic swap file is usually the most
efficient use of resources. The simplest way to ensure high virtual memory
performance is to make sure that the disk containing the swap file has
ample free space so that the swap file size can shrink and grow as needed.
<P>
In Windows 3.x, enhancing performance by changing virtual memory settings
is quite common. Because the Windows 95 swap file is dynamic, the need to
change virtual memory settings is less common. However, in some situations
adjusting virtual memory settings can improve performance. If you've
already tried deleting unnecessary files, and you still have a performance
problem, try changing the Windows 95 default virtual memory settings.
<P>
If you have more than one drive available, you may get better performance
if you specify that Windows locate the swap file on a drive other than the
default in the following cases:
<P>
- If the default drive doesn't have much free disk space, and another local
<PRE>  drive has space available.

</PRE>- If another local drive is available that is faster than the current drive
<PRE> (unless that disk is already heavily used).

</PRE>You also may get better performance if you specify the minimum disk space
available for virtual memory to be at least 25 MB minus available RAM. For
example, if a computer has 12 MB of RAM, you should specify at least 13 MB
of virtual memory. You may want to specify more if several large
applications will be run at the same time.
<P>
For information on changing Windows 95 virtual memory settings, see the
"virtual memory settings" topic in Windows 95 Help.
<P>
<P><h2>Set Your Computer to Use Fewer Fonts, or to Use a Font Organizing Utility</h2>
 
<P>
The more fonts installed in Windows, the slower Windows and many
applications start because these programs read the entire font list at
startup. Word does not process the font list at startup; however, the
impact of a large number of fonts may be felt at other times such as the
first time you print. In addition, certain dialog boxes (such as the font
dialog or the Insert Symbol dialog) will take longer to appear the first
time in a session with a large number of fonts installed in a system.
Furthermore, when Word needs to perform some complex actions, fonts use
additional memory and file resources.
<P>
<P><h2>Consider Setting Your Monitors to Use Only 16 or 256 Colors</h2>
 
<P>
Set your computer's monitor to use the correct video driver for faster
screen display. You may not need the highest resolution video driver and
the up to 16 million colors your video driver supports. Additional color
support in a video driver can dramatically decrease the speed of screen
updates when you scroll or update graphics.
<P>
For writing reports and working with spreadsheets, you may need only 16 to
256 colors, so you can switch to a video driver that supports a lower
resolution and fewer colors. You can always switch back if there is no
change in performance or if your work requires additional video
capabilities.
<P>
For additional information about video memory requirements for different
video resolutions in Windows 95, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q132328.htm">Q132328</A></B>
   TITLE     : Description of Video RAM Required for Higher Resolutions

</PRE><h2>Work with Word and Files on Uncompressed Drives</h2>
 
<P>
You can use DriveSpace or other third-party utilities to compress both hard
and floppy disks to create more free space for files. While these utilities
increase the disk space available to you, they can slow performance of
software running from that drive, especially if the compression utility is
not optimized.
<P>
The primary reason for performance degradation while running compression
software such as DoubleSpace is that each time a read or write is made from
or to the hard disk, data must be decompressed or compressed. This
decompression or compression of data places additional demand on the
processor in your computer. Computers with faster processors most likely
will not experience performance degradation after compression software is
installed.
<P>
For additional information, please see your third-party documentation or if
you are using DriveSpace, the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q97741.htm">Q97741</A></B>
   TITLE     : Optimizing DoubleSpace on Your Computer

</PRE><h2>Work with files on a local drive, not from floppy drive</h2>
 
<P>
Running Word from or working with files located on a floppy disk may be
slower than working from a local hard drive. Avoid working on files located
on a floppy disk. Copy them locally instead.
<P>
<P><h2>Turn off Use Printer Metrics to Lay Out Document to improve scrolling speed</h2>
 
<P>
For converted documents, turn off Use Printer Metrics to Lay Out Document
to improve scrolling speed. With this option off, Word scrolls faster
because the program does not need to check printer settings to calculate
formatting and layout.  Note:  This option is on by default in converted
documents to preserve exact Word 95 or 6.X document formatting.  Turning
off this option may cause minor changes in line wrapping or document
pagination.
<P>
To change this option:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Compatibility tab.
</OL>2. Select Microsoft Word 6.0/95 from the Recommended Options for list box.
3. Select or clear the Use printer metrics to lay out document check box.
<P>
<P><h2>Don't Use Wallpaper on a Low-Memory Computer</h2>
 
<P>
If the Windows desktop has a wallpaper (full-screen background) bitmap and
the computer has only 8-12 MB installed memory, replace the wallpaper with
a solid color or pattern bitmap, or no bitmap at all.
<P>
<P><h2>Use background save and background print</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Background Save</h3>
 
<P>
To continue working in Word while you save a document, turn on the
background save option. Keep in mind that background save uses additional
system memory; if you need to conserve system resources, you may want to
turn off background save. To change the background save option:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Save tab.
</OL>2. Select or clear the Allow background saves check box.
<P>
NOTES:
<P>
- When Word saves a document in the background, a pulsing disk icon
<PRE>  appears on the status bar.
</PRE></OL>- If Word can't save a document in the background (for example, if
<PRE>  you don't have enough hard disk space or if you're saving a document
  to a floppy disk) Word saves the document in the foreground instead.

</PRE><h3>Background Printing</h3>
 
<P>
Select the Background Printing option that best fits the way you work. With
Background Printing turned on, your document prints a bit more slowly, but
you can continue working in Word while your document prints. With
Background Printing turned off, your document prints quickly, but you
cannot work in Word until the print job is finished. To change the
Background Printing option, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Print tab.
</OL>2. Select or clear Background printing check box.
<P>
Disable Background Spell and Grammar Check
 
<P>
Background spell and grammar checking allows Word to show you misspellings
(red wavy underlines) and grammatical errors (green wavy underlines) while
you are typing. On some systems, this can cause your system to respond
slower than normal. To disable background spell and grammar checking, do
the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Spelling &amp; Grammar
   tab.

<P><LI>Clear the "Check spelling as you type" and "Check grammar as you type"
   check boxes.
<P>
</OL><h2>Saving to Word 95 or 6.X</h2>
 
<P>
You may find the need to save your Word 97 documents to Word 95 or 6.X
format so you can share documents with users of those versions of Word. In
Word 97, you have the option to save the document using the Microsoft Word
6.0-95 converter. However, if you want to increase speed when dealing with
Word 95 or 6.X documents, you may want to install the Microsoft Word 97
converter on the computer using Word 6.0 and 95. This way the conversion is
done in the Word 95 or 6.X and may prove to be the faster conversion
method.
<P>
To use the Word 97 converter after you install it, start Word 95 or Word
6.x, and then open a Word 97 document. For more information about the Word
97 converter, see the Wrd97cnv.doc file installed during the Word 97
converter Setup.
<P>
For additional information, including how to obtain and set up the
converter, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

     TITLE:     : How to Import Word 97 Documents into Word 2.x, 6.x, 7.x

</PRE></OL><h2>Change your View and View Settings</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>View</h3>
 
<P>
In Word, work in normal view instead of page layout view whenever possible.
In page layout view, Word takes longer to redraw the screen and repaginate
the document. To change to normal view, click Normal on the View menu.
<P>
<P><h3>View Settings</h3>
 
<P>
Use Picture Placeholders if your document contains extensive graphics. This
option displays a blank box in place of each graphic in your document. To
change the Picture Placeholders option:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the View tab.

<P><LI>Select or clear Picture Placeholders check box.
<P>
</OL>Use the Draft Font option to speed up screen display in documents with
extensive formatting and graphics. This option displays most character
formatting as underlined and bold, graphics as empty boxes; this option is
only available in normal view.
<P>
To change the Draft Font option use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Switch to normal view (on the View menu, click Normal)

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the View tab.

<P><LI>Select the Draft font check box.
<P>
</OL><h2>Adjust Your System to Speed Up Printing</h2>
 
<P>
If you print large documents that take several minutes to print, disable
any screen savers during the print job, or switch to a blank screen saver.
<P>
Animated screen savers use computer processor time that you can allocate to
a print job. For more information, see your screen saver Control Panel
program or documentation.
<P>
Print using the Draft output option. This option prints the document with
minimal formatting, which makes the document print faster (this option is
ideal for printing proofs).
<P>
NOTE: Some printers do not support this option.
<P>
To change the Draft output option, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Print tab.

<P><LI>Click the Draft output check box select or clear it.
<P>
</OL>If you don't need to continue working while Word is printing, turn off the
Background Printing option in Word.
<P>
This option allocates processor time to Word during a print job so you can
continue working while Word is printing, but this means less processor time
is available for printing. Select the Background Printing option that best
fits the way you work. With Background Printing turned on, your document
prints a bit more slowly, but you can continue working in Word while your
document is printing. With Background Printing turned off, your document is
printed quickly, but you cannot work in Word until the print job is
finished. To turn off the Background Printing option, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Print tab.

<P><LI>Clear the Background printing check box.
<P>
</OL><h2>Disable Outlook Journaling</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook journaling will track documents as they are closed or saved. On
some computers, this may create a noticeable delay during the close or save
process. Outlook journaling is enabled by default when Outlook is
installed. To disable Outlook journaling, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Outlook.

<P><LI>In Outlook, on the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the Journaling tab.

<P><LI>Clear all of the checkboxes in the dialog.
<P>
</OL><h2>Disable the Mouse Scheme</h2>
 
<P>
Disabling the animated mouse scheme will increase the system performance,
although the increase would probably not be noticeable. To disable the
mouse scheme, follow these steps.

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows taskbar, click Start, point to Settings and click Control
   Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Mouse.

<P><LI>Click the Pointers tab.

<P><LI>Set the Scheme to None.
<P>

<PRE>                                 GLOSSARY
                                 ========

</PRE></OL><h3>bitmap</h3>
 
<P>
A graphic made up of a collection of colored dots. The computer stores
the graphic as one or more bits of information for each dot--hence the
name bitmap. Some file name extensions for graphic files that are bitmaps
include .pcx, .tif, .bmp, and .gif.
<P>
<P><h3>compressed drive</h3>
 
<P>
A drive that has had its data compressed to take up less space. Special
software must be running in the system to read from and write to a drive
that is set up this way.
<P>
<P><h3>conventional memory</h3>
 
<P>
The base RAM on your computer, typically the first 640K. Conventional
memory is the only kind of RAM that MS-DOS-based applications can use,
unless you use an expanded memory manager (EMM). Compare expanded
memory, extended memory.
<P>
<P><h3>driver (Windows printer or video driver)</h3>
 
<P>
Software that Windows loads at startup. Drivers give Windows specific
instructions about your video card and printer that Windows and Windows-
based applications use to display information on the screen and to
print information on your printer.
<P>
<P><h3>expanded memory</h3>
 
<P>
A type of physical RAM, up to 8 MB, usually used by MS-DOS-based
applications that support its use. Windows does not use expanded memory.
In Windows, if you run an MS-DOS-based application (such as Microsoft
Word 6.0 for MS-DOS) that requires expanded memory, Windows emulates
expanded memory (if you are running in standard mode, Windows uses the
EMM386.EXE device driver to emulate expanded memory). The use of expanded
memory is defined by the Expanded Memory Specification (EMS). Compare
conventional memory, extended memory.
<P>
<P><h3>extended memory</h3>
 
<P>
Physical RAM beyond 1 MB, accessible when your computer is operating
in protected mode (the mode that supports multitasking). Extended memory
operates through a memory manager such as MS-DOS Himem.sys. Windows uses
extended memory. Extended memory is not typically available to MS-DOS-
based applications except through a device driver such as Emm386.exe.
The use of extended memory is defined by the Extended Memory Specification
(XMS). Compare expanded memory, conventional memory.
<P>
<P><h3>Pagination</h3>
 
<P>
The arrangement of a document's layout, specifically where page breaks fall
within a given document.
<P>
<P><h3>RAM</h3>
 
<P>
Acronym for random access memory. This is the memory on semiconductor
chips in your computer, not on the hard disk. The more RAM you have, the
more programs you can run at the same time and the faster your programs
may run.
<P>
<P><h3>swap file</h3>
 
<P>
A file Windows creates on your hard disk that it uses to swap information
into and out of memory. Windows uses the swap file to create virtual
memory.
<P>
<P><h3>virtual memory</h3>
 
<P>
Also called disk memory. Virtual memory is not in the RAM chips. It is
space on the hard disk that your computer uses as if it were RAM. With
virtual memory, your applications can process files that would otherwise be
too large to fit in physical RAM. Windows uses swap files to create virtual
memory.
