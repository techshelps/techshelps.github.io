<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The printing software for Macintosh that ships with the HP LaserJet 4000
family printer does not install a printer driver icon to the Chooser. This
article identifies which icon should be highlighted to work with the
printer description file (PPD) that was installed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
HP suggests that you use the system printing software already included on
your Macintosh computer. Apple LaserWriter driver versions 8.3.4 and 8.4.1
are the recommended versions to work with the PPD provided by Hewlett-
Packard. Both of these system printer drivers have been tested by Hewlett-
Packard and are known to work with the HP LaserJet 4000 family printers
when printing from a Macintosh computer.
<P>
Before printing successfully from HP 4000 using Word 98, the correct PPD
(printer description file) must be selected using the Chooser.
<P>
<P><h3>Configuring the Printer Driver</h3>
 
<P>
In order to print correctly, you need version 8.3.4 or 8.4.1 or later of
the Apple LaserWriter.
<P>
To configure the printer driver, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Apple menu, click Chooser.

<P><LI>Locate the printer driver for your LaserWriter and select it.

<P><LI>Select the actual printer in the "Select a &lt;Printer Driver Name&gt;
   Printer" list.

<P><LI>Click Setup.

<P><LI>Click Auto Setup.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
   The PPD should be automatically selected for you.
<P>
   NOTE: If you receive a warning message that the correct printer
   description file (PPD) cannot be found, make sure that you have the PPD
   for your printer in the Printer Descriptions folder (either in the
   System folder or in the Extensions folder). If you ran the standard
   setup for the driver, this file should be properly installed.

<P><LI>Click Configure.

<P><LI>Choose the correct settings for your printer, and then click OK twice.
<P>
   NOTE: If you do not know certain items of your printer's configuration,
   the Printer Info button in the Printer Setup dialog may provide the
   information. The dialog box will tell you whether or not certain
   options are installed including the types of networks supported and how
   much memory is installed in the printer.

<P><LI>Close the Chooser.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: HP LaserJet 4000 series printers use PostScript Level 2 emulation.
Hewlett-Packard has not licensed Adobe Postscript from Adobe for use with
this family of printers. HP cannot and does not recommend use of Adobe
printer drivers with the HP LaserJet 4000 printer family.
