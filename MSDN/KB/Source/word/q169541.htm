</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you send a document to a fax recipient from Microsoft Word, the
recipient may receive multiple fax cover sheets with each faxed document.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Cover sheets are being sent both from Word and from the fax.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, specify to send the fax cover sheet from only
one program. Use one of the following methods to turn off the fax cover
sheet option.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: To Turn the Fax Cover Sheet Option Off in Microsoft Word</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Use either of the following methods to activate the Fax Wizard:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - On the File menu, point to Send To, and then click Fax Recipient.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Click New on the File menu, click the Letters &amp; Faxes tab, and
      double-click the Fax Wizard.
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the Fax Wizard, click Next.

<P><LI>When you receive the following prompt
<P>
<P><PRE>      Which document do you want to send?
</PRE><P>
   click to select the "Without a cover sheet" check box.

<P><LI>Click Next to finish the Fax Wizard.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: To Turn Off the Fax Cover Sheet Option from the Fax Software</h3>
 
<P>
See the fax software documentation to find out how to disable the fax cover
sheet. If you are using Microsoft Fax, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control
   Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Mail And Fax icon.

<P><LI>On the Services tab, click Microsoft Fax, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>In the Default Cover Page section, click to clear the Send Cover
   Page check box, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Fax Wizard, if you click to select "With a cover sheet,"
Word will send one fax cover sheet with the document you fax. The fax
cover sheet is a separate document from the Word document you are faxing.
Therefore, in the fax session from Word, you are sending two separate
documents that will be faxed during the fax session. Since the cover sheet
and the document are separate documents, the Fax wizard will transmit them
separately. It will dial, connect and transmit the cover sheet, then
disconnect, redial and connect again, then transmit the document. The Fax
Wizard connects to the receiving fax twice. The only way to prevent this
is to not select "With a cover sheet" from the Fax Wizard.
<P>
When you use Microsoft Fax or another application as your fax service
transport, you have an option to include one fax cover page for each
document you fax.
<P>
Your fax software will send a cover page because you selected the Send
Cover Page option. It will also send a cover page for each of the documents
you are sending from Word--the cover sheet specified in the Fax Wizard and
a cover page for the Word document. You will actually send three fax cover
pages with the Word document.
