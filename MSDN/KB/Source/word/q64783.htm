   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE>Included with this Application Note is a much more extensive
description of PostScript, an explanation of the PostScript interface
in Microsoft Word, and several PostScript examples. Because of the
extensive use of graphics in this Application Note, however, the
full text of MW0316 could not be included here.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
PostScript is a powerful and versatile language used by the Apple
LaserWriter and other PostScript printers to produce graphics and
text. Using Microsoft Word, you can program your own PostScript code
and send it to any PostScript printer.
<P>
<P><h3>The Coordinate System and the Pen</h3>
 
<P>
As far as PostScript is concerned, a piece of paper is a coordinate
system measured in points (a point is 1/72 of an inch). The origin, or
point (0,0), is in the bottom-left corner. On a standard 8.5-inch by
11-inch page, the bottom-right corner is coordinate (612,0), the
top-left corner is coordinate (0,792), and a point 4 inches over and 4
inches up from the point of origin is (288,288).
<P>
PostScript describes graphics by defining the line that an imaginary
pen would follow on this coordinate system.
<P>
<P><h3>The Stack</h3>
 
<P>
The most distinctive element of the PostScript language is that it
uses a concept it refers to as a "stack" to store and manipulate
information. Any number that is typed in PostScript goes to the top of
the stack, and the numbers that preceded it are moved down one position
in the stack. The stack is accessed by commands from the top down, so
that the only way to move farther down in the stack is to remove the
top item in the stack. The concept of the stack is important in
understanding how PostScript code is interpreted and written.
