<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to start a mail merge.
<P>
The process is divided into four parts:

<OL><P><LI>Open or create the main document.

<P><LI>Open or create the data source

<P><LI>Edit the main document.

<P><LI>Perform the merge.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1: Open or Create the Main Document</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you already have a document that you want to use as the main
   document, open it now. The main document can be an existing letter, a
   new letter based on a letter template, or a new blank document.
<P>
   If you do not yet have a document to use as the main document, you can
   create one in step 4.

<P><LI>Open the document in Word. On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge. The Mail
   Merge Helper dialog box appears.

<P><LI>Under "1. Main Document," click Create button and choose Form Letters.

<P><LI>Word asks if you want to use the active window or a new document
   window. If you want to use the document you opened in Step 1, click
   Active Window. (The active document becomes the Mail Merge main
   document.) If you do not have a document yet, click New Main Document.
   (Word creates a new document).
<P>
</OL>Word returns to the Mail Merge Helper.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2: Open or Create the Data Source</h3>
 
<P>
The data source contains the information that can vary in each version
of the form letter. You can open an existing data source created in
Word, or you can create a new data source and fill in the addressee
information.
<P>
NOTE: The data source can also be created in another program such as
Microsoft Excel, Access, a Personal Address Book created in Exchange or
Schedule+, ASCII text files, or other delimited files.
<P>
In the Mail Merge Helper, click Get Data under "2 Data Source." The options 
are Create Data Source (that is, create a new data source), Open Data 
Source (open an existing data source), and Header Options. In Microsoft 
Word for Windows 95, Word 97 for Windows, and Word 98 Macintosh Edition, 
Use Address Book is also available.
<P>
Use any of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1:
<P>
Use this method if you haven't yet typed the names and addresses, and want 
to do so in Word.

<OL><P><LI>Under "2. Data Source," click Get Data and choose Create Data Source.

<P><LI>The Create Data Source dialog box contains a list of
   field names commonly used in form letters, mailing labels,
   and envelopes. You can rename the fields and remove the
   fields you don't need. To add field names, type the name
   in the Field Name box and then choose the Add Field Name
   button. Click OK when you are finished.

<P><LI>When Word prompts you to save the data source, name the
   file and click OK.

<P><LI>When Word asks if you want to edit the data source or set
   up the main document, click Edit Data Source.

<P><LI>When the Data Form dialog box appears, enter your
   addressee information. If there's no information for a
   particular field, leave the box blank.
<P>
   The set of information in each form makes up one data
   record.
<P>
   After entering the information for a record, click Add New 
   to move to the next record. After adding all of your data, click OK.

<P><LI>Skip to "Step 3: Edit the Main Document."
<P>
<P>
</OL>Method 2:
<P>
Use this method if the data source has already been created. 
<P>
To open an existing data source, follow these steps: 

<OL><P><LI>In the Mail Merge Helper dialog box, click Get Data.

<P><LI>Click Open Data Source.

<P><LI>From the list of files, select the data source you want to
   use, and then click OK.
<P>
   If the data source is not listed in the list of files,
   choose the appropriate drive and folder. Select the
   appropriate option in the List Files of Type box.

<P><LI>Word determines whether you need to set up the main
   document and displays a message. Click Edit Main Document.

<P><LI>Skip to "Step 3: Edit the Main Document."
<P>
<P>
</OL>Method 3:
<P>
Use this method if you are using Word for Windows 95, Word 97 for Windows, 
or Word 98 Macintosh Edition, and want to use the names and addresses 
stored in the Address Book.

<OL><P><LI>In the Mail Merge Helper dialog box, click Get Data and select Use 
   Address Book.
<P>
   The Use Address Book dialog box appears with the available
   address books listed under Choose Address Book.

<P><LI>Select the Address Book you want to use as your data
   source. Word may ask you to confirm the data source if you
   have Confirm Conversions selected as an option.
<P>
   If you use an address book/contact list from Schedule+, Word prompts you 
   to log on to Schedule+ and provide a password if necessary.
<P>
   If you use an address book from Exchange, Word asks you to
   log on to the Exchange services.

<P><LI>Word determines whether you need to set up the main
   document and displays a message. Click Set Up Main Document.

<P><LI>Continue with "Step 3: Edit the Main Document."
<P>
</OL><h3>Step 3: Edit the Main Document</h3>
 
<P>
Word returns to the main document. (Notice the appearance of the Mail
Merge Toolbar.)

<OL><P><LI>Type or add any text and graphics you want to include in the letter.

<P><LI>Each time you come to a place where you want to insert information
   from the data source, click the Insert Merge Field button on the Mail
   Merge Toolbar. Choose the appropriate merge field.
<P>
   Make sure you type any spaces or punctuation you want between two
   merge fields or after a merge field.

<P><LI>When you finish editing the main document, click Save or Save As on
   the File menu. Name the file and click Save.
<P>
</OL><h3>Step 4: Perform the Merge</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge. This returns you to the Mail
   Merge Helper.

<P><LI>Under "3. Merge the Data with the Document," click Merge.
   Word displays the Merge dialog box. (Choosing Query Options instead of
   Merge gives you the option to select certain data records to
   participate in the merge or to sort the records in the data source.)

<P><LI>Under Merge To, select New Document to display the merged document
   on the screen. This allows you to view the document before printing
   it. (Select Printer to send the merged document directly to the 
   printer.)

<P><LI>With New Document selected in Merge To, click Merge.

<P><LI>Once the merged document appears on the screen, you can save this as
   a separate document or you can send the merged document to the printer
   by clicking Print on the File menu.
