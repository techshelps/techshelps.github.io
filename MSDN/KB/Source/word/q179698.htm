This article describes how to create a new address book, how to make an
address book active, and how to add or delete names in an address book.

Once you have created an address book and added names to it, you need to
make sure it is the active address book. You can then use that address book
in a mail merge, or by clicking Envelopes and Labels on the Tools menu. To
make a particular address book active, see the "Making an Address Book
Active" section later in this article.
