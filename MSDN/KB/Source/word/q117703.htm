</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Word on a Chameleon NFS, DEC PathWorks, or Sun PC-NFS
network, you get the following behavior:
<P>
Case 1: Saving a Document
<P>
<PRE>        When you save a document, the following error message may
        occur:

           Word cannot save or create this file. Make sure the disk is
           not write protected.

        -or-

        You are able to save to the local drive but receive the
        following message when you attempt to save to a network drive:

           Word cannot save this document. Be sure the drive is not
           full or write-protected.

        NOTE: You may be able to use My Computer or Explorer in Windows
        95 (or File Manager in earlier versions of Windows) to move
        documents to the network drive, but you are unable to access
        the documents directly from within Word for Windows.

</PRE>Case 2: Running a Wizard
<P>
<PRE>        If you run a wizard, the following error message may occur:

           Error 1025: Cannot open the document.

</PRE>Case 3: Opening a Document
<P>
<PRE>        If you try to open a document, the following error message may
        occur:

           Error 1025: Word cannot open the document.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These error messages occur when Word cannot create a docfile (the OLE2
file format). This happens when your connection to a PC-NFS network
drive does not include file locking (also known as mandatory record
locking). File-locking functionality does not exist when:

<UL><LI>You create the connection WITHOUT using the /NS ("no share") switch.
   For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NET USE F: SUNNY:/HOME/WINWORD
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>You create the connection WITH the /MS ("must share") switch. For
   example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NET USE F: SUNNY:/HOME/WINWORD /MS
</PRE><P>
</UL>Both of the examples above create a connection to a PC-NFS network that
does not include file locking. Therefore, Word cannot create docfiles.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Change the /MS switch to /NS, or add the /NS switch if it is missing
from your network connection command line. The following sample command
line creates a connection on a PC-NFS network that supports file
locking:
<P>
<PRE>   NET USE F: SUNNY:/HOME/WINWORD /NS

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Record-Locking Information</h3>
 
<P>
The following information comes from page 75 in the "DEC PathWorks PC-
NFS 5.0 Administration Guide:"
<P>
<PRE>   File sharing provides security at the file level. However, many
   applications require that a common database be updated by multiple
   clients (for example, a transaction-based stock control
   application).

   For this kind of situation, MS-DOS 3.1 or later supports record
   locking mode, also known as byte-range locking. Record locking lets
   you temporarily deny other users access to a particular section of a
   file.

   PC-NFS software supports advisory record locking. It does not
   provide mandatory locking. It is important to be aware of the
   distinction between mandatory and advisory record locking in order
   to adequately protect the integrity of your files in a networked
   environment.

   Mandatory record locking means that if you lock part or all of a
   file, no other application can access the locked portion of the
   file. Mandatory locking prevents access to the locked portion of a
   file, regardless of the consistency of locking requests by other
   users. Advisory record locking ensures that locking requests are
   granted consistently.

</PRE>The DEC PathWorks and Sun products included here are manufactured by
Digital Equipment Corporation and Sun Microsystems, respectively,
vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
