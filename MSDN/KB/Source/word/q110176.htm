The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the purpose, usage, and known support issues for the
SuperDocStatistics macro, supplied with Word 6.0 for Windows in the
MACRO6.DOT file.
<P>
<P><h2>PURPOSE AND FEATURES OF THE MACRO</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Shows information about the following categories: Standard Bookmarks
   (Word's document statistics and grammar statistics), Fields, Fonts,
   Grammar, Graphics, Links, Objects, Sections, and Tables.

<LI>Can generate a report on each of the topics above.

<LI>Allows you to go to document items such as graphics or tables.
<P>
</UL><h2>KNOWN ISSUES</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Word Basic Error #102 occurs if the grammar checker is not installed.
   This problem was corrected in Word version 7.0 for Windows 95.
</OL>2. The macro does not generate a font report.
3. The dialog box takes a long time to appear.
4. Improper case is used in the macro's status bar with graphics.
5. Graphics are bookmarked by the macro.
6. Word counts are not as accurate as Word Count.

<OL><P><LI>Word Basic Error #102 occurs if the grammar checker is not installed.
</OL> 
<P>
If the grammar checker is not installed in 6.x, SuperDocStatistics
generates a WordBasic Error #102 (Command Failed) before the initial dialog
box appears. This should only occur if you chose Custom Setup when
installing Word and you did not install the grammar checker (or you
installed the grammar checker and removed it with Setup).
<P>
This problem was corrected in Word version 7.0 for Windows 95.
<P>
To work around this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Install the grammar checker using Word's Setup program.

<LI>Modify the macro.
<P>
</UL>Note: The following steps assume you have a basic knowledge of working with
macros. For more information, consult the "Word for Windows Macro Developer
Kit."
<P>
To modify the macro, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the macro to your Normal template so it can be edited.

<P><LI>Open the macro in an editing window.

<P><LI>From the top of the code, search for the text "counttools" (without
   the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Insert an apostrophe (') in front of the line to comment it out (that
   is, disable it).

<P><LI>Save the macro.
<P>
</OL>Note: The macro will now start but will still generate a "Command Failed"
error if the Grammar option is chosen. Do not choose the Grammar option.

<OL><P><LI>The macro does not generate a font report.
</OL> 
<P>
When you select the Create Report option when the font statistics are
shown, the macro generates some heading information for fonts as if it will
create a report, but no information about fonts is actually added to the
report.

<OL><P><LI>The dialog box takes a long time to appear.
</OL> 
<P>
On systems with low memory or Windows resources, the dialog box may take
considerable time to appear. The macro code itself is lengthy, and there
are many variables that need to be declared. The macro first displays
"Initializing. Please Wait....." on the status bar when it starts. Longer
documents causes the macro to start slower because the macro repaginates
the document when it is started.

<OL><P><LI>Improper case is used in the macro's status bar with graphics.
</OL> 
<P>
When the macro reports the number of graphics found in the document, the
singular and plural cases are reversed. For example, the macro will report
"Found 1 graphics" or "Found 2 graphic."

<OL><P><LI>Graphics are bookmarked by the macro.
</OL> 
<P>
The macro will automatically bookmark any graphics it finds in the
document. The bookmarks are called Graphic1, Graphic2, and so forth, and
are left in the document after the macro ends.

<OL><P><LI>Word counts are not as accurate as Word Count.
</OL> 
<P>
The word count returned by the macro is not the same as the count returned
by the Word Count feature in Word. Using Word Count from the Tools menu,
returns a more accurate count of words in a document. (The Word Count
results can also be found by choosing Summary Info from the File menu, and
choosing the Statistics button.)
