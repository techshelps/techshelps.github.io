<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word for the Macintosh version 5.0 supports QuickTime
through the Movie Plug-In module (PIM). When properly installed in the
Word Commands folder, the Movie PIM allows for the insertion and
viewing of QuickTime movies in a Word document. The information below
explains the commands available once the Movie Plug-In module has been
installed.
<P>
There are three new commands added to Word's menus:

<OL><P><LI>Insert menu- Movie...
<P>
   This command opens and plays a QuickTime movie in a temporary window,
   then inserts it into the document.

<P><LI>View menu- Play Movie
<P>
   This command opens and plays a QuickTime movie in a temporary window
   but does not insert it.

<P><LI>Edit menu - Edit Movie
<P>
   This command is only available when a movie is selected. It presents
   the Movie Options dialog box.
<P>
</OL>The Movie Options dialog includes the following preferences:
<P>
<PRE>   Always Show Badge
      Displays a small picture of film in the lower left corner of
      the movie when the movie is stopped. The badge indicates the
      PICT is a movie instead of an ordinary graphic.

   Play Continuously
      Plays the movie continuously until stopped.

   Loop Back and Forth
      Plays the movie continuously from the beginning to the end,
      and then from the end to the beginning. If the movie
      includes sound, the sound is also played backward. This
      option has no effect unless Play Continuously is selected.

      Note: This option has no effect unless Play Continuously or
      Double-Click Shows Controller is also selected.

   Double-Click Shows Controller
      Plays the movie with the controller displayed. If you play a
      movie without this option, the mouse pointer shape changes
      to the "pause" symbol (large bold straight double quote)
      while the movie is playing.

   Keep This Display Picture
      Displays current frame of the movie when the movie is not
      playing. The first PICT frame of the movie is displayed
      without this option.

   Always Play from First Frame
      Always resumes play from the beginning after the movie has
      been stopped. However, after a pause the movie continues to
      play from its current frame.
