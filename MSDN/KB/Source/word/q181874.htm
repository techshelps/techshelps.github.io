<UL><LI>Microsoft Direct Mail Manager for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you save results of an address list that was imported into Direct Mail
Manager, your original field names may be changed and all of the Direct
Mail Manager fields may be added to the original address list.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you select "Save Results To A New File." When you
save the results to a new address list, Direct Mail Manager will save all
of the Direct Mail Manager fields as part of the address list.
<P>
NOTE: If you save to the original address list you opened in Direct Mail
Manager, your original field names will be overwritten and additional
fields will be added to your address list.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Type a Different File Name to Save</h3>
 
<P>
After selecting "Save Results To A New File" and clicking on the Next
button, type a new file name for your address list (do not use the original
file name). This way, you will have your original address list and a new
address list with the Direct Mail Manager fields.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Use "Update '&lt;filename&gt;'"</h3>
 
<P>
If you want the changes made to be saved back to the original address list,
when you are prompted "How would you like to save the updated list?," click
to select Update '&lt;Filename&gt;', and then click Next. Only the fields
contained in the original address list will be saved. Direct Mail Manager
will not add fields to your address list.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you select "Save Results To A New File" and then click Next, the
original file name may be suggested to save the changes to the address
list. If you do not change the name of the address list and save to a new
name, the following message will be shown:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;path&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;
   This file already exists.

   Replace existing file?

</PRE>If you click Yes, your original address list may be overwritten and all of
the Direct Mail Manager fields will be added to the address file.
<P>
If you click No, the original address list file name may be presented in
the File name box. If you click Save, the address list file may be
overwritten and all of the Direct Mail Manager fields will be added to the
address list.
<P>
When you save the address information to either a new address list (new
file name) or to your original address list, the following Direct Mail
Manager fields will be saved to your address list:
