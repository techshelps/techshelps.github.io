<P><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
When you use the Thesaurus in Microsoft Word, it may display incorrect
synonyms or no synonyms at all. This problem occurs when you run Word
version 6.0, 6.0a, or 6.0c for Windows (that is, any version of 16-bit
Word), with a non-U.S. version of Windows 95 or a non-U.S. version
Windows NT.
<P>
The problem occurs because non-U.S. versions of Windows 95 and Windows
NT use a different sort order than the U.S. versions. Because the
Thesaurus depends on the operating system's sort order, the Thesaurus
sometimes displays incorrect synonyms.
<P>
This Application Note contains an updated version of the Thesaurus
file (Msthes.dll) that corrects this problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
 
<P>
To install the new file, use the following instructions:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Word for Windows.

<P><LI>If you received a disk with this Application Note, insert the disk
   in the appropriate floppy disk drive.
<P>
   If you downloaded this Application Note from an online service,
   skip to step 3. This procedure assumes that you have already
   downloaded and extracted the compressed file.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;source&gt;:\msthes.dll &lt;location&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;source&gt; is either the letter of your floppy disk drive or
   the folder containing the file you downloaded from online services,
   and &lt;location&gt; is the path to your Msapps\Proof folder. For
   example, if you are installing from a floppy disk that you inserted
   in drive A, and C:\Windows\Msapps\Proof is the path to your
   Proofing Tools folder, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\msthes.dll c:\windows\msapps\proof
</PRE><P>
   Or, for example, if you downloaded the Wd1253.exe file from online
   services to C:\Download, and C:\Windows\Msapps\Proof is the path to
   your Proofing Tools folder, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\download\msthes.dll c:\windows\msapps\proof
</PRE>
<P><LI>When asked if you want to overwrite the existing copy of the file,
   answer Yes.

<P><LI>Restart Word.
<P>
</OL>Now when you use the Thesaurus in a 16-bit version of Word for Windows
with a non-U.S. version of Windows 95 or Windows NT, the Thesaurus
will correctly display synonyms.
