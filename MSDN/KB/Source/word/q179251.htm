The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following are OLE issues that you may encounter in Microsoft Word 98
Macintosh Edition:

<UL><LI>The OLE server object is not available in the Object dialog box (on the
   Insert menu, click Object).
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>You receive the following OLE server error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The server application, source file, or item cannot be found. Make
      sure the application is properly installed, and that it has not been
      deleted, moved, or renamed.
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>You are unable to edit an OLE object that exists in a document.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot OLE issues in Word 98, use the following workarounds in the
order specified. After you try a workaround, test the OLE application to
see if the problem is resolved.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Reinstall the OLE Application That Is Having the Problem</h3>
 
<P>
This is the preferred method to ensure proper registration. Because Office
98 Macintosh Edition does not include a maintenance mode Setup option, you
will need to run the Installer to reinstall the server application. Once
the installation is complete, the server application is re-registered.
<P>
For information about a method for reinstalling OLE applications, For
additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../OFFICE/Q179217.htm">Q179217</A></B>
   TITLE     : OFF98: Using First Run Installation to Troubleshoot Mac
               Office

</PRE><h3>Method 2: Double-click the OLE Server Application</h3>
 
<P>
Double-clicking the server application forces it to start, at which point
it is registered. Most of the OLE applications are located in the Microsoft
Office 98:Office folder.
<P>
An error message may be displayed informing you that the server application
must be started from within a program. If the error message does occur,
allow the server application to run, quit it, and then try running it from
within Microsoft Word 98.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3: Delete the Office Registration Cache File</h3>
 
<P>
The Office Registration Cache file is new to Office 98 Macintosh Edition.
This file, which contains OLE registration information about the Office 98
programs, is located in the System:Preferences folder. It is a combination
of information from the Settings file and the Registration Database files.
<P>
This file allows you to re-register Office programs without deleting the
registration databases. (You should always try to delete the Office
Registration Cache file before you try to delete the Registration
Database files.)
<P>
<P><h3>Method 4: Delete the Registration and PPC Registration Database Files</h3>
 
<P>
A last resort method for resolving Office 98 OLE server issues is to delete
the Registration Database and PPC Registration Database files. Do not
delete these files if you are having trouble with only a single OLE server
application. These files contain Registration information for non-Office
programs as well.
<P>
CAUTION: You should always make a back-up copy of these files before
you delete them.
<P>
When you install a program, Setup registers it in the Registration Database
and the PPC Registration Database files. These files are located in the
System:Preferences folder. The Registration Database and the PPC
Registration Database files also contain information about OLE 2.0
functionality.
<P>
NOTE: The Embedding Preferences file contains information regarding OLE 1.0
functionality. If you delete either the Registration Database, the PPC
Registration Database, or the Embedding Preferences file, the system
recreates the file when you start an OLE 1.0 or OLE 2.0 program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Rebuilding the Registration Database files will have the following effects:

<UL><LI>The ClipArt Gallery is not registered and will therefore be unavailable
   from PowerPoint. To work around this problem, re-install PowerPoint.

<LI>The Custom dictionary will be missing from Word. To re-establish the
   Custom dictionary, click Preferences on the Tools menu, click the
   Spelling And Grammar tab. Click Dictionaries, click Add, browse to the
   correct folder, and select the Custom dictionary. Click Open and then
   click OK.
