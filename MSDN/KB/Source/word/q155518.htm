The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you select multiple files in the File Open dialog box and click the Open
button, Word may not open all of the files. For example, if you select 50
files to be opened at the same time, Word may only open 35 of them.
<P>
If you select multiple files in the File Open dialog box, right click on
the files and click Print on the shortcut menu, Word may not print all of
the files. For example, if you select 50 files to be printed at the same
time, Word may only print 35 of them.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is a limit of 255 characters for the path and file name for all of
the files.
<P>
Under Windows 3.1x, the problem may also be a Windows resource limit.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Select the files in the Windows Explorer, right-click on the files,
   and click Open or Print from the shortcut menu.
<P>
   NOTE: Word should be open and running prior to using this method
   to print the documents. If Word is not open, a separate instance
   of Word will be opened and then closed for each document that is
   printed. This will cause a considerable amount of wasted time with
   large numbers of documents. However if Word is open at the time
   this process is started, then all of the documents will use the
   open instance of Word to print.

<LI>In Word, select fewer files to open or print.

<LI>If possible, move the files to a location with a shorter path, or
   shorten the file names.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The number of files that Word will open depends on the length of the
selected file names and their paths. If the file names or paths are longer,
fewer files can be opened.
<P>
In Word 6.0 for Windows, if you select multiple files, Word may not open
all of the files but this is due to limited system resources. In Word 7.0
and 97, the system resource limitation no longer exists; however there is a
255 character limitation on the length of the path and file name.
