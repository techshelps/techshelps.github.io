The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot fax problems that occur when you use Microsoft Fax to send
a fax from Word, use the methods described in the "More Information"
section of this article.
<P>
NOTE: Third-party faxing software is available for use with Microsoft
Word; however, Microsoft Technical Support can only support faxing from
Word when using Microsoft Fax.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To fully test your system's ability to communicate and function correctly
with your modem and Microsoft Fax, perform the steps in the order in which
they are listed here.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1: Test Windows Communications with Your Modem</h3>
 
<P>
To test whether Windows can communicate with your modem, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control
   Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Modems icon.

<P><LI>Click the Diagnostics tab, click the port at which you have your modem
   installed, and then click More Info. Windows will now attempt to
   communicate with your modem. Windows should display the following
   message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Communicating with modem. This may take a few minutes.
</PRE><P>
   Windows will send several "AT" commands to your modem. If these tests
   are successful, Windows will display the Port Information and "AT"
   responses for each command.
<P>
</OL>If the tests are successful, proceed to Step 2.
<P>
If any of the following problems occur, you may have either a modem, modem
configuration, or modem connection problem. If this is the case, refer to
the additional information articles at the end of this section.
<P>
Problems that may occur when you run the test:

<UL><LI>The COM port for your modem may not be listed as an available port.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You receive any of the following error messages:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The modem failed to respond. Make sure it is properly connected and
      turned on. If it is an internal modem or is connected, verify that
      the interrupt for the port is properly set.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The COM&lt;x&gt; port is currently assigned to an MS-DOS application. Do
      you want to reassign the port to Windows?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Another program is using the selected Telephony device. Try again
      after the other program completes.

<P>
<P><h3>Step 3: Test the Rendering System of Microsoft Fax from Word</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Make sure that the Send As Attachment option is turned off in Word.
To turn the Send As Attachment option off, click to clear the Send As
Attachment check box on the General tab. To view the General tab, click
Options on the Tools menu.

these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a document in Word. On the File menu, point to Send, and then
   click Mail Recipient.
<P>
   NOTE: If Send is not available on the File menu, you must install
   Microsoft Exchange using Windows 95 Setup.

<P><LI>In the New Message dialog box, the Word document will appear as text and
   the insertion point should be blinking in the To line.
<P>
   NOTE: To send your Word document as an attachment to the mail message,
   in Word, click Options on the Tools menu. On the General tab, click to
   select the Mail As Attachment check box, and then click OK.

<P><LI>In the To line, type "[fax:me]" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Use one of the following methods:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Method 1: With Microsoft Outlook Installed
      ------------------------------------------
</PRE>   
<P><PRE>      a. On the File menu, click Send Options.
</PRE>
