The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes known issues with macros included with the
supplemental templates shipped with Word for Windows and Word for the
Macintosh.
<P>
NOTE: These macros are not included in the international versions of Word,
with the exception of the French version.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For general information on the following macros, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>     ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q105765.htm">Q105765</A></B>
     TITLE     : Macros in the CONVERT, LAYOUT, TABLES, and MACRO60
                 Templates

</PRE><h3>Convert.dot</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>BatchConversion</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>During conversion, all files are automatically renamed with a .DOC
   extension. If you have multiple files with the same name, but which have
   different extensions, you will receive the following error message
   during the batch conversion:
<P>
<P><PRE>      A file of the same name exists in the target directory. Would you
      like to rename it or skip the file being converted.
</PRE><P>
   On the Macintosh, if you choose to rename the file, the macro does not
   save the file if a file with the same name already exists in the target
   folder.

<P><LI>Subdirectories located on a Novell NetWare server may not display. The
   root directory and up to one subdirectory of the network drive will
   appear, but no further subdirectories will be available. This happens
   when you select either a source or destination directory. For additional
   information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q115149.htm">Q115149</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : BatchConversion Macro Works Incorrectly on Novell
                  NetWare

</PRE><P><LI>If you are attempting to convert more than 500 files, you will receive
   the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Subscript out of Range
</PRE><P>
   The BatchConversion macro defines a 500-item static array that contains
   the names of the files in the source directory that you want to convert.
   The array cannot accommodate more than 500 files, so the error occurs if
   the number of files in the source directory exceeds that limit. For
   additional information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

                  Macro

</PRE></OL><h3>PresentIt</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>After you run the PresentIt macro in Word, a file named ~PRESENT.RTF
   will remain in the Windows TEMP directory. For additional information,
   please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : PresentIt Macro Leaves ~PRESENT.RTF in TEMP Directory

</PRE><P><LI>The PowerPoint manual instructs you to click the PresentIt button in
   Word. Since this button is not added to the Word toolbar automatically,
   you must manually add it. For additional information, please see the
   following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>

      TITLE     : Adding the Present It Tool to Word

</PRE><P><LI>The PresentIt macro is located in the following templates:
<P>
<PRE>      Template                    Word Version

<OL><P><LI>Applying uneven column formatting in a section by clearing the Equal

   width is the width of the first column specified in the macro dialog
   box. This problem was corrected in Word 6.0 for Windows NT.

<P><LI>Choosing the Help button and returning to the macro dialog box will
   cause extra column numbers to be displayed on the dialog box. This
   problem was corrected in Word 6.0 for the Macintosh and Word 6.0 for
   Windows NT.

<P><LI>The dialog box was changed in Word 6.0 for the Macintosh to fit on
   smaller monitors.

<P><LI>When you change the Page Orientation of a document with the macro, the
   macro gives the message "WordBasic Error = 100 Syntax Error".
<P>
   To resolve the problem, edit the SectionManager macro and change the
   line that reads
<P>
<P><PRE>      Case Else DlgText "TOrientation", S59$
</PRE><P>

called "Enable AutoBackup" that has not yet been added. Note that the
EnableAutoBackup and the DisableAutoBackup toggle on the opposite macro's
menu item on the File menu.
<P>
This error will not occur on subsequent executions of the macro.

   minimum number of sample fonts per page to prevent the printer from
   exhausting memory.
<P>
