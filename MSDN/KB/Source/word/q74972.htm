The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a

</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word for Windows, if you compile an index in several
parts (such as an index including a range of letters), Word inserts a
paragraph return between each of the separate parts. This occurs
whether or not you separate each of the index fields with a paragraph
return. Removing this paragraph mark deletes the entire index
reference.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Word for Windows User's Guide" recommends breaking up
an index that includes more than 4,000 entries into several parts.
This allows the updating of each part to be done one field at a time
and the computer's memory to be reused to update the next field. For
example, a complete index can be compiled from the following inserted
fields:
<P>
<PRE>   {index \p a-f}
   {index \p g-r}
   {index \p s-z}

</PRE>Note: To insert the field braces, press CTRL+F9.
<P>
These fields compile an entire index, with paragraph returns
automatically inserted between the result of each separate index
field. In the above example, a paragraph return is inserted between
the f and g entries of the index and between the r and s entries of
the index.
<P>
Note: Even if the fields are entered in the same paragraph (no
paragraph returns between fields), the index is still compiled with
paragraph returns between the individual parts.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open, and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Type the following lines of text:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a index
      c index
      x index
      z index
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select each line of text individually WITHOUT the corresponding
   paragraph mark. From the Insert menu, select Index Entry. Accept the
   defaults in the dialog box, and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Break, accept the default options, and
   choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Press CTRL+F9 to generate a pair of field code braces. Within the
   braces, type the INDEX field command, followed by the \p switch,
   followed by the range selection. It should appear as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {INDEX \p A-D}
</PRE>
<P><LI>Repeat the actions in step 6 to set up another index range for the
   remaining index entries. The result should appear as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {INDEX \p A-D}{INDEX \p E-Z}
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select these field codes, and press F9 to update them.

<P><LI>The result is a paragraph mark followed by the first index range
   and a second paragraph mark followed by the second index range.
   This occurs even though there are no paragraph marks involved with
   the index range entries.
<P>
</OL>Attempting to select either of these paragraph marks for deletion
fails. The paragraph marks are permanently associated with the index
range entries. You can work around this problem by manually inserting
the paragraph marks prior to updating the index range entries. If an
initial separation exists, the index range entry does not generate the
permanently associated paragraph marks. This should appear as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   [ENTER]
   {INDEX \p A-D} [ENTER]
   {INDEX \p E-Z}

</PRE></OL>where [ENTER] refers to pressing the ENTER key prior to each index
field entry.
<P>
The results are exactly the same as described in step 9 above;
however, you can delete the paragraph marks to make the index range
entries contiguous. Be aware that updating again generates a new set
of index references that include the permanent paragraph marks.
