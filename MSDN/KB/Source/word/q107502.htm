The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
MasterWord is an add-on program produced by ALKI software that enhances the
functionality of Word for Windows, adding additional tools, toolbar
buttons, and additional online help enhancements. MasterWord includes the
following enhancements and tools:

<UL><LI>Versatile and customizable floating toolbar
<LI>Customizable keyboard assignments of up to four letters long
<LI>MasterWord Manager, allowing ease in moving or copying of macros, styles
   and glossaries
<LI>Additional, useful macros
<LI>Extended File command capabilities such as additional features added to
   the File Open command
<LI>Template selector with additional buttons to choose desired templates
<LI>Built-in button editor
<P>
</UL><h2>Unistalling MasterWord</h2>
 
<P>
MasterWord installs a host of files onto your hard drive that will rename
WINWORD.HLP, WINHELP.EXE, and four DLL files that are installed into the
Windows directory. If rather than disabling an individual feature you want
to uninstall all of MasterWord, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Delete the contents of the MasterWord program directory (by default,
   C:\MASTER).

<P><LI>Delete the contents of the TEMPLATE subdirectory of the MasterWord
   program directory.

<P><LI>Delete from the C:\WINWORD\TEMPLATES directory the LANGUAGE.DOT,
   CONTROL.DOT, AND HANDY.DOT files. In Word version 2.x these files are
   found in the Word program directory.

<P><LI>Delete the WINWORD.HLP, CMDREF.HLP, AND MWTOOLS.HLP files from the Word
   program directory. Then restore the original version of the Word for
   Windows help file, either by renaming the file WINWORD0.HLP to
   WINWORD.HLP or by running Word's Setup program. (You are able to use the
   rename method only if you instructed MasterWord's Setup program to
   rename rather than delete Word's original help.)

<P><LI>Delete the following files from your Windows directory: MWAPPLIB.DLL,
   BUTTONED.DLL, MWHELP.DLL, AMAKEDIR.DLL, AND PATHBUTT.DLL.

<P><LI>If you are using Windows 3.0 rather than Windows 3.1, you may want to
   restore the 3.0 version of the Help program. To do this, delete
   WINHELP.EXE and WINHELP.HLP from your Windows directory, then rename the
   WINHELP.EX1 file WINHELP.EXE, and rename the WINHELP.HL1 file
   WINHELP.HLP. (This only works if MasterWord's Setup program renamed the
   files in the first place.)

<P><LI>Delete the NORMAL.DOT file in your Word directory, unless it contains
   non-MasterWord macros and assignments that you want to retain. If you
   want to keep your NORMAL.DOT file, delete from it the MasterWord macros
   listed in Chapter 6. You can also use the instructions on page 155 to
   remove unwanted menu and Toolbar assignments.
