The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Power Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1
<LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you start your Power Macintosh from the Disk Tools disk, you cannot
start Word version 6.0 for the Power Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When Word for the Power Macintosh starts, it looks for OLE files in the
Extensions folder of the active System. Since you are now using the System
on the Disk Tools disk, and this disk does not contain the OLE files, Word
cannot start.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Word also searches the application folder (the folder that contains Word)
for the OLE files. OLE files are not typically installed in this folder,
but if you place copies of these files there, Word will be able to start
even when a different System is active.
<P>
To boot from Disk Tools with Word 6.0 on a Power Macintosh:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the following required OLE files from the Extensions Folder to the
   application folder (the folder containing the Word icon):
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Dialog Library
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft OLE Library
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart the computer with Disk Tools.
<P>
   - If you are using the Disk Tools disk, place the disk in the floppy
<P><PRE>     drive and choose Restart from the Special menu.
</PRE><P>
   - If you have System CD version 1.0:
<P>
<PRE>        Insert the CD at startup.

   - If you have System CD version 2.0:

        With the CD inserted in the drive, start the machine while holding
        down the C key on the keyboard.

   Note: If you are using the Disk Tools CD-ROM, place the CD in the CD-ROM
   drive, choose Restart from the Special menu, and press and hold
   COMMAND+OPTION+SHIFT+DEL while the computer restarts.

   For more information please see the following article in the Microsoft 
   Knowledge Base:

      TITLE     : Booting a PowerMacintosh from the System CD

</PRE></OL>If you are testing a feature that requires OLE functionality (such as
embedding an Equation Editor object, linking to a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet, and so on), you may need to copy all of the OLE files to the
application folder. These files are the OLE files installed with Word 6.0:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Dialog Library

<LI>Microsoft OLE Extension

<LI>Microsoft OLE Library
<P>
</UL>There may be other OLE files that have been installed by other Office
applications.
<P>
Once you are finished troubleshooting, delete the extra OLE files from the
application folder so that the files don't take up extra space.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Restarting with the Disk Tools disk is a common method for troubleshooting
Word problems. If the problem persists with Word after starting the
computer this way, you can conclude that something is wrong with Word and
not with the System or Finder file on the hard disk.
<P>
While this is an effective method for troubleshooting problems with Word
for the Macintosh (the regular 68K version) running on the Power Macintosh,
booting from the Disk Tools disk will not help identify problems in the
Power Macintosh version of Word unless you copy the OLE files to the
application folder. The Power Macintosh version of Word requires the OLE
files in order to start; the 68K version of Word does not.
