<UL><LI>Microsoft Direct Mail Manager for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to print a mailing from Microsoft Direct Mail Manager, you
may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Error (5922) - Word was unable to open the data source.

   The error occurred when printing with Word. Please check your settings
   and try again.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word is attempting to use the ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)
Text driver to process a text data file that contains tabs, quotation
marks, or extended characters. For more information about why this happens,
see the "More Information" section of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Remove the ODBC Text Driver</h3>
 
<P>
This method allows Word to use its own text converter instead of the ODBC
Text Driver to read the data file. Use the following steps to remove the
ODBC Text driver:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Direct Mail Manager, Microsoft Word, and all Office
   programs, including the Office Shortcut Bar.

<P><LI>Click the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and click Control
   Panel. Click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>Click the Install/Uninstall tab.

<P><LI>Select Microsoft Office.
<P>
   The Microsoft Office Setup program will start.

<P><LI>Select Add/Remove from the Microsoft Office Setup program.

<P><LI>Select the Converters, Filters, and Data Access category. Click Change
   Options in the Setup dialog box.

<P><LI>Click once on the Data Access category and click Change Options.

<P><LI>Scroll down to the bottom of the drivers list and clear the Text Driver
   check box. Click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK or Continue until Setup has completed successfully. Click OK
   again and restart Microsoft Direct Mail Manager.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Submit the Mailing to a Mailing Service</h3>
 
<P>
Rather than printing the mailing out yourself, you can submit the mailing
to a mailing service and have them process the mailing for you. To do this,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Step 3 of the Microsoft Direct Mail Manager wizard gives you the
   following options:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Quick and Simple - First Class Mail
      Standard Mail
      Easy - Use a Mailing Service
      Do not print the mailing now.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Rather then printing the mailing yourself, you choose the third
   option "Easy - Use a Mailing Service" and have a Mailing Service
   perform the task for you.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 3: Perform the Merge from Microsoft Word</h3>
 
<P>
You can perform the merge process manually from Microsoft Word and choose
the type of data connectivity you want to use. That is, you can manually
choose to connect to the data file using the Text Converter rather the Text
ODBC driver and bypass some of the limitations of the Text ODBC driver. To
do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Word.

<P><LI>Follow these steps to create a mail merge main document (you can create
   form letters, envelopes, or labels):
<P>
   a. On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge.
<P>
   b. Click Create, and then click Form Letters, Envelopes, or Labels.
<P>
   c. Click new Main Document (or Active Window if the mail merge main
<P><PRE>      document is already open).
</PRE>
<P><LI>Attach the Mergedata.txt file, that Microsoft Direct Mail Manager
   created, as your data source using the text converter.
<P>
   a. In the Mail Merge Helper, click "Get Data and Open Data Source."
<P>
   b. Navigate to the Microsoft Direct Mail Manager folder. By default,
<P><PRE>      this is (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Direct Mail
      Manager).
</PRE><P>
   c. From the Files Of Type list, select Text Files.
<P>
   d. Click to select the Select Method check box.
<P>
   e. Click the Mergedata file and click Open.
<P>
   f. In the Confirm Data Source dialog box, click Text Files (*.txt) and
<P><PRE>      click OK.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Continue with the merge, adding merge fields as needed. Perform the
   merge, by either merging directly to the printer, or merging to a new
   document and then printing the new document.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Direct Mail Manager prints the mailing by connecting to Microsoft
Word using OLE Automation and handing the task off to Microsoft Word for
processing and printing. Microsoft Word will then connect to the data
source text file generated by Microsoft Direct Mail Manager and process the
request.
<P>
When using a text file as a data source, Microsoft Word can either connect
through a Text ODBC driver or a text converter. For performance reasons,
Microsoft Word will always attempt to use the Text ODBC driver to connect
to the data source, if the Text ODBC driver is installed. If the driver is
not installed, Word will use the text converter.
<P>
The Text ODBC driver that ships with Microsoft Office can process only
certain types of information. If the text file contains tab-delimited text,
comma and quote delimited text, or extended characters, you will receive
an error message saying that Word could not open the data source.
