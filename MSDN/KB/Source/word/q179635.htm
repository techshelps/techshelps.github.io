<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
During mail merges in Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition, you may want to
remove blank lines from the main document if no information is available
for that line.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Frequently in mail merges involving addresses, there is a second line for
the street address, which is normally used for a suite or apartment number.
In order to close the "gap" in the address when no data exists for that
merge field, make sure you do not place any spaces, punctuation, or
anything else except merge fields on that second line. If there is anything
else on that line, that line will appear in all merges.
<P>
The mail merge feature evaluates each line as the merge is performed. If
there is any text on the line, that line appears in the merge result. If
there is no text on the line, but there is a merge field, it checks to see
if there is any data for the merge field. If there is no data for the merge
field, it does not create that line in the merge result.
<P>
To change this feature setting, follow these steps:
<P>
NOTE: You must be in the mail merge Main (form) document to change the
setting for the merge.

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge.

<P><LI>In the Mail Merge Helper dialog box, click Merge.
<P>
   NOTE: You must have already selected the main document and data source
   for the merge.

<P><LI>In the Merge dialog box, under When Merging Records, click either:
<P>
<P><PRE>      "Don't print blank lines when data fields are empty."
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      "Print blank lines when data fields are empty."
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click close in the Merge dialog box, and then click Close in the Mail
   Merge Helper.
<P>
   NOTE: If you made no changes in the Merge dialog box, the Close button
   is not available. Click Cancel instead.
<P>
