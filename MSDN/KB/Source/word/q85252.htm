The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Legal Resource Kit (LRK) was created for people in the
legal industry who use Microsoft Word version 2.0 for Windows. The LRK
works with Word versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0-CD, 2.0b, and 2.0c only; it
does not work with earlier versions of Word for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
The Legal Resource Kit has been discontinued and is no longer available
from Microsoft. Support is not provided for this product.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Legal Resource Kit included the following items:

<UL><LI>Lexis 2000 for Windows software. Lexis 2000 is an online legal
   research database service provided by Mead Data Central. Customers are
   charged for the time that they are logged on to the service. Lexis is a
   very popular service. Lexis 2000 for Windows contains macros that
   integrate Lexis with Word for Windows. These macros allow you to
   conduct your Lexis research directly from within Word for Windows. The
   results of your research are pasted into a Word for Windows document,
   where you can edit, save, or copy the material as needed. Lexis 2000
   for Windows does not work with WordPerfect or Westlaw (another legal
   research database service).

<LI>An improved table of authorities macro and documentation. This is an
   updated version of the TableOfAuthorities macro that ships with Word
   version 2.0 for Windows in the NEWMACRO.DOC file. The documentation
   dramatically increases the usefulness of this macro.

<LI>PLEADING.DOT and CONTRACT.DOT templates. The PLEADING.DOT template
   replaces the BRIEF.DOT template, supplied with early releases of
   the Legal Resource Kit. These templates are improved versions of
   the BRIEF.DOT and CONTRACT.DOT supplied with Word version 1.1.

<LI>The "Self-Guided Tour of the Legal Features in Word for Windows."
   This is a 25-page document, complete with sample files for the
   tour.

<LI>A coupon for a legal dictionary made specifically for use with Word
   version 2.0 for Windows by Alki Software.

<LI>A coupon for DocuComp, a third-party product that compares document
   versions. DocuComp can read Word for Windows version 2.0 files. This
   product uses a wide variety of revision mark options to display
   insertions, deletions, moves, and other differences between two
   versions of a document. With DocuComp, you can either use predefined
   delimiters or create custom delimiters. In addition, DocuComp offers a
   wider range of revision mark options than the Tools Revision Marks
   command in Word.
