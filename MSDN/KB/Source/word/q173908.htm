The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word 97, when you try to open a file, the file does not open,
and you may receive one or more of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>The Word work file and memory are nearly full. Save your work.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>There is not enough memory or disk space to complete the operation.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>There is insufficient memory or disk space. Close extra windows and
   save your work.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>There is insufficient memory or disk space. Close an application.
   (&lt;path&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;)
<P>
   -or-

<LI>This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut
   down.
<P>
   If this problem persists, contact the program vendor.
<P>
   When you click Details, the following message is displayed:
<P>
   WINWORD caused an invalid page fault in module WINWORD.EXE at
   0137:3007ead6.
<P>
</UL>Or, Word may stop responding.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is insufficient random access memory (RAM) on your computer or
insufficient disk space available for Word to open the file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem in the short-term, use either of the following
methods.

<UL><LI>As a short-term solution, you can free RAM memory by quitting unneeded
   programs, or you can free disk space by deleting unneeded files.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Restart Windows. To do this, on the Start menu, click Shut Down. In the
   Shut Down Windows dialog box, click Restart The Computer, and then click
   Yes.
<P>
</UL>To prevent this problem from occurring in the long-term, use either of the
following methods.

<UL><LI>Add more RAM memory to your computer.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Acquire more hard disk space, either by adding a larger disk drive
   or by using a disk compression utility.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: When troubleshooting these problems, ensure that there are no other
programs active and that there is a minimum of 20MB of free hard disk
space. As a general guideline, 20MB of free space is enough to work with
Word files. However, if you frequently work with large documents (10MB or
more) you may need to free some additional space.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
