The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SGML Author for Word, version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In an SGML-tagged document opened Microsoft Word 6.0 for Windows,
underscores appear in the place of some characters.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Any character that the SGML converter does not recognize is converted to an
underscore (_).
<P>
SGML Author supports the ANSI, Wingdings, and Symbol character sets. ANSI,
Wingdings, or Symbol characters inserted into your document must also have
identical symbols in the ISO Character Entity declarations in order to be
output correctly on import or export. Other character sets are more likely
to have characters that will convert as an underscore.
<P>
Symbol font characters that do not have a matching ISO Character Entity
declaration are output as an underscore. These characters include:
<P>
<PRE>   Filled diamonds (#168)
   Set membership with bar (#207)
   Upper/lower left arcs (#230, #232)
   Upper/middle/lower, left curly brackets (#236, #237, #238)
   Upper/lower integral sign (#243, #245)
   Upper/lower right arcs (#246, #248)
   Upper/middle/lower, right curly brackets (#252, #253, #254)

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Insert the character that did not convert from the Wingdings font set. To
insert the character, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Symbol.

<P><LI>Choose the Symbols tab.

<P><LI>In the Font box, select Wingdings.

<P><LI>Choose the symbol you want and choose Insert.
<P>
</OL>IMPORTANT: The Wingdings character you use must have a matching ISO
Character Entity declaration or it will be translated as an underscore.
<P>
Also, check that the PATH statement in the ENTM.CAT file specifies the
actual location of your Wingdings ISO Character Entity declarations file
(WINGDING.PUB).
<P>
The ISO Character Entity declaration statement in your ENTM.CAT file should
look like the following:
<P>
<PRE>   PUBLIC "-//Microsoft Corp//ENTITIES for MS Wingdings//EN" "WINGDING.PUB"

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The converter can always convert any character below 127 in the ANSI
character set. And if you reference the ISO character sets WINGDING.PUB,
WINGDING.CCF, and WINSYM.CCF in your DTD, the following symbols in a Word
document can be converted to character entities in the SGML instance:
<P>
<PRE>   Characters above 127 in the ANSI character set
   Characters in the Wingdings font
   Characters in the Symbol font

</PRE>When the SGML instance is converted to Word, the character entity is
converted to the referenced character and marked with the currently open
style. For example, the "e" with the acute accent in the word "resume" is
converted to "resum&amp;eacute" in the SGML instance. When the file is opened
in Word, the correct character displays.
<P>
Symbol characters are converted to SYMBOL fields in Word. For example, the
copyright symbol is converted to the following SYMBOL field:
<P>
<PRE>   {SYMBOL 211 \f "SYMBOL" \s 12 \h}

</PRE>If your DTD uses any of the following items, examine SKELETON.dtd (usually
located in the C:\WINWORD\SGMLCONV\SAMPLE directory) to see how to
construct a DTD that will work with SGML Author:

<LI>Equations
