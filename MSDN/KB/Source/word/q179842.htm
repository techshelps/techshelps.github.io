The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open documents created in WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS in Microsoft
Word 6.x, there are differences in pagination.
<P>
This behavior occurs most often in double-spaced documents created in
WordPerfect that contain line numbering, such as legal pleading documents.
Line spacing increases significantly and the text appears slightly larger,
which causes differences in line endings, line spacing, number of lines per
page, and page breaks.
<P>
This behavior can also be seen when switching default printers on the same
computer with the document open on the screen.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Pagination varies depending on the printer driver you set as the default in
Word. For example, if a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet II or III series
driver is selected when opening the WordPerfect document, the pagination
will be different for the converted document than it would be if an HP
LaserJet 4 or 5 series driver is set as the default.
<P>
The behavior is attributed to the differences in 300-dpi (dots per inch)
and 600-dpi printer drivers. The HP LaserJet II and III series drivers are
300-dpi drivers. The HP LaserJet 4 and 5 series drivers are 600-dpi
drivers.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Follow these steps to set the HP LaserJet 4 or 5 series printer driver to
print 300 dpi:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Print.

<P><LI>Click Printer, and then click Options.

<P><LI>In the Resolution list, click "300 dots per inch."

<P><LI>Click OK, and then click Close.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>The document will paginate and print the same as it would if an HP II or
III series printer driver was selected as the default driver.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The documents will paginate the same if you open them on a computer with
either a default HP LaserJet II or III series printer driver; however, if
you open the same document on a computer with a default HP LaserJet 4 or 5
series printer driver, the pagination is significantly different and
slightly longer. For example, 28 double-spaced lines fit on a page in the
document opened with an HP LaserJet II or III driver, but only 25 double-
spaced lines fit on a page if the document is opened with an HP LaserJet 4
or 5 driver.
