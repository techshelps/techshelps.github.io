The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you click the File menu, some of the files on the Most Recently Used
File list (MRU) at the bottom of the File menu are shown with their full
path location, while other files show only the filename.
<P>
Word determines whether to show the full path based on whether the files
are in the folder that is opened when you click Open on the File menu.
Those files which are located in that folder are shown with only their file
names; all others are shown with the full path and file names.
<P>
There is no option to change whether Word displays the full path of
documents on the MRU list.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The MRU shows the last files that were actually used in Word. The most
recently used file is at the top of the list, while the least recently used
file is at the bottom of the list.
<P>
When you open a file in Word and then close it, it is added to the MRU for
easy retrieval. The MRU is a pointer to where Word can find the file.
<P>
The MRU list can be changed so that only a certain number of files show up
on the list. By default, the last four most recently used files will be on
the list. You can choose to have from one to nine files on the MRU list, or
the MRU list can be turned off completely.
<P>
To change the MRU list, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the General tab.

<P><LI>Under the General Options, select the Recently Used File List option. In
   the Entries box, choose the number of files you want displayed on the
   MRU list. Or, clear the Recently Used File list option if you don't want
   any files displayed.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The changes made to the MRU options above are saved to the
Winword.opt file in Word 6.0 or to the Windows Registry in Word 7.0 and
Word 6.0 for Windows NT. If the Winword.opt file, or the Data key in the
Windows Registry is renamed or deleted, then the changes will be lost and
will revert to the default setting of four files listed on the MRU list.
