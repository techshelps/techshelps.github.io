<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you delete a file from the Listed Files box in the Find File dialog
box after you perform a search based on Containing Text criteria, Word
for Windows appears to delete that file plus all subsequent files and
subdirectories in the list.
<P>
Furthermore, if you delete the first file in the list, Word appears to
delete all listed files and directories and displays the following
error message: "No matching files found." (To locate the Containing
Text search setting, choose Find File from the File menu. Choose the
Search button, then choose the Advanced Search button, and select the
Summary tab.)
<P>
This does not happen if you delete a file after you perform a search
based on another criterion, such as Title, Author, Keywords, or
Subject.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Although Word does not actually delete the files or subdirectories,
they are no longer cached in memory. As a result, the
CountFoundFiles() and FoundFilesName$() WordBasic functions do not
find these files. If you rebuild the file list, Word once again caches
the files and displays them in the Listed Files.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word for
Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Refresh the Listed Files box in the File Find File dialog box using
the following instructions:

<OL><P><LI>Choose the Search button.

<P><LI>In the Search dialog box, select the Rebuild File List option and
   then choose OK.
<P></OL>
