<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains in detail the syntax and usage of the operators
and functions that are available to the Expression (Formula) field.
<P>
In Word versions 6.x and later, the Expression field name was changed to 
Formula. Also, the Formula field name was changed in version 6.x to 
Equation.
<P>
<PRE>   1.x, 2.x                 6.x, 7.x, 97, 98 Macintosh Edition
   Field Name               Field Name
   -------------------      -----------------------

   = (Expression)           = (Formula)
   Eq (Formula)             Eq (Equation)

</PRE><h2>OPERATORS</h2>
 
<P>
If you combine several operators in one field, Word evaluates the 
information in the following order:
<P>
<PRE>   1. %        Percent
   2. ^        Exponentiation
   3. * and /  Multiplication and division
   4. + and -  Addition and subtraction

</PRE>In formulas with more than one operator with the same priority, Word
evaluates the operators from left to right. Use parentheses if you
want to alter the order of evaluations.
<P>
<PRE>   +   Addition           Syntax: {=x+y}

   -   Subtraction        Syntax: {=x-y}

                          NOTE: {=x--y} is the same as {=x+y}. An even
                          number of subtraction signs is equivalent to
                          one addition sign.

   *   Multiplication     Syntax: {=x*y}

   /   Division           Syntax: {=x/y}

   %   Percentage         Syntax: {=x%}
                                  {=25%} = .25
                                  {=200*25%} = 50

   ^   Powers and roots   Raise a number to another power
                          or find a root of a number.
                          Syntax: {=x^y}
                                  {=4^2} = 16  4 squared
                                  {=3^3} = 27  3 Cubed
                                  {=27^(1/3)} = 3 Cube root of 27

</PRE><h2>TABLE COLUMN REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Word 6.x, 7.x, 97, and Word 98 Macintosh Edition</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: Word for Windows versions 6.x, 7.x, 97, and 98 use A1 reference 
   types to refer to cells. It does not use RnCn reference types.

   Bookmarkname  [D4]        Cell D4 in table identified by
                             bookmarkname.

   Bookmarkname  [D4:J17]    Range of cells identified by
                             bookmarkname.

   ABOVE, BELOW, LEFT, RIGHT can be used with the table functions
   (AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN, PRODUCT, SUM).

</PRE><h3>Word 1.x, 2.x</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: n is used to indicate the row or column number.

   [RnCn]                    Cell in Row n, Column n.

   [Rn]                      All cells in Row n.

   [Cn]                      All cells in Column n.

   [R]                       Row that the formula is in, including the
                             current cell.

   [C]                       Column that the formula is in, including
                             the current cell.

   [RnCn:RnCn]               Range of all cells between the two cell
                             references.

   Bookmarkname  [RnCn]      Cell in table identified by bookmarkname.

   Bookmarkname  [RnCn:RnCn] Range of cells identified by
                             bookmarkname.

</PRE><h2>FUNCTIONS</h2>
 
<P>
Functions with () can take any number of arguments. If the arguments
have more than two digits, you must put a space in front of each.
<P>
There are five Boolean functions, which return a value of 1 (true) or
0 (false): NOT, OR, AND, FALSE, TRUE.
<P>
The following list provides information about the available functions for 
use in Word:
<P>
Note: the AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, COUNT, PRODUCT, SUM functions can refer to 
cells in a table.
<P>
<PRE>    ABS(x)      Returns the absolute value of a number. The absolute
               value of a number is the number without its sign.

               {=ABS(3.5)} = 3.5
               {=ABS(-3.5)} = 3.5

   AND(x,y)    Returns "1" if both arguments are true. Returns "0" if
               both arguments are false. Mostly used with IF
               statements.

               {=AND(profits&gt;1000, profits&lt;2000)} = 1 when "profits"
               has been defined as $1,234. The same formula returns 0
               when profits has been defined as $2,234.

               {=IF(AND(profits&gt;1000,profits&lt;2000),13,15)} = 13 when
               profits has been defined as $1,234. The same formula
               returns "15" when profits has been defined as $2,234.

   AVERAGE()   Gives the average value of the numbers in the list.

               {=AVERAGE(10, 20, 60)} = 30 {=AVERAGE([RnCn],[RnCn])}

   COUNT()     Tells you how many items are in the list.

               {=COUNT(2, 5, 67, 1.38)} = 4
               {=COUNT([RnCn],[RnCn],[RnCn],[RnCn])}

   DEFINED(x)  Returns "1" (true) if x has been defined, “0" (false)
               if it has not.

               {=DEFINED(4/0)} = 0
               {=DEFINED(gross_income)} = 1 if gross_income exists and
               it evaluates without error.

   FALSE       Returns a 1 if true or a 0 if true.

               {=FALSE} = 0
               {=IF(5=6,TRUE,FALSE)} = 0


   IF(x,y,z)   The result y if the conditional expression x is true, or the
               result z if the conditional expression is false. Note that y
               and z is usually 1 and can be either any numberic value or
               the words "true" or "false".

   INT(x)      Rounds x down to the nearest integer.

               {=INT(5.67)} = 5

   MAX()       Returns the largest value in the list.

               {=MAX(3, 4, 5)} = 5
               {=MAX([RnCn],[RnCn],[RnCn])}

   MIN()       Returns the smallest value in the list.

               {=MIN(3, 4, 5)} = 3
               {=MIN([RnCn],[RnCn],[RnCn])}

   MOD(x,y)    Returns the remainder (modulus) after x is divided by y.
               The result has the same sign as y. If the answer is 0,
               returns "0.0" (without quotation marks).

               {=MOD(4, 2)} = 0.0
               {=MOD(3, 2)} = 1
               {=MOD(-3, 2)} = 1
               {=MOD(3, -2)} = -1
               {=MOD(-3, -2)} = -1
               {=MOD(3.5, 2.7)} = 0.8

   NOT(x)      Returns the Boolean opposite of the result. Mostly used
               with IF formulas.

               {=NOT(1=1)} = 0
               {=NOT(1=5)} = 1
               If x is defined as 7, 7{=NOT(x&gt;10)} = 1

   OR(x,y)     Returns "1" if one or both arguments are true. Returns
               "0" if both arguments are false. Generally used with IF
               formulas.

               {=OR(1+2=3, 2=4)} = 1
               {=OR(1+5=3, 2=4)} = 0

   PRODUCT()   Multiplies all the items in the list.

               {=PRODUCT(5,4,3)} = 60 {=PRODUCT(5,4,3,(1/2))} = 30
               {=PRODUCT([RnCn],[RnCn],[RnCn])}

   ROUND(x,y)  Rounds x to y digits. If y is greater than 0, then x is
               rounded down to y decimal places.

               If y is 0, x is rounded down to the nearest integer.

               If y is a negative number, x is rounded down to the
               left of the decimal point.

               {=ROUND(x,y)}
               {=ROUND(123.456, 2)} = 123.46
               {=ROUND(123.456, 1)} = 123.5
               {=ROUND(123.456, 0)} = 123
               {=ROUND(123.456, -0)} = 123
               {=ROUND(123.456, -1)} = 120
               {=ROUND(123.456, -2)} = 100
               {=ROUND(156.789, -2)} = 200

               y is zero. Rounds x to the nearest integer.
               {=ROUND(123.456, 0)} = 123

               y is positive. Rounds to y decimal places.
               {=ROUND(123.456, 2)} = 123.46
               {=ROUND(123.456, 1)} = 123.5

               y is negative. Rounds x to that number of places to the
               left of the decimal. Y must not be greater than 1
               minus the number of digits in x. "-1" rounds to the
               nearest tens place, "-2" rounds to the nearest hundreds
               place, "-3" rounds to the nearest thousands place.

               {=ROUND(123.456, -0)} = 123
               {=ROUND(123.456, -1)} = 120
               {=ROUND(123.456, -2)} = 100
               {=ROUND(156.789, -2)} = 200

   SIGN(x)     Determines whether a number is positive (returns 1) or
               negative (returns -1) or zero (returns 0). Mostly used
               with the IF field.

               {=SIGN(-25)} = -1
               {=SIGN(0)} = 0
               {=SIGN(456)} = 1

   SUM()       Adds the numbers in the list.

               {=SUM(5, 13, 2, 4, 6)} = 30 {=SUM(5, 13, -2, 4, -6)} = 14
               {=SUM([RnCn],[RnCn],[RnCn])}

   TRUE        Returns a 1 if true or a 0 if false.

               {=TRUE} = 1
