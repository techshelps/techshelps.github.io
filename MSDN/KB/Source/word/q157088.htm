</PRE><h3>Cannot Edit a Word Document Embedded Object in Word 95</h3>
 
<P>
When you insert a Word document as an embedded object in a document in Word
97, save the document in the Word 6.x/95 format or Rich Text Format, and
then open the document in Word 95, you may receive the error message "Word
cannot edit the object" when you double-click the object to edit it. This
occurs because when you save the document created in Word 97 in the Word
6.x/95 format or Rich Text Format, the embedded object is not saved as a
Word 95 document object. To edit the object, you must have Word 97
installed on your computer.
<P>
Cannot Edit an Embedded Object Created
<P><h3>in a Word 95 Document after Saving in Word 97</h3>
 
<P>
If you create an embedded object in a Word 95 document, open the document
in Word 97, and then save the document in Word 6.x/95 format or Rich Text
Format, the embedded object is updated to a later version of the OLE object
server program on the computer running Word 97. If you reopen the document
in Word 95 on a computer that does not have Word 97 or Office 97 installed,
you may not be able to edit the object.
<P>
This can occur with any OLE object, including objects created in Word 97
documents. To see a list of OLE server programs installed on your computer,
view the list in the Object dialog box (Insert Menu).
