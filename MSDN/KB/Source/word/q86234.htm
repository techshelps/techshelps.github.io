</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
The Word 5.0a Patcher included on the enclosed MW0554 disk is for use
with version 5.0 of Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, and is not needed
with version 5.1 as the problem has been fixed. This program
corrects a problem with Word 5.0 that occurs when you exchange files
between different Macintosh computers. This problem results in fonts
being changed to the default font.
<P>
The Word 5.0a Patcher corrects the Word program and identifies your
version as Word 5.0a rather than Word 5.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Running the Patcher</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you are running Word, choose Quit from the File menu.

<P><LI>Insert the MW0554 disk in the disk drive.

   NOTE: If you are running Gatekeeper, you must disable it before
   running the patcher. To do this, choose Control Panels from the
   Apple menu, double-click the Gatekeeper pane, select On/Off, and
   click the Off switch.
