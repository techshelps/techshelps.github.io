 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

</PRE>This is a description of the new features in Microsoft Word version
5.1 for the Macintosh. If you have already upgraded to Word version
5.1, you can find this information in the "What's New in Microsoft
Word Version 5.1" manual. If you do not own a previous version of Word
for the Macintosh and want general information about the product, call
Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400. If you are outside
the United States, contact the Microsoft subsidiary for your area. To
locate your subsidiary, call Microsoft International Customer Service
at (425) 936-8661.
<P>
<P><h3>The Toolbar</h3>
 
<P>
The Toolbar gives you one-click access to the Word commands you use
most often. For example, you can click a button on the Toolbar to
open, save, or print a document. You can also click buttons to create
envelopes and bulleted lists.
<P>
You can position the Toolbar where it is most convenient for your work
--horizontally across the top of the screen or vertically along the
left or right side of the screen. You can also customize the Toolbar
by replacing the original, or default, buttons with the buttons that
are most useful for the particular work you do. The Toolbar holds up
to 30 buttons that you can customize with your choice of more than 150
button faces and 300 Word commands.
<P>
<P><h3>Bulleted List</h3>
 
<P>
When you click the Bulleted List button on the Toolbar (or choose
Bullet from the Insert menu), Word adds a bullet to any selected
paragraphs and applies hanging indent formatting. Each time you want
to add an item to a bulleted list, just click the Bulleted List
button.
<P>
<P><h3>New Table Button on Ribbon</h3>
 
<P>
We've added a Table button to the ribbon. You can use the Table button
to easily insert a table, convert existing text into a table, or to
insert cells, rows, and columns into a table.
<P>
Create Envelope
 
<P>
The Create Envelope button on the Toolbar (or the Create Envelope
command on the Tools menu) provides an easy way to create envelopes
and to store addresses. Word can automatically format and print
envelopes in 11 different sizes. Word even inserts your return address
automatically.
<P>
<P><h3>Find File Command</h3>
 
<P>
We've improved the Find File command so you can now search for files
in a specified folder instead of searching an entire drive. You can
search by filename, keywords, author, or date of creation. You can
also preview, sort, and print without opening files, and you can copy
text from the Find File preview window and paste it into an open
document.
<P>
<P><h3>Print Odd or Even Numbered Pages</h3>
 
<P>
We've added an odd-only and even-only feature to the Print command to
make it easier for you to print on both sides of the paper. You can
use the odd-only option to print all the odd-numbered pages and then
use the even-only option to print all the even-numbered pages on the
backs of the odd pages.
<P>
<P><h3>Spelling Checker Enhancements</h3>
 
<P>
The spelling checker is more powerful than ever, thanks to these
improvements:

<UL><LI>The spelling checker returns to your document more quickly after
   you add words to a custom dictionary and close the Spelling dialog
   box.

<LI>You can use the Ignore All button to tell the spelling checker to
   ignore all instances of a selected word during the current spelling
   check and any other spelling checks you conduct until you quit
   Word.

<LI>Word gives you more feedback on the progress of a spelling check by
   displaying a message stating that Word is loading the spelling
   dictionaries. Word also indicates the percentage of the spelling
   check that has been completed in the lower-left corner of the
   document window.
<P>
</UL><h3>New or Improved File Converters</h3>
 
<P>
Word 5.1 includes a new converter for Microsoft Excel. In addition,
Word 5.1 includes the following upgraded converters:

<UL><LI>WordPerfect(R) version 5.x for MS-DOS
<LI>MacWrite(R) II
<LI>Windows(TM) Metafile graphics
<P>
</UL><h3>Group Tool Added to Picture Window</h3>
 
<P>
When you create a picture composed of several elements, you can now
group those elements together using the new group tool. The individual
elements become in effect a single element that you can easily move or
scale. If you later decide to modify the picture, you can ungroup the
elements and work on the particular element you want to change.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating Drop Caps</h3>
 
<P>
You can set off the first letter in a paragraph by creating a
"dropped" capital letter, commonly called a "drop cap." The Drop Cap
command in Word 5.1 creates two kinds of drop caps: those that drop
into a paragraph, wrapped by text, and those that drop into the margin
beside a paragraph.
<P>
<P><h3>Text Annotations</h3>
 
<P>
Using the new Annotation command, you can add pop-up comments to your
document. Annotations are particularly useful for documents that you
want to distribute for others to review and comment. Annotations make
online reviewing easier for both the reviewer and the author because
annotations do not disrupt the original text, and you can view
comments and text at the same time. After the author reviews the
annotations, he or she can incorporate them into the document or
delete them.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating Charts with Microsoft Graph</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Graph is a separate program, supplied with Word 5.1, that
you run from within Word. Using Microsoft Graph, you can easily create
a chart to embed in your Word document. You can use data from a Word
table to create a chart by selecting all or part of the table and then
clicking the Graph button on the Toolbar. Microsoft Graph offers 12
types of charts, including area, bar, column, pie, 3D, and line.
<P>
<PRE>  NOTE: You must have Apple(R) System 7(TM) software to run Microsoft
  Graph.

</PRE><h3>Checking Battery Usage in the Apple Macintosh PowerBook(R)</h3>
 
<P>
When you install Word on an Apple Macintosh PowerBook, Word provides a
battery power indicator on the ruler so you can see how much power is
available without leaving Word.
<P>
<P><h3>Playing Movies in Word</h3>
 
<P>
If your Macintosh model supports Apple QuickTime(TM), you can add
sound, video, and animation to your Word documents. Using the Movie
command, you can insert an existing QuickTime movie in a document as
easily as you can copy and paste text and graphics.
<P>
<P><h3>Apple System 7 Support</h3>
 
<P>
Word 5.1 fully supports System 7, which means you can use TrueType(R)
fonts; exchange information using Publish and Subscribe, linking, and
embedding; share files over a network; and use the stationery format
to create document templates.
<P>
<P><h3>System Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
To run Word 5.1, you need:

<UL><LI>Macintosh Plus, SE, Classic(R), Portable, PowerBook, LC, II-family,
   or Macintosh Quadra(TM) personal computer

<LI>One 800K disk drive and a hard disk

<LI>System 6.0.2 to 6.0.8 (Microsoft Graph requires System 7 or later),
   Finder(TM) 6.1 or higher, minimum of 1 megabyte (MB) of memory (2
   MB required for use with the grammar checker)
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE><P>
   System 7, minimum of 3 MB of memory (4 MB recommended for use with
   the Toolbar or grammar checker)
