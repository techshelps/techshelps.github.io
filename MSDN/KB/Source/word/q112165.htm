The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you modify two different words that are located less than 10 (This
number may vary) characters apart and then use the Compare Versons\
Documents command to compare the 'before the modifications' copy of the
document to the 'after the modifications' copy of the document, both
modified words will be completely marked out with a strikethrough and
the modified versions of the words will be shown as inserted.
<P>
However, if the two modified words are located more than 10 characters
(this number ay vary) apart, each word will be shown as a separate
modification.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This functionality is by design. It is a limit to the granularity to which
Word can apply revision marking.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Word interprets revisions based on the distance between two revisions.
Based on the distance, Word interprets the revisions as separate revisions
or as one complete revision. If you have ten characters (this number may
vary) and a space somewhere between the two revised items, Word will mark
the changes with two separate revision marks. If you have fewer than ten
characters (this number may vary) or no space between the items being
revised, Word will mark the changes with only one revision mark.
<P>
To see an example of this feature, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In a new document, type "large balloon" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Save the document as Original.doc.

<P><LI>Change "large" to "Large" and change "balloon" to "balloons."

<P><LI>Save as Rev.doc.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Revisions, and then select Compare Versions
   and choose Original.doc.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Word treats the two changes as one revision.

<OL><P><LI>Close Rev.doc without saving changes and open Original.doc

<P><LI>Change "large balloon" to "large and colorful balloon," and save the
   file as Original.doc.

<P><LI>Change "large" to "Large" and change "balloon" to "balloons".

<P><LI>Save the file as Rev.doc. Then, on the Tools menu, click Revisions, and
   click Compare Versions. Choose Original.doc.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Because there are more than ten characters and at least one space
between the two words being revised, Word treats the revisions as
separate items.
