The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You delete text or fields (such as a PAGE field) in the header or footer of
a section, but the header or footer still appears to contain text or field
results (such as a page number).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you format a section with the "Same As Previous" ("Link to Previous" in
versions earlier than 6.0) option selected, the header or footer for this
section will be the same as the one for the previous section. If a header
or footer is blank, the Same As Previous option is turned on automatically.
<P>
This means that if, for example, you are trying to remove page numbers from
a section and the page numbers are the only thing in the header or footer,
then when the page number is deleted, the Same As Previous option will be
automatically activated, and the header or footer from the previous section
will take effect.
<P>
Since the header or footer from the previous section is usually a page
number field also, it often appears that removing the PAGE field earlier
did not work. If you remove the PAGE field again, Word automatically turns
on Same As Previous and brings in the PAGE field again. This loop will
continue as many times as it is tried. Therefore, it commonly appears that
you cannot create the blank header or footer.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To successfully create the blank header or footer, instead of simply
deleting the text or field, replace the text or field with a space (select
the header or footer and press the SPACEBAR once). The space will be seen
as text in the header/footer and prevent the Same As Previous option from
being automatically engaged.
