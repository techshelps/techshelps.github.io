The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 for Windows creates temporary files necessary for the
conversion of Word for Windows documents into other file formats. To
successfully convert a Word document, you must have enough available
disk space to accommodate the temporary file, the normal document file,
and the final converted file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The size and number of these files will vary with the size and type of
the Word document you are converting. The drive containing the
temporary (TEMP) directory (specified in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file by
SET TEMP=) will require the most space. The drive where the file is
saved will require enough space for the final converted file. If a
drive does not contain adequate space, a "Cannot write file" error
will occur.
<P>
Documents containing OLE objects ("compound documents") require extra
temporary files to store the objects for conversion. The process of
conversion is as follows (steps required for compound documents are
denoted by "*").
<P>
After you specify a name and select an alternative file format in the
File Save As dialog box, and choose the OK button, the following
occurs:

<OL><P><LI>Word creates a temporary file in the TEMP directory. This file is
    the document in rich-text format (RTF).
<P>
</OL>*2. The converter reads this file and creates a temporary file to
<PRE>    store OLE objects for conversion. This file is stored in the TEMP
    directory. The size of this file is dependent upon the number and
    type of OLE objects.

</PRE><P><LI>The converter creates the final output file in the specified
    format. This file is located in the drive and directory specified
    in File Save As dialog box.

<P><LI>Word deletes the temporary file created in step 1.
<P>
</OL>*5. The converter creates a temporary file to store OLE objects that
<PRE>    were saved in the final output file. This file is located in the
    TEMP directory.

    Word accesses OLE objects via the OLE docfiles** specification. At
    this point the converted document is still open in Word.
    Therefore, Word must create a file in the docfiles format so that
    objects can be displayed or activated.

    When the document is closed, the temporary file is deleted.

</PRE></OL>*6. Word deletes the temporary file created in step 2.
<P>
**"Docfiles" is a file format, specified by the OLE 2.0 specification,
<PRE>  that allows for the implementation of OLE processes. In this format
  objects are saved in "data streams" (similar in concept to
  subdirectories of main directories in the MS-DOS file model) separate
  from the main application file stream.

</PRE>Converting a file (not of Word 6.0 format) by opening it within Word
causes the creation of a temporary file (step 5) if the originating
file contains OLE objects.
