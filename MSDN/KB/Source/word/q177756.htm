The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a file with a large Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)
graphic in it as RTF (Rich Text Format), you may receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   There is not enough memory or disk space to complete the operation.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You have one or more large JPEG graphics in the document, and Word does not
have enough memory allocated to it to perform the proper conversion.
<P>
When saving a document that has a JPEG graphic in it as RTF, the graphic is
converted to a picture (PICT) file format and the size of the graphic may
increase dramatically.
<P>
NOTE: The Macintosh operating system cannot automatically allocate more
memory to an application as it is required.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, increase the memory partition for the Word
application to allow it to use enough memory to convert the large graphic
image.
<P>
To increase the memory partition, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Word.

<P><LI>Using the Finder, locate and click to select the Word application
   icon.

<P><LI>Press COMMAND+I to open the Microsoft Word Info dialog.

<P><LI>Increase the Preferred Size for Word by several thousand kilobytes (KB).

<P><LI>Repeat steps 1-4 until you can convert the graphic or you have assigned
   all available memory to Word.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You can check to see how much memory is available by selecting About
This Macintosh on the Apple menu while the Finder is active.
<P>
If you work with large graphics often, you may want to leave the memory
allocation set high. That decision should be made by considering the total
memory available on the computer and how many other applications are
normally run at the same time as Word.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
