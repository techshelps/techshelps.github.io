</PRE><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 
<P>
The MW0979 disk included with this Application Note contains Word
Speak, a plug-in module for Microsoft Word versions 5.0 and 5.1 for
the Macintosh that lets you use your Macintosh computer and the Apple
MacinTalkª II software to ''speak'' selections from a Microsoft Word
document. You select the text you want, then choose the voice you want
the computer to use. When you choose the Speak Selection command, the
computer speaks the text.
<P>
Word Speak runs on Macintosh AV computers, such as the Macintosh
Quadra(TM) 840AV and the Macintosh Centris(TM) 660AV, and any other
computer on which Apple's MacinTalk II or MacinTalkPro II software has
been installed.
<P>
MacinTalk II and MacinTalkPro II were created by Apple as part of its
development technology.  The MacinTalk II and MacinTalkPro II system
software is available through Apple development sources.
<P>
<P><h2>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</h2>
 
<P>
In addition to the Microsoft Word Speak Plug-in Module file, you must
have the following:

<UL><LI>System 6.0.7 or later.
<LI>Microsoft Word 5.0 or 5.1.
<LI>Apple Computer's MacinTalk II or MacinTalkPro II software installed
   in your System Folder.
<LI>MacinTalk II voices will run on any Macintosh computer with at
   least 150K of RAM available; MacinTalkPro II voices require a
   Macintosh LC II or above, with 700K to 2.75 MB of RAM available.
   (The RAM requirements vary for each voice.)
<P>
</UL><h2>INSTALLING THE MICROSOFT WORD SPEAK PLUG-IN MODULE</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Word.

<P><LI>Drag the Word Speak PIM icon into the Word Commands folder, which
   is usually located inside the Word folder.

<P><LI>Restart Word.
<P>
</OL>USING THE WORD SPEAK PLUG-IN MODULE
 
<P>
After you have installed the Word Speak plug-in module and started
Word, two new commands appear on the Tools menu: Speak Selection and
Pick Voice.
<P>
<P><h3>To tag a selection to be spoken with a particular voice</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select the text you want.

<P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose the Pick Voice command.

<P><LI>Choose a voice from the drop-down list.

<P><LI>Adjust the Rate, Pitch, and Modulation slider controls to change
   the characteristics of the voice. If you want to restore the
   original default settings of the voice, click the Reset button.

<P><LI>Click the Test button to try out the options you chose.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>Word Speak inserts a voice tag (represented by a small, nonprinting
icon) at the beginning of the selected text.
<P>
<P><h3>To have the computer speak a selection</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select the text. The selected text can include any number of voice
   tags.

<P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Speak Selection.
<P>
   NOTE: If no text is selected when you choose the Speak Selection
   command, the computer will speak the entire paragraph that contains
   the insertion point.
<P>
</OL>You can use several different voices in one sentence. Suppose, for
example, that you want the first two words of the sentence to be
spoken in one voice, and the remaining six words to be spoken in a
different voice. Select the first two words, use the Pick Voice
command to choose voice options, and then click OK. Then select the
last six words, use the Pick Voice command to choose new voice
options, and then click OK. To have the computer speak the sentence,
select the entire sentence, and choose Speak Selection from the Tools
menu. Word uses the voice specified in the first tag to speak the
first two words, then it loads the second voice and speaks the last
six words.
<P>
<PRE>  NOTE: Word Speak will not speak hidden text.

</PRE></OL><h3>To remove a voice tag</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Turn on the Show Hidden Text option if the voice tag is not
   visible. (To locate the Show Hidden Text option, choose Preferences
   from the Tools menu, and choose the View icon.)

<P><LI>Select the icon.

<P><LI>Press the DELETE key.
<P>
</OL>TROUBLESHOOTING
 
<P>
<P><h3>"Word Speak: Text-To-Speech not available."</h3>
 
<P>
This error message appears if you choose either the Speak Selection or
Pick Voice commands without having installed the Apple MacinTalk
software. See the ''System Requirements'' section for information
about obtaining this software. Make sure that you have restarted your
computer after installing this software.
<P>
<P><h3>"Word Speak: Not enough memory to complete the operation."</h3>
 
<P>
You have specified a voice that requires more memory than you have on
your computer. Try selecting a different voice. (The MacinTalkPro II
voices require more memory than the standard MacinTalk II voices.)
<P>
<P><h3>When I choose Speak Selection command, the voice loads but doesn't speak.</h3>
 
<P>
You may have selected only the icon representing the voice tag. Make
sure that you select the text itself, or position the insertion point
in the paragraph that you want the computer to speak before choosing
the Speak Selection command.
