The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes common Setup problems you may encounter when you
install Word for Windows. Use this article as a troubleshooting guide to
assist you in diagnosing and resolving these problems. In many cases, this
article refers you to another Microsoft Knowledge Base article that
addresses a particular Setup problem in greater detail.
<P>
This article contains the following four sections:

<UL><LI>General Troubleshooting

<LI>Setup Stops or Hangs Your Computer

<LI>Setup Error Messages

<LI>Cannot Start Word After Successfully Completing Setup
<P>
</UL><h2>GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING</h2>
 
<P>
You can resolve most Setup problems, regardless of their specific cause,
using these General Troubleshooting procedures. If you do not find
information about your particular Setup problem in the remaining sections
of this article or in other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles, use these
General Troubleshooting steps and then run Setup again.
<P>
IMPORTANT: If you modify your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file using any of
the troubleshooting steps below, be sure to restart (reboot) your computer
so the changes can take effect.

<OL><P><LI>Make sure your PATH statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file includes the
    location of your Windows program directory and your MS-DOS directory
    (or the location of SHARE.EXE), including the drive letter. If the PATH
    statement includes the Windows program directory without the drive (for
    example, "\WINDOWS" instead of "C:\WINDOWS"), Windows may set the
    WINDIR variable incorrectly. If your PATH statement does not include
    the directory where SHARE.EXE is located (usually the MS- DOS
    directory), Setup may be unable to locate the SHARE utility. In either
    case, Setup may fail.
<P>
    Correct PATH statement example:
<P>
       PATH C:\WINDOWS;C:\DOS
<P>
    Incorrect PATH statement example (drive letter missing):
<P>
      PATH \DOS;\WINDOWS
<P>
    Note: WINDIR is an environment variable set by Windows, based on the
    location of the WIN.COM file.

<P><LI>Start Windows with Program Manager as the shell instead of a third-
    party Windows shell application such as Norton Desktop for Windows
    (NDW.EXE) or Central Point PC Tools Desktop (WNDT.EXE). To use Windows
    Program Manager as the shell instead of a different application,
    modify the SHELL setting in the [Boot] section of your SYSTEM.INI
    file to the following:
<P>
      [Boot]
      SHELL=PROGMAN.EXE
<P>
   IMPORTANT: You must exit and restart Windows after you modify SYSTEM.INI
   so the change can take effect.

<P><LI>Replace any third-party extended and upper memory managers (such as
    QEMM) with the MS-DOS extended-memory manager (HIMEM.SYS) and upper
    memory manager (EMM386.EXE). In addition, make sure your EMM386.EXE
    settings are correct. For more information about EMM386.EXE, refer to
    your MS-DOS documentation.

<P><LI>Edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and remove or remark out (using the REM
    command) the SMARTDRV.EXE line.

<P><LI>Disable any virus-scanning software in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
    files. After you run Setup, you can re-enable the virus- scanning
    software.

<P><LI>Quit Windows and restart in standard mode (type "win /s" [without the
    quotation marks] at the MS-DOS prompt).

<P><LI>Remove any SUBST or ASSIGN commands from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If
    necessary, you can restore these commands after you run Word Setup.

<P><LI>If you are using a video driver supplied with your computer, switch to
    the Windows video driver for your video display type (such as VGA).

<P><LI>If you are running MS-DOS version 6.0 or later, and if you are not
    using a third-party memory manager (such as QEMM), run the MS-DOS
    MEMMAKER utility. Sometimes Setup runs correctly after running
    MEMMAKER, especially in cases where Setup has hung after you responded
    (either Yes or No) to the WordPerfect Help prompt. If you are running
    IBM PC-DOS, use the RAMSETUP utility instead; see your PC- DOS
    documentation for information about RAMSETUP.

<P><LI>Check the TEMP setting in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Make sure it points
    to a valid location on a drive with at least 6 to 8 MB available disk
    space. If the TEMP setting is invalid or missing, modify your
    AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<P><LI>Make sure the PATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or the SET PATH
    statement in your CONFIG.SYS file does not contain more than 128
    characters. The SHARERES.DLL file used by Word does not support a PATH
    statement longer than 128 characters.
<P>
    Note: You might have a PATH statement longer than 128 characters if you
    run Microsoft Windows NT version 3.1. If you are running MS-DOS version
    6.0 or 6.2, you can use a SET statement in your CONFIG.SYS file to set
    a PATH longer than 128 characters. Some third-party applications, such
    as NDOS, by Norton Utilities, or 4DOS, by JP Software, Inc., support
    longer PATH statements.

<P><LI>Check your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to make sure the location of SHARE.EXE is
    in your PATH statement. Setup needs to find SHARE in order to add it to
    your system configuration.

<P><LI>Verify that your Windows swap file is permanent instead of temporary.
    It may help to enlarge the swap file. Refer to your Windows
    documentation for more information about the Windows swap file.

<P><LI>Run the MS-DOS SCANDISK utility (MS-DOS version 6.2 and later only) to
    diagnose and repair any hard disk problems on the drive where you want
    to install Word. See your MS-DOS documentation for information about
    SCANDISK.

<P><LI>Run the MS-DOS DEFRAG utility (MS-DOS version 6.0 and later only) to
    reorganize the files on your hard disk and to optimize disk
    performance. See your MS-DOS documentation for information about
    DEFRAG.

<P><LI>If the computer has a Turbo mode, turn it off, either by resetting the
    switch and restarting the machine or resetting the CMOS switch.

<P><LI>Verify that the SYSTEM.DRV line is correct in the SYSTEM.INI. In the
</OL>[boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI the line should read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   [boot]
   system.drv=system.drv

</PRE></OL><h2>SETUP STOPS OR HANGS YOUR COMPUTER</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Symptom: During Complete/Custom Installation, Setup hangs after you
    select the Word components to install and choose the Continue button.
<P>
    -or-
<P>
    During Typical Installation, Setup hangs after you choose the Yes or No
    button in the dialog box that asks if you want to install WordPerfect
    Help.
<P>
    -or-
<P>
    During Laptop Installation, Setup hangs after you choose the LapTop
    Installation button.
<P>
   Resolution: Use General Troubleshooting steps in the preceding section.

<P><LI>Symptom: When you insert Disk 2 and press ENTER to continue, Setup
    hangs.
<P>
    Resolution: Add the MS-DOS DRIVPARM command to your CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
    If a physical drive is not reading a disk properly and the disk is not
    physically defective, the MS-DOS DRIVPARM command in the CONFIG.SYS
    file often corrects the problem. The DRIVPARM command modifies the
    parameters of an existing physical drive; it does not create a new
    logical drive. The settings specified in the DRIVPARM command override
    the driver definitions for any previous block device.
<P>
    Add the DRIVPARM command to your CONFIG.SYS file using the following
    syntax:
<P>
       DRIVPARM=/d:number /f:factor
<P>
    For more information about the DRIVPARM command, see your MS-DOS
    documentation.

<P><LI>Symptom: When you insert Disk 1 and press ENTER to continue, Setup
    hangs.
<P>
    Resolution: On some clone computers, the BIOS may be out of date. Check
    the date and revision number of the BIOS of your computer to ensure
    that it is current (BIOS information usually appears on the screen when
    you start your computer.

<P><LI>Symptom: Setup hangs after you respond (either Yes or No) to
    the WordPerfect Help prompt.
<P>
    Resolution: Use General Troubleshooting steps in the preceding section.
<P>
</OL><h2>SETUP ERROR MESSAGES</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Symptom: Setup may display one of the following types of error message:
<P>
    Setup has encountered a problem. Please report
    file = 'WORD60A', line = 'NN' to Microsoft Product
    Support Services.
<P>
    -or-
<P>
    &lt;Type of Error&gt; Object ID &lt;####&gt;: &lt;Description&gt;
<P>
    Note: In these error messages, &lt;Type of Error&gt; describes the general
    nature of the problem (such as "Setup Parse Error" or "Setup Error in
    Finalize Pass"); &lt;####&gt; is the number of a line in the SETUP.STF file;
    and &lt;Description&gt; describes precisely which process failed.
<P>
    Resolution: Query on the error message in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
    and follow any instructions you find for the specific error message. If
    your error message is undocumented in the Microsoft Knowledge Base, use
    the "General Troubleshooting" steps above in this article.
<P>
    For additional assistance in resolving these Setup error messages,
    query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
       cryptic and

<P><LI>Symptom: WWINTL.DLL file error messages.
<P>
    Workaround 1: If you participated in prerelease testing of Word 6.0,
    you may have a prereleased (Beta) version of Word on your system. If
    so, remove this version and install the retail version.
<P>
    Workaround 2: If you used the Word 6.0a Patch disk to upgrade your
    installation of Word 6.0 to Word 6.0a and a "wrong WWINTL.DLL" error
    occurs when you try to start Word, you may have a bad Word 6.0a Patch
    disk. This problem does not occur when you run the patch that you
    downloaded from an online service such as MSDL. It only happens when
    you run the patch from a disk sent to you by Microsoft.  To get Word
    6.0 running again, you must run the Word Setup program and remove the
    Microsoft Word component. Then run Setup a second time and reinstall
    the Microsoft Word component. For detailed instructions, query on the
    following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
       bad and word and 6.0a and patch and disk and wwintl.dll
<P>
    If you received a bad Word 6.0a Patch disk, Microsoft is sending you a
    replacement disk. You don't need to do anything further to obtain this
    corrected patch disk.

<P><LI>Symptom: Compliance Checking error messages. If you purchased an
    upgrade to Word 6.0, Setup requests verification of your eligibility to
    upgrade and may prompt you to insert one of the disks from a previous
    version of Word or another eligible word processing application. This
    process, known as "compliance checking," confirms that you are using
    Word 6.0 in compliance with applicable copyright laws.
<P>
    Resolution: The U.S. (domestic) edition of Word 6.0 uses lenient
    compliance checking, which means that, even if you do not provide the
    appropriate disk, Setup installs Word. You can either insert the
    requested disk or choose the Continue button to finish installing Word.
    Some international, localized versions of Word use strict compliance
    checking, which means that Setup does not install Word until you
    provide verification of your eligibility to upgrade.

<P><LI>Symptom: The following error message appears at the end of Word Setup:
<PRE>        Cannot modify SETUP.STF

    Workaround: This error message does not prevent Setup from successfully
    installing Word. Choose the OK button to close this error message.

</PRE><P><LI>Symptom: The following error message appears during Setup:
<P>
       Setup detected older foreign language proofing tools that are
       incompatible with Microsoft Word 6.0.  To upgrade these
       tools, please call Microsoft Customer Service or your
       local subsidiary.  Choose Cancel to Exit Setup.
<P>
    Workaround: Remove these foreign language proofing tool files, from
    Word 2.x, then rerun Word 6.0 Setup.

<P><LI>Symptom: Memory or disk space errors during Word or Office Setup.
<P>
    Workaround: Ensure you have sufficient disk space on the drive
    where Setup is writing temporary files. Setup writes temporary
    files to the last available drive letter (for example, if you
    have drives C:, D:, H:, and K:, Setup writes temporary files
    to K:).
<P>
    NOTE: Some of these error messages incorrectly refer to low memory
    instead of insufficient disk space.
<P>
</OL><h2>CANNOT START WORD AFTER SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING SETUP</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>If Word 2.x is installed on your system, rename your Word 2.x
    WINWORD.INI and NORMAL.DOT files to rule out the possibility that these
    files are affecting Word 6.0.

<P><LI>Switch to a different Windows printer driver using the Printers icon in
    Windows Control Panel. This rules out the possibility that your printer
    driver is affecting Word 6.0.

<P><LI>If general protection (GP) faults or "Out of Memory" error messages
    occur after you start Word 6.0, check the FILES and BUFFERS settings in
    your CONFIG.SYS file. Set FILES=60 in your CONFIG.SYS file unless you
    have a software application that requires a higher setting. Set
    BUFFERS=10 in your CONFIG.SYS file if you use SMARTDRV.EXE. Using a
    high number of buffers with SMARTDRV will decrease efficiency. If you
    are not using SMARTDRV, set BUFFERS=30. More buffers may improve disk
    access times but will use more conventional memory. See your MS-DOS
    documentation for more information on the correct FILES and BUFFERS
    settings for your computer.

<P><LI>If "Segment Load Failure" errors occur when you run Word, even after
    you uninstall and reinstall the Word Program component, delete the
    following files and then reinstall Word to rule out the possibility
    that any of these required component files is corrupted or damaged:
<P>
       COMPOBJ.DLL
       OLE2.DLL
       OLE2.REG
       OLE2CONV.DLL
       OLE2DISP.DLL
       OLE2NLS.DLL
       OLE2PROX.DLL
       SDM.DLL
       STORAGE.DLL
       WWINTL.DLL
       WINWORD.EXE
