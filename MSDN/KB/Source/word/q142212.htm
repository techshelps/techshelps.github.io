The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Names on the Address Book MRU (Most Recently Used) list may be incorrect or
missing, and may insert incorrect information into your document when
selected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you use the TAB key to move through the fields on
the Business tab when creating a new "Microsoft Mail" or "Other" address in
the Exchange Personal Address Book.
<P>
Tabbing through the fields deletes the entry in the "First" field and
inserts only the last name into the document. If you delete this entry from
the Address Book and then click on the same incorrect name in the MRU, the
previously missing data from the "First" field is inserted into the
document. Although the incorrect entries can be deleted from the Address
Book, the only way to delete the incorrect names from the MRU list is to
edit the registry.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Avoiding Incorrect Entries</h3>
 
<P>
To avoid incorrect entries in the Address Book MRU and avoid insertion of
"phantom" names in a Word document:

<UL><LI>When entering the "First" and "Last" names on the Business tab, do not
   use the TAB key to move to the Address field. Use your mouse to move the
   insertion point into the field.

<LI>Verify the location of the "First" name before clicking OK, or retype
   the "First" name. Once it has been physically added to the Business tab,
   it behaves normally.
<P>
</UL><h3>Removing Incorrect Entries</h3>
 
<P>
To remove incorrect entries from the Address Book MRU list, edit the
registry.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
Locate the following Registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0\Data

</PRE>Make a backup copy of the key by exporting it, and then delete the key.
<P>
Quit Regedit start Word. The Address MRU will be cleared of entries.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem does not occur when working with Schedule+; it occurs only in
the Personal Address Book from Exchange.
