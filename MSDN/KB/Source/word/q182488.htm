The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to create side-by-side paragraphs. You can use
the side-by-side paragraph feature to create multiple columns of uneven
widths and lengths, place text beside graphics, or overlay text and
graphics.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Word 98 Macintosh Edition, side-by-side paragraphs are different from
newspaper, or snaking, columns. When you use newspaper columns (snaking
columns), the text fills one column and continues at the top of the next
column (see method 2 below if this is your intention). When you are using
side-by-side paragraphs, paragraphs are matched side-by-side to show
relationships. You specify which paragraphs belong beside each other by
applying the appropriate indents and side-by-side formatting to each set of
paragraphs.
<P>
The following is an example of side-by-side paragraphs:
<P>
<PRE>   PAMPHLET -
                         Ross Manufacturing Company
                           Preferred Customer Plan

   Featuring                          Your Benefits

   Bulk-volume discounts, with        Price savings (40-60%) with built-
   rebates based on annual volumes    in rebates. You pay less per item
   (at wholesale prices).             when you order more.

   Custom-designed fittings for       Unique fittings for your customers
   corrosive and high-pressure        within two weeks after we receive
   fluids.                            the order; a maintenance contract
                                      is included.

</PRE><h3>Method 1: Use Word Tables</h3>
 
<P>
Use tables in Word to create side-by-side paragraphs as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Position the insertion point where you want to create the columns of
   side-by-side paragraphs.

<P><LI>On the Table menu, click Insert Table.

<P><LI>Enter the Number Of Columns and Number Of Rows you want to create.
   NOTE: You can later add or subtract more columns and rows as needed.

<P><LI>Click OK to return to the document.

<P><LI>Type the information that is to appear in side-by-side paragraphs
   in the appropriate table cells, pressing the TAB key to move to the next
   cell. The information that is entered in these cells automatically
   wraps to the next line when it reaches the right-cell boundary.
<P>
</OL>For more information about creating side-by-side columns with tables, click
Contents And Index on the Help menu (or on the Balloon Help menu if you are
using a version of the Macintosh operating system earlier than 8.0), click
the Index button in Word Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   side-by-side columns, tables

</PRE></OL>and then click Show Topics. Select the topic you want, and click Go To. If
you are unable to find the information you need, ask the Office Assistant.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Use Linked Text Boxes</h3>
 
<P>
Use linked text boxes to flow text in parallel, or side-by-side paragraphs
from page to page. By using linked text boxes, you can have text from
column 1 flow to column 1 on the next page. The text beside it in column 2
can flow to column 2 on the next page, parallel to column 1.
<P>
To use linked text boxes to create side-by-side columns, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Preferences.

<P><LI>Click the View tab and click to select the Paragraph Marks (under
    Nonprinting Characters). Or, click the Show/Hide button on the
    Formatting toolbar.

<P><LI>Click at the top of the page where you want the side-by-side columns
    to start, and press RETURN twice.

<P><LI>Click the first paragraph mark on the page.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Text Box.

<P><LI>Click and drag where you want the first column on the page.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Text Box.

<P><LI>Click and drag where you want the second column on the page.

<P><LI>Click the last paragraph mark on the page, and press
    COMMAND+SHIFT+RETURN to create a page break.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 1-9 for each page that will contain side-by-side
    columns in your document.

<P><LI>Click to select the first text box you created.

<P><LI>In the Text Box toolbar, click the Create Text Box Link button.

<P><LI>Click the text box on the left side of the second page to create
    a link.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 12-13 for all other text boxes that will contain this same
    "story." Note, a "story" is defined as text that's contained within a
    single text box, or a chain of linked text boxes.

<P><LI>Repeat the entire process for every text box in the next story.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Pressing RETURN twice at the top of each page creates an extra empty
paragraph. This empty paragraph is useful if you want to insert text or
graphics outside of the text boxes. You can delete the empty paragraph if
you don't need it.
<P>
For more information about creating side-by-side columns with linked text
boxes, click Contents And Index on the Help menu (or on the Balloon Help
menu if you are using a version of the Macintosh operating system earlier
than 8.0), click the Index button in Word Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   side-by-side columns, linked text boxes

</PRE></OL>and then click Show Topics. Select the "Keep columns side by side from one
page to the next" topic, and click Go To. If you are unable to find the
information you need, ask the Office Assistant.
