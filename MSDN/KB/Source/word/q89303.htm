The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you create a multiple-column Microsoft Word for Windows document
and apply border formatting to the left and right sides of the
paragraphs, the borders may overlap between the columns. This problem
occurs if the value of the Space Between Columns setting is zero (0)
inches. In page layout view, the overlapping borders are not
displayed. In print preview, the overlapping borders are displayed as
they appear when printed.
<P>
This article describes a method for adding a left border to the
left-most column, a right border to the right-most column, and a
single line between each column on a page.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following method is a modification of the instructions for
creating a page border on page 367 of the "Microsoft Word for Windows
User's Guide." This method allows you to edit your document without
affecting the placement of borders.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround for Word 6.0</h3>
 
1. From the Format menu, choose Columns. Select the Number Of Columns
<PRE>   and enter a number in the Space Between box like .25. Select the Line
   between checkbox, then choose the OK button.

</PRE><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Page Setup. Choose the Margins dialog tab.
   Type a minus sign before the measurement in the Top box.
<P>
   Note: If your document already contains a header, type a minus sign
   before the measurement in the Bottom box, rather than the Top box.

<P><LI>In the Header box under From Edge, type the same measurement as the
   top margin. (For example, if the top margin is 1 inch, the Header
   From Edge setting should be 1 inch as well).
<P>
   Note: If your document already contains a header, set the Footer
   measurement under From Edge equal to the bottom margin. Choose the OK
   button.

<P><LI>From the View menu, select Header and Footer (switch to Footer if the
   document already contains a header), and choose the OK button. Select
   the paragraph mark in the header pane. From the Format menu, choose
   Paragraph. In the Line Spacing box, select Exactly. In the At box,
   type the distance between the top and bottom margins. To calculate
   the  At value, subtract the top and bottom margin from the vertical
   page height. (For example, if you have an 8.5-inch-by-11-inch page in
   portrait view with 1-inch top and bottom margins, type 9" in the At
   box). Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Borders and Shading. In the Border box,
   select the left and right sides of the sample paragraph. In the Line
   box, select a border style, and choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL><h3>Workaround for Word 2.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Columns. Select a value in the Number
   Of Columns and the Space Between boxes. Select the Line Between check
   box, then choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Page Setup. Select the Margins option
   button, type a minus sign before the measurement in the Top box, and
   choose the OK button.
<P>
   Note: If your document already contains a header, type a minus sign
   before the measurement in the Bottom box, rather than the Top box.

<P><LI>From the View menu, choose Normal. From the View menu, choose
   Header/Footer. In the Header box under From Edge, type the same
   measurement as the top margin. (For example, if the top margin is 1
   inch, the Header From Edge setting should be 1 inch as well).
<P>
   Note: If your document already contains a header, set the Footer
   measurement under From Edge equal to the bottom margin.

<P><LI>In the Header/Footer box, select Header (select Footer if the
   document already contains a header), and choose the OK button. Select
   the paragraph mark in the header pane. From the Format menu, choose
   Paragraph. In the Line Spacing box, select Exactly. In the At box,
   type the distance between the top and bottom margins. To calculate
   the At value, subtract the top and bottom margin from the vertical
   page height. (For example, if you have an 8.5-inch-by-11-inch
   page in portrait view with 1-inch top and bottom margins, type 9" in
   the At box). Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Border. In the Border box, select the
   left and right sides of the sample paragraph. In the Line box, select
   a border style, and choose the OK button.
