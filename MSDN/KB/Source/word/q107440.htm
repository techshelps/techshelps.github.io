The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Word for Windows pictures that are in the text layer may not display
or print if the Drawing Objects option is cleared. (To locate the
Drawing Objects option, choose Options from the Tools menu, and select
the Print tab.)
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Drawing Objects option is designed to allow or inhibit printing of
drawing objects that are in the drawing layer. However, there is a
problem in Word that causes picture objects in the text layer to not
display or print if they are edited when this option is cleared.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word for
Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Word 6.0, "pictures" and "drawing objects" are two different
things. Word pictures or picture objects are graphics/drawings that
are rendered in the text layers of the document. Drawing objects are
graphics/drawings that are rendered in the drawing layers of the
document.
<P>
Word pictures are created in one of three ways:

<OL><P><LI>By inserting a piece of clip art and then double-clicking it to make
   changes.

<P><LI>By choosing Microsoft Word 6.0 Picture from the Insert Object
   dialog box.

<P><LI>By creating a drawing object in the drawing layer, selecting it,
   and choosing the Create Picture button on the drawing toolbar.
<P>
</OL>The Drawing Objects option in the Print tab of the Options dialog box
was meant to inhibit printing of drawing objects only. The fact that
it affects the rendering and printing of Word pictures is a problem in
Word.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Options. Select the Print tab.

<P><LI>In the Include With Document box, select Drawing Objects. Choose
   OK.

<P><LI>For each object that does not display or print, double-click it to
   activate it. When it displays in a Picture editing window, select
   something in the drawing by clicking and then choose Close Picture.
   Now the object will display and print.

<P><LI>If you do not want the drawing objects to print, when you are ready
   to print, go back to the Print tab and clear the Drawing Objects
   option. Do not activate or modify any pictures while this option is
   selected.
