<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In order to open a Word 97 document in an earlier version of Word (6.x
and 7.x), you must use a converter. For more information about what
happens when you use the converter, see the "Contents of the Wrd97cnv.doc
Readme File" section of this article.
<P>
The most recent version of the converter (Wrd97cnv.exe) is available in the
ValuPack folder included with the Office 97 SR-1 Enterprise Update (the CD
version of SR-1).
<P>
The converter is also available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:
<P>
<PRE> ~ <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/Wrd97cnv.exe">Wrd97cnv.exe</A> <I>(size: 984958 bytes)</I> 

   This file includes a Setup program that installs either
   Msword8.cnv or Mswrd832.cnv on your computer (depending on the version
   of Windows you are running). The Setup program also installs the
   Wrd97cnv.doc Readme document.

   NOTE: Msword8.cnv is the converter for Word 6.0 for Windows.
   Mswrd832.cnv is the converter for Word 7.0 for Windows 95.

<P><h3>Contents of the Wrd97cnv.doc Readme File</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Word 97 converter converts documents from Microsoft Word 97
format to Word 95, and Word 6.x for Windows or Windows NT.
<P>
For Network Install of Word 97 converter:

<OL><P><LI>Type "source:\wrd97cnv.exe /A" (without quotation marks) and press
   ENTER, where "Source" is the directory containing Wrd97cnv.exe.
<P>
   NOTE: All the files are extracted into the source directory.

<P><LI>Each Workstation will then need to run Setup.exe from the network
   server location.
<P>
</OL>Because not all Word 97 features are supported in earlier versions, Word
95 or Word 6.x users may lose data or formatting when they open Word 97
documents. The following tables describe data or formatting that may not
be converted correctly.
