The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to rename or delete a file in the Open dialog box (on the File
menu, click Open) and you are viewing files in preview mode, you receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot rename [or delete] '&lt;file name&gt;'. Access is denied. Make sure
   the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not
   currently in use.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when the file you are trying to rename or delete does not
contain a preview picture. Because this picture is absent, Word must open
the file so that you can scroll through it in the Open dialog box. When the
file is open, Word cannot display the properties.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Before you attempt to rename or delete a file, change the view from Preview
to any other view (such as List, Details, or Properties) by clicking the
appropriate button in the Open dialog box.
<P>
NOTE: You may have to close and then reopen the Open dialog box before you
can rename or delete a file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Preview picture allows a snapshot of the first page of the document to
appear in the Open dialog box. You can save a preview picture of the
document by clicking Properties on the File menu and clicking the Save
Preview Picture check box to select it (the check box is in the lower-right
corner of the Summary tab).
