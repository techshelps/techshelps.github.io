The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you click the File menu to view the most recently used (MRU) list,
there may be a file listed that resembles the following:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\...\~$CovSht@13-03-97,10-01-03.tmp

</PRE>Note: The numbers in the file name will differ from the example. The
numbers are actually the date and time the file was created.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This file was created and left on the system by the Fax Wizard.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow these steps to reset the MRU list:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the General tab.

<P><LI>Clear the "Recently Used File List" check box, and click OK.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the General tab.

<P><LI>Click to select the Recently Used File List check box and click OK.
<P>

   TITLE     : WD97: How to Reset Word 97 MRU Lists

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Fax Wizard helps you create a cover sheet and fax a document to
someone. You can use the Fax Wizard to send a fax, to mail merge to a fax,
or to print a cover sheet to send from a fax machine.
<P>
In the Fax Wizard, there is an opportunity to enter the recipients names
and their fax numbers. The Fax Wizard creates a Word document with a table
containing these names and numbers for use during the fax process. Each
time the Fax Wizard is run, a new file is created. Each of these files are
approximately 20 kilobytes (KB) in size. Once the process is complete, Word
does not remove these files from your computer or reuse the information
from the file in the Fax Wizard.
<P>
There is no way to prevent the Fax Wizard from creating these files, or to
have the Fax Wizard delete the file when it has finished. You will have to
manually search for and delete these files from your computer.
<P>
Note: Deleting these files will not remove them from the MRU list.
<P>
The documents are named similar to other temporary files created by Windows
programs and are stored in the Temp folder. The Temp folder in Windows 95
is usually C:\Windows\Temp, but may be different on your computer.
<P>
You may want to check the Autoexec.bat file, if one exists, for the
location of the Temp folder. You may want to delete these files from your
computer periodically by using the following steps:
<P>
To Remove Temporary Files
<P>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit all Windows programs.

<P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Find, and then click "Files or Folders".

<P><LI>Click the Name &amp; Location tab.

<P><LI>In the Named: box, type "~*.*" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Make sure the Look in: box displays the correct drive (for example,
   your hard disk drive - usually Drive C:), and the Include subfolders
   check box is selected. Click Find Now.

<P><LI>If any files are found, do the following:
<P>
   a. On the Edit menu, click Select All.
<P>
   b. On the File menu, click Delete.
