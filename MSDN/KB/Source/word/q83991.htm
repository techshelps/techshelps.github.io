The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install version 5.0 of Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, two
sets of system resources may be added to the System file on the active
Startup disk to allow the Word 5.0 Equation Editor and Voice
Annotation tools to operate properly.
<P>
Both sets of system resources will be installed if:

<UL><LI>You choose the Install button in the Easy Install dialog box.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You choose the Customize button and select any of the System
   Resources options in the Customize dialog box.
<P>
</UL>Only one set of system resources will be installed if:

<UL><LI>You choose the Customize button and select the Equation Editor With
   System Resources option (only the Equation Editor resources will be
   installed).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You choose the Customize button and select any Voice Annotation
   options other than Voice Annotation Only (only the Voice Annotation
   resources will be installed).
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The two sets of system resources that may be added to your Macintosh
System file are defined as follows:
<P>
<P><h3>Equation Editor System Resources</h3>
 
<P>
These resources include the file types FOND and NFNT for the MT Extra
font (used in the Equation Editor). Also, during installation, a
downloadable font file called MTExt is placed in the System Folder.
(In System 7.0, MTExt is placed in the Extensions folder.) This font
appears on the Word font menus as MT Extra.
<P>
Note: Most equations use the standard Symbol font, not the MT Extra
font. The Equation Editor can produce 42 special characters, such as
horizontal braces, diagonal ellipses, and custom arrows. To see the
entire character set for the MT Extra font:

<OL><P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Symbol.

<P><LI>From the Font list in the Symbol dialog box, choose MT Extra.
<P>
</OL><h3>Voice Annotation System Resources</h3>
 
<P>
Sound resources of file type snth are added for the Voice Annotation
package and are for use with System versions earlier than 6.0.6 and
for the Macintosh Portable (NOT the PowerBook). These resources are
licensed from Apple and are installed in System versions later than
6.0.6.
<P>
In addition, a file called Voice Record which has a file type of cdev,
is installed in the System Folder. This file is a voice annotation
file created by Articulate Systems, Inc.
<P>
Note: The Voice Record file is used in place of Articulate System's
retail version of Voice Record (a Control Panel program). The Word
version of Voice Record patches the Voice Annotation software to your
Macintosh Sound Control Panel. The retail version of Voice Record
allows full editing of sounds within the Voice Annotation Plug-in
Module (PIM) within Word 5.0. The retail version of Voice Record is
available from Articulate Systems, Inc. For more information, call
Articulate Systems, Inc., at (800) 443-7077.
