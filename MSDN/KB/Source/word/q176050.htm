The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides troubleshooting procedures you can use to identify,
recover, or prevent corruption of Microsoft Word for the Macintosh
documents.
<P>
Corrupted document files can cause any program to exhibit unusual behavior.
Such behavior occurs because the program attempts to make decisions about
what to do next based on incorrect information in the corrupted document.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Identifying a Corrupted Document</h3>
 
<P>
Corrupted documents often exhibit behavior that is not part of the
program's design (for example, infinite repagination, incorrect document
layout and formatting, unreadable characters on the screen, error messages
during processing, system hangs or crashes when you load or view the file,
or any other unusual behavior that cannot be attributed to the normal
operation of the program). These behaviors can be caused by factors other
than document corruption. To rule out other factors, use the following
troubleshooting steps:

<UL><LI>Check for similar behavior in other documents.

<LI>Check for similar behavior in other programs.

<LI>Take the file in question to another computer and attempt to duplicate
   the behavior.

<LI>Use a different printer driver and attempt to duplicate the behavior.

<LI>Rename any templates attached to the document and attempt to duplicate
   the behavior.

<LI>Start the computer again with extensions off to disable any third-party
   programs that are running (such as terminate-and-stay-resident programs
   [TSRs], font managers, and screen savers), and then attempt to duplicate
   the behavior.
<P>
</UL>If the problem occurs only with a single document after performing these
steps, your document is probably corrupted.
<P>
<P><h2>CORRECTING A CORRUPTED DOCUMENT</h2>
 
<P>
There are several techniques you can use to try to correct a corrupted
document. Which method you use depends on the nature and severity of the
corruption and the nature of the behavior exhibited. Although many of these
methods succeed regularly, not every corrupted document can be recovered.
Keeping a backup copy of a document is the best way to ensure its recovery.
<P>
<P><h3>Convert the File to Another Format</h3>
 
<P>
Convert the file to another format, and then convert it back to its native
format.
<P>
This is the easiest and most complete document recovery method; always try
it first. Save the file in Rich Text Format (RTF) file format; this format
preserves the formatting in your Microsoft Word for the Macintosh document.
After you save the file in RTF format, reopen the document in Word, and
convert it from RTF. If this method succeeds, the file corruption is
removed during conversion.
<P>
To save the file as RTF, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As.

<P><LI>In the Save File As Type area, select Rich Text Format
<P>
</OL>If the corruption persists after you save the file in RTF file format, try
saving the file in the following file formats:
<P>
<PRE>   Other word processing formats
   Text Only

</PRE></OL>NOTE: Saving a file in Text Only format frequently corrects the document
corruption problem; however, all document formatting is lost including
graphics and field codes in Word 98 Macintosh Edition. This method requires
more reformatting; therefore, use it only after other file formats fail to
correct the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the AutoRecover Feature in Word</h3>
 
<P>
The AutoRecover feature in Word will attempt to automatically recover text
from a document that was open when Word stopped responding. When you
restart Word after it stops responding (hangs), a dialog box will be
displayed with the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Word encountered file corruption while opening &lt;FILE NAME&gt;. Part of this
   document may be recoverable. Attempt Recovery Now?

</PRE>NOTE: This recovery may take some time depending on the size of the
document and the amount of corruption in the document.
<P>
After the document has been recovered, immediately use the Save As command
on the File menu to save the document with a new file name. This will
insure that the original document will be available for other recovery
attempts. This automatic recovery method strips all formatting, graphics,
and objects from the document. Other methods, listed below, may allow you
to recover more of your original formatting and so on from the damaged
document.
<P>
For more information about the AutoRecover feature, see the "Prevent loss
of Word and Recover Lost Documents" topic in Word Help.
<P>
<P><h3>Open the Damaged Word Document in Draft Mode</h3>
 
<P>
Open the damaged Word document in draft mode. Sometimes (not always, due to
the nature of damaged documents) you can open a document successfully in
draft mode when it will not open in other views. Once you open the file,
you may be able to recover or repair the file.
<P>
To switch to draft mode in Word, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Normal.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Preferences

<P><LI>Click the View tab

<P><LI>Click to select the Draft Font option.
<P>
</OL><h3>Copy Everything Except the Last Paragraph Mark to a New Document</h3>
 
<P>
Word associates a wide variety of formatting with the last paragraph mark,
especially section and style formatting. If you copy everything except the
last paragraph mark to a new document, the corruption may be left behind in
the original document. In the new document, reapply the section or style
formatting.
<P>
NOTE: You can select everything except the last paragraph mark by pressing
COMMAND+END, and then COMMAND+SHIFT+HOME.
<P>
<P><h3>Copy the Uncorrupted Portions of the Document to a New Document</h3>
 
<P>
Sometimes you can determine the location of file corruption in your
document. In this case, copy everything except the corrupted portion to a
new file, and follow these steps to reconstruct your document:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the uncorrupted portions of your document and paste them into a new
   file (you may not want to select the final paragraph mark of this
   selection because that paragraph mark may hold some incorrect
   information).

<P><LI>Save a copy of the corrupted document in Text-Only format.

<P><LI>Open the Text-Only file.

<P><LI>Copy the text from this file and paste it into the file that contains
   the uncorrupted portion of your document.

<P><LI>Reformat the sections of the document you pasted in step 4, and then
   save the recovered document.
<P>
</OL><h3>Insert the File into a Blank Document</h3>
 
<P>
If you cannot open a file to copy all text except the final paragraph mark,
you may be able to insert the file into a new document (which will give a
new final paragraph mark to the file you are correcting). To do this,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a New Document based on the Normal template.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click File. Select the corrupted document and Click
   OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Open The File Using Recover Text From Any File</h3>
 
<P>
As a last resort, this special converter can be used to manually open
corrupt documents. Using this converter removes all formatting, graphics,
and embedded objects from the file. It strips everything from the file
except readable text (ASCII characters). Because of the way Word document
files are organized and saved, the text may be disjointed and or
duplicated. With even the simplest files there will be lots of reformatting
required. With smaller files it is often desirable to open a new second
document and copy and paste text from the recovered document to the new
document because there is so much unwanted text recovered.
<P>
To use the "Recover Text From Any File" converter to open a document:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu click open.

<P><LI>On the "List files of Type" drop down list and select "Recover Text
   from Any File".

<P><LI>Navigate to the folder that holds the corrupt file and select it.

<P><LI>Click open.
<P>
   NOTE: The recovery process may take some time depending on the size
   of the document and the type of corruption. As soon as the recovery
   is complete, on the file menu click open and change "List Files Of
   Type" back to Word Documents or Readable Files.
<P>
   TIP: Save the recovered file with a new name at this point, this
   will keep you from accidentally overwriting the original document,
   and insure that the original document will still be available for
   other recovery attempts.
