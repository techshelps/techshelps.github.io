The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a Microsoft Word for the Macintosh version 5.0 file is opened
into Microsoft Word version 4.0, the PICTs that were created as
Objects get larger. This includes Insert Object equations created with
the Word 5.0 Equation Editor and Paste Special Paste Linked Pictures.
<P>
The actual equation or graphic will remain the same size as it was in
Word 5.0, but the picture area that contains the graphic is increased
vertically. Currently, there is not a workaround to retain the
original PICT size.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The picture box changes size as a result of the hidden information
that Word 5.0 uses for storing the link information. Since Word 4.0
does not use this information, it adjusts the size of the picture box,
trying to allow for the hidden information to be contained within the
picture.
<P>
The Word 4.0 Update Link command under the Edit menu will be available
when the linked PICTs from Word 5.0 are opened. However, the link is
not available since Word 4.0 uses Quickswitch and the PICTs were
linked with OLE in Word 5.0.
<P>
