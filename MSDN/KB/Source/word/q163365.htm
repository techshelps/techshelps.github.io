The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you perform a certain sequence of specific steps involving cutting,
pasting, undoing, and dragging an object back and forth from another
program into Word, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

   WinWord has caused an invalid page fault in module MSO97.DLL

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The error is specific to the order in which the editing steps are
performed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This error is caused by a rare occurrence of very specific steps.
<P>
In general these errors only occur if one or more objects and some text are
selected, then a cut, and then followed by an undo command prior to some
other object movement operations. This should not cause an ongoing problem
because the second time this is tried, the undo command will not be
required, as the incorrect items will not have been selected prior to the
cut.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for
Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
