<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains general information on linking and embedding
objects in Microsoft Word for Windows documents.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Client and Server Applications</h3>
 
<P>
A client is an application whose documents can accept linked or
embedded objects. A server is an application that creates objects that
can be  linked and embedded into other documents.
<P>
When you double-click (activate) an embedded object in a client
document, the server application for the object is invoked, unless it
is  already running, and a new document window is opened for editing
the  object. When you double-click a linked object, the server
application  for the object is invoked, unless it is already running,
and the source  document is opened in a new window. If you activate an
object and the  server application is already running but does not
support multiple  document windows, a new instance of the server
application is invoked.
<P>
<P><h3>Embedded or Linked Objects</h3>
 
<P>
A compound document is one that contains one or more linked or embedded
objects. An object is any data that can be displayed in a compound
document and can be manipulated by the user. Once inserted, an object
maintains an association with the application that created it. Objects
are data with "behavior." For example, a graphical image is simply data;
however, if the graphical image can be activated (that is, given
behavior) to allow editing in another application (a server), it is
considered an object.
<P>
There are two types of objects: linked objects and embedded objects.
These types behave differently. The data of an embedded object is
completely contained within the client document. Embedded objects
consist of three components: an OwnerLink (data that identifies the
object by its server name), a Presentation (data used to display and
print the object), and Native Data (data that defines the object in the
format that the server application understands).
<P>
A linked object contains a reference (or link) to data shared by a
server application and a client. A linked object consists of two
components: an ObjectLink (data that identifies the object by its
server  name and specifies the native data source) and a Presentation
(data used  to display and print the object). Native Data, which
defines a linked  object, is stored in a source file to which the
object is linked.
<P>
An embedded object increases the client file size more than a linked
object because the embedded object contains its native data.
<P>
Note: Do not confuse linking an object with linking to a file, as with
the Insert Picture command. In the Picture dialog box, if you select the
Link To File check box, Word inserts an IMPORT field in the document.
The IMPORT field reads the graphics-format file and displays a bitmap as
its result. If you double-click a picture (or any static graphic)
inserted by the IMPORT field, Word makes the picture a Microsoft Draw
embedded object and opens Draw so that you can edit it. Any link to an
original source file is lost.
<P>
Actions you can perform on an object are called verbs. The verbs an
object uses depends on the nature of the object. For example, a sound
object has a primary verb "play" and a secondary verb "edit." When you
double-click the object, the primary verb action is activated. Play and
edit are two common object verbs. Many objects support one verb only.
<P>
<P><h3>Inserting Objects</h3>
 
<P>
To insert an embedded object in a Word document, choose Object from the
Insert menu and select the type of object desired. This launches an
instance of the selected server application if necessary and opens a new
document window in the server. The document title bar reads "Object in
&lt;filename&gt;" indicating that you are editing an object. You may also
launch the server application independently of Word, select the desired
data and copy it to the Clipboard, then choose Paste from the Edit menu
in Word.
<P>
Note: Generally, the Edit Paste command embeds the object that is on the
Clipboard. Under some circumstances, however, (for example, with a
Microsoft Excel worksheet), Word may not embed the object but merely
insert a static copy of the data.
<P>
When you embed an object, Word creates an EMBED field. The switch \s
enables you to scale the embedded object to the size you want by
dragging the sizing handles.
<P>
To insert a linked object into a Word document, launch the server
application independently, open a source document, select the desired
data, copy it to the Clipboard, and then choose Paste Special from the
Edit menu in Word. Select the desired data format and choose Paste Link.
If Paste Special is unavailable, the source application is probably not
an OLE server.
<P>
In a LINK field, you can automatically insert any of the following
switches, depending on which format you select in the Paste Special
dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   Switch     Result
   -------    -------------------------------------------------

   \a         The link updates automatically.
   \t         Inserts the linked object as unformatted text.
   \r         Inserts the linked object as RTF text.
   \p         Inserts the linked object as a picture.
   \b         Inserts the linked object as a bitmap.

</PRE><h3>Editing Objects</h3>
 
<P>
If the object is displayed as a graphic image, the easiest way to edit
it is to double-click the image. This opens the object in the server
application and allow manipulation of the data. Double-clicking
activates (or runs) the primary verb for the object. You can also select
(single- click ) the object and choose "&lt;source name&gt; object" from the
Edit menu. If your linked object is displayed as text or is an object
whose primary verb is not edit, or if you have the EMBED or LINK field
codes are displayed, select the object or field code and then choose
"&lt;source name&gt; object" from the Edit menu.
<P>
If you need to modify or repair the nature of a link, choose Links from
the Edit menu. All current links are displayed in and are modified from
this dialog box.
<P>
In general, if you paste a linked object as RTF text, it first displays
with the same formatting as in the source application. If you change the
text formatting of the object in Word and then reformat the source, the
Word formatting prevails because of the "\* mergeformat" switch in the
LINK field. The actual data in the object changes to reflect the source.
<P>
In general, if you paste a linked object as unformatted text, it first
appears formatted with your Word default font. If you change the
formatting of the object in Word and then reformat the source, the Word
formatting prevails because of the "\* mergeformat" switch in the LINK
field. The actual data in the object changes to reflect the source.
<P>
In general, if you paste a linked object as a picture or bitmap, it
appears exactly as it does in the source document. Changes to the
formatting of the source document display in Word. The format of this
object cannot be modified in Word, but the object can be sized and
scaled by dragging the object's sizing handles.
