The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-cd, 2.0b, 2.0c,
   6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Word, the maximum number of characters that can be entered into a
FILLIN field prompt is 255.
<P>
To achieve the effect of more than 255 characters in a FILLIN field you 
can:

<UL><LI>Use two FILLIN fields next to each other.

<LI>Use blank fields and F11 to move among them.

<LI>Use a WordBasic InputBox macro.
<P>
</UL>The "More Information" section of this article discusses three methods you 
can use to do this.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Place multiple FILLIN fields next to each other</h3>
 
<P>
You can place multiple FILLIN fields next to each other. When you reach the
maximum number of characters for the field, choose the OK button and
continue the text in the next dialog box.

<OL><P><LI>Create a new document by clicking New on the File menu.

<P><LI>Press CTRL+F9 (COMMAND+F9 in Word for the Macintosh) to enter the field 
   code braces {}.

<P><LI>Inside the braces, type "Fillin" (without the quotation marks) and the
   prompt text--for example, "Type until you can't type anymore, and then
   click OK." Your field should look resemble the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {Fillin "Type until you can't type anymore, and then click OK."}
</PRE>
<P><LI>Move the insertion point outside the braces and press the SPACEBAR.

<P><LI>Repeat step 2 to 3 but change the prompt text to "Please continue
   typing." This field should look like:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {Fillin "Please continue typing."}
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select both FILLIN fields and press F9 to update the fields. A dialog
   box appears prompting you to enter text for the first FILLIN field.
   Type "Now is the time for all" (without the quotation marks). Choose OK.

<P><LI>The next FILLIN dialog box will appear. Type in "good men to come to
   the aid of the party" (without the quotation marks). Click OK.

<P><LI>Toggle Field Codes view so that you see the result instead of the field
   codes. In Word 2.x you can click Field Codes on the View menu. In
   Word 6.x and later you can click Options on the Tools menu and click to 
   clear the Field Codes check box on the View tab.
<P>
<P><PRE>      The result should appear resemble the following:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Use Blank Fields and F11 to Navigate Through Them</h3>
 
<P>
To use blank fields and F11 to navigate through them, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click New, and click OK.

<P><LI>Type the following information, pressing ENTER several times after each
   entry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Name:
      Address:
      Phone Number:
</PRE>
<P><LI>Press CTRL+F9 (COMMAND+F9 in Word for the Macintosh) to create a set of 
   field code braces for each entry. Your document should appear as
   follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Name:  {}
      Address:  {}
      Phone Number:  {}
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: These braces are hidden unless you have the Field Codes option
      turned on. For more information about viewing field codes, see the 
      "Show or Hide Field Codes" topic in Word Help.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      As long as the braces do not contain any spaces or characters,
      they do not generate any error messages.
</PRE>
<P><LI>With the field code braces positioned after each question, you can use
   the F11 key to move quickly to each set of field braces. The SHIFT+F11
   key combination moves your insertion point to the previous set of field
   braces.
<P>
   This method allows you to enter as much information as you want for each
   prompt. The field braces are replaced by the text that you enter.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 3: Use the WordBasic/Visual Basic for Applications InputBox$ Command</h3>

</PRE></OL>The InputBox$ command displays a dialog box requesting a single item of
data and returns the text entered in the dialog box when you choose the OK
button.
<P>
The InputBox$() command in the following macro examples assigns the text
you enter to a variable. The insertion point is moved to a user-defined
bookmark before inserting the contents of the variable.
<P>
The syntax is as follows
<PRE>   
   a$ = InputBox$(Prompt$ [,Title$] [,Default$])
   
</PRE>where:
<PRE>   
   Prompt$ is the text displayed in the dialog box.
   
   Title$ is the title displayed in the title bar of the dialog box; if
   omitted, Word uses the title "Microsoft Word".
   
   Default$ is the default text proposed in the text box of the dialog      
   box.
   
   Sub MAIN
      ' Display Inputbox.
      MyText$ = InputBox$("Type text")
      ' Goto pre-defined bookmark.
      EditGoTo "bookmark"
      ' Insert text entered throught the Inputbox command.
      Insert MyText$
   End Sub
