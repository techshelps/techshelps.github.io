The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you upgrade from Word 5.x to Word 6.0 or Word 98, you may still need
to save your documents in Word 5.x format.
<P>
By using the converters supplied with Word for the Macintosh, you can save
Word documents in other file formats and preserve as much formatting as the
other program can support. To save a file in another file format, including
Word 4.x or 5.x for the Macintosh or Word 2.x for Windows format, use the
Save As command. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>From Word 6.0 or Word 98, click Save As on the File menu.

<P><LI>Select a file format in the Save File As Type box, type a name for the
   file, and click Save.
<P>
</OL>If the file format you need does not appear in the Save File As Type box,
the converter is not installed. To install additional converters, run Word
Setup again. If you have installed all the converters that come with Word
and you still don't see the one you need, you may need to obtain a
supplemental converter. For more information, see the " Getting Information
About Supplemental Converters" section of this article.
<P>
Word recognizes the file formats of many common word-processing,
spreadsheet, database, and page-layout programs. If you need to transfer
documents between Word and programs for which specific converters aren't
available, you can also import and export documents in plain-text formats.
Plain-text formats retain the text of a document without most of the
formatting. These formats are also useful for transferring documents when
using electronic mail systems.
