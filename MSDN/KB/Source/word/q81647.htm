The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Word versions 6.0 and 6.0a, if you apply an inside border to a
paragraph, and then select the paragraph mark following and apply a bottom
border, the formatting applied to the first paragraph disappears. The
border for the first paragraph does not display in print preview and will
not print. This problem also occurs if you apply a left or right border to
the following paragraph.
<P>
In Word versions 2.x, a paragraph will not display a border formatted as
Below using the Border command if the following paragraph is also formatted
with a border Below. This behavior also occurs for paragraphs with borders
formatted as Above.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Word Version 6.x</h3>
 
<P>
To apply paragraph formatting to the second paragraph without losing the
formatting of the first paragraph, do not select the paragraph mark of the
second paragraph. Instead, position the insertion point anywhere in the
second paragraph and select the Border button.
<P>
<P><h3>To place a border between two paragraphs in Word versions 2.x</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select the paragraphs you want to place a line between and choose
   Borders And Shading (Border in Word 2.0) from the Format menu.

<P><LI>In the Border box, choose the line between the paragraphs in the
   sample. If you are using the keyboard, press ALT+R, then press the
   RIGHT ARROW key four times (twice in Word 2.0).

<P><LI>In the Line box, select a line style other than None. Choose the OK
   button.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Word Versions 6.0 and 6.0a</h3>
 
<P>
New paragraph formatting is applied to the subsequent paragraph when adding
the bottom border. The initial paragraph no longer has an inside border,
and therefore does not display or print an inside border. This is because
an inside border can only exist between two or more paragraphs that contain
the formatting.
<P>
To demonstrate, reproduce the problem symptoms described above and then
move the insertion point to the first paragraph and press ENTER. After
pressing ENTER, an inside border appears between paragraphs 1 and 2, and
paragraph 2 does not have a bottom border (because it wasn’t formatted to
have a bottom border).
<P>
To view the border formatting, place your insertion point in the first
paragraph, select Format, select the Borders Tab and view the sample
border. Repeat this step for the paragraph with the bottom border applied.
Notice that the border formatting is different for these paragraphs.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Versions 2.x</h3>
 
<P>
The Format Border command facilitates placing borders around multiple
paragraphs as well as placing border lines between paragraphs.
<P>
NOTE: Word versions 1.x for Windows do not support placing borders
around multiple paragraphs, only single paragraphs. Consequently, a
paragraph with a border formatted as Below or Above will always
display since it is formatted independently of the paragraphs around it.
