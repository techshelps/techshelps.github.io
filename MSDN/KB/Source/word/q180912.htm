The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition, the color of the Previous Page and
Next Page buttons on the vertical scroll bar change to blue, and the
ToolTips change to Previous Find/GoTo and Next Find/GoTo.
<P>
Also, when you press these buttons or their shortcut keys (COMMAND+PAGE UP
or COMMAND+PAGE DOWN), the insertion point either remains in the same
place, goes to an incorrect location, or Word displays the following
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Word has reached the &lt;beginning or end&gt; of the document. Do you want to
   continue searching at the &lt;beginning or end&gt;?

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Previous Page and Next Page buttons are black by default. When a
different browse object type is selected, other than Browse by Page, the
buttons turn blue to indicate that the Previous and Next buttons have been
reassigned. The ToolTips for these buttons also indicate the current button
assignments.
<P>
For example, the prompt to "continue searching" indicates that a search is
active, and the buttons have been reassigned to Previous Find/GoTo and Next
Find/GoTo.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use any of the following methods to reset the Previous and Next buttons to
Previous Page and Next Page.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Reset the Select Browse Object to Browse By Page</h3>
 
<P>
Click the Select Browse Object button (located between the Next and
Previous buttons on the scroll bar), and then click the Browse By Page icon
(far right, top row).
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Record Resetting the Select Browse Object to Browse By Page</h3>
 
<P>
To record the action of resetting the Browse Object to Browse By Page,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and click Record New Macro.

<P><LI>Enter a name for the macro in the Macro name text box and click OK.

<P><LI>Click the Select Browse Object button (located between the Next and
   Previous buttons on the scroll bar), and then click the Browse By
   Page icon (far right, top row).

<P><LI>On the Tools menu point to Macro and click Stop Recording.
<P>
</OL>You can then assign this macro to a toolbar or menu item.
<P>
For more information about how to assign a macro to a toolbar,
click the Office Assistant, type "How do I assign a macro" (without the
quotation marks), click Search, click the "Add a button to a toolbar"
topic, and then click to view "Add a button to a toolbar."

</PRE>You will need to create two macros (BrowseNext and BrowsePrev) that will
automatically reset the Browse Object buttons when you click them. Use the
following procedure to create the macros.
<P>
NOTE: Once these macros have been created with the names BrowseNext and
BrowsePrev the COMMAND+PAGE UP, COMMAND+PAGE DOWN keys and the browse
buttons on the vertical scrollbar will ALWAYS browse by page.
<P>
To create the BrowseNext macro, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new Word 98 document.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

<P><LI>Under Macro Name, type "BrowseNext" (without the quotation marks).
   In the Macros In box, click to select "All active templates and
   Documents," and then click Create.
<P>
   NOTE: This macro has to be called BrowseNext so that it will function
   When you click the Next Page button.

<P><LI>Change the existing BrowseNext macro to the following:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub BrowseNext()
      '
      ' BrowseNext Macro
      ' Jump to the next browse object.
      '
         Application.Browser.Target=wdBrowsePage
         Application.Browser.Next
   
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>On the File menu, click Save Normal.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Close and Return to Microsoft Word.
<P>
</OL>To create the BrowsePrev macro, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>With your new Word 98 document still open, on the Tools menu, point to
   Macro, and then click Macros.

<P><LI>Under Macro Name type "BrowsePrev" (without the quotation marks).
   In the Macros In box, click to select "All active templates and
   Documents," and then click Create.
<P>
   NOTE: This macro has to be called BrowsePrev so that it will function
   when you click the Previous Page button.

<P><LI>Change the existing BrowsePrev macro to the following:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub BrowsePrev()
      '
      ' BrowsePrev Macro
      ' Jump to the previous browse object
      '
         Application.Browser.Target=wdBrowsePage
         Application.Browser.Previous
   
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>On the File menu, click Save Normal.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Close and Return to Microsoft Word.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Browse Buttons</h3>
 
<P>
The Select Browse Object button (located between the Next and Previous
buttons on the scrollbar) enables you to select a number of additional
object types. Word may assign one of the following properties to the Next
and Previous buttons after you attempt to go to any of these objects:
<P>
<PRE>   GoTo
   Find
   Edits
   Heading
   Graphic
   Table
   Field
   Endnote
   Footnote
   Comment
   Section
   Page

</PRE></OL>For example, if you attempt to go to a comment, the buttons change to
Previous Comment and Next Comment. Another example would be when you click
Find on the Edit menu. Once you click Find to find an item, the Select
Browse Object buttons will be set to Next or Previous Find/GoTo.
<P>
<P><h3>COMMAND+PAGE UP and COMMAND+PAGE DOWN</h3>
 
<P>
Typically, when you press the COMMAND+PAGE DOWN or COMMAND+PAGE UP shortcut
keys, Word will place the insertion point at the top of the next or
previous page. However, when another browse object is selected using the
Select Browse Object button, these keys browse to the next object in the
appropriate direction.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about the Select Browse Object buttons, click the
Office Assistant, type "What is select browse object?" (without the
quotation marks), click Search, click the "Move around in a document"
topic, and then click to view "Scroll through a document by using the
mouse."
<P>

Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer,
