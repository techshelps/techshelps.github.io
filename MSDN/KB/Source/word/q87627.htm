The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are running Microsoft Word for Windows in Microsoft Windows
operating system version 3.1 and you are using the IQ Engineering font
cartridges, you may experience problems with incorrect screen font or
printer font substitution. Also, the cartridge name may not be
displayed in the Print Setup dialog box.
<P>
This article provides information about the IQ Engineering font
cartridges and troubleshooting information for the above problems.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Problems and Workarounds</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>The IQ Super Cartridges are not always listed as installed
   cartridges in the Print Setup dialog box. This problem occurs if the
   cartridge is not selected or if it is incorrectly installed. Use the
   installation instructions at the end of this article to reinstall and
   select the cartridge. Also, delete the WINWORD.INI file, which is
   located in the Word for Windows program directory.

<P><LI>Incorrect screen fonts may be used for some IQ Super Cartridge
   fonts. This problem occurs because the Super Cartridges do not
   provide matching screen fonts for their printer fonts. If you are
   using Super Cartridge 1 or 2, which contain bitmapped fonts, Word
   for Windows uses the closest matching screen fonts currently
   installed in Windows. As a result, the screen display of these
   fonts is not always "what you see is what you get."
<P>
   If you are using Super Cartridge 3, which contains scalable PCL-5
   fonts, and you have Hewlett-Packard (HP) Intellifonts or Adobe Type
   Manager version 2.0 or higher, matching screen fonts are available
   from IQ Engineering.

<P><LI>The IQ Cooper Black Super Cartridge font is sometimes substituted
   for internal printer fonts when the point size is above 24 points and
   the text extends to two pages or more. IQ Engineering is researching
   this problem. To print with the internal printer font instead of the
   IQ Cooper Black font, cut one-page selections of your document and
   paste them into a new document for printing as a series of one-page
   documents.
<P>
</OL><h3>Information About Super Cartridges</h3>
