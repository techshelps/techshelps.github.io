</PRE><h2>PERFORMANCE ISSUES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Long Boot Time for Word</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.0.1 loads faster than Word 6.0 by a range of 10-50 percent. The
exact difference depends on the machine and the number of fonts installed.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Launches Slowly with Many PS Type 1 Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
Changes to way the fonts are handled have improved boot time on systems
with these fonts loaded.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 6.0 Crashes on Launch If It Encounters a Bad Font</h3>
 
<P>
The improvements in font handling mean Word will no longer crash on start-
up if a bad font is in the system.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Count Speed Is Significantly Slower in 6.0 Than 5.1</h3>
 
<P>
Performance is now par with 5.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Doesn't Keep Up With Typing On Low-End Machines</h3>
 
<P>
Fast typists could lose keystrokes when typing on older machines. Users can
no longer "out-type" Word.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Table of Contents Takes Longer Than Expected in Word 6.0</h3>
 
<P>
Decreased the time it takes by making some changes to repagination.
<P>
<P><h3>View Menu Takes Longer to Drop Than Other Menus</h3>
 
<P>
The extra time was used drawing the bullet symbol. We now preload the
bullet.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>EXTENSIONS ISSUES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>No WYSIWYG for Font Drop-Down and Now Menus</h3>
 
<P>
Now WYSIWYG Menus from Now Software does not work as expected in Word 6.0.
With Word's Font MRU (Most Recently Used) option turned on, which is on by
default, WYSIWYG Menus is not able to display the font names in their
typeface in the font list. The workaround is to turn off Word's Font MRU
option, allowing WYSIWYG to display the font names in the appropriate
typeface. Word 6.0.1 recognizes if Now WYSIWYG Menus is installed and
automatically turns off the MRU list.
<P>
<P><h3>Adobe Type Reunion Is Off by 1 with the MS LineDraw Font Installed</h3>
 
<P>
The font drop-down menu does not display the correct font. It displays the
font above the correct font. The MS LineDraw font was corrupt. It's been
replaced.
<P>
<P><h3>Wrong Font Substituted with SuperATM</h3>
 
<P>
Rather than substituting with the appropriate font, Word 6.0 substitutes
with the default font. This is a problem in ATM. It's fixed in the new
3.8.2 version of ATM. Word also put in a workaround for earlier versions of
ATM.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Crashes with Super Boomerang Installed</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 crashes when you save a document and Super Boomerang is installed
on the system.
<P>
<P><h3>MacComCenter (QuickLink II) Doesn't Work with Word</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 fails to print to MacComCenter fax driver.
<P>
<P><h3>Delrina FaxPro for Mac Control Panel Doesn't Work with Word 6.0</h3>
 
<P>
When using the NoChooser Control Panel that ships with Delrina's FaxPro for
Macintosh, Word prints the file to the screen instead of to the fax driver.
<P>
<P><h3>Cursor Flashes During ATM Font Substitution</h3>
 
<P>
Pointer oscillates between an I-beam (or Arrow) and Watch cursor when
SuperATM is installed.
<P>
<P><h3>SAM Intercept Alert When Saving Word 6.0 Document</h3>
 
<P>
In Word 6.0, SAM Intercept throws up a "Suspicious Activity Alert" when
saving a document with Fast Save disabled.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Crashes with Mobius Nubus Card Manipulating Ruler</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 may crash when you click on the ruler or manipulate the toolbar
buttons on a computer that has a Mobius Nubus card.
<P>
<P><h3>Super Boomerang Causes a "False Crash" with Insert Picture</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 appears to hang (though it does not actually hang) when you use
Preview in the Insert Picture dialog box.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>PRINTING ISSUES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>ImageWriter: Faster Quality Is Disabled After Printing with Best Quality</h3>
 
<P>
When you print using Best Quality mode, and then try to change the quality
mode, Faster Quality is not available.
<P>
<P><h3>ImageWriter: Best Quality Prints as Faster Quality</h3>
 
<P>
Best Quality and Faster Quality printing modes produce the same output.
Printouts look the same when printed with either selection. Word 6.0.1 now
shows a definite difference in the two qualities.
<P>
<P><h3>Previewing Certain Documents Causes Word to Hang Under QuickDraw GX</h3>
 
<P>
A file that was saved under a QuickDraw GX and a non-QuickDraw GX
environment (causing both GX and non-GX print records in the document)
could cause Print Preview to hang. This has been fixed in 6.0.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Shading and OLE Objects Don't Print to QuickDraw GX Printers</h3>
 
<P>
When you print from Word to a QuickDraw printer or Portable Digital
Document printer from a Macintosh running QuickDraw GX, paragraph shading,
table shading, and OLE objects do not appear on the printout.
<P>
<P><h3>Envelopes Print Wrong Orientation to HP DeskWriter 520, 540c, 560c Printer</h3>
 
<P>
Envelopes print in portrait orientation after you choose landscape
orientation.
<P>
<P><h3>Can't Print Envelopes from the Multi-Purpose Tray with 7.x Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
Paper is pulled from the paper cassette rather than the envelope pulling
from the multi-purpose tray. This is fixed in 6.0.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 6.0 Doesn't Print Copies of Envelopes Correctly</h3>
 
<P>
When printing from the Envelope dialog box, Word 6.0 will only print one
copy of the envelope even if you selected multiple copies in the print
dialog box. Word can now print multiple copies of an envelope.
<P>
<P><h3>Envelopes Print Incorrectly from Color StyleWriter Pro</h3>
 
<P>
The envelope is inserted as Portrait, but the envelope prints as Landscape.
Word now sets the feed method correctly for this printer.
<P>
<P><h3>Only One Graphic Prints If First 6 Characters of Graphic Names Are the Same</h3>
 
<P>
Only one graphic prints and print previews because Word looks only at the
first six letters of the filename.
<P>
<P><h3>Lines Truncated Printing Envelopes from Dialog on LaserWriter Select 300</h3>
 
<P>
The Return and Destination addresses overlap, causing lines to be truncated
on the LaserWriter Select (or Personal LaserWriter) 300.
<P>
<P><h3>Return Address Missing When Printing Envelopes to Hewlett-Packard IIIsi</h3>
 
<P>
Envelopes printed from Tools/Envelopes to the HP LaserJet 3si or 4si MX to
the manual feed tray are truncated. The printer assumes that it's a letter-
sized page and prints the return address off the edge of the envelope. The
workaround for this problem is described in the Read Me file that ships
with Word 6.0.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Invalid "Outside of Printable Region" Error with LaserWriter 600/630</h3>
 
<P>
The first time you print an envelope in the Word session to the LW600/630
with the envelope feeder, Word gives a false error message: "The margins of
Section 1 are set outside the printable area of the page. Do you want to
continue?" This only occurs the first time in the Word session that the
Envelope tool is used. This is fixed in 6.0.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Changing Draft Font Requires Changing System Font</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 defaults to the Chicago font for draft viewing. Word 6.0.1
defaults to the Monaco font. Version 6.0.1 also allows you to change the
default draft font. To change the default font:

<OL><P><LI>Run the ToolsAdvancedSettings macro.
</OL>2. Select Microsoft Word as the category.
3. Type "DraftFont" (without the quotation marks) in the Option box.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: There is no space in "DraftFont".

</PRE><P><LI>Type the desired font name in the Setting box.
</OL>5. Choose Set. Choose OK.
6. Restart Word.
<P>
To use the Draft Font for viewing, you must be in normal view and then turn
on Draft Font in Tools/Options/View.
<P>
<P><h3>Dotted Tab Leader Clipped with Fractional Widths to a PostScript Printer</h3>
 
<P>
Dotted leader tabs don't print the full tab width in 6.0. They print
correctly in 6.0.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Uppercase Accents Are Shaved Off in Tables</h3>
 
<P>
Uppercase letters with accents lose the accent when they appear in a
table. In Word 6.0.1, fonts that are greater than 12 points work fine,
though problems may still occur with smaller fonts.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>5.1 TRANSITION ISSUES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Linefeeds Saved As Text with Line Breaks</h3>
 
<P>
When saving as Text With Line Breaks, Word inserts unwanted linefeeds at
the location of section breaks. Text Only With Line Breaks now acts just
like Word 5.1 for the Macintosh, and no linefeeds are inserted.
<P>
<P><h3>COMMAND+OPTION+PLUS SIGN Cursor Doesn't Work</h3>
 
<P>
There are two problems that have been fixed relating to the COMMAND+
OPTION+PLUS SIGN function. Inside dialog boxes, while in COMMAND+
OPTION+PLUS SIGN mode, moving the mouse causes the cursor to change back to
an arrow pointer. Also, the menu does not flash to indicate that a command
was just added to that specific menu. Both of these problems are fixed in
6.0.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Error Using Word 5.1 Merge File with Conditional That Begins with a Number</h3>
 
<P>
Word 5.1 print merge documents that have a conditional with a value
containing a number cause an error when converted and used in Word 6.0.
Word now handles this case.
<P>
<P><h3>When Merging Word 5.1 Settings, Some Key Commands Are Incorrect</h3>
 
<P>
The keypad directional keys and SHIFT+RETURN (Insert Linebreak) keystrokes
were not mapped correctly when merging the Word 5.1 setting files into Word
6.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 5.1 File Won't Print in Word 6.0</h3>
 
<P>
A class of Word 5.1 documents that have bad page numbers will not print in
Word 6.0. Some of these files seem to have been created in another
application with a file converter. They print correctly in 6.0.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 5.x Range Index Entries Are Lost When Opened into 6.0</h3>
 
<P>
When a Word 5.x document containing one or more range index entries that
span two or more pages is opened into Word 6.0 and updated, only the first
page of the original index entry range appears in the updated index. This
is fixed in 6.0.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Can't Open 5.1 Documents That Contain Corrupt Information</h3>
 
<P>
6.0.1 now works around this and opens the files despite the corruption.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 5.1 Document with Math Formulas Converts the Closing Parenthesis Wrong</h3>
 
<P>
The right field bracket is placed inside the closing parenthesis of the
expression, rather than outside the closing parenthesis, so Word 6.0
gives an error for the expression.
<P>
<P><h3>Font ID Number Displayed Instead of the Font Name for Some Word 5.X Files</h3>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by corrupt font information in the file. Word 6.0.1
works around this.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 5.x Mail Merge Header Document Ignored on Import</h3>
 
<P>
When using a Mail Merge document from Word 5.x, a separate header file will
be ignored and the field entries from the first data record in the data
document are substituted as field names. This is fixed in 6.0.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Page Number Setting Not Converted from Word 5 Format</h3>
 
<P>
The "start at" page number is lost when opening Word 5.x documents. This
is now converted correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 5.1 Consecutive TOC and Index Entries Don't Convert Properly</h3>
 
<P>
When an ".i." code and a ".c." appear next to each other, the one that
precedes the other makes the following entry disappear. Word now converts
5.1 index entries correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>Not All Shortcut Keys Are Shown for Corresponding Commands on the Menus</h3>
 
<P>
Word now displays more shortcut keys on the menus.
<P>
<P><h3>Added a Word 5.1 Keystroke Macro</h3>
 
<P>
This macro remaps shortcut keys to Word 5.1 shortcuts. The macro is
available in the 5.1 Upgrade Template found in the Macros folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Copying Large Blocks of Text from Word 6 and Pasting to Word 5.1 Fails</h3>
 
<P>
When you copy text from Word 6.0 and try to paste it in Word 5.1, you may
not be able to select the paste option or use COMMAND+V, or the text may
paste without formatting. This is now fixed in 6.0.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Other Applications Cannot Open Word 6.0 Files Saved as Word 5.1 Files</h3>
 
<P>
Saving a file as a Word 5.1 document left the file with a W6BN file type,
which is used by Word 6.0 documents. The file now gets a WDBN file type,
which is used by Word 4.0 and 5.x, so other applications can recognize the
file type.
<P>
<P><h3>Num Lock Is Off by Default</h3>
 
<P>
Num Lock is now on by default, as it was in Word 5.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Index Bookmark Should Include Entry</h3>
 
<P>
If a range entry ends right after a page break, the range entry is lost. In
Word 6.0.1, the range entry is retained.
<P>
<P><h3>Hang/Crash: These 5.1 Docs Hang or Crash Word</h3>
 
<P>
The problem happened with files that were created by another application
with a converter. We now work around the bad information in the file.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>GENERAL ISSUES</h2>
 
<P>
No Message Displayed If File Already in Use by Macintosh User over a
Network
 
<P>
The OLE libraries were updated to fix this problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Error Message When Choosing Certain Printing Option in the Award Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
A bookmark in the Wizard is missing. This causes problems for users who
choose the "Does your paper have a pre-printed border on it?" option. This
problem is fixed in 6.0.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Applying New Page Format to One Section Applies It to All Sections</h3>
 
<P>
Section start formatting is now applied to the correct section.
<P>
<P><h3>Legal Pleading Wizard Halts After 2+ Runs with a Word Basic Error 9</h3>
 
<P>
In low memory conditions, values for a list box were lost. We now handle
this case using the last values if the current ones aren't available.
<P>
<P><h3>Document Repaginates Incorrectly When a Document Font Is Missing</h3>
 
<P>
Word now repaginates even if a font in a document is no longer on the
machine it was opened on.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Crashes When Adding an AutoText Entry to the Envelope Tab</h3>
 
<P>
Word crashes if you type a space after the name of the AutoText entry
before pressing COMMAND+OPTION+V in the Envelope tab. Word 6.0.1 now
inserts the entry if there is no space, or displays an error message.
<P>
<P><h3>Can't Open PowerTalk Letters by Dropping Them onto Word</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.0.1 has an added "lttr" file type that Word understands.
<P>
<P><h3>Can't Open AOCE Attachment Sent Via PowerTalk and StarNine QuickMail</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 generates an error and is unable to open AOCE mail attachments
that have been sent through Apple's PowerTalk and the Star*Nine QuickMail
gateway. This problem is fixed in 6.0.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Apple Menu Doesn't Say for Macintosh or Power Macintosh</h3>
 
<P>
If you choose "About Microsoft Word" from the Apple menu, the text now
tells whether Word for the Macintosh or Word the Power Macintosh is
running.
<P>
<P><h3>Word's Startup Splash Screen Should Display Macintosh or Power Macintosh</h3>
 
<P>
The Word splash screen now tells users whether they are running the version
of Word for the Macintosh or the Power Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h3>Routing Problem Across Mail Connection Gateway</h3>
 
<P>
The routing problem was corrected in 6.0.1 by no longer storing the
resolved user name.
<P>
<P><h3>Can't Enter "!" on Swiss German Keyboard</h3>
 
<P>
This problem was corrected in 6.0.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Field Brings Up Word Help Contents Rather Than Context Sensitive Help</h3>
 
<P>
When you press the HELP key while your insertion point is in certain
fields, the Help Contents screen is displayed instead of context-specific
Help.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Regenerating Paragraph Heights And Page Table Information</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.0.1 keeps information about paragraph heights and page layout in
memory longer. This speeds up Word in some scenarios.
<P>
<P><h3>Get Info Version Doesn't Have "6.0.1"</h3>
 
<P>
Get Info now shows the new version number.
<P>
<P><h3>Award Wizard Preview Art Not Updating with "Back" Command</h3>
 
<P>
An AutoText entry is missing in the Award Wizard. This was corrected in
6.0.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Display "Command+." Instead of "Escape" in Messages</h3>
 
<P>
"Command+." has replaced "Escape" in the Word's message strings. Both
"Command+." and "Escape" work to cancel the action.
