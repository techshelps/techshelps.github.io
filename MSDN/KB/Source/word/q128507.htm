The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Assistant, version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Internet Assistant, you may receive the following error
message when you start any Office program:
<P>
<PRE>   Call to undefined dynalink

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible causes of this error:
<P>
Cause 1: Microsoft Office Manager was active during installation.
<P>
<PRE>         If this is the case, you also will receive a message during setup
         that COMPOBJ.DLL and STORAGE.DLL were in use and could not be
         written. As a result, two of the .DLL files, COMPOBJ.DLL and
         STORAGE.DLL, are not updated during setup. Because these two files
         will have earlier dates than the other OLE version 2.0 files,
         other products that use the same files are affected and will give
         error messages.

</PRE>Cause 2: Another program may have installed its own versions of the OLE 2.0
<PRE>         files.

         These files may be incompatible with Internet Assistant or Office
         applications. The OLE version 2.0 files are

            OLE2CONV.DLL
            OLE2DISP.DLL
            OLE2NLS.DLL
            COMPOBJ.DLL
            STORAGE.DLL

         and are located in the Windows\System folder.

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Method 1: If Microsoft Office Manager was active during installation, turn
<PRE>          off Microsoft Office Manager and reinstall Internet    Assistant
          for Word.

</PRE>Method 2: If Another program may have installed its own versions of the OLE
<PRE>          2.0 files, use the following steps:

          a. Exit from all OLE 2.0 applications (such as any of the
             products listed at the beginning of this article).

          b. Rename the following files from the Windows\System folder
             (give the files the name "&lt;filename&gt;.XLL"):

               OLE2CONV.DLL
               OLE2DISP.DLL
               OLE2NLS.DLL
               COMPOBJ.DLL
               STORAGE.DLL

          c. Use the appropriate Setup icon (Maintenance Mode), to
             reinstall any of the products named at the beginning of this
             article. This will recopy the appropriate files to the
             Windows\System subdirectory.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Programs that may install other versions of the .DLL files described in
Cause 2 include:
<P>
<PRE>   Announcements 4.0 by Parsons Technology
   Claris Works version 3.0
   CorelDraw
   InternetWorks Lite by BookLink Technologies
   Maplinks 3.0h
   Micro Cook Book v5.0 by PinPoint Publishing

</PRE>BookLink Technologies also distributes full versions of InternetWorks. Some
beta versions of InternetWorks may write over the OLE 2.0 files.
