<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 6.0.1,
   6.0.1a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Word, you may not be able to save files opened from a Dayna
NetMounter volume to the original location regardless of your
read/write privileges. The file opens as if you have read privileges
but not write privileges, or as if the document is locked. No message
is displayed that the file is read-only or locked.
<P>
This problem has been confirmed by Dayna Communications. It has been
corrected in NetMounter version 4.0.
<P>
NetMounter 4.0 is available directly from Dayna Communications (as a
maintenance release) and is also available in the DOS Mounter Plus
retail package.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

NetWare servers with or without the Novell Mac services (VAPs) loaded.
