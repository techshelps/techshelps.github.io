<P>
<P><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 
<P>
This Application Note describes a general procedure for printing
envelopes on the Apple(R) StyleWriter(R), StyleWriter II, LaserWriter(R),
LaserWriter Plus, LaserWriter IISC, Personal LaserWriter SC, Personal
LaserWriter LS, Personal LaserWriter NT, Personal LaserWriter NTR,
Personal LaserWriter IIF, Personal LaserWriter IIG, LaserWriter IINT,
LaserWriter IINTX, LaserWriter Pro, and the Hewlett-Packard(R) (HP(R))
DeskWriter(TM).
<P>
If your PostScript(R) printer is not listed above, follow the instructions
for either right- or center-feed printers. If you're not using the Apple
LaserWriter driver and your printer driver supports printing envelopes,
select that option and choose the OK button. Then from the File menu,
choose Print Preview (or Page Preview in versions 3.x) and make sure the
orientation is set to Landscape (in 3.x, Wide).
<P>
Depending on the font and printer you are using, you may need to change
the margin settings as well as add or delete carriage returns for the
desired address placement when printing a return address.
<P>
The disk included with this Application Note contains template documents
created using the specified settings listed below. To use one of these
documents:

<OL><P><LI>From the enclosed MW0164 disk, select the template document from the
   disk that corresponds to the printer selected in the Chooser.
<P>
   NOTE: The filename designations "w/ RA" and "w/o RA" mean "with
   return address" and "without return address," respectively.

<P><LI>Change the text within the document to reflect the information to be
   printed on your envelope.
<P>
</OL>Note to users of the LaserWriter driver versions 6.0 and later: The Number
10 Envelope option in the Page Setup dialog box does not work with these
settings. We recommend that you use the settings below for the best output.
If the printer being printed to supports the Larger Print Area option, the
top and left margins for printing an envelope with a return address can be
reduced to approximately 0.25 inch. To set this option:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Page Setup. In 3.x, hold down the SHIFT key
   while you choose Page Setup.

<P><LI>Choose the Options button and select Larger Print Area.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button twice to exit the dialog boxes.
<P>
</OL>Note to all Word versions 3.0, 3.01, and 3.02 users: Please note the
following differences between Word versions 3.x and versions 4.0 and
later:

<UL><LI>In Word 3.x, margins are not changed by choosing Document from the
   Format menu but are changed by choosing Page Setup from the File menu.

<LI>In Word 3.x, the page orientation option is not an icon (Portrait or
   Landscape) but rather an option button called Tall or Wide.
<P>
</UL>Note to all Word versions 5.0 and 5.1 users: Please refer to pages
103-108 and 640-641 in the "Microsoft Word User's Guide" for extensive
information about printing envelopes in Word.
<P>
<P><h2>PRINTING ENVELOPES ON RIGHT-FEED PRINTERS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Printing Envelopes on the LaserWriter or LaserWriter Plus</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: The disk included with this Application Note contains documents
created using the specified settings listed below.

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Page Setup, set the orientation to Landscape
   (in 3.x, Wide), and select US Letter for the paper size.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Document (in 3.x, choose Page Setup from
   the File menu).
<P>
   To print an envelope without a return address, set the margins as
   follows, and go to step 3:
<P>
<PRE>      Top:  2.5   Left:    4.5
      Bottom:  0.5   Right:   2.0

   To print an envelope with a return address:

    a. Set the margins as follows:

         Top:    0.5 Left:    0.5
         Bottom:  0.5   Right:   2.0

    b. Type the return address.

    c. Press return enough times to create 12 paragraphs (lines), including

<P><LI>Feed the envelope through the manual-feed slot of the LaserWriter, with
   the top edge of the envelope against the right edge of the manual-feed
   slot of the LaserWriter.
<P>
   During the manual feed, it is best to place a slight amount of pressure
   on the envelope as it is fed into the printer. This will ensure that
   the paper-feed mechanism will pull the paper smoothly and will reduce
   the risk of a paper jam.
