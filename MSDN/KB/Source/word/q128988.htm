The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If after receiving error messages in a Word version 6.0 document, you then
save the file in Word version 2.0 format, you may be unable to open the
file you just saved. You receive either of the following error messages
when you try to reopen the file in Word version 6.0:
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot open the document

   -or-

   WINWORD caused a General Protection Fault in module WINWORD.EXE

</PRE>If you try to open the file in Word version 2.0, you receive either of the
following messages:
<P>
<PRE>   There is an unrecoverable disk error on file rosoft 2.0.

   There is an unrecoverable disk error on file P8.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is a result of an embedded object turning into a blank box in
a reopened document, causing document corruption. When the original problem
is not corrected and you attempt to solve the problem by saving the file in
Word 2.0 format, one of the error messages listed at the beginning of this
article appears.
<P>
NOTE: This is NOT the same as the problem in which a Word 2.x document
object becomes corrupt after you edit it in Word 6.0, which is discussed in
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q115095.htm">Q115095</A></B>
   TITLE     : Embedded Object Becomes Blank Box in Reopened Document

</PRE>This problem described in this article happens with documents originally
created in Word 6.0. For additional information, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q112709.htm">Q112709</A></B>
   TITLE     : Word 2.x Document Object Corrupt After Editing in Word 6.0

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Word
version 7.0 for Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To correct the corrupted document so that you can open it in Word 6.0, do
the following:

<OL><P><LI>Start Word 2.0.

<P><LI>Turn off all toolbars, ribbons, and scrollbars.

<P><LI>Turn on draft view.

<P><LI>Open the document.

<P><LI>Look for a closing brace (sometimes called a right curly bracket). (It
   can be difficult to locate, as it is small.) This character contains the
   document corruption. Select the closing brace and delete it.

<P><LI>Save the file.
<P>
</OL>You can now open the document in Word version 6.0.
