The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Word for Windows over a network, the following error message
occurs if you are the twenty-first or subsequent user to access a read-only
file, such as NORMAL.DOT or an add-in program located in the shared
WINWORD\STARTUP subdirectory.
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot open this document template.

</PRE>If you choose OK, Word continues without the template or add-in.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The STORAGE.DLL file, supplied with Word, limits to 20 the number of users
who can open a single read-only file at the same time. STORAGE.DLL provides
OLE 2 (object linking and embedding) functionality.
<P>
This problem occurs only with read-only files; it does not occur with read-
write files.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word versions 6.0 and 6.0a
for Windows. This problem was corrected in Word version 7.0 for Windows 95.
An application note that corrects this problem is now available from
Microsoft Microsoft Technical Support. The application note is titled,
"WW1116: OLE Version 2.02". You can obtain this Application Note from the
following sources:

<UL><LI>Microsoft's World Wide Web Site on the Internet
<LI>The Internet (Microsoft anonymous ftp server)
<LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<LI>Microsoft FastTips Technical Library
<LI>Microsoft Microsoft Technical Support
<P>
</UL>For complete information, see the "To Obtain This Application Note" section
at the end of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have not used the appnote to update to OLE version 2.02, you can use
either of the following methods to enable more than 20 users to use a
file at the same time.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Change the attributes of the files to read/write. With this method, the
first user has read/write privileges to the file. Word prompts the second
and subsequent users to make a copy of the file.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Change the attributes of the files to read/write, as described in Method 1,
then add a Write Reservation Password to the files to prevent unauthorized
changes to the file. (To add a Write Reservation password, choose Save As
from the File menu and choose the Options button. Type a password in the
Write Reservation Password box and then choose OK.)
