<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the difference between outline numbering and outline
view. It also describes how to select an outline numbering style and use it
in a document.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Difference Between Outline Numbering and Outline View</h3>
 
<P>
Outline numbering is different from outline view. Outline view is used to
organize large documents, while outline numbering is used to create outline
style documents with special numbering or bullets for each level of the
document. Outline view uses indentation to display different levels of a
document.
<P>
While heading level numbering can be applied to a document created or
managed in outline view, outline numbering gives you more flexibility for
numbering headings.
<P>
<P><h3>Description of Outline View</h3>
 
<P>
Outline view formats levels of a document based on the heading levels you
specify. In outline view, document text appears to be indented and various
levels can be hidden to make it easier to get a clear picture of the
document's organization.
<P>
To reorganize the text, you can move levels and the sublevels will follow.
Levels are automatically promoted and demoted when moved. When you restore
the document to page layout view, the majority of the levels are not
indented. Various formats such as font, size, and bold, or italic, are
applied to each heading level style. This formatting can be viewed only
when the document is returned to page layout view.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Simple Outline Numbered Document</h3>
 
<P>
Outline numbering should be applied and viewed in page layout view. An
outline numbered document will be printed with the various levels of
indentation.
<P>
To create a simple outline using outline numbering, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In a new blank document type the following and press RETURN:
<P>
<P><PRE>      My Outline
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the new line type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Level 1
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Bullets And Numbering.

<P><LI>Click the Outline Numbered tab.

<P><LI>Click the second sample from the left on the top row. Click OK.
<P>
   Number 1) should appear to the left of Level 1.

<P><LI>Press RETURN.
<P>
   Number 2) should appear on the new line. Pressing TAB and SHIFT+TAB
   before you type any text will increase or decrease the indentation for
   this new line and will update its numbering appropriately.
<P>
   Once you have typed some text on the line, you can still promote or
   demote that line using the Increase and Decrease Indent buttons on the
   formatting toolbar. These entries can be more than one line in length.
   As you type, the lines will automatically wrap using a hanging indent.
<P>
   Another method of making changes to a numbered list is to press and hold
   the CONTROL key while you click an entry. This presents you with several
   options.
<P>
</OL>As you continue typing text in these entries you will continue to get new
lines with the appropriate numbering each time you press RETURN. However if
you press RETURN twice without typing anything, the automatic numbering
will stop. It can be restarted by clicking the Numbering button on the
Formatting toolbar. You can also use the Numbering button to remove or add
numbering for any entry. To do this, move the insertion point to the
appropriate line and click the Numbering button to toggle numbering on and
off.
<P>
To restart the numbering series, follow these steps::

<OL><P><LI>Place the insertion point in the entry where you want the numbering
   sequence to be restarted.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Bullets And Numbering.

<P><LI>Click the Outline Numbered tab.

<P><LI>Click Restart Numbering.
