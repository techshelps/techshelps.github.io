6.00a
WINDOWS
kb3rdparty kbprb
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Word for Windows, with Lotus cc:Mail as your electronic mail (E-mail)
program, if you use the Send or Add Routing Slip commands on the File menu
and access the address book, the names may not appear in the same order as
they display when you access the address book directly in cc:Mail.
<P>
For example, in Word, the names may display in "FirstName LastName" format,
sorted by either first or last name, while they appear in cc:Mail in
"LastName, FirstName" format, sorted by last name.
<P>
This discrepancy makes it difficult to look up names, especially in large
address books.
<P>
Note: The problem described in this article is not the same as the Word 6.0
MAPIVIM.DLL problem in which Word 6.0 hangs when you send E-mail via
cc:Mail. For information about this problem, which was corrected in Word
6.0a, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   mapivim.dll and hang and cc:mail and hourglass

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This discrepancy occurs only if you are using a version of the cc:Mail
VIM.DLL file with a creation date later than 09/09/93 and earlier than
03/22/94.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
Method 1: Lotus has an updated version of the VIM.DLL file, dated 03/22/94,
<PRE>          that corrects this problem. You can obtain this file from any of
          the following sources:

           - Phone cc:Mail Technical Support at (415) 966-4900.

           - Download the file VDLWIN.ZIP from the cc:Mail Technical
             Support BBS (bulletin board system) at (415) 691-0401.

           - Download the file VDLWIN.ZIP from CompuServe, in the cc:Mail-
             VIM section.

</PRE>Method 2: As a temporary workaround, you can install an earlier version of
<PRE>          the VIM.DLL file, dated 09/09/93 or earlier.

</PRE>The cc:Mail products included here are manufactured by Lotus Development
Corporation, vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied
or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
