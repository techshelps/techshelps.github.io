</PRE><h2>INSTALLING MICROSOFT WORD 97</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>IMPORTANT: Disable Virus Protection Before Running Setup</h3>
 
<P>
Some virus protection programs, such as VSafe.com and Norton Anti-Virus
Autoprotect, can interfere with the Microsoft Word 97 Setup program. If you
use a virus protection program on your computer, please disable it before
running Setup. (You can re-enable the virus protection program after Setup
is complete.) Note: If your virus-detection program starts automatically
when you start Windows, you can disable it by restarting Windows while
holding down the SHIFT key.
<P>
<P><h3>Minimum System Requirements for Microsoft Word 97</h3>
 
<P>
To use Microsoft Word 97, you need:

<UL><LI>Personal or Multimedia computer with a 486 or higher processor.
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 operating system or Windows NT Workstation 3.51
   with Service Pack 5 or later (will not run on earlier versions).
<LI>8 MB of memory for use on Windows; 16 MB of memory for use on
   Windows NT Workstation.
<LI>20-60 MB of hard disk space required; 46 MB required for typical
   installation, depending on configuration (use the Office Upgrade Wizard
   during Setup to maximize free disk space).
<LI>CD-ROM drive (coupon enclosed for 3.5-inch high-density disks; CD-ROM
   contains additional components such as Microsoft Internet Explorer,
   extra clip art, fonts, video files, and sounds not available on
   3.5-inch disks).
<LI>VGA or higher-resolution video adapter (Super VGA, 256-color
   recommended).
<LI>Microsoft Mouse, Microsoft IntelliMouse, or compatible pointing device.
<P>
</UL>Additional items or services required to use certain features:

<UL><LI>9600 or higher-baud modem (14,400 baud recommended).
<LI>Multimedia computer required to access sound and other multimedia
   effects.
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Client or Microsoft Outlook required to run WordMail.
   If you use Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft Exchange Service Pack 3
   (SP3) is required.
<LI>8 MB of additional memory required to run WordMail.
<LI>Some Internet functionality may require Internet access and payment of a
   separate fee to a service provider.
<P>
</UL><h3>Requirements for Microsoft Word 97 with Windows NT Workstation 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
To use Microsoft Word 97 with Windows NT Workstation 4.0, you must install
Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Punctuation Characters in Directory Names May Cause Problems</h3>
 
<P>
If the name of the directory you install Microsoft Office 97, Microsoft
Excel 97, Microsoft Outlook 97, Microsoft PowerPoint 97, or Microsoft Word
97 into includes a comma (,), single quotation mark ('), or exclamation
point (!), you may have problems when you use the programs. To avoid
problems, use the default directory or use only letters and numbers in
directory names.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Plus! Themes Patch</h3>
 
<P>
The Themes switcher installed with Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 is not
compatible with the new JPEG graphics filter installed with Word 97 or
Office 97. If you previously installed Themes from the Plus! Pack for
Windows 95, and you installed the JPEG graphics filter with Word 97 or
Office 97, you can upgrade your existing Themes program by getting the
Microsoft Plus! Themes Patch file from the ValuPack\Patch folder on the
Office 97 CD-ROM or on the network you installed Office from. If you
didn't install Office 97 from a CD-ROM and you have access to the World
Wide Web, point to Microsoft On The Web (Help menu) in any Office program,
and then click Free Stuff.
<P>
When you have located the Themes.exe patch file, perform the following
steps to upgrade your existing Themes program.

<OL><P><LI>Locate the folder on your hard disk that contains the program file
   Themes.exe. If you installed Plus! in the default location, then the
   file Themes.exe is located in \Program Files\Plus!.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - In Windows 95, click the Windows Start button, point to Find, and
      then click Files Or Folders. Search for the file Themes.exe on your
      hard disk.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - In Windows NT Workstation, click Search on the File menu in File
      Manager, and then search for the file Themes.exe.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Delete the file Themes.exe from your hard disk.

<P><LI>Copy the Themes.exe patch file from the Office 97 CD-ROM (or that
   you downloaded from the Web) to the folder on your hard disk that
   contained the file Themes.exe.
<P>
</OL><h2>MICROSOFT WORD 97 HELP AND GETTING RESULTS BOOK</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Help Topics Graphics Don't Print Clearly</h3>
 
<P>
When you print a Help topic that contains a graphic, the graphic may not
print clearly. In particular, this occurs when you print a topic with
gray-scale colors using a printer driver that does not have options to
control dithering.
<P>
<P><h3>Correction to Getting Results Book</h3>
 
<P>
On page 218, "Click Scrolling Text (Format menu)" should be "Click
Scrolling Text (Insert menu)".
<P>
<P><h2>WORKING WITH DOCUMENTS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Missing Characters when Opening Macintosh and Multilingual Documents</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a Macintosh or multilingual document, some of the characters
in the document may be missing. This occurs if you share Macintosh files
that use Chicago, Geneva, or Monaco fonts (these fonts are converted to
Arial, Courier New, or Times New Roman True Type fonts in Windows), or if
you share multilingual files that use Arial, Courier New, or Times New
Roman TrueType fonts, because the character may not be available using this
font. To make sure all of the characters appear in your converted Macintosh
or multilingual documents when the document uses Arial, Courier New, or
Times New Roman fonts, install international support for Central Europe,
Cyrillic, or Greek using the Windows 95 Setup program by performing the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Windows Start button, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

<P><LI>Click the Windows Setup tab.

<P><LI>In the Components box, select the Multilanguage Support check box.

<P><LI>Click Details.

<P><LI>In the Components box, select the Central Europe, Cyrillic, or Greek
   check box. Clear the other check boxes to save hard disk space.
<P>
</OL>Note that if you run Windows NT Workstation 3.5 or later, this problem does
not occur because the fonts included in Windows NT Workstation contain
support for international and extended characters.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Edit a Word Document Embedded Object in Word 95</h3>
 
<P>
When you insert a Word document as an embedded object in a document in Word
97, save the document in the Word 6.0/95 format or Rich Text Format, and
then open the document in Word 95, you may receive the error message "Word
cannot edit the object" when you double-click the object to edit it. This
occurs because when you save the document created in Word 97 in the Word
6.0/95 format or Rich Text Format, the embedded object is not saved as a
Word 95 document object. To edit the object, you must have Word 97
installed on your computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Edit an Embedded Object Created in a Word 95 Document after Saving</h3>
 
<P><h3>in Word 97</h3>
 
<P>
If you create an embedded object in a Word 95 document, open the document
in Word 97, and then save the document in Word 6.0/95 format or Rich Text
Format, the embedded object is updated to a later version of the OLE object
server program on the computer running Word 97. If you reopen the document
in Word 95 on a computer that does not have Word 97 or Office 97 installed,
you may not be able to edit the object.
<P>
This can occur with any OLE object, including objects created in Word 97
documents. To see a list of OLE server programs installed on your computer,
view the list in the Object dialog box (Insert Menu).
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Undo Edit After Attaching a Template</h3>
 
<P>
When you attach a different template to the active document, the Undo
command (Edit menu) is not available. This may occur after running a wizard
that attaches a template to the active document.
<P>
<P><h3>Mail Merge Errors in Microsoft Word 97 with Comma Separated Values or Tab</h3>
 
<P><h3>Separated Values Files Exported from Microsoft Outlook 97</h3>
 
<P>
When you export a file from Outlook as Comma Separated Values or Tab
Separated Values to use in a mail merge in Word, use the Map Custom Fields
dialog box in Outlook to select only the fields you want to export for the
mail merge. If you don't use the Map Custom Fields dialog box, you may get
unexpected results in Word.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKING WITH E-MAIL</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Using WordMail Templates</h3>
 
<P>
There are six custom e-mail templates and one blank e-mail template you can
use when you select Word as your e-mail editor in Microsoft Outlook or
Microsoft Exchange. (Some Help topics state that there are ten e-mail
templates available.)
<P>
<P><h3>Turning Off Word as E-mail Editor in Microsoft Exchange</h3>
 
<P>
If you do not want to use Word as your e-mail editor in Microsoft
Exchange, do the following in Microsoft Exchange:

<OL><P><LI>On the Compose menu, click WordMail Options.

<P><LI>Clear the Enable Word As E-mail Editor check box.
<P>
</OL><h3>Vendor Independent Messaging (VIM) Not Supported on Windows NT Workstation</h3>
 
<P>
If you use a 16-bit e-mail program compatible with Vendor Independent
Messaging (VIM), such as Lotus cc:Mail, on Windows NT Workstation, you are
not able to send or route documents.
<P>
<P><h2>MICROSOFT OFFICE 97 VALUPACK</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office 97 ValuPack Setup May Not Be Successful Without</h3>
 
<P><h3>Administrative Permissions</h3>
 
<P>
If you use Windows NT Workstation 3.51 or later, you must be a member of
the Administrators group to install some components of the Office 97
ValuPack.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office 97 Sounds Don't Work with Windows NT Workstation 3.51</h3>
 
<P>
The Office 97 sounds available in the Microsoft Office 97 ValuPack don't
work if you use Windows NT Workstation 3.51, even if the Provide Feedback
With Sound check box is selected on the General tab in the Options dialog
box (Tools menu) in the Office programs. Note that the sounds available
with the Office Assistant do work with Windows NT Workstation 3.51 if you
have selected the Make Sounds check box on the Options tab in the Office
Assistant dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Sharing Microsoft Word 97 Files with Earlier Versions of Microsoft Word</h3>
 
<P>
The Word 97 file format converter (Wrd97cnv.exe) is available on the
Microsoft Word 97 CD-ROM in the ValuPack\Wrd97cnv folder, in addition to
the locations mentioned in Microsoft Word 97 Help. For more information
about converting Word 97 files, see Microsoft Word 97 Help.

<P><h2>MICROSOFT VISUAL BASIC FOR APPLICATIONS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to Code Examples</h3>
 
<P>
Code examples in Microsoft Word Visual Basic Help (VbaWrd8.hlp) should be
changed as follows.
<P>

<UL><LI>OptionButton Control: The initial value of an OptionButton control is
   False.

<LI>ToggleButton Control: The initial value of a ToggleButton control is
   False.
<P>
</UL><h3>Events</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Click Event: When the user clicks on the active page or tab of a
   MultiPage or the active tab of a TabStrip, the Click event is initiated.
   However, if the MultiPage or TabStrip contains multiple rows of page
   tabs, the Click event is only initiated for tabs in the foremost row of
   pages.
<P>
</UL><h3>Properties</h3>
 

<UL><LI>AutoTab Property: When this property is True, the TabKeyBehavior
   property is not in effect.

<LI>AutoSize Property: Setting the AutoSize property to True adjusts the
   size of a control to fit the text within it.  If you change the text in
   a control after setting AutoSize to True, you must also set AutoSize to
   False and then back to True to get the control to resize.

<LI>DragBehavior Property: fmDragBehaviorEnabled should not be used with
   MatchRequired = True.

<LI>IMEMode Property: The following is a more detailed description of the
   IMEMode property.
<P>
<PRE>     IMEMode          Meaning
     -------          -------

     NoControl        The control does not affect the IME.

     On               Activates the IME without changing its language or
                      other settings.

     Off              Turns the IME off without affecting the language or
                      other settings.  In China, Off also switches the
                      keyboard to non-IME.

     Disabled         Makes the IME disappear so that its settings cannot
                      be changed.

</PRE></UL>All other values set the IME to a particular language.
<P>
Controls, such as command buttons, that do not allow typing will disable
the IME while they have focus.
<P>
Every control makes a copy of the IME state in effect when that control
receives focus. When it loses focus, it restores this saved state.  This
saving and restoring occurs without regard to the value of the IMEMode
property of the control. This differs slightly from the example in the
Help text.
<P>
Each change that a user makes to the IME while a control has focus
immediately updates that control's IMEMode property (if it has one).
<P>
All controls will accept setting all IME modes without error, but when a
mode is not "native" to a locale it will:
<P>
<PRE>     a. Not be listed in property sheets in that locale.

     b. Have the same effect as a native mode.  See below.

</PRE>All modes are native, except:
<P>
<PRE>     - Disabled is native only in Japan. Elsewhere, it acts like Off.

     - In Japan, the Hangul and Hanzi modes are not native. Using them has
       the same effect as using Hiragana.

     - In Korea, the only native modes are NoControl, Hanzi, and Alpha
       (Full and Half). Off and Disabled have the same effect as Alpha.
       On, Hiragana, Katakana, and Hanzi have the same effect as Hangul.

     - In China, the Hiragana, Katakana, Hangul, and Hanzi modes are not
       native. Using them has the same effect as HanziFull or Hanzi as
       appropriate.

     - Everywhere else, the only native mode is "NoControl."  All other
       modes have the effect of "NoControl."

</PRE><LI>List Property: The last sentence of the Help text is not correct. You
   can use the List property to copy an entire single dimension or
   multidimensional array of values to a control.

<LI>ListRows Property: Setting ListRows to 0 shows all the rows in the list.

<LI>MatchRequired Property: This property is in effect when the MatchEntry
   property is set to fmMatchEntryComplete or fmMatchEntryFirstLetter, but
   is not enforced when MatchEntry is set to fmMatchEntryNone.
<P>
   When the Input Method Editor (IME) is used to process keystrokes, the
   MatchRequired property does not always ensure that the user types a
   matching value in a ComboBox.

<LI>MultiLine Property: When this property is True, the TabKeyBehavior
   property is not in effect.

<LI>ScrollBars Property: Corrections to text are below.
<P>
<P><PRE>     - For a single-line control, replace Rule 2 with the following
       sentence: "When the ScrollBars property is set to
       fmScrollBarsHorizontal or fmScrollBarsBoth, the control shows a
       horizontal scroll bar if the text is longer than the edit region.
       The height of the control will not be changed, so the horizontal
       scroll bar may overlap the text in the control."
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     - Ignore Rule 3.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     - For a MultiLine control, ignore the third bulleted item in Rule 4.
</PRE>
<LI>ShowDropButtonWhen Property: If AutoSize is True, changing the
   ShowDropButtonWhen property immediately changes the size of the control
   based on whether the drop button is visible or hidden.

<LI>SpecialEffect Property: This property does not apply to the
   ToggleButton.

<LI>TabKeyBehavior Property: This property is enforced when AutoTab is False
   and MultiLine is True.

<LI>Value Property: The Value property of the TabStrip is an integer
   indicating the active tab. Zero indicates the first tab. The maximum
   value is one less than the number of tabs.

<LI>Visible Property: You are not allowed to change the Visible property of
   a control during the Layout event or Enter event. Doing so will cause an
   error at run time.
<P>
</UL><h3>Other Known Issues</h3>
 
<P>
The Marquee control included with Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 does not
work properly in Microsoft Forms 2.0.  This is a known problem that will
be fixed in a future release of Internet Explorer.
<P>
Calling "Unload Me" during the Enter event of a Microsoft Forms 2.0
CommandButton, OptionButton, or CheckBox may result in an "Out of stack
space" error or may cause an "illegal operation" error. The workaround is
to call "Unload Me" during the Click event instead.
