The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh versions 1.0, 3.0, 3.01, 3.02,
   4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word for the Macintosh is compatible with the Radius Color
Pivot monitor and the accompanying software SoftPivot and RadiusWare.
<P>
NOTE: Word versions 1.0, 3.0x, 4.0, 5.0, 5.1 will not operate
correctly with the Big Boundaries option set in the RadiusWare Control
Panel. (See below for steps to disable this option.) Word 6.0.1 is
incompatable with RadiusWare Control Panel version 1.5.
<P>
If the Big Boundaries option is enabled, Word may appear to stop responding 
after a dialog box appears on the screen. The dialog box appears and 
disappears, leaving the dialog box active so that other commands can't be 
selected and text cannot be typed. When Word appears to stop responding, 
pressing COMMAND+PERIOD (.) usually allows Word to continue.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To disable the Big Boundaries option, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Apple menu, click Control Panels.

<P><LI>Open the RadiusWare control panel.

<P><LI>Click the number 3 at the bottom of the RadiusWare window.

<P><LI>Click the Add button that now appears in the RadiusWare window
   to add Microsoft Word to the list of programs that need
   special settings.

<P><LI>When the dialog box appears, locate Microsoft Word.

<P><LI>With Microsoft Word selected in the list, turn the Big Boundaries
   option off. This option appears in the same window as the Add
   button. Close the control panel.

<P><LI>From the Special menu in the Finder, choose Restart for these
   changes to take effect.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The current version of RadiusWare is 2.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>About the Radius Color Pivot Monitor</h3>
 
<P>
The Radius Color Pivot monitor made by Radius, Inc., is an
82-dots-per-inch (dpi) monitor that can be used in either portrait
mode (640-by-870 pixels) or in landscape mode (870-by-640 pixels). The
monitor can switch between these two modes without restarting the
Macintosh.
<P>
Three control panel documents are used with this monitor. They are:
<P>
<PRE>   SoftPivot                  (Has INIT resources)
   RadiusWare                 (Has INIT resources)
   Color Pivot Resolutions    (Only used with Radius Interface card)

</PRE></OL>The SoftPivot and RadiusWare control panel documents have INIT
resources that allow them to load into memory when the computer is
started. Color Pivot Resolutions does not have INIT resources so that
it cannot affect other programs. Color Pivot Resolutions is a monitor
extension that allows the monitor resolution to be changed from 82 dpi
to 72 dpi ONLY when using a Radius Interface card.
<P>
Depending on the specific configuration, the Pivot monitor may run
fromthe built-in video port on a Macintosh or from a video card.
<P>
When using the built-in video port, it's necessary to use BOTH
SoftPivot and RadiusWare to take advantage of the Pivot monitor
features. A computer that is using this monitor can boot with these
control panels disabled; however, the monitor must first be placed in
portrait mode and it will not be able to switch to landscape mode.
