</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Version 5.0 of Microsoft Word for the Macintosh was announced on
Thursday, November 14, 1991, and has been available since early
January 1992, for a suggested retail price of $495.
<P>
To upgrade from Word 4.0 to Word 5.0, call Microsoft Sales Information
Center at (800) 426-9400 to place an order. The cost of the update is
$129.0 plus any applicable state/local tax and $5.50 for shipping/handling
by Federal Express second-day air. Users of all earlier versions of Word
can also upgrade to version 5.0 for $129. Users who bought Word 4.0
after November 1, 1991, can upgrade for free.
<P>
Upgrade coupons were sent to registered owners in January. The upgrade
will be available only from certain resellers. To receive an upgrade
from a participating retailer, you will need a Word Program disk or
the first page of a Word manual.
<P>
Microsoft Word for the Macintosh version 5.0 has been localized to
meet the language-specific needs of international markets. The English
version of Word 5.0 will be available in more than 120 countries
worldwide. French, German, French-Canadian, Italian, and Swedish
versions will be available in the first quarter of 1992. Dutch,
Norwegian, Danish, and Finnish versions will be available in the
second quarter of 1992. Turkish and Portuguese versions are also
planned.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To run Word 5.0, you must have a Macintosh Plus or later model
Macintosh, System 6.0.2 or later, and have at least 1 megabyte (MB) of
memory (2 MB of memory is recommended because it takes 2 MB to run the
grammar checker). If you are running Word under System 7.0 and want to
use the grammar checker, 4 MB of memory is suggested.
