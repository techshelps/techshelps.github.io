The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Resizing table columns using the Column Width command in Word 6.0 for
Windows can produce unexpected results in tables with merged cells.
<P>
If cells have been merged to the left of the column being resized, the
column width command may appear to skip a cell inside the column and adjust
a cell or cells outside the column instead. The cells affected are in the
row of the merged cell.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 for Windows uses relative cell references to count the position of
a cell from left to right. If you merge two or more cells, Word counts the
merged cells as one cell, thus reducing the number of cells in the row and
altering the cell references to the right of the merged cell. For example,
a cell that originated in column 4 may be placed into column 3 after cells
are merged to the left of it.
<P>
In Word 2.0 for Windows, merged cells affect column references only in
columns containing merged cells. Cells not in the column containing the
merged cells are not affected. In Word 6.0 for Windows, all column
references to the right of merged cells are affected.
<P>
To determine how a merged cell affects column selection, select the column
which you are attempting to resize by choosing Select Column from the Table
menu (or press ALT+Left Mouse Button). The highlight pattern will show how
Word is applying formats such as column width.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround 1</h3>
 
<P>
If possible, avoid merging cells in tables in which large amounts of column
formatting or calculations are being applied. Selective use of borders may
help cells to appear merged when printed.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround 2</h3>
 
<P>
In some cases, you can resize a column by placing the mouse pointer on the
gridline and holding down the CTRL key. This may allow you to resize all
the cells that appear to be in the same column. You may want to make a
backup of the document before you resize the column since this method could
affect the width of other columns to the right of the column you are
attempting to resize, which may result in undesirable formatting.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround 3</h3>
 
<P>
You can also break down the parts of the column before resizing to resize
the width of cells within an affected column:

<OL><P><LI>Select the portion of the column above the row with merged cells and
   adjust the width.

<P><LI>Select the portion of the column below and apply the new width.

<P><LI>Highlight the cell that appears to be affected by the merge. Make sure
   the whole cell is selected (including the end-of-cell marker if
   paragraphs are showing) and not just the contents of the cell.

<P><LI>From the Table menu, choose Column Width and adjust the width. By
   selecting an individual cell, you can adjust the width of one cell at a
   time.
