<P>
This article contains questions and answers about the 5.1a Patcher.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>   1. Q. What is the Word 5.1a Patcher and what does it do?

      A. The Word 5.1a Patcher corrects a problem with Word 5.1 that
         occurs when you fast save a document that contains footers
         and/or headers. This problem causes the footers and/or headers
         to disappear in the last section (or only section) of a
         document. The Word 5.1a Patcher corrects the Word program and
         identifies your version as Word 5.1a rather than Word 5.1.

   2. Q. Does this problem affect all copies of Word 5.1? How can I tell
         which version of Word I have?

      A. The problem affects all copies of Word 5.1 that have a file
         date earlier than November 4, 1992. When you run the Word 5.1a
         Patcher, the product version changes to 5.1a and the file date
         changes to November 4, 1992.

         Use one of the following two methods to check what version of
         Word you have:

          - In Word 5.1, choose About Microsoft Word from the Apple(R)
            menu. If the Word version listed is 5.1a and the date is
            November 4, 1992, your Word program has been updated.
            Otherwise, you need to run the Patcher.

             -or-

          - Activate the Macintosh Finder. Select the Microsoft Word
            application icon, and then choose Get Info from the File
            menu. If 5.1a appears next to Version, your Word program has
            been updated. Otherwise, you need to run the Patcher.

   3. Q. Can I prevent the problem from occurring before I run the
         Patcher?

      A. To prevent the problem from occurring before you run the
         Patcher, turn off the Fast Save option. To do this, use the
         following steps:

          1. From the Tools menu, choose Preferences.

          2. In the Preferences box, select the Open And Save category.

          3. Clear the Fast Save check box and then close the Preferences
             dialog box.

         NOTE: If the problem has already occurred, you cannot restore
         your footers and/or headers by running the Patcher program or
         by turning off Fast Save. You must retype them.

   4. Q. How can I obtain the Word 5.1a Patcher?

      A. The Patcher is offered free of charge to Word 5.1 users. There
         are several ways to obtain the Patcher.

          - If you have a modem, the fastest way to obtain the Word 5.1a
            Patcher is to download the Application Note ("MW0711: Word 5.1a
            Patcher").

            The following file is available for download from the Microsoft
            Software Library:
