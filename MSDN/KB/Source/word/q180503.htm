<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article answers the most frequently asked questions about the bullets
and numbering feature in Word 98.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. How do I create numbered headings in Word 98 that are suitable
      for technical or legal documents?

   A. You can automatically add numbers to the headings in a technical
      or legal document with the numbering format you choose by using
      the built-in heading styles. To do this, use the following steps:

      If you use the built-in heading styles to format headings in a
      document, you can automatically number headings with the numbering
      format you choose.

      a) On the Format menu, click Bullets and Numbering, and then click
         the Outline Numbered tab.

      b) Click a number format that contains the text "Heading 1,"
         "Heading 2," and so on.

      If you do not want to use built-in heading styles, you can still
      add numbers to the headings by using the following steps to link
      each heading to a numbered format:

      a) Make sure that the headings in the document are formatted with
         custom styles.

      b) On the Format menu, click Bullets And Numbering, and then click
         the Outline Numbered tab.

      c) Click a number format.

      d) Click Customize.

      e) In the Level or the Preview box, click the heading level you
         want to number.

         For example, if you want to number the top-level heading style
         which you've named "My Style 1" in your document, click 1 in the
         Level box.

      f) Click More.

      g) In the "Link level to style" box, click the style that corresponds
         to the level you selected in step e.

         For example, if you clicked 1 in the Level box, click My Style 1.

      h) Repeat steps e through g for each heading style in the document.

2. Q. How do I restart or interrupt the automatic numbering sequence
      in the middle of a list?

   A. You can restart the automatic numbering as follows:

      a) On the Format menu, click Bullets and Numbering.

      b) Under List Numbers, select the Restart Numbering option.

      NOTE: You can interrupt the current numbering sequence by pressing
      RETURN twice and then pressing DELETE once. Type the number you want
      the list to continue from, press TAB and type the text for the list
      number. Click the Number button and then press RETURN. Word will
      automatically continue the sequence from the number you inserted.

3. Q. How do I get Word to continue a numbered list that is interrupted
      by non-numbered text?

   A. You can get Word to continue a numbered list as follows:

      a) On the Format menu, click Bullets And Numbering.

      b) Click the numbering style you used in the list that you want
         to continue.

      c) Under List Numbers, select the Continue Previous List option.

4. Q. How do I make Word recognize and help me create a multi-level
      list that mixes numbers and letters?

   A. Word refers to multi-level lists as outline numbered lists and
      recognizes seven pre-defined list formats. To apply one of the
      pre-defined formats, do the following:

      a) On the Format menu, click Bullets And Numbering.

      b) Click the Outline Numbered tab.

      c) Click the list format you want to use, and then click OK.

      To create a custom format, use the following steps:

      a) On the Format menu, click Bullets And Numbering, and then click
         Outline Numbered tab.

      b) Click Customize.

      c) Click the level you want to modify in the Level or the Preview
         box. Then, change the formats for that level.

         Repeat steps a-c for each level you want to modify.

5. Q. How do I number items in an outline level list or include more than
      one numbering level on a single line?

    A. In an outline numbered list, you can use the LISTNUM field to
       number items or to include more than one numbering level on a
       single line.

       For example, if the list item is "1. a)," you can use the LISTNUM
       field to automatically insert "a)," "b)," and any subsequent items
       on the same numbering level. To insert a LISTNUM field, do the
       following:

       a) On the Insert menu, click Field.

       b) In the Categories box, double-click Numbering.

       c) In the Field names box, double-click ListNum.

       d) Type the text for the list item, and then press ENTER.

       e) To insert the next number at the same level, for
          example (ii), repeat steps a-d.

6. Q. How do I reapply Outline Numbering to a document once the numbering
      has been removed?

   A. When you apply Outline Numbering to a document, remove the numbering
      format from all the paragraphs, and then reapply the format, Word
      reapplies Outline Numbering only to the paragraph that contains the
      insertion point. To reset paragraph formatting:

      a) Select the paragraphs from which you removed the Outline
         Numbering format.

      b) Press COMMAND+OPTION+Q.

      This method resets the paragraph formatting for the selected
      paragraph to the default formatting and reapplies the Outline
      Numbering format.
