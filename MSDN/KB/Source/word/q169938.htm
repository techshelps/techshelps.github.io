<P>
   -or-

<LI>On the File menu, click "Exit and Return to Document" (or "Exit and
   Return to Presentation").
<P>
</UL><h3>Creating a New Image</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click New.

<P><LI>In the Image Type list, click the type you want.

<P><LI>Type the settings you want in the Resolution, Height, Width, and Unit
   boxes and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Opening an Existing Image</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Open.

<P><LI>In the Look in box, open the folder that contains the image.

<P><LI>In the list of files, select the image you want.

<P><LI>Click Open.
<P>
</OL><h3>Previewing an Image Before Opening It</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Open.

<P><LI>Select the image you want to preview.

<P><LI>Click Preview.
<P>
   The Preview dialog box appears. You can crop, resize, or cancel the
   preview.  To crop the image, drag the edge of the frame in the preview
   window. To resize the image, drag any corner of the frame. To accept the
   cropping or resizing changes, click OK. To cancel the preview, click
   Cancel. To restore the image to its original settings, click Reset.
<P>
   NOTE: You cannot increase the size of the picture and you cannot resize

</OL><h3>Creating a new Image with a Colored Background</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click New.

<P><LI>Click Color.

<P><LI>Click the color you want and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK again.
<P>
</OL><h3>Changing Resolution and Orientation Settings for a Kodak Photo CD Image</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select a Kodak Photo CD image.

<P><LI>Click Options.

<P><LI>In the Resolution section, click Default Resolution or click one of the
   options in the Specific Resolution drop-down list. Click either the
   8-bit or 24-bit option.

<P><LI>In the Orientation section, select the type of orientation you want.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Although setting a high resolution improves the quality of the image

the image.
<P>
<P><h3>Scanning an Image with Microsoft Photo Editor</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Scan Image.

<P><LI>Follow the directions for the scanner.
<P>
</OL><h3>Selecting a Scanner</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Select Scanner Source.

<P><LI>In the Sources list, click the scanner you want to use.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You can select another TWAIN device, such as a digital camera,
instead of a scanner. You can select any TWAIN device that is attached to
your computer if it appears in the Sources box. If you scanner is not
listed in the Sources box,

<UL><LI>The scanner is not TWAIN-compliant. Photo Editor recognizes only
   TWAIN-compliant scanners.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The scanner and its software is not installed correctly. Follow the
   manufacturer's instructions for installing the scanner and software.
<P>
</UL><h3>Using the Optimum Scanning Resolution</h3>
 
<P>
Use the optimum scanning resolution to keep images from getting
unnecessarily large. Do this by matching the scanning resolution to the
capacity of the output device. If an image has more resolution than a
printer can print, the printer simply ignores the excess. The best scanning
resolution is equal to two times the number of lines per inch (lpi) of the
printer. The following table will help you select the optimum scanning
resolution.
<P>
<PRE>   Output device     Output dpi     Output lpi     Scanning dpi
   ------------------------------------------------------------

   Monitor              96              na              96
   Laser printer       300            55-65            120
   Laser printer       600            65-85            150

   Imagesetter        1250+         120-150            300

</PRE></OL>NOTE: The figures for scanning dots per inch (dpi) are the most common for
that kind of device. Check the user's manual for your printer or monitor if
you want to determine the output lpi and scanning dpi more precisely.

<UL><LI>Photo Editor does not open an image. This behavior can occur when either
   of the following are true:
<P>
   - The proper import filter may not be installed on your computer. To
<P><PRE>     install the graphics import filter rerun Setup in maintenance mode and
     select the filter you want.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     -or-
</PRE><P>
   - The image may have been saved in an unrecognized graphics file
<P><PRE>     format. Some file formats, especially TIFF and some others, are
     adapted for specialized purposes. Some of the adaptations are not
     recognized by standard import filters. Usually these images can be
     opened only by the program that created them.
</PRE>
<LI>The document or presentation file size is getting too large.
<P>
   - Large images, or a large number of images, can slow performance when
<P><PRE>     you scroll, print or perform other normal operations. You can reduce
     the size of your images using any of the following methods:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     - Change an image to true color, palette, grayscale, or monochrome.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     - Reduce the resolution and resize the image.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     - Use the optimum scanning resolution.
</PRE><P>
</UL>NOTE:  To reduce the size of your images even more, paste the image into
your document or presentation instead of using OLE.
<P>
<P><h3>Compression options</h3>
 
<P>
JPEG. Reduces the number of bits in the image by eliminating repetitive
image data or image data that is hard to see. JPEG can achieve much greater
compression than other methods, but the results may not be fully
reversible. At higher compression ratios (greater than 20:1), JPEG degrades
the quality of the image. JPEG is available only for true color images.
<P>
LZW (Lempel-Zif compression). Translates common patterns in an image into
short codes. LZW is best at preserving all the image data and achieving
good compression, but it does not achieve the high compression ratios that
JPEG does. LZW is available for monochrome, grayscale, palette, and true
color images. GIF and interlaced GIF use LZW compression.
<P>
LZW and Differencing. Compresses the differences between adjacent pixels
instead of the actual value of the distance between them. Differencing
enhances LZW compression. LZW and Differencing is available for grayscale,
palette, and true color images.
<P>
RLE (Run Length Encoding). Associates a count with a pixel value. For
example, a line of 250 blue pixels is encoded by the number 250, followed
by the numerical value for blue. RLE gives good compression ratios for
images that have large blocks of constant color. RLE is available for
monochrome images as well as palette and true color Windows Bitmap (*.bmp)
images.
<P>
CCITT Group 3 and Group 4. Uses modified Huffman encoding, in which pixels
are compressed based on a table of patterns that represents the typical
patterns in an image. These are facsimile-compatible compression routines.
CCITT is available for monochrome images only. CCITT Group 3 provides good
results with text but poor results with images. CCITT Group 4 compresses an
image in two dimensions and usually produces a higher compression ratio
than Group 3. Many programs support Group 3 but not Group 4.

<P><h3>Saving Transparency in an Image</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Photo Editor supports three file formats that save transparency:
CompuServ GIF (GIF), Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), and Portable Network
Graphics (PNG). Transparency in an image is saved in two ways: as a
transparent color or in an alpha channel.
<P>
GIF saves images as monochrome (line art) or 8-bit (grayscale or 256-color)
images. GIF saves all transparency values by substituting a transparent
color in place of the designated color. If you are concerned about loss of
image data, use TIFF or PNG to save your image. If you prefer GIF and want
to preserve all the image data, save a copy of your image in another format
before saving transparency conversions in GIF.
<P>
TIFF saves images as monochrome, 8-bit, or 24-bit (true color) images. In
24-bit images, TIFF saves transparency in an alpha channel. For monochrome
and 8-bit TIFF images, however, Microsoft Photo Editor does not save
transparency.
<P>
PNG saves images as 8-bit or 24-bit images. In 24-bit images, PNG saves
transparency in an alpha channel. In 8-bit images, PNG substitutes a
transparent color on the palette.
