<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
AutoCorrect lists are shared between Office programs. Any changes you make
to the AutoCorrect entries and settings while in one program are
immediately available to the other programs. In addition, Word can store
AutoCorrect items that consist of formatted text and graphics.
<P>
Information pertaining to AutoCorrect is stored in various locations. These
locations are listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   This AutoCorrect information                 Is stored here
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   AutoCorrect entries shared by all            Default MS Office ACL (8)
   programs                                     in the path Microsoft
                                                Office 98:Office

   AutoCorrect entries used only by             Normal
   Word (formatted text and graphics)

   AutoCorrect settings (correct two initial    MS Office ACL (8) in the
   capitals, capitalize names of days,          System:Preferences folder
   replace text as you type)

   AutoCorrect settings used only by            Word Settings(8)
   Word (Correct TWo INitial CApitals,
   Capitalize first letter of sentences)

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Shared AutoCorrect Items Stored in ACL Files</h3>
 
<P>
The first time you use a Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition program,
such as Microsoft Word 98, a default list of AutoCorrect items is copied
from Default MS Office ACL(8) to a new file, which is called MS Office
ACL(8)1.
<P>
When you add a new AutoCorrect entry in any of the Office programs, that
program immediately updates an MS Office ACL(8) file in the
System:Preferences folder and adds a sequential number to the end of the
file name, for example MS Office ACL(8)1. This new AutoCorrect entry is
available to all the other programs that also use AutoCorrect.
<P>
Location of the ACL File
 
<P>
The MS Office ACL(8)&lt;n&gt; file (where &lt;n&gt; is the number of the latest
revision) is usually located in the System:Preferences folder. To determine
where this file is stored, use the Finder to look in the Macintosh HD. To
do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Finder, on the File menu, click Find.

<P><LI>Type ACL in the fill-in box, and then click Find.
<P>
</OL><h3>Location of the Settings Information</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Office 98, other AutoCorrect settings are stored in the
same location in the following folder:
<P>
<PRE>   MACINTOSH HD:System Folder:Preferences

</PRE></OL><h3>Word Stores Additional AutoCorrect Entries</h3>
 
<P>
Word's built-in list of AutoCorrect entries includes items that don't
appear in other programs, such as an entry that consists of a colon and a
closing parenthesis that is replaced by a "smiley face" symbol.
<P>
Word can also store graphics and formatted text as AutoCorrect entries.
These entries are not available to other programs. (To store something as
an AutoCorrect entry in Word, type the text or insert the graphic you
want to store, select it, and then click AutoCorrect on the Tools menu. The
selected area appears on the "With" side, and you can type a short name in
the "Replace" side.)
<P>
NOTE: AutoCorrect does not to use WordArt, AutoShapes, Clipart, or graphics
for which the "Float Over Text" option is selected unless the "Formatted
text" button is selected in AutoCorrect.
<P>
For Microsoft Word 98, the AutoCorrect options Correct TWo INitial CApitals
and Capitalize First Letter Of Sentences are stored in the following file:
