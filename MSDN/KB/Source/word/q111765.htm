<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains the complete text of the cover letter supplied with
the Word version 6.0a for Windows patch (UPGRADE.DOC).
<P>
At the end of this article, in the "Additional Error Messages" section,
there is a list of the Word 6.0a Patch error messages that are NOT
documented in UPGRADE.DOC. This section includes troubleshooting
information.
<P>
For information about the problems corrected in Word 6.0a, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Thank you for choosing Microsoft Word, the world's most popular word
processor. By running the UPGRADE.EXE program contained on the disk
in this package, you can upgrade Microsoft Word 6.0 to version 6.0a.
You must have Microsoft Word 6.0 already installed on your hard
drive, because this disk contains only the differences between Word
6.0 and Word 6.0a. In addition, you must have 8 MB of space available
on your hard drive. During the upgrade process, UPGRADE.EXE creates a
duplicate of some of the Word 6.0 application files and stores them
as temporary files on your hard drive. These temporary files will be
deleted when the upgrade is complete.
<P>
Note: This disk is intended for upgrading the installation on your
local hard drive, not network installations. To upgrade a shared
installation on a network server, you must use a complete Word 6.0a
disk set.To obtain Word 6.0a, call the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-
7561 and request Word version 6.0a for Windows. If you are outside the
United States, contact your local subsidiary. To locate your subsidiary,
see the Microsoft World Wide Offices Web site at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm</A></B>

</PRE>UPGRADE.EXE examines the Word 6.0 application on your hard drive,
comparing the dates of the Word 6.0 application files to the dates on
the upgrade disk. If the dates on the Word 6.0 application files are
earlier, UPGRADE.EXE copies the new portions from the upgrade disk
into the application files on your hard drive. This upgrade does not
affect your existing documents. However, when you open a Word 6.0
document in Word 6.0a, the document will be converted to the newer
format.
<P>
<P><h2>To Upgrade From Word 6.0 to Word 6.0a</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Close all applications, including Word.

<P><LI>If Windows is not running, start Windows.

<P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Word 6.0a for Windows Update Disk in the
   appropriate high-density floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>In the Program Manager window, choose Run from the File menu.

<P><LI>In the Command Line box, type the drive letter for the drive
   containing the Upgrade disk, followed by a colon and the word
   "upgrade.exe". For example, type "a:upgrade.exe" (without the
   quotation marks). Then choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions on the screen. When the upgrade is
   complete, choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL><h2>TROUBLESHOOTING</h2>
 
<P>
Listed below are the possible error messages that might come up
during the installation, along with an explanation of the
circumstances that might cause the error and suggestions for
correcting the problem. In most cases, when you click the OK button
in the message box, UPGRADE.EXE skips the file listed in the message
and continues upgrading the remaining files.
<P>
<P><h3>[...] is not the correct version for this upgrade</h3>
 
<P>
This message appears if the version of Word on your hard drive is
anything other than Word 6.0. Reinstall Word 6.0, then use
UPGRADE.EXE to upgrade to Word 6.0a.
<P>
<P><h3>There is insufficient disk space to complete this upgrade</h3>
 
<P>
When you start UPGRADE.EXE, the program checks the disk space
available on your hard drive. If insufficient space is available,
this message appears and the upgrade is stopped. During the upgrade,
you should have approximately 8 MB of space available on your hard
drive.
<P>
<P><h3>There is insufficient memory to complete this upgrade</h3>
 
<P>
There is insufficient RAM memory available. Close other applications
and restart your computer.
<P>
Unable to initialize the application
Unable to initialize the task instance
<P><h3>Unable to initialize the Windows timer</h3>
 
<P>
UPGRADE.EXE or one if its components is unable to run. Close other
applications and restart your computer, then run UPGRADE.EXE.
<P>
<P><h3>Unable to find the stf file in the win.ini</h3>
 
<P>
This message indicates that your existing Word 6.0 installation is
incomplete. Reinstall Word 6.0, and then run UPGRADE.EXE again.
<P>
<P><h3>Unable to create a temporary file</h3>
 
<P>
During the upgrade process, UPGRADE.EXE creates a duplicate of some
Word 6.0 application files and stores them as temporary files on your
hard drive. These temporary files will be deleted when the upgrade is
complete. This message appears if you have insufficient space
available on your hard drive for these temporary files to be created.
Delete unnecessary files on your hard drive to free up space, and
then run UPGRADE.EXE again.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot locate the file [...]</h3>
 
<P>
UPGRADE.EXE looks for the components of Word 6.0 in their default
locations--that is, the locations where they were originally
installed. You may have moved or deleted the file. When you click the
OK button, the upgrade will skip that component and continue
upgrading the components it can locate. (If you suspect that some of
the original Word 6.0 components may have been deleted or moved, you
can ensure a complete upgrade by reinstalling Word 6.0 before running
UPGRADE.EXE.)
<P>
<P><h3>A file system error has occurred on file [...]</h3>
 
<P>
The file listed in the message may be open. For example, the Word
Help file might be open even though Word is not running. Look for
other applications that are keeping the file open or locked and close
those applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot open the file [...]</h3>
 
<P>
This message occurs if the file that is being upgraded is currently
open. Click OK to continue without upgrading that particular file.
Then close all files and run UPGRADE.EXE again.
<P>
<P><h3>The patch to file [...] was not applied</h3>
 
<P>
The target file on your hard drive may be corrupt. Restart your
computer and run UPGRADE.EXE again. If you receive the same message
on the same file, try deleting the specified file, reinstalling Word
6.0, and then running UPGRADE.EXE again.
<P>
<P><h3>There is an error reading file [...]</h3>
 
<P>
There may have been an operating system error. Restart your computer
and run UPGRADE.EXE again.
<P>
<P><h3>There is an error writing file [...]</h3>
 
<P>
You may have run out of disk space on your hard drive. Click OK to
skip this file and continue the upgrade. When the upgrade is
finished, delete some unneeded files to make room on your hard drive,
and then run UPGRADE.EXE again to upgrade the file or files that were
skipped.
<P>
<P><h3>Error writing to system.ini</h3>
 
<P>
This message occurs if the system.ini file is locked by some other
application, such as a text editor. Close all other applications and
DOS sessions and run UPGRADE.EXE again.
<P>
<P><h2>ADDITIONAL ERROR MESSAGES</h2>
 
<P>
The following error messages may occur when you install the Word 6.0a
patch, but they are not included in the UPGRADE.DOC cover letter supplied
with the patch.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Find SETUP.STF in WIN.INI</h3>
 
<P>
This message occurs, and the installation aborts, if the Word 6.0a Patch
cannot find a valid SETUP.STF line in the [MS Setup (ACME) Table Files]
section of your WIN.INI file. This happens if you last installed a beta
version of Word 6.0 (a pre-release version of the application used for
testing) instead of the retail version of the product (from the Word
program disks) or if you have already upgraded to Word 6.0a. To resolve
this error message, you must remove the beta Word version and install Word
6.0 using the disks that came with your Word package; then you can run
UPGRADE.EXE to install the Word 6.0a Patch.
<P>
The following is a valid WIN.INI entry that the patch can use to find your
Word 6.0 SETUP.STF file:
<P>
[MS Setup (ACME) Table Files]
WINWORD.EXE@v6.0.0.2226(1033)=C:\WINWORD\SETUP\SETUP.STF
<P>
In the above WIN.INI entry, if 2226 is any other number, the line is
invalid and the error message occurs. If the number is 2513, you have
previously performed a full installation of Word 6.0a (using the full disk
set instead of the patch), so you do not need to run the patch. To double-
check the version of Word you have installed, choose About Microsoft Word
from the Help menu in Word.
<P>
IMPORTANT: You cannot resolve this error by manually modifying or adding
the above WIN.INI entry. If you do this, the patch might modify the wrong
code in your Word files, which could have unexpected results.
<P>
<P><h3>Wrong Version of WWINTL.DLL Loaded</h3>
 
<P>
This error message occurs if you run the U.S. version of the Word 6.0a
patch on an international localized version of Word 6.0. After you finish
or quit running the patch, you may be unable to start your localized
version of Word. If this happens, do the following to restore
functionality:

<OL><P><LI>Run Word Setup and choose the Uninstall installation option.

<P><LI>Run Word Setup again to reinstall Word 6.0.
<P>
</OL>The most current version of Word 6.x for Windows is Word 6.0c. To obtain
this update, contact the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561 and request
the Word 6.0c update. If you are outside the United States, contact the
Microsoft subsidiary for your area. To locate your subsidiary, see the
