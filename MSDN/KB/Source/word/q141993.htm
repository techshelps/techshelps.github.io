<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the types of section breaks available in Word
and their uses. When you start a document, there are no section breaks
because the entire document consists of one section. A section break is
the point at which you end one section and begin another because you
want some aspect of page formatting to change. You can divide a
document into any number of sections and format each section the way
you want. Throughout this article, keep in mind that a section break
acts as an embedded code that stores or maintains the properties of the
section above it.
<P>
For helpful hints about using section breaks, refer to the "More
Information" section of this article.
<P>
Section/Page properties include the following settings:
<P>
<PRE>   Page Orientation (Portrait/Landscape)
   Margins
   Columns
   Line Numbering
   Vertical Alignment
   Headers &amp; Footers
   Page Numbering
   Paper Size
   Paper Source

</PRE>It is recommended that when you are working with section breaks that
you turn on the Show Hide information by:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the View tab.

<P><LI>Under Non Printing Characters, click to select ALL.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Using Section Breaks</h3>
 
<P>
Word 97 for Windows
<P>
To create a new section, click the Break command on the Insert menu. In
Normal view, Word displays a double dotted line and the words End of
Section (Type of Section Break) to indicate a section break and its
type.
<P>
Word 95 for Windows and earlier
<P>
To create a new section, click the Break command on the Insert menu. In
Normal view, Word displays a double dotted line and the words End of
Section to indicate a section break.
<P>
The line is not printed. There are several types of section
breaks to choose from. The breaks and their purposes are described as
follows.
<P>
<PRE>   Type           Characteristics
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Next Page      Word breaks the page at the section break. The new
                  section starts on the next page.

                  Use this section break if you want to apply different
                  page numbers, headers and footers, orientation,
                  vertical alignment, or paper size to the sections in
                  the document.

   Continuous     Word inserts a section break and begins the new section
                  on the same page. If the two sections have different
                  settings for page size or orientation, the new section
                  begins a new page even if you select Continuous.

                  Use this section break if you want to have different
                  column formatting or margins on the same page. If there
                  are multiple columns in the previous section, Word
                  balances the columns above the section break and then
                  fills out the page with the new section.

   Odd Page       Word begins the new section on the next odd-numbered
                  page. This section break is often used for chapters that
                  begin on odd-numbered pages.

                  NOTE: If the section break falls on an odd-numbered
                  page, Word leaves the intervening even-numbered page
                  blank.

   Even Page      Similar to Odd Page, but Word begins the new section on
                  the next even-numbered page.

</PRE></OL><h3>To Insert a Section Break</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click at the point where you want to start a new section.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Break.

<P><LI>Under Section Breaks, select the option that describes what type of
   section break you want, as described above.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Determining the Type of Section Break</h3>
 
<P>
Word 97
<P>
In Word 97 for Windows, the type of section Break is shown on your
Screen, in parenthesis, after the words Section Break. This is not
where the properties of that section break are stored. The properties
for the type of section break indicated on the screen are stored in
the next section break (which may have a different type of section
break indicated). If there is no additional section break in your
document, then the properties for that section break are stored in
the last paragraph mark of the document. The section breaks act as an
embedded code that stores or maintains the properties of the section
above it.
<P>
For Example, if you have a one page document and half way down the
page, you insert an Odd Page Section Break and then further into your
document on Page 1, you insert a Next Page Section Break, in Normal
view, you will see the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Section Break (Odd Page)

   Section Break (Next Page)

</PRE></OL>If you place your insertion point above Section Break (Odd Page), the
Status Bar will show: Page 1 Sec 1. To see the actual properties for
the first section, on the File menu, click Page Setup and then click
the Layout tab. Under Section Start, it will indicate that the section
is New Page. The settings for this section break are stored in the
section break below where your insertion point is located or as shown
on the screen, Section Break (Odd Page).
<P>
If you place your insertion point between Section Break (Odd Page) and
Section Break (Next Page), the Status Bar will show: Page 3 Sec 2. To
see the actual properties for the second section, on the File menu,
click Page Setup and then click the Layout tab. Under Section Start,
it will indicate that the section is Odd Page. The settings for this
section break are stored in the section break below where your
insertion point is located or as shown on the screen, Section Break
(Next Page).
<P>
If you place your insertion point below Section Break (Next Page), the
Status Bar will show: Page 4 Sec 3. To see the actual properties for
the third section, on the File menu, click Page Setup and then click
the Layout tab. Under Section Start, it will indicate that the section
is New Page. The settings for this section break are stored in the last
paragraph mark of the document (since there are no more section breaks
in the document
<P>
Note: A section break indicated on your screen as Next Page will be
defined as New Page on the Layout tab of the Page Setup dialog box.
<P>
Word 7.x and earlier
<P>
In Word 7.x for Windows and earlier, in Normal view, the words End of
Section are shown on your screen at every point where you have a
section break. The properties for a particular section are contained
in the section break below the section. If there are no additional
sections in your document, then the properties for that section are
stored in the last paragraph mark of the document. The section breaks
act as an embedded code that stores or maintains the properties of the
section above it.
<P>
For Example, if you have a one page document and half way down the
page, you insert an Odd Page Section Break and then further into your
document on Page 1, you insert a Next Page Section Break, in Normal
view, you will see the following:
<P>
<PRE>   End of Section

   End of Section

</PRE>If you place your insertion point above the first End of Section
marker, the Status Bar will show: Page 1 Sec 1. To see the actual
properties for the first section, on the File menu, click Page Setup
and then click the Layout tab. Under Section Start, it will indicate
that the section is New Page. The settings for this section break are
stored in the section break below where your insertion point is
located or the first End of Section marker on your screen.
<P>
If you place your insertion point between the first and second End of
Section mark on your screen, the Status Bar will show: Page 3 Sec 2.
To see the actual properties for the second section, on the File menu,
click Page Setup and then click the Layout tab. Under Section Start, it
will indicate that the section is Odd Page. The settings for this
section break are stored in the section break below where your
insertion point is located or the second End of Section marker on your
screen.
<P>
If you place your insertion point below the second End of Section mark,
the Status Bar will show: Page 4 Sec 3. To see the actual properties
for the third section, on the File menu, click Page Setup and then
click the Layout tab. Under Section Start, it will indicate that the
section is New Page. The settings for this section break are stored in
the last paragraph of the document (because there are no more section
breaks in the document).
<P>
Note: A section break indicated on your screen as Next Page will be
defined as New Page on the Layout tab of the Page Setup dialog box.

You can save a section break and the formatting it contains as an
AutoText entry for future use.

above the section break takes on the formatting contained in the
section break.
