<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
You can create mathematical formulas in a Word for Windows document by
using the EQ field, also referred to as a Formula field. However,
these formulas can only be printed on printers that have the Symbol
font. If the Symbol font is not available on the installed printer,
the field codes can be entered in the document, but they will not
display or print properly.
<P>
The EQ field can be created in two ways:

<OL><P><LI>Enter the field code manually by holding down the CTRL key and
   pressing the F9 key once (CTRL+F9). This will place field code
   characters, which look like opening and closing braces, around the
   insertion point. To produce the formula, type "eq" (without the
   quotation marks) followed by a space, and then type the switches
   and arguments necessary to achieve the desired results. Use this
   method for formulas that will become very complicated or that use
   switch nesting to obtain the desired result.

<P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Field and then select Formulas from
   the Insert Field Type box. This will place "eq" (without the
   quotation marks) in the Field Code box. From the Instructions box,
   select one of the options. Then choose the Add button to place the
   appropriate switch, along with the appropriate parentheses and
   commas, in the Field Code box. This method does not allow nesting
   of switches or selecting of arguments to use with the switches, and
   as a result, is somewhat limited in complexity.
<P>
</OL>The EQ field can contain any number of switches and arguments, as well
as text. Text can be entered in the EQ field before or after a switch
and its associated arguments. The text will not be affected by the
switch or its arguments but will be a part of the result of the field
code. The result of the field code will always be treated as one
element and cannot wrap around to another line. Therefore, the only
limitation of the EQ field code is that the result of the code must
not exceed one line. The code used to produce the result can be as
long as necessary.
<P>
<P><h3>Switches</h3>
 
<P>
The EQ field has 10 switches that control the formatting of the result
of the formula. Many of these switches have associated arguments that
control the formatting determined by the switches.
<P>
The complete application note contains explanations of each of the
switches and each argument associated with that particular switch, as
well as some examples of the use of the switches and their arguments.
