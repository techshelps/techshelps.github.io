The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Word, you can create a multiple-section document with different page
numbering in each section. To specify a page or a range of pages to print,
you must supply both the page and section number of the range you want to
print. In a multiple-section document that contains more than a single page
1, Word cannot determine which "page 1" to print unless you also supply a
section number.
<P>
<P><h3>Word versions 6.0 and later for Windows and Word 98 Macintosh Edition</h3>
 
<P>
To print a range of pages within a nonadjacent section or across sections,
use the following syntax in the Pages box:
<P>
<PRE>   p&lt;page number&gt;s&lt;section number&gt;-p&lt;page number&gt;s&lt;section number&gt;

</PRE>For example, to print page 5 of section 3 through page 2 of section 4,
type "p5s3-p2s4" (without the quotation marks).
<P>
To print nonadjacent pages or nonadjacent sections, type the page and
section numbers, separated by commas (,). For example, to print
sections 3 and 5 (not section 4), type "s3,s5" (without the quotation
marks). To print pages 2 through 5 of section 3 and pages 1 through 4
of section 5, type "p2s3-p5s3,p1s5-p4s5" (without the quotation marks).
<P>
For more information, choose the Help button in the Print dialog box
and then select the "Setting Printing Options" topic.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 2.x</h3>
 
<P>
To print pages 1 through 12 in section 3, type "p1s3" and "p12s3" in
the From and To boxes, respectively.
<P>
NOTE: The page numbers should correspond to the formatted page number
and not the physical page number in the document. You may need to
repaginate your document to determine the correct page numbers for
printing.
<P>
