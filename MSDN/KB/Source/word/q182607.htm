The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Direct Mail Manager for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Direct Mail Manager to verify your addresses, not all
addresses are checked for duplicates.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This functionality is by design. Direct Mail Manager will not check non-
verified addresses for duplicates.
<P>
NOTE: Only addresses that are verified can be included in a discount
mailing.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, either correct or remove the non-verified
addresses in your address list.
<P>
<P><h3>Correcting Non-Verified Addresses</h3>
 
<P>
For more information about correcting (editing) your address list, click
Help in Direct Mail Manager, click the Index button in Direct Mail Manager
Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   Edit addresses

</PRE>and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Edit List step"
topic.
<P>
<P><h3>Removing Non-Verified Addresses</h3>
 
<P>
To remove non-verified addresses, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Direct Mail Manager, step through the process of importing and
   verifying your address list.

<P><LI>When Direct Mail Manager shows you the "Address Verification Results"
   dialog box, click OK.

<P><LI>When Direct Mail Manager prompts you with "To edit, click anywhere and
   type the correct information," change Limit List To "Non-verified
   Addresses."

<P><LI>Select each non-verified address (and duplicate) by holding down CTRL
   and clicking on the little gray box directly to the left of each
   address.

<P><LI>Once the non-verified addresses are all selected, press DELETE to delete
   the non-verified addresses.

<P><LI>Click Yes when the following message is displayed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Are you sure you want to delete these addresses?
</PRE><P>
</OL>Once the non-verified addresses are deleted from your updated address list,
click Next to continue Direct Mail Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After your address list has been imported, Direct Mail Manager runs the
Address Verification step.
<P>
NOTE: If Direct Mail Manager does not verify your address list, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Back button to return to the prompt "Your address list has
   been imported."

<P><LI>Click Options.

<P><LI>On the Optional Steps tab, click to select the Run Address Verification
   check box.

<P><LI>If you want Direct Mail Manager to check your verified addresses for
   duplicates, click to select the Check For Duplicates check box.
<P>
   NOTE: Under Check For Duplicates, you can choose how you want Direct
   Mail Manager to check for duplicate addresses. Select one of the
   following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Identical ZIP Code (all 11 digits)
    - Identical ZIP Code and delivery address
    - Identical ZIP Code, delivery address, and name
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>When you click Next, Direct Mail Manager verifies your address list and
shows you address verification results similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Total number of addresses:                     &lt;number&gt;
   Addresses with verified 9-digit ZIP Codes:     &lt;number&gt;  &lt;percentage&gt;
   Addresses with verified 5-digit ZIP Codes:     &lt;number&gt;  &lt;percentage&gt;
   Not verified or non-USA addresses:             &lt;number&gt;  &lt;percentage&gt;

</PRE></OL>When you click OK, Direct Mail Manager will allow you to edit the address
list results.
