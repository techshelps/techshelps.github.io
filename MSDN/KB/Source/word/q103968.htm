<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains an August 9, 1993, Microsoft press release that
announces and describes Open Database Connectivity (ODBC).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Announces ODBC Desktop Database Drivers Version 1.0;
<P><h3>Delivers Data to Applications from All Major Desktop Databases</h3>
 
<P>
REDMOND, Wash. - Aug. 9, 1993 - Microsoft Corporation today announced
Microsoft(R) Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) Desktop Database Drivers
version 1.0, a set of drivers that provides Microsoft Windows(TM)
operating system-based applications easy access to the most popular
desktop databases and file formats through ODBC.
<P>
Customers can use the ODBC Desktop Database Drivers in conjunction with
ODBC-enabled applications, or develop new applications with the drivers.
The ODBC drivers deliver data to applications from desktop databases and
file formats, including Microsoft Access(R) database management system
versions 1.0 and 1.1, FoxPro(R) database management system versions 2.0
and 2.5, Microsoft Excel 3.0 and 4.0, Btrieve(R) 5.1, dBASE III(R),
dBASE IV(R), Paradox(R) 3.0 and 3.5 and formatted text files.
<P>
"Customers now have a single, convenient set of drivers to access the
most popular desktop databases using ODBC," said Kyle Geiger, ODBC
general manager at Microsoft. "Users can work with a variety of desktop
databases in a consistent manner from within any ODBC-enabled
application. The ODBC Desktop Database Drivers will make it easier for
corporate developers and ISVs to deliver an exciting array of
ODBC-enabled applications on the Windows operating system. Microsoft
ODBC provides broad, open data access, whether that data resides on a
large corporate database or on a desktop DBMS. This set of drivers adds
to the growing list of 20- plus drivers available."
<P>
<P><h3>ODBC Drivers Make it Easy to Deliver Data to Applications</h3>
 
<P>
ODBC Desktop Database Drivers version 1.0 makes it easy for independent
software vendors (ISVs), solution providers and corporate developers to
provide applications that access a variety of desktop databases using
ODBC. Microsoft is making the drivers available for commercial
redistribution, so that software vendors can easily provide broad
database compatibility to their customers, simply by shipping the ODBC
Desktop Database Drivers with their applications.
<P>
Each driver in the ODBC Desktop Database Drivers includes an extensive
help file that provides detailed information about what functionality is
available to the developer.
<P>
Using the ODBC Desktop Database Drivers, ISVs and Solution Providers
(system integrators, value-added resellers, consultants, training
organizations and other businesses that create line-of- business
computing solutions using Microsoft products) can more easily create and
offer a single application version that supports all popular desktop
databases, enabling vendors to provide a more flexible application
solution to their customers.
<P>
"Powersoft is committed to providing access to a variety of desktop data
sources from its Enterprise Series of products [PowerBuilder, PowerMaker
and PowerViewer]," said Bill Critch, director of business and alliance
programs for Powersoft Corporation. "To deliver on this commitment, we
have adopted ODBC as our primary database interface. The availability of
the Microsoft drivers will enhance our efforts to provide corporate and
commercial developers with the seamless point-and-click techniques that
the industry has come to expect with PowerBuilder."
<P>
"From the start, ObjectView supported ODBC to ensure maximum flexibility
in visually developing client-server applications that access multiple
databases across an organization," said Donald P. Addington, president
and chief operating officer of KnowledgeWare. "For expanded access and
convenience, KnowledgeWare will begin shipping the newly available ODBC
Desktop Database Drivers as an integral part of every copy of
ObjectView."
<P>
Corporate developers gain the same advantages from the ODBC drivers, by
incorporating them into their internally developed applications, or
extending the database compatibility of ODBC-enabled commercial
applications. Users benefit by having support out of the box for their
choice of desktop databases, and can easily access multiple databases
from within a single application.
<P>
"ODBC is an important component of our strategy with Windows," said Tom
Connors, group technical staff of Texas Instruments Incorporated. "It is
the glue that binds together proprietary data resources and
Windows-based applications into open, interoperable systems. ODBC allows
suppliers of database technologies to open their products to standard
access methods, yet retain their competitive and proprietary advantages.
It also relieves developers from the burden of development to support
divergent data sources, including text files, Btrieve and SQL
databases."
<P>
"The development of a common, open API that will allow various front-end
data access and reporting tools to access different database types is
just what the industry needs," said Salvatore Scipione, manager,
Technology Resource Center of Independence Blue Cross. "Over the years,
we have built many systems with a variety of tools accessing a variety
of unique-to-the-tool databases. The ODBC data drivers and corresponding
tools that support ODBC will now give us the flexibility to migrate
pieces of these older systems or simply add to them rather than perform
a complete conversion to our newer toolset."
<P>
<P><h3>System Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
ODBC Desktop Database Drivers version 1.0 requires Windows 3.0 or
higher; an EGA, VGA or higher display; a hard disk with 3 MB available
disk space and a high-density floppy disk drive. Also required for
software developers are the ODBC SDK version 1.0, the Windows 3.1 SDK
and the Microsoft C 8.0 or compatible compiler. For more information or
to obtain the Microsoft ODBC Software Development Kit, call (800)
227-4679. The Novell(R) WBTRCALL.DLL is required for use with the ODBC
Btrieve driver.
<P>
<P><h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
 
<P>
ODBC Desktop Database Drivers version 1.0 is scheduled to be available
in two to three weeks for a suggested retail price of $49. Licenses for
commercial and non-commercial (corporate internal) redistribution are
available.
<P>
<P><h3>More on ODBC</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft ODBC is the database component of the Windows Open Services
Architecture (WOSA). WOSA provides Microsoft applications, customers and
ISVs with standard interfaces for access to a wide variety of services
such as mail, databases and networking communications.
<P>
