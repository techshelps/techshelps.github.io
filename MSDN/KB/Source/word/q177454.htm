<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft does not supply a converter for Adobe PageMaker publications.
The methods described in this article provide customers with background
information of how they might export PageMaker publications to a form that
can be read by Microsoft Word. Customers should be referred to Adobe
PageMaker for support of how to do this.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Some Background About Adobe PageMaker</h3>
 
<P>
PageMaker publications contain both text and graphic objects. Graphic
objects in PageMaker behave analogously to frames in Word and appear with
similar small square "handles" on the edges and corners of the object.
These can be "floating" or in-line, held in the text stream. Text objects,
called "stories," behave analogously to Text Boxes in Word. Stories can
stand alone on a page or be "threaded" from one area of a page to another
or across pages. When selected, a text block appears similar to this:
<P>
<PRE> #___________________________________()___________________________________#
   Microsoft does not supply a converter for Adobe PageMaker publications.
   The following method can be used to export PageMaker publications to a
   form that can be read by Word.
 #________________________________________________________________________#
                                     ()
</PRE>where () represents the small semi-circular "windowshade" handles for the
top and bottom of the story box and # represents the selecting handles for
the text block itself. In a threaded story, the top center handle will
contain a plus (+) sign, indicating that the text block is contiguous with
a text stream appearing previously in the publication. You might also see a
red downward-pointing triangle in the bottom windowshade handle, indicating
that the text continues beyond the bottom edge of the text block.
<P>
PageMaker does not see text blocks that appear sequentially on a page as in
any way contiguous. It is therefore not possible in versions of PageMaker
earlier than 6.5 to export all stories in a PageMaker publication to a
single file. Each story must be exported and saved as a separate file.
<P>
<P><h3>To Export a PageMaker Story</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select the text block, and on the Edit menu, click Edit Story.
<P>
   You will see the text in a screen that looks very similar to Word's
   Normal View with the Style Area displayed.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Export, and then click Text.
<P>
   You will get a dialog box proposing a file name and folder, plus the
   options in Save As Type box for Text or Rich Text Format. To retain the
   formatting in the text block, select Rich Text Format. PageMaker's RTF
   export is quite good and Word will read the majority of the text
   formatting effects created in PageMaker. Export each story this way, and
   then these files can be opened in Word by one of the following ways:
<P>
   On the File menu, click Open.
<P>
   -or-
<P>
   On the Insert menu, click File, select the PageMaker file, and then
   click OK.
<P>
</OL>Adobe PageMaker, version 6.5, can export a publication to a single HTML
file by clicking Export on the File menu. Each text block and graphic will
be placed in a cell in a full-page HTML table, in an attempt to duplicate
the layout of the PageMaker publication. This HTML file may be opened and
edited in Word, but the result may require considerable touchup.
<P>
In PageMaker version 6.5, the graphic images can be exported as stand-alone
TIFF or JPEG files. In all versions of PageMaker, they can be copied to the
destination application on the Windows Clipboard, which is often a better
option. Graphic objects created in PageMaker, such as lines, circles and
boxes, are proprietary to PageMaker and cannot be exported as graphics or
transported to other applications via the Clipboard.

make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
