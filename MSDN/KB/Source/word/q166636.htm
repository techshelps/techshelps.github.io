      TITLE: WD97: Outlook/WordMail Tries to Use Word Viewer as Editor

7. Q. I installed Microsoft Word Viewer 97 and now WordMail isn't working.
      What is happening?

   A. Microsoft Outlook is trying to launch Microsoft Word Viewer 97
      instead of Microsoft Word as the e-mail editor. For more information,
      please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q166050.htm">Q166050</A></B>

9. Q. Where is the toolbar in Microsoft Word Viewer 97?

   A. Microsoft Word Viewer 97 does not have a toolbar. Adding toolbar
      support to Word Viewer would have made the program significantly
      larger and would have slowed down the program boot time. In order to
      make Microsoft Word Viewer 97 as small and as fast as possible,
      toolbar support was removed.

10. Q. Why do I get a message about margins set outside the printable
       region when I print a document?

    A. When the document was created in Microsoft Word, one or more of the
       margins was set smaller than what your current printer can print.
       For more information, please see the following article in the
       Microsoft Knowledge Base:

       ARTICLE ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q166055.htm">Q166055</A></B>

11. Q. How do I restore Microsoft Word as the default .doc application
       after I make Microsoft Word Viewer 97 the default .doc application?
