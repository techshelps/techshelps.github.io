The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert a Microsoft Word Document object into a Microsoft
PowerPoint slide, you will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The server application, source file, or item can't be found. You should
   reinstall the server application.

</PRE>When you click OK and hide PowerPoint, you will see the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot load the Microsoft Office 98 Shared libraries. There may
   not be enough free memory to load the libraries or files may have been
   moved from their originally installed locations.

   Try the following:

   - In the Memory Control Panel, make sure Virtual Memory is turned on.
     If you turn it on, restart your computer.

   - Move the Word back to the Microsoft Office 98 folder.

   - Reinstall Word using the installer program provided with the software
     to make sure all files needed to run Word are installed correctly.

</PRE>Clicking OK closes the dialog box. This may, however, leave Microsoft Word
open with a blank document.
<P>
NOTE: The default installation location is the Microsoft Office 98 folder;
this may be different if you changed the default location of Word.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Either Virtual Memory has been turned off or the Microsoft Word Program
file has been removed from the default location of the Microsoft Office 98
folder.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, make sure that the virtual memory setting is
on and that the Microsoft Word Program file is in the appropriate location.
<P>
<P><h3>Ensuring That the Virtual Memory Setting Is Turned On</h3>
 
<P>
To make sure that the Virtual Memory setting is turned on, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Close all programs.

<P><LI>Click the Apple icon, point to Control Panels, and then click Memory.

<P><LI>Under Virtual Memory, make sure On is selected. If it is not, turn it on
   and then close the Memory control panel.

<P><LI>On the Special menu, click Restart.
<P>
</OL><h3>Verifying the Location of the Microsoft Word Program File</h3>
 
<P>
Make sure that the Microsoft Word Program file is in the folder to which
the program was first installed.
<P>
To find the Microsoft Word Program file, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In the Macintosh finder, on the File menu, click Find.

<P><LI>Set Find Items to your Macintosh HD.

<P><LI>In the input box beside name contains, type Microsoft Word and then
   click Find.

<P><LI>On the results screen, under Kind, look for Application Program with
   the name "Microsoft Word," select it, and identify its location.
<P>
</OL>If this file is not location where you first installed Word, then move it
to that folder. The default folder for installation is Microsoft Office 98.
<P>
If the file cannot be found, or if the steps above did not work, then
reinstall Word.
<P>
