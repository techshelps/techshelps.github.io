The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Power Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
<LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to start the Power Macintosh version of Word after starting
from the System compact disc or Disk Tools disk, one of the following
occurs:

<UL><LI>Word begins to start, and it then quits suddenly before the splash
   screen appears. There are no error messages. More specifically, the
   animated rectangles (commonly referred to as "zoom rects") zoom outward
   and then immediately zoom back in.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Word produces one of the following two error messages:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The application "Microsoft Word" could not be opened because
      "Microsoft_OLE2" could not be found.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The application "Microsoft Word" could not be opened because
      "MicrosoftDialogLib" could not be found.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior may be caused by general system problems. For additional
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122195.htm">Q122195</A></B>
   TITLE     : Troubleshooting Macintosh System Errors That Occur in
               MacWord

</PRE>If you have ruled out the possibilities described in <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122195.htm">Q122195</A></B>, the problem
may be caused by one of the following.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: The OLE Files Are Missing from the Path</h3>
 
<P>
When Word for the Power Macintosh starts, it looks for OLE files in the
Extensions folder of the active System Folder. Since you did not start the
computer with the same System that was running when you installed Word, 
these files are missing and Word cannot start. This situation does not 
apply to the 68K version of Word because this version of Word can start 
without OLE.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2: Insufficient Memory</h3>
 
<P>
On a Power Macintosh with only 8 megabytes (MB) of memory, virtual memory
must be turned on in order to run Word. Because the Memory Control Panel is
not present in the System Folder of the Macintosh System compact disc, Word
cannot start.
<P>
Due to the new memory model, applications optimized for the Power Macintosh
(such as Word) take up more memory when virtual memory is disabled. This is 
because when virtual memory is active, the system automatically loads some 
components which it normally loads only on demand.
<P>
IMPORTANT NOTE: Since you cannot run Word on a Power Macintosh with only 8
MB of memory after booting from the System CD, we recommend that you make 
clean system installation for testing purposes. To do this, press 
COMMAND+SHIFT+K in the System 7.5 Installation dialog box, and click 
Install New System Folder in the dialog box that appears.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q127033.htm">Q127033</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Do a Clean Installation of System 7.5
</PRE><h3>Case 3: Inadequate System Resources</h3>
 
<P>
In most cases, Word for the Power Macintosh will not start if you boot from
a Disk Tools disk, no matter how much built-in memory is available. This
is because the System File on the Disk Tools disk has a minimum set of
resources; the resources necessary to run the Power Macintosh version of
Word are often absent.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To check for a damaged system for Word for the Power Macintosh, follow 
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the following required OLE files from the Extensions Folder to the
   folder containing the Microsoft Word program.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Dialog Library
      Microsoft OLE Library
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This places the files in the search path because Word also 
   searches the program folder. Therefore, Word can start even when a 
   different System is active. Once you are finished troubleshooting, 
   delete the extra OLE files from the program folder so that the files 
   don't take up extra space and don't interfere with the normal search 
   path.

<P><LI>Start (boot) the Power Macintosh using the Macintosh System CD.
<P>
   If you have System CD version 1.0, insert the CD at startup.
<P>
   If you have System CD version 2.0, with the CD inserted in the drive,
   start the computer while holding down the C key on the keyboard.
<P>
   An alternate method of restarting with any Macintosh System CD is
   to place the CD in the CD-ROM drive, choose Restart from the Special
   menu, and press and hold COMMAND+OPTION+SHIFT+DEL while the computer
   restarts. Then, let go of the keys when the Happy Macintosh icon 
   appears; otherwise, if you continue to hold the keys down, the hard 
   drive will not mount and you will need to restart.

<P><LI>Start Word.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If the problem persists with Word after starting the computer this
      way, you can conclude that something is wrong with Word and not with
      the System or Finder file on the hard disk. In this case, you should
      remove and reinstall Word.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If Word behaves normally, you can conclude that your System or
      Finder file on the hard disk is damaged. In this case, you must
      reinstall your Macintosh system software. For assistance, check your
      Apple Macintosh manual, or contact Apple technical support.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: It's always a good idea to back up your hard disk before you
      reinstall the Macintosh system software.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Restarting with a System from an alternate source is a common method for
troubleshooting Word problems.

</PRE></OL>If you are testing a feature that requires OLE functionality (such as
embedding an Equation Editor object, linking to a Microsoft Excel
worksheet, and so on), you may need to copy all of the OLE files to the
program folder. These are the OLE files installed with Word 6.0:
<P>
<PRE>  Microsoft Dialog Library
  Microsoft OLE Extension
  Microsoft OLE Library

</PRE>NOTE: Other Office applications may have installed other OLE files.
