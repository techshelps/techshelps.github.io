The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Add button in the Spelling dialog box (or Spelling shortcut menu, in
Word for Windows 95) is unavailable (dimmed).
<P>
This problem does not occur in Word 97.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Case 1 - The Custom Dictionary check box is not selected.
<P>
Case 2 - The custom dictionary currently being used is read-only or in a
<PRE>         read-only directory.

</PRE>Case 3 - The custom dictionary is set for a different language than the
<PRE>         document.

</PRE>Case 4 - The custom dictionary is currently open.
<P>
Case 5 - The custom dictionary does not exist.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Word for Windows 95, version 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
Case 1 - The Custom Dictionary check box is not selected.
 
<P>
To correct this problem:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.
</OL>2. Click the Spelling tab.
3. Click Custom Dictionaries.
4. Under Custom Dictionaries, select the CUSTOM.DIC check box.
<P>
Case 2 - The custom dictionary currently being used is read-only or in a
<PRE>------   read-only directory.

</PRE></OL>The default name and location of the custom dictionary are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Proof\Custom.dic

</PRE>If the Custom.dic file is read-only or if the Proof subfolder is set to
read-only, you cannot add new words to the custom dictionary. Clear the
read-only attributes for the file and its subfolder.
<P>
Case 3 - The custom dictionary is set for a different language than the
<PRE>------   document.

</PRE>To correct this problem:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.
</OL>2. Click the Spelling tab.
3. Click Custom Dictionaries.
4. On the Language line under Custom Dictionaries, select the language that
<PRE>   the document is set for. The default for this setting is &lt;None&gt;. The
   language of the document is set by selecting the document and clicking
   Language on the Tools menu.

</PRE></OL>Case 4 - The custom dictionary is currently open.
 
<P>
The Custom.dic file might be open for editing. Word does not allow you to
add words to the custom dictionary while it is open. To resolve this issue,
close the Custom.dic file.
<P>
Case 5 - The custom dictionary does not exist.
 
<P>
If the Custom.dic file had been deleted during the session of Word, then
Add would not be available in the Spelling dialog box. Either re-create the
Custom.dic file (saved as a text file) in the proper location or restart
Word. If Word is restarted, it will detect that there is no Custom.dic file
and will prompt you to create one when you attempt to add a word to the
Custom.dic file.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes on the Spelling Checker in Word for Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
Word uses the following procedure to search for the spelling checker:

<OL><P><LI>Word looks for the custom dictionary in the folder indicated in the
   Windows 95 Registry. By default, the folder and filename are
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\proof\Custom.dic
</PRE>
<P><LI>If Word does not find the file there, Word looks in its own program
   folder.

<P><LI>If Word does not find the CUSTOM.DIC there, Word asks you if you want to
   create a new custom dictionary and states the path where it intends to
   put the file. It asks for the name of the custom dictionary file you
   want to create.
<P>
</OL><h3>Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c</h3>

<P>
<P><h3>Notes on the Spelling Checker in Word 2.x and 6.x</h3>
 
<P>
Word uses the following procedure to search for the spelling checker:

<OL><P><LI>Word looks for the custom dictionary in the folder indicated in the [MS
   Proofing Tools] section of the Win.ini file. By default, the directory
   and filename are C:\Windows\Msapps\Proof\Custom.dic.

<P><LI>If Word does not find the file there, Word looks in its own program
   folder.

<P><LI>If Word does not find the Custom.dic there, Word asks you if you want to
   create a new custom dictionary and states the path where it intends to
   put the file.

<P><LI>Even if you choose the No button when Word asks if you want to create a
   new custom dictionary, Word creates one anyway.

<P><LI>If the path where Word intends to create Custom.dic is not valid, Word
   places the new Custom.dic file in the Word program folder.
