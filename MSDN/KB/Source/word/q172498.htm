<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The EditConversionOptions macro enables you to set text and graphic
converter filter options from within Microsoft Word. Once the option is set
by using this macro, the saving and/or opening of a foreign file format,
such as a Text with Layout, in Microsoft Word will use a file called
MSTXTCNV.INI in the Windows folder. The EditConversionOptions macro is
found in a template that ships with Microsoft Word. For information about
how to access this macro, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  - RFT-DCA

               AbsLineSpacing=No       Single line spacing differs in Word
                                       and RFT-DCA formats. In RFT-DCA
                                       format, single line spacing
                                       specifies a line density of 6 lines
                                       per inch. In Word, single line
                                       spacing sets spacing to accommodate
                                       the tallest character in each line.
                                       Choose "Yes" to emulate RFT-DCA line
                                       spacing as closely as possible by
                                       converting to Exact line spacing in
                                       Word. Leave setting as "No" to
                                       convert line spacing as single.


               StrikeThrough          Type the character to be used to
                                      emulate the strikethrough format of
                                      Word when saving as RFT-DCA format.
                                      Any ANSI character greater than 33
                                      and less than 127 can be used. The
                                      default setting is the ANSI hyphen
                                      character.

               Tab=DecimalTab         Enter "CommaTab" to convert Word
                                      decimal tabs to comma tabs when
                                      saving as RFT-DCA format. Leave
                                      setting as "DecimalTab" to convert
                                      decimal tab to RFT-DCA decimal tabs.

               TranslateBeta=German   Enter "Greek" to translate the ANSI
                                      Beta character to the Greek Beta
                                      character when saving as RFT-DCA
                                      format. Leave setting as "German" to
                                      translate the Beta character to the
                                      German ess-set character.


               Variant=DW4Z           Enter "5520" to write special RFT-DCA
                                      constructs if you are saving to
                                      RFT-DCA format for use in a 5520
                                      environment. Leave as "DW4Z" if you
                                      do not plan to use the RFT-DCA file
                                      in a 5520 environment.

  - Text with Layout

               CharMaps=a,a           Enter a Word character followed by a
                                      comma and the character you want to
                                      map this Word character to when
                                      saving as Text with Layout. Multiple
                                      mappings are separated by a
                                      semicolon. For example, a, b, and c
                                      can be mapped to A, B, and C by
                                      specifying "a,A;b,B;c,C". The neutral
                                      default setting of "a,a" is provided
                                      as a syntax example.

               Width=80               Enter a value between 1 and 80
                                      characters to specify the absolute
                                      maximum number of characters that can
                                      appear on one line when saving as
                                      Text with Layout. Specifying a lesser
                                      value allows full lines to be
                                      displayed on screens which display
                                      fewer than 80 characters per line. If
                                      the formatting in your Word document
                                      allows fewer characters per line,
                                      document formatting takes precedence
                                      over this setting.

               PointSize=24           Enter a point size to control the
                                      number of characters that fit per
                                      line. Specifying a value less than
                                      12 allows more characters to fit on
                                      each line, and can be used to prevent
                                      premature line wrapping in a text
                                      file.

  - Word for MS-DOS 3.0-6.0

               ConvertMerge=Yes       Choose "No" to convert Word for
                                      MS-DOS chevron characters (ASCII 174
                                      and 175) as normal text. Leave
                                      setting as "Yes" to recognize sets of
                                      left and right chevron characters as
                                      merge field delimiters and to convert
                                      them to Word for Windows as mail
                                      merge fields.

               MWINI=No               Enter the full path to the directory
                                      location of the Word for MS-DOS
                                      MW.INI initialization file to use the
                                      variable settings contained in this
                                      file (for example, default language,
                                      tab-steps, and margins) for
                                      conversion. This file is not required
                                      for conversion. Leave setting as "No"
                                      if you do not want to use this file
                                      during conversion.

               MirrorOriginal=No      Choose "Yes" to optimize visual
                                      fidelity at the possible expense of
                                      editability when converting a Word
                                      for MS-DOS document to Word for
                                      Windows. Leave setting as "No" to
                                      optimize conversion for editability.

               NewSectForHdrFtr=Yes   Word for MS-DOS allows definition of
                                      headers and footers beginning on any
                                      page in a section. Word for Windows
                                      only allows definition of headers and
                                      footers to begin on the first or
                                      second page of a section. Choose "No"
                                      to convert headers and footers as
                                      normal text at the start of a
                                      section. Leave setting as "Yes" to
                                      insert continuous section breaks at
                                      the locations where new headers and
                                      footers are defined.

               PCWordLayout=Yes       Default line spacing and treatment of
                                      superscript/subscript text relative
                                      to line spacing in Word for Windows
                                      differs from that applied in Word for
                                      MS-DOS. Choose "No" to convert
                                      document so that it reflects Word for
                                      Windows look and feel as closely as
                                      possible. Leave setting as "Yes" to
                                      emulate the original Word for MS-DOS
                                      line spacing layout as closely as
                                      possible.

               StyleDialog=Yes        Choose "No" to retain all Word for
                                      MS-DOS style information as direct
                                      formatting when converting to Word
                                      for Windows. Leave setting as "Yes"
                                      to display a dialog box during
                                      conversion that prompts for the
                                      location of a style sheet when the
                                      style sheet originally attached to
                                      the Word for MS-DOS document cannot
                                      be found.

               TabsInHangInd=Yes      Choose "No" to convert Word for
                                      MS-DOS paragraphs with hanging
                                      indents literally when converting to
                                      Word for Windows. Leave setting as
                                      "Yes" to modify tabs in hanging
                                      indents to more accurately reflect
                                      original Word for MS-DOS layout.
