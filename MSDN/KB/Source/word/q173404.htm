<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes what cross-references are, how to create them, how
to edit them, how to update them. It also describes how cross-references 
are enhanced in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows and Word 98 Macintosh 
Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>What Is a Cross-reference?</h3>
 
<P>
The cross-reference feature in Word allows you to create a cross-reference
that refers to an item in either the same document or a different document,
for example, "See Table 6 on page 22." If the item in the cross-reference
changes, for example, if Table 6 becomes Table 5, or Table 6 moves to page
23, you can update the cross-reference field without retyping it.
<P>
<P><h3>What You See in the Cross-reference Dialog Box</h3>
 
<P>
This section defines the items that you see when you click Cross-reference
on the Insert menu.
<P>
Reference Type:
<P>
The Reference Type list lets you select the type of item you want to cross-
reference. Word allows you to cross-reference the following items:
<P>
<PRE>   Item                    Description
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Numbered Item           For Microsoft Word 97 for Windows and Word 98
                           Macintosh Edition: if your document
                           contains numbered paragraphs (numbered headings
                           or list items), as in a legal document that
                           contains outline numbered list items or ListNum
                           fields, you can create a cross-reference
                           to the paragraph number.

   Heading                 Text that is formatted with one of the nine
                           heading styles that come with Word.

   Bookmark                Text that is marked by using the Bookmark
                           command on the Edit menu.

   Footnote                Footnote reference marks inserted in a document
                           by using the Footnote command on the Insert
                           menu.

   Endnote                 Endnote reference marks inserted in a document
                           by using the Footnote command on the Insert
                           menu.

   Figure/Table/Equation   A caption inserted with one of the preceding
                           labels by using the Caption command on the
                           Insert menu.

</PRE>Insert Reference To:
<P>
The Insert Reference To list lets you identify the information you want to
appear in the cross-reference. These choices depend on your selection in
the Reference Type list. All of the possible choices are listed below.
<P>
<PRE>   Item                    Description
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Heading Text            Inserts the text of the heading.

   Heading Number          Inserts the number of the heading.

   Page Number             Inserts the number of the page containing the
                           item.

                           NOTE: For footnotes and endnotes, the page
                           number that appears in the cross-reference is
                           the location of the footnote or endnote text,
                           not the location of the note reference mark.

   Paragraph Number        Inserts the paragraph number of a bookmark.
                           See the "More About Paragraph Number" section
                           later in this Article for more details.

                           Equations, Figures, and Tables.

   Only Label And Number   Inserts only the label and number of a caption,
                           for example, Table 1. Applies only to Equations,
                           Figures, and Tables.

   Only Caption Text       Inserts only the additional text you have added
                           to a caption, for example, International Air
                           Distances. Applies only to Equations, Figures,
                           and Tables.

   Above/Below             Inserts the words Above or Below as appropriate,
                           for example, See Table: Above.

</PRE>Insert As Hyperlink (Word 97 and Word 98):
<P>
If you select this check box, Word creates a cross-reference that is a
hyperlink. That is, if you click the cross-reference, Word scrolls to the
referenced item in the document. You can also use the navigation buttons on
the Web toolbar to move between related paragraphs.
<P>
For Which &lt;Reference Type&gt;:
<P>
This area lets you select the specific item you want to refer to. For
example, if you select Footnote in the Reference Type box, this area is
called "For which footnote," and displays all of the footnotes in the
document.
<P>
Insert:
<P>
Inserts the cross-reference at the insertion point in the document. The
cross-reference dialog box remains open so that you can insert additional
cross-references.
<P>
Close:
<P>
Closes the cross-reference dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>More About Paragraph Number (Word 97 and Word 98)</h3>
 
<P>
This section describes the three different types of paragraph number
references you can insert from the Insert Reference To list.
<P>
Paragraph Number:
<P>
Displays the paragraph number and its relative position in an outline
numbered list.
<P>
Example 1:
<P>
A cross-reference in 1.(a)(i) to paragraph 1.(a)(ii) appears as "(ii)"
because both paragraphs are under 1.(a)

<OL><P><LI>Numbered List 1
<P><PRE>      (a) Second Level under Numbered List 1
<PRE></PRE>             (i)  SEE REFERENCE:  (ii)
             (ii) Second Item in Third Level of Numbered List 1

</PRE></OL>Example 2:
<P>
A cross-reference 2.(a)(i) to 1.(a)(i) appears as "1.(a)(i)," because no
context is shared between the paragraphs; that is, they are in completely
different sections.

<OL><P><LI>Numbered List 1
<P><PRE>     (a) Second Level under Numbered List 1
<PRE></PRE>            (i) Third Level, under Numbered List 1
</PRE></OL>2. Numbered List 2
<PRE>     (a) Second Level under Numbered List 2
            (i) SEE REFERENCE:  1.(a)(i)

</PRE>Paragraph Number (No Context):
<P>
Displays the paragraph number without its relative position in the
outline numbered list.
<P>
For example, a cross-reference in Paragraph 2.(a)(i) to paragraph 1.(a)(ii)
appears as "(ii)", regardless of the context of the reference.

<OL><P><LI>Numbered List 1
<P><PRE>      (a) Second Level under Numbered List 1
<PRE></PRE>             (i)  Third Level, under Numbered List 1
             (ii) Third Level, under Numbered List 1
</PRE></OL>2. Numbered List 2
<PRE>      (a) Second Level under Numbered List 2
             (i) SEE REFERENCE:  (ii)

</PRE>Paragraph Number (Full Context):
<P>
Displays the complete paragraph number from anywhere in the document.
<P>
For example, a cross-reference from anywhere in a document to paragraph
1.(a)(ii) appears as "1.(a)(ii)" in the cross-reference.

<OL><P><LI>Numbered List 1
<P><PRE>      (a) Second Level under Numbered List 1
<PRE></PRE>             (i)  SEE REFERENCE:  1.(a)(ii)
             (ii) Second Item in Third Level of Numbered List 1

</PRE></OL>NOTE:  This is similar to what WordPerfect versions 6.1 and earlier use.

<P><h3>How to Create a Cross-reference in the Same Document</h3>
 
<P>
If the item you want to refer to is located in the current document, follow
these steps.
<P>
NOTE: For this example, your document must contain at least one of the
following: a table with a caption, a footnote, an endnote, an equation with
a caption, a bookmark, a figure with a caption, or a paragraph formatted
with a heading or a numbering style.

<OL><P><LI>In the document, type the introductory text that begins the
   cross-reference. For example, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      For more information, see:

   and the document has six headings, click the heading that you want to
   refer to.

<P><LI>Click Insert and then click Close.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you see an entry that looks something like {REF _Ref249586 \*
MERGEFORMAT} instead of text, Word is displaying field codes instead of
field results. To see the field results, press CTRL+F9.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Create a Cross-reference to Another Document</h3>
 
<P>
If the item you want to refer to is located in another document, follow
these steps.
