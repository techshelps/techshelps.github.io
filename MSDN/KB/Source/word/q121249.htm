<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 for Windows NT is an adaptation of Word 6.0 for Windows. All of
the new features available in Word 6.0 for Windows NT were added
specifically to take advantage of Windows NT itself, namely:

<UL><LI>32-bit architecture

<LI>Long filename support

<LI>Multithreaded printing

<LI>Registry support
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Word for Windows NT offers the following features over its 16-bit Word for
Windows counterpart:
<P>
<P><h3>32-Bit Architecture</h3>
 
<P>
Word for Windows NT is written to the Win32 API specification and is,
therefore, a full 32-bit application. This has allowed enhancements to Word
for Windows NT's capacity. Support is now available for larger master
documents and macros, for instance.
<P>
<P><h3>Long Filename Support</h3>
 
<P>
Word for Windows NT supports up to 255 characters for document filenames.
All Word dialog boxes that involve filenames, such as File Open, are wider
to accommodate longer filenames as well.
<P>
<P><h3>Multithreaded Printing</h3>
 
<P>
The background printing feature in Word for Windows NT runs as a separate
thread. This makes working on documents and background printing smoother.
<P>
<P><h3>Registry Support</h3>
 
<P>
Word for Windows NT stores all its setting in the Windows NT Registry.
Because of this, multiple configurations of Word can exist on the same
computer for different users. Word will also support user profiles allowing
users to move from one machine to another and continue to use their same
Word configuration.
<P>
