<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article answers the most frequently asked questions regarding easier
document creation and automatic features in Microsoft Word.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. What is AutoText and how do I use it?

    A. AutoText is a feature that allows you to store text or graphics you
      use frequently. For example, you can store a mailing address that
      you use often, a standard contract clause, or a long distribution
      list for memos. Each selection of text or graphics is recorded as an
      AutoText entry and is assigned a unique name. In previous versions
      of Word, AutoText entries were referred to as Glossary entries. To
      use AutoText, follow these steps:

      a. Click where you want to insert the AutoText entry.

      b. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click AutoText.

         -or-

         On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, point to an item on the
         Autotext menu, and then click the AutoText entry you want. For
         example, point to Salutation, and then click Dear Sir or Madam.

      NOTE: To see all AutoText entries based on a style, press and hold
      the SHIFT key while you point to AutoText on the Insert menu.

2. Q. How do I add text that I use frequently to the AutoText menu?

   A. To create an AutoText entry, follow these steps:

      a. Select the text or graphic you want to store as an AutoText
         entry. To store paragraph formatting with the entry, include
         the paragraph mark in the selection.

      b. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click New.

      c. In the Create AutoText dialog box, type a unique name for your
         AutoText entry or accept the default, and then click OK.

      For additional information about adding AutoText to the AutoText
      menu, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
      Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q157843.htm">Q157843</A></B>
      TITLE     : Adding AutoText to the AutoText Menu

3. Q. How do I get Word to display AutoComplete tips for words that
      I use frequently?

   A. To display AutoComplete tips, follow these steps:

      a. Turn AutoComplete on.

         1) On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click
            AutoText.

         2) Click the AutoText tab.

         3) Click to select the "Show AutoComplete tip for AutoText and
            dates" check box, and then click OK.

      b. Create the AutoText entry.

      c. In the document, type the AutoText name.

         When the AutoComplete tip appears, press ENTER to accept the tip.

4. Q. Why don't I get an AutoComplete tip for my new AutoText entry?

   A. The AutoComplete tip does not appear in the following instances:

      - The "Show AutoComplete tip for AutoText and dates" option is
        turned off.

      - The AutoText entry is linked to the Signature style. The
        AutoComplete tip is displayed when you type this AutoText entry at
        the beginning of a paragraph only.

      - The AutoText entry is linked to one of the Letter Wizard styles
        (excluding the Signature style) and you typed it within a
        paragraph. The AutoComplete tip is displayed when you type this
        type of AutoText entry at the beginning of the paragraph only.

      - You did not type enough characters for Word to identify the
        AutoComplete tip. For example, if you have entries called "company
        logo" and "company address," you need to type "company a" (without
        the quotation marks) to display the AutoComplete tip for the
        company address. On the other hand, if you have an AutoText entry
        for London called "Lond," and you do not have other AutoText
        entries that begin with these four characters, all you have to
        type is "Lond" (without the quotation marks) to view the
        AutoComplete tip.

5. Q. How can I replace one or more characters with a special symbol?  For
      example, how do I replace "ss" (without the quotation marks) with
      the section symbol?

   A. To automatically replace one or more characters with a symbol, follow
      these steps:

      a. On the Insert menu, click Symbol.

      b. Click the symbol you want, and then click AutoCorrect.

         The symbol you selected appears in the With box.

      c. In the Replace box, type the characters you want replaced, and
         then click Add.

      d. Click OK.

      e. Click Close.

6. Q. How do I stop Word from automatically making changes to my document
      while I type?

   A. Word uses a feature called AutoFormat As You Type to automatically
      format headings, bulleted and numbered lists, borders, numbers,
      symbols, and so on as you type. Word also uses a feature called
      AutoCorrect to automatically correct common typing, spelling, and
      grammatical errors. This feature can also automatically insert
      text, graphics, and symbols. To turn off some or all of the changes
      that AutoFormat As You Type makes, follow these steps:

      a. On the Tools menu, click AutoCorrect, and then click the
         AutoFormat As You Type tab.

      b. Click to clear any option you do not want to format
         automatically. Click to select any option you do want to format
         automatically. If do not want to use AutoFormat as you type,
         clear all options.

      c. Click OK.

      To turn off AutoCorrect, follow these steps:

      a. On the Tools menu, click AutoCorrect.

      b. On the AutoCorrect tab, click to clear the "Replace text as you
         type" check box.

7. Q. How do I share my AutoCorrect entries with others?

   A. AutoCorrect lists are now shared between Office programs. Any
      changes you make to the AutoCorrect entries and settings while in
      one programs are immediately available to the other programs.
      In addition, Word can store AutoCorrect items consisting of
      formatted text and graphics. The following articles contain
      information on how to share your AutoCorrect entries with other
      users.

      TITLE     : Where AutoCorrect Entries and Settings Are Stored

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q153149.htm">Q153149</A></B>
      TITLE     : Moving Word AutoCorrect Entries from One Computer to
                  Another

8. Q. What is automatic style definition and how does it work?

   A. Automatic style definition is an AutoFormat As You Type option (see
      previous question and answer) that creates new paragraph styles
      based on the manual formatting you apply to your text. You can
      apply these styles in your document to save time and to give your
      documents a consistent "look and feel." To turn on automatic style
      definition, follow these steps:

      a. On the Tools menu, click AutoCorrect, and then click the
         AutoFormat As You Type tab.

      b. Click to select the "Define styles based on your formatting"
         check box.

      c. Click OK.
