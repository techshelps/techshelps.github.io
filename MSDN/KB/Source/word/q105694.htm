The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, verison 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Documents containing numbered or bulleted lists, created by choosing
Bullets And Numbering from the Format menu, will lose their bullets
and/or numbering when the document is saved as Text Only.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word for Windows versions
6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0c and Word for Windows NT version 6.0. This problem was
corrected in Word version 7.0 for Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent the bullets and numbers from being lost, save the document
as Text With Layout. Text With Layout preserves some paragraph
formatting, such as length of lines, tab stops, and spacing between
lines.
<P>
The paragraph format for bullets and/or numbers is also retained.
However, because of the ansi-to-ascii character translation, bullet
characters will appear as a small dots. The resulting bullet can then
be manually formatted for a larger character size to compensate.
<P>
If you need to save the document as Text Only, you can manually type
in the numbers and create the bullets using the Symbol command on the
Insert menu. By manually typing in the numbers and manually inserting
the bullets, the numbers and bullets are retained as character entries
instead of paragraph formats and are thus retained in a document saved
as Text Only.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Saving a document as Text Only strips off all paragraph formatting.
Bullets and numbers applied with the Bullets And Numbering command are
paragraph formats in Word 6.0 and thus are lost when saved as Text
Only.
