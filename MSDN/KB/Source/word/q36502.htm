The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
This article describes the hardware and System software requirements for
Microsoft Word for the Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Version 6.0</h3>
 
<P>
You must have a hard disk to run Word 6.0. To install Word 6.0, you must
have a SuperDrive (Apple's 1.44-megabyte [MB] floppy disk drive), as the
installation floppy disks are high density.
<P>
The requirements for available hard disk space and system memory vary
depending on how you choose to install Word and how many programs you
want to run simultaneously. Listed below are the minimum requirements for
installing and running Word on either a Macintosh or Power Macintosh.
<P>
Macintosh with 68020 or Higher Processor:

<UL><LI>System 7.0 or later.
<LI>At least 5 MB of free hard disk space. To install the complete Word
   package, you need at least 25 MB of free hard disk space.
<LI>At least 4 MB of RAM.
<P>
</UL>Power Macintosh:

<UL><LI>System 7.1 or later.
<LI>At least 8 MB of free hard disk space. To install the complete Word
   package, you need at least 27 MB of free hard disk space.
<LI>At least 8 MB of RAM.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Word 6.0 cannot run on the following Macintosh models: the 128K and
512K Macintosh, Macintosh Plus, Macintosh SE, Macintosh Portable, Macintosh
Classic, and the Apple PowerBook 100.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Versions 5.0 and 5.1</h3>
 
<P>
Realistically, you must have a hard disk to run Word 5.0 and 5.1. The
program alone uses 852 KB of disk space. This is greater than the capacity
of an 800-KB floppy disk and over half the capacity of the newer, high-
density 1.4-MB floppy disk. Furthermore, in addition to the 852 KB program,
most users will want to use the spelling checker, thesaurus, grammar
checker, or many other parts of Word. A typical complete installation of
Word version 5.0 uses 5.4 MB of hard disk space; version 5.1 uses 6.6 MB of
hard disk space.
<P>
Word versions 5.0 and 5.1 cannot run on the following Macintosh models: the
128K Macintosh, the Macintosh Lisa (XL), the unenhanced 512K Macintosh, and
the 512K Enhanced (512KE) Macintosh.
<P>
As of January 1994, Word versions 5.0 and 5.1 are compatible with all of
the following computers, provided that a hard disk is present:

<UL><LI>The released PowerBooks (including the Duo's)
<LI>Macintosh IIs
<LI>Macintosh LCs and Performas
<LI>Macintosh Classics
<LI>Macintosh Quadras (including the new AV models)
<LI>Macintosh Centris (including the new AV models)
<LI>The Macintosh SE, Plus, SE/30, and Portable
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Word 5.0 is compatible with all System versions after 6.0.2, but
System 6.0.4 or later is recommended.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Version 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
Because the Word 4.0 program occupies more than 400 KB of disk space,
either a hard disk or two 800-KB drives are required to use Word. A typical
complete installation of Word version 4.0 uses 703 KB of hard disk space.
Word 4.0 is not compatible with the 128K Macintosh, the Macintosh Lisa
(XL), or the unenhanced 512K Macintosh. As of January 1994, Word 4.0 is
compatible with the following computers:

<UL><LI>Macintoshes 512KE, Plus, SE, Classic, Portable, and PowerBook 100.
<LI>Any Macintosh with a 68020 CPU.
<LI>Any Macintosh with a 68030 CPU.
<LI>Some Macintoshes with 68040 CPUs. (If Word 4.0 can start on a 68040 Mac,
   it starts only with the processor cache off. If Word 4.0 fails to start
   with the cache off, the Macintosh is not compatible with Word 4.0.)
<P>
</UL>NOTE: The term "Macintosh" includes Performas and PowerBooks.
<P>
Word version 4.0 does not include the Macintosh System and Finder. Make
sure to use versions of the System and Finder that are compatible with both
the program and the computer according to the following table:
<P>
<PRE>   Macintosh           Minimum System/Finder versions
   ---------           ------------------------------

   512K Enhanced       3.2/5.3
