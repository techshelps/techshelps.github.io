</PRE>The PaperTemplates products included here are manufactured by
PaperDirect, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or
reliability.
<P>
The following is the text from the PaperTemplates instruction document,
PPDIRECT.DOC:
<P>
<P><h3>PaperTemplates for Word for Windows 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Although these templates were designed to word with Word 2.x,
they should also work with later versions of Word.
<P>
PaperTemplates by PaperDirect are the easiest way to design, lay out,
and print on PaperDirect papers. PaperTemplates are add-on packages
that work along with your desktop publishing, word processing, and
illustration programs and are available for WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS,
WordPerfect 5.1 or 5.2 for Windows, PageMaker 4.0 or later for Windows,
PageMaker 4.0 or later for the Macintosh, Microsoft Word 2.0 or later
for Windows, Microsoft Word 4.0 or later for the Macintosh, Microsoft
Publisher, QuarkXpress 3.1 or later for the Macintosh, Ami Pro 2.0 or
later, and CorelDRAW! A full set of PaperTemplates contains templates
for over 120 of PaperDirect's specialty papers. A complete description
can be found in the accompanying catalog.
<P>
The PaperTemplates are template (.dot) files especially prepared to
help you format and print the paper samples included in the
PaperSampler with your new HP LaserJet 4P printer. These paper samples
were created to take advantage of some of the unique features of your
new printer, and many of them (especially the smaller sized papers) can
only be used with the HP LaserJet 4P.
<P>
Before using your PaperTemplates, install the HP LaserJet 4P Windows
printer driver that shipped with your printer. Follow the directions in
your Windows manual for adding a printer to Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Using PaperTemplates</h3>
 
<P>
The installation process will copy the PaperTemplate .DOT files into
the WINWORD directory on your computer's hard drive.
<P>
To start a PaperTemplate:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose New.

<P><LI>Make sure that Document, not Template, is selected.

<P><LI>In the Use Template box, select the PaperTemplate you want to use.
<P>
   Notice that a description of the selected PaperTemplate appears in
   the Description box at the bottom of the dialog box.

<P><LI>Choose OK.

<P><LI>Follow the on-screen directions to create your document.
<P>
</OL>When you have finished, you can save, edit, print, and preview as you
would any other document in Word for Windows. You can preview your
document after it is completed by using Print Preview.
<P>
<P><h3>Printing</h3>
 
<P>
When you are satisfied with your text and graphics placement, print
your document on a plain sheet of paper to proof your work before
actually using your PaperDirect paper. Always print a single test page
on PaperDirect paper before printing multiple copies.
<P>
Most standard-sized paper can be loaded into the cassette tray in your
HP LaserJet 4P printer. Smaller-sized paper and heavier-weight papers
should be loaded into your printer using the manual feed slot. When
using the manual feed slot, be sure to also choose the flat paper path:
turn the blue dial on the back of your printer to the down position
before printing.
<P>
Paper loaded through the manual feed will print face up. Orient your
sheet so that the narrow end is going into the printer. With a portrait
(tall) document, feed the top of the sheet in first, face up. For a
landscape (wide) document, load the sheet so that the top of the
document is facing left.
<P>
Some PaperDirect papers (the Influence Brochure/Mailer included in the
PaperSampler, for example) need to be printed on both sides of the
sheet. You will have to print one side of your document at a time. From
the File menu, choose Print. In the Pages range, specify "From 1 to 1,"
to print only side 1. After the first side is printed, turn the sheet
over (see the paragraph above for page orientation). From the File
menu, choose Print. In the "Pages" range, specify "From 2 to 2," to
print only side 2.
<P>
Some of PaperDirect's Brochure Mailers (Influence, included with your
PaperSampler) contain a rotary card. There is a separate rotary card
macro (called ROTARY.DOT) included with your PaperTemplates that MUST
be run to complete your document.
<P>
AFTER you have printed your brochures, open the rotary macro in the
usual manner. Choose the brochure for which you want to create a rotary
card. Complete the macro to set up your rotary card, and print on the
first page of your completed brochures. If you neglect this step, the
brochure WILL NOT contain a printed rotary card.
