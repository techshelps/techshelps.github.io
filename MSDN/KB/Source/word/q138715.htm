<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The practice disk that is provided with the first printing of "Microsoft
Word for Windows 95 Step by Step" does not properly set the Winword SBS
Practice folder location in Favorites as it should.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Most of these books contain the following correction notice label located
on the practice disk envelope:
<P>
 
IMPORTANT!
You will not be able to find the practice files on your
computer by following the instructions as they now
appear in this book. Please note the following changes:
<P>
Replace page 24, Step 2 with:
If the Winword SBS Practice folder is not currently
displayed in the Save In box, click in the Save In box
and then from the list that appears, click the C: hard
disk. Next double-click the Winword SBS Practice
folder icon.
<P>
Replace page 30, Step 3 with:
If a folder name other than Winword SBS Practice
appears in the Look In box, click in the Look In box
and then from the list that appears, click the C: hard
disk.
<P>
This information applies to this copy of "Microsoft Word
for Windows 95 Step by Step."
<P>
 
The above correction notice label is all that is necessary to use this
book.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Alternatively, the following steps correct this problem and allow you to
access the practice files as described in the book.
<P>
Add the "Winword SBS Practice" folder to the Favorites folder:

<OL><P><LI>On the Standard toolbar, click the Open button. (See page 30, step 1,
   for additional help with this step.) The Open dialog box appears.

<P><LI>Click the down-arrow attached to the Look In box. From the list of
   available locations, select the C: hard disk.

<P><LI>From the list of available directories now shown, double-click "Winword
   SBS Practice" (without the quotations). This opens the practice
   directory that you will be using for this book.

<P><LI>Click the Add To Favorites button located just to the right of the
   Favorites button. Select "Add 'Winword SBS Practice' to Favorites".

<P><LI>In the file list box, double-click the file named 02Lesson (if you are
   working in Lesson 2 right now), or close the Open dialog box by clicking
   the Close button (the button resembling an X) located in the top-right
   corner of the Open dialog box.
<P>
</OL>Once this set of steps is complete, the Winword SBS Practice folder will be
available when you click the Favorites button. The steps given throughout
the book are now accurate.
