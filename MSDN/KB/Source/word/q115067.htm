6.00 6.00a
WINDOWS
<P>
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you write a letter or perform a mail merge from PowerLeads! version 1.2
using Word for Windows, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Word Err=1041
   This document template does not exist

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Although you can select Word as a word processor option from within
PowerLeads! version 1.2, the error is generated because the PWRWORD6.DOT is
not installed with the PowerLeads! version 1.2 upgrade disk. To select Word
in PowerLeads!, from the Utilities menu, choose Customize and select
Microsoft Word for Windows version 6.0 as the Word Processor,
<P>
PowerLeads! will correctly print merge when used with Word versions 2.x for
Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To merge your database records with Word 6.0 for Windows, you must first
open the PWRWORD2.DOT file in Word, convert it, and save it as
PWRWORD6.DOT. Store this file in the same directory as PowerLeads!. You
will be prompted twice to confirm conversions. Choose OK to confirm both
conversions. During the conversion process you are prompted to specify the
Header Record Delimiters two times although the second instance is to
specify the delimiters for the data file, not the header file. Use a comma
as a field separator and a paragraph symbol as a record delimiter and
choose OK for both dialog boxes.
<P>
While in the Header Record Delimiters dialog boxes, notice that the
previews show the fields separated by commas and that each record ends with
a paragraph return, indicating that these are the selections that you
should make when specifying field delimiters. Selecting tab or one of the
other symbols as a field delimiter causes the header and data fields to be
converted as one long character string, thus causing an Invalid Merge Field
error.
<P>
By default, the header information is stored in a file called PWRFLDS.TXT,
and the data is temporarily stored in a file called DATADOC.TXT.
