<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 6.0.1
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A calculation in Microsoft Word for the Macintosh displays the
wrong number in the lower-left corner of the window.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, check the following possibilities:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure each entire number is selected. When selecting a column
   by holding down OPTION and dragging, you can select portions of the 
   column and portions of a number. If only a portion of the number is 
   selected, only that portion of the number is involved in the 
   calculation.

<P><LI>Be sure the number "1" is not the letter "l", and the number "0" is
   not the letter "O."

<P><LI>See if the symbols for plus (+), minus (-), asterisk (*), or
   slash mark (/) fall within the selection. Word ignores any letters
   or other characters in the selection, but uses these special symbols
   in the calculation for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
   division (respectively).

<P><LI>If there is an underline in the selected area, be sure the underline
   character is being used, and not a line of hyphens (------), which
   would be confused with subtraction symbols.

<P><LI>In Word 5.x and earlier, if a decimal value is expected for an answer, 
   make sure one of the numbers in the calculation has as many decimal 
   places as is desired for the answer to appear in (for example, 1/5 would 
   yield "0", 1/5.00 would yield 0.20).

<P><LI>If a calculation involves division, make sure you use a forward slash 
   mark (/) for a division symbol, not a backslash (\). A backslash would
   be ignored in a calculation (for example, 1\5 would yield "6"
   because the numbers would be added instead of one being divided by
   the other).

<P><LI>If you are using Word 4.0, there is a problem in which the value "-
   1.0" is interpreted as -.9 ("-1.0" is interpreted as "-.99," etc.).
   Keep this in mind when dealing with negative numbers or subtractions
   in calculations.

<P><LI>If an operator is formatted as hidden text and is not visible on the
   screen, the visible numbers default to the addition operation. For
   example, if 2*8 is entered and the "*" is formatted as hidden text,
   selecting "2 8" and pressing COMMAND+= (EQUAL SIGN) results in the
   value 10 (instead of 16, if the "*" was visible).
<P>
   To get the correct calculation, view hidden text by using the 
   appropriate method for your version of Word.
