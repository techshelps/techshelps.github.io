When authoring Web pages in Word, you can use many familiar Word features,
such as spelling and grammar checking, AutoText, and tables. Some features
are customized to make Web authoring easier, such as graphic bullets and
lines. Features that are not supported by HTML are not available for
authoring Web pages. The list below explains which features are changed or
unavailable when you are authoring Web pages.

                                     deleted. For comments, you can format
                                     text with the Comments style.
                                     Comments will not appear in Web

                                     HTML.

Font sizes            See Notes      Fonts are mapped to the closest HTML
                                     size available in the &lt;FONT SIZE&gt;
                                     tag, which ranges from size 1 to 7.
                                     These numbers are not point sizes but
                                     are used as instructions for font
                                     sizes by Web browsers. Word displays
                                     the fonts in sizes ranging from 9
                                     to 36.

                                     are often displayed by Web browsers
                                     as spaces. To control the layout of
                                     your page, use a table.

                                     because margin settings, indents, and
                                     tabs differ in the Web page authoring
                                     environment. You can point to the
                                     gray area at the top of the document
                                     to display the ruler.

                                     image is created. You can use these
                                     graphics on your Web pages, but you
                                     won't be able to update the data they
                                     represent. If you need to later

                                     save a backup copy of your file as a

                                     graphic becomes a GIF image, and you
                                     will not be able to update it using
