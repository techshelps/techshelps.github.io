The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Word for Windows integration features included with Microsoft
Bookshelf 1993 will work correctly with Word 6.0 for Windows. However,
because the Bookshelf 1993 Setup program is designed to work with Word
2.x for Windows only, Setup will not successfully install those
features with Word 6.0.
<P>
The Word and Bookshelf integration features must be manually installed
to function properly.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the following steps to install the Word and Bookshelf integration
features for Word 6.0 for Windows to successfully communicate with
Bookshelf 1993.
<P>
These steps do not install the Online Word User's Guide included with
Bookshelf 1993. This guide is designed exclusively for use with Word
2.x for Windows.
<P>
Note: These steps assume Word 6.0 for Windows is already installed and
functioning normally.

<OL><P><LI>Install Bookshelf 1993 according to its instructions. When given
    the option to install Word 2.0 for Windows Integration, do not.
    This option should not be checked. It will not function correctly
    with Word 6.0 installed.

<P><LI>Copy the following files from the Bookshelf 1993 CD-ROM to the
    directories listed below (where "WINDOWS" is the name of your
    Windows program directory and "WINWORD" is the name of your Word
    6.0 for Windows program directory):
<P>
<PRE>       File to be Copied from          Directory to Copy File to
       \VIEWER\BS93WORD Directory      on Hard Drive
       --------------------------      -------------------------

       BOOKSHLF.INI                    \WINDOWS
       BOOKSHLF.DLL                    \WINDOWS\SYSTEM
       WORDDDE.DAT                     \WINWORD
       DDEAPP.EXE                      \WINWORD

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following text to the [Bookshelf] section of the WIN.INI
    file:
<P>
       Viewerpath=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MVIEWER2
       Bookspath=D:\BOOKS\
       Integration=2
       SendToDlg=1
       HelpFile=C:\WINWORD\WINWORD.HLP
<P>
    If your Windows directory is located somewhere other than
    C:\WINDOWS, modify the path given on the "Viewerpath" line above
    to reflect the correct path.
<P>
    If your CD-ROM drive uses a drive letter other than D:, modify the
    "Bookspath" line above to reflect the correct drive letter.
<P>
    If your Word 6.0 for Windows directory is located somewhere other
    than C:\WINWORD, modify the "HelpFile" line above to reflect the
    correct path.

<P><LI>If Word 2.x for Windows was previously installed, check for the
    existence of the section [Microsoft Word 2.0] in the WIN.INI file.
    If found, make certain a "programdir" line exists specifying the
    correct path to the Word 6.0 for Windows program directory.
<P>
    If Word 2.x for Windows was not previously installed, or if the
    section [Microsoft Word 2.0] cannot be located in the WIN.INI
    file, create a new section with that name and add the following
    line of text to it:
<P>
       programdir=C:\WINWORD
<P>
    If the Word 6.0 for Windows program directory is located in a
    directory other than C:\WINWORD, modify the "programdir" line
    above to reflect the correct path.

<P><LI>Start Word 6.0 for Windows.

<P><LI>Using the Open command from the File menu, open the following
    document template:
<P>
       D:\VIEWER\BS93WORD\BSHELF93.DOT

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save As.

<P><LI>The following must be typed in the File Name box of the Save As window:
<P>
       C:\WINWORD\STARTUP\BSHELF93.DOT
<P>
    If the Word 6.0 for Windows program directory is located in a
    directory other than C:\WINWORD, modify the File Name line above
    to reflect the correct path.
