Word and formatting documents.

<P>
<PRE>   1. Q. What are the shortcut keys I can use to manipulate toolbars and
          toolbar buttons?

       A. To move a toolbar button to a new location on the toolbar or to
          a different toolbar, hold down the COMMAND key and drag the
          toolbar button to the new location.

          To copy a toolbar button to a new location on the toolbar or to
          a different toolbar, hold down the OPTION key and drag the
          toolbar button to the new location.

          To hide or display a toolbar in Word, hold down the CONTROL key
          while you click once on any toolbar button. From the menu that
          appears, choose the toolbar you want to hide or display.

          To remove a button from a toolbar, hold down the COMMAND key
          while you drag the button off the toolbar. This operation is
          similar to dragging a tab off the ruler to remove it.

   2. Q. I know that I need to display a toolbar to customize it, but
          when I choose Toolbars from the View menu, sometimes the toolbar
          is missing from the Toolbars list. How can I display a toolbar
          if it doesn't appear in the View Toolbars dialog box?

       A. Word displays some toolbars only when you use certain features.
          For example, when you switch to outline view, Word displays the
          Outlining toolbar. When you are not in outline view, you cannot
          display the Outlining toolbar, so Word does not include it in
          the View Toolbars dialog box. To modify a view-dependent
          toolbar, switch to a view that displays the toolbar, then
          choose Customize from the Tools menu. For example, to modify
          the Header And Footer toolbar, switch to Header And Footer
          view, then choose Customize from the Tools menu.

   3. Q. How do I insert a tab character in a text form field?

       A. Press CONTROL+TAB or OPTION+TAB.

   4. Q. How can I use the data from my online form as a mail merge data
          source?

       A. After you fill in your online form in Word, save only the
          online form data, then use that file as a mail merge data
          source or append it to an existing data file. Use the following
          three steps to save online form data only:

          1. From the Tools menu, choose Options.

          2. Select the Save tab.

          3. Select the Save Data Only For Forms option (make sure an X
             appears in the box next to the option), and then choose OK.

             NOTE: When you save the online form, Word prompts you for a
             new filename and suggests the current name of the form with a
             .TXT filename extension. Word saves the data in a comma-
             delimited, text-only file and places the contents of each
             form field in quotation marks.

   5. Q. I want to use my online form both as an online form and as a mail
          merge main document. When I perform the mail merge operation,
          Word for the Macintosh beeps and nothing happens. Why?

       A. You cannot use a protected online form as the main document in
          a mail merge operation. When the main document is protected,
          Word disables the Mail Merge command whenever the protected
          document is the active document. This is true even if your
          online form contains unprotected sections. Unless you unprotect
          your online form, you cannot use it as a mail merge main
          document. As a workaround, you can replace the FORM fields with
          FILLIN or ASK fields.

   6. Q. I've made changes in my document, but Word hasn't updated the
          table of contents or index in my document. What's wrong?

       A. Both the table of contents and the index are fields in your
          Word document. You must update the field to show the current
          results. To do this, click anywhere in the table of contents or
          index and then press F9. For a table of contents, Word displays
          the Update Table Of Contents dialog box; to update only the
          page numbers and retain any direct formatting you applied to
          the table of contents, select the Update Page Numbers Only
          option. To completely recompile the table of contents, select
          the Update Entire Table option.

   7. Q. How do I include the total number of pages in my document page
          numbering? For example, I want the page number to read "Page 1
          of 20", where 20 is the total number of pages in the document.

       A. To include the total number of pages when you number the pages
          in your document, insert a NUMPAGES field using the following
          procedure:

          1. From the View menu, choose Header And Footer.

          2. Position the insertion point where you would like the
             current page number to print.

          3. Type "page" (without quotation marks) and then press the
             SPACEBAR.

          4. Choose the Page Numbers button on the Header and Footer
             toolbar to insert the current page number.

          5. Press the SPACEBAR, type "of" (without quotation marks), and
             then press the SPACEBAR again.

          6. From the Insert menu, choose Field.

          7. From the Field Names list, select NumPages, and then choose
             OK. The page numbering in your document should appear
             similar to the following example

                Page 1 of 10

             where 10 is the total number of pages in your document.

             NOTE: As you modify your document, Word adjusts this number
             so it always reflects the current number of pages in your
             document. Because NUMPAGES is a field, Word may not update
             its results until you switch to page layout view or print
             preview, or until you select the field and press F9 to update
             its results.

          For more information about working with fields, refer to
          Chapter 32, "Inserting Information with Fields" in the
          "Microsoft Word User's Guide." For online Help, double-click
          the Help button on the Standard toolbar and then type "field
          codes" (without quotation marks).

   8. Q. Sometimes I change my toolbars, macros, Word commands, or
          AutoText entries, but when I start a new document, all of my
          changes are gone. How can I make these changes show up in all
          my documents?

       A. You stored these modifications in a document template instead
          of in the Normal Document Template. This means your modified
          toolbars, macros, Word commands, and AutoText entries are
          available only when you work in a document based on the
          template in which you stored the modifications. If you want the
          modifications you make to toolbars, macros, AutoText entries,
          or Word commands to be available to all your documents, either
          make these modifications in the Normal Document Template, or
          load the modified document template as a global template. To
          load a template as a global template, use the Templates command
          on the File menu.

          To move macros, AutoText entries, or customized Word commands
          from one template to another, use the Organizer. To open the
          Organizer, choose AutoText from the Edit menu, choose Style
          from the Format menu, or choose Macro from the Tools menu, and
          then choose the Organizer button.

   9. Q. I made a template that I want to use every time I create a new
          Word document. How do I do that?

       A. Use the Templates command on the File menu to load the template
          as a global template. You can then use this template's macros,
          AutoText entries, toolbars, and customized Word commands--as
          well as the items stored in the Normal Document Template--in
          all your documents. Word does not, however, add the styles from
          a global template to your documents. If you want to make the
          styles from a template available to all your new documents, you
          need to move those styles to your Normal Document Template. You
          can use the Organizer to move styles from one template to
          another. To open the Organizer, choose Style from the Format
          menu and then choose the Organizer button.
