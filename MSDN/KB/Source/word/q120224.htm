The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you start Setup and then cancel it before it finishes installing Word
for the Macintosh, Setup does not remove the files it has already installed
on your hard disk.
<P>
This behavior differs from that of Word 5.x for the Macintosh, in which
Setup removes all the files it placed on your hard disk whenever you cancel
Setup prematurely.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By design, Setup does not undo your Word installation when you cancel
Setup. As a result, you can restart Setup to resume your Word installation
where you left off, so you don't need to start over.
<P>
If you cancel Setup, the following message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup is not yet complete. If you cancel setup now, your new
   software will not be installed properly.

</PRE>If you choose the Cancel Setup button, the following message appears to
notify you that only a portion of Word has been installed on your computer:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Word 6.0 Setup was interrupted before your new software
   could be fully installed. You can run Microsoft Word 6.0 Setup again
   in its entirety at a later time to complete the installation.

</PRE><h3>What to Do Before You Run Setup Again</h3>
 
<P>
If you cancel Word Setup and then want to run it again, you should first
check your System:Preferences folder for a Registration Database file. If
Setup did not create this file, you can simply run Setup again to resume
the installation where it left off.
<P>
If Setup created a Registration Database file in your System:Preferences
folder before you canceled the first time, you need to delete the
Registration Database file before you run Setup again. (This ensures that
no partially installed files remain on your hard disk.)
