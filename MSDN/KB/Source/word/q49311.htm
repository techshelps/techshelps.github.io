<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word for the Macintosh versions 5.0 and 4.0 come with two
help files. For version 5.0, they are "Word 5 Help" and "Word 5
Command Help"; for version 4.0, they are "Word Help" and "Word Command
Help."
<P>
"Word 5 Help" and "Word Help" contain information that is displayed
when you choose Help from the Window menu or press COMMAND+? and
select a command from a menu.
<P>
"Word 5 Command Help" and "Word Command Help" contain information that
is displayed when you choose Commands from the Edit menu, select a
command from the list, and choose the Help button.
<P>
These files must be located in one of the following places for Word to
find them automatically:
<P>
<P><h3>Word 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
Word 5.0 stores these files in a folder called Word Commands, which is
where these files should remain. However, they can be placed in the
folder in which Word is located or in the System Folder, but not in
the root directory, which is the hard disk window if a hard disk is
in use, or the startup disk window if a hard disk is not being used.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
These files can be located in in the folder in which Word is located;
in the root directory, which is the hard disk window if a hard disk is
in use, or the startup disk window if a hard disk is not being used;
or in the System Folder.
