The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 6.0.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you insert a voice annotation in Microsoft Word for the Macintosh,
the size of the saved file can increase dramatically. This increase
occurs because the data structure for the sound portion of a voice
annotation, although compressed, is still significantly larger than
even the most complex formatted text.
<P>
There is no automatic way to strip out all voice annotations in a Word
document. If the formatting of the document is not important, you can
save the file in a Text Only format, which deletes all formatting,
linking, and voice annotations.
<P>
To retain all formatting information in the file, you can use the
Replace command to remove the voice annotations. Voice annotations
have a graphic and a link attached to them. If you remove the
graphics, the voice annotations are also removed. Removing the links
is optional.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To remove all voice annotations from a document, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Show Paragraph.
<P>
<P><PRE>    This allows you to see the bookmarks surrounding all voice annotations. 
    They appear as gray brackets.
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Replace.

<P><LI>From the Special pop-up menu for Find What, click Graphic. Leave
   the space for Replace With blank.

<P><LI>Click Find Next until you find a voice annotation.
<P>
<P><PRE>    NOTE: This procedure finds all graphics in a file in addition to all
    voice annotations. You must verify that you have found a voice
    annotation when you use the next step.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click Replace.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you have deleted all voice annotations.
<P>
</OL>You may notice that the bookmarks surround the text that was selected
when the voice annotations were inserted. While these items are
insignificant with respect to the size and layout of the file, you can
use the following steps to delete the bookmarks:

<OL><P><LI>Click inside the bookmark surrounding the voice annotation.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Link Options.

<P><LI>Press the Unlink button.
<P>
</OL>You can also choose Voice Annotation from the View menu to review the
voice annotations; however, this procedure requires that you close the
dialog box, delete the annotation, and choose the command again, for
every voice annotation.
