The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0, 6.0.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
With Word 6.0 for the Macintosh, you cannot print envelopes directly from
the Envelope dialog box to the
<P>
<PRE>   Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4M
   Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4M+
   Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4Si MX
   Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4MV
   Hewlett-Packard LaserJet IIISi
   Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5Si

</PRE>or the envelope feeder on the:
<P>
<PRE>   LaserWriter Pro 600
   LaserWriter Pro 630
   LaserWriter Pro 810
   Lexmark 4039 (using the Laserwriter 8.1.1 driver)

</PRE>NOTE: To locate the Envelope dialog box, choose Envelopes And Labels from
the Tools menu, and select the Envelopes tab.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the Envelope feature uses a standard 8.5-by-11-
inch (U.S. Letter) page to image the envelope. Because it is not an
envelope size, the Envelope Feeder option is not available in the Print
dialog box, and, therefore, the printer does not pull an envelope from the
feeder. The result is that your envelope is printed on a regular piece of
paper.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word version 6.0 for the
Macintosh. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
For Word to print to an envelope feeder on the printers listed above, you
must set up Word as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Configure the LaserJet/LaserWriter printer driver so that the envelope
   feeder is installed. (See "Configuring the Printer Driver" below.)

<P><LI>Establish a special setting in Word to open the Page Setup dialog box
   directly after you choose the Print button (in the Envelope dialog box).
   (See "Setting the Printer Heuristic in Word" below.)

<P><LI>Select an actual envelope size in the Page Setup dialog box. (See
   "Creating and Printing the Envelope" below.)

<P><LI>Select the Envelope Feeder option in the Print dialog box. (See
   "Creating and Printing the Envelope" below.)
<P>
</OL><h3>Configuring the Printer Driver</h3>
 
<P>
The LaserJet 4M, 4M+, 4Si MX, 4MV, and IIISi or the LaserWriter Pro 600,
630, and 810 or the Lexmark 4039 can use any of several different base
printer drivers, but the recommended drivers are:

<UL><LI>The version 8.x HP LaserJet driver (8.1.1 or later preferred)
<LI>The version 8.x Apple LaserWriter driver
<LI>The Adobe PSPrinter driver
<P>
</UL>All three drivers are based on the same core driver, so it doesn't matter
which one you use. However, using any of the following drivers will NOT
work in this scenario:

<UL><LI>The version 2.12 or 2.2 HP LaserJet 4M driver
<LI>The version 2.2 LaserJet 4Si MX driver
<LI>The version 7.x of the LaserWriter driver
<P>
</UL>The driver must be version 8.0 or later of the above drivers, with 8.1.1 or
later preferred.
<P>
To configure the printer driver:

<OL><P><LI>From the Apple menu, choose Chooser.

<P><LI>Locate the printer driver for your LaserJet/LaserWriter and select it.

<P><LI>Select the actual printer in the "Select a &lt;Printer Driver Name&gt;
   Printer" list.

<P><LI>Click Setup.

<P><LI>Click Auto Setup. Click OK.
<P>
   The PPD should be automatically selected for you.
<P>
   NOTE: If you get a warning message that the correct PPD cannot be
   located, make sure that you have the PPD for your printer in the Printer
   Descriptions folder (either in the System folder or in the Extensions
   folder). If you ran HP's standard setup for the driver, these files
   should already be properly installed.
<P>
   Valid PPDs for the HP LaserJet Series 4 Printers (and their
   corresponding models) are:
<P>
<PRE>      PPD                              Model
      --------------------------------------------------------

      HP LaserJet 4Si MX               LaserJet 4Si MX
      HP LaserJet 4Si MX (300 dpi)     LaserJet 4Si MX
      HP LaserJet 4                    LaserJet 4M, 4MV, and 4M+
      HP LaserJet 4 (300 dpi)          LaserJet 4M, 4MV, and 4M+
      HP LaserJet IIISi                LaserJet IIISi v2012.021
      HP LaserJet IIISi                LaserJet IIISi v52.3

</PRE><P><LI>Click Configure.

<P><LI>Click Envelope Feeder and from the list, select Installed. There may be
   other settings in this dialog box. Choose the correct settings for your
   printer. Click OK, and then click OK again.
<P>
   NOTE: If you do not know certain items of your printers configuration,
   the Printer Info button in the Printer Setup dialog may provide the
   information. The dialog will tell you whether or not certain options are
   installed including the types of networks supported and how much memory
   is installed in the printer.

<P><LI>Close the Chooser.
<P>
</OL><h3>Setting the Printer Heuristic in Word</h3>
 
<P>
Word has a setting (called a printer heuristic) that forces the Page Setup
dialog box to appear after you click the Print button in the Envelopes
dialog box. This dialog box allows you to set the paper size to that of an
envelope so that the printer will use the envelope feeder when you send the
print job.
<P>
NOTE: You need set this heuristic only once for your selected printer. You
do not need to set the heuristic each time you print an envelope.
<P>
To set this heuristic:

<OL><P><LI>In Word, choose Macro from the Tools menu.

<P><LI>Type "ToolsAdvancedSettings" (without the quotation marks). Click Run.

<P><LI>In the Advanced Settings dialog box, select your printer from the
   Categories list. (It should be something like LaserJet 8.0 or
   LaserWriter 8.1.1)

<P><LI>Press TAB to select the text in the Option text box. Delete the text (if
   any) and type "Flags" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Press TAB to select the text in the Setting text box. Delete the text
   and type "4" (without the quotation marks). Then, click Set and click
   OK. For the LaserWriter 600 and 630, this setting should be "132".
<P>
   NOTE: In order for envelopes to print correctly on these printers, the
   "132" setting must be used instead of "4".

<P><LI>Quit Word and then restart Word. (The setting is not saved until you
   quit Word.)
<P>
</OL><h3>Creating and Printing the Envelope</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, select Envelopes And Labels.

<P><LI>Select the Envelopes tab.

<P><LI>Type in the Destination and Return Addresses.

<P><LI>Click the Options button, and then select the Printing Options tab.

<P><LI>Click once on the Landscape Left (fourth from the left) icon, make sure
   that the Face Up radio button is selected and the Clockwise Rotation
   checkbox is not checked. Note: For the HP LaserJet 5Si printer only,
   click once on the Landscape Center (fifth from the left) icon.

<P><LI>Select the Envelope Options tab. Under Envelope Size, select Size 10 (4
   1/8 x 9 1/2 in).  If desired, add bar codes and change the font of the
   return and/or destination addresses.  Click OK.

<P><LI>Click Print. The Page Setup dialog box appears.

<P><LI>Set Orientation to Landscape and set Paper Size to Env Comm10. Click OK.
<P>
   The Print dialog box appears.

<P><LI>In the Print dialog box, select Envelope Feeder from the Paper Source
   list. Click Print.
<P>
</OL>The envelope should pull from the Envelope Feeder.
