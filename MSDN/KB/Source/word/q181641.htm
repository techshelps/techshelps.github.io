IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to create an exclude dictionary. An exclude
dictionary contains words that the main dictionary recognizes as being
spelled correctly, but that you want questioned during a spelling check.
Using an exclude dictionary allows you to specify preferred spellings for
certain words.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Creating an Exclude Dictionary</h3>
 
<P>
To create an exclude dictionary, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In a new, blank document, type the words that you want to put in the
   exclude dictionary. After typing each word, press ENTER to make each
   word a separate paragraph, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      center
      theater
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As. Make sure that you save the exclude
   dictionary in the same folder that contains the main dictionary.
<P>
   NOTE: The main dictionary is usually located in the following folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Proof
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If you cannot find the main dictionary, see the "Determining the
   Name and Path of the Main Dictionary" section later in this article.

<P><LI>In the Save File As Type box, select Text Only.

<P><LI>In the File Name box, type a name for the exclude dictionary.
<P>
   The exclude dictionary must have the same name as the main language
   dictionary (the American English dictionary is Mssp2_en.lex) with which
   it is associated. However, it must have the file name extension of .exc.
   The exclude dictionary file name for the American English dictionary
   must be named Mssp2_en.exc.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
   If Word prompts you to confirm that you want to save the file with
   formatting that will not be saved in text format, click Yes, and then
   click Text Only.
<P>
</OL><h3>Determining the Name and Path of the Main Dictionary</h3>
 
<P>
Use the RegOptions macro:
<P>
The name and path of the main dictionary can be found using the RegOptions
macro that is contained in the Support8.dot template.

<OL><P><LI>If Support8.dot is already loaded globally, skip to step 2. Otherwise,
   follow these steps:
<P>
   a. On the Tools menu, click Templates And Add-Ins.
<P>
   b. Click Add to add a global template.
<P>
   c. Locate the Support8.dot file (usually located in the \Program
<P><PRE>      Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Macros folder).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: If the Macros folder does not exist on your computer, the
      macros may not have been installed when you set up Word. If so,
      you need to run Word Setup again and select the Macros option.
</PRE><P>
   d. Select the template and click OK twice.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macros and then click Macro.

<P><LI>Verify that Support8.dot is selected in the Macros In list.

<P><LI>In the Macros list, select the RegOptions macro and then
   click Run.

<P><LI>Select the Word 8.0 Options tab, select Tools-Path in the Option box,
   and look at the path in the Setting box.
<P>
</OL>-or-
<P>
Look in the Windows Registry:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs after you
edit it. For information about how to do this, click Help in Registry
Editor, click the Contents tab, and click to view the "Restoring the
Registry" topic.

<OL><P><LI>To open the registry, click Run on the Start menu, and type "REGEDIT"
   (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Locate and view the following registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Proofing
     Tools\Spelling\1033\Normal
</PRE>
<P><LI>The Normal key contains the value names and value data to
   the Dictionary and Engine files.
<P>
   NOTE: The Dictionary has a .lex file extension.

<P><LI>Close the registry without making any changes.
