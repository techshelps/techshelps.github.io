<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains the list of documented issues in Word 6.0 for the
Macintosh. The list references each issue by the title and identification
number (Q number) of the Microsoft Knowledge Base article that addresses
the problem in detail. In addition, the list includes the first few lines
of the Symptoms or Summary section of each article. For more information
about a specific issue, query on the Q number for the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q117771.htm">Q117771</A></B>    Section Formatting Not Read from Word Settings (5)

</PRE>When you open the Word Settings (5) file in Word 6.0, default settings
made in Word 5.x's Section dialog are not merged.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q118454.htm">Q118454</A></B>    OPTION+TAB Does Not Insert Tab in "Labels and Envelopes"

</PRE>Word for the Macintosh does not insert a tab character in any of the
following dialog boxes when you press OPTION+TAB:

<UL><LI>The Create Label dialog box when you use the Mail Merge command to
   create mailing labels.

<LI>The Tools Envelopes And Labels dialog box, under either the Envelopes
   or Labels tab.
<P>
</UL>By contrast, Word inserts a tab character as expected when you press
OPTION+TAB in a table.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q118632.htm">Q118632</A></B>    Cannot Sort Single-Column Framed Table

</PRE>Word for the Macintosh does not sort items in a single-column, framed
table if only the frame is selected. By contrast, Word correctly sorts
the items in a framed table that contains two or more columns.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q118776.htm">Q118776</A></B>    Customized User Options Location Is Ignored

</PRE>Word ignores the file location you specify for User Options. (To locate
this item, from the Tools menu, choose Options, then choose the File
Locations tab.)
<P>
In addition, you cannot modify the file location by running the
ToolsAdvancedSettings command to override the Word Settings (6) file
location. (To locate this command, choose Macro from the Tools menu.
From the Macros Available In list, select Word Commands.
ToolsAdvancedSettings will appear in the Macro Names list.)
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q118833.htm">Q118833</A></B>    Space Inserted/Lost When Text is Cut/Pasted

</PRE>Certain actions insert or delete a space unexpectedly when Smart Cut And
Paste is activated.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q118836.htm">Q118836</A></B>    Invalid Field Name Can Be Added to Word Data Source

</PRE>When you choose the Manage Fields button on the Database toolbar when
you set up a mail merge data file, Word allows you to enter invalid
field names. These invalid field names are converted to valid field
names. Conversely, Word does not allow you to add invalid field names
when you use the Create Data Source dialog box.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q118844.htm">Q118844</A></B>    Ampersand in Filename Not Included When Filename Added to
           Menu

</PRE>When you add a filename that contains an ampersand to a menu in Word
6.0, the ampersand does not appear. For example, a file named
"Jack&amp;Jill" will appear as "JackJill" on the menu.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q118900.htm">Q118900</A></B>    Space Added Before Number After Pasting to Text

</PRE>When you paste a numbered list as unformatted text (using the Paste
Special command on the Edit menu), a space appears before numbers
greater than 1, but the space does not appear before the first item, as
in the following example:

<OL><P><LI>Apples
 2. Oranges
 3. Bananas
 4. Grapes
<P>
</OL> 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q119027.htm">Q119027</A></B>    Word Saves Normal Document Template in Word Program Folder

</PRE></OL>Word for the Macintosh may save your Normal Document Template on the
desktop instead of in your Templates folder. This problem occurs if you
move the Word application program to the desktop or to a different
folder from the folder where Word Setup installed it and if you specify
no User Templates setting (to locate this setting, choose Options from
the Tools menu, choose the File Locations tab). When you do this, Word
cannot find your existing Normal Document Template and creates a new one
in the folder where you moved your Word application program.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q119031.htm">Q119031</A></B>    Balloon Help Flashes with Mouse Pointer over Toolbar Buttons

</PRE>In Word for the Macintosh, when Apple System 7 Balloon Help is
activated, the Balloon Help may flash or blink repeatedly until you move
the mouse pointer to another location.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q119078.htm">Q119078</A></B>    Scroll Box Still Moves, Even with Screen Updating Disabled

</PRE>If you turn off screen updating in your Word for the Macintosh macro
using the WordBasic ScreenUpdating statement, the scroll box may still
move along the scroll bar. In other words, the ScreenUpdating statement
does not prevent display changes on the scroll bar.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q119288.htm">Q119288</A></B>    In MacWord 6.0, Name Not Selected in Edit AutoText Dialog Box

</PRE>In Word for the Macintosh, when you select some text and then choose
AutoText from the Edit menu, the text appears in the Name box, but it is
not selected.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q119300.htm">Q119300</A></B>    Clicking in Text Box Doesn't Activate Custom Mark (Footnote)

</PRE>When you choose Footnote from the Insert menu, clicking in the Custom
Mark text box does not activate this option.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q119463.htm">Q119463</A></B>    Symbol Character Pastes as Different Character in
           Find/Replace

</PRE>When you paste a symbol character into the Find or Replace dialog box,
the symbol may appear as a different character from the one you copied.
This behavior occurs when you paste symbols that were created by
choosing Symbol from the Insert menu. If you preview the Clipboard's
contents or paste the symbol to another document, it appears correctly.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q120101.htm">Q120101</A></B>    Cannot Remove or Delete Font After Running MacWord Setup

</PRE>After you run Setup to install Word for the Macintosh, the System may be
unable to delete or remove the fonts you installed. If you try to delete
a font, the following error message may occur:
<P>
<PRE>   An unexpected error of type -39 occurred.

</PRE> 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q120102.htm">Q120102</A></B>    Portions of Help Window Appear on Screen in MacWord Document

</PRE>If Word for the Macintosh online Help is running on top of the other
windows on your desktop, portions of the Help window may appear as
"garbage" in your Word document window. This usually happens after you
close the File Open or File Save As dialog boxes in Word.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q120107.htm">Q120107</A></B>    Word Unexpectedly Quits While Modifying AutoCorrect Entry

</PRE>When you add or modify an AutoCorrect entry, Word for the Macintosh
unexpectedly quits (in other words, the application closes).
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q120232.htm">Q120232</A></B>    Word Unexpectedly Quits While Modifying Font Name

</PRE>When you modify a font name, Word for the Macintosh unexpectedly quits
(that is, the application closes) or hangs (stop responding).
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q120234.htm">Q120234</A></B>    Tall Adjusted and 50-Percent Reduction Not Available in Word

</PRE>When you use the ImageWriter driver, the Tall Adjusted and 50% Reduction
options are not available (are dimmed) in the Special Effects section of
the Page Setup dialog box.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q120235.htm">Q120235</A></B>    Changing to Landscape Orientation Causes Short Pause

</PRE>In Word 6.0 for the Macintosh, changing to landscape orientation in the
Page Setup dialog box may cause a short pause to occur before you get
control back (that is, get a blinking cursor).
<P>
This pause can also occur when you open a document that has a section in
landscape orientation. Also, the pause can become longer and is directly
proportional to the number of fonts you have installed on your machine.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q120352.htm">Q120352</A></B>    Word Doesn't Print in Best Quality from ImageWriter

</PRE>When you print in Best Quality from an Apple ImageWriter from Word 6.0
for the Macintosh, the resulting output will actually be that of the
Faster mode.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q120786.htm">Q120786</A></B>    Insertion Point Positions Left of Inserted Fields

</PRE>When you insert one of the following fields into your Word document, the
insertion point will be incorrectly positioned to the left of the field:
<P>
<PRE>   =          IF             MERGEFIELD     SET
   ASK        INCLUDETEXT    NOTEREF        STYLEREF
   AUTOTEXT   INDEX          PAGEREF        TOA
   COMPARE    INFO           REF
   DATABASE   LINK           SEQ

</PRE> 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q120879</A></B>    Help for Fields Incorrectly Displays Word Help Contents

</PRE>When you use the Help key (F1) to access context-sensitive help for the
following inserted fields, the Word Help Contents screen is displayed
instead of the context help screen:
<P>
<PRE>   PRIVATE        TC
   RD             XE
   TA

</PRE> 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q121239.htm">Q121239</A></B>    Edit Replace Menu Is Missing Hot-Key Accelerator Underlines

</PRE>When you choose Replace from the Edit menu in Microsoft Word for the
Macintosh and try to use the hot-key underline accelerators, some of
these designators are missing.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q121699.htm">Q121699</A></B>    MS Excel Worksheet Data Source Saves as MacWord Document

</PRE>If you use a Microsoft Excel worksheet as a mail merge data source, Word
saves the worksheet in Word document format if you choose Yes when Word
prompts you to save the data source. In other words, Word overwrites the
Microsoft Excel worksheet with a Word document if you choose Yes in
response to the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Document Name&gt; is a mail merge main document that is attached
   to a data source &lt;Worksheet Name&gt; that has not been saved. Do
   you want to save &lt;Worksheet Name&gt;?

</PRE> 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q121700.htm">Q121700</A></B>    Word Hangs Inserting Caption with Revision Marking Turned On

</PRE>An hourglass pointer may appear and persist, and Word may appear to hang
(stop responding) when you insert a caption if revision marks are turned
on. (To insert a caption, choose Caption from the Insert menu. To turn
on revision marks, choose Revisions from the Tools menu and select the
Mark Revisions While Editing check box.)
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q121702.htm">Q121702</A></B>   Converting MacWord 5.1 Settings File Resets SHIFT+RETURN

</PRE>If you use the instructions in the "Settings Files from Word for the
Macintosh" section on page 219 of "Microsoft Word User's Guide" (Word
for the Macintosh edition, part number WB60460-0794) to convert your
Word 5.1 settings file, Word for the Macintosh incorrectly reassigns the
SHIFT+RETURN. When you press SHIFT+RETURN after merging your Word 5.1
settings file, Word inserts a page break instead of a line break. In
other words, Word assigns SHIFT+ENTER functionality to the SHIFT+RETURN
key combination.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q121711.htm">Q121711</A></B>    Envelopes Print Incorrectly to Some LaserWriters

</PRE>Envelopes may print incorrectly to a LaserWriter Select 300. The line
spacing of the return and destination addresses text may be incorrect;
text may be truncated or overlap. The Manual Feed option does not work
correctly, which causes a regular sheet of paper to be printed.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q121795.htm">Q121795</A></B>    Section Layout Formatting Not Applied Properly

</PRE>In Word 6.0 for the Macintosh, Continuous section breaks can sometimes
become formatted as New Page section breaks. This problem occurs if your
cursor is in a section that is formatted as Continuous and you click OK
to close the Layout tab of the Document Layout dialog box.
<P>
In addition, you may be unable to change the Section Start properties
from New Page to a Continuous Section Start on the Layout tab of the
Document Layout dialog box.
<P>
Another related problem occurs when you apply a different Section Start
property to a particular section--this formatting may also be applied to
the section directly following the intended section.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q121844.htm">Q121844</A></B>    Scrolling is Slow in Some Word for the Macintosh Documents

</PRE>In Word for the Macintosh, it sometimes takes a long time to scroll
through a document. By comparison to Word 5.1a for the Macintosh, it may
take up to twice as long to scroll through a document.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122238.htm">Q122238</A></B>    Printer Won't Pull Envelope from Envelope Feeder w/Word

</PRE>With Word 6.0 for the Macintosh, you cannot print envelopes directly
from the Envelope dialog box to the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJets (4M,
4M+, 4Si MX, 4MV, and IIISi) or the LaserWriter Pro 600 or 630 optional
envelope feeder. (To locate the Envelope dialog box, choose Envelopes
And Labels from the Tools menu, and select the Envelopes tab.)
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122372.htm">Q122372</A></B>    Cannot Paste Framed Graphic from Word into Another Application

another application (such as Microsoft Excel).
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122379.htm">Q122379</A></B>    Error Saving Document: "Network Or File Permission Error..."

</PRE>When you are working over a network and you save a document in Word, the
following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   There has been a network or file permission error.
   The network connection may be lost. &lt;FILENAME.DOC&gt;

</PRE> 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122501.htm">Q122501</A></B>    Word Hangs When Launched with Corrupt Fonts

</PRE>When starting Microsoft Word, you receive a System Error or a Type 1
error and your machine may hang (stop responding).
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122506.htm">Q122506</A></B>    Incomplete Top Paragraph Border Below Indented Paragraph

</PRE>When you apply a box border to two or more paragraphs where the first
paragraph has a left and right indent and the second paragraph has no
indent, the top border over the second paragraph does not display or
print correctly. The indented paragraph has a box border around it.
Multiple paragraphs with the same indentation do not exhibit this
behavior.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122548.htm">Q122548</A></B>    "Cannot Print" Error If LaserWriter 8 Preferences File
</PRE>Missing
<P>
If your LaserWriter 8 Preferences file is deleted or missing when you

Word 6.0, only the 5 key on the numeric keypad works.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122567.htm">Q122567</A></B>    Default Font Not Shown in the Envelopes And Labels Dialog Box

</PRE>When the default font is something other than Times New Roman, the text
in the Envelopes And Labels dialog box under the Labels tab still
displays in Times New Roman.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122684.htm">Q122684</A></B>    MacWord 6.0: Form Field Help Text Disappears After Choosing
           OK

</PRE>In the Form Field Help Text dialog box, under either the Status Bar or
the Help Key tab, Word for the Macintosh does not automatically select
the Type Your Own option when you type something in the Type Your Own
box. The None option remains selected. As a result, any Help text you
type is lost if you choose OK unless you manually select the Type Your
Own option.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122685.htm">Q122685</A></B>    MacWord Graphic Frames Shorter When Displayed in WinWord

</PRE>If you convert a Word for the Macintosh document that contains a graphic
to Word for Windows format, the graphic image may appear slightly
shorter in Word for Windows, both on the screen and when you print it.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122697.htm">Q122697</A></B>    Can't Type in Document After Running Find or Replace Command

</PRE>If you run the Find or Replace commands from the Edit menu and then
close the Edit Find or Edit Replace dialog box, you may be unable to
type in your Word for the Macintosh document. To reactivate the document
window so you can type in it, you must click the mouse in the document
window.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122698.htm">Q122698</A></B>    Reverse Print Order Doesn't Work with HP DeskWriter

</PRE>Word for the Macintosh may fail to print in reverse order to the
Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskWriter, even though you turned on the Reverse
Print Order option in Word. (To locate the Reverse Print Order option,
choose Options from the Tools menu, and select the Print tab.)
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122756.htm">Q122756</A></B>    Bold Underlines Print Thicker on Color Quickdraw Printers

</PRE>Underlining that is also formatted as bold prints thicker than
underlining that is not formatted as bold. This behavior occurs when you
print to a Color Quickdraw printer. By contrast, when you print to a
PostScript printer, the underline thickness will appear the same whether
the bold formatting has been applied or not.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122834.htm">Q122834</A></B>    Duplicate Menu Items Converting Word 5.x Commands to Word 6.0

</PRE>If you open your Word Settings (5) file in Word 6.0 for the Macintosh
and save the settings as a new Word 6.0 template [named Word Settings
(5) Template], some of your Word 6.0 menus may contain duplicate
commands.
<P>
 
<PRE><B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q122843.htm">Q122843</A></B>    MacWord Converts Side-by-Side Paragraphs Break Across Pages

</PRE>When you open a Word 4.0 for the Macintosh document in Word 6.0 for
Windows or Word 6.0 for the Macintosh, font names appear in Word 6.0 as
the text string "Fontxxxx" where "xxxx" is a number. For example, Arial

</PRE>When you use the COMMAND+OPTION+PLUS SIGN key combination to customize
your Word for the Macintosh menus, the mouse pointer changes to a bold
plus sign (+). However, when you move the pointer over a dialog box, the
