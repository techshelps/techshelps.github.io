The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Printing Options dialog box implies that you can choose any envelope
feed position and direction, and that will be how the envelope prints from
the printer. THIS IS NOT WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
<P>
(To locate the Printing Options dialog box, choose Envelopes And Labels
from the Tools menu, select the Envelope tab, choose the Options button,
and then select the Printing Options tab.)
<P>
The following information applies to every printer EXCEPT the Hewlett-
Packard (HP) DeskJet printer, which are covered in a later section.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>How Does the Icon Work?</h3>
 
<P>
When you send an envelope to the printer, Word tells the printer that the
paper is an envelope (such as COM 10) and tells the printer what text to
print and where to print it.
<P>
Most printers are preset to print an envelope a certain way. If the
envelope feed option icon matches the way a printer physically feeds an
envelope, then there is no problem. If the icon does not match, several
incorrect results are possible. The printer may:

<UL><LI>Print the envelope the way the feed option icon tells it to.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Print the envelope the way the hardware tells the printer to print the
   envelope (as if there were no icon, making the icon useless).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Print the envelope in some unpredictable way.
<P>
</UL>The feed option icon is used to correct Word when the printer driver tells
Word the incorrect feed method. This can be due to:

<UL><LI>A broken or incorrect printer driver.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>A printer running an emulation that has a different envelope feed method
   than the printer it is emulating.
<P>
</UL>An example of the second condition is a Panasonic printer running a
LaserJet II emulation. Windows uses a LaserJet II driver that tells Word
that the envelope feeds in the center, which is the feed method that Word
suggests. The Panasonic printer, however, physically feeds the envelope on
the right side.
<P>
If you print an envelope with the feed option icon suggesting a center
feed, almost anything can happen. Word sends commands to feed center, while
the printer hardware tries to override the center feed option because it
internally "knows" how to print an envelope.
<P>
To correctly print the envelope, use the envelope feed option icon. By
choosing the correct feed method option, the commands that Word sends to
the printer match what the printer hardware is trying to do, and the
envelope prints correctly.
<P>
In summary, you can correct Word's automatic feed choice when Word chooses
a method that is different from the physical way the printer feeds
envelopes. Word cannot, however, force the printer to print envelopes any
differently than the hardware is designed to print envelopes.
<P>
<P><h3>What About the Clockwise Rotation Option?</h3>
 
<P>
When printing envelopes in landscape, most printers can only rotate text 90
degrees in one direction (either clockwise or counterclockwise). Word asks
the printer driver which way it can rotate text. ("Do you do landscape by
rotating clockwise 90 degrees from portrait or counterclockwise 90
degrees?") If the driver reports this information correctly (that is, the
printer driver reports the correct way that the printer is capable of
rotating text), then Word arranges the envelope so that the printer can
successfully print the envelope. If the printer driver reports this
information incorrectly, then Word may try to send commands to the printer
that the printer cannot handle. Anything can happen then.
<P>
Again, this may happen if:

<UL><LI>The printer driver reports hardware capabilities incorrectly.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The printer is running an emulation where the printer driver gives Word
   different information then what the printer hardware physically
   supports.
<P>
</UL>In either case, selecting or clearing the Clockwise rotation check box
tells Word the correct feed method so that the printer commands meshes with
the printer hardware.
<P>
<P><h3>What about envelopes that are not COM 10?</h3>
 
<P>
If the printer driver tells Word that the printer can handle a certain size
envelope and the printer really can handle it, then everything happens as
explained in the above section.
<P>
If the driver says the printer can't handle a certain size and the printer
really can't, then Word sends the envelope as an 8.5-by-11-inch letter with
"fudged" margins. Fudged margins are when Word sets up a larger piece of
paper and increases the margins so that the text falls in the correct
position on the smaller piece of paper when printed. In this situation, the
envelope will still print out correctly, since Word can work around the
printer hardware limitations.
<P>
If the printer driver tells Word that the printer can handle a certain size
envelope, but the printer really can't (such as might happen with an
emulation), then the commands that Word sends to the printer might not mesh
with what the printer can actually do. The envelope might come out
incorrectly printed.
<P>
A fairly safe bet is custom envelopes. If you try to print a 5-by-7-inch
envelope, the printer driver will probably tell Word that the printer can't
handle 5-by-7-inch envelopes. You can also be fairly sure that the printer
hardware isn't designed for 5-by-7-inch  envelopes. Word will send the
envelope as an 8.5-by-11-inch sheet with fudged margins. The printer will
print the 8.5-by-11-inch sheet just like Word told it to do.
<P>
Possible Issue: "I have a No-Name printer that does an HP II emulation and
<PRE>                it isn't printing my #12 envelope correctly."

</PRE>Method 1: Format an 8.5-by-11-inch landscape document with fudged margins
<PRE>          and put your envelope information on it. Note: Since this is
          being sent as a letter-size document, the printer's envelope
          feeder will not work, since an envelope feeder will not pull
          letter paper on most printers.

</PRE>Method 2: Create a custom envelope with the #12 dimensions. It will also be
<PRE>          sent as a 8.5-by-11-inch document with fudged margins.

</PRE>Why can't Word have supreme control over the printer?
 
<P>
Word could do that by sending every envelope, regardless of dimensions, as
an 8.5-by-11-inch document with fudged margins. The problem is that most
envelope feeders expect a signal from the software telling it the paper is
a "real" envelope. If we sent every envelope as a letter-size request, none
of the envelope feeders would work, since envelope feeders only feed
envelopes and not letter-size pieces of paper.
<P>
<P><h3>What about the DeskJets?</h3>
 
<P>
The DeskJet 550 and 510 print text in three directions, something that most
printers don't do. The DeskJet prints normal, portrait documents in
portrait. It prints envelopes it recognizes (such as COM 10, DL, and #12)
by rotating clockwise 90 degrees. It rotates envelopes it doesn't know
about counterclockwise 90 degrees.
<P>
To solve the problem of "Who knows which way it will rotate," the DeskJet
has been set up as a special case internally to Word. To print envelopes
reliably with Word 6.0, you must have the 3.1 driver from HP. It is the
driver Word was designed and tested for.
<P>
For more information on how to print envelopes correctly using the
DeskJet printers, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   word6 and deskjet and envelopes

</PRE><h3>Special Exception for PostScript</h3>
 
<P>
You can change the rotation of PostScript envelopes. The PostScript driver
looks at a special WIN.INI entry of the following form:
<P>
<PRE>   [HP LaserJet IIISi PostScript,LPT2]    '(or other PostScript printer)
   LandscapeOrient=270

</PRE>If LandscapeOrient is missing, the default is 90 degrees. Landscape rotates
text either 90 degrees or 270 degrees in the counterclockwise direction.
<P>
THIS WILL ONLY WORK with the Windows 3.1 PostScript driver (PSCRIPT.DRV).
You should find the section in the WIN.INI file that looks like [&lt;Printer
Model&gt;, &lt;Port&gt;] and add this entry.
<P>
If you restart Word and go into the Envelope Options dialog box, you should
notice that the Clockwise rotation box is now selected. If it's not, try
choosing the Reset button in the dialog box. If it's still not selected,
the WIN.INI entry did not get properly set.
<P>

printers, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
