The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In print preview, switching from one zoom level to another and then back to
the original zoom level may not display the same number of pages when you
return to the original zoom level. This behavior occurs when you set your
document's page setup to Mirror Margins.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Word for Windows treats facing pages (mirror margins) as "pairs of pages."
Therefore, selecting Mirror Margins in Page Setup may change how many total
pages Word displays at one time.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Word versions listed
above. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You can gain the most control over the number of displayed pages by
changing the zoom control to a certain percentage. Print preview will
remain at that same zoom no matter what selections you make in Page Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Word displays pages in print preview based on a number of different
criteria. In multipage layout, Word will display pages based on the zoom
control you select or by how many pages you want across and down. However
Word will not display a page at less than 10 percent of that page's
original size. The size of the paper and the orientation of those pages can
also affect how many pages will be displayed. Hardware specific variables
such as display driver and resolution may also impact how many pages are
displayed at one time.
<P>
When you change settings in Page Layout (for example, paper orientation or
Mirror Margins), the number of pages displayed will often change as well.
Word tries to keep what you've selected as the zoom and/or number of pages
consistent as it displays these changes for you. Sometimes, Word will make
a decision to display the change at the same zoom but with a different
number of pages.
<P>
<P><h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
 
<P>
In print preview, if you select 24 percent or 25 percent zoom, you can
display three pages. If you then choose Page Setup from the Format menu and
change the orientation to landscape, you may have only two pages across.
You may also get a second row of pages. Word will attempt to keep the zoom
at 25 percent and display as many pages as possible at that zoom. By
contrast, if you choose multipage view and select 1x3 as the display, then
change the paper orientation, Word will try to keep the view at three pages
across by reducing the zoom percentage.
<P>
When you change to facing pages (mirror margins) while in print preview,
Word still tries to maintain the zoom or multipage view you previously
selected. However, it will treat pages as pairs. This means if you had an
odd number of pages displayed before applying mirror margins, an even
number will now be displayed at that same zoom. If you then use the
magnifier and view a page at 100 percent and then zoom back out again, Word
will attempt to show you the total number of pages you had originally
selected, except now they will be pairs of pages. Sometimes Word cannot
display all those pairs because Word cannot display them at less than 10
percent.
