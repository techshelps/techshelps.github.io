<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to create the effect called "Flush Right" in
WordPerfect. In WordPerfect, the Flush Right command lines up some text
in one line with the left margin, and the rest of the text with the
right margin. The following is an example of this type of formatting:
<P>
<PRE>   Chapter 4                                           Page 72
   text text text text text text text text text text text text
   text text text text text text text text text text text text
   text text text text text text text text text text text text

</PRE>In Word, you can use a right-aligned tab or a two-column table to
accomplish this effect. A two-column table is the fastest way to align
text in this fashion.
<P>
You can set the right-aligned tab manually, or you can create a macro
to set the tab automatically. If you use this type of formatting only
occasionally, or if you are interested in learning more about setting
tabs, read the "Method 2: Set the right-aligned tab manually" section
of this article. If you use this type of formatting frequently, read
the section titled "Method 3: Create a macro to set the tabs
automatically."
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To simulate the effect of the Flush Right command, use any of the
following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Create a Two-Column Table</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Place the insertion point on the blank line where you want the text to
   appear.

<P><LI>On the Table menu, click Insert Table. In the Number of Columns box,
   type "2" (without the quotation marks). In the Number of Rows box, type
   "1" (without the quotation marks). Click OK.
<P>
   The table appears in the document. If you do not see the table, click
   Gridlines on the Table menu.

<P><LI>In the first column, type the text that you want to appear along the
   left margin.

<P><LI>Click the right column. On the Format menu, click Paragraph. On the
   Indents and Spacing Tab select Right on the Alignment drop down list.

<P><LI>Type the text you want to appear along the right edge of the page.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Set a Right-Aligned Tab Manually</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click the Show/Hide button on the Standard toolbar so that paragraph
   marks and spaces are visible.
<P>
   This makes it easier to see the tab mark when you insert it in step 4.

<P><LI>Click the View menu and make sure that Ruler is selected.

<P><LI>Type the text you want to appear along the left margin.

<P><LI>Press the TAB key.
<P>
   A small arrow (tab indicator) appears next to the text.

<P><LI>Move the mouse to the left edge of the ruler. A small black "L" symbol
   is in a small box. Click the box. Each time you click it, a different
   symbol appears. Each symbol represents a different type of tab. Click
   the box until a small backwards "L" appears.

<P><LI>Move the mouse to the place on the ruler where you want the right edge
   of the text to appear. (Hint: it may be easiest to see this if you do
   not click all the way at the right edge of the ruler. Start a little way
   in from the right edge. You can easily drag the tab setting later.)
   Click the mouse.
<P>
   A small backwards "L" appears on the ruler.

<P><LI>Type the text that you want to appear at the right edge.
<P>
</OL>The text is now aligned along the left and right margins.
<P>
When you press ENTER to start a new paragraph, the new
paragraph will have the same tab setting.
<P>
NOTE: On Windows only, if you do not see the same tab setting when you
press ENTER, you have the WordPerfect options turned on. To disable these
options, click Options on the Tools menu, select the General tab, and clear
the Help for WordPerfect Users and the Navigation Keys for WordPerfect
Users check boxes.
<P>
Method 3: Create a Macro to Set the Right-Aligned Tab Automatically
(Word 6.x and 7.0 only)

<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/</A></B>

</PRE></OL>The following a macro automates the steps described in method 2 by creating
a right-aligned tab stop at the right paragraph indent and inserting a tab
character at the insertion point.
<P>
You can assign the macro to a toolbar button, a quick key, or to a menu.
For more information about how to do this, see the "Customizing Menus,"
"Customizing Shortcut Keys," or "Customizing Toolbars" topic in online
Help.
<P>
Before you run this macro, place the insertion point on a line of text that
ends with a paragraph mark or new line character. The macro causes the
insertion point and any text to the right of it to be right aligned.

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Macro.

<P><LI>In the Macros Available In field, select All Active Templates or the
   name of a specific template.

<P><LI>In the Name field, type "FlushRight" (without the quotation marks), and
   click Create.
<P>
</OL>d. Type the following macro (capitalization is not important):
<P>
<PRE>      Sub MAIN
         On Error Goto Bye
         Dim Page As FilePageSetup
         GetCurValues Page
         RightMarg = Val(Page.PageWidth) - (Val(Page.LeftMargin)
            +Val(Page.RightMargin))
         Dim Para As FormatParagraph
         GetCurValues Para
         RTabPos$ = Str$(RightMarg - Val(Para.RightIndent))
         FormatTabs .Position = RTabPos$, .Align = 2, .Set
         Insert Chr$(9)
         Bye:
      End Sub

   Note that the line beginning with "RightMarg =" wraps to a
   second line in this article, but you should not wrap it to
   a second line when you type it in Word, (that is, type
   lines 5 and 6 on one line).

</PRE></OL>e. On the File menu, click Close, and save the changes to the
<PRE>   macro.

</PRE>This macro does not remove or change existing custom tab stops in the
paragraph. Consequently, if there are existing custom tab settings in the
paragraph, the tab character inserted by the macro may only move the
insertion point to the next custom tab stop and not to the right indent.
Press the TAB key until the insertion point is aligned at the right edge of
the paragraph, or clear the existing custom tab stops before running the
macro.
<P>
When you press ENTER to start a new paragraph, the new paragraph will have
the same tab setting as the paragraph above it. (If you do not see the same
tab setting when you press ENTER, you have the WordPerfect options turned
on. To disable these, click Options on the Tools menu, click the General
tab, and clear the Help for WordPerfect Users and the Navigation Keys for
WordPerfect Users check boxes.)
