The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Define and Lookup Reference menu commands are not available in Word 97
after you run Setup to add Microsoft Bookshelf Basics.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word 97 for Windows may not detect the Bsh32.wll when Microsoft
Bookshelf Basics is installed during maintenance mode Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Rename the Office 97 Setup Table File (.stf) (Off97pro.stf) and then
reinstall Microsoft Office 97. The .stf file should be located in the
following folder:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Setup

</PRE>NOTE: When you run the Office 97 Setup, be sure to click the Custom button
when prompted for the type of Setup you want to perform. Then, ensure that
Microsoft Bookshelf Basics is selected.
<P>
WARNING: This modification may not be supported by Microsoft. Microsoft
support engineers will support some modifications to a BACKUP copy of the
.stf file. Note also that while support engineers may help customers
modify specific lines of an .stf, we will not rewrite the entire file in
order to achieve a desired configuration. As a general rule, support is
limited to options that can normally be changed by a user during a standard
installation of the application.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Bsh32.wll is the file that gives Word the ability to function seamlessly
with Microsoft Bookshelf Basics by adding the Define and Lookup Reference
menu commands. It is and is located in the "\Program Files\Microsoft
Office\Office" folder.
<P>
Define can be located on the shortcut menu by right-clicking a word.
<P>
