<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Drawing object effects, such as AutoShapes, text boxes, regular drawing
objects, and WordArt are lost when you save a Word document as an HTML
document.
<P>
NOTE: Some Word templates and wizards contain drawing objects that will be
lost when the document is saved as HTML.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To place a drawing object in an HTML document, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the HTML document, place the insertion point where you want the new
   object to appear.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Object, and then click the Create New tab.

<P><LI>Under Object Type, double-click Microsoft Word Picture.

<P><LI>Using the Drawing toolbar, insert and format the drawing objects you
   want.

<P><LI>When you are finished, click "Close &amp; Return to &lt;Document name&gt;" on the
   File menu

<P><LI>Save and close the HTML document, and then reopen it by selecting the
   document from the list at the bottom of the File menu.

<P><LI>When you close this document, the objects will be saved as Graphics
   Interchange Format (GIF)images named Image.gif, Image2.gif, and so on.
<P>
</OL><h3>Notes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>You cannot edit pictures in an HTML document.  If you double-click a
   picture in an HTML document, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      You cannot edit a picture that is not saved in the document
</PRE>
<LI>The options for working with drawing objects are available only for
   Microsoft Word Picture objects.

<LI>If you apply transparency to drawing objects, these objects are not
   retained in a GIF image. To turn this setting on when you are
   inserting a Microsoft Word Document Picture, follow these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. On the Drawing toolbar, click Fill Color, and then click More Fill
       Colors.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. Click to select Semitransparent.
</PRE>
<LI>Microsoft Photo Editor is included with Microsoft Office and can
   help you create GIF images with transparent areas. Once created, you
   can then insert those images into your Web page as you would any
   picture or graphic.
<P>
</UL>For additional information about the Photo Editor, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : OFF97: Photo Editor Is Not Installed by the ValuPack

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
It is by design that the objects listed in the "Symptoms" section of this
article cannot be converted from a Microsoft Word document to an HTML
format. For additional information about HTML conversion limitations,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q157086.htm">Q157086</A></B>
   TITLE     : Limitations of Converting from Word Format to HTML

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Word converts graphics, such as pictures and clip art, to GIF (.gif)
format, unless they are already in JPEG (.jpg) format. Drawing
objects, such as text boxes and shapes, are not converted. Lines are
converted to horizontal rules.
<P>
When you save a Word document to HTML format, you will receive the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>   This document may contain formatting which will be lost upon conversion
   to HTML document format. To preserve the initial document, click No
   to exit this dialog, then save the document in Word format before
   converting.

   Continue with save?

</PRE>For more information about saving documents to HTML, click the Office
Assistant, type "HTML Picture" (without the quotation marks), click Search,
and then click to view the "Learn about working with graphics on Web pages"
topic.
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Word Help is not installed on your computer,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
