The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the WordBasic FileOpen command to open more than one file at
once, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 1078 - This file could not be found

</PRE>If you use the same command line in Word 6.x for Windows or Word 6.0 for
Windows NT, this error does not occur.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. Word for Windows 95 and Word 6.x for the
Macintosh both run under operating systems that support long file names.
Because long file names can contain spaces, there is no way to determine
whether a specified file name is intended to be one file or multiple files.
<P>
Consider the following macro sample, which is intended to open two files,
Test1.doc and Test2.doc:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MAIN
   FileOpen .Name="TEST1.DOC TEST2.DOC"
   End Sub

</PRE>Because a file named "TEST1.DOC TEST2.DOC" does not exist, the macro fails.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Word version 6.0 for Windows NT does not have this behavior because it
doesn't support spaces in file names. Word for Windows NT interprets the
space as a file delimiter and, therefore, tries to open multiple files when
it encounters spaces. For example, if you have a file called "My file.doc," 
it won't open with the WordBasic FileOpen command in Word for
Windows NT because files called "My" and "File.doc" don't exist.
<P>
When designing Word for Windows 95, to solve the problem of long file 
names, Microsoft changed the way the WordBasic FileOpen command worked. The
command no longer supports opening multiple files.
<P>
In general, it is not good programming practice to try to open more than
one file at once. If you open each file separately, you can determine which
files cannot be opened.
