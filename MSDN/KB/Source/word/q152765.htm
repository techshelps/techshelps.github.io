The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Word for Windows 95, you may receive one of the following
error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Application Error, Call to Undefined Dynalink

   -or-

   The server application, source file, or item cannot be found. Make sure
   the application is properly installed, and that it has not been
   deleted, moved, or renamed.

</PRE>NOTE: The steps to correct this problem in Word 7.0 are different from the
steps necessary to correct this problem in Word 6.0 because the OLE files
once installed by Word 6.x are installed by the Windows 95 operating
system. There are other changes to the OLE files that impact the process in
which Word 7.0 handles these files.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message appears when Word tries to use a DLL (Dynamic Link
Library) file that is missing, that is damaged, or that is a different
version from the version that Word was expecting.
<P>
Other programs may install DLL files with the same name as DLL files that
Word is expecting, but the these DLL files may not contain the same
information or perform the same functions. If Word encounters a DLL file
that contains unexpected information, it will generate the error message
described in the "Symptoms" section at the beginning of this article above.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, rename the following files and then
reinstall Microsoft Word.
<P>
<PRE>   Files in the Winword folder
   ---------------------------

   Winword.exe
   Wwintl32.dll

   Files in the Windows\System folder
   ----------------------------------

   Compobj.dll
   Docobj.dll
   Odbc32.dll
   Ole2.dll
   Ole2.reg
   Ole2conv.dll
   Ole2disp.dll
   Ole2nls.dll
   Ole2prox.dll
   Sdm.dll
   Stdole.tlb
   Storage.dll
   Typelib.dll

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>If you receive this error message in Word 6.x</h3>
 
<P>
The Ole2conv.dll, Ole2disp.dll, Ole2nls.dll, Compobj.dll, and
Storage.dll files are used by many applications for OLE support. Programs
other than Word may install earlier versions of these files. These outdated
versions can cause the error message to appear when you use Word version
6.x.
<P>
<P><h3>If you receive this error message in Word 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
The files Ole2conv.dll, Ole2disp.dll, Ole2nls.dll, Compobj.dll, and
Storage.dll are installed by Windows 95. In  Word 7.0 the function that
required the file Compobj.dll which was included in Word 6.x is handled by
the Docobj.dll file. However, Windows 95 still installs Compobj.dll because
this file is used by other programs.
<P>
Word 7.0 does not use the Ole2prox.dll file. Neither Word 7.0 nor Windows
95 install this file; however, it may be required by some 16-bit programs.
