                             INTRODUCTION
                             ============

</PRE>This Application Note tells how to create a table of contents in a
Microsoft Word document. A table of contents is a list at the beginning of
the document that tells what the topics of the document are and what pages
they appear on. It lists them in order of appearance. This Application Note
also tell how to create other types of tables, such as a table of figures
or a table of photos.
<P>
A table of contents is easy to create in Word. There are several ways to
create them, and this Application Note explains how to determine the best
method for you to use. This Application Note includes instructions for Word
for Windows, versions 2.0 and 6.0, and Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0.
Troubleshooting steps for when things don't look right are also given.
<P>
Creating a table of contents in Word is a two-step process. The first step
is to mark the document so that Word knows which text to include in the
table of contents. The second step is to build the table of contents. When
you build the table, Word looks through the document for all the marked
text. It lists the marked text in order and determines what page each item
is on.
<P>
<P><h3>HOW SHOULD I MARK MY TEXT?</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word offers two methods of marking the text you want to include
in a table of contents: applying styles and using TC field codes. (A style
is a collection of formatting. For example, a style named Title could be
defined as centered with bold, 24-point Arial formatting.) You can choose
whichever method best suits the needs of the document you have created. The
results will look the same, although using TC field codes offers more
flexibility.

<UL><LI>Applying heading styles is the faster way to mark text and is better for
   new users of Word. This method requires only two mouse clicks or one key
   combination. Heading styles work well if the document is already in
   outline format (that is, if you have already applied heading styles to
   all your heading paragraphs). When you mark text with a style for
   inclusion in the table of contents, Word copies all the text in the
   paragraph when it builds the table of contents. For instance, if you
   have a paragraph that consists of the words "Introduction to Cooking
   Methods" and you mark it with the Heading 1 style, the words
   "Introduction to Cooking Methods" will appear in the table of contents.

<LI>Using TC field codes is better if you don't want all the text in the
   paragraph to appear in the table of contents. For instance, if one
   paragraph consists of the text "Introduction to Cooking Methods" and you
   want only the word "Introduction" to appear in the table of contents,
   use a TC field code to mark the text.
<P>
   Former WordPerfect(R) users may find TC field codes the best method to
   use, as this method is more similar to WordPerfect's method of marking
   text. Text marked for inclusion in the table of contents in a
   WordPerfect document is converted to a TC field code when you open the
   document in Word.
<P>
</UL>In Word version 6.0, there is a third method of building a table of
contents. You can use both methods of marking text concurrently, and Word
will compile a table using the text marked both with styles and TC fields.
In Word version 2.0, only one method at a time can be used.
<P>
In Word version 6.0, you can use any styles (not just heading styles) to
mark text. In Word version 2.0, only heading styles can be used. lBoth
methods of marking text are explained in detail in this Application Note in
the "Microsoft Word Version 6.0" section that begins on page 4 and the
"Microsoft Word Version 2.0 for Windows" section that begins on page 16.
<P>
<P><h3>UPDATING THE TABLE OF CONTENTS</h3>
 
<P>
Entries in the table of contents and the page numbers on which they appear
will be accurate the first time you build the table. But if you mark new
text or delete existing text, or if the number of pages in the document
changes, you will need to update the table of contents.
<P>
The table of contents is actually the result of a TOC field code. To update
the table, turn field codes and hidden text off, place the insertion point
within the table, and press F9. Word can also update all the fields in the
document (including fields such as PAGE, DATE, and TOC) automatically when
you print the document. To turn the Update Fields option on, choose Options
from the Tools menu, select the Print tab or category, and under Printing
Options select the Update Fields check box. To turn the option off, clear
the check box.
<P>
<P><h3>TIPS TO REMEMBER</h3>
 

<UL><LI>You can mark text and build the table of contents at any time, but it's
   easier if you mark the text as you create the document and build the
   table of contents after you finish the document.

<LI>A fast way to update the table of contents is to click anywhere in the
   table and press F9.

<LI>If you are using Word version 2.0, be sure that both field codes and
   hidden text are off when you update the table of contents. Otherwise,
   the table of contents may not show the correct page numbers. Turn off
   field codes by selecting Field Codes from the View menu. Hide hidden
   text by choosing the Show/Hide button or by pressing ALT+SHIFT+8.

<LI>Once you build the table of contents in Word version 6.0, you can use
   the table to help you quickly move to any topic in the document. In the
   table of contents, double-click the page number of a topic you want to
   go to, and Word will immediately move you to that page!
<P>
<PRE>                      MICROSOFT WORD VERSION 6.0
                      ===========================

</PRE></UL><h3>METHOD 1: BUILDING A TABLE OF CONTENTS WITH HEADING STYLES</h3>
 
<P>
Mark the most important text in the document with Heading 1 style. In this
Application Note, the sections titled "Introduction," "Microsoft Word
Version 6.0," "Microsoft Word Version 2.0 for Windows," and
"Troubleshooting Problems in Word 2.0 and Word 6.0" are all marked with
Heading 1 style. Mark the next-most important text with Heading 2 style. In
this section, "Method 1: Building a Table of Contents with Heading Styles,"
"Method 2: Building a Table of Contents with Field Codes," and "Using
Shortcut Keys to Speed Work" are some of the sections we have marked with
Heading 2 style.
<P>
When you build the table of contents, text marked with Heading 1 style will
appear at the left edge of the table of contents, text marked with Heading
2 style will be indented about .25 inch, text marked with Heading 3 style
will be indented about .5 inch, and so on. You can change the indents by
formatting the table of contents. (This is explained in the "Formatting the
Table of Contents" section on page 9 of this Application Note.)
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1: Mark the Text You Want in Your Table</h3>
 
<P>

in the table of contents.
<P>
To mark text for inclusion in the table of contents:

<OL><P><LI>Select the text you want to include, and press ALT+SHIFT+O (Windows) or
   COMMAND+OPTION+SHIFT+O (Macintosh). The Mark Table Of Contents Entry box
   appears:
<P>
   If you want different text to appear in the table of contents, change
   the text in the Entry box.
<P>
   To mark the entry for inclusion in a table of figures or any other type
   of table, choose a different letter in the Table Identifier box.
<P>
   To assign a different indent level to the text, change the number in the
   Level box. (The level indicates the importance of the text. In this
   Application Note, "Introduction" and "Microsoft Word Version 6.0" are
   level 1 entries. "Method 1" is a level 2 entry; "Step 1" is a level 3
   entry.)

<P><LI>Choose Mark when you're done. Word creates a TC field in the document,
   formatted with hidden text, that contains the text you selected.

<P><LI>If you want to mark another item in the document, you can click in the
   document, and the Mark Table Of Contents Entry box will remain on the
   screen. Highlight the text you want to mark. Click the Mark button. You
   can continue scrolling through the document, selecting words for the
   table of contents and clicking the Mark button.

</PRE></OL>CREATING A TABLE OF CONTENTS OR INDEX IN A SEPARATE DOCUMENT
 
<P>
Reference document (RD) fields allow you to create a document that consists
only of a table of contents or an index. This can be useful if the chapters
of the document are in separate files and you want to keep them separate
for organizational or size purposes.
<P>
To create a document that consists only of a table of contents:

<OL><P><LI>Start a new document.

<P><LI>Display hidden text by clicking the Show/Hide button.

<P><LI>Display field codes by pressing ALT+F9 (Windows) or OPTION+F9
   (Macintosh).

<P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Field.

<P><LI>From the Categories list, select Index And Tables.

<P><LI>From the Field Names list, select RD.

<P><LI>Click in the Field Codes box. After RD (space) type the name of the
</OL>first file you want to include in the table of contents. Choose OK.
<P>
NOTE: In Word for Windows, if you are typing a full path, you must type the
backslashes twice. For example, if the file is called INTRO.DOC and is
located in the C:\MSOFFICE\WINWORD directory, you must type
C:\\MSOFFICE\\WINWORD\\INTRO.DOC in the Field Codes box after RD.
<P>
NOTE: In Word for Windows 95, version 7.0, if the filename or path contains
spaces, you must also enclose the path and filename in quotation marks. For
example, if the file is called INTRO 1.DOC and is located in the C:\MY
DOCUMENTS directory, you must type "C:\\MY DOCUMENTS\\INTRO 1.DOC" in the
Field Codes box after RD.
<P>
NOTE: In Word for the Macintosh, if the file or path name contains spaces,
you must enclose the path and filename in quotation marks. For example, if
the file is called INTRO and is located in Macintosh HD:Microsoft
Office:Word, you must type "MACINTOSH HD:MICROSOFT WORD:INTRO" in the Field
Code box after HD.

<OL><P><LI>Repeat steps 4 through 7 for each file that contains text you want to
   include in the table of contents.

<P><LI>Position the text insertion point where the desired Table of Contents or
   Index should appear.

<P><LI>To build the table of contents follow the steps described in "Step 2:
   Build a Table of Contents with Heading Styles" or "Step 2: Build a Table
   of Contents with TC Fields." To build the Index, select Index and Tables
   from the Insert menu, select the desired format and choose OK.
<P>
</OL>In Word for Windows, version 6.0, with field codes and hidden text on, your
document will look like the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   { TOC } or { INDEX }

   { RD c:\\msoffice\\winword\\intro.doc }

   { RD c:\\msoffice\\winword\\chapter1.doc }

   { RD c:\\msoffice\\winword\\chapter2.doc }

   { RD c:\\msoffice\\winword\\chapter3.doc }

</PRE></OL>In Word for Windows 95,version 7.0, with field codes and hidden text on,
your document will look like the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   { TOC } or { INDEX }

   { RD "c:\\my documents\\intro 1.doc" }

   { RD "c:\\my documents\\chapter1.doc" }

   { RD c:\\msoffice\\winword\\chapter2.doc }

   { RD c:\\msoffice\\winword\\chapter3.doc }

</PRE>NOTE: The quotation marks are only required when spaces are present in the
file or path name.
<P>
In Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0 and 6.0.1, with field codes and
hidden text on, your document will look like the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   { TOC } or { INDEX }

   { RD "Macintosh HD:Microsoft Word:intro.doc" }

   { RD "Macintosh HD:Microsoft Word:chapter1.doc" }

   { RD "Macintosh HD:Microsoft Word:chapter2.doc" }

   { RD "Macintosh HD:Microsoft Word:chapter3.doc" }

</PRE>NOTE: The quotation marks are only required when spaces are present in the
file or path name.
<P>
<P><h3>FORMATTING THE TABLE OF CONTENTS</h3>
 
<P>
When you create a table of contents, Word automatically applies a standard
style to each entry. Word formats first-level entries with the style TOC 1,
second-level entries with TOC 2, third-level entries with TOC 3, and so on.
These standard TOC styles are built in to Word and have preset formats (for
example, each level is indented by .25 inch). You can change how the table
of contents looks by modifying these styles.
<P>
Note that in Word version 6.0, selecting a format for the table of contents
from the Index And Tables dialog box will change the current TOC styles to
the format that you selected. In other words, if you modify the TOC styles
and then reinsert (replace) the table of contents using the menu (rather
than updating the existing table by pressing F9), the changes you made will
disappear. Your styles will be replaced with the standard, built-in TOC
styles.
<P>
For information about modifying standard styles, see the "Modifying the
Formats of a Style" section in Chapter 9 ("Automatic Formatting and
Styles") of the "Microsoft Word User's Guide".
<P>
<P><h3>SWITCHING FROM WORDPERFECT</h3>
 
<P>
Creating a table of contents in Word is similar to creating one in
WordPerfect. In WordPerfect, creating a table of contents consists of three
steps: marking text, defining the table of contents, and generating the
table of contents. In Microsoft Word, there are only two steps: marking
text and building the table of contents.
<P>
<P><h3>How Word and WordPerfect Differ</h3>
 
<P>
Word's method of marking text for the table of contents is different from
WordPerfect's method. In WordPerfect, a code appears at the beginning of
text that is to be included, and a code appears at the end. These codes are
visible when Reveal Codes is turned on. In Microsoft Word, you can mark the

<P><h3>Converting Existing WordPerfect Documents</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a WordPerfect document that contains a table of contents in
Word 6.0, the table of contents displays as it was originally created in
WordPerfect. Once you update the table of contents, however, all table of
contents text becomes left justified. This is because table of contents
entries in WordPerfect documents are converted as first-level entries in
Word for Windows.
<P>
To change the indent levels of the table of contents entries, edit the
field codes:

<OL><P><LI>Show hidden text by selecting the Show/Hide button on the formatting
   toolbar.

<P><LI>Show field codes choosing Options from the Tools menu, selecting the
   View tab, and selecting the Field Codes check box. Choose OK. Or, press
   ALT+F9 (Windows) or OPTION+F9 (Macintosh) to toggle display of field
   codes.

<P><LI>Move to the field code you want to change. Place the insertion point to
   the left of the right-most field bracket.

<P><LI>Type \L, a space, and the level number. For example, change this field
<P>
<PRE>        { TC "COOKING UTENSILS" }

   to this:

        { TC "COOKING UTENSILS" \L 2}

</PRE><P><LI>When you're finished making changes to the field codes, hide hidden text
   and hide field codes.

<P><LI>Update the table of contents by moving the insertion point to the table
   and pressing F9. Select the option to Update Entire table.
<P>
</OL><h3>SUPPRESSING PAGE NUMBERS</h3>
 
<P>
Word version 6.0 includes an option to hide page numbers. If you do not
want to include page numbers in your table of contents, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Place the insertion point where you want the table of contents to
   appear.

<P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Index And Tables.

<P><LI>Select the Table Of Contents tab.

<P><LI>Select the desired format.

<P><LI>Clear the Show Page Numbers check box.

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
   NOTE: There is no way to directly suppress page numbers for individual
   TOC levels--that is, "it's all or nothing." If need be, you can manually
   edit the table of contents after it is generated, but further updates to
   the table of contents will replace all of the page numbers. To prevent
   the table of contents from further updates, place the insertion point in
   the table of contents and press CTRL+F11 to lock the field code.
   CTRL+SHIFT+F11 will unlock the code if you want to update it later on.
<P>
</OL><h3>INCLUDING CHAPTER NUMBERING</h3>
 
<P>
Using Word version 6.0 you can apply chapter numbers to paragraphs with the
heading styles applied. You can format your document so that the chapter
numbers are included in the table of contents. Formatting a document in
this way also ensures that chapter numbers are included in the index.

<OL><P><LI>Use styles to mark the text you want to designate as chapter headings:
<P>
   Apply the style Heading 1 to each paragraph that is a chapter title. Do
   not label or number the headings. Word will do that automatically when
   you complete step 2. For example, do not precede the heading with
   "Chapter 1".

<P><LI>Format the chapter labeling and numbering:
<P>
   a. From the Format menu, choose Heading Numbering.
<P>
   b. From the Heading Numbering dialog box, select the chapter
<P><PRE>      numbering format you want to use. In this example, we have
      selected "Chapter 1".
</PRE><P>
   c. Choose the Modify button.
<P>
   d. With Level 1 appearing in the Level box (the box below the Help
<P><PRE>      button), select the formats you want to use from the Number

</OL><h3>INCLUDING CHAPTER AND APPENDIX HEADINGS IN THE TABLE OF CONTENTS</h3>
 
<P>
The following procedure tells how to (1) mark and automatically label and
number your chapter headings and appendix headings, (2) format the way page
numbers appear in each section of your document, and (3) have both chapter
headings and appendix headings (with their formatted page numbers) appear
in the table of contents.
<P>
Automatic numbering of chapter and appendix headings is useful when you
want to move, add, or delete chapters and appendixes without having to
manually renumber them. For example, if you start out with a document that
includes nine chapters and three appendixes and then you add one chapter,
delete two others, and switch the order of the appendixes, Word will
automatically renumber all the chapter and appendix headings and update the
entire table of contents accordingly when you update the document.
<P>
To automate the labeling and numbering of chapter and appendix headings,
format the page numbering, and include chapter and appendix headings in the
table of contents, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Use styles to mark the text you want to designate as chapter
   headings and appendix headings:
<P>
   a. Apply the style Heading 1 to each paragraph that is a chapter
<P><PRE>      title. Do not label or number the headings. Word will do that
      automatically when you complete step 2. For example, do not
      precede the heading with "Chapter 1".
</PRE><P>
   b. Apply a different heading style to each paragraph that is an
<P><PRE>      appendix title. Use a style that isn't used anywhere else in the
      document. In this procedure, we will use Heading 9 to label all
      appendix titles. Do not label or number the headings.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: If you are applying styles by choosing the Style list on
      the Formatting Toolbar, Heading 9 may not appear on the list.
      You can make it visible by holding CTRL+SHIFT (both Windows and
      Macintosh) before you click the down arrow to the right of the
      Style box.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      If you are applying styles by using the Format Styles menu, be
      sure that All Styles is selected in the List box in the lower-

   d. In the Modify Heading Numbering dialog box, with Level 1
<P><PRE>      appearing in the Level box (the box below the Help button),
      select the formats you want to use from the Number Format boxes.
      In this example, we have replaced the space in the Text After

</PRE><P>
   e. In the Level box, scroll down to Level 9. In the Text Before
<P><PRE>      box, type "Appendix " (with a space after the word "Appendix").
      In the Bullet Or Number box, select the numbering style you want

<P>
In Word version 2.0, you can mark figures, photographs, tables, and
anything else for inclusion in separate tables of contents. You can use
either heading styles or fields to mark these elements. Use unused heading
styles to quickly mark the items. If your document doesn't contain any
unused heading styles, you'll need to use fields.
<P>
<P><h3>To create multiple tables of contents using heading styles</h3>
 
<P>
To mark the headings you want to include in the various tables, assign a
different heading style to each group. For example, use Heading 1 through
Heading 6 to format the normal table of contents entries, use Heading 7 for
the titles of tables, use Heading 8 for the titles of photos, and use
Heading 9 for figures. To create the separate tables of contents, create a
separate TOC field for each heading level.

<P>
When you create a table of contents, Word automatically applies a standard
style to each entry. Word formats first-level entries with the style TOC 1,
second-level entries with TOC 2, third-level entries with TOC 3, and so on.
These standard TOC styles are built in to Word and have preset formats (for
example, each level is indented by .25 inch). You can change how the table
of contents looks by modifying these styles.
<P>
For information about modifying standard styles, see the "Using the
Standard Styles in Word" section in Chapter 8 ("Formatting with Styles") of
the Microsoft "Word for Windows User's Guide".
<P>
<P><h3>SWITCHING FROM WORDPERFECT</h3>
 
<P>
Creating a table of contents in Word 2.0 is similar to creating one in
WordPerfect. In WordPerfect, creating a table of contents consists of three
steps: marking text, defining the table of contents, and generating the
table of contents. In Microsoft Word, there are only two steps: marking
text and building the table of contents.
<P>
<P><h3>How Word 2.0 and WordPerfect Differ</h3>
 
<P>
The way in which Word marks the text for the table of contents is different
from WordPerfect's method. In WordPerfect, a code appears at the beginning
of text which is to be included, and a code appears at the end. These codes
are visible when Reveal Codes is turned on. In Microsoft Word, you can mark
the text by applying a certain style to it, or you can place a copy of the
text to be included in a field.
<P>
<P><h3>Converting Existing WordPerfect Documents</h3>
 
<P>
All table of contents entries convert as TC fields, with all the correct
level information.
<P>
<P><h3>USING CHAPTER AND HEADING NUMBERING</h3>
 
<P>
In Word version 2.0 for Windows you can use SEQ (sequence) fields to create
"chapter-page" numbering in the document; this numbering can also be used
in a table of contents. For example, you can use a SEQ field to insert 2-1
as the page number on page 1 of Chapter 2, and the table of contents will
show 2-1 as the page number.
<P>
The SEQ field is a counter. The first SEQ field appears as the number "1,"
the second shows the number "2," and so on. For more information on SEQ
fields, search in Word Help for the word "sequence."

<OL><P><LI>Create chapter numbering:

           TROUBLESHOOTING PROBLEMS IN WORD 2.0 AND WORD 6.0
          ==================================================

</PRE></OL><h3>PAGE NUMBERS ARE WRONG</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Page numbering starts with the page that the table of contents is on.
   Insert a section break at the end of the table of contents and restart
   the page numbers.

<LI>You may need to update all the fields in the document, especially if you
   have any cross-references that haven't been updated recently.

<LI>The table of contents "grew" by one or more pages and affected the
   numbering of pages that appear after it. Update the entire document by
   choosing Select All from the Edit menu and then pressing F9.

<LI>In Word version 2.0, this is usually caused by having field codes and
   hidden text displayed. Turn off both of these items and update the table
   of contents.
<P>
</UL><h3>THE TC FIELDS ARE MISSING</h3>
 
<P>
TC fields are automatically formatted with Hidden text attributes. To
display them, click the Show/Hide button.
<P>
Field Codes Are Printed Instead of
<P><h3>the Table of Contents or Page Numbers</h3>
 
<P>
If the field codes in the document are printed instead of their results,
you need to turn off that option. From the Tools menu, choose Options.
Select the Print category. Clear the Field Codes option. Choose OK.
<P>
<P><h3>FIELD CODES SHOW IN THE DOCUMENT</h3>
 
<P>
In Word 6.0, turn off display of field codes by choosing Options from the
Tools menu, selecting the View tab, and clearing the Field Codes check box.
Or, press ALT+F9. To view an individual field code, place the insertion
point within the field result and press SHIFT+F9.
<P>
In Word 2.0, turn off display of field codes by choosing Field Codes from
the View menu. Or, press ALT+F9. To view an individual field code, place
the insertion point within the field result and press SHIFT+F9.
<P>
<P><h3>ERROR MESSAGES</h3>
 
<P>
"Word found no paragraphs with heading
<P><h3>styles to include in the table of contents."</h3>
 
<P>
This message will appear if you try to insert a table of contents based on
text marked with heading styles, but you have not used heading styles in
the document. You must first mark the text that you want included with
heading styles or with field codes. Insert the table of contents after
marking the text.
<P>
<P><h3>"Error! No table of contents entries found."</h3>
 
<P>
You have opted to build a table of contents from field codes, but there are
none in the document. Insert the field codes in the document before you
insert the table of contents.
<P>
<P><h3>"Do you want to replace the selected table of contents?"</h3>
 
<P>
This message appears when you insert a table of contents through the menu
and you already have an existing table of contents in the document. If you
are merely updating the table of contents, choose Yes. If you want to
insert an additional table of contents, such as a separate table of
figures, choose No. The additional table will be inserted where the
insertion point is.
<P>
<P><h3>"Error! Bookmark not defined" prints instead of page number.</h3>
 
<P>
The document needs to be updated. The fastest way to do this is to select
the entire document by choosing Select All from the Edit menu, and then
pressing F9 to update all fields in the document.
