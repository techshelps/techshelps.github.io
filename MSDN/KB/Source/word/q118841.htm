The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word 6.0/6.0a provides an Award Wizard for the creation of an award
certificate. The wizard does not prompt you to modify character formatting
such as font, point size, and so forth. This article describes how you can
use the Award Wizard to create your own custom Award Wizard.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft does not support the modification of its wizards or
templates. Modifications done by the user are at the user's risk and
constitute no obligations or warranties, either written or expressed, by
Microsoft.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open. Choose the directory where your
    templates are stored--usually, C:\WINWORD\TEMPLATE. From the List Files
    Of Type list, select All Files (*.*), select the Award Wizard and
    choose the OK button. From the File menu, choose Save As and type a new
    name for the Wizard. Any formatting changes you make will now be stored
    in your new Wizard.

<P><LI>Modify the page orientation for the award style you plan to use. (From
    the File menu, choose PageSetup. Choose the Paper Size tab, select
    Landscape or Portrait, and choose the OK button.)

<P><LI>The following award styles are stored as AutoText in Word.
<P>
<PRE>       Award Style          Portrait          Landscape
       -----------          --------          ---------

       Formal               AwardStyle00      AwardStyle01
       Modern               AwardStyle10      AwardStyle11
       Decorative           AwardStyle20      AwardStyle21
       Jazzy                AwardStyle30      AwardStyle31

    From the Edit menu, choose AutoText. Select the desired AutoText entry,
    and choose the Insert button. Note which AutoText entry you have
    selected.

</PRE><P><LI>From the View menu, choose Page Layout. Note: Each AutoText entry
    contains both drawing objects and text boxes. These drawing objects are
    visible only in Page Layout view or Print Preview. (You will see a
    blank page after you insert the AutoText entry if you are working in
    Normal view.)

<P><LI>Toggle the Show/Hide button so that it is enabled, display table
    gridlines (from the Table menu, check Gridlines), and turn on Bookmarks
    (choose Options from the Tools menu, select the View tab, select the
    Bookmarks check box, and choose the OK button).
<P>
    NOTE: Do not delete any of the bookmarks. If these are deleted, the
    wizard may not function properly.

<P><LI>Highlight the text or table cell in which you want to make changes (be
    sure the end-of-cell marker or paragraph mark is also selected). Make
    your formatting changes, such as changing the font or point size,
    adding bold or italics, and so forth. When finished, deselect the area
    by clicking in the margin of the document.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose AutoText. Select the AutoText entry that you
    previously selected in step 3. Choose the Delete button to delete the
    old AutoText entry. Choose the Close button to return to the document.

<P><LI>Choose the Drawing button on the Standard Toolbar to activate the
    Drawing Toolbar.

<P><LI>Choose the Select Drawing Objects button on the Drawing Toolbar.
    Starting in the upper left corner of the template, click and drag down
    and to the right bottom corner to enclose the entire document area. A
    dashed line appears as you are dragging to enclose the objects.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose AutoText. In the AutoText dialog box, type
    the AutoText name using the same name as the deleted AutoText entry
    from step 7. From the "Make AutoText Entry Available To" list, choose
    Documents Based On the &lt;wizard name&gt;. Choose the Add button to return
    to the document.

<P><LI>With the document still selected, choose Cut from the Edit menu. You
    should now have a blank page with a single paragraph mark at the top
    left of the page. If you have any text or more than a single paragraph
    mark, delete these items. Choose Save from the File menu and then close
    the template.
<P>
</OL>Now you can use the Award Wizard with the style changes you made by
choosing New from the File menu, selecting Award Wizard from the Template
list, and choosing OK.
