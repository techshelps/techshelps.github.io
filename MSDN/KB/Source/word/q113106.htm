The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you copy styles from one template to another, Word for Windows does
not always retain the Based On information for each style in the
destination template. The style description contains all the correct
formatting, even if Word does not retain the Based On setting. In other
words, when Word does not retain the Based On setting, it moves all the
formatting from the Based On style to the style description in the copied
style.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 6.x, 7.x, 97</h3>
 
<P>
In Word 6.x, 7.x,and 97 use the Organizer to copy styles. To open
the Organizer dialog box, click Styles on the Format menu and then click
the Organizer button. To view the Based On setting for a selected
style, click Style on the Format menu and click the Modify button.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 2.x</h3>
 
<P>
To copy styles in Word 2.x, choose Style from the Format menu, choose the
Define button, then choose the Merge button. To view the Based On setting
for a selected style, choose Style from the Format menu and then choose the
Define button.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
First, Word copies the Based On setting only if specific criteria are met;
otherwise Word bases the style on Normal (see the list of criteria below).
<P>
Second, Word copies styles one-by-one, in alphabetical order, even when you
select multiple styles to copy. Word does not evaluate the entire selection
before it copies a group of styles. As a result, Word may determine that a
Based On style does not exist in the destination because it has not yet
copied it--even though Word will copy that style later as part of the same
Copy operation. Furthermore, when you copy a built-in style, Word asks if
you want to overwrite the existing built-in style definition in the
destination. If you copy all the styles from a template or document, Word
also asks whether you want to overwrite a user-defined style, even if that
style does not exist in the destination.
<P>
<P><h3>Criteria for Including Based On Setting in Copied Style</h3>
 
<P>
Below are the specific criteria Word uses to determine whether to include
the Based On setting when you use the Organizer to copy styles from one
document or template to another. In all the criteria, Word is copying style
A, which is based on style B.
<P>
<P><h3>Criterion 1: Style B Exists in the Destination</h3>
 
<P>
Word correctly copies style A to the destination and retains the Based On
setting. This happens if you copied style B before style A. (If you copied
both styles in the same Copy operation, style B occurs alphabetically
first, so Word copies it first.)
<P>
<P><h3>Criterion 2: User-Defined Style B Doesn't Exist in the Destination</h3>
 
<P>
Word copies style A to the destination and changes the Based On setting to
Normal. The style contains all the correct formats, including those from
the Based On style. In other words, Word adds any formatting from the Based
On style directly to the description of style A.
<P>
<P><h3>Criterion 3: Built-in Style B Doesn't Exist in the Destination</h3>
 
<P>
When you copy style A, which is based on style B, Word 6.0 and 7.0 create
style B and then copy style A.
<P>
Word 2.x copies style A to the destination and changes the Based On setting
to Normal. Style A contains all the correct formats, including those from
the Based On style.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Word listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you want Word to copy a style correctly, including the Based On setting,
make sure you copy the Based On styles first, in a separate Copy operation,
so they exist in the destination. The description area in Organizer will
specify the Based On setting for the selected style, making it easier to
identify what to copy first.
