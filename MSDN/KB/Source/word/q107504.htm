The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Word for Windows, when you start Find File, you may receive any of the
following errors:
<P>
<PRE>   WINWORD caused a General Protection Fault in STORAGE.DLL

   WINWORD caused a General Protection Fault in WINWORD.EXE

   Serious Disk Error

   Segment Load Failure

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1</h3>
 
<P>
These errors occur if the first file that Find File tries to access is
corrupt or located on a bad sector on the hard drive. In most instances,
the document gives the same error if you try to open it by other methods,
such as double-clicking on the filename in File Manager or by selecting the
filename from Word's Open dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2</h3>
 
<P>
A general protection (GP) fault occurs if you start Word with the /N switch
(to start Word with no document) and then open the Find File dialog box
while no document is open.
<P>
The GP fault does not occur if you start Word without the /N switch, if you
do not switch to Preview view in the Find File dialog box, or if you open
at least one document before you open the Find File dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Case 2 has been confirmed by Microsoft to be a problem in Word for Windows.
This problem was corrected in versions 6.0a and later of Word for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Windows File Manager to move the first document in the document
directory to another directory. Be sure that File Manager is listing the
files in the same order as Word's Find File, so that you can be sure of
moving the first file in the list.
<P>
If you are using search criteria to build a file list, rename FILEMAN.INI
(located in the Windows directory) to reset the Find File search criteria.
<P>
Restart Word and activate Find File again. Examine other directories and
documents before attempting to read the suspected corrupt document.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If you plan to use Find File, start Word without the /N switch.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>When you start Word with the /N switch, open at least one document
   before you use Find File.
<P>
