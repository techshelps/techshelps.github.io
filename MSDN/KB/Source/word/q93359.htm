<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word for Windows and Microsoft Excel are not TWAIN compliant. This means
that you cannot access a scanner from within Word to acquire graphics
images directly from a scanning program such as Hewlett-Packard (HP)
DeskScan IIp.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
TWAIN is the industry standard protocol for scanning and acquiring graphics
from software programs.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 97</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Photo Editor is designed to help Microsoft Word 97 users
import, edit, and manipulate pictures within Microsoft Office products.
Photo Editor can be used as a stand-alone imaging program or as an
OLE Server. For example, you can adjust the colors in a image, clean up
unwanted specks, create a negative image, and resize, crop, and rotate
a picture. You can scan pictures into Photo Editor using a TWAIN-
compatible scanner, or you can open existing pictures.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 6.x, 7.x, and Office 4.x</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Imager is designed to help Microsoft Word 6.0 and 7.0 and Office
4.x users import, edit, and manipulate pictures easily from within
Microsoft Office products. Imager can be used as a stand-alone imaging
program or as an OLE Server. For example, you can adjust the colors in a
image, clean up unwanted specks, create a negative image, and resize, crop,
and rotate a picture. You can scan pictures into Imager using a TWAIN-
compatible scanner, or you can open existing pictures.

</PRE>HP DeskScan IIp is a scanning software program you can use with the HP
ScanJet IIp, ScanJet IIc, and ScanJet Plus scanners. You can run DeskScan
IIp as a stand-alone program for scanning and saving images in different
file formats. You can also access DeskScan IIp from within a TWAIN-
compliant program using a special linking process. If you access DeskScan
IIp from within your program, you can select, scan, and insert a graphic
image that you have not previously saved on disk.
<P>
TWAIN-compliant programs add two commands to the File menu:

<UL><LI>Select Source: Use this command to select your scanner.

<LI>Acquire: Use this command to open DeskScan IIp when you want to
   scan and insert a graphic image in your current file.
<P>
</UL>The Hewlett-Packard products included here are manufactured by a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
