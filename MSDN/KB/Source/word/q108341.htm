The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Word for Windows integration features included with Microsoft Word for
Windows &amp; Bookshelf, Multimedia Edition, or Video and Sound Edition, will
work with Word 6.0 for Windows; however, the Setup program will not
successfully install those features with Word 6.0 since the Setup program
is designed to work with Word 2.0 for Windows only.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To install the Word and Bookshelf integration features for Word 6.0 for
Windows to successfully communicate with Bookshelf 1992 or 1994, use the
following steps.
<P>
These steps do not install the Online Word User's Guide included with the
Word &amp; Bookshelf CD-ROM. This guide is designed exclusively for use with
Word 2.0 for Windows.
<P>
Note: These steps assume Word 6.0 for Windows is already installed and
functioning normally.

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Word for Windows &amp; Bookshelf CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>In Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

<P><LI>Type "d:\setup" (without the quotation marks) and choose OK.
<P>
    If the CD-ROM drive is represented by a drive letter other than D, make
    the appropriate change in the line above to reflect the correct drive
    letter.

<P><LI>When the Setup program prompts for the Word directory (the "Install
    Word In:" option), be certain to specify the existing Word 6.0 for
    Windows directory already present on the hard drive.

<P><LI>The Setup program will report that it has detected an existing version
    of Word for Windows. Choose the Continue button to proceed.

<P><LI>When given the choice of installation type, choose the Custom
    Installation button.

<P><LI>When the Setup Options are displayed, clear every option except for
    Microsoft Bookshelf.
<P>
    Note: If the Setup program being used is for the Video and Sound
    Edition of Word &amp; Bookshelf, you can also select the "Video and Sounds"
    option. This option is optional and has no effect on the integration
    features between Word 6.0 and Bookshelf 1992.

<P><LI>Choose the Setup button and continue with the rest of the Setup program
    normally.

<P><LI>At the completion of the Setup program, Word 6.0 for Windows will be
    reporting a WordBasic error. Choose the OK button in the error window
    and restore the Word window from the minimized icon on the screen.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save As.

<P><LI>In the File Name box, type "c:\winword\startup\bookshlf.dot" (without
    the quotation marks) and choose the OK button.
<P>
    If your Word directory is located somewhere other than C:\WINWORD,
    modify the path given in the File Name box above to reflect the correct
    path.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Close.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose New then press the OK button to open a new
    document based on Normal.dot

<P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Macro.

<P><LI>From the "Macros Available In" list, select "Normal.dot (Global
    Template)".

<P><LI>For each of the following listed macros, select it in the Macro Name
    list and delete it by choosing the Delete button.
<P>
       AutoExec*
       Nul
       wabBookshelfDlg
       wabConst
       wabInsertVideo
       wabInsertVoiceAnno
       wabModifyToolbar
       wabReceive
       wabSetup
       wabSetupAll
       wabSetupUg
<P>
    *Note: If you are unsure whether the AutoExec macro is part of the Word
    &amp; Bookshelf Edition or if it is a different macro needed for other
    purposes, you can rename it instead of deleting it using Word 6.0's
    Organizer feature.

<P><LI>Choose the Close button in the Macro window.

<P><LI>Quit and restart Word.

<P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Customize.

<P><LI>Select the Menus tab.

    marks).

<P><LI>From the Macros list, select ------(Separator)------.

<P><LI>From the Change What Menu list, select &amp;Insert.

<P><LI>From the Position On Menu list, select (At Bottom).

<P><LI>Choose the Add button.

<P><LI>From the Macros list, select wabInsertVoiceAnno.

<P><LI>From the Change What Menu list, select &amp;Insert.

<P><LI>From the Position on Menu list, select (At Bottom).

<P><LI>In the Name On Menu text box, type "&amp;Voice Annotation" (without the
    quotation marks).

<P><LI>Choose the Add button.

<P><LI>From the Macros list, select wabInsertVideo.

<P><LI>From the Change What Menu list, select &amp;Insert.

    quotation marks).

<P><LI>Choose the Add button.

<P><LI>Choose the Close button to close the Customize window.

<P><LI>In the [Microsoft Word 2.0] section of the WIN.INI file, add the
    following line:
<P>
       programdir=C:\WINWORD
<P>
    If your Word directory is located somewhere other than C:\WINWORD,
    modify the "programdir" line given above to reflect the correct path.

<P><LI>Exit and restart Windows.
<P>
</OL>Adding Bookshelf 1992 Integration to Word 6.0 for Windows is now complete.
