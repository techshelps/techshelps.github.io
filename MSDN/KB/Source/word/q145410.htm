The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Insert Address button or the Schedule+ contact list as a
mail merge data source, the entries in the contact list are not sorted
alphabetically.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To sort the Schedule+ Contact List, use either of the following methods.
<P>
NOTE: Before running these methods, you need to already have created
entries in the Schedule+ contact list.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Use the Insert Address Button in Word</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Schedule+.

<P><LI>In Schedule+, Point to Export on the File menu, and then click Text.
<P>
    This starts the Text Export Wizard.

<P><LI>Click to select Contact List, and then click Next.

<P><LI>Click to select the character to use between fields (comma is the
    default) and click to select the character to use to surround each
    field (quotation marks are the default). Click Next.

<P><LI>In the next dialog box of the wizard, two questions appear. Use the
    following defaults, and then click Next:
<P>
<PRE>       Do you want to export text          Select No.
       containing carriage returns and     (No is the default).
       line feeds as a single line?

       Do you want to export the field     Select Yes.
       names on the first line?            (Yes is the default).

</PRE><P><LI>Click Add All to select all the fields from the contact list to export,
    and then click Next.
<P>
    NOTE: If you do not click Add All and only export certain fields, then
    you may lose some information  when you import this file back into
    Schedule+.

<P><LI>Use the file name suggested by Schedule+; the default should be
    c:\&lt;Windows&gt;\Desktop\Export.csv. Click Finish.  Schedule+ exports
    the contact list as a text file.

<P><LI>Start Word and open the exported file.

<P><LI>Sort the Contact Entries.
<P>
    a. On the Table menu, click Sort.
<P>
    b. In the Sort Text dialog box, click Options. Under Separate
       Fields At, click to select Commas, and then click OK.
<P>
    c. In the Sort Text dialog box, click to select My List Has Header Row.
<P>
    d. In the Sort By list click to select the field to sort the text by.
       For example, if you want to sort all the entries by the last name,
       click to select Last Name.
<P>
    e. Click OK to begin the sort.

<P><LI>Once the entries are sorted, save the file with the same name and
    extension and then close the file.
<P>
    NOTE: Save the file in the Text Only (*.txt) format. Do not save the
    file as a Word Document.

<P><LI>Switch to Schedule+. Click the Contacts tab. Select all of the Contact
    entries and delete them. The existing contact list has to be deleted
    before you can import the  newly sorted contact list to Schedule+; you
    need to delete  the existing list to avoid creating duplicate entries.

<P><LI>On the File menu, point to Import, and then click Text. This starts the
    Text Import Wizard.

<P><LI>Ensure that the exported file name appears in the File Name box. Click
    Browse to locate the file if necessary, and then click Next.

<P><LI>At the "Is the first line a list of field names?" prompt, click Yes
    (the default is Yes), and then click Next.

<P><LI>Click to select the character used between fields (comma is the
    default) and click to select the character used to surround each
    field (quotation marks are the default). Click Next.
<P>
    NOTE: In this step, you must select the same characters that you
    selected in step 4 when you exported the file.

<P><LI>Click Contact List under "Select the type of data in the file," and
    then click Next.

<P><LI>Select a type for the fields. The wizard lists the fields from the
    first line of the import file. To the right of each field is "IGNORE
    THIS FIELD." Select the first "IGNORE THIS FIELD" and a drop-
    down list appears. In the drop-down list, select the proper
    field name for this field. Repeat this step for each of the fields
    listed, and then click Finish. Schedule+ now imports the sorted file.

<P><LI>Quit and restart Word and Schedule+ for these changes to take effect.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Use the Schedule+ Contact List as a Mail Merge Data Source</h3>
 
<P>
To sort the contact list in a Word mail merge, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open or create your Word mail merge main document.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge. Click Get Data, and then click Use
   Address Book.

<P><LI>In the Use Address Book dialog box, click to select Schedule+ Contact
   List, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click Merge. In the Merge dialog box, click Query Options. Click the
   Sort Records tab. Click to select the field that you want to sort the
   data source by, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Perform the rest of the merge as usual.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Schedule+ for
Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a. This problem was corrected in Microsoft
Outlook 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Outlook may not have been installed when you ran Setup for
Microsoft Office 97 for Windows. The Setup program asks you if you want to
retain Schedule+ or to install Microsoft Outlook. If you retain Schedule+,
then Microsoft Outlook is not installed on your computer. You need to run
Setup again to install Microsoft Outlook.
<P>
You can use the contact list from Microsoft Schedule+ versions 7.0 and 7.0a
with the following versions of Word:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows

<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0 and 7.0a
<P>
</UL>You can only use the Microsoft Outlook 97 contact list with Microsoft Word
97 for Windows.
