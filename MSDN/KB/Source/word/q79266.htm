<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Word, you can define "rules" that determine whether or not a specific
record is included in a print merge. It is important to understand the
difference between the English language meaning of "AND" and the logical
meaning of "AND" to use these rules effectively.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The English language meaning of "AND" is equivalent to the logical
meaning "OR." For example, suppose you have a data file that includes
a STATE field and you want to perform a print merge of the records for
the STATE fields of North Carolina and Washington. In English, you say
"Include the records for North Carolina AND for Washington."
Logically, however, the statement is written as "Include the records
where STATE is North Carolina OR STATE is Washington."
<P>
When you use a logical "AND," both conditions must be true in order
for the expression to be evaluated as true. If you write the statement
"to include the records where STATE is North Carolina AND STATE is
Washington," it is logically impossible for both conditions to be true
in the same record. The state cannot be both North Carolina and
Washington; it has to be one or the other. Below is a chart that
describes how logical "AND" and "OR" are evaluated.
<P>
<PRE>   If X=A OR Y=B        If EITHER is true, the record is included.
   If X=A AND Y=B       If BOTH are true, the record is included.
