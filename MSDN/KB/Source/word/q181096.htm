<P>
<P><h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>What Are Objects?</h3>
 
<P>
"Object" is a generic term used to describe something you insert or paste
into a document. Text is usually not considered an object (it is considered
text). Examples of objects include the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Clip art pictures
   Drawing objects (text boxes, lines, AutoShapes, and so on)
   Equation Editor objects
   Graphics
   Microsoft Graph objects
   PowerPoint slides
   WordArt objects

</PRE>In Word 98, there are three basic types of objects. These types and a
description of the layers in which they can appear in Word are listed in
the following table. For information about the layers in a document, see
the "Description of the Layers of a Document" section of this article.
<P>
<PRE>   This type of object           Exists in this layer of Word
   ------------------------------------------------------------

   inline                   Only in the text layer and acts as a
                            single, large character. Text does
                            not wrap around it.

   framed                   Only in the text layer. Text always
                            wraps around it.

   floating                 Only in the drawing layer. Text may
                            or may not wrap around it.

</PRE><h3>Description of the Layers of a Document</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   -----------------
   |               |   In this layer you can place objects. Only "floating"
   |               |   objects can exist in this layer. If an object is in
   |               |   this layer, it will appear behind the text of the
   |               |   document (in most cases).
   |               |
   |               |
   |               |
   |               |
   |               |
   -----------------
   Layer 1--Below the text

   -----------------
   | This is the   | Generally speaking, this layer will contain the text
   |  text of      | of your document. You can, however, place objects in
   | the document  | this layer just as you can in the earlier versions
   |               | of Word. You can put the following types of objects in
   |               | this layer:
   |               |
   |               | text--all text and formatting for the document
   |               |
   |               | inline objects - objects that act as a single, large
   |               | character
   |               |
   |               | framed objects--objects that text will flow around
   -----------------
   Layer 2--The text layer

   -----------------
   |               | In this layer you can place objects. Only "floating"
   |               | objects can exist in this layer. If an object is in
   |               | this layer, it will appear in front of the text of the
   |               | document (in most cases).
   |               |
   |               |
   |               |
   |               |
   |               |
   -----------------
   Layer 3--Above the text

</PRE>Word has other layers that behave in the same way as the three layers
mentioned here. Other layers include the header/footer layers and the
footnote/endnote layers.
<P>
<P><h3>How Objects Are Handled in Versions 6.0 of Word</h3>
 
<P>
In versions of Word earlier than version 98 for Macintosh, all objects
exist in the same layer as the text of the document. You can insert objects
"inline" so that they act as a single, large, text character, or you can
use a frame. When you "frame" an object you can move the object around in
the document by dragging it, and you can get text to flow around the
object. Placing a graphic on top of text is virtually impossible in these
earlier versions of Word.
<P>
A line of text with an "inline" object will resemble the following (with
the box being the object):
<P>
<PRE>   text text text text text text text
                  |---|
                  |   |
   text text text |---| text text text text
   text text text text text text text text

</PRE>A line of text with a "framed" object will resemble the following (with the
box being the object). The text is said to "wrap" or "flow" around the
object:
<P>
<PRE>   text text text text text text text
   text text text |---| text text text
   text text text |   | text text text
   text text text |---| text text text text
   text text text text text text text text

</PRE>How Objects Are Handled in Version 98 of Word
 
<P>
Word version 98 includes a "drawing layer." A drawing layer can
be thought of as a clear sheet of paper on top of, and underneath, the text
of the document. This gives you the ability to place objects on separate
layers above and below the text of the document, in addition to the
traditional methods of placing objects in the text layer of the document.
You can also stack one object on top of another object in each drawing
layer. Objects in either the layer above the text layer or below the text
layer are called "floating objects."
<P>
<P><h2>CHOOSING THE APPROPRIATE TYPE OF OBJECT</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Floating Objects</h3>
 
<P>
Floating objects are powerful and flexible enough that you can get them to
emulate almost all of the behaviors of inline objects and framed objects.
In Word 98, most of the time, you should use a floating object rather an
inline or framed object.
<P>
When to Use a Floating Object:
<P>
Use a floating object when:

<UL><LI>You want text to wrap around the object (although a floating object can
   be formatted to not allow text wrapping).
<P>
   Floating objects can have text wrap around them in ways that a framed
   object cannot. Wrapping styles include Square, Tight, Through, Top And
   Bottom, and None. Wrapping locations include wrapping to the left
   side, the right side, the largest side, or both sides of the object

<LI>You want to be able to position the object by dragging it in the
   document using your mouse.

<LI>You want to be able to position the object in front of or behind the
   text layer. This is commonly done when creating a watermark.

<LI>You want to use other drawing features with the object.
<P>
</UL>Limitations of Floating Objects:
<P>
Certain features do not work well with floating objects. Generally
speaking, fields in the text layer do not recognize fields in the drawing
layer. If you need to be able to access information from a field, use a
frame. For example, use a frame when the object will include a field that
captures any of the following types of information:
<P>
<PRE>   Cross-references

   Captions

   Table of Contents entries

   Index entries

   Table of Figures entries

   Table of Authorities entries

</PRE>NOTE: If you want to be able to view the field codes, you should use a
frame rather than a floating object. Note also that you should use a frame
if you will want to be able to use the Find And Replace feature to locate
the object by object type. For example, you should use a frame if the
object is a picture and you want to be able to find it by searching for
"Graphic" using the Special search criteria in the Find And Replace dialog
box.
<P>

     TITLE: WD97: Problems with Float Over Text Objects

</PRE><h3>Inline objects</h3>
 
<P>
Use an inline object when:

<UL><LI>You do not want text to wrap around the object.

<LI>You want to format the object as a character, using tabs, indents,
   paragraph formatting, character formatting, and so on.

<LI>You want to position the object in a table cell.
<P>
</UL><h3>Frames</h3>
 
<P>
Use a frame when you need an object to behave like a floating object, and
you need to use special features with it. For more information, see the
"Limitations of Floating Objects" section earlier in this article.
<P>
<P><h2>CHANGING ONE TYPE OF OBJECT TO ANOTHER</h2>
 
<P>
From time to time, it may be necessary to convert one type of object to
another.
<P>
<P><h3>Floating Objects</h3>
 
<P>
To Convert a Floating Object to an Inline Object:
<P>
To convert a floating object to an inline object, use either of the
following methods.
<P>
NOTE: For Office Art objects, the Float Over Text check box mentioned in
the "Method 1" solution will be selected and unavailable. You will be
unable to turn off this option. For these objects, use the Method 2
solution.
<P>
<PRE>   Method 1: Clear the Float Over Text Check Box:

   1. Right-click the floating object.

   2. On the shortcut menu, click Format &lt;object&gt;.

   3. Click the Position tab.

   4. Clear the Float Over Text check box.

   Method 2: Use a Macro:

   1. Click the object. On the Edit menu, click Cut.

   2. Run the macro described in the following article:

      TITLE: WD97: Macro Changes Default Paste Mode from Float Over to
             Inline

</PRE>To Convert a Floating Object to a Framed Object:
<P>
There may be times when you need your objects to act like floating objects,
but you need certain features that are only available when using framed
objects. In these few cases, it may be necessary to convert a floating
object to a framed object. For more information about when to use a framed
versus a floating object, see the "Limitations of Floating Objects" section
earlier in this article.
<P>
To convert a floating object to a framed object, use either of the
following methods.
<P>
<PRE>   Method 1: Use an Inline Object

   With this method, you will first convert the floating object to an
   inline object, and then you will convert that inline object to a framed
   object. To do this, use the following steps:

   1. Use the following steps to convert the floating object to an inline
      object:

      (a) Right-click the floating object.
      (b) On the shortcut menu, click Format &lt;object&gt;.
      (c) Click the Position tab.
      (d) Clear the Float Over Text check box.

   2. Use the following steps to convert the inline object to a framed
      object:

      (a) Click the object to select it.
      (b) On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.
      (c) In the "Macros In" drop-down box, click Word Commands.
      (d) For the Macro Name, type "InsertFrame" (without the quotation
          marks), and click the Run button.

   Method 2: Use the Convert To Frame Option:

   Text boxes and callouts have a special Convert To Frame option available
   that is not available for other shapes. To use this feature, follow
   these steps:

   1. Right-click the text box or callout object.

   2. On the shortcut menu, click Format &lt;object&gt;.

   3. Click the text box tab.

   4. Click the Convert to frame button.

   The text box or callout is now a frame in the text layer of the
   document.

</PRE><h3>Inline Objects</h3>

      button below to add Frame to the Insert menu so you can quickly and
      easily insert frames.
</PRE><P>
   Clicking Yes will add the command to the Insert menu.
<P>
</OL>Once the command is added, you can click Frame on the Insert menu (you will
no longer need to use the InsertFrame macro command).
<P>
The object will now be in a frame and you can move it around in the
document by dragging it.
<P>
<P><h3>Framed Objects</h3>
 
<P>
To Convert a Framed Picture to an Inline Picture:

<OL><P><LI>Right-click the picture.

<P><LI>click Format Picture on the shortcut menu.

<P>
Objects Move Around on the Screen, Are Not Inserted
or Pasted Correctly, or Move to the Next Page
 
<P>
This is a side effect of the object being inserted or pasted as a floating
object. The solution is to do either of the following.
<P>
Method 1:
<P>
Paste or insert the object, find it, and then drag it to the desired
location, or convert it to an inline object.

</PRE><h3>Objects Disappear When You Insert or Paste Them</h3>
 
<P>
The object you inserted or pasted may have landed on top of another object.
Click the object you just inserted or pasted and drag it using the
mouse. You may see another object underneath it. From here, you can
position each object in the desired location by dragging it.
<P>
The object you inserted or pasted may have landed on another page or on a
different part of the current page. Scroll around in the document until you
locate it. Then, you can drag it back to the desired location.
<P>
<P><h3>You Cannot See Objects in Some Views</h3>
 
<P>
Floating objects cannot be seen in normal, outline, or master document
view. Switch to online layout or page layout view in order to see the
object.
<P>
There is also a view setting that needs to be enabled in order to see
floating objects. To turn this setting on, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click options.

<P><LI>Click the View tab.

<P><LI>Click to select the Drawing Objects check box.
<P>
</OL><h3>Objects Cannot Be Inserted or Pasted into a Table or the Table Is Split</h3>
 
<P>
If you are unable to insert or paste and object or if the table splits into
two tables when you insert or paste an object, you must convert the object
from a floating to an inline object. To do this, use either of the
following methods.
<P>
Method 1:
<P>
Paste or insert the object, find it, convert it to an inline object, and
then cut and paste it into the table cell.

<P>
The ability (or inability) to view the field code does not change the
functionality of the field code. Therefore, there really isn't a need to
make the field code visible. If, however, you want to be able to view the
field code, you will need to convert the floating object to an inline
object or a framed object.
