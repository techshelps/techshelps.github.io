The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, Service Release 1 (SR-1)
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, click Help in
Registry Editor, click the Contents tab, and click to view the "Restoring
the Registry" topic.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word 97 SR-1 allows you to use drive letter mappings and disable
Universal Naming Convention (UNC) by using the "DontUseUNC" registry
switch.
<P>
There are many situations in which a network administrator may prefer to
have Word use a mapped drive letter rather than the UNC file location.
For example, Word returns a UNC file location similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   \\ServerName\ShareName\FileName

</PRE>However, when you use the DontUseUNC registry switch, Word returns a
drive mapping similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   E:\ShareName\FileName

</PRE>NOTE: The DontUseUNC switch does not work with earlier versions of Word.
It only works with Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 or later. The
switch also does not affect the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) which is a
separate program. In the VBE, if a reference is made to a template
on a mapped network drive via the References command on the Tools menu, it
stores the path with the UNC information rather than a mapped drive
letter.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By design, when you save a document or change a setting to a location
specified with a drive letter, Microsoft Word converts the setting
from a location containing a logical drive letter to a UNC location. When
you use the DontUseUNC Registry switch, the following new created/attached
paths contain the logical drive letter instead of using the UNC path:

<UL><LI>The File Locations tab in the Options dialog box. (On the Tools menu,
   click Options, and then click the File Locations tab.)

<LI>The FileName field when the \p switch is used.

<LI>The IncludePicture field.

<LI>The Link field.
<P>
</UL>To add the DontUseUNC registry switch, use either of the following
methods.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Change the Registry</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs after you
edit it. For information about how to do this, click Help in Registry
Editor, click the Contents tab, and click to view the "Restoring the
Registry" topic.
<P>
IMPORTANT: Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail, before you use
the following steps.
<P>
To change the DontUseUNC Registry setting, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run.

<P><LI>In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks),
   and then click OK.

<P><LI>Locate the following registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Options
</PRE>
<P><LI>Double-click the Options key.
<P>
   If an entry exists in the right pane named DontUseUNC, skip to step 7.
<P>
   NOTE: Use steps 5-6 only when you are adding the DontUseUNC option to
   the registry.

<P><LI>With the Options key selected, point to New on the Edit menu,
   and then click DWORD Value. This inserts a new option named "New
   Value #1."

<P><LI>In the right pane of the Registry editor window, do either of the
   following:
<P>
   - If "New Value #1" is selected
<P>
<P><PRE>      a. Press DELETE on your keyboard to delete the option name "New Value
<PRE></PRE>         #1".

      b. Type "DontUseUNC" (without the quotation marks), and then press
         ENTER.

     This renames the new option to the correct DontUseUNC name.

     -or-

   - If "New Value #1" is not selected

      a. Click to select "New Value #1."

      b. On the Edit menu, click Rename.

      c. Type "DontUseUNC" (without the quotation marks), and then press
         ENTER. This renames the new option to the correct DontUseUNC name.

</PRE><P><LI>With DontUseUNC selected, click Modify on the Edit menu.

<P><LI>In the Value Data box, type "1" (without the quotation marks).
<P>
   This setting disables the use of UNC and forces Word to use
   a logical drive letter.
<P>
   NOTE: Setting "Value Data" to 0 or deleting the DontUseUNC key
   resets Word to the default and allows it to resolve file
   locations using UNC.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Use the RegOptions Macro</h3>
 
<P>
The RegOptions macro is part of the Support8.dot template that is shipped
with Word 97 SR-1 Enterprise Update. If you used the SR-1 Patch to update
Word, you need to obtain the Support8.dot template separately.
