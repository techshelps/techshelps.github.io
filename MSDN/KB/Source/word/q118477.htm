The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Woody's Office Power Pack (WOPR 6.0 &amp; WOPR 95) is a collection of add-in
tools for Word for Windows, versions 6.0 (WOPR .6.0) &amp; 7.0 (WOPR 95). You
can install all or some of the tools through the WOPR Setup program. Some
of these tools will replace Word commands with customized macros.
<P>
WOPR also includes instructions for removing each tool in the "WOPR Quick
Start News," included with the package.
<P>
The major tools supplied with WOPR are: Enveloper, File Manager, TBEdit,
Two-by-Four, File New, Stellar Spellar, WinBreak Lite, TSS Address Book
Lite, and Little WOPRs. Following is a description of each of these tools:
<P>
<P><h3>Enveloper</h3>
 
<P>
This feature allows the printing of POSTNET bar codes at the bottom of the
envelope, either above or below the addressee information. It allows you to
print logos, graphics, and notes on your envelopes. You can maintain
multiple customized envelopes for different situations: envelope size,
return address, note, logo, FIM markings, fonts, and so forth. You can also
look up a saved address from within Enveloper by clicking on a button that
consults the WOPR Address Book utility.
<P>
<P><h3>File Manager</h3>
 
<P>
The File Manager allows you to open, copy, move, rename, delete, and print
documents from one dialog box within Word. You can change file attributes,
make new directories, preview file contents and summary information, and
jump to commonly used subdirectories. The File Manager shows the file's
size, date, author, title, subject, and the first few pages of the document
before you open it. It also provides the ability to create new directories
just before saving your documents.
<P>
<P><h3>TBEdit</h3>
 
<P>
This is a replacement toolbar editor. It allows you to draw with different
kinds of brushes; nudge drawings up, down, left, or right one bit at a
time; fill, rotate, and flip; and take a snapshot of anything on the
screen, turning it into a toolbar button. You can store icons in files for
future use.
<P>
<P><h3>Two-by-Four</h3>
 
<P>
This is a Word 6.0 macro add-in with several multi-page printing features
including Duplex, 2Up, 4Up, TriFold Pamphlets, Greeting Cards, Thumbnails
and Booklets. Using this tool you can print two, four, or more pages on a
single sheet of paper.
<P>
<P><h3>File New</h3>
 
<P>
WOPR's File New dialog lets you create descriptions for all of your
templates and assign them to subdirectories of your choosing. For example,
you can assign "Short Form Invoices" to your INV.DOT template and indicate
that all new Short Form Invoices should be stored in
C:\WINWORD\INVOICE\SHORTFM. The next time you need a Short Form Invoice,
choose New from the File menu and select Short Form Invoices from the list.
<P>
<P><h3>Stellar Spellar</h3>
 
<P>
This tool allows you to use the right mouse button to spell check whatever
word the cursor is pointing at. Clicking the right mouse button on a word
results in a list of alternate spellings. By scrolling down the list and
selecting the correct spelling, you replace the misspelled word. By holding
down the CTRL key when you right-mouse click, your selection automatically
creates an AutoCorrect entry for the misspelled word.
<P>
<P><h3>WinBreak Lite</h3>
 
<P>
WinBreak helps you to remember to take a break by putting a reminder up on
your screen (or playing a wave file). WinBreak counts keystrokes and
watches your mouse movement to determine when you need to take a break. You
can set up both the time between breaks as well as the length of break you
think you should take.
<P>
<P><h3>TSS Address Book Lite</h3>
 
<P>
This tool keeps track of your most frequently needed names, addresses, and
phone numbers. One click will insert a name, address, and salutation
directly into your document. You can print a detailed report of all your
TSS Address Book records. The full version of TSS Address Book is included
as part of both "Total System Solutions Fileware" (TM), and "DocuPower Pro"
(TM). WOPR users receive a "lite" version and are entitled to a discount on
either of the full versions.
<P>
<P><h3>Little WOPRs</h3>
 
<P>
This add-in package includes the following Word 6.0 macros.
