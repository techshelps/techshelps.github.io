The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using the StartConversionWizard (formerly called BatchConversion)
supplied with Microsoft Word, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Converter Error

</PRE>When you click OK, the following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot complete the conversion of this file--&lt;filename&gt;.
   Would you like to continue with the batch conversion?

</PRE>NOTE: When you click Yes, the same error message is repeated four times. On
the third and fourth occurrence of this message, the file name extension
(for example, .doc) will not appear in the error message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message may occur in either of the following cases.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: Same Format Converting From and To</h3>
 
<P>
This error message will appear if the format of the document selected for
conversion is the same as the format you are converting to.
<P>
For example, this problem will occur under the following conditions:

<UL><LI>You are converting from WordPerfect 5.1 to Word 97.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>A Word 97 file exists in the batch of files you have selected for
   conversion.
<P>
</UL>You will receive the error message when the Batch Conversion Wizard
attempts to convert the Word 97 document to Word 97 format.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2: Insufficient Disk Space</h3>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the StartConversionWizard source folder is
set to a drive that has insufficient disk space, regardless of whether the
destination folder is set to a different drive that has plenty of available
disk space.
<P>
When there is insufficient disk space available on the drive containing the
source folder, Microsoft Word does cannot create temporary files;
therefore, Word is unable to complete the conversion of any of the
remaining files.
<P>
Case 3: Files with Numerical Names
 
<P>
Sometimes this message is followed by the same error message again once or
even twice, but instead of the file's extension appearing in the error message,
the extension specified in the error message is ".." (without the quotes).
<P>
Word will randomly save some but not all of the the files after they have been
converted. For example if six files were chosen to convert, Word may only save
1, 2 or 3 of the files or none at all after the Conversion Wizard is finished
converting. The files not saved will remain open on the screen in Word and can
be saved manually.
<P>
This occurs if the filenames of the files being converted begin with a
numerical character, such as:
<P>
03604.doc
1212.01
444.555
1.doc
0003.xx
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the methods appropriate for the type of
problem you are having.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: Same Format Converting From and To</h3>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1: Select Documents with a Format Other Than the "Convert To"
Format:
<P>
In the File Selection area of the Batch Conversion Wizard dialog box, do
not select documents for conversion whose file type matches the conversion
type. For example, if you are converting from WordPerfect 5.1 to Word 97
document format, do not select a Word 97 document for conversion to Word 97
format.
<P>
Method 2: Move Documents of Same File Type to Another Location:
<P>
Move the documents having the same file format as the "convert to" type to
a different directory or folder prior to running the Batch Conversion
Wizard. For example, if you are converting documents to Word 97, move any
Word 97 documents out of the folder before running the conversion macro.
<P>
Method 3: Run the Batch Conversion and Ignore the Error Message:
<P>
All files whose format differs from the format you are converting to will
be converted properly.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2: Insufficient Disk Space</h3>
 
<P>
Make sure there is enough disk space available on the drive where the
source folder is located, or, move the files that need to be converted to
another drive that has more available disk space. The amount of space
needed depends on the number and size of the files you are converting.
<P>
Case 3: Files with Numerical Names
 
<P>
Rename the documents with alpha characters for filenames instead of numeric
characters. The file extension can remain numerical.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
