The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has released three versions of the Macro Virus Protection Tool.
This Word add-in detects one specific macro virus and protects against
macro viruses in general.
<P>
The three versions of the Macro Virus Protection Tool, as described in this 
article, do not function in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows and Microsoft 
Word 98 Macintosh Edition. Word 97 for Windows and Word 98 for Macintosh 
have a built-in detection scheme that warns you when you are opening 
documents or templates that contain macros.
<P>
This article describes the different versions of the ScanProt tool.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For more information on using ScanProt with Word 97 for Windows, please see 
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q158499.htm">Q158499</A></B>
   TITLE     : Cannot Use ScanProt with Word 97

</PRE>NOTE: This tool was created and released as a temporary measure; use
ScanProt until you can obtain a virus protection utility created and
maintained by one of the companies specializing in virus protection.
ScanProt is not intended to be a permanent fix, and is updated
infrequently. It may not detect newer versions of virus macros.
<P>
For information on obtaining software designed specifically for detection
and prevention of macro viruses, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Anti-Virus Software Vendors

</PRE>Note that the ScanProt tool does offer some protection from future
infection by warning you that the document being opened includes macros
that could contain a virus. However, it is not sophisticated in its
detection methods and could be bypassed. We therefore strongly suggest that 
you secure a more comprehensive protection utility as soon as possible.
<P>
<P><h3>History</h3>
 
<P>
The three versions of the Macro Virus Protection Tool are described in the
following table.
<P>
<PRE>   File name    Information about this version
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Scan831.doc  This version was released just after the macro viruses were
   8/30/95      first discovered. It has several known shortcomings that 
                were addressed in the next release. Do not use this 
                version; use a later version instead.

   Scanprot.dot This version corrects the problems discovered in 
   10/2/95      Scan831.doc and should be used with all American English 
                versions of Word (6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0a, 6.0c, and 7.0).

                NOTE: This version should NOT be used with Word for Windows
                version 7.0a. If you have Word version 7.0a, use the later
                version of Scanprot.dot.

                This file is available for download from the Microsoft
                Software Library (as Mw1222.hqx for the Macintosh and
                Wd1215.exe for Windows):

                 ~ Mw1222.hqx
                 ~ Wd1215.exe

   Scanprot.dot This version addresses problems that occur when you run the
   5/17/96 or   previous version of Scanprot.dot with the built-in 
   5/10/96      protection implemented in Word version 7.0a. It also 
                includes support for foreign localized versions of Word. 
                While this version will work on the Macintosh it offers no 
   Use with     significant improvement over the version already released    
   Word for     and is quite a bit larger.
   Windows 95
   version 7.0
   only         How this version is different from the previous edition of
                Scanprot.dot:

                1. The CleanAll macro now closes all files in Word before
                   running. It opens each document on screen as it checks
                   it.

                2. CleanAll turns off 7.0a macro virus protection before
                   running.

                3. CleanAll enables 7.0a macro virus protection after 
                   running or exiting.

                4. AutoOpenScan does not install protective macros.

                5. AutoOpenScan does not ask you if you want to install the
                   protection. It's automatic.

                6. Checks the normal template for the concept virus,
                   regardless of Word version.
