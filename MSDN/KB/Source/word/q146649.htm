The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to print envelopes correctly from Microsoft Word 
to the Hewlett-Packard (HP) 5MP printer, using both the Envelopes And 
Labels dialog box and the Mail Merge feature.
<P>
You need version 8.0 or later of the LaserWriter or Hewlett-Packard 
LaserJet driver in order to print envelopes correctly to these printers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before printing envelopes in Word, the correct PPD (printer description
file) must be selected using the Chooser.
<P>
<P><h3>Configuring the Printer Driver</h3>
 
<P>
In order to print envelopes correctly, you need version 8.0 or later of the 
Apple LaserWriter or HP LaserJet driver; version 8.1.1 or later is 
recommended.
<P>
To configure the printer driver, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Apple menu, click Chooser.

<P><LI>Locate the printer driver for your LaserWriter or LaserJet and select
   it.

<P><LI>Select the actual printer in the "Select a &lt;Printer Driver Name&gt;
   Printer" list.

<P><LI>Click Setup.

<P><LI>Click Auto Setup. Click OK.
<P>
   The PPD should be automatically selected for you.
<P>
   NOTE: If you get a warning message that the correct PPD cannot be
   located, make sure that you have the PPD for your printer in the
   Printer Descriptions folder (either in the System folder or in the
   Extensions folder). If you ran the standard setup for the driver, this
   file should already be properly installed.
<P>
   You must use the HP 5MP PPD to print envelopes on this printer.

<P><LI>Close the Chooser.
<P>
</OL><h3>To Print Envelopes from the Envelope Dialog Box</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Envelopes And Labels. Select the Envelope     
<PRE>tab.

</PRE><P><LI>Type the Return and Destination addresses.

<P><LI>Click Options. Select the Printing Options tab.

<P><LI>Choose the Left Portrait icon (fourth from the left), and make sure
    the Face UP option is selected and the Clockwise Rotation check box
    is cleared.

<P><LI>Select the Envelope Options tab. Under Envelope Size, select Size 10
    (4 1/8 x 9 1/2 in). If desired, add bar codes and change the font of
    the return and/or destination addresses. Choose OK.

<P><LI>Be sure the printer is on and ready (Power Ready light is on).

<P><LI>Click the Print button. The Printer dialog box should appear.

<P><LI>Open the multi-purpose tray on the front of the printer, and open the
    rear output tray.

<P><LI>Slide the paper width guide to the left until it is at the envelope
    setting (as indicated on the engraved diagram). Slip the envelope
    into the gap between the left side of the paper tray and the paper
    width guide until it just touches the feed wheel, and adjust the
    guide until it is against the envelope, but not too snug.

<P><LI>In the dialog box, click Print (auto select should already be
    selected).
<P>
</OL>The envelope should now print correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>To Print Envelopes Using Mail Merge</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Mail Merge.

<P><LI>In the Mail Merge Helper dialog box, under Step 1: Main Document,
    click Create Envelopes. Click Active Window or New Main Document.

<P><LI>Under Step 2: Data Source, click Create Data Source. If your data
    file has already been created, select Get Data, and then select Open
    Data Source from the list that appears. Select your data file in the
    Open dialog box and click Open.
<P>
    NOTE: Skip steps 4, 5, and 11 if you opened an existing data file in
    step 3.

<P><LI>Choose the fields you want (for example, Title, First Name, Last Name,
    Address, and so forth) and select OK.

<P><LI>Give the data source (data document) a name in the Save Current
    Document As box and save the document.

<P><LI>In the next dialog box, choose the Set Up Main Document button, which
    opens the Envelope Options dialog box.

<P><LI>Select the Envelope Options tab and select the envelope size (Size
    10).

<P><LI>Select the Printing Options tab. Choose the Left Portrait icon
    (fourth from the left), and make sure the Face UP option is selected
    and the Clockwise Rotation check box is cleared. Choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Envelope Address dialog box, insert the merge fields for the
    destination address. Choose the Insert Postal Bar Code button if you
    want to add a postal bar code or a FIM-A courtesy reply mail bar code
    to your envelopes. Click OK.

<P><LI>In the Mail Merge Helper dialog box, under Step 2: Data Source, select
    Edit Data: &lt;&lt;document name&gt;&gt; and enter your data in the data form.
    Click OK.

<P><LI>The main document is now set up properly to print envelopes and be
    merged with the data source (data file). Click Merge under Step 3: 
    Merge the Data with the Document, select Merge To Printer, and click
    Merge.

<P><LI>Slide the paper width guide to the left until it is at the envelope
    setting (as indicated on the engraved diagram). Slip the envelopes
    into the gap between the left side of the paper tray and the paper
    width guide until it just touches the feed wheel. Adjust the
    guide until it is against the envelopes, but not too snug.

<P><LI>To print envelopes continuously, start the PrintMonitor. On the File
    menu, click Preferences, select Give No Notification, and then click
    OK. If you omit this step you need to feed envelopes one at a
    time until the mail merge is completed.

<P><LI>Return to Word, select Manual Feed, and then click Print in the
    dialog box (auto select should already be selected). If you skipped
    step 13, add more envelopes as needed until the mail merge is
    completed.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you merge the envelopes to the printer with Auto Select, you
have to make sure you have at least as many envelopes as the number of 
records being merged.  If you do not, the printer automatically starts 
pulling paper from the paper cassette when the envelope supply runs out.
