The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information from SCNVINFO.DOC, which can be
decompressed from Disk 2 of the Supplemental Converters for Word for
Windows 6.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>AutoCAD DXF Graphics</h3>
 
<P>
The AutoCAD DXF graphic import filter supports AutoCAD versions through
version 12. AutoCAD version 11 includes a feature that enables the user to
place special borders around the drawing. When these borders are imported,
the converter overlaps the borders and graphics. To import such drawings,
remove the borders or send the file through the ADI plotter to a plot file,
then import the resulting plot file directly into Word for Windows.
<P>
This filter has the following limitations:

<UL><LI>Extrusions, which are related to 3-D entities, are not supported.

<LI>Control codes and special characters (except underlining) embedded in
   text shapes require special characters and are not supported.

<LI>DXF files requiring separate shape definition files are not supported.

<LI>For multiple viewport DXF files, the file is imported using the current
   viewport.
<P>
</UL><h3>AutoCAD ADI Binary Plotter Files</h3>
 
<P>
The Word for Windows 6.0 AutoCAD ADI graphic import filter, ADIMPORT.FLT,
supports binary plotter file output from all versions of AutoCAD (up to and
including version 12) via the Autodesk Device Interface (ADI).
<P>
The ADI Binary graphic filter can be used to import any image saved in the
ADI format, including 3-D images with a viewport selected. Since ADI files
only refer to pen number without specifying what color each pen is, all
pens are assumed to be black. Thus, all images will be black and white.
<P>
<P><h3>Exporting ADI Binary Graphics from AutoCAD</h3>
 
<P>
In AutoCAD, you can configure one pen plotter and one printer plotter
device at one time.
<P>
<P><h3>To configure for export</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the AutoCAD Main menu, select option 5 (Configure AutoCAD).

<P><LI>From the Configuration menu, select option 5 (Configure Plotter).

<P><LI>Select ADI Plotter.

<P><LI>Select Output Format option 1 (Binary file).

<P><LI>You can accept the default settings for the questions that follow, or
   you can consult your printer manual to optimize the plotter
   specifications for your output device. When you leave AutoCAD, be sure
   to choose Yes when asked if you want to retain your configuration
   settings.
<P>
</OL>After you configure the AutoCAD ADI plotter interface, you can export the
graphic in one of two ways:

<UL><LI>You can plot an existing drawing file to a file by selecting option 3,
   Plot a drawing, from AutoCAD's Main menu. When asked to specify a
   filename, make sure to include an .ADI filename extension (the default
   extension is .PLT).

<LI>You can plot the current drawing to a file by entering the PLOT command
   from the AutoCAD Drawing Editor. When asked to specify a filename, make
   sure to include an .ADI filename extension (the default extension is
   .PLT).
<P>
</UL>The AutoCAD image is now ready to be inserted into a Word 6.0 document.
<P>
<P><h3>CorelDRAW 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
This filter has the following limitations:

<UL><LI>Rotated rounded rectangles are emulated using Circular Arc Center.
<LI>Vector Pattern fills are not fully supported.
<LI>Envelope editing and perspective editing are not supported.
<LI>Bitmaps are not supported.
<LI>Extruded object groups are not fully supported.
<LI>OLE Objects are not supported.
<LI>Line scaling is not supported.
<P>
</UL><h3>HPGL</h3>
 
<P>
This filter supports all HP-GL/2 kernel commands as specified in Hewlett-
Packard's "The HP-GL/2 Reference Guide - A Handbook for Program
Developers." It supports HP-GL/2 command extensions as supported by the
HP7595 Draft Master. To ensure best results when importing HP-GL/2 files
into Word, configure your application to create commands suitable for a
7595 Draft Master plotter. This filter supports display of color images and
assumes the following pen color set:
<P>
<PRE>Pen Number    Color
----------    -----
   Pen 1      Black
   Pen 2      Red
   Pen 3      Green
   Pen 4      Yellow
   Pen 5      Blue
   Pen 6      Magenta
   Pen 7      Cyan
   Pen 8      Orange

</PRE></OL>This filter has the following limitations:

<UL><LI>Polyline Encoding is not supported.
<LI>Color Table commands are not supported.
<P>
</UL><h3>Kodak Photo CD</h3>
 
<P>
By default, this filter imports images at a resolution of 512 x 768
pixels in 256 colors. Use the following procedure to change the default
resolution.
<P>
<P><h3>To set the default resolution</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu in Program Manager, choose Run.

<P><LI>In the Command Line box, type "notepad.exe win.ini" (without the
   quotation marks) and then choose the OK button. This will open WIN.INI
   in Notepad.

<P><LI>If there is not already an [MS Photo CD Import Filter] section in
   WIN.INI, create one. Position the insertion point below all the text in
   the file and type "[MS Photo CD Import Filter]" (without the quotation
   marks).

<P><LI>In the [MS Photo CD Import Filter] section, add the following line,
    where &lt;N&gt; is the default resolution you want to use:
<P>
       DefaultResolution=&lt;N&gt;
<P>
    - The default resolution can be any number between 0 (zero) and 8.
      The resolutions represented by these numbers are listed in the two
      tables following this procedure.
<P>
    - You should use the smallest number possible for your output. A
      larger number means a higher quality image, but slower printing and
      display in Word or any other application.

<P><LI>From the File menu in Notepad, choose Save and then Exit.
<P>
</OL>The following resolutions support 256 colors (8 bit). The quality of the
images is lower, but they display and print more quickly.
<P>
<PRE>   Default
   Resolution
   Number       Resolution
   ----------   ----------

        0       512 x 768 (default)
        1       128 x 192 (small picture)
        2       256 x 384
        3       1024 x 1536
        4       2048 x 3072 (large picture)

</PRE></OL>The following resolutions support 16.7 million colors (24 bit). The quality
of the images is very high, but they display and print very slowly.
<P>
<PRE>   Default
   Resolution
   Number       Resolution
   ----------   ----------
       5        512 x 768 (small picture, high quality)
       6        128 x 192
       7        256 x 384
       8        1024 x 1536(large picture, high quality)

Quattro Pro. It does not support Micrografx PIC or Draw Plus PIC.
