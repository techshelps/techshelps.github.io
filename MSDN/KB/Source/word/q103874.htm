This article contains the text of "Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)
and DDE Questions and Answers," which is available on the Microsoft
FastTips service for Word for Windows. It answers the most commonly
asked questions regarding OLE and DDE in Word for Windows.

<PRE>1. Q. I can't get Microsoft Draw, Graph, WordArt, or Equation Editor
      to run with Word for Windows. What should I do?

   A. Your OLE server applications may not run for any of the
      following three reasons:

      1. The applications are not installed. Run Word Setup again and
         use the Custom Installation option to install Draw, Graph,
         Equation Editor, and WordArt.

      2. The Windows REG.DAT file is damaged. To check your REG.DAT
         file, do the following:

         a. In Windows Program Manager, choose Run from the File
            menu.

         b. Type "regedit /v" (without the quotation marks). If
            REG.DAT is damaged, an error message appears.

         If REG.DAT is damaged, you can restore the correct
         information for Word using the WW20.REG registration file,
         supplied with Word. For information on using WW20.REG, see
         the Word README.DOC.

      3. Your SHELL.DLL file may be the incorrect version or may be
         damaged. Replace your SHELL.DLL file with a new copy from
         the Word Setup disk.

2. Q. When I double-click the Windows icon for Microsoft Draw, Graph,
      or WordArt, I get an error message. Why can't I run Microsoft
      Draw, Graph, or WordArt from an icon?

   A. These OLE server applications are not designed to run as stand-
      alone applications. They run only when you start them from
      inside an OLE client application such as Word. Draw, Graph, and
      WordArt return the following error messages if you try to start
      the application from File Manager or Program Manager:

         Microsoft Draw: Sorry, Microsoft Draw can run only from
         within a destination application.

         Microsoft Graph: This program can only run from within
         another program.

         Microsoft WordArt: Sorry, WordArt can run only from within a
         host application.

3. Q. How can I get my HP PaintJet printer to print my WordArt images
      correctly?

   A. When you print WordArt text on the PaintJet, some characters
      print as unfilled outlines. This most notably occurs on the
      following characters: "B", "e", "o", "i", and "y". This happens
      because WordArt text is composed of metafiles, or graphics. If
      the metafile is too complex, the PaintJet printer driver prints
      only the outline and omits the fill.

      The HP PaintJet driver version 1.01 corrects this problem. To
      obtain this printer driver, contact Hewlett-Packard at (303)
      353-7650. Microsoft has not fully tested this printer driver.

4. Q. I selected the Best Fit font size in WordArt and the text is
      much smaller than I expected. How can I get the text to fill my
      WordArt frame?

   A. When you create a two-line WordArt object using the Best Fit
      point size setting and the Slant Up (More) style setting, the
      WordArt text is significantly smaller than the frame. Do one or
      more of the following to enlarge the WordArt text:

      1. Select a different font.

      2. Instead of Best Fit, select a point size to enlarge the
         text.

      3. Increase the size of the WordArt frame.

5. Q. When I use certain foreign characters in WordArt, they don't
      display in Word. Why does this happen?

   A. WordArt does not support the full range of ANSI characters.
      Unsupported characters are not visible in your Word document,
      so you should not use them in your WordArt objects. This
      limitation becomes a problem when you try to use characters
      from foreign languages. For example, WordArt does not support
      ANSI character code 176, which is an actual key on the French
      keyboard and is used in many French words.

      The following are the ANSI codes for characters NOT supported
      by WordArt:

      ANSI code numbers 164, 166, 167, 171, 172, 173, 175, 176, 177,
      178, 179, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 187, 188, 189, 190, 208,
      215, 222, 240, 247, 254

      To see what these ANSI codes look like, refer to the ANSI table
      in your Microsoft Windows documentation.

6. Q. In WordArt, why does my mouse pointer turn into an hourglass?
      It remains an hourglass for a long time.

   A. In WordArt, if you press SHIFT+INS when there is nothing on the
      Windows Clipboard, the mouse pointer changes to an hourglass
      and remains that way until you move the mouse. This anomaly
      does not affect the functionality of WordArt.

7. Q. My WordArt object did not update. What's wrong?

   A. If you change the text in WordArt and the preview window does
      not update to reflect the change, the "Update Object?" message
      does not appear if you exit WordArt by any method other than
      choosing the OK button. If you choose Close from the Control
      menu, press ESC, or choose the Cancel button, WordArt does not
      update the current object.

      To ensure that your WordArt object updates after you modify it,
      choose the OK button to exit WordArt.

8. Q. I keep getting "DDE timed out" error messages when I create a
      link in my Word document. Can I increase the DDE time-out
      setting that Word uses?

   A. The default time-out setting is 60 seconds for Word version
      2.0. If a DDE process takes longer than 60 seconds, the
      following error message occurs in Word:

         DDE timed out. Continue waiting?

      This sometimes happens when you use the Paste Link command in
      Word to create a link to a complex Excel worksheet.

      If you need to increase the time-out setting, add the following
      line to the [Microsoft Word 2.0] section of your WIN.INI file:

         DDETIMEOUT=n

      There are no spaces in this line. Note that "n" is the number
      of seconds Word waits to receive data from the source
      application during a DDE operation.
