<UL><LI>Microsoft Direct Mail Manager for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a document using the Flyer Wizard or the Postcard Wizard
from Microsoft Direct Mail Manager to create a document in Microsoft Word,
the body of the document is printed as page 1 and the delivery information
is printed as page 2.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The documents that are generated by these wizards have two pages. The first
page contains the "content" of the flyer or postcard and the second page
contains the addressing information. To print these documents so that the
address information prints on the back of the content page, you must print
the documents to a duplex printer (a printer that prints on the front and
the back of paper). Note that duplex printing must be enabled. See the
"More Information" section of this article for information about how to
enable the duplex printing option for your printer.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible, although difficult, to simulate duplex printing on a
printer that does not support it. If your printer does not have the ability
to print on both sides of the paper, follow these steps to simulate duplex
printing:

<OL><P><LI>Merge the information to a new document.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Print.

<P><LI>For Page Range, click All. For Print, click Odd Pages, and then click
   OK.
<P>
   All of the odd pages in the document will be printed.

<P><LI>Remove the output from the printer, turn it over and reinsert it into
   the paper source tray for the printer.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Print. If the back of page 1 will be the first
   page printed, then continue with step 6, otherwise, turn on Reverse
   Print Order by following these steps:
<P>
   a. In the Print dialog box, click Options.
<P>
   b. Turn on Reverse Print Order.
<P>
   c. Click OK.

<P><LI>For Page Range, click All. For Print, click Even Pages, and then click
   OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If your printer supports duplex printing, use the appropriate procedure for
your version of Windows to enable it.
<P>
<P><h3>If You Are Using Windows NT 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
To set duplex printing, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows taskbar, click Start, point to Settings, and click
   Printers.

<P><LI>Right-click the printer you are interested in printing to and click
   Document Defaults on the shortcut menu.

<P><LI>Click the Page Setup tab, change the Orientation from None to Short Side
   and click OK.

<P><LI>Print the documents.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The duplex printing option is located in different places for
different printers. Consult the user's manual for your printer if you have
questions about how to use this feature
<P>
<P><h3>If You Are Using Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
To set duplex printing, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows taskbar, click Start, point to Settings, and click
   Printers.

<P><LI>Right-click the printer you are interested in printing to and click
   Properties on the shortcut menu.

<P><LI>On the Paper dialog tab, click More Options, and change the Orientation
   from None to Short Side, Book, or Flip On Long Side, and click OK.

<P><LI>Print the documents.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The duplex printing option is located in different places for
different printers. Consult the user's manual for your printer if you have
any question about how to use this feature
