WINDOWS

<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 7.0, 7.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are editing a master document and its subdocuments, the following
errors may occur when you save the master document in Word for Windows:
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: Disk is Full or Write-Protected</h3>
 

<UL><LI>"Word cannot save or create this file. Make sure the disk is not write
   protected."
<P>
   -or-

<LI>"The disk is full or too many files are open."
<P>
</UL>Note: The save operation will fail and sometimes one or more of your
subdocuments may be deleted.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2: Insufficient Memory</h3>
 

<UL><LI>"Word has insufficient memory. Do you want to save &lt;filename&gt; as
   RESCUE.DOC? WARNING: This operation will save all text in the master
   document, but not its structure."
<P>
</UL><h3>Case 3: Error Message on Novell network</h3>
 

<UL><LI>"Too many subdocuments open" when working with a master and subdocuments
   on a Novell network.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: Maximum Number of Files or Filesize Exceeded</h3>
 
<P>
The maximum file size and number of subdocuments in a master document
varies depending on your computer and how much memory is available.
Generally, a master document cannot contain more than 20 subdocuments, even
though the "Microsoft Word User's Guide" states on page 534 that the
maximum size of the master document plus its subdocuments is 32 MB and 80
subdocuments.
<P>
These limits relate directly to the number of available Windows file
handles. The Case 1 errors occur when the supply of available Windows file
handles is exhausted.
<P>
When either Case 1 error occurs, Word does not complete the Save operation.
Word begins the Save operation by renaming the subdocuments to temporary
(.TMP) filenames, but when the Save operation fails, Word may not rename
one or more of the subdocument .TMP files back to the original document
name (normally, Word renames the .TMP files back to the original document
name once the Save operation is complete). When you quit Word, some of the
.TMP files may be deleted, which means some subdocuments may be erased.
<P>
IMPORTANT: This problem occurs due to a Windows system file handle
limitation. This problem may not occur in Word 6.0 for other operating
systems, such as Word 6.0 for the Macintosh or Word 6.0 for Windows NT.
For additional information concerning Word 6.0 for the Macintosh, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q131843.htm">Q131843</A></B>
   TITLE     : Too Many Subdocuments Open” in a MacWord 6.0 Master Document


</PRE>The following operations and conditions consume Windows file handles:

<UL><LI>Subdocuments: Each subdocument consumes two or more file handles.

<LI>Editing: Each "dirty" subdocument consumes additional file handles for
   the editing and for the Undo stack.

<LI>Links and Embedded Objects: The Case 1 errors occur frequently in files
   that contain a large number of links and embedded objects.
<P>
</UL><h3>Case 2: Out of System Resources</h3>
 
<P>
The Case 2 error occurs if Word runs out of allotted system resources
during the save operation. If you choose Yes, Word saves the contents of
the document as RESCUE.DOC, but it is a normal Word document instead of a
master document. If you choose the Continue button, you may have
insufficient resources to save any of your work. If you choose No, Word
closes the file and discards the unsaved changes.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 3: Novell Network</h3>
 
<P>
The Novell 32-bit client is out-of-date or damaged.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: Save your Master Document in the RTF Format</h3>
 
<P>
To save your master document after the errors occur, choose Save As from
the File menu and select Rich Text Format (RTF) in the File Save As Type
list.
<P>
Case 1 is partially fixed in Word 6.0c for Windows. In Word 6.0c, a master
document may still exhaust the supply of available Windows file handles.
However, when you save, Word 6.0c checks the number of available file
handles as it performs the save and displays an error message if it cannot
save the next subdocument due to insufficient available file handles. Word
then asks if you want to collapse some of the subdocuments into the master
document. (This is the same as choosing the Remove Subdocument button on
the Master Document toolbar.) If you choose Yes, Word collapses
subdocuments into the master document until enough file handles are
available to save the master document and the remaining subdocuments. By
moving the contents of some subdocuments to the master document, Word 6.0c
prevents the loss of subdocuments that may occur in Word 6.0 and 6.0a.
<P>
For information about obtaining Word 6.0c, please see the following
article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Word 6.0c for Windows: List of Fixed Problems

</PRE><h3>Case 2: Recover Your Work</h3>
 
<P>
Use one of the following methods to recover your work after the Case 2
error occurs:

<UL><LI>If you haven't made many changes in the master document, you can choose
   No when Word prompts you to save as RESCUE.DOC. You can then open and
   re-edit the previous version of the master document.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Choose Yes to save the document as RESCUE.DOC. You can either reformat
   RESCUE.DOC as a master document, or you can use the text of RESCUE.DOC
   to re-edit the previous version of the master document.
<P>
</UL>WARNING: It does not help to repeatedly try to save your document. In fact,
repeated attempts to save the document may increase the likelihood of
losing a subdocument. Instead, use one of the above workarounds to get out
of the current situation, then use the suggestions in the "Troubleshooting"
section below to avoid this problem in the future.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 3: Upgrade the Novell Client</h3>
 
<P>
Upgrade the Novell 32-bit client, or use Microsoft's Netware client in
Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>TROUBLESHOOTING</h2>
 
<P>
Use one or more of the following suggestions to avoid these master document
problems in the future:

<OL><P><LI>First, confirm that you are dealing with a master document limitation.
   Make sure you have sufficient hard disk space, that SHARE.EXE is
   installed and running correctly, and that you do not have a network
   rights conflict.

<P><LI>Use one or more of the following methods to decrease the number of
   subdocuments in your master document:
<P>
   a. Merge some of the subdocuments into a single subdocument.
<P>
   b. Remove the subdocument and add the text of the subdocument to the
<P><PRE>      body of your master document.
</PRE><P>
   c. Use INCLUDE and RD (Referenced Document) fields instead of
<P><PRE>      subdocuments.
</PRE><P>
   d. Edit the subdocuments outside the master document.
<P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      In the master document, edit one subdocument at a time, then
      save before you edit the next subdocument.
</PRE>
<P><LI>When you are working on the master document in Word, close extra windows
   to increase the available memory.

<P><LI>If you are running Word 6.0 or 6.0a, obtain the Word 6.0c upgrade.
<P>
