<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists third-party extensions that are known to conflict with
the operation of Word for the Macintosh.
<P>
For information on troubleshooting extension conflicts and isolating a
problem extension, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q122009.htm">Q122009</A></B>
   TITLE     : WD6x: Optimizing Your Mac System Configuration

</PRE>You can diagnose extension conflicts with Word by pressing the SHIFT key
while the machine is booting. The first dialog box will display:
<P>
<PRE>   Welcome to the Macintosh
   Extensions Off

</PRE>Start Word and try to reproduce the problem. If the problem with Word is
resolved, it is probably a problem with a third-party extension.
<P>
<P><h2>ADOBE TYPE REUNION 1.1, 1.2</h2>
 
<P>
Manufacturer: Adobe Systems, Inc.
<P>
There are three known problems that can occur when you run Word 6.0 for the
Macintosh with Adobe Type Reunion 1.1 or 1.2 installed:
<P>
<P><h3>Font Grouping</h3>
 
<P>
Adobe Type Reunion 1.1 or 1.2 may fail to group the fonts in the Font list
on the Formatting toolbar in Word. This happens because the Recently Used
File (MRU, or Most Recently Used) List prevents Type Reunion from modifying
the font list. Use either of the following two workarounds for this
problem:
<P>
Workaround 1:
<P>
If you turn on the NoFontMRUList setting in your ToolsAdvancedSettings, 
Adobe Type Reunion groups the fonts in the Font list. Use the following 
procedure to turn on this Advanced Setting in Word:
<P>
<PRE>   a. On the Tools menu, click Macro.

   b. From the Macros Available In list, select Word Commands.

   c. In the Macro Name box, select ToolsAdvancedSettings, and then click 
      Run.

   d. In the Option box, type "NoFontMRUList" (without the quotation 
      marks).

   e. In the Setting box, type "Y" (without the quotation marks). Click 
      Set and then click OK.

</PRE>Workaround 2:
<P>
Adobe Type Reunion functions correctly if you add a Font menu to your Word 
6.0 menu bar. Use the following steps to add a Font menu in Word:
<P>
<PRE>   a. Open the 5.1 Upgrade template, which is located in the Macros folder.

   b. On the Tools menu, click Macro.
 
   c. Run the macro AddFontMenu.

   d. Choose Yes to confirm the menu change.

</PRE>For additional information about Adobe Type Reunion, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q121378.htm">Q121378</A></B>
   TITLE     : Adobe Type Reunion Not Functional in Word 6.0 Ribbon

</PRE><h3>Font Drop-Down List</h3>
 
<P>
With Adobe Type Reunion installed on your computer, if you move the
Formatting toolbar to a location other than its anchored position at the
top of the Word screen, Word may continue to display the Font drop-down
list in the original location--that is, where it would appear if the
Formatting toolbar were still anchored at the top of the Word screen. In
other words, the Font drop-down list does not seem to be "attached" to the
Font box on the Formatting toolbar if that toolbar is floating or anchored
elsewhere.
<P>
This happens if the NoFontMRUList setting is turned off in your
Word Settings(6) file. To work around this problem, turn on the
NoFontMRUList setting using the instructions in Workaround 1 of the "Font
Grouping" section in this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Incorrect Font Applied</h3>
 
<P>
In Word, if Adobe Type Reunion 1.1 or 1.2 is running and the MS LineDraw
TrueType font is installed on your computer, Word may apply the incorrect
font when you select a font from the Font box on the Formatting toolbar. To
resolve this problem, remove the MS LineDraw TrueType font from your Fonts
folder and restart your computer.
<P>
This problem was corrected in Word version 6.0.1.
<P>
<P><h2>BIG THESAURUS 2.0.1 AND COACH PRO 4.0.1</h2>
 
<P>
Manufacturer: Deneba Software, (305) 596-5644.
<P>
An error may occur in Word if you select text for a search in Big Thesaurus
or Coach Pro. Deneba Software is aware of this problem. You can contact
Deneba at the above phone number regarding compatibility issues with Word
6.0 for the Macintosh.
<P>
As a workaround to this problem Deneba suggests moving the Deneba
Dioctionaries to the root folder of Word. Updating to Coach Pro version
4.0.2 corrects this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>GREG'S BUTTONS 3.1.2 (SHAREWARE)</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using Greg's Buttons 3.1.2 when you start Word, the following
error message may occur:
<P>
<PRE>   The application was unable to start due to an error. Please contact
   customer support.

</PRE>After you choose OK, Word may hang (stop responding). To resolve this
problem, obtain a later version of Greg's Buttons that is compatible with
Word.
<P>
<P><h2>MACINTOSH EASY OPEN 1.1</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running the 68K edition of Word 6.0 for the Macintosh,
Macintosh Easy Open 1.1 may not list Microsoft Word as an available
application when you open non-native files (such as text, RTF, or other
file formats).
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the 68K edition of Word 6.0
for the Macintosh. This problem was corrected in Word version 6.0.1 for the
Macinthosh.
<P>
<P><h2>NOW UTILITIES 4.0.1</h2>
 
<P>
Manufacturer: Now Software
<P>
There are three known problems that may occur when you run Word 6.0 for the
Macintosh with Now Utilities 4.0.1 installed. Below is a list of the
problems and the Now Utilities modules that are affected:
<P>
<P><h3>Now Menus</h3>
 
<P>
With the Now Menus module installed, the Undo (COMMAND+Z) and Repeat
(COMMAND+Y) commands may not work in Word.
<P>
The resolution to this problem is to upgrade to Now Utilities 5.0.1
<P>
<P><h3>Super Boomerang</h3>
 
<P>
If you perform a Re-Launch operation in Super Boomerang, Word may display
the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Do you want to revert to the saved '&lt;filename&gt;'?

</PRE><h3>WYSIWYG Menus</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>With the WYSIWYG Menus Now module active, sometimes more than one font
   at a time is selected on the Font menu (a selected font has a check
   mark next to the font name).
<P>
   NOTE: To add the Font menu in Word 6.0, open the 5.1 Upgrade template,
   located in the Macro folder, and run the AddFontMenu macro.
<P>
   IMPORTANT: If you run the AddFontMenu macro with Now's WYSIWYG Menus
   enabled, fonts whose names end with the word "Chancery" may be
   truncated. To avoid this problem, disable WYSIWYG Menus and restart
   your Macintosh before you run the AddFontMenu macro in Word.

<P><LI>In addition, if you open the Font menu using the Menu Bar shortcut key
   combination (F10 or COMMAND+TAB), WYSIWYG Menus does not display the
   font names as they will print. For example, a font name such as Times
   does not display in the Times font.
<P>
</OL><h3>More Information</h3>
 
<P>
Now Software has been notified and is investigating the problems. For more
information, contact Now Software at the following address and phone
number:
<P>
<PRE>   Now Software
   520 SW Harrison Suite 435
   Portland, OR 97201
   (800) 237-2078 or (503) 274-2800

</PRE></OL><h2>NOW UTILITIES 5.0</h2>
 
<P>
Manufacturer: Now Software.
<P>
Word has experienced crashes, hangs, and application errors with Now
Utilities 5.0. Other programs are frequently affected in the same fashion.
<P>
According to Now Software, the preferences files for Now can become corrupt
when upgrading from Now version 4.0 to version 5.0.
<P>
To work around these problems, you must delete the Now Utilities
preferences files. It is important that you remove these preferences files
in the manner described below:

<OL><P><LI>Start (boot) your computer with extensions off (this is critical).

<P><LI>Drag the SuperBoomerang Prefs and Now Toolbox Prefs to the trash.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
</OL>If you don't boot with extensions off, the extensions will remain in memory
until you shut down or restart, at which point the information will be
written back to the preferences files. This gives you the same corrupt
preferences files as if you didn't start with extensions off.
<P>
Now Software has confirmed that these problems occur with corrupt Now
Utilities preferences files and is investigating the problems. For more
information, contact Now Software at the following address and phone
number:
<P>
<PRE>   Now Software
   520 SW Harrison Suite 435
   Portland, OR  97201
   (800) 237-2078 or (503) 274-2800

</PRE></OL><h2>OPTIMEM (EARLIER THAN 1.5.6G)</h2>
 
<P>
Manufacturer: Jump Development Group, (412) 681-2692.
<P>
If you run a version of Optimem earlier than 1.5.6g, Word may hang (stop
responding) under low memory conditions. Optimem 1.5.6g, which is currently
available from Jump Development Group, corrects this problem. Jump
Development Group has released OptiMem 2.0 which should optimize memory
more efficiently when you run Microsoft Desktop Applications.
<P>
<P><h2>POPCHAR 2.7.1 (SHAREWARE)</h2>
 
<P>
If you are running PopChar 2.7.1 with Word 6.0 for the Macintosh, PopChar
may fail to display the selected font in the Font list on the Formatting
toolbar. This is a known problem for which we have no workaround.
<P>
<P><h2>SUPER ATM VERSION 3.6</h2>
 
<P>
Super ATM version 3.6 slows the normal processing time for Word 6.0.
Keyboard input and menu selections are affected. The only available
workaround is to update to a later version of Super ATM.
