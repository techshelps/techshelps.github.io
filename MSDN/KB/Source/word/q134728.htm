<P><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
The information in this Application Note applies to Microsoft Word
versions 6.x for Windows, Microsoft Word versions 6.0 and 6.0.1 for
the Macintosh(R), Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows NT(TM), and
Microsoft Word versions 7.0 for Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h3>Abstract</h3>
 
<P>
The Macro Virus Protection tool is a free tool that installs a set of
protective macros in Word. These macros detect suspicious Word
documents and alert you if they find a Word virus. You are then given
the choice of opening the file without its macros, ensuring that no
viruses are transmitted.
<P>
In addition, the tool also contains an updated version of the scanning
code for the Concept Virus and can be used to scan your hard disk for
Word files that contain the Concept Virus.
<P>
This Application Note includes two files: Readme.doc and Scanprot.dot.
Readme.doc contains complete information on how to install the Macro
Virus Protection tool. It also answers common questions about the tool
and about macro viruses. Scanprot.dot contains the Macro Virus Protection
tool. Look at Readme.doc for instructions on how to use the Scanprot.dot
file.
<P>
