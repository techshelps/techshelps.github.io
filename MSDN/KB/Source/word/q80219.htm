The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information is reprinted from the Adobe Type Manager (R)
1.15 Release Notes. Adobe Type Manager (ATM) is a registered trademark
of Adobe Systems Incorporated. Copyright 1983-1991 Adobe System
Incorporated. All Rights Reserved. Patents Pending.
<P>
The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability. For more information, contact
Adobe Type Manager's technical support at (408) 986-6530.
<P>
Note:  According to Adobe Technical Support, versions of ATM prior to
2.0 have not been tested and are not guaranteed compatibility under
Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h2>Application-Specific Information</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Ami Professional 1.2</h3>
 
<P>
Twelve-point Tms Rmn text may not enlarge in Ami's Enlarged view. This
problem also occurs without ATM. To work around this problem, use
Times instead of Tms Rmn. If you use Ami Professional's Pair Kerning
option, do not activate that option until you are ready to print.
<P>
<P><h3>Corel Draw 1.21 &amp; 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
These versions of Corel Draw do not support ATM.
<P>
<P><h3>PageMaker 3.01 &amp; 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
For the best results with ATM, set the Above limits for Vector text
and Stretch text in PageMaker's Preferences dialog box to 600 pixels
(the maximum) for PageMaker version 3.01 and 10,000 pixels for version
4.0. Earlier versions of PageMaker had a maximum of 127 pixels.
<P>
Underline and strikethrough lines may appear broken if you activate
automatic kerning and/or justification options. This occurs because of
the way PageMaker handles automatic kerning. Turning paired kerning
off corrects this problem.
<P>
<P><h3>PowerPoint 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
For the best results with small point sizes on the screen, remove the
"Small Fonts" font using the Fonts option in the Windows Control
Panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Toolbook 1.0</h3>
 
<P>
Text may appear jagged when printed from Toolbook. This is because
Toolbook performs its own scaling of the screen image for printing,
rather than using Windows (or ATM) font facilities.
<P>
<P><h3>Ventura Publisher Windows Edition 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
Backspacing at the end of a line sometimes causes the line to move
down the screen one line per backspace. This problem also occurs
without ATM.
<P>
In Reduced View, the fonts Helvetica and Times do not display
correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>Word for Windows 1.1</h3>
 
<P>
The typeface used in the ruler and in the status bar may not be
Helvetica. This is normal; Word for Windows uses the first variable
pitch sans-serif font available in the [Fonts] section of your ATM.INI
file.
<P>
The bullet character displays and prints as a lowercase "o." This is a
feature of Word for Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Excel 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
When printing to a PCL printer, such as the HP LaserJet Series II,
make sure that the print resolution in the printer setup menu is set
to 300 dots per inch (dpi).
<P>
If you are using rotated text in graphs, you must remove the aliases
for the Roman and Modern fonts. See "Window Vector Fonts" below.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows Vector Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
ATM substitutes its scalable Times and Helvetica for the Roman and
Modern Windows fonts respectively. This eliminates the "stick-figure"
appearance of the Windows fonts. If you do not want ATM to make this
substitution, delete the following two lines from the [Aliases]
section of your ATM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   Roman=Times
   Modern=Helvetica
