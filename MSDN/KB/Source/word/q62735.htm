The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Neither the Medical nor Legal dictionary can be opened through the
Spelling dialog box by choosing their names with the File Open command
in Microsoft Word version 4.0. To access either the Medical or Legal
dictionary without making it the default dictionary, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Word.

<P><LI>Locate the dictionary you wish to open and double-click it, or click
   it once and choose Open from the File menu (this launches the Word
   application and opens an untitled document).

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open, and select the document to be spell
   checked.

<P><LI>From the Utilities menu, choose Spelling. The dictionary that will
   be used will be the one that was opened in step 1. This dictionary
   will remain the active dictionary during the current Word session.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If Word is running when the Medical or Legal dictionary is
double-clicked on the desktop, the error "Some 'Microsoft Word'
Documents could not be opened or printed. Please open them from within
the application" appears. If this error occurs, switch to Word, quit
the application, then follow the above instructions.
<P>
The Medical or Legal dictionary can be set as the default dictionary
by renaming it "MS Dictionary". To do this, the standard MS Dictionary
may also need to be renamed. Either dictionary can also be made the
default dictionary by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Word, if it is running.

<P><LI>Move the MS Dictionary from the folder it's in to a folder that
   doesn't contain Word (except the System Folder).

<P><LI>Load Word.

<P><LI>From the Utilities menu, choose Spelling.

<P><LI>You will be prompted to locate the MS Dictionary.

<P><LI>Move to the folder containing the dictionary that you want to be
   the default dictionary and select it. (Note: The dialog box will
   show the Medical and Legal dictionaries along with the MS
   Dictionary.)

<P><LI>Once the desired dictionary is selected, it will become the
   default dictionary.
<P></OL>
