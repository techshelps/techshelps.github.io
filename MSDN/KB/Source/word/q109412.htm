The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0, 7.0a
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how Word verifies your eligibility to upgrade from a
earlier version of Word or another eligible word processing application.
This process, known as "compliance checking," confirms that you are using
Word 6.0 in compliance with applicable copyright laws.
<P>
At the end of this article there is a "Troubleshooting" section that
contains information about compliance checking problems when you install
Word 6.0 for the Macintosh over Word 5.1 for the Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two levels of compliance checking: strict and lenient. Strict
compliance checking prevents you from installing the application if you
cannot verify your eligibility to upgrade. Lenient compliance checking
searches for or requests verification, but it does not prevent you from
installing the application if you do not provide appropriate verification.
<P>
The U.S. (domestic) edition of Word for Windows uses lenient compliance
checking, which means you can install Word even if you do not provide the
requested verification. Word for Windows 95 uses strict compliance
checking. To upgrade you must either have a previous version of Word
installed, or have Disk 1 from the earlier version disk set.
<P>
All international versions of Word 6.0 for Windows use strict compliance
checking. To upgrade an international version of Word, you must either have
Word installed, or have Disk 1 from the earlier version disk set.
<P>
<P><h3>Lenient Compliance Checking</h3>
 
<P>
When you install the Word 6.0 upgrade (U.S. edition), Setup searches your
system for a earlier version of Word or another eligible word processing
application. If Setup finds no eligible application, it requests that you
insert Disk 1 (the Setup disk) from an eligible word processing package.
You can either insert an appropriate disk or continue installing Word. If
you continue without providing an appropriate disk or hard disk location,
Setup displays another message to notify you that you have not provided
proper verification. If you again choose to continue without providing an
appropriate disk or hard disk location, Setup continues and no further
compliance checking messages appear.

</PRE><h2>TROUBLESHOOTING</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes when you install the U.S. edition of Word 6.0 for the Macintosh
over a previous installation of Word 5.1 for the Macintosh (U.S. edition),
Setup does not find your Word 5.1 installation. Setup prompts you to insert
Disk 1 from an eligible word processing package.
<P>
This may happen even though you have a valid installation of Word 5.1 on
your system. It can also happen if you removed Word 5.1 and then rebuilt
your Macintosh desktop.
<P>
In either case, to continue installing Word 6.0, choose the Cancel button
in the compliance-checking dialog boxes.
