The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Because Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Word for Windows use the ANSI
character set, character sets available from your printer (also called
symbol sets) may not be directly accessible or viewable; however, you
can print most of these characters by using a PRINT field in a Word
for Windows document.
<P>
Some characters, such as the printer control characters, are not
accessible and cannot be printed. Word usually differentiates these
characters from accessible characters by displaying them in a
different color.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To access the printer's character sets, you need to know the escape
sequence for the character set you want to access, the escape sequence
for the default character set of the printer, and the character number
of the symbol you want to print. This information is usually found in
the back of your printer manual.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Access Printer Character Sets with a PRINT Field</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Place the insertion point at the beginning of the line in which you
   want the special character to appear.

<P><LI>Press CTRL+F9 to insert a field code. Between the field braces,
   type "print" (without the quotation marks), followed by the escape
   sequence of the character set you want to access. Place the escape
   sequence within quotation marks. For example, on the Hewlett-Packard
   (HP) LaserJet IIIp printer, the escape sequence to access the PC-8
   character set is "ESC(10U". The Word for Windows PRINT field appears
   on-screen as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {print "|(10U"}
</PRE><P>
   Notes: 
   
   The | character appears as a box when using Microsoft Windows 3.1x
   and 95. See the section How To Include the "ESC" (|) Portion of Code
   later in this article as to how to insert that symbol into Microsoft
   Word.
<P>
   The PRINT field codes must appear on the left margin so that
   they do not send linefeeds to the printer.

<P><LI>Position the insertion point where you want the special character
   to print in the sentence. Press ALT+0 plus the character's decimal
   value on the numeric keypad (with NUM LOCK turned on). Note that the
   screen displays either a vertical line or the ANSI equivalent symbol
   because the screen font displays only ANSI characters. For example,
   to print the "smiley" face symbol (available in the PC-8 character
   set on an HP LaserJet IIIp printer), type "ALT+0001" (without
   the quotation marks). A vertical line appears on the screen, as
   shown in the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {print "|(10U"}This is the smiley face symbol for the
      PC-8 character set |.
</PRE><P>
   Note: The vertical bar that follows the above text indicates the
   position where the smiley face symbol prints.

<P><LI>At the beginning of the next line, press CTRL+F9 to insert a field.
   Between the braces, type "print" (without the quotation marks)
   followed by the escape sequence (within quotation marks) of the
   default character set. For example, to return to the default
   character set of the HP LaserJet IIIp printer (Roman8), you need the
   sequence "ESC(8U". (See the section How To Include the "ESC" (|)
   Portion of Code later in this article as to how to insert that
   symbol into Microsoft Word.)
<P>
   {print "|(10U"}This is the "smiley" face symbol from the
   PC-8 character set |.
   {print "|(8U"}
<P>
</OL><h2>How To Include the "ESC" (|) Portion of Code</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Word 1.x</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word for Windows version 1.x, you can enter the escape
sequence into the PRINT field by:

<OL><P><LI>Click Field on the Insert menu and then select Print. Click OK.
<P>
   or
<P>
   Press CTRL+F9 to enter field braces into the document and then
   type PRINT inside the field braces.

<P><LI>Type ALT+027 key combination in the Field Code box. The 027 needs
   to be entered using the Numeric Keypad.
<P>
</OL>After the entire escape sequence to access the particular printer's
chanracter set is typed, the result will show as {PRINT |(10U"} on
the screen if your Field Codes are showing.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Word 2.x-7.x</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word for Windows version 2.x-7.x, you must enter the
escape sequence directly on-screen by:

<OL><P><LI>Press CTRL+F9 to enter Field braces into the document

<P><LI>Type PRINT inside the Field Braces.
<P>
</OL>After the entire escape sequence to access the particular printer's
chanracter set is typed, the result will show as {PRINT |(10U"} on
the screen if your Field Codes are showing.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Word 97</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word 97 for Windows version, you must enter the escape
sequence directly on-screen by:

<OL><P><LI>Click Field on the Insert menu and then select Print from the
   Field Names: list. Click OK.
<P>
   or
<P>
   Press CTRL+F9 to enter field braces into the document and then
   type PRINT inside the field braces.

<P><LI>Press the Spacebar to enter a space after the PRINT field and then
   type 27" for the escape code.
<P>
</OL>After the entire escape sequence to access the particular printer's
chanracter set is typed, the result will show as {PRINT 27"(10U"} on
the screen if your Field Codes are showing.
