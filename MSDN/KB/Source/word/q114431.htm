                                  =======

</PRE>This article explains how bin selection is handled when using the Hewlett-
Packard (HP) LaserJet 4 with Word for Windows. If the bins of the printer
are not correctly configured using the front control panel on the printer,
several problems, including the following, may occur:

<UL><LI>Each time you print an envelope to the manual feed bin, rather than
   automatically pulling the envelope from the manual feed bin, the printer
   goes offline, and you must press the Continue button on the printer to
   force it to pull the envelope.

<LI>When you print an envelope, the printer pulls the envelope from a
   different tray than you want it to.

<LI>When you print a custom paper size, the printer pulls paper from the
   letter cassette rather than the manual feed bin.

<LI>When you print a custom paper size, rather than automatically pulling
   the paper from the manual feed bin, the printer goes offline, and you
   must press the Continue button on the front panel of the printer to
   continue.

<LI>When you print legal size paper, the printer either goes offline or
   pulls paper from a different tray than you want it to.
<P>
<PRE>                             MORE INFORMATION
                             ================

</PRE></UL><h2>BIN TERMINOLOGY</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Paper Cassette</h3>
 
<P>
The LaserJet 4 has a slot for a paper tray near the base of the front of
the printer. You can insert a letter tray that holds letter-size paper, or
you can insert a legal tray that holds legal-size paper. There is also an
optional universal tray, which uses an adjusting knob to set the paper size
available. Because the physical size of these trays differs, the printer
has internal sensors that can detect what type of tray it is (letter or
legal) and therefore know what type of paper is being loaded into this
slot. With the optional universal tray, the paper size is detected through
the position of the paper-size adjusting knob. This is called "auto-
detecting" the paper size.
<P>
<P><h3>The Multipurpose (or MP) Tray</h3>
 
<P>
The MP tray is a door that drops down on the front of the printer above the
paper cassette. The door can drop down a level and has sliders so that you
can put different sizes of paper in it. It looks like a manual-feed tray;
however, unlike a manual-feed tray, with the MP tray, you can load a small
stack of paper (100 sheets) instead of only one sheet at a time.
<P>
Because you can load 100 sheets of paper, you can use the MP tray as a
second paper source. This is why HP calls it a multipurpose tray rather
than a manual-feed tray.
<P>
NOTE: Because you can put any size paper in the MP tray, you must configure
it to correctly match the paper you are using. (This is done on the control
panel on the printer.)
<P>
<P><h3>Optional Envelope Feeder</h3>
 
<P>
This is an optional box that is hooked into the front of the printer. It
holds envelopes only.
<P>
NOTE: Many people think they have an envelope feeder, when, in fact, they
are using an MP tray. Finding out whether you have a true envelope feeder
or are using the MP tray to load envelopes is very important--this
determines whether you have two or three possible paper sources.
<P>
The printer can detect when an optional envelope feeder is installed
because this device hooks into a special spot on the front of the printer.
Although the printer can tell an envelope feeder is installed, it cannot
tell what size envelope is loaded in the feeder. The envelope size also
must be configured using the front control panel of the printer.
<P>
Once the feeder is installed, you have 15 seconds to change the envelope
size; otherwise, the printer selects the default value (COM 10).
<P>
<P><h3>Optional Lower Cassette</h3>
 
<P>
This is an optional tray that the printer sits on top of. It holds up to
500 sheets of paper. There are two types of lower cassettes available:
standard, which supports letter, A4, and executive; and universal, which
supports letter, legal, A4, and executive.
<P>
<P><h2>HOW DOES THE HP LASERJET 4 DETERMINE WHICH BIN TO PRINT FROM?</h2>
 
<P>
This section explains how the HP LaserJet 4 determines which bin to use
when you print from Word under a variety of configurations and scenarios.
<P>
<P><h3>Configuration: No Optional Envelope Feeder or Lower Cassette Installed</h3>
 
<P>
If your printer does not have an optional envelope feeder or lower cassette
installed, the two possible paper sources are the MP tray and the paper
cassette:
<P>
<PRE>   MP Tray              You tell the printer what size paper is loaded
                        using the Paper Size button on the control panel on
                        the front of the printer.

   Paper Cassette       Tells the printer what size paper it contains
                        (letter or legal).

</PRE><h3>Scenario 1: Print Envelope from Word</h3>
 
<P>
Printer Configuration: Printer contains letter paper cassette, and the MP
tray is configured for legal size paper.
<P>
<PRE>Problem:    When you print a COM 10 size envelope from Word, the printer
            displays the following message: [MP LOAD COM 10]. This error
            occurs because the printer does not contain a COM 10 paper
            source. The printer cannot pull from the paper cassette because
            it tells the printer it contains letter size paper. Further, it
            cannot pull from the MP tray because you configured that tray
            for legal size paper. The printer goes offline and requests the
            correct size paper.

</PRE>Resolution: Load up to ten envelopes in the MP tray and press the Continue
<PRE>            button to begin printing. If you want to print more than ten
            envelopes without pressing the Continue button, reconfigure the
            MP tray for envelopes. This resolves the conflict between the
            requested and available paper sizes.

</PRE><h3>Scenario 2: Print Envelope from Word</h3>
 
<P>
Printer Configuration: Printer contains the letter cassette and the MP tray
is configured for COM 10 size envelopes.
<P>
NOTE: With this configuration, when you send a COM 10 envelope from Word,
the printer pulls an envelope from the MP tray without going offline or
displaying any error message. In other words, everything works correctly.
<P>
<PRE>Problem:    If you print a legal size page from Word and select MP Tray for
            the Paper Source setting, the printer goes offline and displays
            the [MP FEED LEGAL] error. The printer assumes the MP tray
            contains envelopes, so it prompts you to remove the envelopes
            and add legal paper to the tray. Similarly, if you print a
            legal size page from Word and select Upper Cassette, Lower
            Cassette, or Auto Select for the Paper Source setting, the
            printer goes offline and displays the [PC LOAD LEGAL] error.
            The printer assumes you want to print from the legal paper
            cassette, so it prompts you to remove the letter paper cassette
            and insert the legal paper cassette.

</PRE>Resolution: Either place a legal size sheet in the MP tray or switch to the
<PRE>            legal paper cassette and then press the Continue button. To
            avoid the error message altogether, either configure the MP
            tray for legal size paper or insert the legal cassette before
            you print.

</PRE><h3>Configuration: Envelope Feeder Installed, No Lower Cassette Installed</h3>
 
<P>
The three possible paper sources are the MP tray, paper cassette, and the
optional envelope feeder:
<P>
<PRE>   MP Tray              You tell the printer what size paper is loaded
                        using the Paper Size button on the control panel on
                        the front of the printer.

   Paper Cassette       Tells the printer what size paper it contains
                        (letter or legal).

   Envelope Feeder      You tell the printer what size envelopes are
                        loaded using the Paper Size button on the
                        printer.

</PRE><h3>Scenario 1: Print Legal Paper</h3>
 
<P>
Printer Configuration: Printer contains the letter paper cassette, the MP
tray is configured for legal size paper, and the envelope feeder is
configured for COM 10 size envelopes.
<P>
NOTE: With this configuration, when you print a COM 10 envelope to the
envelope feeder, the printer pulls an envelope from the envelope feeder
without going offline or displaying any error message. In other words,
everything works correctly.
<P>
<PRE>Problem:    If you print a COM 10 envelope with the Paper Source set to
            Manual Feed, the printer goes offline and displays the [ME FEED
            COM 10] error, even though the envelope feeder contains the
            correct size envelope. To continue, remove the legal paper from
            the MP tray, place a COM 10 envelope in the MP tray, and press
            the Online button to print.

            Similarly, if you print a Monarch size envelope from Word with
            the Paper Source set to Envelope Feeder, the printer goes
            offline and displays the [EE LOAD MONARCH] error to prompt you
            to put a Monarch size envelope in the envelope feeder. Word
            does not pull an envelope from the envelope feeder because it
            is set for COM 10 size envelopes, not Monarch. If you place a
            Monarch envelope in the feeder, the printer resumes printing
            automatically. (You do not have to press the Continue button.)

</PRE>Resolution: You can either put a Monarch size envelope in the feeder, or
<PRE>            you can put the envelope in the MP tray and press the Continue
            button on the printer. If you want to avoid the error message,
            reconfigure your envelope feeder for Monarch size envelopes.

</PRE><h2>BIN SELECTION FLOWCHART</h2>
 
<P>
Below is a flow chart that provides a visual representation of the bin
selection process on the HP LaserJet 4. Remember that when you select Paper
Source and Paper settings in Word, the printer complies with that request
only if you configured the printer for the requested paper size and source
as well. In other words, the printer configuration must match the Word
settings to print without displaying an error. This behavior is consistent
with the bin-selection functionality of all HP multibin printers.
<P>
IMPORTANT: If you change the MP Tray setting from CASS to FIRST using the
menu on the control panel of the printer, the printer first checks the MP
tray for the correct paper size instead of first checking the lower trays.
<P>

</PRE><h2>GLOSSARY OF PRINTER PANEL [FEED...] MESSAGES</h2>
 
<P>
The errors on the printer usually display the paper size it is trying to
print and the bin it is trying to print from. Below is a list of the
printer error messages, along with the causes and troubleshooting methods
you can use for each.
<P>
<P><h3>EE LOAD &lt;Envelope Size&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>Meaning:              The printer received a request for an envelope that
                      is not loaded in the optional envelope feeder.

</PRE>Troubleshooting Tips: The printer has an envelope feeder, but it is
<PRE>                      configured for an envelope size that does not match
                      the Paper Size setting in Word.

Resolution:           Place the envelope in the MP tray and press the
                      Continue button or reconfigure the envelope feeder to
                      match the envelope size you want to print.

</PRE><h3>MF FEED &lt;Paper Size&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Possible &lt;paper size&gt; settings are Letter, Legal, Exec, and A4.
<P>
<PRE>Meaning:              Word requested manual feed bin as the paper source.

</PRE>Troubleshooting Tips: - If the error occurs even though the MP tray
<PRE>                        contains the correct size paper, you need to change
                        the Paper Source setting in Word from Manual Feed
                        to MP Tray (this assumes your MP tray is configured
                        for the requested paper size). Alternatively, you
                        can place the paper in the MP tray and press the
                        Online button (in other words, feed the paper
                        manually).

                      - If you are using a standard Page Size setting and
                        then adjusting the margin settings to print on a
                        custom paper size, you need to configure your MP
                        tray for the requested paper size. In addition,
                        make sure the Page Size setting in Word matches the
                        MP tray paper size setting.

</PRE><h3>ME FEED &lt;Envelope Size&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Possible &lt;envelope size&gt; settings are COM 10, Monarch, DL, C5, and
B5.
<P>
<PRE>Meaning:             The printer prompts you to place an envelope in the MP
                     tray, even though the envelope feeder contains the
                     correct size envelope.

</PRE>Troubleshooting Tip: The Paper Source setting in Word is Manual Feed, so
<PRE>                     the printer does not automatically pull the correct
                     size envelope from the envelope feeder.

Resolutions:         - Place the envelope in the MP tray and press the
                       Online button.

                     -or-

                     - Change the Paper Source setting in Word to MP Tray
                       and configure the MP tray for the correct envelope
                       size.

                     -or-

                     - Change the Paper Source setting in Word to Envelope
                       Feeder and configure the envelope feeder for the
                       correct envelope size. To use this method in Word
                       2.x, you must also select the Envelope Feeder Has
                       Been Installed option under the Print category in
                       the Options dialog box. (To access this dialog box,
                       choose Options from the Tools menu.)

</PRE><h3>&lt;xx&gt; LOAD &lt;Envelope or Paper Size&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: The following are the possible settings for the variables in the
above error message:

<UL><LI>&lt;xx&gt; can be MP (multipurpose tray), PC (paper cassette), or LC (optional
   lower cassette)

<LI>&lt;Paper size&gt; can be Letter, Legal, Exec, or A4

<LI>&lt;Envelope size&gt; can be COM 10, Monarch, DL, C5, or B5
<P>
<PRE>Meaning:             The printer received a request for a paper or envelope
                     size that is not available in the printer.

</PRE></UL>Troubleshooting Tip: The error message indicates the paper size and source
<PRE>                     Word requested. This size should match the page size
                     of your document, except when you are creating a
                     custom page size using a standard Page Size setting
                     and adjusted margins. If the printer tray contains the
                     correct paper size, that tray is probably not
                     correctly configured.

Resolution:          Load the correct paper into the MP tray and press the
                     Continue button, or configure the MP tray for the
                     paper size it contains.

</PRE><h2>HOW TO CONFIGURE THE MP TRAY</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: This procedure also appears on page 3-25 of the "LaserJet 4 User's
Guide."

<P><LI>Press the Online button to switch the printer online.
<P>
</OL><h2>HOW TO CONFIGURE THE OPTIONAL ENVELOPE FEEDER</h2>
 
<P>
When the optional envelope feeder is installed, the printer briefly
displays [EE TRAY = COM 10] when you turn on the printer. After about 15
seconds, the display changes to [00 READY]. To reconfigure the envelope
feeder, you must make the changes before the display changes to [00 READY].
If the display changes to [00 READY] before you reconfigure the envelope
feeder, turn off the printer then turn it on again (or remove the envelopes
from the feeder and then replace them) to display the [EE TRAY = COM 10]
message again.

<OL><P><LI>Make sure the envelope feeder is properly installed.

<P><LI>Restart the printer by turning it off and then on.
<P>
   -or-
<P>
   Reset the envelope feeder by removing the envelopes from the envelope
   feeder and then putting them back.
<P>
   The printer displays [EE TRAY = COM10] (or another envelope size).

<P><LI>On the front panel of the printer, press the +/- button until your
   envelope size displays. The possible choices are COM 10, Monarch, C5,
   DL, and B5.

<P><LI>When your envelope size is displayed, press the Enter key to lock your
   choice.

<P><LI>Press the Online button.

</OL><h2>SAMPLE PRINTING SCENARIOS</h2>
 
<P>
This section describes the results of a wide variety of printing

</PRE><h2>PRINTING CUSTOM PAPER SIZES</h2>
 
<P>
Word generally creates custom paper sizes by internally selecting the
closest paper size supported by the printer and increasing the margins so
that the text prints in the correct location on the supported paper size.
<P>
The following steps describe what usually happens when you print a custom
paper size from Word:

<OL><P><LI>Word formats the document for letter size paper and increases the margin
   settings to create the correct print area on the custom size paper.
<P>
   The printer does not know that you want to print on custom size paper;
   it knows only that Word requested letter size paper.

<P><LI>The printer looks for letter size paper.

<P><LI>If the MP tray is configured for letter size paper, the printer
   automatically prints from the MP tray. (Frequently, your MP tray already
   contains letter size paper, so the document prints correctly and no
   printer error occurs.)
<P>
   On the other hand, if your MP tray is configured for a different size
   paper, the printer searches the other paper sources and prints from
   there if it finds the correct size paper. This usually prints the
   document in the wrong position on the page.
<P>
</OL>Resolution: Configure your MP tray for letter size paper.
<P>
<P><h2>HINTS FOR TROUBLESHOOTING BIN SELECTION PROBLEMS</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Make sure the printer is reset by pressing the SHIFT+MENU buttons on
   the printer.

<P><LI>Make sure the Paper Source setting in the printer driver is set to
   Auto Select.

<P><LI>For envelopes, make sure Paper Source setting is correct; for example,
   do not select Envelope Feeder if your printer does not have an optional
   envelope feeder.

<P><LI>Whenever you want to print from the MP tray, make sure the MP tray is
   configured to match the paper size you want to print.

<P><LI>Note the error message on the printer. This usually indicates the paper
   size Word is requesting for the print job. Configure the MP tray for
   this paper size.

<P><LI>Make sure you have a current version of your printer driver.
