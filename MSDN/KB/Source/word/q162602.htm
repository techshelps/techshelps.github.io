</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. What is the best method to use to share documents between Word 97 and
      Word 6.0 or 7.0?

   A. The best method is to use the Word 97 import converter for Word 6.0
      and 7.0. When you use the Word 97 import converter, Word 6.0 and Word
      95 can read Word 97 documents directly. There are several advantages
      to this method:

       - The file size does not increase. That is, the file will be no
         larger than when you saved it from Word 6.0, Word 7.0, or Word 97.

       - You will not have to remember to use the Save As command to save
         the file in a different format. You just save the document as a
         Word Document. With the converter, you can use Word 97 to open
         Word 6.0 and Word 7.0 documents easily, and you can use Word 6.0
         or Word 7.0 to open the Word 97 documents easily. Because you
         won't have to save the document in a different format, you will
         also avoid the prompts that ask you if you want to overwrite the
         existing format with a new format.

       - Using the Word 97 import converter is the best way to preserve
         formatting from Word 97 documents. This will give you the best
         results when you move documents from Word 97 to an earlier version
         of Word.

2. Q. Where can I get the Word 97 import converter?

   A. The converter is available in the "wrd97cnv.exe" file. This file, a
      self-extracting executable file, automatically installs the converter
      on your computer.

      For additional information about how to obtain the Word 97 converter,
      please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q162214.htm">Q162214</A></B>
      TITLE  : How to Obtain the Word 97 Converter


3. Q. How does the Word 97 import converter work?

   A. You can work on a document in Word 97 and save it as a "Word
      Document" (Word 97 native format). You can then take this document to
      another computer running an earlier version of Word with the Word 97
      import converter installed. You can open the Word 97 document in the
      earlier version of Word directly. You can work on it, and when you
      save the document, save it as a "Word Document" (Word 6.0 or Word 7.0
      native format). Because Word 97 can read Word 6.0 and Word 7.0 files
      without a converter, you can then take the document back to the
      computer running Word 97, open the document, work on it, and once
      again save the document as a "Word Document" (Word 97 native format).
      On both computers, you will be saving in native Word Document format,
      without having to change the file type.

4. Q. When I double-click Wrd97cnv.exe, a Setup program is run. What files
      does this Setup program install?

   A. Depending on the version of Word you're using, Word installs either
      the Mswrd832.cnv file (32-bit version of the converter for people
      running Word 7.0) or the Msword8.cnv file (the 16-bit version of the
      converter for people running Word 6.0). This Setup program also
      installs a Readme file called "Wrd97cnv.doc " and it updates the
      necessary registry settings. For more information, see the Readme
      (Wrd97cnv.doc) file installed with the Word 97 converter.

5. Q. In Word 97 I can use the Save As command and save a file in the Word
      6.0/95 format. When is this a good method to use?

   A. This is a good method to use if you do not have the Word 97 import
      converter installed on the computers running the earlier versions of
      Word. Some disadvantages to this method are that

       - The document generated when you save a Word 97 document using the
         Save As Word 6.0/95 option can have a significantly larger file
         size than the original Word 97 document.

       - The Word 6.0/95 export converter generates a Rich Text Format
         document with a .doc file extension. This file extension may cause
         confusion when you exchange files because Word will prompt you
         with questions about overwriting one file format with another.

6. Q. Why is the Word 6.0/95 file larger than the original file?

   A. When you save a document from Microsoft Word 97 for Windows to Word
      6.0/95 format, you generate a Rich Text Format (RTF) file. RTF is a
      text representation of a binary file. It is the format that most
      converters are based on. Because of its nature, RTF inherently
      generates a larger file than the original binary file when the
      document includes a great deal of formatting, pictures, or other
      objects.

      Relatively small documents containing little formatting and few
      objects may actually be smaller in Rich Text Format than in the
      native Word Document format.

      An updated version of the Word 6.0/95 export converter is now
      available. This converter will allow you to save from Microsoft Word
      97 into a true Word 6.0 or 7.0 binary format.

      For more information on the updated export converter, including how
      to obtain it, please see the following article in the Microsoft
      Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q143480.htm">Q143480</A></B>
      TITLE: WD97: Updated Word 6.0/95 Export Converter Available

7. Q. What is RTF (Rich Text Format)?

   A. The Rich Text Format (RTF) standard is a method of encoding formatted
      text and graphics for easy transfer between MS-DOS, Windows, Windows
      95, OS/2, and Apple Macintosh applications.

      The RTF standard provides a format for text and graphics interchange
      that can be used with different output devices, operating
      environments, and operating systems. RTF uses the ANSI, PC-8,
      Macintosh, or IBM PC character set to control the representation and
      formatting of a document, both on the screen and in print. With the
      RTF standard, you can transfer documents created under different
      operating systems and with different software.

8. Q. What happens when I save a document as Word 6.0/95 from Word 97 and
      what types of problems will I see?

   A. If you are working on a document in Word 97 and then decide to save
      the file in Word 6.0/95 format, you save the file as a modified RTF
      document with a .doc extension. If you then open this document in
      Word 6.0 or Word 7.0, you may notice the following behaviors:

       - If the "Confirm Conversions" option is enabled, a dialog box will
         appear asking you to convert from Rich Text Format rather than the
         Word Document format you may expect. This occurs because Word can
         detect that the document is actually an RTF file even though it
         has a .doc extension.

       - If the "Confirm Conversions" option is not enabled, you may notice
         a message on the status bar stating that Word is converting the
         document. Because the document is an RTF file, a conversion is
         needed to convert it to the Word 6.0 or Word 7.0 format even
         though the file has a .doc extension.

       - If you click the Save As option on the File menu, you may notice
         that Word is proposing a file type of Rich Text Format (.rtf) and
         is suggesting a new file name with an .rtf extension. You have a
         few options at this point:

         Option 1: Change the "Save file as type" option to "Word Document
         (.doc)."

         This change will save the new version of your document over your
         previous version and change the file format to Word 6.0 or Word
         7.0 format. Because Word 97 has a built in converter that allows
         it to read Word 6.0 and Word 7.0 files , this is the best solution
         in most situations.

         Option 2: Choose OK.

         The updated version of your document will be saved with the new
         file name with an .rtf extension. You can save your work to this
         file and continue to use this file with the .rtf extension.

         NOTE: By default, Word only lists files with a .doc extension in
         the Open dialog box. You must change the "List files of type"
         option to "Rich Text Format (.rtf)" to see .rtf documents.

9. Q. Why can't I just save my file in Rich Text Format?

   A. There are several advantages to saving in Word 6.0/95 format over
      saving in Rich Text Format:

      - The Word 6.0/95 export converter preserves more formatting than the
        standard RTF export converter. To preserve the most formatting
        possible, use the Word 97 import converter with Word 6.0 or Word
        7.0.

      - The Word 6.0/95 RTF file that is generated is actually smaller than
        the  RTF file that is generated by the standard Rich Text Format
        export converter.

10. Q. Where can I find more information about the Word 6.0/95 Save option
       and the Word 97 converter?

    A. Additional information about file converters is available from the
       following sources:

       - The Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit (ORK). The ORK is available
         on the Microsoft Web site at:

            <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/">http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/</A></B>

       - The WDREAD8.TXT readme file. This file is installed in the
         \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder when you run the
         Office 97 Setup program.

11. Q. Where can I find more information about formatting that is
       retained through the conversion process?

   A. Click the Office Assistant, type "Save as Word 7.0" click Search, and
      then click to view "Results of saving Word 97 documents in other
      formats."

      NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button
