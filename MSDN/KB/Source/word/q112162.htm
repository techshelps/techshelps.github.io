The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0, 6.0a
</UL> 
<P>
WARNING: ANY USE BY YOU OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IS AT
YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this SETUP.STF modification information

<P>
When performing a Workstation installation of Word for Windows, the number
of billboards that are loaded may slow down the installation process.
Billboards are the images displayed on the screen while Word is being
installed. To make Word load only the first billboard and keep it on the
screen for the entire installation, thereby speeding up Setup, do the
following:
<P>
NOTE: The following modifications to SETUP.STF should be performed on the
server installation.

<OL><P><LI>Make a backup of the SETUP.STF file, by copying SETUP.STF to
   SETUPSTF.BAK.

<P><LI>Make a working copy of SETUP.STF, by copying SETUP.STF to SETUPSTF.TMP.

<P><LI>Load SETUPSTF.TMP from your Server installation of Word into Microsoft
   Excel (or any other application you want to edit the file in).

<P><LI>Cursor down to the ======BILLBOARDS====== section.

<P><LI>On the Group line, which is two lines under the BILLBOARDS line, delete
   all numbers to the right of the first number, leaving all leading and
   trailing tabs and spaces.

<P><LI>Save SETUPSTF.TMP.

<P><LI>To ensure that only the correct lines have been edited, exit to an
   MS-DOS prompt and change directories to where your SETUP.STF and
   SETUPSTF.TMP files are located. Then type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      fc.exe /t setupstf.tmp setupstf.bak
</PRE>
<P><LI>If the comparison is successful, the result should be six lines
   displayed, which corresponds to the line changed and the lines before
   and after the change.

<P><LI>If the above comparison is successful, rename SETUPSTF.TMP to SETUP.STF,
   overwriting the previous version. If the comparison fails, make another
   working copy of SETUP.STF and repeat the above steps, using a different
   editor.
<P>
</OL>When the next Setup is run from this installation, the first billboard will
appear and remain until the conclusion of the installation.
