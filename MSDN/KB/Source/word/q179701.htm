</PRE><h2>INSTALLING MICROSOFT WORD 98</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Minimum System Requirements for Microsoft Word 98 and Microsoft Office 98</h3>
 
<P>
To use Word 98 or Office 98, you need:

<UL><LI>Any PowerPC processor-based, Mac OS-compatible system.
<LI>Apple System 7.5 or later.
<LI>16 MB of RAM required to run Word individually (with virtual memory
   turned on); more memory is required to run additional programs
   simultaneously.
<LI>25 MB of RAM required to run Word individually from a network (with
   virtual memory turned on); more memory is required to run additional
   programs simultaneously.
<LI>33-78 MB of available hard disk space to install the Word standalone
   program; approximately 55 MB required for Easy Install, depending on
   the configuration.
<LI>48-148 MB of available hard disk space to install Microsoft Office;
   approximately 90 MB required for Easy Install, depending on the
   configuration.
<LI>CD-ROM drive required (or connection to a Local Area Network if
   installing over network).
<LI>Monitor or display supporting 16 grays or 256 colors and 640x400 or
   greater resolution.
<P>
</UL>To use Word 98 or Office 98, it is *recommended* that you have:

<UL><LI>A PowerPC processor with a clock speed of at least 120 MHz.
<LI>Apple System 7.5.5 or later.
<LI>32 MB of RAM (with virtual memory turned on).
<LI>Color monitor or display supporting greater than 256 colors and
   640x480 resolution.
<P>
</UL><h3>Performance with System 7.5.2 and 7.5.3</h3>
 
<P>
Updates are available for versions 7.5.2 and 7.5.3 of the system software
that contain substantial performance enhancements and improvements. These
updates are strongly recommended by Apple for all Macintosh computers
running previous releases of System 7.5 because they contain bug fixes and
allow Power Macintosh programs to launch significantly faster when virtual
memory is on. The updates to System 7.5.3 and System 7.5.5 are available in
the Value Pack folder on your Microsoft Office 98 CD. For more information
about installing components from the Value Pack, see the About the Value
Pack file in the Value Pack folder on the CD-ROM or on the network you
installed Word from.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Punctuation Characters in Folder Names May Cause Problems</h3>
 
<P>
If the name of the folder you install Microsoft Office 98, Microsoft Excel
98, Microsoft PowerPoint 98, or Microsoft Word 98 into includes a comma
(,), single quotation mark ('), or exclamation point (!), you may have
problems when you use the programs. To avoid problems, use the default
folder or use only letters and numbers in folder names.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Word Installer Overwrites 128-bit Version of Internet Explorer</h3>
 
<P><h3>File MS Internet Library (PPC)</h3>
 
<P>
If you have the 128-bit version of Microsoft Internet Explorer installed on
your Macintosh when you install Microsoft Office 98 or Microsoft Word 98,
the file MS Internet Library (PPC) is replaced by a 40-bit version of the
file with the same file name.
<P>
To see if there is a new 128-bit version of Internet Explorer that is
compatible with Microsoft Office 98, to replace the 40-bit version of the
file MS Internet Library (PPC), you can visit the Internet Explorer
Download Web site at
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/download/128bit.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/download/128bit.htm</A></B>

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Word Installer Doesn't Upgrade Previous Versions Other Than</h3>
 
<P><h3>English</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a previous version of Word other than English installed(such as
Norwegian) when you install Microsoft Office 98 or Microsoft Word 98, Word
98 does not use the previous Normal template, custom dictionaries, address
entries, or glossary entries.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MICROSOFT WORD 98 HELP</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Keyboard to Select Options in the Office Assistant Welcome</h3>
 
<P><h3>Balloon</h3>
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Word for the first time, the Office Assistant
shows a Welcome balloon with three options. You cannot start using Word
until you select the third option, or press ESC to close the balloon. To
select an option by using the keyboard, press COMMAND+1 to select the first
option, COMMAND+2 to select the second option, or COMMAND+3 to select the
third option.
<P>
NOTE: You may not be able to use the keyboard to select these options on a
non-U.S. keyboard, such as Italian, if the numeric keys are available only
when you hold down the SHIFT key.
<P>
<P><h3>Help Topics Graphics Don't Appear</h3>
 
<P>
Help topics that contain graphics may display the message "Unable to
display picture." if there is not enough memory available to display the
graphic. To display graphics in the Help file, increase the memory
requirements for Word by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the desktop, double-click the hard disk icon.
 2. Double-click the folder you installed Office 98 in, usually
    Microsoft Office 98.
 3. Click the Microsoft Word icon.
 4. On the File menu, click Get Info.
 5. Under Memory Requirements, increase the value shown in the Preferred
    Size box by 725K.
<P>
</OL><h3>Help Topics Graphics Don't Print Clearly</h3>
 
<P>
When you print a Help topic that contains a graphic, the graphic
may not print clearly. In particular, this occurs when you print
a topic with grayscale colors by using a printer driver that does
not have options to control dithering.
<P>
<P><h3>Correction to MS Word Help Topics</h3>
 
<P>
The "Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) graphics filter" topic in the MS Word
Help file incorrectly states that the filter supports Encapsulated
PostScript images with Windows Metafile (WMF) embedded previews. Although
the image prints correctly, the embedded Windows Metafile (WMF) preview
does not appear on the screen when you insert the graphic.
<P>
<P><h3>Correction to MS Word Upgrade Help Topics</h3>
 
<P>
The "What's installed with Word 98" topic in the MS Word Upgrade Help file
contains a table with the components installed during an Easy installation
and others available when you use the Custom Installer. The following table
contains corrections to the table in the "What's installed with Word 98"
topic:
<P>
<PRE>                    Installed
                    with                Office Installer and
   Word Component   Easy?               Word Installer option
   ----------------------------------------------------------

   Reports          Yes                 :Microsoft
                                        Word:Wizards and
                                        Templates
   Address Book     Yes                 :Microsoft Word

   Text Converters:
   (all)            Yes                 :Converters and
                                        Filters:Text Converters
   Office Tools:
   Popular Clipart  Yes                 :Office Tools

   Graphics Filters:
   (all)            Yes                 :Converters and
                                        Filters:Graphic Filters

</PRE></OL><h3>Correction to MS Clip Gallery Help Topics</h3>
 
<P>
The "Clip Gallery databases" topic in the MS Clip Gallery Help file
incorrectly states that the Clip Gallery database -- called the primary
database -- is stored in Macintosh HD:Microsoft Office 98:Office:Art
Gallery. The Clip Gallery database is actually stored in Macintosh
HD:System Folder:Preferences:Clip Gallery User Database.
<P>
The "Create a shared Clip Gallery database and configure a user's computer
to access it" topic in the MS Clip Gallery Help file gives the incorrect
name and location for the Clip Gallery database file. The corrected steps
in this topic should read as follows:
<P>
Create a shared Clip Gallery database

<OL><P><LI>To use the existing Clip Gallery database file, Clip Gallery User
   Database, as a shared database, go directly to step 8.
   To create a shared Clip Gallery database from scratch, from the
   desktop, open the Macintosh HD:System Folder:Preferences folder.
</OL>2. Click the Clip Gallery User Database icon, and then type a new name
<PRE>   for this file, such as Clip Gallery User Database Old, to keep as a
   backup.
</PRE></OL>3. Open the Clip Gallery from within any program.
<PRE>   The Clip Gallery creates a new empty Clip Gallery database file
   named Clip Gallery User Database.

</PRE>Step 7 should read as follows:

<OL><P><LI>From the desktop, copy the new Clip Gallery User Database file to a
   central location on the shared disk.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h2>WORKING WITH DOCUMENTS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Increase Performance of Check Grammar as You Type Option</h3>
 
<P>
If the Check Grammar As You Type check box is selected on the Spelling &amp;
Grammar tab in the Preferences dialog box (Tools menu), you can increase
the performance of this feature by doing the following to increase the
memory requirements for Word by 1M:

<OL><P><LI>From the desktop, double-click the hard disk icon.
</OL>2. Double-click the folder you installed Office 98 in, usually
<PRE>   Microsoft Office 98.
</PRE></OL>3. Click the Microsoft Word icon.
4. On the File menu, click Get Info.
5. Under Memory Requirements, enter the value "10000" (without the
<PRE>   quotation marks) in the Preferred Size box.

</PRE><h3>Cannot Undo Edit After Attaching a Template</h3>
 
<P>
When you attach a different template to the active document, the
Undo command (Edit menu) is not available. This may occur after
running a wizard that attaches a template to the active document.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Graph 5.0 Custom Chart Types Don't Appear in Graph 98</h3>
 
<P>
If you created custom chart types in Microsoft Graph 5.0, the custom chart
types are not automatically available in Graph 98. To view the custom chart
types you created in Graph 5.0 in Graph 98, do the following before you
create custom chart types in Graph 98:

<OL><P><LI>From the desktop, double-click the hard disk icon.
</OL>2. Double-click the System Folder icon.
3. Double-click the Preferences icon.
4. Locate the Graph Chart AutoFormats (5) icon and click its name.
5. Type the new name, "Graph Chart User Gallery" (without the quotation
<PRE>   marks), and then press RETURN.

</PRE></OL>The custom chart types you created in Graph 5.0 now appear on the Custom
Types tab in the Chart Type dialog box when you select the User-defined
option in Graph 98.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Graph 97 Object Formatting Appears Incorrectly</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a Word document that contains a Microsoft Graph 97 object
created in Microsoft Windows, some of the chart formatting may appear
incorrectly. To correct the formatting, double-click the chart to open it
in Microsoft Graph 98.
<P>
<P><h3>Document with Far East Fonts Causes Memory Message</h3>
 
<P>
When you open or create a document in Microsoft Word that contains Far East
fonts, you may receive a message indicating that there is not enough memory
to display the requested font. This message appears because of the size of
most Far East fonts. To avoid receiving this message, increase the memory
requirements for Word by 1M by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the desktop, double-click the hard disk icon.
</OL>2. Double-click the folder you installed Office 98 in, usually
<PRE>   Microsoft Office 98.
</PRE></OL>3. Click the Microsoft Word icon.
4. On the File menu, click Get Info.
5. Under Memory Requirements, enter the value "10000" (without the
<PRE>   quotation marks) in the Preferred Size box.

</PRE>NOTE: The amount of memory required to avoid this message will increase if
you use multiple Far East fonts in a document.
<P>
<P><h3>Saving a Document as HTML That Contains Far East Characters</h3>
 
<P>
If you create a document with Far East characters and then save it to HTML
format, you may lose some characters from the file because you aren't able
to access the HTML Document Properties dialog box before you save the file.
To avoid this situation, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Select and copy the text in the document that you want to save as
   an HTML document.
</OL>2. On the File menu, click New.
3. Click the Web Pages tab, and then double-click the Blank Web Page
<PRE>   icon.
</PRE></OL>4. On the Edit menu, click Paste.
5. On the File menu, click Properties.
6. Under HTML Encoding, select the options you want for displaying and
<PRE>   saving your Far East characters, and then click OK.

</PRE><h3>Memory Message When Opening Complex Web Page</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a complex Web page by using the Open Web Page command (File
menu), you may receive a low-memory message. To use the Open Web Page
dialog box to open the Web page, you may need to increase the memory
requirements for Word by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the desktop, double-click the hard disk icon.
</OL>2. Double-click the folder you installed Office 98 in, usually
<PRE>   Microsoft Office 98.
</PRE></OL>3. Click the Microsoft Word icon.
4. On the File menu, click Get Info.
5. Under Memory Requirements, enter the value "10000" (without the
<PRE>   quotation marks) in the Preferred Size box.

</PRE><h3>Drawing Objects in Far East Word Document Are Not Converted</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a document that was created in a Far East version of Word,
drawing objects, such as text boxes, are not converted.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>WORKING WITH MICROSOFT WORD 98</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Printing Envelopes to a Printer That Has an Envelope Feeder</h3>
 
<P>
The ToolsAdvancedSettings macro procedure for setting printer heuristics
(Flags=4/132), that was required in Word 6 to print envelopes when using an
envelope feeder, is not required in Word 98. Instead, you can use a printer
that has an envelope feeder by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Envelopes and Labels.
</OL>2. Click the Envelopes tab.
3. Click Options.
4. Click the Printing Options tab.
5. Select the Use Envelope Feeder check box.
<P>
<P><h3>How Word 98 Upgrades the Word 5.1 Address Book</h3>
 
<P>
If the Word 5.1 address book is installed on your Macintosh, Word 5.1
addresses are added to the new Word 98 address book that is created when
you run Word 98 for the first time. In order for your Word 5.1 addresses to
be added to the Word 98 book correctly, the following must be true of the
addresses in the Word 5.1 book:

<UL><LI>The first line must be the name.
<LI>The second line must be the street address, with no punctuation
   (for example, St instead of St.).
<LI>The third line must be the City, State and ZIP code, with a comma
   between the city and state as the only punctuation.
<P>
</UL>Any parts of a Word 5.1 address that Word 98 does not recognize will, in
most cases, appear in the Notes field of the address. You can then move the
information to the correct fields.
<P>
<P><h3>Shortcut Keys May Not Work with Non-U.S. Keyboard Layouts</h3>
 
<P>
Shortcuts keys may not work in Microsoft Word if you are using a keyboard
layout other than U.S., such as Arabic. To use shortcut keys, change the
keyboard layout to U.S. If you have multiple keyboard layouts selected in
the Keyboard dialog box, including U.S., click U.S. on the Keyboard menu.
If the Keyboard menu does not appear on the menu bar or U.S. is not listed
on the Keyboard menu, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the desktop, point to Control Panels on the Apple menu, and
   then click Keyboard.
</OL>2. In the list of keyboard layouts, select the U.S. check box.
3. Close the Keyboard dialog box.
4. On the Keyboard menu, click U.S.
<P>
For information about using shortcut keys in Word, use the Office Assistant
or the Help Index to search for "shortcut keys." For more information about
changing the keyboard layout, see the documentation that came with your
Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h3>Show the Font Names and List of Styles on the Font Menu and Style Box in a</h3>
 
<P><h3>System Font</h3>
 
<P>
By default, the Font menu and the Style box show the font names and list of
styles in the actual font. To show the font names and list of styles in a
system font instead of the actual font, clear the WYSIWYG Font And Style
Menus check box on the General tab in the Preferences dialog box (Tools
menu).

<P>
<P><h2>MICROSOFT OFFICE 98 VALUE PACK</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Install Value Pack Components if Running Office Programs from the CD</h3>
 
<P><h3>or a Network</h3>
 
<P>
If you run a Microsoft Office program from the CD or network drive instead
of installing it to your hard disk, you cannot use the Value Pack Installer
to install the Value Pack components. The Value Pack Installer requires
that your Office programs be installed on your Macintosh hard disk because,
to work correctly, Value Pack components must be located in specific
folders on your hard disk relative to the rest of the Office files.
<P>
<P><h3>Can Only Run Value Pack:Clip Art:Overview File from CD</h3>
 
<P>
The Overview file located in the Value Pack:Clip Art folder is available to
preview and copy clip art files to the Clipboard but you can only use this
file on the CD. If you copy the Overview file to your hard disk, it will
not function properly. The Overview file searches for the clip art files
when both the Overview file and the clip art files are located on the CD.
