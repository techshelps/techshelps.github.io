The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02, 4.0,
   5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 6.0.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, when you print a document, the
text of the document will sometimes overlap. Below is a list of
possible problems and solutions for text overlapping.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 6.0</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If you are working with a table and have formatted paragraphs with
   negative indents in the cells, the text will move "under" adjacent
   cells. To correct this problem:
<P>
   1. Select the entire table (hold down the OPTION key and
<P><PRE>      double-click anywhere in the table).
</PRE><P>
   2. From the Format menu, choose Paragraph.
<P>
   3. In the Left, Right, and First Indent boxes, enter 0 (zero).
<P>
   4. Press the OK button.

<LI>If you positioned objects with the Frame command (the Position
   command in Word 4.0) you may have placed groups of text on top of
   one another. To keep text from overlapping:
<P>
   1. In the normal view, select the text that is overlapping.
<P>
   2. From the Format menu, choose Frame (Position in Word 4.0).
<P>
   3. Choose the Unframe button (the Reset button in Word 4.0). If
<P><PRE>      this button is unavailable (dimmed), then the overlapping text
      is not caused by groups of text placed on top of one another.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>Word 3.x, 4.0, 5.x</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If your document is formatted with side-by-side paragraphs
   (columns) that have a variety of paragraph indents, do the
   following:
<P>
   Word versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.1
   ---------------------------
<P>
<P><PRE>      1. Add the Side by Side command to the Format menu. From the
<PRE></PRE>         Tools menu (Edit in Word 4.0), choose Commands. From the list
         box, select Side by Side. Under Menu, choose the Add button.
         Then choose the Close button (the Cancel button in Word 4.0).
         Side by Side should appear as a command on the Format menu.

      2. Select the area where the text is overlapping.

      3. Side by Side should appear on the Format menu with a check
         mark. Select Side by Side to clear the check mark. (If the
         Side by Side command does not appear with a check mark, try
         selecting  smaller groups of paragraphs). If you have the
         show Paragraphs mode selected, a small black rectangle will
         appear in the left margin of each paragraph that is
         formatted as side by side.

   Word versions 3.x
   -----------------

      1. Select the area where the text is overlapping.

      2. From the Format menu, choose Paragraph.

      3. Clear the Side by Side check box.

      4. Choose the OK button.

      5. View the document in page preview to see if this solution was
         successful.

</PRE><LI>If a section in your document has been formatted in two or more
   columns and the ruler is adjusted for single-column indents, do one
   of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - From the Format menu, choose Section and make sure that the
      number 1 appears in the Number Of Columns box (this will remove
      the two-column formatting).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - On the ruler, make sure that the right-indent marker is not
      positioned to the right of the vertical dotted line that
      indicates the right margin of the document.
</PRE>
<LI>If the text is justified and the Fractional Widths option is
   selected in the Page Setup dialog box (in Word 3.x the Fractional
   Widths option is in the Print dialog box), clear the Fractional
   Widths check box.
<P>
   Note: Microsoft has been unable to duplicate this particular
   situation in Word 5.0 or later.

<LI>If you are using a print spooler, try disabling the print spooler
   and printing again.
