<P><h2>MESSAGES YOU MAY RECEIVE DURING THE WEB AUTOUPDATE PROCESS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Could Not Update the Web Authoring Tools</h3>
 
<P>
Symptoms:
<P>
You receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not update the Web Authoring Tools. Return to the Office Free
   Stuff web site for troubleshooting tips. Or if you run Word directly
   from a network, ask your system administrator for assistance.

</PRE>After the standard error message, the name of the component that caused
the update to fail is given in square brackets, for example "[STYLES]." For
more detailed information about these components, see the "More
Information" section later in this article.
<P>
Cause:
<P>
This error message may occur when any of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You do not have Microsoft Word 97, or a later version installed. This is
   necessary for updating the Web Authoring Tools.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Word 97 has been set up to run from CD-ROM. Web AutoUpdate requires
   that Word is run from the hard disk, because the update replaces
   some existing files.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The optional Web Page Authoring features were not installed when you
   installed Word, or certain Web Page Authoring components or directories
   have been removed.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The HTML Converter is not installed.
<P>
<P>
</UL>Workaround:
<P>
To install the Web Page Authoring (HTML) features, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run Word Setup and choose to Add/Remove components.

<P><LI>In the Maintenance dialog box, click to select the Web Page
   Authoring (HTML) check box in the Options list.

<P><LI>Click Continue.
<P>
</OL>To install the HTML converter, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run Word Setup and choose to Add/Remove components.

<P><LI>In the Maintenance dialog box, click to select Converters and Filters
   in the Options list, and then click Change Option.

<P><LI>In the Option list, click to select Text Converters, and then click
   Change Option.

<P><LI>In the Options list, click to select HTML Converter.

<P><LI>Click OK twice, and then click Continue.
<P>
</OL>More Information:
<P>
If you are familiar with working with registry settings, you may want to
verify that the settings appear as they are listed in the following table.
This table includes the components that Word looks for in the registry. The
components are checked in the following order. Word must be able to create
and write to the listed directories.
<P>
NOTE: The paths for the default directories may vary depending on where you
set up Microsoft Office.

   [AU_SETUP]   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Html\AU_Setup
   [AUREMOVE]   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Html\AURemove

</PRE>Because the [STYLES] key is checked first, the installation program
typically gives this error message when failing. This problem may occur if
Microsoft Office 97 is not correctly installed, if the "Web Page Authoring"
component is missing, or if you have a read-only installation.
<P>
Under some circumstances, Setup will successfully extract the files from
the package, and then stop without giving any error message. This normally
indicates an unusual partial installation, or a problem determining the
shared tools directory.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
Some Useful Tips:
<P>
You must restart after Setup. Delaying the restart is not harmful, but the
new features won't be available until you restart. The "What's New"
document reiterates this.
<P>
You can tell whether the new tools were installed with a few easy tests:

<UL><LI>When editing an HTML document, if the File menu includes "Publish to
   Web" above "Web Page Preview," the new Html.dot file is installed.

<LI>Insert a table and choose Table Properties on the Table menu. If
   there is a check box labeled "Center table horizontally" under the
   three picture buttons, the new WLL is installed.

<LI>Create a Word document and type "Hello," press ENTER twice, and then
   type "world." Save the document in HTML format. If the empty paragraph
   is removed when the document is saved as HTML (it will look the same
   because of HTML built-in space before and after each paragraph), the new
   converter is installed.
<P>
</UL><h3>AutoUpdate Could Not Download a Newer Version</h3>
 
<P>
Symptoms:
<P>
You receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   AutoUpdate could not download a newer version. Word could not
   connect to the Internet, or the Internet connection returned an
   error. To retry the update, click AutoUpdate on the Tools menu.

</PRE>Cause:
<P>
This error message may occur when any of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>Word cannot connect to an existing Internet connection.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The Internet connection returns an error.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Word could not find Web Page Authoring Tools on the Microsoft
   Internet server.
<P>
</UL><h3>You Already Have the Latest Version of the Web Page Authoring Tools</h3>
 
<P>
Symptoms:
<P>
You receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   You Already Have the Latest Version of the Web Page Authoring Tools

</PRE>Cause:
<P>
You may receive this message if you already have the latest version of the
Web Page Authoring Tools installed on your computer. A later version of the
tools is not currently available.
<P>
Workaround:
<P>
You may want to try the update again in a month.
<P>
<P><h3>AutoUpdate Could Not Check for a Later Version</h3>
 
<P>
Symptoms:
<P>
You receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   AutoUpdate could not check for a newer version

</PRE>followed by an explanation, and the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Choose AutoUpdate from the Tools menu to attempt the download again.

</PRE>Cause:
<P>
This error message may occur when any of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The Internet connection timed out.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The Internet connection could not be established.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The Internet connection returned an error.
<P>
</UL>Workaround:

<P>
<P><h3>Word Can Automatically Check the Internet...</h3>
 
<P>
Symptoms:
<P>
You receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Word can automatically check the Internet for new versions of the
   Word Internet Tools. Dial up and check for a newer version now?

</PRE>Cause:
<P>
Web Page Authoring Tools has a registry key called AutoUpdate. If the
current date is greater than or equal to the date in the AutoUpdate
key, you are prompted to have Word check the Microsoft World Wide Web site
for a later version of the Authoring Tools. Click Yes to allow Word to
check for an update.
<P>
<P><h3>Would You Like to Access the Internet...</h3>
 
<P>
Symptoms:
<P>
You receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Would you like to access the Internet to check for a new version
   of Web page authoring tools?

</PRE>If you want to perform the update check, click Yes.
<P>
Cause:
<P>
This message is displayed after you click AutoUpdate on the
Tools menu.
<P>
Workaround:
<P>
If you click to select the "Don't ask me again" check box, Word will not
present this dialog box again.
<P>
<P><h3>A New Version of the Web Page Authoring Tools Is Available</h3>
 
<P>
Symptoms:
<P>
You receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   A new version of the Web page authoring tools is available.
   Do you wish to update Word now?

</PRE>Cause:
<P>
When you perform the AutoUpdate, if there is a later version of the Web
Page Authoring Tools available, Word prompts you with this message.
<P>
Click Yes to continue the upgrade. If you click No, or click the "Don't Ask
Me Again and Disable Word AutoUpdate" check box, Word will no longer
automatically check for new versions. However, if you do a manual check for
an update, Word begins to check for updates again automatically.
<P>
