<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to use one of the proofing tools within Microsoft Word, such
as Spelling, Grammar, Thesaurus, or Hyphenation, the choices are not listed
on the menus. If either Spelling or Grammar is not available on the menus,
then the preferences for these files (click Preferences on the Tools menu)
will be unavailable (dimmed).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The proofing tools are either not installed or their files have been moved
from the following default location:
<P>
<PRE>   MACINTOSH HD:Microsoft Office 98:Shared Applications:Proofing Tools

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Determine if the following proofing tool files were loaded during Microsoft
Word Setup:
<P>
<PRE>   MS Spelling 2
   MS Grammar
   MS Thesaurus
   Hyphenation

</PRE>To determine if the files were installed, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Word.

<P><LI>In the Finder, on the File menu, click Find.

<P><LI>Set Find Items to your Macintosh HD.

<P><LI>In the box beside Name Contains, type one of the above items, such
   as MS Spelling 2, and then click Find.

<P><LI>On the results screen, under Name, look for the file with the name MS
   Spelling 2, select it, and identify its location.
<P>
   If the file is not already in the " MACINTOSH HD:Microsoft Office
   98:Shared Applications:Proofing Tools" folder, move it so that it is.
<P>
   NOTE: This is the default folder for the installation of the
   Proofing Tools. If you installed them to another folder, move the file
   to the folder you specified when you ran the Setup program.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each proofing tool.
<P>
</OL>If you cannot find the files, or if following these steps does not correct
the problem, then reinstall Word.
<P>
Once the items appear on the menu, check their preferences to make sure
they are turned on. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Preferences, and then click the Spelling And
   Grammar tab.

<P><LI>Under Spelling, click to select the "Check spelling as you type" check
   box.

<P><LI>Under Grammar, click to select the "Check grammar as you type" check
   box.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
