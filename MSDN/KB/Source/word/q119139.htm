The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert a Word object into a document created in another program
(an Excel spreadsheet for example), or when you insert an object created in
another program into a Word document, you may not be able to activate the
object for in-place editing.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: Word Object Inserted into a Document Created in Another Program</h3>
 
<P>
When you double-click a Word for the Macintosh document object that is
embedded in an program that supports OLE, Word starts and the document
opens in a separate window instead of activating in place as expected. You
cannot edit the Word document object in place, even if you select the
document object, click Object on the Edit menu, and then click Edit on the
submenu that appears.
<P>
In other words, you can use only the OLE Open verb to edit a Word document
object; you cannot use the OLE Edit verb to activate the document for
editing in the container application.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2: Object from Another Program Inserted into a Word Document</h3>
 
<P>
In Word 6.0, if your document contains an object you embedded from an OLE
1.0 application, such as Microsoft Excel 4.0, you cannot activate the
object in Word. If you select the object, click Object on the Edit menu,
and then click Edit from the submenu that appears, the application where
you created the file is started and the object is opened in a separate
window--as if you had clicked Open on the submenu instead of Edit.
<P>
By contrast, if your Word 6.0 document contains an OLE 2.0 embedded object,
you can edit the object in place, as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By design, Word for the Macintosh does not implement the OLE Edit verb for
Word document objects. This means you cannot edit a Word document object in
place, as described in case 1, even when the container application supports
OLE.
<P>
In case 2, you cannot edit an OLE 1.0 object in place simply because the
server program does not support OLE 2.0 in-place editing functionality
(in-place editing was introduced for the first time in OLE 2.0).
<P>
In contrast, the Edit verb in Word 6.0 for Windows is fully functional for
in-place editing of Word document objects (provided, of course, that the
container application supports OLE 2.0).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Word for Windows, when you edit an embedded Word document object in
place, some of the Word menus and toolbars temporarily replace those of the
container (active) program. You can then edit the object without leaving
the container program. This functionality does not exist with Word for the
Macintosh document objects.
