The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If there are many fields in your data document, or if the fields have
very long names, you may be unable to see the list of field names when
you click the Insert Merge Field button in the main document. Instead,
a long line will appear along the left side of the screen, or only the
last few field names will appear.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Word is actually displaying the list of merge field names, but the
list is moved off the left edge of the screen. The long vertical line
that appears is actually the right edge of the box of names. This
problem is less noticeable on video cards with higher resolutions.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
Move the Insert Merge Field button to the right side of the Mail Merge
toolbar.
<P>
-or-
<P>
Create the following macro that opens the Insert Field dialog box and add
the macro to the Mail Merge toolbar:
<P>
<PRE>Word 6.x, 7.x:      Sub MAIN
                      Dim DLG As InsertMergeField
                      GetCurValues DLG
                      If Dialog(DLG) Then InsertMergeField DLG
                    End Sub

Word 97:            Sub InsertMergeField()
 Application.Dialogs(wdDialogInsertMergeField).Show
                    End Sub

</PRE><h3>Form Letters</h3>
 
<P>
With the insertion point where you want your first field, press
ALT+SHIFT+F. This brings up another Insert Merge Field dialog box.
Select the field you want and choose OK.
<P>
<P><h3>Envelopes</h3>
 
<P>
Use a smaller data document, one that contains only those fields you
will actually merge.
<P>
-or-

<OL><P><LI>In the Envelope Options box, select the options that correspond to
   your envelope. Choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Envelope Address box, leave the Sample Envelope Address
   blank. Choose OK.

<P><LI>Close the Mail Merge Helper.

<P><LI>The insertion point is at the beginning of the return address.
   Press CTRL+HOME to move the insertion point to the receiver's
   address location.

<P><LI>With the insertion point where you want your first field, press
   ALT+SHIFT+F. This brings up another Insert Merge Field dialog box.
   Select the field you want and choose OK.

<P><LI>Type any punctuation you need and repeat step 5.
<P>
</OL><h3>Labels</h3>
 
<P>
Use a smaller data document, one that contains only those fields you
will actually merge
<P>
-or-

<OL><P><LI>In the Label Options box, select the size and number of labels you
    will be using. Choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Create Labels box, leave the Sample Label blank. Choose OK.

<P><LI>Close the Mail Merge Helper.

<P><LI>You are now in the main document, which now contains a table.
    Place the insertion point in the first cell of the table.
<P>
    If you do not see the dotted lines that separate the rows and
    columns of the table, choose Gridlines from the Table menu.

<P><LI>Press Alt+Shift+F to bring up a different Insert Merge Field dialog.
    Select the appropriate Mail Merge Field, click OK.

<P><LI>Add any spaces, returns, or punctuation and then press ALT+Shift+F to
    insert the next merge field.
<P>

<P><LI>When you have finished laying out the first label, highlight the
    contents of the first cell.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Copy.

<P><LI>Place the insertion point in the next cell. Click the Insert Word
    Field button and select Next Record. This inserts a field called
    "Next" that signals to Word that it is to print the contents of
    the next record in this cell.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Paste. The contents of the first cell
    have now been pasted in this cell.

<P><LI>Highlight the contents of this second cell.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Copy.

<P><LI>Move the insertion point to the beginning of the next cell, and
    choose Paste.
<P>

    filled each label, you are ready to perform the mail merge.
