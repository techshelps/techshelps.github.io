The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are running Microsoft Word for Windows in Microsoft Windows
operating system version 3.1 and no TrueType fonts are available in
Word for Windows, it is likely that the printer driver you are using
is outdated (that is, the driver is from Microsoft Windows version
3.0).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A Windows version 3.0 printer driver installed in the Microsoft
Windows operating system version 3.1 prevents TrueType fonts from
appearing in Word for Windows. The TrueType fonts may appear in other
applications such as Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Windows Write, even
though the driver is outdated. The exact results vary from driver to
driver. In all cases, you should install the Windows version 3.1 printer
driver.
<P>
If your TrueType fonts are not available in Word for Windows, verify
the version of your printer driver. From the Word for Windows File
menu, choose Print Setup. Choose the Setup button. The printer driver
dialog box should contain an About or Info button. (If there is no
About or Info button, the version of the driver is included somewhere
in the printer driver dialog box.) If you choose the About button, the
copyright date and version number of the printer driver will be
displayed. Windows version 3.1 printer drivers include "for Windows
3.1" or "Universal Printer Driver v 3.1." Windows 3.0 printer drivers
may or may not include "for Windows 3.0."
<P>
If you are uncertain whether or not your printer driver is the correct
version, consult the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" or contact
Microsoft Windows Product Support Services at (425) 637-7098. You can
also contact Microsoft Word for Windows Product Support Services at
(425) 462-9673 (462-WORD).
<P>
If you have an older printer driver installed, choose the Printers
icon in the Windows Control Panel, select the driver, and choose the
Remove button. You may also need to delete the driver file, which is
located in the \SYSTEM subdirectory of your Windows directory. After
you remove the old printer driver, install a Windows version 3.1
printer driver by choosing the Add button from the Printers dialog box
in the Control Panel.
