 --------------------------------------------------------------------

</PRE>This Application Note describes how to add outside bar commands to
Microsoft Word versions 5.0 and 5.1 for the Macintosh. These commands
are necessary only if you are printing a booklet-style document, where
even and odd pages are mirrored, because left border formatting in
Word 5.0 and 5.1 will not alternate to a right border on odd-numbered
pages. (If even and odd pages are not mirrored, you can apply a left
border to paragraphs that require an outside bar by using the Border
command on the Format menu.) Outside bar commands are available in
Word 4.0 but are only available in Word 5.0 and 5.1 when you add
special settings to your Word folder.
<P>
Included with this Application Note is a disk containing the Outside
Bar Settings file.
<P>
<P><h3>To Use the Outside Bar Settings File with Word 5.0 and 5.1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Copy the Outside Bar Settings file from the enclosed MW0537 disk to
   your Microsoft Word folder.

<P><LI>Start Word and choose Commands from the Tools menu.

<P><LI>Under Settings File, choose the Open button.

<P><LI>In the Open dialog box, select the Outside Bar Settings file and
   choose the Open button. Choose the Close button.
<P>
</OL>The Single Bar Paragraph Border command will now appear on the Format
menu. For more information about using more than one settings file
with Word, see pages 727-729 in the "Microsoft Word User's Guide."
<P>
The newly installed Single Bar Paragraph Border command will apply a 1-
point thick outside bar to the selected paragraphs. However, as with
other paragraph borders in Word, there are many outside bar commands
available.
<P>
<P><h3>To Add Other Outside Bar Commands to a Menu</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Word and choose Commands from the Tools menu.

<P><LI>Under Settings File, choose the Open button.

<P><LI>In the Open dialog box, select the Outside Bar Settings file and
   choose the Open button.

<P><LI>From the list of options displayed on the left, select "Paragraph
   Border:". Make sure you select the option with the colon (:)
   following it.

<P><LI>From the Command list, select one of the following outside bar
   commands that you want to add to the Format menu. (A diamond next
   to the command indicates the command is currently being displayed
   on a menu.)
<P>
<P><PRE>      Double Bar Paragraph Border
      Dotted Bar Paragraph Border
      Hairline Bar Paragraph Border
      Single Bar Paragraph Border
      Thick Bar Paragraph Border
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Menu box, choose the Add button. (If the command already
   appears on the menu, the Add button will be unavailable.)

<P><LI>Repeat steps 4 through 6 for all the outside bar commands that
   should be added to the Format menu. Choose the Close button.
<P>
</OL>For more information about adding commands to menus, see Chapter 40 of
the "Microsoft Word User's Guide."
<P>
<P><h3>To Use Outside Bar Formatting in a Document</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select the paragraphs that require outside bar formatting.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose the desired outside bar command.
<P>
   NOTE: When the Mirror Even/Odd option is selected, an outside bar
   is displayed as a left border when Normal or Page Layout is chosen
   from the View menu; however, in print preview and on the printed
   document, the outside bar will appear to the left of paragraphs on
   even-numbered pages and to the right of paragraphs on odd-numbered
   pages.
<P>
</OL>When the outside bar command is used in a document, the following
guidelines apply:

<OL><P><LI>The Mirror Even/Odd option must be selected in the Format Document
   dialog box. Otherwise, outside bars will appear as left paragraph
   borders.

<P><LI>If a paragraph has outside bar formatting and you choose Borders
   from the Format menu and then choose the OK button (even though you
   make no change to the border within the dialog box), the outside
   bar formatting will change to a left paragraph border. To reapply
   the outside bar formatting, follow steps 1 and 2 of the above
   section, "To use outside bar formatting in a document."
<P>
</OL>For more information about using the outside bar commands with Word
5.0 and 5.1, call Microsoft Product Support Services at
(206) 635-7200.
