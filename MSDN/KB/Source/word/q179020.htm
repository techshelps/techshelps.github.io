<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article includes detailed instructions about how to create a new
toolbar, how to add or remove items from that toolbar, and how to change
the position of the toolbar.
<P>
Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition includes functionality that allows you
to modify existing toolbars and to create or delete custom toolbars.
<P>
TIP: The standard toolbars in Word contain the majority of the functions
performed by users. Rather than modify these toolbars, you should
supplement them with additional, custom toolbars that suit your particular
work style. Note that you can create templates to hide the original
toolbars and display custom toolbars. For more information about templates,
see the "References" section of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Toolbar</h3>
 
<P>
To create a toolbar, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition by double-clicking the
   Microsoft Word icon in the Microsoft Office 98 folder.

<P><LI>On the View menu, point to Toolbars, and click Customize.

<P><LI>Click the Toolbars tab.

<P><LI>Click New, and type a name for the new toolbar.
<P>
   TIP: Use a name that will indicate the primary function of the toolbar
   or the user creating it.

<P><LI>From the Make Toolbar Available To list, select Normal, and click OK.
<P>
   NOTE: If the toolbar is only to be available when a particular template
   or document is open, the document or template must be open when the
   toolbar is created and it should be selected in this dialog box.
<P>
   The Customize dialog box and the new toolbar should both be visible. You
   may need to move the Customize dialog box if it is covering the new
   toolbar. The new toolbar will be a small, square, "floating" toolbar
   somewhere in the document area of Word. The toolbar is too small to
   display its name at this time. As you add items, the name will be
   displayed in the title bar of the toolbar. Drag the new toolbar and the
   Customize dialog box so you can see both at the same time.
<P>
</OL><h3>Adding Commands to the Toolbar</h3>
 
<P>
To add commands to the toolbar, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, point to Toolbars, and click Customize.

<P><LI>In the Customize dialog box, click the Commands tab.

<P><LI>Under Categories, click File. Then, under Commands, drag New to the new
   toolbar.
<P>
   Repeat this process to drag several commands from various categories to
   the new toolbar.
<P>
</OL><h3>Removing an Item from the Toolbar</h3>
 
<P>
To remove an item from the toolbar, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, point to Toolbars, and click Customize.

<P><LI>Drag the item to be removed from the toolbar to the document area of
   Word.

<P><LI>Close the Customize dialog box when you're finished removing items.
<P>
   NOTE: The Customize dialog box must be open to delete items from a
   toolbar.
<P>
</OL><h3>Positioning or Docking a Toolbar</h3>
 
<P>
When the toolbar is floating, drag the title bar to move it. To size a
floating toolbar, drag its lower-right corner. A toolbar cannot be sized
such that some of the items on it are hidden. However it can be positioned
close to the edge of the screen so that some of the items cannot be seen.
<P>
To dock a toolbar, drag it to the top, side, or bottom if the document
window so that it looks like about half the toolbar has disappeared and the
length of the toolbar is oriented with the edge where it is to be docked.
<P>
NOTE: If you drag the toolbar to the very bottom of the screen (completely
behind items at the bottom) while the Status bar and the Drawing toolbar
are visible there, the toolbar may seem to disappear. If this occurs, hide
both the Drawing toolbar (on the View menu, click Toolbars, and click to
clear the Drawing check box) and the Status bar (on the Tools menu, click
Preferences, click the View tab, and click to clear the Status Bar check
box). This will allow you to see enough of the title bar at the top of the
toolbar to drag it back up.
<P>
When a toolbar is docked, there is a gray bar at the top or left of the
toolbar (depending on where it is docked). Click the bar to drag it from
its docked position. If two or more toolbars are docked in the same
location, portions of each may be invisible. This can be adjusted by
re-docking one or more of the bars using the gray bar.
