The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Change Case command may not change the selection to Sentence case or 
Title Case in the following conditions.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1</h3>
 
<P>
The Change Case command (SHIFT+F3) does not change to Title Case when any 
of the following conditions are true.

<UL><LI>The selection includes an end-of-sentence punctuation (such as a period,
   question mark, or exclamation mark). Word changes from UPPERCASE to
   lowercase to Sentence case only.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The selection begins with a space. Word changes from UPPERCASE to 
   lowercase to Sentence case only.
<P>
</UL><h3>Case 2</h3>
 
<P>
The Change Case command does not change to Sentence case when any of the 
following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The selection does not include the end-of-sentence punctuation. Word
   changes from UPPERCASE to lowercase to Title Case only.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The selection of an incomplete sentence includes the last letter in the
   paragraph but does not include end-of-sentence punctuation. Word changes
   from UPPERCASE to lowercase to Title Case only.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Change Case command does not change a complete sentence to Title Case.
Similarly, the Change Case command assumes that a non-sentence selection is
never formatted for Sentence case. The command determines whether the
selection is a sentence by checking for end-of-sentence punctuation. This
feature is by design of the (SHIFT+F3) for the Change Case command.
<P>
However, when the Change Case command does not change an incomplete 
sentence to Title Case because the selection begins with a space, the 
behavior is not by design.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products 
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in 
Microsoft Word 97 for Windows and Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Change Case command changes selected characters to all uppercase 
letters, all lowercase letters, or a combination of uppercase and lowercase 
letters. The Change Case command affects character capitalization but not 
character formatting, such as Small Caps or All Caps. For example, if you 
apply title case to text that already has Small Caps format, the first 
letter of each word becomes an uppercase letter while the rest of the 
characters retain the Small Caps format.
<P>
<PRE>   Change Case option     Function
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Sentence case          Capitalizes the first letter of the first word in
                          the selected sentence, or the first word after
                          the end of a sentence.

   lowercase              Changes selected text to all lowercase letters.

   UPPERCASE              Changes selected text to all uppercase letters.

   Title Case             Capitalizes the first letter of each word in the
                          selection.

   tOGGLE cASE            Changes all uppercase letters to lowercase
                          letters and all lowercase letters to uppercase
                          letters in the selection.

</PRE>NOTE: You cannot use SHIFT+F3 to change the case of your selected text to 
tOGGLE cASE. You must click Change Case on the Format menu, click to select 
tOGGLE cASE, and then click OK.
<P>
In Word 6.0 and later, the Change Case command differs from that of earlier 
versions of Word, in which Word switches from uppercase to lowercase to 
title case when you press SHIFT+F3, regardless of the context.
