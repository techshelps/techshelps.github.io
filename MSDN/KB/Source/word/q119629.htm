<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a custom template is copied from a workstation to a shared directory
on a server, the macros and buttons created for that custom template are
not available to other network users.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The custom template was first created as a document based on the Normal
template located on a workstation and later saved as a template. As a
result, all macros and buttons that were created in this template are
stored globally in the Normal template on the originating workstation.
<P>
When the template is moved to a shared directory, the macros and buttons
are not retained as part of the new template. When another user on another
workstation creates a document based on this template, the original Normal
template is not available, and hence none of the macros or buttons are
available. This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Method 1: Create the template as a template initially rather than as a
<PRE>          document. To do this, choose New from the File menu, select the
          Normal template, choose the Template option, and then choose the
          OK button. All macros and toolbar buttons will be stored in your
          new template and will move with the template when you copy it to
          the server.

</PRE>Method 2: If a user has already created a custom template and that template
<PRE>          was based on his or her Normal template, rename the NORMAL.DOT on
          each workstation, then copy the Normal template from the
          workstation where the template was originally created. If there
          are too many workstations, each user can rename his or her
          NORMAL.DOT and download the correct one across the network.
