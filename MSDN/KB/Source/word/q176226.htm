The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you start your Macintosh from the System CD, you cannot start
Word 98 Macintosh Edition, and you receive one of the following error
messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Word is unable to locate support files which are required to
   run. Please reinstall Microsoft Word.

   -or-

   Word cannot launch the First Run Installer. There may not be enough free
   memory to launch the installer, the installer may have been moved, or
   your startup disk may be write protected. Try the following:

       - Quit any other programs that are running to free memory. If
         Virtual Memory is off, turn it on and restart your computer.

       - Reinstall Word to make sure that all files needed to run Word are
         installed correctly.

       - Reboot from an unlocked startup disk and relaunch Word.

   -or-

   The application "Microsoft Word" cannot be opened because an unexpected
   error occurred.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Word, several OLE files are copied to the System Folder
(the files are copied to the System Folder that is active when you run the
Word Setup program). Word uses these files at startup.
<P>
When you start the Macintosh from the System CD, the active System Folder
is changed. That is, when you start the Macintosh from the CD, the System
Folder it uses is located on the CD. However, the System Folder on the CD
does not contain the files that Word uses at startup; therefore, you
receive an error message.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If Word cannot find the OLE files in the System Folder, it searches for
them in the "Microsoft Office 98:Office" folder on your hard disk.
Therefore, to work around this problem you can copy the following files
from the "System Folder:Extensions" folder on your hard disk to the
"Microsoft Office 98:Office" folder (also on your hard disk):

<UL><LI>Microsoft Component Library
<LI>Microsoft OLE Automation
<LI>Microsoft OLE Library
<LI>Microsoft Structured Storage
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Copying these OLE files from the Extensions folder to the Office
folder will allow you to start Word 98 for testing purposes. However, many
functions such as printing will be unavailable.
<P>
To copy the files, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the Finder, open the System:Extensions folder.

<P><LI>While the Extensions folder is still open, open the Office
   folder that is located inside the Microsoft Office 98 folder.

<P><LI>With both folders open, press and hold down the OPTION key on the
   keyboard. Drag the files from the Extensions folder to the Office
   folder.
<P>
   NOTE: Holding the OPTION key causes the file to be copied instead of
   moved.
<P>
</OL>To start your Macintosh from a compact disc in the CD-ROM drive, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert a System CD in the CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>Start the computer while holding down the C key on the keyboard.
<P>
</OL>For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

      TITLE     : Booting a PowerMacintosh from the System CD

</PRE></OL>Once you are finished troubleshooting, delete the extra OLE files from
the Office folder so that the files don't take up extra space.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
As with earlier versions of Word, starting from the Macintosh System CD
installation disk allows you to troubleshoot problems where Word will
not start. In general if the problem persists after starting the
computer from the CD, you can usually conclude that something is wrong
with Word rather than with the System or Finder files on the hard disk.
<P>
Alternate testing methods can be used instead of starting from the
System disk. For example, you can try starting the computer with extensions
off or reinstalling the system files to a new System folder.
<P>
To perform an "extensions off" startup on a Macintosh computer running
System 7 or 8, press and hold the SHIFT key on the keyboard while
starting or restarting the computer.
<P>
For information about how to install the system files to a new folder
on a Macintosh using System 7.5, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
