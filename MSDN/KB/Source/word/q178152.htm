The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
All Documents Sent As Mail in Word 98 using the Send To command on the File
menu are sent as attachments using the Word 98 file format.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a document using foreign file format is opened in Microsoft Word 98
Macintosh Edition, it is converted to the Word 98 file format for editing.
When the Send To command on the File menu is used to mail the document, the
current document is inserted into a mail message as an attachment. Because
the document is open, it is a Word 98 document, so what gets attached in
mail is a copy of the Word 98 document that is currently open. At the time
the document is saved a choice can be made as to what format to save the
file in. However, anytime Word 98 has a document open, the document will be
in memory in the Word 98 native format.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Save the file in the format that you want to send it in. Then, attach the
saved file to a mail message from inside your mail program.
<P>
To Save a File in a foreign file format in Word:

<OL><P><LI>Click Save As on the File menu.

<P><LI>Open the Save File As Type: drop down list and Select the desired format
   from the list.

<P><LI>Click Save
<P>
</OL>To attach the saved document to a mail message, consult the documentation
for your e-mail program.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
