The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Occasionally, a Macintosh System error occurs when you perform an operation
in Word for the Macintosh. Although you may see the message while you are
working in Word, the error is usually caused by the Macintosh system
software. This article provides general steps for determining how to
address a system error generated by Word for the Macintosh.
<P>
An example of a Macintosh System error occurs if you double-click the
Microsoft Word application icon and a System error of Type 1 or Type 3
occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the following steps to troubleshoot System error problems that occur in
Word.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1: Test Extensions</h3>
 
<P>
Extensions and Control Panel files add functionality to your Macintosh
system. Sometimes one of these files conflicts with a program by attempting
to store its information at a location in memory where another program
stores its information.
<P>
If you have System 7.x or Mac OS 8.0, you can temporarily turn off
extensions by pressing and holding down the SHIFT key and then starting
your computer. Continue holding down the SHIFT key until the "Welcome to
Macintosh Extensions Off" (System 7.5.x or earlier) or "Welcome to Mac OS
Extensions Disabled" (System 7.6.x or later) message disappears. To
reactivate extensions, restart your computer by choosing Restart from the
Special menu.
<P>
NOTE: If the System error caused your computer to stop responding (hang),
shut down the machine (turn off the power if necessary), then restart with
extensions off, as described above.
<P>
If the System error does not recur in Word, one of your extensions or
Control Panel files is probably causing the problem. Isolate the problem
file, or contact Apple Technical Support at (800) SOS-APPL for assistance.
<P>
If the System error DOES recur in Word, continue with step 2.
<P>
The third-party contact information included in this article is provided to
help you find the technical support you need. This contact information is
subject to change without notice. Microsoft in no way guarantees the
accuracy of this third-party contact information.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2: Rebuild the Desktop File</h3>
 
<P>
You should rebuild your Desktop file on a regular basis: as frequently as
once per month. Your Desktop consists of a pair of invisible system files
that maintain information about the files and folders on your hard disk.
<P>
To rebuild your Desktop file, hold down the OPTION and Command (Apple) keys
and start your computer. Hold down the OPTION and Command keys until the
"Are you sure you want to rebuild the desktop file ..." message appears.
Then release them and choose OK.
<P>
If the System error no longer occurs in Word after you rebuild your
Desktop, you can conclude that you had a damaged Desktop file.
<P>
If the System error does recur in Word, continue with step 3.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 3: Test the Word Settings File</h3>
 
<P>
Quit Word if it is still running. If you're not sure whether Word is still
running, choose the Finder icon on the right end of the menu bar. If
Microsoft Word appears on the menu, Word is still running. In this case,
choose Microsoft Word from the Finder menu. Then choose Quit from the File
menu.
<P>
Open the Preferences Folder in the System Folder, and drag the Word
Settings (5), Word Settings (6), or Word Settings (8) file from the
Preferences Folder and drop it next to the Trash icon. Be sure you do not
double-click this file, because it starts Word; if this happens, quit Word
again before you continue.
<P>
If the System error no longer occurs in Word after you disable your Word
Settings file, you can conclude that your Word Settings file is damaged. In
this case, drag the Word Settings file to the Trash. When no Word Settings
file exists, Word creates a new one with default settings when you quit
Word.
<P>
If the System error does recur in Word, continue with step 4.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 4: Test the System</h3>
 
<P>
To rule out system corruption as the cause of your System error in Word,
start (boot) your Macintosh using a Disk Tools disk or System CD. These
disks contain programs you can use to initialize, test, and repair disks.
(If you have System 6, use the System Tools or System Startup Disk.)
<P>
If you are using Word 6 for the Power Macintosh, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q128747.htm">Q128747</A></B>
   TITLE     : Power Mac Word Doesn't Start After Booting from Disk Tools

</PRE>To start your Macintosh using the Disk Tools disk, insert that disk in the
internal floppy disk drive and then restart your computer. If your computer
ejects the disk, immediately push it back into the disk drive.
<P>
To start your Macintosh using the System CD, insert the CD into the CD-ROM
drive and then restart your computer and hold down the C key during the
boot process.
<P>
If the System error no longer occurs in Word, you can conclude that the
System software on the hard disk is damaged. In this case, you must
reinstall your Macintosh system software. Be sure to delete the old System
and Finder files before you reinstall the system software using your Apple
System Install disks. For assistance, check your Apple Macintosh manual, or
contact Apple technical support. (NOTE: It's always a good idea to back up
your hard disk before you reinstall the Macintosh system software.)
<P>
If the System error DOES recur in Word, you may have a problem with the
hard drive driver; continue with step 5.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 5: Run the Hard Drive Updater If You Have System 7</h3>
 
<P>
Run the HDSC Setup program, which is located on the Disk Tools disk. When
prompted, choose Update, then restart your computer.
<P>
IMPORTANT: If no options are available in the HDSC Setup program, your hard
disk may be formatted with something other than Apple Macintosh software.
<P>
If the System error no longer occurs in Word, you can conclude that your
hard drive driver was damaged or that your hard disk was originally
formatted with System 6. In the latter case, the HDSC Setup program updated
the hard drive driver for use with System 7.
<P>
If the System error still recurs in Word, reinstall your Word program.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 6: Reset the Parameter RAM (PRAM)</h3>
 
<P>
To reset Parameter RAM, restart or turn on your computer and while pressing
the COMMAND+OPTION+P+R keys. The Macintosh should chime two to five times
before you release the keys. This action resets the Macintosh to its
factory defaults and may help the computer locate the startup disk.
<P>
NOTE: When you reset the PRAM, you may need to reset various control panel
settings, such as 32-bit addressing in the Memory control panel, the type
of network you access, and screen resolution.
