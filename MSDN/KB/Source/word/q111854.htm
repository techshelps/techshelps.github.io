<PRE><B><A HREF="../WORD/Q106137.htm">Q106137</A></B>     GP Fault When Running Macro with "Dim Dlg As" Statement

</PRE>If your WordBasic macro dimensions a built-in Word for Windows dialog
box (using the Dim Dlg As statement) but does not subsequently run the
GetCurValues statement, a general protection (GP) fault error may
occur when you run the macro. This occurs frequently in Word version
6.0 for Windows if you run a macro in Word 6.0 that you created in
Word 2.x.

</PRE>In Word 2.x and 6.0 for Windows, Find File ignores the Match Case box
for all fields except the Containing Text (version 6.0) or the Any
Text (versions 2.x) field. Whether or not Match Case is selected, Word
will find files that match what is typed in the Title, Subject,
Author, Keywords, or Containing Text/Any Text fields, regardless of
the case.
