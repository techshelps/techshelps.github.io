The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you right-click a Word document in the Open dialog box (click Open on
the File menu) and then click Print on the shortcut menu, the Print dialog
box does not appear and you are unable to select which document property to
print.
<P>
-or-
<P>
When you select a Word document in the Open dialog box (click Open on the
File menu) and then click Print from the Commands And Settings button, the
Print dialog box does not appear and you are unable to select which
document property to print.
<P>
NOTE: This functionality is different from that in Word for Windows 95.
When you click Print on the shortcut menu (or click Print from the Commands
And Settings button), the Print dialog box does appear and you can select
which document property you want to print from the Print What box. (For
example, you can select to print Key Assignments.)
<P>
NOTE: The information in the Microsoft Word 97 for Windows Help file was
not changed to reflect the change in functionality and is incorrect.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This functionality is by design. The right-click and print functions were
changed in Word 97 to be consistent with other Windows programs.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To select which document property to print, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open your Word document.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Print.

<P><LI>In the Print dialog box, in the Print What box, select which document
   property you want to print, and then click OK.
<P>
   For example, if you want to print the Key Assignments for your document,
   in the Print What box, select Key Assignments.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you click Print on the File menu, you can select which document
property information of your document you want to print.
<P>
For example, in the Print dialog box, in the Print What box, you can choose
to print Document Properties, Comments, Styles, AutoText entries, or Key
Assignments.
<P>
NOTE: If you select anything other than Document in the Print What box,
the document will not print.
<P>
The information in the Microsoft Word 97 for Windows Help file was not
changed to reflect the change in functionality. To see the incorrect
information about printing document properties, click the Office Assistant,
type "print document information," click Search, click the topic "Print
property information or other document information" and then click to view
"Print property information for several documents at once."
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
