<P>
<PRE>  1. Q. What is Microsoft Internet Assistant for Word for Windows?

     A.  Internet Assistant is a free add-on program that makes Word for
         Windows the easiest, most powerful tool for creating, exploring,
         and sharing information on the World Wide Web (WWW), a global
         network of servers on the Internet.

  2. Q. What is the difference between Internet Assistant version 1.0z and
        version 2.0z?

     A. Version 1.0z (Wordia.exe) is designed for use with Word for Windows
        6.0a or 6.0c, while version 2.0z (Wrdia20z.exe) is designed for use
        with Word version 7.0 for Windows 95 or Word for Windows NT.

  3. Q. Is there a version of Internet Assistant for the Macintosh?

     A. Yes. This is version 2.0 (Macia20z.hqx) which is designed for use
         with Word versions 6.0.1 or 6.0.1a for the Macintosh.

  4. Q. How do I get this add-on?

     A. You can find all versions of Microsoft Internet Assistant on the
   
      The following file is available for download from the Microsoft
      Software Library:
      
       ~ Macia20z.hqx
      
      For more information about downloading files from the Microsoft
      Software Library, please see the following article in the Microsoft
      Knowledge Base:

  5. Q. How does Internet Assistant for Word simplify creating Web pages?

     A. Anyone who knows Word automatically knows how to write documents
        for the Internet because the Internet Assistant for Word now
        automatically generates hypertext markup language (HTML), the
        standard file format of World Wide Web documents. You no longer
        need to learn the HTML format or spend time to manually input HTML
        tags to create documents for the World Wide Web. With Internet
        Assistant, you can create hyperlinks between documents with simple
        Copy and Paste commands.

  6. Q. Does this work directly with my other Microsoft Office
        applications, such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and
        Microsoft Access?

     A. Yes. You can easily create hyperlinks from Word to other Microsoft
        Office applications. This means you can create richly formatted
        compound documents using all the powerful word processing
        capabilities of Word without encountering all the limitations of
        the HTML format. The HTML converter for Internet Assistant 1.0 does
        not save the layout of tables or columns, nor does it save embedded
        objects. You can, however, save these layouts and objects in a Word
        for Windows document and create a hyperlink to the Word document.
        Internet Assistant 2.0 does convert Word tables and embedded
        graphics. For more information, see Help in Internet Assistant.

  7. Q. Can I use Internet Assistant to browse or surf the Internet?

     A. Yes. It's easy to connect to and browse the Internet using Internet
        Assistant because you can do it directly from Word's familiar
        interface, which eliminates the need to use different authoring and
        browsing tools.

        You also have access to the most popular Internet services because
        Internet Assistant comes with built-in support for the key Internet
        protocols (namely, HTTP, FTP, and Gopher).

  8. Q. What are the system requirements for Internet Assistant, version
        1.0z?

     A. Internet Assistant version 1.0z requires the following:
