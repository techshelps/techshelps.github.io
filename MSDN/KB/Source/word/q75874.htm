The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
<P>
In Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, TrueType fonts may redraw,
scroll, and print slower than PostScript fonts. TrueType fonts are
rasterized (resized, interpreted and converted from font outlines to
bitmaps) by the Font Manager, which creates bitmaps of every font from
scratch. PostScript screen fonts are preinstalled for particular sizes
and rasterized by the PostScript printer.
<P>
Because TrueType fonts are rasterized by the Font Manager, rather than
the printer, the fonts provide crisp screen images of any point size.
However, TrueType is slow to redraw the screen, especially on older
Macintosh machines. PostScript bitmapped screen fonts produce screen
images faster, but they are limited to displaying installed font
sizes.
<P>
TrueType screen fonts are stored in a specific cache (memory space)
for quicker bitmap availability. However, TrueType screen fonts and
printer bitmaps compete for the same memory space when you print. The
screen fonts are overwritten by the printer bitmaps. This causes
scrolling to become slow after you print the document and print time
to become slow after you use screen scrolling.
<P>
Because TrueType fonts are rasterized by the system, documents with
TrueType fonts appear to take longer to print because the Macintosh
is in use longer. Because PostScript fonts are interpreted by the
printer, the computer becomes available sooner.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Fonts consist of outlines describing the curves and lines of a letter
form. If an application requests a font's outline, the Font Manager
returns a bitmap for screen display. If there is no bitmap available
in the requested size, a TrueType font passes its outline information
to the Font Manager's rasterizer. The TrueType rasterizer is actually
three separate programs: a scaler, a hint interpreter, and a scan
converter.
<P>
The TrueType rasterizer interprets detailed instructions (hints)
embedded in each TrueType font. Because these three programs and each
font's hints take up a significant amount of memory, some documents
containing multiple TrueType fonts can be extremely slow to print or
may not print at all.
<P>
PostScript fonts contain only simple hints that define the letter form
and depend on intelligence built in to the PostScript interpreter
located in the printer or in Adobe Type Manager (ATM).
<P>
Note: If you use ATM, the screen redraws slowly on older Macintosh
machines (similar to TrueType). ATM rasterizes screen fonts with a
built-in rasterizer and stores them in a memory cache. If you send a
document to a PostScript printer, printer bitmaps are stored in the
printer and screen bitmaps in the system. When ATM prints to a
non-PostScript printer, page and screen bitmaps compete for the same
memory space, causing slower scrolling and printing.
