<UL><LI>Microsoft Direct Mail Manager for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a password protected file with Direct Mail Manager, you may
not receive the results you expect.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1</h3>
 
<P>
When you try to open a password protected address list in Direct Mail
Manager, you may receive either an error message, the address list won't
open, or you get unusual behavior.
<P>
NOTE: This article discusses password protected address lists from Word 97,
Access 97 and Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2</h3>
 
<P>
When you try to open a Word address list that is protected for comments or
forms, you receive an error message and cannot import your address list
into Direct Mail Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>

before you open it in Direct Mail Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Word 97</h3>
 
<P>
Password Protected Address List:
<P>
When you open a password protected Word document in Direct Mail Manager, a
Word session will start and prompt you for the password for the file. To
continue with Direct Mail Manager after entering the password, you must
switch back to Direct Mail Manager by clicking the Direct Mail Manager
button on the Windows taskbar. When you click Next to import your address
list records, the Word session will end and the Direct Mail Manager process
will continue as usual.
<P>
NOTE: If you exit the Word session after typing the password for the
address list, you will quit the Word session and Direct Mail Manager.
<P>
If you type an incorrect password to open the address list, the following
error message will be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Error (5408) - The password is incorrect. Word cannot open the
   document.
   (&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;path&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;)

   This error occurred when attempting to open the address list file
   '&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;path&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;'. Please check that (1) the file exists,
   (2) you have selected a file format supported by Direct Mail Manager,
   and (3) it is not locked or your access is otherwise restricted.

</PRE>To continue, click OK to close the error message and then click Next in
Direct Mail Manager to open the address list. A Word session will start up
and Word will again prompt you for the address list password. Type in the
correct password and click OK.
<P>
