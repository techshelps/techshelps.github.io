The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
<LI>IBM OS/2, version 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Word 6.0 for Windows Tutorial feature is not compatible with the WIN-
OS/2 system under OS/2 version 2.1 when running Word as a windowed
(as opposed to full screen) WIN-OS/2 program.
<P>
The Word Setup program is configured to not install the tutorial feature
when being set up under OS/2.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some of the functions performed in the tutorial component of Word 6.0 for
Windows involve program-controlled cursor movement and special window
drawing effects.
<P>
These functions will operate correctly if the tutorial is being run with
Word while running in a full screen WIN-OS/2 session. To configure Word to
run as a full screen application, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the OS/2 desktop, locate the icon for the Word 6.0 for Windows
   program.

<P><LI>Right-click the Word 6.0 for Windows program icon, point to Open, and
   then click Settings.

<P><LI>Click the Session tab.

<P><LI>Select the WIN-OS/2 Full Screen option.

<P><LI>Close the Settings window.
<P>
</OL>Before you can use the tutorial, you must manually install the tutorial
files. To install the tutorial, follow these steps:
<P>
NOTE: The following commands assume that Word is installed in the Winword
folder on the C drive of your computer. If this is not the case, modify
each of the given commands appropriately to indicate the location of Word
for Windows.

<OL><P><LI>At the MS-DOS or OS/2 prompt, change to the Word program directory. For
    example:
<P>
      c:
      cd \winword

<P><LI>Use the MS-DOS MD command to create a directory called "WORDCBT". For
    example:
<P>
      md wordcbt

<P><LI>Insert Word Setup Disk 1 into your floppy disk drive (in the steps
    below, drive A is assumed).

<P><LI>Copy EXTRACT.EXE to your Word for Windows program directory. For
    example:
<P>
       copy a:\extract.exe c:\winword
<P>
    NOTE: Office 4.2 may use either the Decomp.exe or Extract.exe
    command to decompress CAB files; therefore, you need to look on
    disk #1 to determine which command is being used. If Decomp.exe
    is on disk #1, use Decomp in the above example; if Extract.exe
    is on disk #1, use the above example.

<P><LI>Insert Word Setup Disk 7 into drive A.

<P><LI>Type the following MS-DOS command:
<P>
    Word for Windows
    ----------------
<P>
       extract a:\word7.cab sample*.* new*.doc *.dex *.les cbt*.*
       wn*.wmf winners.doc wordcbt.cbt fx.dll /l c:\winword\wordcbt
<P>
    Office 4.3
    ----------
<P>
       extract a:\msoff23.cab sample*.* new*.doc *.dex *.les cbt*.*
       winners.doc wordcbt.cbt fx.dll /l c:\winword\wordcbt
<P>
       NOTES: wn*.wmf files are found on msoff31.cab
<P>
       In Office 4.3, the tutorial is on disk #23; in Office 4.2,
       the tutorial is on disk #16, so use the appropriate disk
       number (msoff23.cab or msoff16.cab) in the above command .
<P>
       Office 4.2 may use either the Decomp.exe or Extract.exe
       command to decompress CAB files; therefore, you need to
       look on disk #1 to determine which command is being used.
       If Decomp.exe is on disk #1, use Decomp in the above
       example; if Extract.exe is on disk #1, use the above example.
<P>
    After extracting these files you no longer need to have
    EXTRACT.EXE in your Word for Windows folder. If you would like to
    remove it, type the following:
<P>
      del c:\winword\extract.exe
<P>
</OL>Before you can use the tutorial feature use the following procedure to
define the location of the tutorial files in Word.

<OL><P><LI>Start Word for Windows.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the File Locations tab.

<P><LI>From the File Types list, select Tutorial.

<P><LI>Click Modify.

<P><LI>In the Location Of Tutorial box, type a full path to the location of the
   tutorial files. For example, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\winword\wordcbt
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Click Close.
<P>
</OL>The tutorial is now installed and configured. To activate the tutorial,
click Quick Preview or Examples And Demos on the Help menu.
<P>
Do not use these features unless Word is running in a full screen WIN-OS/2
session.
