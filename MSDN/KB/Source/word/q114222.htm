<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The phrase "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" appears in Microsoft TrueType Font
Assistant for each example of the fonts available. This phrase has the
appearance of an intelligent Latin idiom. Actually, it's nonsense.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Although the phrase is nonsense, it does have a long history. The phrase
has been used for several centuries by typographers to show the most
distinctive features of their fonts. It's used because the letters involved
and the letter spacing in those combinations, reveal at their best, the
weight, design, and other important features of the typeface.
<P>
A 1994 issue of "Before &amp; After" magazine traces "Lorem ipsum" to a jumbled
Latin version of a passage from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum, a treatise
on the theory of ethics written by Cicero in 45 BC. The passage "Lorem
ipsum" is taken from text that reads, "Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem
ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit...," which
translates as, "There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it
and wants to have it, simply because it is pain...."
<P>
During the 1500s, a printer adapted Cicero's text to develop a page of type
samples. Since then, the Latin-like text has been the printing industry's
standard for fake, or dummy, text. Before electronic publishing, graphic
designers had to mock up layouts by drawing in squiggled lines to indicate
text. The advent of self-adhesive sheets preprinted with "Lorem ipsum" gave
a more realistic way to indicate where text would go on a page.
