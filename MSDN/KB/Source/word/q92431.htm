<LI>Documentation Updates
<P>
</UL><h2>General Notes</h2>
 
<P>
Using the Toolbar and the Bullet,
<P><h3>Addresses, and Create Envelope Commands</h3>
 
<P>
The Toolbar is a separate module from the main Word program. Because
the Bullet, Addresses, and Create Envelope commands are also part of
this module, you must install the Toolbar to use these commands. Word
stores addresses that you store with the Addresses command in the Word
Toolbar Prefs file. You may want to make a backup copy of this file to
avoid losing stored addresses in the event a problem occurs with your
computer or hard disk. If your Macintosh is running System 7 software,
the Word Toolbar Prefs file is stored in the Preferences folder in the
System folder. If your Macintosh is running System 6 software, the
Word Toolbar Prefs file is stored in the System folder.
<P>
Note: Unlike the Ribbon and Ruler commands on the View menu, a check
mark does not appear next to the Toolbar command when the Toolbar is
displayed.
<P>
<P><h3>Avoiding Unwanted Drop-Cap Formatting</h3>
 
<P>
The Drop Cap command inserts a frame around text that it formats as a
dropped capital letter, or "drop cap," and also inserts a new
paragraph mark with the frame. This new paragraph inherits formatting
from the paragraph that originally contained the drop cap, which can
sometimes lead to unwanted results. For example, if you use the Drop
Cap command to create a drop cap for a paragraph with a border, the
drop cap also will have a border. In this case, you could use the
Border command (Format menu) to remove the border, or create the drop
cap for a paragraph before you apply border formatting to it.
<P>
<P><h3>Observing Unexpected Color Changes While Using Microsoft Graph</h3>
 
<P>
Because of the way the Macintosh manages colors between applications,
colors may change on a color monitor when you use Graph to edit a
chart in Word. When you quit Graph and return to Word, the chart
regains its original colors.
<P>
<P><h3>Inserting Characters Using the Symbol Font</h3>
 
<P>
To easily insert a character using the Symbol font, choose the Symbol
command from the Insert menu. Then choose the Symbol font from the
Font menu and select the character you want in the Symbol dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Increasing Available Space On the Word Menu Bar</h3>
 
<P>
You can increase the amount of space available on the Word menu bar by
selecting the Use Short Menu Names check box, a View option in the
Preferences dialog box (Tools menu). This option is especially useful
if you have a monitor with a screen that is less than 13 inches wide.
<P>
<P><h3>Printing White Text on a Black Background</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to print white text on a black background, choose Print
from the File menu, and then select the Color/Grayscale option button.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Improvements in Word Version 5.1</h2>
 
<P>
This section lists improvements to Word that are not described in the
What's New in Microsoft Word Version 5.1 manual.
<P>
<P><h3>Saving Hard Disk Space When Installing Word</h3>
 
<P>
Word version 5.1 provides two installation options, Minimal and
PowerBook, to make it easier to install Word in a configuration that
requires a minimal amount of space on your hard disk. The ReadMe
Before Installation file lists the files that are installed with these
options, as do the comments at the bottom of the Customize dialog box
in the Installer program.
<P>
<P><h3>Subscribing to an Edition and Updating a Subscriber</h3>
 
<P>
You can specify the format you want to use for a subscriber by using
the Subscribe With list box in the Subscribe To dialog box. The
default format is Best Format, which varies according to the edition
format and system considerations, such as the amount of available
memory. Other choices include Formatted Text (RTF), Unformatted Text,
and Picture. When you update a subscriber, you can maintain character
and paragraph formatting you have applied to the subscriber by
selecting the Keep Subscriber Formatting Changes check box in the
Subscriber Options dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Updating a Link</h3>
 
<P>
When you update a link, you can maintain character and paragraph
formatting you have applied to linked text by selecting the Keep Link
Formatting Changes check box in the Link Options dialog box. For
example, if you apply right alignment formatting to a linked paragraph
and then update the link, the paragraph will remain right aligned.
<P>
<P><h3>Moving a Document to a Different Computer</h3>
 
<P>
In Word version 5.0, fonts sometimes changed when you moved a document
from the computer on which it was created to a different machine. In
Word version 5.1, this problem has been corrected.
<P>
<P><h3>Moving Word to the Macintosh Desktop</h3>
 
<P>
In Word version 5.0, some commands did not function properly if Word
was moved from the original installation folder and placed on the
Macintosh desktop. In Word version 5.1, this problem has been
corrected.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Grammar Command on Some Macintosh Models</h3>
 
<P>
In Word version 5.0, using the Grammar command sometimes caused Word
to quit unexpectedly when running on the Macintosh Plus, SE, Classic,
Portable, and PowerBook 100 models. In Word version 5.1, this problem
has been corrected.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Documentation Updates</h2>
 
<P>
"What's New in Microsoft Word Version 5.1"
<P>
<PRE>   Page 2          Default Buttons for All Screens

   When you display the default Toolbar horizontally on a 9-inch
   screen, the Toolbar has five more buttons than shown in the
   illustration in the "Default Buttons for All Screens" section. The
   Toolbar also contains the Border, Font Up, Font Down, Find File,
   and Replace buttons.

   Page 34          Using Cut, Copy, and Paste to Edit Movie Frames

   You cannot use the Cut command to cut frames from a movie.
