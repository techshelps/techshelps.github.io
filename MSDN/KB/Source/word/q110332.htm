<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a list of changes that occur if you enable the Use Smart
Cut And Paste option in Word 6.0:

<UL><LI>If you have Revision Marks selected, when a word is deleted and marked
   as revised, the space following it is also marked as revised.

<LI>If you select an area that contains a period and two spaces and then
   copy and paste that selection in the document, the two spaces are
   replaced with one space.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Options.

<P><LI>Choose the Edit tab.
