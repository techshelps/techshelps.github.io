The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
   on the following platform: Alpha
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
   on the following platform: Alpha
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you attempt to compile a macro in Microsoft Office 97 on the alpha
platform that references a Visual Basic for Applications runtime function,
you may receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   VBA332.DLL could not be found.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In the process of trying to compile a reference to a Visual Basic for
Applications runtime function, the VB compiler (inside Vba332.dll) tries to
demand-load Vba332.dll. When FX!32 is running, the loading of Vba332.dll
fails.
<P>
The function that tries to load Vba332.dll searches the system path, the
current directory, and also the currently running process. With FX!32
installed, this third search fails and the function is unable to locate the
file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Move the DLLs to a directory on the system path</h3>
 
<P>
Copy the Vba332.dll and Vba3en.dll files from the \Program Files\Microsoft
Office\Shared folder to the \System32 folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Add the Office 97 Applications to the Exception List</h3>
 
<P>
It is possible for native Alpha applications to incorrectly interact with
Digital FX!32 and not behave as expected. If you notice this interaction,
perform the following steps to disable Digital FX!32 for such applications:

<OL><P><LI>From the FX!32 Manager/Options menu, click Preferences.

<P><LI>Click Advanced Preferences and move the insertion point into the box
   labeled, "Disable FX!32 for these applications."

<P><LI>From the end of the list, press ENTER and type the name of the
   application, such as WinWord.exe.
<P>
</OL>This disables FX!32 for the named application. If more than one application
on the computer has the same name, you can provide the specific path,
including the drive and directory.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Digital FX!32, is an x86 binary translator for the Alpha platform. It gives
you the ability to run x86 Win32 applications on Windows NT 4.0 for Alpha.
You can load a 32-bit x86 application on the Alpha, double-click its icon,
and the application runs just as if it were running on a Pentium system.
