[Setup on Windows NT 3.51 (or later)]
<P>
If you are installing on Windows NT 3.51, you will need to obtain an
updated version of an NT 3.51 system file named WINSRV.DLL. This file will
be contained in Service Pack 1 for NT 3.51. The Service Pack will also
address some issues with the Help on Windows NT 3.51 and contain other
enhancements. Once the Service Pack is available, NT 3.51 users will be
able to access it the following way: This file can be obtained by
<P>
For CompuServe (i386 only):

logon anonymous
cd bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt351
bin
get &lt;Latest Service Pack for NT 3.51&gt;
<P>
[Using Help on Windows NT 3.51 Without Service Pack 1]
<P>
If the Answer Wizard is launched from the Help menu when a Help topic or
Help dialog is open, Help may not function.
<P>
When you are working in a Visual Basic Module in Microsoft Excel, you may
not be able to use context sensitive Help. To use Help in a module, use the
Answer Wizard or the online Help index.
<P>
[Removing Earlier Word Version's Help Files From Path statement]
<P>
On a machine with both Word 95 and a previous version of Word, Word 95 may
load the previous version's Help files. To correct this, edit the Path
statement in AUTOEXEC.BAT to remove the reference to the previous version's
directory location.
<P>
[Using Disks with Distribution Media Format (DMF)]
<P>
With the exception of the Setup disk (Disk 1), your Word disks use a new
format called DMF (Distribution Media Format). DMF increases the capacity
of a 3.5-inch floppy disk, which reduces the number of disks needed to
install your application and speeds up installation.
<P>
Because DMF is a new format, many existing utilities such as Norton Disk
Doctor, Microsoft ScanDisk, MS-DOS DiskCopy, and Microsoft Windows Copy
Disk do not recognize DMF. You should NOT use disk utilities to examine a
DMF formatted disk, as these utilities can corrupt the DMF disk. You cannot
copy DMF formatted disks using MS-DOS DiskCopy or Microsoft Windows Copy
Disk ( If you want to copy files from the Setup disks, see "Extracting
Files from DMF Disks," later in this file.).
<P>
Windows 95, Windows 3.1 (or later), and Windows NT 3.5 (or later) support
DMF.
<P>
If there is a chance that your system has a virus, you should run a
recently updated virus detection utility such as F-prot before installing
Word for Windows 95. Otherwise Disk 2 and higher may become infected with
the virus.
Extracting Files from DMF Disks
<P>
If you need to copy the Word disks onto a network server or other
permanent storage drive, you may use the copy switch (/C) with the
EXTRACT.EXE utility on Disk 1 to copy the Word installation files to the
target location.
<P>
For example, after creating a directory called C:\DISKS on your hard disk
drive for the
Word files, copy all the files on Disk 1 to that directory. (Since Disk 1
does not use DMF, you can use the standard MS-DOS Copy command, COPY
A:\*.* C:\DISKS.) Switch to drive A and type the following command to copy
the
rest of the disks to the directory C:\DISKS:
<P>
FOR %I IN (*.*) DO C:\DISKS\EXTRACT /C A:\%I C:\DISKS\%I
<P>
A cabinet (.CAB) file includes many files stored as a single file. If you
need only a single file that is contained in one of the cabinet files, you
may search for it using the /D switch with EXTRACT.EXE. Once you find the
file, you can use EXTRACT.EXE again to copy the file to the desired
location. You can also type EXTRACT /? to get help on the EXTRACT command
options. Here are some examples of how to use the EXTRACT command to find
files.
<P>
<PRE> To list all files in a cabinet file:

</PRE>EXTRACT /D A:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt;
<P>
To list all EXE files in a cabinet file:
<P>
EXTRACT /D A:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt; *.EXE
<P>
Here are some examples of how to use EXTRACT to copy a single file out of a
cabinet file.
<P>
To extract ANY.EXE to the current directory:
<P>
EXTRACT A:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt; ANY.EXE
<P>
To extract ANY.EXE to C:\OFFICE:
<P>
EXTRACT A:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt; /L C:\OFFICE ANY.EXE
<P>
[Printing EPS files in Windows 95 or Windows NT]
<P>
In both Windows 95 and Windows NT, 32-bit Word documents containing EPS
files do not print properly. Both the bitmap preview and the EPS file will
print, one on top of the other. The workaround for this in both Windows 95
and Windows NT, is to manually take out the PostScript code from the bitmap
preview. To do this, open the PostScript bitmap in a text editor.
<P>
[Equation Editor]
<P>
MathType is a trademark of Design Science, Inc.
Equation Editor 2.0, a special version of the MathType equation editor from
Design Science, Inc., is customized for use with Microsoft applications,
such as Microsoft [nameofyourapplication] for the
[nameoftheoperatingsystem]. If you work a lot with equations, you may find
that the extended version of Equation Editor is better suited to your
needs. This version includes customizable palettes, a macro feature,
advanced formatting based on tabs, a TeX interface, and the capability for
saving equations as either encapsulated PostScript (EPS) or PICT files.

<P>
[Lotus cc:Mail or Lotus Notes]
<P>
Word supports Vendor Independent Messaging (VIM) 1.0, which means that you
can use the Send and Add/Edit Routing Slip commands (File menu) in Word to
send or route Word documents with mail applications such as Lotus cc:Mail
that support VIM 1.0.  Lotus cc:Mail 1.11 users may get VIM support files
from Lotus. In order for Word to use VIM mail applications the DOS PATH
command in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file must include the directory in which the
mail application's VIM support files are stored.  If the PATH does not
include the directory containing the VIM support files then setup will not
install VIM support for Word and Word will not function correctly when
sending mail.  The Word support files for VIM 1.0 are called MAPIVI32.DLL
and MAPIVITK.DLL, and both are installed in the System subdirectory of the
Windows program directory.
<P>
There are known problems with Lotus Notes 3.3 TCP/IP network protocol
support which are being addressed in a future version of Lotus Notes. These
problems will prevent Word from sending mail through the current versions
of 16 bit Lotus Notes when Lotus Notes is using TCP/IP as its network
protocol.  Using a protocol other than TCP/IP solves the problem.
<P>
[Field Codes: Bookmark and REF Fields]
<P>
The Help topic "Field Codes: Bookmark and Ref Fields" is incomplete. You
must use the REF field when using the field switches \f and \n. The example
in the description of the \f field switch should be { REF Footnote1 \f }
where "Footnote1" is the bookmark marking the footnote reference mark of
footnote 1.
<P>
[Using Word 6.0 or Word 2.0 Templates with Word for Windows 95]
<P>
When you install Word for Windows 95, you will find that your old templates
will now appear in the File New dialog box under either the "Shortcut to
Old" or the "Shortcut to Workgroup" tabs. During installation, Setup
locates both your user and workgroup templates' locations and creates a
shortcut folder for each location. The shortcuts are stored in the Office
Templates folder, usually c:\MSOFFICE\TEMPLATES. If Setup does not find a
workgroup templates location, no shortcut folder will be created for it.
<P>
Example:
c:\WINWORD\TEMPLATE --&gt; C:\MSOFFICE\TEMPLATES\shortcut to old
\\USER\WORKGRP\TEMPLATE --&gt; c:\MSOFFICE\TEMPLATES\shortcut to workgroup
<P>
To use your old templates you can simply choose New from the File menu,
click on either the "Shortcut to Old" or "Shortcut to Workgroup" tab, then
choose your template name from the list of available templates.
<P>
To rename the File New tabs that point to your previous templates, use the
Windows Explorer to locate the "Shortcut to Old" or "Shortcut toWorkgroup"
folder and click once on the folder name. You can then type in a new name
which will appear as the name of the tab in the File New dialog.
<P>
CAUTION: Deleting your previous templates directory will delete your
previous templates. To best preserve your particular configuration Setup
does not copy or move your previous templates from their original location
to the Office templates directory. Be sure to copy or move your previous
templates before deleting the original directory.
<P>
[Word for Windows 95 default setup options]
<P>
If you want to find out what is contained in the Typical installation of
Word for Windows 95, choose the Custom option in Setup and look at the
default settings. These defaults are what is included in the Typical
installation.
The following are some of the options that are not installed when you
perform a Typical installation of Word:
Equation Editor
EPS graphics filter
GIF filter
Grammar
WordArt
Find All Word Forms (in the Edit Find/Replace dialog)
<P>
[Using Foreign Language Proofing Tools with Word for Windows 95]
<P>
Supplemental Foreign language proofing tools purchased for use with Word
6.0 will work with Word for Windows 95. However, when you proof a document
that has foreign language formatting in Word for Windows 95, Word may not
be able to locate the foreign language dictionary file. If you encounter
this problem, copy or move the foreign language dictionary file indicated
in the error message to the following folder: \Program Files\Common
Files\Microsoft Shared\Proof. In most cases, the indicated file will be
located in the folder: \windows\msapps\proof.
<P>
To acquire additional language dictionaries, contact:

<P>
[Using Microsoft Bookshelf 1994 with Word for Windows 95]
<P>
The Microsoft Bookshelf 1994 integration tools used in Word 6.0 will not
work with Word for Windows 95. If you wish to use these products together,
you should install the Bookshelf Quickshelf toolbar.  Bookshelf 1995 will
have enhanced Word integration features.  Contact your local reseller or
<PRE>call    the Microsoft Sales Information Center at 1-800-426-9400  for
</PRE>information about obtaining the updated version of Bookshelf.
<P>
[WordBasic Errors with Word 6.0 Add-ins and Macros]
<P>
When you upgrade to Word for Windows 95 you may encounter one of the
following error messages while working within Word:
<P>
<PRE>     WordBasic Error = 582: Unable to load specified library

     or

     WordBasic Error = : Invalid library

</PRE>The most likely cause for this is when you have outdated Global Add-ins or
Templates installed in the File Templates dialog. Some macros and add-ins
are designed to run on 16-bit Windows 3.x and cannot be run on 32-bit
operating systems like Windows 95. Contact the add-in vendor or macro
author for an update. For more information type "WordBasic error 582" in
the Help Find dialog.
<P>
[WordMail Information]
<P>
By default WordMail uses the EMAIL template for composing and editing
notes. This template is located in your Word templates directory, usually
C:\MSOFFICE\WINWORD. You can customize toolbars, menus, and boilerplate
text in the EMAIL template by opening it in Word and modifying it as you
would any other Word template.
<P>
You can switch your default email editor from WordMail to the Exchange
editor by choosing Compose, WordMail Options and checking or clearing the
"Enable Word as Email Editor" check box.
<P>
Please note that WordMail requires 12 MB RAM. Using WordMail on systems
with less memory will result in poor performance.
<P>
[ODBC Not Included with Word for Windows 95]
<P>
The Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) files that provide easy access to
databases created by programs like Microsoft Access, SQL Server, and
Paradox, are not included with standalone Word for Windows 95. Access to
dBASE or FoxPro files is provided by the dBASE converter you can install
via the Custom setup option. Word can use the 32-bit ODBC files included
with Word for Windows 95 and Microsoft Access for Windows 95. You can also
obtain the 32-bit ODBC Drivers Application Note from Microsoft Product
Support Services. For more information on obtaining this application note
refer to the Supplemental Offers Coupon included in this package.
<P>
[Windows 95 for Pen Computing]
<P>
Support for Windows 95 for Pen Computing is not implemented in Word for
Windows 95.
<P>
[Updates to Getting Results with Microsoft Office for Windows 95]
<P>
The following are changes that occurred after the book went to press. The
page numbers listed are those in the Getting Results with Microsoft Office
for Windows 95. For those who purchased Word as a separate package, the
page number is in parentheses.
<P>
Graphics filters licensed from Henderson Software, Inc., are not part of
the product and should not be on the copyright page.
<P>
Pages 27 and 29 (pages 8 and 10): The correct online location of the
Network Install Readme is in the Getting Help section of the Word online
Help table of contents.
<P>
Page 28 (page 9): The name of the Remove button has been changed to the
Add/Remove button. Therefore, step 5 should read, "Click the Office
application (click Word), and click the Add/Remove button.
<P>
Page 29 (page 10) The correct procedure for starting Word is "click the
Start button, click Programs, and then click Word."
<P>
Page 126: The instructions for starting the Memo Wizard should read, "Click
the Memos tab, and then double-click the Memo Wizard." (This is correct in
Getting Results with Microsoft Word for Windows 95.)
<P>
Page 538: The reference to the AutoText toolbar button is incorrect.
Instead, you need to click AutoText (Edit menu) to insert AutoText entries.
To learn how to add AutoText (or other tools) to a toolbar, see page 503.
(This is correct in Getting Results with Microsoft Word for Windows 95.)
