The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Assistant for Word, version 2.0z
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open an HTML document that contains a CDR or WPG image, Internet
Assistant hangs (stops responding). If you are running Windows NT, Internet
Assistant hangs immediately. If you are running Windows 95, any of the
following symptoms may occur before Internet Assistant hangs:

<UL><LI>An invalid page fault or stack fault error occurs.

<LI>The picture is not displayed when you return from HTML source view.

<LI>Word appears to hang and the status bar displays the message: "This
   command is not available because of a memory or disk problem."

<LI>When you close and then reopen Word, the toolbars are missing.

<LI>The "WordBasic Err=23, Cannot write to disk" error is displayed.

<LI>The Image Not Loaded button is displayed instead of the picture.
<P>
   NOTE: This button appears for other, non-critical reasons, such as when
   the inserted images cannot be displayed. For example, this button
   appears in the following scenarios:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - You insert a video file, save, close and reopen your document.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - You save a file to your hard drive that you browsed. When you save
      the file, Internet Assistant does not save images that are referenced
      in that file.
</PRE><P>
</UL>This problem does not occur when you convert a Word document that contains
these image types to HTML.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Access Softek
converter used by Microsoft Internet Assistant for Word, version 2.0z.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To use CDR or WPG images in an HTML document, use one of the following
workarounds to first convert the image to another format.
<P>
Method 1: Insert the CDR or WPG image in a Word document and then
<PRE>          convert the Word document to HTML format. Click the Save
          Pictures button when prompted to convert the image. Insert the
          resulting GIF image in your HTML document. As Word converts
          these images, it assigns a file name such as Img00001.gif,
          Img00002.gif, Img00003.gif, and so on. After the conversion,
          you can do one of the following:

           - Use the HTML document. This document contains pointers to
             the converted GIF images.

             -or-

           - Insert the converted GIF images in a new or existing HTML
             document.

</PRE>Method 2: Use a graphics program to export the CDR or WPG image to GIF
<PRE>          or JPG format and then insert the GIF or JPG image into your
          HTML document.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The most common graphics file formats on the web are GIF, JPG, and XBM.
When you use Internet Assistant to design a page for the Web, use either
GIF or JPG images. These images are supported by graphical browsers.
Internet Assistant will not display XBM images because it does not have
a filter to display them, but you can use this format.
<P>
Avoid using other formats, such as BMP, CDR, CGM, DRW, DXF, EPS, HGL, PCD,
PCX, PLT, TGA, TIF, WMF, and WPG, which are not currently supported by web
browsers. Although Internet Assistant provides a graphics converter that
allows you to convert images to GIF format, the conversion occurs when you
save a Word document as HTML. When you save an existing HTML document,
images are not converted because the HTML document does not actually
contain the image. Instead, the document points to the location of the
image on your disk drive.
