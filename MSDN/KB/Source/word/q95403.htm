The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Word for Windows, when you use the Create Envelope command to print a
Number 10 envelope using the Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet printer driver
(DESKJETC.DRV) version 3.0 or 3.1 on the HP DeskJet 550C or 560C printer,
the envelope may print incorrectly. If you set a printer heuristic (+544),
envelopes may print correctly. To ensure that your envelope prints
correctly every time, however, use one of the following printer drivers
supplied by Microsoft and set a printer heuristic (+544):

<UL><LI>Microsoft HP DeskJet 540c, 550C, or 560C (monochrome) printer driver
   version 2.0 (HPDSKJET.DRV). This driver ships with Windows for
   Workgroups.

<LI>Microsoft HP DeskJet printer driver version 2.1 (HPDSKJET.DRV)
   dated 12/07/92, available from the MSDL.
<P>
</UL>Word for Windows version 6.0 does not use printer hueristics to contol
printer functionality.  To change printer functionality choose Options
from the Envelopes and Lables dialog box.  Under the Envelope Options
dialog box categoty Printing Options you can set the Feed method
(orientation and location) of the envelope.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft recommends that you use the Microsoft HP DeskJet 540c, 550C, or
560C (monochrome) printer driver version 2.0 or printer driver version 2.1
to print envelopes using the Create Envelope command in Word for Windows.
When you use one of these Microsoft printer drivers, you must set the
HPDSKJET=+544 printer heuristic to print envelopes correctly. See the
"Printer Heuristic DESKJETC=+544 and HPDSKJET=+544" section below for
information.

<UL><LI>The HPDSKJET.DRV version 2.0 printer driver is supplied with
   Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1.

<LI>The HPDSKJET.DRV version 2.10 printer driver is available via modem
   from the MSDL (Microsoft Download Service), at (425) 936-6735.
   Download the file titled, HPDSKJET.EXE.
<P>
</UL>If you are printing any size envelopes except COM-10 to an HP Deskjet 1200C
printer using version 2.20 of the driver (HPPCL5E.DRV), you may need to set
a printer heuristic of HPPCL5C=+548  in order to get them to print
correctly.  This heuristic may not work with all custom size envelopes.
For these envelopes, you must format a letter size document for landscape,
and then increase the top and left margins to create a working area the
size of the envelope.
<P>

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><h3>Troubleshooting Incorrect Envelope Output</h3>
 
<P>
When your envelope prints incorrectly, one of the following occurs:

<UL><LI>Word displays the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Margins are set outside of the Unprintable Region.
</PRE><P>
   If you choose the OK button, your envelope prints in the correct
   position, but the address may be truncated.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The envelope address does not print on the envelope at all. When
   this  happens, the envelope may be printing on the left instead of
   the right side of the printer. To determine whether the envelope
   address is printing on the left side of the printer or not at all,
   print the envelope on a piece of letter-sized paper.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Using the printer driver version 2.10, the envelope must placed into
   the paper tray the opposite direction of the diagram in the paper
   tray of the printer. If the envelope is placed in the tray
   correctly, the address will print in the opposite corner of the
   envelope.
<P>
</UL>If nothing prints on the letter-sized paper, check the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Options. Under the Print Category, make
   sure these settings are correct:
<P>
   a. The Reverse Print Order option should be cleared.
<P>
   b. The Draft Output option should be cleared.

<P><LI>Note: This setting applies only to the Microsoft HP DeskJet 540c, 550c,
   or 560c printer driver versions 1.2 (DESKJET.DRV), 2.0 (HPDSKJET.DRV),
   and 2.10 (HPDSKJET.DRV)
<P>
   From the File menu, choose Print Setup. Select the DeskJet printer
   and choose the Setup button. The Resolution setting should be 300
   DPI.

<P><LI>If the envelope feeds through the printer blank, check to ensure
   that the 1.1 (DESKJET.DRV) version of the driver is not being used.
   This driver shipped with Windows version 3.1. This driver does not
   support the DeskJet 550.
<P>
</OL><h3>Printer Heuristic DESKJETC=+544 and HPDSKJET=+544</h3>
 
<P>
If your envelope address prints on the left instead of the right side of
the printer, heuristic DESKJETC=+544 may correct the problem. This printer
heuristic sometimes, but not always, prints envelopes correctly on the
DeskJet 540c, 550c, or 560c. Heuristic 544 forces Windows to print the
envelope in reverse landscape orientation. Without this printer heuristic,
the DeskJet 540c, 550c, or 560c prints envelopes in portrait mode by
default. The following are the heuristics used for the HP DeskJet 550c:

<UL><LI>Using the printer driver DESKJET.DRV from HP:  Deskjetc=+544

<LI>Using either printer driver from Microsoft:    HPDSKJET=+544
<P>
</UL>For information on setting printer heuristics, query on the following
words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   newmacro.doc and functionality and printer and heuristics
