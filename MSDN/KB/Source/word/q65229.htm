The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Pressing the F7 function key in Word for Windows versions 1.0, 1.1,
and 1.1a does not perform exactly the same command as choosing
Spelling from the Utilities menu.
<P>
In Word for Windows version 2.0, pressing the F7 key also differs
from choosing Spelling from the Tools menu.
<P>
In Word for Windows version 2.0, pressing F7 checks only the current
selection or the word closest to the insertion point, as in versions
1.0, 1.1, and 1.1a. However, after a single word has been checked, the
message "XXXX" is spelled correctly. Do you want to continue checking
the remainder of document?" appears. When a selection of text has been
checked by pressing F7, the message "Word finished checking the
selection. Do you want to continue checking the remainder of
document?" appears.
<P>
Pressing the F7 key always gives you the option to continue checking
the rest of the document.
<P>
If you choose Spelling from the Utilities menu in Word for Windows
versions 1.x, Word performs a spelling check on the selected text
only. If no text is selected, the entire document is spell checked.
<P>
If you choose Spelling from the Tools menu in Word for Windows version
2.0, only the selected text is spell checked. However, the option to
continue checking the rest of the document appears after the selected
text is checked. If no text is selected, choosing Tools Spelling runs
the spelling check for the entire document.
<P>
Word for Windows 6.0
 
<P>
If the insertion point is on or near a word and you press F7 in Word
for Windows 6.0 to spell check, the spell checker will flag the next
word that it does not find in the dictionary. If you have a word
selected that is spelled correctly, Word will display the message,
"Word finished checking the selection. Do you want to continue
checking the remainder of the document." If the word is misspelled
and you press F7 while the misspelled word is selected Word will flag
the word. After the user has performed a change or ignore on the word
the message, "Word finished checking the selection. Do you want to
continue checking the remainder of the document?".
