 MICROSOFT OFFERS NEW SUPPORT OPTION FOR FORMER
 WORDPERFECT USERS MOVING TO WORD FOR WINDOWS
 ==========================================================================

 REDMOND, Wash. — Feb. 16, 1994 — Microsoft Corporation announced
 today that on February 22nd it will roll out a special telephone
 support option for former users of WordPerfect(R) for MS-DOS(R) who
 switch to Microsoft(R) Word for Windows(TM). Callers to the standard
 support service for Microsoft Word will be given the option to
 connect to a support engineer specifically trained on WordPerfect
 product and customer issues. The new telephone support option was
 created to assist the more than one-million users of WordPerfect who
 have already moved to Microsoft Word for Windows as well as those
 expected to make the switch.

 "With the recent WordPerfect Corporation announcements that they are
 ending their lifetime free support and discontinuing development of
 their MS-DOS-based word processor, we wanted to prepare for an
 upsurge in interest in Word from WordPerfect users," said Pete
 Higgins, senior vice president, desktop applications division at
 Microsoft. "We believe this new support option will help ensure that
 WordPerfect users moving to Word get their questions answered quickly
 and effectively."

 Over the past two years, Word has emerged as the new word processing
 leader, garnering both critical acclaim and increasing market
 success. In January, Word was named the best selling word processor
 for 1993 by Dataquest (based on preliminary estimates of worldwide
 revenue), and just this month, Word for Windows version 6.0 won both
 the InfoWorld and Windows Sources word processing comparative
 reviews.

 New Support Option Focuses on Issues
 Important to Former Users of WordPerfect
 ----------------------------------------

 The new support option for former WordPerfect users will focus on
 getting users comfortable, as well as helping them with file
 conversion and other transition issues. The designated support
 engineers at Microsoft undergo comprehensive training to gain a solid
 understanding of WordPerfect features and terminology. This knowledge
 allows the engineers to best meet users' needs.

 Microsoft Word Designed with Former Users of WordPerfect in Mind
 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 Microsoft Word 6.0 for Windows includes a number of features created
 specifically for former users of WordPerfect. The Help for
 WordPerfect feature lets users enter a familiar WordPerfect command
 and then watch as Word for Windows demonstrates how to perform the
 equivalent function in Word--enabling users to learn as they work.
 The robust file import and export is based on research compiled from
 more than 1,000 documents collected from users of WordPerfect. Word
 for Windows even has a "Reveal Formats" similar to WordPerfect's
 Reveal Codes feature.

 "We know there can be some concern when moving to a new product, so
 we've done everything we can to make former users of WordPerfect feel
 comfortable in their new environment," said Chris Peters, vice
 president, Office business unit at Microsoft. "If they need product
 support, they'll find top-notch engineers trained to meet their
 needs."

 Microsoft Word 6.0 for Windows is available as a standalone product
 or through the Microsoft Office. Microsoft Office Standard Edition
 for Windows includes Word, Microsoft Excel, the PowerPoint
 presentation graphics program, and a workstation license for
 Microsoft Mail (server software available separately). Microsoft
 Office Professional Edition for Windows includes all of the above
 plus the Microsoft Access database management system.

 In addition to this enhanced level of technical support for
 WordPerfect users, all users of Microsoft desktop applications have
 access to unlimited, no-charge telephone support via toll lines, 6:00
 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time, Monday through Friday. One convenient
 phone number reaches Microsoft technical support services for all
 programs in the Microsoft Office.

 Founded in 1975, Microsoft (NASDAQ "MSFT") is the worldwide leader in
 software for personal computers. The company offers a wide range of
 products and services for business and personal use, each designed
 with the mission of making it easier and more enjoyable for people to
 take advantage of the full power of personal computing every day.
