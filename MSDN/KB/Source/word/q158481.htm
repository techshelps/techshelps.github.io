<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a Word 97 document in Word 6.x or 7.x, if that document
contains floating objects and was saved in either Microsoft Word 6.x/95
format or Rich Text Format (RTF), the objects are stacked one on top of the
other on the first page.
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur when you save a Word 97 document that
contains inline objects into Microsoft Word 6.x/95 or RTF formats.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During conversion, the objects become detached from their original
anchors.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, save the document in Word 97 native format,
and install the Word 97 converter on the computer where you have Word 6.x
or 7.x installed. When you open the document, the objects will be
positioned correctly.
<P>
If you have access to the Word 97 or Office 97 CD-ROM, copy the
Wrd97cnv.exe file from the CD-ROM to a folder on your hard disk. Double-
click the Wrd97cnv.exe file to extract and setup the converter.
<P>
Depending on which version of Word you are currently using, the Setup
program installs either the Mswrd832.cnv file (the 32-bit version for Word
95) or the Msword8.cnv file (the 16-bit version for Word 6.0). This program
also updates the necessary registry settings. For more information, see the
Readme file that is installed with the Word 97 converter.
<P>
If you do not have access to the CD-ROM, you can obtain the Word 97
converter, free of charge, via one of the following methods.
