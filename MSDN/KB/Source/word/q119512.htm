The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following error message may occur when you run the Word 6.0a for
Windows upgrade patch (UPGRADE.EXE):
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to Find the STF in the Win.Ini

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The patch setup looks for one of two entries in the [MS Setup (ACME) Table
Files] section of the WIN.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   WINWORD.EXE@v6.0.0.2226(1033)=C:\WINWORD\SETUP\SETUP.STF

   or

   MSOFFICE.EXE@v1.0.0.000(1033)=C:\MSOFFICE\SETUP\SETUP.STF

</PRE>If neither of these two lines exist, or if they are not specified exactly
as above, the error message will occur.
<P>
There are four common scenarios where this may occur:

<OL><P><LI>You have already upgraded your Word 6.0 installation to Word 6.0a or
    6.0c. In other words, Word 6.0a or 6.0c is already installed on your
    computer, so you do not need to run UPGRADE.EXE. If you have already
    upgraded to Word 6.0a the line will read:
<P>
       WINWORD.EXE@v6.0.0.2513(1033)=C:\WINWORD\SETUP\SETUP.STF
<P>
    The Word 6.0c will read:
<P>
       WINWORD.EXE@v6.0.0.3015(1033)=C:\WINWORD\SETUP\SETUP.STF
<P>
    NOTE: The retail version of Microsoft Office 4.2 for Windows installs
    Word 6.0a. If you have Office 4.2, you have already installed Word
    6.0a, so you do not need to run the UPGRADE.EXE patch on your system.

<P><LI>If you have installed the Canadian version of US/English Word 6.0 for
    Windows. In this case, the following line may appear in the [MS Setup
    (ACME) Table Files] section of the WIN.INI:
<P>
<PRE>        WINWORD.EXE@v6.0.0.2226(1033A)=C:\WINWORD\SETUP\SETUP.STF

    This line is nearly identical to the correct line. The only difference
    is the addition of the "A" in the (1033) identifier. The US Word 6.0a
    patch is completely compatible with the Canadian English version of
    Word 6.0 for Windows, so temporarily removing the "A" from this line,
    running the patch, then reinserting the "A" after completing the
    upgrade is acceptable.

</PRE><P><LI>The above Word 6.0a for Windows patch error may occur if you have
    Microsoft Office version 4.2 for Windows on your computer if you
    installed it in the following specific sequence:
<P>
    a. You installed the full retail Office 4.0 package--not the Office 4.0
       upgrade package.
<P>
    b. You installed the Office 4.2 upgrade--not the full retail Office 4.2
       package.
<P>
    c. Then you tried to upgrade to Word 6.0a for Windows using the
       Word 6.0a Patch.
<P>
  4. You have an installed verison of Word 6.0c and you attempted to
     install the Word 6.0a Patch.

   TITLE     : Word 6.0a Patch Fails After Installing Office 4.2

</PRE></OL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you have already installed Word 6.0a for Windows on your system
    there is no need to run the UPGRADE.EXE patch.

<P><LI>If you have the Canadian version installed simply temporarily remove
    the "A" from the following line in the [MS Setup (ACME) Table Files] in
    the WIN.INI (always backup WIN.INI before making any modifications to
    it):
<P>
    WINWORD.EXE@v6.0.0.2226(1033A)=C:\WINWORD\SETUP\SETUP.STF
<P>
    so that it looks like this:
<P>
    WINWORD.EXE@v6.0.0.2226(1033)=C:\WINWORD\SETUP\SETUP.STF
<P>
    Run the UPGRADE.EXE patch. After upgrading to Word 6.0a, reopen the
    WIN.INI file, replace the "A" in the above line, then save and close
    the WIN.INI file.

<P><LI>If you upgraded to Microsoft Office 4.2 by following the steps listed
    above under CAUSE you must do the following in order to run the Word
    6.0a patch:
<P>
    1. Rename the SETUP.STF file installed by the Office 4.2 upgrade (for
       example, rename the file to SETUP.OLD).
<P>
    2. Reinstall Office 4.0, but choose to only install Word 6.0. You do
       not need to reinstall Microsoft Excel or PowerPoint if you have
       already upgraded to Microsoft Excel 5.0 and PowerPoint 4.0. This
       restores the SETUP.STF file that contains Word 6.0 information.
<P>
    3. Run the Word 6.0a Patch again.
<P>
    4. Upgrade to Office 4.2.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In some cases it may be necessary to reinstall Word 6.0 for Windows then
rerun UPGRADE.EXE.
<P>
To determine what version of Word is installed, choose About Microsoft Word
from the Help menu of Word for Windows.
