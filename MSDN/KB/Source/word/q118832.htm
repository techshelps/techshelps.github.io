The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The WordBasic macro language in Word 6.0 for the Macintosh fails to send
certain non-character keystrokes when using the SendKeys command.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Due to a system limitation, the full set of keystrokes are not supported on
the Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word version 6.0 for the
Macintosh. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following table lists non-character keys that are not available on the
Macintosh when using SendKeys:
<P>
<PRE>   Key                     Sendkeys parameter
   ---                     ------------------
   BACKSPACE               {backspace} or {bs} or {bksp}
   BREAK                   {break}
   CAPS LOCK               {capslock}
   CLEAR                   {clear}
   DEL                     {delete} or {del}
   DOWN ARROW              {down}
   END                     {end}
   HELP                    {help}
   HOME                    {home}
   INS                     {insert}
   LEFT ARROW              {left}
   NUM LOCK                {numlock}
   PAGE DOWN               {pgdn}
   PAGE UP                 {pgup
   PRINT SCREEN            {prtsc}
   RIGHT ARROW             {right}
   UP ARROW                {up}
   F1, F2, F3,...F16       {F1}, {F2}, {F3},...{F16}

</PRE>The SendKeys command sends the keystrokes specified by the user to the next
WordBasic command, just as if the characters were typed at the keyboard.
SendKeys must precede instructions that activate the command that receives
the keystrokes. On a Macintosh, a SendKeys instruction can send no more
than 10 keystrokes and can send them only to Word. SendKeys cannot be used
with another program.
<P>
The following sample macro types a file name, "TESTFILE", in the File Save
As dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MAIN
   SendKeys "TESTFILE"
   Dim dlg As FileSaveAs
   x = Dialog(dlg)
   End Sub

</PRE>NOTE: When stepping through a macro (using the Step or Step Subs button)
that contains a SendKeys instruction, make sure SendKeys and the
instruction following are on the same line, separated by a colon.
