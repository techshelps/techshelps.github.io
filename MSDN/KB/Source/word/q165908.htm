<P>
Microsoft Word Viewer is a freeware program that allows people who do not
own Microsoft Word to view and print documents that were created in Word.
The latest version of Word Viewer can open documents created with all
previous versions of Word for Windows and version 4.x and later of
Microsoft Word for Macintosh. You cannot edit an open document in Word
Viewer; however, you can copy text to the Clipboard to paste it in other
applications. Microsoft encourages you to distribute Word Viewer along with
your Word documents to people who do not have Microsoft Word.
<P>
There are currently four versions of Microsoft Word Viewer available for
download. For more information about each version, see the appropriate
section later in this article.

<UL><LI>Wd97vw32.exe: Word Viewer 97 (32-bit version) allows you to view Word 97
   documents.

<LI>Wdvw9716.exe: Word Viewer 97 for 16-bit Operating Systems (Windows 3.1)
   allows you to view Word 97 documents

<LI>Wd95vw71.exe: Word Viewer version 7.1 (32-bit version) allows you to
   view Word 6 and Word 7 documents.

<LI>Wordvu.exe: Word Viewer version 6 for 16-bit Operating Systems (Windows
   3.1) allows you to view Word 6 and Word 7 documents.

<P>
<P><h3>System Requirements for Word Viewer 97</h3>
 

<UL><LI>A personal computer with a 486 or higher processor
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 operating system or Microsoft
   Windows NT(TM) Workstation operating system 3.51 or later

<P>
</UL><h3>What's New in Microsoft Word Viewer 97</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word Viewer 97 is optimized for displaying Word documents inside
Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x and above. If you have Netscape Navigator
2.x or above, Word Viewer Setup will install a plug-in that allows Word
Viewer 97 to display documents inside the Navigator window. Word Viewer 97
includes the following, market-leading Microsoft Word 97 features:

<UL><LI>Online Layout View for easy reading of online documents, including
   those with background colors and textures.

<LI>Document Map for point-and-click navigation through longer documents.

<LI>Hyperlink navigation to open any hyperlink in a document with your
   installed browser
<P>
</UL><h3>Installing Microsoft Word Viewer 97</h3>
 
<P>
To obtain Word Viewer 97, download Wd97vw32.exe and place it in an empty
folder on your hard disk. Wd97vw32.exe is a compressed, self-extracting
file. After you download Wd97vw32.exe, run it to install Word Viewer.
<P>
To install Microsoft Word Viewer 97, you must have the file Wd97vw32.exe
on your LAN or local hard drive. Close all other applications and ensure
that you are not running any utilities or virus protection programs. In
Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 or the Windows NT 3.51 File Manager, double-
click the Word Viewer icon. This will run an unpack utility that extracts
the Word Viewer 97 distribution files and starts the Word Viewer 97 Setup
program. Follow these instructions to successfully complete the
installation.

<OL><P><LI>Word Viewer 97 Setup will prompt you for a folder in which to install.
   The default folder location for Word Viewer 97 is
   \Program Files\Wordview (C:\WordView on Windows NT 3.51).

<P><LI>After choosing the folder location for Word Viewer, click Install to
   install Word Viewer.

<P><LI>If Word Viewer Setup detects Word for Windows (version 6.0 or later) on
   your system, it will prompt you to determine which application should
   open Word documents by default. For example, the default application is
   used to open files with .doc file extensions when you double-click them
   in Windows 95/Windows NT 4.0 or in the Windows NT 3.51 File Manager.
<P>
</OL><h3>Important</h3>
 
<P>
Choosing "Open with Word" means that Word will be used by default to open
Word files. Choosing "Open with Viewer" means that Word Viewer will be
used by default to open Word files. If you select this option, you will
not be able to use Word as your e-mail editor or edit Word document
objects. However, you will be able to view Word document objects.
<P>
To restore Word as the default Word document handler, you will have to
uninstall Word Viewer as described below and then start Word so that it
can restore its Registry information.

To install Word Viewer 97 for Windows 16-bit Operating Systems, you must
have the file Wdvw9716.exe on your LAN or local hard drive, (or one of the
alternate file sets described in this document under "Distribution of Word
Viewer"). Close all other applications and ensure that you are not running
any utilities or virus protection programs. In Windows File Manager,
double-click the Word Viewer for Windows 16-bit Operating Systems icon.
This will run an unpack utility that extracts the Word Viewer 97
distribution files and start the Word Viewer 97 for Windows 16-bit
Operating Systems Setup program. Follow these instructions to successfully

<OL><P><LI>Installation of Word Viewer is designed to take place from within
   Microsoft Windows. If Windows is not running, please start it before
   continuing. Make sure to close all applications first, and make sure you
   are not running any utilities or virus protection before proceeding. It
   is very important that your computer runs under a Windows 16-bit
   operating system in order to install this version of Word Viewer. The
   Setup application for Word Viewer 97 for 16-bit operating systems
   prevents you from installing Word Viewer in a 32-bit operating system
   like Windows 95 or Windows NT(R). A 32-bit version of Word Viewer 97 is
   also available.

<P><LI>If you have installed Word Viewer from a prior beta, you should first
   uninstall that version before installing this one. For directions on
   uninstall, consult the ReadMe.doc file included with the prior version
   of Word Viewer.

<P><LI>Run the Setup.exe program on disk 1 of Word Viewer or the file
   Wdvw9716.exe if you downloaded the Word Viewer 97 for Windows 16-bit
   Operating Systems from an online service.

<P><LI>Word Viewer Setup will prompt you for a folder in which to install Word
   Viewer or you can simply accept the suggested default location. The
   default folder location for Word Viewer is C:\WORDVIEW.

<P><LI>After choosing the folder location for Word Viewer, click Install to
   install Word Viewer for Windows 16-bit Operating Systems.

<P><LI>If Word Viewer Setup detects Word for Windows version 6.x or later on
   your system, it will prompt you to determine which application should
   open Word documents by default.
<P>
   Important:
<P>
   Choosing "Open with Word" means that Word will be used by default to
   open Word files. Choosing "Open with Viewer" means that Word Viewer for
   Windows 16-bit Operating Systems will be used by default to open Word
   files. If you select this option, you will not be able to use Word as
   your e-mail editor or edit Word document objects.
<P>
   To restore Word as the default Word document handler, you will have to
   uninstall Word Viewer 97 for Windows 16-bit Operating Systems and
   reinstall Word so that it can restore its document handling information.

<P><LI>To run Word Viewer 97 for Windows 16-bit Operating Systems, in File
   Manager, double-click on the WordView.exe file, or create an icon in
   Program Manager for Word Viewer.

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE><h3>System Requirements for Using Word Viewer</h3>
 

<UL><LI>A personal computer with a 386DX or higher processor
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 operating system or Microsoft
   Windows NT(TM) Workstation operating system 3.51 or later
<LI>4 MB of memory for Windows 95 (6 MB recommended)

<P>
</UL><h3>Installing Microsoft Word Viewer</h3>
 
<P>
Word Viewer for Windows 95 is available on the CD-ROM version of Windows
95. (It is not distributed on the Windows 95 floppy disks.) On the CD-ROM,
Word Viewer is located in the Other\Wordview folder.
<P>
Read the Install.txt file, then run Setup.exe to install Word Viewer. Note
that Setup must install Word Viewer into a different folder than the one
where you extracted the files. Setup will propose "Program Files\Wordview"
as the default location on Windows 95 (C:\WordView on Windows NT 3.51).
<P>
If Word Viewer Setup detects Word for Windows (version 6.0 or later) on
your computer, it will prompt you to determine which application should
open Word documents by default. For example, the default program is used to
open files with .doc or .dot file extensions when they are double-clicked
in the Windows 95 shell or Windows 95 Explorer. If you choose Open With
Word, Word for Windows will be used by default to open Word files. If you
choose Open With Viewer, Word Viewer will be used by default to open Word
files.
<P>
NOTE: If you choose Open With Viewer and you later want to restore Word for
Windows as the default program for Word documents, you must run the Word
for Windows (or Office for Windows) Setup program again and choose
Reinstall.
<P>
After Word Viewer is installed, you can delete the folder you ran Setup
from. However, if you plan to distribute Word Viewer, either online or on
floppy disks, you will need the files in the original folder.
