<P><h3>Word 97 for Windows and Word 98 Macintosh Edition</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: The Calendar Wizard is not installed when you do a complete
installation of Office or Word. It is available on the Office or Word
CD-ROM in the \valupak\templates\word folder. Copy the template from the 
CD-
ROM to the template folder on your hard disk.

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Open. Choose the directory where your
    templates are stored--usually C:\Program files\Microsoft
    Office\Templates. In the Files of Type list, select All Files. In
    the File Name list, select the Calendar Wizard and click OK. On the
    File menu, click Save As and type a new name for the wizard. Any
    formatting changes you make will now be stored in your new wizard.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Page Layout.
<P>
    The Calendar Wizard is composed of AutoText entries which
    correspond to the styles listed in the following table. Before you
    insert and modify an AutoText entry, change the page orientation to
    either portrait or landscape to correspond with the entry as
    indicated below.

<P><LI>To modify the page orientation, click Page Setup on the File menu,
    then select the Paper Size tab. Select Portrait or Landscape based
    on one of the following calendar styles:

    Select the AutoText tab. Choose the AutoText entry that corresponds
    to the calendar style you are creating, and then click the Insert
    button.
<P>
    NOTE: The names of the AutoText Entries are listed in the columns
    labeled Portrait and Landscape in step 3.

<P><LI>Each AutoText entry contains both drawing objects and text boxes.
    These drawing objects are visible only in page layout view or print
    preview. (You will see a blank page after you insert the AutoText
    entry if you are working in normal view.)

<P><LI>Toggle the Show/Hide button so that it is enabled, display table
    gridlines (on the Table menu, check Gridlines), and turn on
    Bookmarks (click Options on the Tools menu, select the View tab,
    click to select the Bookmarks check box, and then click OK).
<P>
    NOTE: Do not delete any of the bookmarks. If these are deleted, the
    wizard may not function properly.

<P><LI>Highlight the text or table cell in which you want to make changes
    (be sure the end-of-cell marker or paragraph mark is also
    selected). Make your formatting changes, such as changing the font or
    point size, adding bold or italics, and so forth. When finished,
    cancel the selection by clicking in the margin of the document.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click AutoText.
    Select the AutoText tab. Select the AutoText entry that you
    previously selected in step 4. Click Delete to delete
    the old AutoText entry. Click Close to return to the document.

<P><LI>Click the Drawing button on the Standard Toolbar to open the
    Drawing Toolbar.

<P><LI>Click the Select Drawing Objects button on the Drawing Toolbar.
    Starting in the upper left corner of the template, click and drag
    down and to the right bottom corner to enclose the entire document
    area. A dashed line appears as you are dragging to enclose the
    objects.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, point to AutoText and then click AutoText. Select
    the AutoText tab. In the Enter AutoText Entries here box, type the
    AutoText name using the same name as the AutoText entry you deleted
    in step 8 and click OK. In the "Look In" list, select the template
    you saved in step 1. Click Add and then click OK.

<P><LI>With the document still selected, click Cut on the Edit menu. You
    should now have a blank page with a single paragraph mark at the
    top left of the page. If you have any text or more than a single
    paragraph mark, delete these items. Click Save on the File menu,
    and then close the template.
