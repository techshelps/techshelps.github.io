<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes what a master document is, the advantages of a
master document, how to create one, how to work with master documents and
their sub-documents, and how to print a master document.
<P>
NOTE: Most of the information in this article is contained at various
places within Microsoft Word Help; however that information has been
compiled in this article for an easy reference tool.
<P>
<P><h2>OVERVIEW OF THE MASTER DOCUMENT FEATURE</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>What Is a Master Document?</h3>
 
<P>
A master document is a container for pointers to individual documents
called subdocuments. Within the master document, the subdocuments appear to
be one long document; but in reality, they are individual documents.
<P>
A master document helps you to organize and to maintain the multiple
subdocuments as a long document. With a master document, you can work
either with the entire long document or with any individual subdocument.
Any Word Document can be a master document or a subdocument.
<P>
You can work individually in a master document (a long document) that you
create yourself, or you can work with others within a workgroup to create
and to revise subdocuments of the master document at the same time.
<P>
<P><h3>Advantages of Using Master Documents</h3>
 
<P>
Working with a master document instead of individual Word document makes it
easier to:

<UL><LI>Move quickly to a location within multiple documents.

<LI>Reorganize multiple documents simply by moving headings.

<LI>See the latest changes to multiple documents without having to open a
   series of individual files.

<LI>Create different arrangements of subdocuments; for example, sorted by
   author or by chapter.

<LI>Create cross-references among multiple documents.

<LI>Compile indexes, tables of contents, and similar lists for multiple
  documents.

<LI>Print multiple documents without having to open a series of individual
   files.

<LI>Do all of the editing in subdocuments, outside of the master document,
   so that the entire master document does not have to be open, thus saving
   resources. Plus, this allows multiple users to work on different
   portions of the master document at the same time.
<P>
</UL>A master document handles the organizational details for you. You don't
have to assemble files or keep track of the file name or location of each
subdocument to create a long document. For example, in a workgroup, one
person can set up a master document and subdocuments on a server.
Individuals who work on the project need to know only where the master
document is stored; they can open and work on any subdocument (individual
document) by opening the master document.
<P>
<P><h2>CREATING A MASTER DOCUMENT</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Up a Master Document</h3>
 
<P>
You can set up a master document by doing any of the following:

<UL><LI>Creating a new master document "from scratch" when you begin a long
   document.

<LI>Converting an existing document into a master document.

<LI>Combining existing documents to create a new master document.
<P>
</UL>Regardless of which method you use to create master document, you work in
master document view, which is a special type of outline view, to create,
add, and arrange subdocuments. The Outlining and Master Document toolbars
appear in master document view so that you can create, promote, and demote
headings; expand and collapse body text; and work with subdocuments.
<P>
The total size of a master document and its subdocuments cannot exceed 32
megabytes (MB).
<P>
In Microsoft Windows 3.x using Word 6.x, the number of subdocuments in a
master document is limited by available file handles. The number of file
handles will vary based on the amount of contiguous memory that is
available. For example, the number of available file handles will be
affected by how much physical RAM you have installed on your system, the
number and behavior of other applications in memory, and how much memory
you have allocated to Word. When the system can no longer expand into
memory, it can no longer create file handles.
<P>
On the Macintosh, system memory starts at the lower addresses and fills
upward. Well-behaved applications start at the highest addresses and fill
downward. As long as there is free memory at the lower address space
between these two areas, the system can expand into this area. When it can
no longer expand into this area, either because it bumps into another
application's memory or because another application loads into memory
immediately above the system memory, the system will not be able to create
file handles.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q131843.htm">Q131843</A></B>
   TITLE    : WD6X: "Too Many Subdocuments Open" in a MacWord Master
              Document

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q113908.htm">Q113908</A></B>
   TITLE    : Troubleshooting Guide: Master Document Error Messages

</PRE>In Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT, the maximum number of subdocuments
allowed in a master document depends on the number of files you have open,
the size of the files you have open, the number of programs you are
running, the amount of computer memory, the operating system you are using,
and other system configurations. If you reach this limit when you save the
master document, Word can't save your documents. To work around this
problem, you can do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Cancel saving the master document, close other programs, and then try
   saving again.

<LI>Convert some of the subdocuments into master document text, and then
   save the master document. For more information, see "To convert a
   subdocument into part of the master document" later in this article.

<LI>Remove the subdocuments from the master document, and then save the
   master document. For more information, see "To remove a subdocument and
   its contents from a master document" later in this article. You can then
   print the subdocuments individually or copy the text from the
   subdocuments into a regular Word document. You can also use an
   INCLUDETEXT field to insert the contents of one subdocument into
   another. Or you can use the Office Binder to combine and organize
   related subdocuments.
<P>
</UL><h3>About Subdocuments and Heading Styles</h3>
 
<P>
Word looks for the built-in heading styles (Heading 1 through Heading 9)
when it creates subdocuments. As you set up a master document, make sure
you use these built-in styles to create headings. If you use the Promote
and Demote buttons on the Outlining toolbar, Word automatically applies the
built-in heading styles.
<P>
You can also use the Style box on the formatting toolbar to apply a built-
in heading style to the paragraph.
<P>
As you organize the headings, decide which heading level will mark the
beginning of each subdocument. For example, you might want to use a
Heading 1 for the title of the entire document and keep that text as part
of the master document instead of including it in any of the subdocuments.
You could then use a Heading 2 wherever you want to start a new
subdocument.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Master Document from Scratch</h3>
 
<P>
To create a master document from scratch, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open a new document.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Master Document.
<P>
   NOTE: The Outlining and Master Document toolbars appear.

<P><LI>Type an outline for the master document, using the buttons on the
   Outlining toolbar to create, promote, and demote headings. Pick a
   heading level to mark the beginning of each subdocument.
<P>
   For example:
<P>
   Type the following information into a new document in Master Document
   view.
<P>
<PRE>     Type this outline:                Using this style:

   The Solar System                 Set style to Heading 1:
      Mercury                       Set style to Heading 2:
         Geology                    Set style to Heading 3:
         Atmosphere                 Set style to Heading 3:
      Venus                         Set style to Heading 2:
         Geology                    Set style to Heading 3:
         Atmosphere                 Set style to Heading 3:
      Earth                         Set style to Heading 2:
         Geology                    Set style to Heading 3:
         Atmosphere                 Set style to Heading 3:
         Moons                      Set style to Heading 3:

   NOTE: Heading 1 is used for the title of the master document, and
   Heading 2 is used for the beginning of each subdocument as you create it
   in step 3.

</PRE><P><LI>Select the headings you want to divide into subdocuments. You can select
   any or all of the headings. Make sure that the first heading in the
   selection is the heading level you want Word to use for the beginning of
   each subdocument.
<P>
   For our example above, start selecting with the first Heading 2 setting
   (Mercury) and select through Moons. Because the first line selected has
   the style set to Heading 2, a subdocument is created for each line
   selected that is formatted with the Heading 2 style.

<P><LI>Click the Create Subdocument button on the Master Document toolbar. Word
   will create the subdocuments.
<P>
   In our example, 3 subdocuments are formed; one for Mercury, one for
   Venus, and one for Earth because the first selection was a Heading 2 and
   Mercury, Venus, and Earth are formatted with Heading 2 styles.
<P>
   Note what you see on the screen: Word encloses each subdocument in a box
   (called the subdocument box) and displays a subdocument icon in the
   upper-left corner of each box. Word also separates subdocuments with a
   section break above the top and bottom parts of the subdocument box. In
   order to see the section break identifiers, you must have the Show/Hide
   turned on. (Click the Show/Hide button or click Options on the Tools
   menu, select the View tab, click to select All under Non-printing
   characters). It is recommended that this setting is always turned on
   when working in the Master Document View. To determine the type of
   section break that was inserted, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Move the insertion point below the top section break of the
<P><PRE>      subdocument.
</PRE><P>
   b. On the File menu, click Page Setup and then click the Layout tab.
<P>
   c. The type of section break is listed under Section Start.
<P>
   d. Click Cancel.

<P><LI>Click Save As on the File menu. Enter a name in the (Word for Windows)
   File Name box or (Word for Macintosh) "Save Current Document as" box and
   then click (Word 6.x for Macintosh, Word 7.x and 97 for Windows) Save
   or (Word 6.x for Windows) OK. Word will save the master document and all
   of its subdocuments in the location you specify and will automatically
   assign file names to the subdocuments.
<P>
   NOTES:
<P>
   - To see the file name that Word assigned to a subdocument, double-click
<P><PRE>     the subdocument icon to open the subdocument. You will see the name of
     the subdocument in the title bar. (To close the subdocument, click
     Close on the File menu to return to the master document.). In Word 97,
     you can press the Collapse Subdocument button on the Master Document
     toolbar.
</PRE><P>
   - When you save a master document, the subdocuments are separate
<P><PRE>     individual documents as well as the master document. In our example,
     we have 4 files saved (1 for the master document and 3 for the
     subdocuments).
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Creating a Master Document by Inserting Existing Word Documents</h3>
 
<P>
To create a master document by inserting existing Word documents, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In master document view, open the master document to which you want to
   add an existing Word document as a subdocument.

<P><LI>Position the insertion point where you want to add the existing document
   as a subdocument.
<P>
   NOTE: Make sure that Show/Hide is turned on and that your insertion
   point is not contained within a subdocument.

<P><LI>On the Master Document toolbar, click the Insert Subdocument button.

<P><LI>In the File Name box (Word for Windows) or the Select a Document box
   (Word for Macintosh), type or select the name of the document you want
   to add, and then click Open (Word 7.x and 97 for Windows) or OK (Windows
   and Macintosh Word 6.x).
<P>
   Word adds the document and keeps its original file name.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If the new document and the master document are based on different
templates, or if they have different settings, Word uses the formatting
from the template attached to the master document when you work with the
subdocument from within the master document. However, if you open the
subdocument from either within or outside the master document, Word uses
the formatting of the template attached to the subdocument. (See more
information under "Using Templates with Master Documents" later in this
article.)
<P>
<P><h2>WORKING WITH A MASTER DOCUMENT</h2>
 
<P>
You can work with a master document either in Master Document view or in
Normal view. To work most effectively, follow these guidelines:

<UL><LI>Switch to Master Document view to see or revise the structure of a long
   document or to open specific subdocuments. In Master Document view, you
   see an outline of the current document and can easily open any
   subdocument.

<LI>Switch to Normal view to work on the master document as a whole. With
   the master document open in Normal view, you can create cross-references
   among multiple subdocuments and make other changes easily, just as if
   you had opened a single long document. When you work in Normal view,
   each subdocument will be contained within section breaks of the master
   document. This view allows more control to determine which section break
   you are in and what properties the section contains.

<LI>In Word 97, when you first open a master document, all subdocuments will
   be collapsed; that is, each subdocument will appear as a hyperlink
   showing only the path and file name of the subdocuments. You can click a
   hyperlink to open the subdocument and work on it in its own window. If
   you prefer to work on the master document as a whole, you can expand the
   subdocuments by clicking the Expand Subdocument button on the Master
   Document toolbar and work on them in place or switch to normal view.
   This is different behavior as compared to previous versions of Word.
<P>
</UL>After you set up a master document, it is important that when you make
changes that affect the overall project, you do so from within the master
document. For example, if you need to add or remove a subdocument from a
master document, make sure that you open the appropriate master document
and then make the changes from within the master document. Do not use
Windows File Manager, Windows Explorer, or the Macintosh Finder to delete
files that are part of a master document unless you first remove the
subdocument from the master document.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKING WITH SUBDOCUMENTS</h2>
 
<P>
Working with a subdocument is much like working on a normal Word document,
with the following important distinctions:

<UL><LI>Word uses the Author field of each document's summary information to
   determine who "owns" the document. If you open a master document or
   subdocument that you didn't create, you must unlock it before you can
   make changes. For more information about master document locking, see
   "Sharing a Master Document with Others," later in this article.

<LI>To move text or graphics among subdocuments, open the master document
   that contains the subdocuments and then switch to Normal view. Then
   either drag or cut and paste the text and graphics you want to move,
   just as if you were working on a single document. You can also work in
   Master Document view if you want to move the entire contents of a
   subdocument into another subdocument. In Master Document view, you can
   move headings and their subordinate text just as you do in Outline view.
   These methods are often easier than opening several subdocuments and
   then cutting and pasting text and graphics among them.

<LI>If you want multiple authors to work on parts of a subdocument
   simultaneously, you can split the subdocument. Conversely, you can merge
   subdocuments if you want to combine small files. You can also "nest"
   subdocuments. To do this, just select the headings in a subdocument and
   then click the Create Subdocument button to create a new subdocument.
   You can create up to 9 layers of master documents and subdocuments.
<P>
</UL>IMPORTANT: In the following procedures, the subdocument you want to work
with may be locked. Word will display a padlock symbol in the upper-left
corner of a locked subdocument. To unlock it, position the insertion point
in the subdocument and click the Lock Document button on the Master
Document toolbar.
<P>
To open a subdocument from within a master document, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the master document, and click Master Document on the View
   menu.

<P><LI>To open the subdocument, double-click the subdocument icon.
<P>
   NOTE: If other users need to work on the master document, close the
   master document so that they can access it.

<P><LI>Edit the subdocument.

<P><LI>When you finish making changes, save the subdocument.
<P>
</OL>When you save the subdocument, Word automatically updates the changes in
the subdocument and its master documents.
<P>
To change the type of section break, follow these steps:
<P>
At times, you may need to change the type of section break, for example,
from a Continuous to a New Page or Odd Page section break. This occurs most
frequently at the beginning of a new chapter of a book. Do the following to
change the type of section break.

<OL><P><LI>Open the Master Document and click Normal on the View menu.

<P><LI>Move the insertion point to the first page of the subdocument (chapter)
   that you want to change the type of section break.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Page Setup, and then click the Layout tab.

<P><LI>Under Section Break, click the drop-down list and select the type of
   Section Start that you want to use.

<P><LI>Beside Apply To, select This Section.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>MAKING CHANGES TO THE MASTER DOCUMENT AND SUBDOCUMENTS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Renaming or Changing the Location of a Subdocument</h3>
 
<P>
If you rename a subdocument or move it to a different disk, directory, or
folder, make sure that you first open the subdocument from within its
master document. Then, use the Save As command on the File menu to rename
the subdocument or to save it in a new location. Do not close the master
document until you have saved the subdocument you renamed or moved. Do the
following to correctly rename or change the location of a subdocument.
<P>
To rename or change the location of a subdocument, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the master document, and click Master Document on the View
   menu.

<P><LI>To open the subdocument, double-click the subdocument icon.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As.

<P><LI>Type a new file name or location for the subdocument, and then click
   Save (Word 6.x for Macintosh, Word 7.x and 97 for Windows) or OK (Word
   6.x for Windows).

<P><LI>Click Close on the File menu to return to the master document.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you no longer need the previous version of a subdocument, you may
want to delete it.
<P>
To move a master document and its subdocuments, please see the following

   TITLE     : WD: Error Message: "Subdocument Is Missing..."

</PRE></OL><h3>Rearranging Subdocuments Within a Master Document</h3>
 
<P>
To rearrange subdocuments within a master document, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In master document view, do one of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>       - To select an entire subdocument, click the subdocument icon.
      
       - To move certain headings within or among subdocuments, select only
<PRE></PRE>         the headings you want to move.

</PRE><P><LI>Drag the subdocument icon or Heading level symbol to the new location.
<P>
</OL>NOTES:

<UL><LI>Dragging text in this procedure will remove the text from the
   subdocument or possibly change the heading-level format; therefore,
   make sure you drag the subdocument icon or Heading level symbol.

<LI>This may cause some problems with section breaks as the initial top
   section break to the subdocument will not be moved.

<LI>An alternative to this method would be to delete the subdocument and
   then re-insert it where you want.
<P>
</UL>To split a subdocument into two subdocuments, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Master Document view, select the heading or other location where you
   want to split the subdocument.

<P><LI>On the Master Document toolbar, click the Split Subdocument button.

<P><LI>To save the changes in both the master document and the subdocuments,
   click Save on the File menu.
<P>
</OL>For additional information, please see the following article in the

   TITLE     : WD: Using the Split Subdocument Icon May Create Empty
                   Documents

</PRE></OL>To merge subdocuments, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>To merge subdocuments, they first need to be consecutive; therefore, in
   Master Document view, move the subdocuments next to one another in the
   master document.

<P><LI>Click the subdocument icon to select the first subdocument that you want
   to merge.

<P><LI>To select the next subdocument, hold down SHIFT and click its
   subdocument icon.

<P><LI>Repeat step 3 for each subdocument that you want to merge.

<P><LI>On the Master Document toolbar, click the Merge Subdocument button.
<P>
</OL>Notes:

<UL><LI>When you save the master document, Word saves the merged subdocuments
   with the file name of the first subdocument.

<LI>If you no longer need the previous version of a subdocument, you may
   want to delete it.

<LI>All section breaks will be retained.
<P>
</UL>To convert a subdocument into part of the master document, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>In master document view, click the subdocument icon to select the
   subdocument that you want to convert into the master document.

<P><LI>On the Master Document toolbar, click the Remove Subdocument button.
<P>
</OL>Word will convert the subdocument into part of the master document
retaining all associated section breaks.
<P>
<P><h3>Removing a Subdocument and Its Contents from a Master Document</h3>
 
<P>
To remove the contents of a subdocument from a master document, switch to
master document view, and then remove the subdocument. Do not just delete a
subdocument from the disk; if you do this, you'll get an error message the
next time you open the master document. If you want to delete a
subdocument, first remove it from its master document, and then delete it
from the disk by doing the following.
<P>
To remove a subdocument and its contents from a master document, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Master Document view, click the subdocument icon to select the
   subdocument that you want to remove.

<P><LI>Press BACKSPACE or DELETE.
<P>
</OL>Word removes the subdocument form a master document retaining all
associated section breaks.
<P>
NOTE: When you remove the subdocument from the master document, the
subdocument still exists on the drive and in the directory where it was
stored.
<P>
<P><h2>SHARING A MASTER DOCUMENT WITH OTHER USERS</h2>
 
<P>
Word provides a special type of file locking to make it easier for several
people to work simultaneously on a master document and its subdocuments.
<P>
When you open a master document, Word opens the subdocuments that "belong"
to you as read-write files, which you can both view and edit. Word opens
the subdocuments you didn't create as read-only files. You can view these
locked subdocuments, but you can't make changes to them until you unlock
them. Word determines whether you are the author of a subdocument by
checking the Author field in the subdocument's summary information against
the name you supplied when you installed Word.
<P>
Of course, if another user has opened a master document or subdocument and
is making changes to it, the normal network file-protection system also
applies. You cannot open and make changes to a file that another user is
working on.
<P>
The special file-locking feature for master documents and subdocuments is
not designed to protect documents from changes. It's simply a way to give
users easy access to the subdocuments they created and are therefore most
likely to work on. Anyone can unlock any subdocument by using the Lock
Document button on the Master Document toolbar.
<P>

   TITLE     : Word Opens Master Document as Read-Only

</PRE></OL><h3>Reserving Read-Write Privileges</h3>
 
<P>
When another user opens a master document or subdocument, even as read-only
file, normally you cannot open that document as a read-write file. However,
you can reserve read-write privileges by setting options on the Save tab of
the Options dialog box.
<P>
To reserve read-write privileges for a master document or a subdocument,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the document for which you want to reserve read-write privileges.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As, and then click the Options button.

<P><LI>On the Save tab, do one of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>       - Type a password in the (Word 97) Password to Modify Box or
<PRE></PRE>         (Windows and Macintosh Word 6.x, Windows Word 7.x) Write
         Reservation Password box.
      
         -or-
      
       - Select the Read-Only Recommended check box.

</PRE><P><LI>Click OK and in the Save As dialog box, click Save (Word 6.x for
   Macintosh, and Word 7.x or 97 for Windows) or OK (Word 6.x for Windows).
<P>
</OL>When you select either of these options, other users can open the document
as a read-only file, but you can still open the document as a read-write
file. Other users can open a copy of the document as a read-write file if
they know the password or if they choose the No button when they open the
document. They will not be able to change the original document.

<OL><P><LI>Open the master document.

<P><LI>In Master Document view, place the insertion point into the subdocument
   you want to lock or unlock.

<P><LI>On the Master Document toolbar, click the Lock Document button.

</PRE></OL><h2>FORMATTING A MASTER DOCUMENT</h2>
 
<P>
You can format a master document just as you would any other Word document.
You can also create a template for a master document, define styles for it,
and apply formatting to any part of the master document or its
subdocuments.
<P>
Because each subdocument is a section of the master document, you can
change such section formatting as headers, page numbers, margins, and
column layout at the beginning of each subdocument. You can also insert
additional section breaks within a subdocument to control formatting within
that subdocument.
<P>
When formatting a master document, keep the following basic rules in mind:

<UL><LI>Apply formats or choose settings for the entire document in the master
   document, not in a subdocument.

<LI>Apply formats or choose settings for an individual subdocument in that
   subdocument only.
<P>
</UL>For example, you can set the header with a document title and page number
in the master document. If you don't set headers for any of the
subdocument, the master document's header appears on every page. If you
want a different header for each subdocument, set up the headers in the
individual subdocuments.
<P>
If you insert documents and make them part of a master document, each
document retains its original section formatting. You may have to change
the section formatting in the subdocuments if you want them to share the
same headers, footers, page number format, and so on.
<P>

   TITLE    :  How INCLUDE Fields Affect Headers/Footers in Master
               Documents

</PRE><h3>Using Templates with Master Documents</h3>
 
<P>
When you work with subdocuments from within a master document, the style
definitions in the master document's template override the style
definitions in a subdocument's template. However, the column layout,
margins, special page number settings, and other section formatting in each
subdocument remain in effect.
<P>
On the other hand, if you open a subdocument outside of a master document,
the subdocument's original formatting and settings apply. The association
between the subdocument and its template isn't broken.
<P>

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Template and User Styles not Saved in Subdocument

</PRE><h3>Tables of Contents, Cross-references, and Indexes</h3>
 
<P>
Using a master document to create a long document simplifies the creation
of cross-references, indexes, tables of contents, tables of figures, tables
of authorities, and other lists.
<P>
You can make a table of contents and index part of the master document, or
you can make them into subdocuments. It's important, however, to update a
table of contents, an index, or cross-references from within the master
document. If you update any of these items outside of the master document,
they will not reflect the entire master document, and you will see error
messages in the subdocuments instead of the appropriate numbers of cross-
references.
<P>

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : WD: Errors in Cross-References in Master Document or
                   Subdocument

</PRE><h3>Creating a Table on Contents</h3>
 
<P>
You can create a table of contents for a long document by opening the
master document and switching to master document view. Position the
insertion point where you want to insert the table of contents, and then
use the Index And Tables command on the Insert menu to compile the table of
contents. To update a table of contents, open the master document, switch
to normal view, position the insertion point anywhere in the table of
contents, and then press F9.

   TITLE     : WD: How to build a Table of Contents Using Custom Styles

</PRE><h3>Creating Cross-references</h3>
 
<P>
Using a master document is the only way to create cross-references that
point to items in different documents. Just open a master document in
normal view, and then use the procedures for creating cross-references as
if you were working on a single large document. In effect, when you use a
master document, you can ignore the "boundaries" between subdocuments.
<P>
Keep in mind, however, that when you open the individual subdocuments, you
cannot create or update cross-references to other subdocuments; you must
work on the master document to do this.
<P>

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : WD: General Information About Cross-Reference Fields

</PRE><h3>Creating an Index</h3>
 
<P>
Creating an index for a master document is easier than compiling an index
for a series of Word documents. Just add index entries in the usual way as
you work on subdocuments.
<P>
When you are ready to compile the index, open the master document, and then
position the insertion point where you want to include the index. To update
the index, open the master document, position the insertion point anywhere
in the index, and then press F9.

</PRE><h2>PRINTING A MASTER DOCUMENT</h2>
 
<P>
You can print master documents in two ways. To print the entire master
document, print it from Normal view. If you want to print only the outline
of a master document, print the master document from Master Document view.
For example, you can choose to print only the top two heading levels.
<P>
If you want to print the contents of a particular subdocument, you can open
that subdocument and then print it in the normal way. If the subdocument
contains cross-references to other subdocuments, however, you must print
the master document--not the individual subdocument--so that the cross-
references are updated properly.
<P>
To print a master document, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Do one of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>       - To control the amount of detail you want printed, display the
<PRE></PRE>         master document in Master Document view. Expand or collapse
         headings to display as much of the document as you want to print.
      
         -or-
      
       - To print the entire document, display the master document in
         Normal view.
