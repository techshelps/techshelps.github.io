The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
   on the following platform: Windows NT
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word 97 may appear to stop responding when you open either the
File Print dialog box or the File Page Setup dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are running Word 97 on a computer running Windows NT Workstation.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The default printer is using a printer driver on a print server computer
   running Windows NT Server.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The network connection to the print server is lost.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Word 97 is trying to access the printer driver on the print server. Windows
NT is continuously trying to access the server and takes a long time to
send an error message back to Word.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you wait long enough, Word receives the error message from Windows NT,
and then Word continues to run properly (with the exception of printing).
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, select another printer that does
not use the lost connection as the default printer, until you reestablish
the connection.
<P>
In some cases the printer with the lost connection does not have to be the
default printer to cause a delay when opening the File Print dialog. In
this case, you need to delete the printer, modify, or reestablish the
connection.
<P>
<P><h3>To Delete a Printer</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

<P><LI>Right-click the icon of the printer that you want to delete.

<P><LI>Click Delete on the shortcut menu, and click Yes when you are asked if
   you want to delete the printer.
<P>
</OL><h3>To Modify a Printer Connection</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

<P><LI>Right-click the icon of the printer whose connection you want to modify.

<P><LI>Click Properties on the shortcut menu, and then click the Details tab.

<P><LI>In the "Print to the following port" list, click to select a
   valid printer path.

<P><LI>Click OK
<P>
</OL><h3>To Install a New Printer</h3>

<P><LI>Double-click the Add Printer icon, and then click Next.

<P><LI>Click Local Printer or Network Printer as appropriate, and then click
   Next.
<P>
   NOTE: If you click Network Printer, you are prompted for the network
   path for the printer. If you do not know the correct path, click Browse,
   or check with your network administrator.

<P><LI>Click either Yes or No in the "Do you print from MS-DOS-based programs?"
   area, and then click Next.

<P><LI>Click the appropriate manufacturer and model for your printer, and
   then click Next.

<P><LI>If you chose to install a local printer, click the correct port and
   then click Next.

<P><LI>Type a name for the printer (or accept the default name), and then
   click either Yes or No in the "Do you want your Windows-based programs
   to use this printer as the default printer?" area. Click Next.
