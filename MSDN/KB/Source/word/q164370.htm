The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists several development resources that are available for
download from the Microsoft Office Developer Web site.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following files are available in the Microsoft Office Developer Web
site.
<P>
<P><h3>WordPerfect 5.1 Macro Text Extractor</h3>
 
<P>
Executable file contains: cvt_doc.doc, wp51cvt.dot
<P>
WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS uses a proprietary file format for storing
macros. This macro-to-text utility converts macros written for
WordPerfect 5.1 to standard text for viewing and printing.
<P>
NOTE: The utility does not translate WordPerfect macro code to Visual
Basic for Applications.
<P>

</PRE><h3>WordBasic Migration to Visual Basic for Applications</h3>
 
<P>
Executable file contains: Wbmigrat.doc
<P>
Microsoft has integrated WordBasic migration to Visual Basic as
transparently as possible. When a template file is opened, either
directly or indirectly (attached templates are an example of indirect)
the WordBasic code is converted to Visual Basic automatically. In most
cases the user doesn't even know that a conversion process happened.
This paper explains the conversion process, many of the known
conversion issues, and solutions to resolve conversion issues.
<P>

</PRE><h3>Updated WbODBC.wll</h3>
 
<P>
Executable file contains: Wbodbc97.dot, Wbodbc.wll, Test.mdb,
Readme.txt
<P>
If you've written Word 7.0 solutions that use the ODBC functions in
WbODBC.wll (a Word add-in library available in the Microsoft Word
Developer's Kit, 3rd edition), you'll need to install this updated
version of the WLL to run your solution in Word 97. In addition to a
new version of the WLL, this download also includes new versions of the
sample ODBC macros template (WbODBC97.dot) and the corresponding test
database (Test.mdb). The macros in WbODBC97.dot have been updated to
use Visual Basic and demonstrate how to use the ODBC add-in functions
successfully in Word 97. For complete information about this update,
see the Readme.txt file included in this download.

</PRE><h3>Converting WordPerfect Macros to Microsoft Word 97 Visual Basic</h3>
 
<P>
White Paper: Converting WordPerfect Macros to Microsoft Word 97, Visual
Basic for Applications
<P>
Executable file contains: wpconv.doc
<P>
This document describes the methodology, approach, and requirements for
converting macros developed for various versions of WordPerfect to
Visual Basic for Applications in Microsoft Word. Because of the
complexity of macros, there's no automatic conversion utility available
for converting macros from WordPerfect to Visual Basic for
Applications. However, an unsupported macro-to-text utility is
available that converts macros written for WordPerfect 5.1 to standard
text for viewing and printing.
<P>

</PRE><h3>Updating String Functions in WLLs and DLLs for Word 97</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word add-in libraries (WLLs) and dynamic-link libraries (DLLs)
that expose string-returning or string-processing functions that worked in
earlier versions of Word (6.0 or 95) may not work correctly when used in
Word 97.
<P>
The following outline describes the string-related problems you may
encounter, along with the three steps necessary to make string functions
from old WLLs and DLLs work with Visual Basic for Applications in Word 97.
(Step 4 is necessary only if you want to keep using old WordBasic code in a
template after converting it to Word 97.) Note that after you make the
suggested changes in your source code, your modified WLL or DLL can still
work in Word 95. However, it will not work in 16-bit environments.
<P>
For more information about updating string functions in WLLs and DLLs for
Word 97, see the following Microsoft Office Developer Web site:
