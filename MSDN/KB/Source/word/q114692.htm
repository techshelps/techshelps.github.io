<PRE> 

</PRE> 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD,2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL>

WARNING: ANY USE BY YOU OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IS AT
YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this information "as is" without warranty
of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose.
<P>
Using Word version 2.x and 6.x on the same machine is not supported by
Microsoft Product Support Services. The steps described in this article
have been tested for practical use of the two programs together but are not
guaranteed to meet any specific configuration needs. Using Word in this
configuration may cause problems with OLE applications and other path
concerns.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can run Word 2.x and 6.0 for Windows on the same computer. This article
provides the steps to accomplish this.
<P>
NOTE: This procedure applies to setting up Word 6.0 with the Microsoft Word
for Windows packaged product, NOT with the Setup program contained in
Microsoft Office.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This procedure assumes that you have Word 2.0 installed but you have not
yet installed Word 6.0. It also assumes that you have Word 2.0 installed in
the C:\WINWORD directory and that you will install Word 6.0 in the
C:\WINWINWORD2 directory. If the drive and/or directory names differ, you
must substitute accordingly throughout the procedure.

<OL><P><LI>Run Word 6.0 Setup.

<P><LI>When Setup suggests that Word 6.0 be installed in C:\WINWORD, change
   this location to C:\WINWORD6, and Setup will create a new directory
   where the Word 6.0 files will be decompressed.

<P><LI>When Setup asks in which program group on the Windows desktop you want
   the Word 6.0 icons (Setup suggests Microsoft Office), specify "Word 6.0"
   (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>After Setup is complete, rename the Word 2.0 WINWORD.EXE file (located
   in C:\WINWORD) to WINWORD2.EXE. (To rename a file, use Windows File
   Manager.)

<P><LI>From Windows Program Manager, highlight the icon for Word 2.0. From the
   File menu, choose Properties, and change the Command Line reference of
   the icon so that it points to C:\WINWORD\WINWORD2.EXE.
<P>
</OL><h3>Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 for Windows ships with OLE version 2.0. During the Word 6.0 Setup,
new versions of WordArt and Equation Editor are installed. These new
versions are available from the Insert Object dialog box in both versions.
<P>
<PRE>  - Both versions 1.0 and 2.0 of WordArt are available in Word 2.0 and 6.0.

</PRE><LI>Only Equation Editor version 2.0 is available, even though there is
   still a choice for versions 1.0 and 2.0 in the Insert Object dialog box.

<LI>Microsoft Graph and Microsoft Draw have not changed and versions 1.0 are
   available in Word 2.0 and 6.0.
