                                          layout. If margins do not convert

                                          these boxes become drawing layer
                                          objects in Word. Graphic lines
                                          become solid lines. Text that is
                                          tight-wrapped around a graphic
                                          becomes square-wrapped

                                          characters are converted. If one
                                          or more of these fonts are not
                                          available, some characters may
