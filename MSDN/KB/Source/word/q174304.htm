The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, Service Release 1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When the Save As command is used to save a Word document with a different
file name, you may receive unexpected behavior.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: If You Are Using a Document Management System (DMS)</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Word 97 for Windows with a document management
system, after you attempt to open a document, you receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;original.doc&gt; is being used by another user.
   Do you want to make a copy?

</PRE>NOTE: &lt;Original.doc&gt; is the name of the file you are trying to open. This
error message will be displayed if, before you attempt to open the file,
another user has opened &lt;original.doc&gt; and has used the Save As command to
save a copy of it. The error message is displayed even if the other user no
longer has &lt;original.doc&gt; open in a window.
<P>
If you are using a DMS system, you may experience data loss in the original
document.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2: If You Are Using GroupWise</h3>
 
<P>
When you click Exit on the File menu with a GroupWise document open, you
may receive the following error message in Word:
<P>
<PRE>   GroupWise error 8201 - cannot return document to library

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because Microsoft Word does not correctly close the
original document when you use the Save As command to save the document
with another file name.
<P>
During the Save As process, Word looks for a drawing object in the
document. If the document lacks a drawing object, the document is not
closed correctly.
<P>
NOTE: Once you quit Microsoft Word or close the newly created document (the
document you created using the Save As command with &lt;original.doc&gt;), the
original document is closed as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Updated Winword.exe and Wwintl32.dll files that resolve this problem are
available from Microsoft Technical Support.
<P>
If you are running Word in a Document Management System (DMS) environment
and require these files, contact Microsoft Technical Support at (425) 462-
9673 and request the files associated with this Knowledge Base article
(<B><A HREF="../WORD/Q179435.htm">Q179435</A></B>).
<P>
The ODMAupd.exe file you will receive contains the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   Winword.exe   5,199 KB, 5.07MB(5,323,536 bytes)   1/14/98
   WWintl32.dll  1,131 KB, 1.01MB(1,157,904 bytes)   1/14/98

</PRE>Although this supported fix is now available, it has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem.
<P>
Note: If you are not running a Document Management System or Groupwise, this
<PRE>      fix will be of no benefit and should not be installed.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word 97 for Windows,
and Word 97 for Windows, Service Release 1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you obtain the self-extracting executable file, extract its contents
and copy the files to the location in which your Office program files are
stored. The default location for Office program files is
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office

</PRE>If you installed Word using the Run From Server option, contact your
network administrator to replace the existing Winword.exe and WWintl32.dll
files on the server with the new ones supplied by ODMAupd.exe.
<P>
Microsoft recommends that you install Office 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1)
before installing the Word ODMA update. For more information about
installing and obtaining Office 97 SR-1, please see the following articles
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q172527.htm">Q172527</A></B>
   TITLE     : WD97: How to Obtain Word 97 for Windows Service Release 1

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../OFFICE/Q172475.htm">Q172475</A></B>
   TITLE     : OFF97: How to Obtain and Install the MS Office 97 SR-1 Patch

</PRE><h3>Removing the Saveas.dot Macros</h3>
 
<P>
If you previously installed a macro to workaround the problem or if you
installed the Saveas.dot template provided by Microsoft Technical Support,
you may want to remove the macros.
<P>
NOTE: If your version of Word was installed with the Run From Network
Server option, contact your network administrator to complete these steps.
<P>
To remove the macros, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Normal.dot file.
<P>
   By default, this file located in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft
   Office\Templates folder.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and click Macros.

<P><LI>Select the Document_open macro, and then click Delete.

<P><LI>Close Word. If prompted, save the changes to Normal.dot. If you are
   unable to save the changes to Normal.dot, contact your network
   administrator.
