<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
TIP: The standard menus that are predefined (built-in) for Word have been
specifically created to contain the majority of the functions performed by
users. They should not be modified heavily, but rather be supplemented by
menus designed by the users for their particular work style. Hiding the
original menus and displaying customized menus is best controlled by
creating templates, a subject which is discussed elsewhere.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Menu</h3>
 
<P>
To create a menu, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition by double-clicking the
   Microsoft Word icon in the Microsoft Office 98 folder.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Customize.

<P><LI>Click the Toolbars tab.

<P><LI>Click to select Menu Bar in the Toolbars list.
<P>
   This displays a customizable copy of the menu bar.
<P>
   NOTE: This must be done each time the Customize dialog box is opened.
   The customizable copy of the menu bar is turned off each time
   the Customize dialog box is closed.

<P><LI>Click the Commands tab. Then, under Categories, click New Menu.

<P><LI>Under Commands, click New Menu, and drag it to the location on the menu
   bar or toolbar where you want it to appear.
<P>
   The Customize dialog box and the menu bar should both be visible. It
   may be necessary to move the Customize dialog box if it is covering the
   menu bar.
<P>
</OL><h3>Changing the Name of the New Menu</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: The Customize dialog box must remain open at all times while you
modify menus.

<OL><P><LI>While pressing and holding down the CONTROL key, click the new menu.

<P><LI>In the Name box, type the new name, replacing any other text. When you
   are finished, click Return.
<P>
</OL><h3>Adding Commands to a Menu</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the Customize dialog box, click the Commands tab.

<P><LI>Under Categories, click File, and then under Commands, drag New to the
   new menu. When the mouse pointer is over the menu, it will open (drop
   down). Position the mouse pointer over the menu drop down. There will be
   an indication of where the command will display when you drop it.
   When positioned where you want it, drop the command on the menu drop
   down. After dropping the command, you can drag the commands around the
   menu to re-arrange them.
<P>
   Repeat this process, dragging several Commands from various Categories
   to the new menu.
<P>
</OL><h3>Removing a Command from a Menu</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: It is possible to remove or configure menus in such a way that you
cannot get back to the commands you need to change them again. Renaming the
Normal template (usually located in a folder named Templates in the
Microsoft Office 98 folder on your hard disk) while Word is not running
will cause a new Normal template to be created the next time Word is
started. This new Normal will have all the default (original) menus. The
Organizer can then be used to transfer items such as macros, styles, or
toolbars from the old Normal to the new one.
<P>
Open the menu and click and drag the item you want to remove from the menu
to the document area of Word and drop it there.
<P>
NOTE: The Customize dialog box must be open while you modify menus. Close
the Customize dialog box only when you are finished.
<P>
<P><h3>Positioning a Menu</h3>
 
<P>
Although menus are typically placed on a special toolbar called the menu
bar, whenever the customize dialog box is open, you can drag menus to any
toolbar and to any legal position on that toolbar.
<P>
WARNING: If the menu is NOT in a legal position (the mouse pointer has an X
beside it) when dropped, the menu will be deleted. There is no undo command
for these actions.
<P>
<P><h3>Deleting or Resetting a Menu</h3>
 
<P>
While the Customize dialog is open and the Menu Bar is visible, press
and hold down the CONTROL key and click the menu you want. Click Delete or
Reset in the new dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about menus, click the Office Assistant, type "Menu"
in the query area of the Office Assistant and click Search.
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Word Help is not installed on your computer, please
