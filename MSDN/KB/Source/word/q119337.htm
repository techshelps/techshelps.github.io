<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm</A></B>

</PRE><h2>NEW FEATURES FOR WORD FOR THE MACINTOSH</h2>
 
<P>
This section introduces new features that are unique to Word for the
Macintosh and those features that were formerly available only in Word
for Windows(TM), including the WordBasic macro programming language.
<P>
<P><h3>WordBasic macros and AppleEvents scripts</h3>
 
<P>
With the Macro command on the Tools menu, you can write a WordBasic
macro or record a series of actions and keystrokes. Word records the
actions as a WordBasic macro, which you can then edit.
<P>
You can run most macros that were created in Word for Windows in Word
for the Macintosh. Macros that work on the contents of a document and
use features that are common to both Windows and Macintosh versions of
Word 6.0 require little, if any, editing. Macros that involve system-
level operations, such as launching other applications, will need to
be edited.
<P>
Word for the Macintosh supports AppleEvents and AppleScript(TM). You can
use WordBasic to record actions in Word, and then run the WordBasic
macro from AppleScript. A script in AppleScript can also run any built-
in WordBasic statement or function.
<P>
For more information about WordBasic and AppleScript, see the
"Microsoft Word Developer's Kit," published by Microsoft Press(R).
<P>
<P><h3>Word fields insert information automatically</h3>
 
<P>
In previous versions of Word for the Macintosh, you inserted such
information as the date, time, author, and filename by inserting a
standard glossary entry. Now you can insert these and many other types
of information -- and keep the information current--by using a Word
field. You can insert commonly used fields for the date, time, and
page numbers simply by choosing the Date And Time and Page Numbers
commands on the Insert menu. To insert other types of information, use
the Field command on the Insert menu.
<P>
For more information about Word fields, see Chapter 32, "Inserting
Information with Fields," in the "Microsoft Word User's Guide."
<P>
<P><h3>Word provides templates for documents</h3>
 
<P>
Like Macintosh stationery, a Word template is a "master blueprint" for
a new document. Just choose the New command from the File menu, and
then select the template you want. Word copies any boilerplate text,
styles, margin settings, and other formatting from the template to a
new, untitled document.
<P>
Other items you can store in a template include AutoText entries,
macros, toolbars, and other command settings that you want to use with
a particular type of document. You can use these stored items in any
document that you base on that template. For example, if you create a
group of macros for use with sales reports and assign the macros to a
toolbar, you can store the macros and customized toolbar in the report
template.
<P>
Word provides many ready-to-use templates for creating documents, such
as business letters, reports, and memos. If you performed a complete
installation of Word, all templates and wizards are installed. If you
performed a typical installation, templates and wizards for letters,
memos, and fax cover sheets are installed. To install the remaining
templates and wizards, run Word Setup again and select the Templates
And Wizards check box under Wizards, Templates, and Letters.
<P>
For a description of these templates, see Chapter 5, "Wizards,
Templates, and Business Letters." For information on using your
existing stationery with Word, see Chapter 10, "Document Templates,"
in the "Microsoft Word User's Guide."
<P>
<P><h2>WIZARDS AND "AUTO" FEATURES SIMPLIFY COMMON TASKS</h2>
 
<P>
Word now includes the following features to automate and simplify the
creation, formatting, and production of documents:
<P>
<P><h3>Wizards, templates, and prewritten business letters get you started</h3>
 
<P>
Using a wizard is often the fastest way to create a letter, memo,
resume, newsletter, or other common type of document. Choose the New
command from the File menu, and then select a wizard for the type of
document that you want to create. After you answer a few questions,
Word sets up the basic formatting and layout. Then just add text,
graphics, and other items. The Letter Wizard and prewritten business
letters can even give you a big head start in creating the text of
business correspondence. Word also includes many new templates to help
you format documents quickly.
<P>
<P><h3>AutoCorrect fixes common typing mistakes as you work</h3>
 
<P>
For example, if you type "teh", AutoCorrect replaces it with "the" as
soon as you press the SPACEBAR. You can add AutoCorrect entries for
specific errors that you want to correct. AutoCorrect can also fix
certain capitalization errors and change straight quotation marks to
curly, or "smart," quotation marks as you work. You control which
AutoCorrect options are in effect.
<P>
You can also use AutoCorrect to quickly insert words or phrases that
are long or difficult to type. For example, use AutoCorrect to replace
"asap" with "as soon as possible."
<P>
<P><h3>AutoText speeds up the addition of boilerplate text and graphics</h3>
 
<P>
Use AutoText (called the "glossary" in previous versions of Word) if
you frequently type the same words and phrases or often need to use a
particular table layout, logo, or graphic. For example, you can create
AutoText entries for:

<UL><LI>Text such as names, technical terms, and standard text for
   contracts.

<LI>Formatted items such as tables, mastheads, and lists.

<LI>Graphics such as pictures, logos, and charts.
<P>
</UL>You can use the AutoText button on the Standard toolbar to store and
insert AutoText entries. To create an AutoText entry, select the text
or graphic that you want to store, click the AutoText button, type a
name for the entry that is easy to remember, and then choose the Add
button.
<P>
<P><h3>AutoFormat analyzes a document and applies formatting for you</h3>
 
<P>
AutoFormat combines styles and templates in a powerful new way.
AutoFormat analyzes and polishes a document for you. You can quickly
reformat all or part of a document and approve the changes AutoFormat
makes.
<P>
<P><h3>Add bullets and numbers to multiple-level lists</h3>
 
<P>
Creating bulleted and numbered lists in Word is easier than ever--even
if you need to format complex multiple-level lists for legal and
technical documents. Use the Numbering button or the Bullets button on
the Formatting toolbar to set up simple lists. Use the Bullets And
Numbering command to set up a multilevel list, and then click the
Increase Indent and Decrease Indent buttons on the Formatting toolbar
to change the hierarchy of items in the list. Later, as you edit a
list, Word renumbers the items automatically.
<P>
<P><h3>Create numbered headings with built-in heading styles</h3>
 
<P>
If your documents require numbered headings, use the built-in heading
styles and the new Heading Numbering command on the Format menu. Word
numbers headings in the format that you specify and updates the
numbers whenever you move, add, or delete a heading.
<P>
<P><h3>AutoCaption helps you quickly add captions and create cross-references</h3>
 
<P>
When you insert a table, graphic, equation, or other item into a
document, Word can now automatically add a caption to it. You can
specify the label ("Figure," "Table," "Equation," and so on) that is
added to an item, and Word adds a number. If you later rearrange, add,
or delete items with captions, Word updates the numbers automatically.
<P>
To create cross-references to captions, headings, tables, and other
items, just select the item that you want to refer to from the list in
the Cross-reference dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>NEW EDITING FEATURES</h2>
 
<P>
Word includes improvements to such essential editing features as Undo,
drag-and-drop editing, and Find and Replace.
<P>
<P><h3>Fix mistakes with multiple-level Undo</h3>
 
<P>
Word keeps track of all the editing or formatting changes that you
make. To fix a single mistake or cancel certain actions such as
finding and replacing text, click the Undo button on the Standard
toolbar. To undo more than one action, click the arrow beside the Undo
button, and then select the changes that you want to reverse. If you
decide that you'd like to keep a change after all, click the Redo
button. Or click the arrow beside the Redo button, and then select the
items you want to redo.
<P>
<P><h3>Revise documents with smart cut and paste and drag-and-drop editing</h3>
 
<P>
When you cut and paste text or use drag-and-drop editing to move or
copy text, Word adjusts spaces to make the text fit its surroundings.
<P>
<P><h3>Drag and drop text and graphics across windows</h3>
 
<P>
To move or copy text, graphics, or other items from one Word window to
another, just drag and drop. You can also drag items between
applications that support OLE.
<P>
<P><h3>Use enhanced Find and Replace for more flexible searching</h3>
 
<P>
The Find and Replace commands are now both more flexible and more
straightforward. To find nonprinting characters (tab characters,
paragraph marks, page breaks, and so on), just select the item that
you're looking for from a list. With the Pattern Matching option, you
can find various sequences of characters. For example, you can search
for two or more spaces and replace them with a tab character. With the
Sounds Like option, you can search for words that sound the same but
are spelled differently, such as "color" and "colour," or words whose
spelling you aren't sure of.
<P>
<P><h2>NEW FORMATTING AND STYLE OPTIONS</h2>
 
<P>
In addition to the AutoFormat feature, Word now includes other new
ways for you to work with formatting and styles.
<P>
<P><h3>Copy formatting with the Format Painter</h3>
 
<P>
The Format Painter button provides a quick way to copy formatting.
Just "pick up" the formatting that you want to copy, and then "paint
it" onto the text you want to format. To copy formatting once, select
the formatted text and click the Format Painter button, and then
select the text you want to format. To copy formatting several times,
double-click the Format Painter button before copying the formatting.
<P>
<P><h3>Add borders and shading quickly with the new Borders toolbar</h3>
 
<P>
The Borders toolbar provides quick access to a variety of borders for
paragraphs, graphics, and frames--including dotted, dashed, and
other new border styles.
<P>
Click the Borders button on the Formatting toolbar to display the
Borders toolbar. With the Borders toolbar, you can add or remove
borders and apply shading directly in a document--without switching
between the item you want to format and a dialog box.
<P>
Just click the item you want to format, and then click buttons on the
toolbar.
<P>
Character styles bring the power of styles
<P><h3>to individual characters and words</h3>
 
<P>
With character styles, you can apply several text formats
simultaneously. For example, if you frequently apply bold and italic
formats to text, or if you often need to format text in a specific
font and size, you can save that formatting as a character style and
apply it in one step.
<P>
<P><h3>Automatic kerning helps you polish documents</h3>
 
<P>
If the fonts you use support kerning, the new kerning capabilities in
the Font dialog box (Format menu) improve the spacing between certain
letter pairs. Kerning is especially useful in headings and other text
formatted in a large font size.
<P>
<P><h3>The Organizer dialog box helps you copy and manage styles</h3>
 
<P>
You can now copy individual styles, macros, AutoText entries, and
toolbars between documents and templates. You can also use the
Organizer dialog box to rename and delete these items. From the File
menu, choose Templates or choose Style from the Format menu, and then
choose the Organizer button.
<P>
<P><h2>NEW PAGE LAYOUT CHOICES</h2>
 
<P>
Improvements to such features as newspaper-style columns and headers
and footers give you more choices in setting up pages. And now you can
see multiple pages at once in an editable "thumbnail" view.
<P>
<P><h3>Create newspaper-style columns of unequal width</h3>
 
<P>
With the Columns command on the Format menu, you can now set the width
of each newspaper-style column. You can select a preset format or
adjust the width of columns individually. Just select the text that
you want to format in columns, select a column layout, and Word
arranges the columns.
<P>
Get an overview of a document with
<P><h3>"thumbnail" pictures in print preview</h3>
 
<P>
Print preview can now show you more than two pages. You can display a
series of thumbnail pictures of a document, drag text and graphics
from one page to another, and zoom in to edit text.
<P>
<P><h2>MAIL MERGE STEP BY STEP</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Mail Merge simplifies the creation of form letters</h3>
 
<P>
Word takes you through the basic steps for creating form letters,
mailing labels, and other types of merge documents. Just choose the
Mail Merge command from the Tools menu and follow the instructions on
the screen. You can create a letter and mailing list from "scratch,"
or use an existing document and data from Microsoft Access(R),
Microsoft Excel, Microsoft FoxPro(R), or another source.
<P>
<P><h3>Print envelopes and labels easily</h3>
 
<P>
To print multiple envelopes or labels that each have a different
address, use the Mail Merge command on the Tools menu. To print just
one envelope or mailing label, or to print several with the same
address, use the Envelopes And Labels command on the Tools menu. Word
walks you through the process and handles formerly time-consuming
steps for you. You don't have to measure labels and change page
setups. With the envelope options, you can control the text format and
position of the return and delivery addresses.
<P>
<P><h3>Add bar codes and FIM marks to envelopes</h3>
 
<P>
If you send mail within the United States, you can quickly add bar
codes and Facing Identification Marks (FIM marks) to envelopes.
<P>
<P><h2>EASIER-TO-USE INTERFACE</h2>
 
<P>
In Word version 6.0, more commands, options, and features are right
where you need them. For example, new toolbars and shortcut menus give
you great flexibility as you work on documents.
<P>
<P><h3>New toolbars put more commands and options where you need them</h3>
 
<P>
Word now has specialized toolbars that you can use for tasks that
range from applying formatting to adding line drawings.
<P>
You can display or hide toolbars individually, and you can move them
around on the screen so that they're accessible, yet out of the way as
you work. You can also add, remove, and rearrange toolbar buttons. You
can even create custom buttons (and create graphics for them) to run
macros, apply formatting, or carry out commands that you use often.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Use ToolTips or Balloon Help to find out about toolbar buttons</h3>
 
<P>
When you point to a toolbar button and pause, Word shows you the name
of the button. You can use Balloon Help(TM) to display more detailed
descriptions of the toolbar buttons.
<P>
<P><h3>Shortcut menus and an improved status bar help you work quickly</h3>
 
<P>
You can now carry out many common commands by using shortcut menus.
For example, if you are working in a table, press COMMAND+OPTION+click
to see a menu of frequently used commands such as Insert Rows and
Delete Rows. You don't have to move the mouse pointer up to the menu
bar or search a long menu for a particular command.
<P>
Click buttons on the horizontal scroll bar to change views quickly.
Click indicators in the status bar to switch between insert and
overtype modes.
<P>
<P><h3>Full screen view maximizes the text area on your screen</h3>
 
<P>
Full screen view quickly hides toolbars, rulers, scroll bars, and
other screen items so that you can see more of a document as you work.
To restore the previous screen arrangement, click the Full Screen
button that remains at the bottom of the screen.
<P>
<P><h2>CUSTOMIZE WORD WITH NEW OPTIONS</h2>
 
<P>
Word is one of the most flexible word-processing applications. You can
add or delete commands from menus, create new menus, assign key
combinations of your choice, and customize the appearance of the Word
screen.
<P>
<P><h3>Drag buttons to customize toolbars</h3>
 
<P>
You can customize the built-in toolbars by adding, deleting, or moving
buttons. To move a button between toolbars, hold down the COMMAND key
and drag the button to the new location. To remove a button, just hold
down the COMMAND key and drag the button off the toolbar. You can also
use the Customize command on the Tools menu to add, delete, or move
buttons.
<P>
You can use the Customize command to create toolbar buttons or to make
custom toolbars from "scratch." You can also use the Customize command
to modify the contents of menus and create new shortcut keys.
<P>
<P><h3>Make Word work the way you work</h3>
 
<P>
You can use the Options command on the Tools menu to change default
directories or folders for documents and templates, modify the
appearance of the Word screen, and set other options to suit the way
you work.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKGROUP FEATURES</h2>
 
<P>
Word now includes more features to help you create, distribute, and
produce documents in a workgroup.
<P>
<P><h3>Master documents organize large, complex documents</h3>
 
<P>
To manage a long document that includes many files, create a master
document.
<P>
With the Master Document toolbar, which is displayed when you choose
Master Document from the View menu, you can add, delete, reorganize,
merge, split, and lock subdocuments. Using a master document also
simplifies creation of cross-references, an index, a table of
contents, or tables of figures or authorities for long documents.
<P>
<P><h3>Send documents to reviewers with the Add Routing Slip command</h3>
 
<P>
If you have Microsoft Mail or a compatible mail package, you can send
copies of a document to reviewers. You can send a document to several
reviewers simultaneously or route a single copy from one reviewer to
another in the sequence that you specify.
<P>
<P><h3>New annotation features speed up reviews</h3>
 
<P>
You can now mark text for annotations. Selected items are highlighted,
so instead of typing a long annotation like "Delete the second
sentence in this paragraph," you can just type "Delete." When you
consider comments from others, you can view all annotations at once or
only those from a single reviewer.
<P>
<P><h3>Revision tracking shows you who did what when</h3>
 
<P>
Revision marking now shows you who made a change and when the change
was entered. Including the date and time can help you determine if a
comment is still relevant or if it has been superseded by new
information. You can display or hide revision marks as you edit a
document and select the color and character formatting used to mark
changes.
<P>
<P><h3>Create forms to fill in on-screen</h3>
 
<P>
The new Forms toolbar makes it easy to create a complex form with text
fields, check boxes, and drop-down lists. You can even provide
customized help text for each part of a form.
<P>
<P><h2>GETTING HELP AND LEARNING WORD</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Use online Help to answer your questions</h3>
 
<P>
The online Help available as you work with Word is more accessible and
useful than ever before. Whenever you have a question, just double-
click the Help button on the Standard toolbar.
<P>
A booklike index helps you get to specific information quickly.
Examples and demos briefly introduce and explain features.
<P>
NOTE: The Examples And Demos and Quick Preview commands are available
in Word 6.0 for the Macintosh only if you choose the complete
installation option, or if you choose the custom installation option,
select Online Help, and then select Examples And Demos. You must have
Word Help installed for these features to work correctly.
<P>
<PRE>  You can now navigate more easily through topics by using buttons at
  the top of the Word Help window.

</PRE><h3>"Tip of the Day" makes you an expert one step at a time</h3>
 
<P>
Each time you start Word, you'll see a tip about how to use Word more
effectively. Tips tell you about useful shortcuts, suggest new ways to
use familiar features, and introduce you to some of the new
capabilities in Word.
