The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word some graphics (especially large ones) may not be 
displayed. In their place, a blank box appears, both in your document and 
in print preview. The graphic prints correctly, however.
<P>
Opening and closing the document does not redisplay the graphic.
<P>
This happens even if the Picture Placeholders option in the View options 
dialog box is not selected (to open this dialog box, click Options on the 
Tools menu and then select the View tab).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes the graphic is displayed when you first open the file; if you 
then edit the graphic by double-clicking it and then close the picture
editing window, the graphic disappears.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Sometimes you can redisplay the graphic by copying it to the Clipboard, 
quitting and restarting Word, and then pasting the graphic in your
Word document. Regardless of whether the graphic is displayed, it is 
printed correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
The file size and complexity needs to be reduced for the graphic to
be displayed. A graphics program, such as Adobe Photo Shop or JASC Inc. 
Paint Shop, is required to reduce the resolution of the graphic. Decreasing 
the resolution reduces the graphic's file size allowing it to be displayed. 
For example, if a graphic has a resolution of 3600 x 4400 pixels at 600 
dots per inch (dpi), decreasing its resolution by half (1800 x 2200) at 
fewer dots per inch (75 dpi) allows the graphic to be displayed. This can 
reduce the file size from 2 megabytes to 500 kilobytes.
<P>

the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
