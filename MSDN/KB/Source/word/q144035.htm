The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The removal of the "Most Recently Used" list from the File menu may be
necessary for security purposes in some work settings. If you do not
want the "Most Recently Used" list to appear use the procedure appropriate
for your version of Word.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Word 2.x</h3>
 
<P>
When a file is deleted from the disk or moved, its name may still be
present in this list of names. If an unavailable file is selected, a
message will appear stating that Word for Windows cannot find this
file. Choose the Cancel button, and the file should be deleted from
the list.
<P>
The removal of the "Most Recently Used" list from the File menu may be
necessary for security purposes in some work settings. If you do not
want the "Most Recently Used" list to appear in Word 2.0, you can add a
parameter to the WIN.INI file under the [Microsoft Word 2.0] section to
eliminate this list. The following setting disables the list of file
names on the File menu:
<P>
<PRE>   NoFileCache=Yes

</PRE>To set this option, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Options, and select the WIN.INI
   category.

<P><LI>In the Application box, select Microsoft Word 2.0.

<P><LI>Type: NoFileCache, in the Option box.

<P><LI>Type: Yes, in the Settings box.

<P><LI>Choose the Set button to record the setting.

<P><LI>Choose the Close button.
<P>
</OL><h3>Word 1.x</h3>
 
<P>
In Word 1.x, you can create a global AutoExec macro that replaces the
file list with four empty files which you must create and save to the
Word for Windows program directory before you use the macro.
<P>
NOTE: When you delete a file in Word 1.x, the functionality is the same
as that of Word 2.0, described in the "Word 2.x" section of this article.
<P>
To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose New. Choose the OK button to create a
   new document based on the Normal template.

<P><LI>From the Macro menu, choose Edit. Type AUTOEXEC in the Edit Macro
   Name box, and select Global in the Show box. Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>In the macro-editing window, type the following macro text:
<P>

RISK. Microsoft provides this macro code "as is" without warranty of any

<P>
<PRE>      Sub MAIN
         FileOpen .Name = "c:\winword\test1.doc"
         FileOpen .Name = "c:\winword\test2.doc"
         FileOpen .Name = "c:\winword\test3.doc"
         FileOpen .Name = "c:\winword\test4.doc"
         FileClose
         FileClose
         FileClose
         FileClose
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save All. When the dialog box prompts
   you to save changes to Global:AUTOEXEC, choose the Yes button.
   Choose the Yes button again when prompted to save global glossary
   and command changes.

<P><LI>Create four new files and save them to the WINWORD directory with
   the file names "test1.doc" through "test4.doc."
