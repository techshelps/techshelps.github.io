The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, and 2.0b
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Word for Windows macro language is stored in a
"tokenized" format. This means that Word saves a code that represents
each keyword, such as ".Name" or "EditFind." When you load a macro
into a macro window, Word decodes these tokens into words for the
native language of the Word for Windows program. As a result, macro
translation is much simpler across languages if the macro is stored as
part of a template rather than in a text file format.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Literal strings are not translated between languages. This includes
the menu text for user macros and macro descriptions that appear on
the status bar. Additionally, none of the messages or macro comments
are translated. Accelerators in dialog boxes differ between different
localized versions of Word for Windows; therefore, the WordBasic
SendKeys command must be translated. Field keywords are translated to
different languages, but text literals in fields such as QUOTE are not
translated. The Word for Windows automatic style names are translated,
but user-created style names are not translated.
<P>
Bookmarks (including special bookmarks), glossary names, and field
names within macros are not translated between languages. The name of
the Spike glossary is translated, but other glossary names are not
translated. Keywords in the Win.ini file are not translated.
<P>
Built-in macro names are translated to the native language of Word for
Windows. As a result, the following ToolsMacro command would not work
in another language:
<P>
<PRE>   ToolsMacro "ShowHeading1", .Run

</PRE>If you specify FormatPageSetup .LeftMargin = "1" in the United States
version of Word, it will indicate 1 inch in the United States version;
however, in the German version, the same command will indicate 1
centimeter. A possible workaround for this situation is to use numeric
variables that are interpreted as points (for example, FormatPageSetup
.LeftMargin = "72 pt").
<P>
NOTE: The default measurement unit and decimal separator in most languages
is different from the defaults in the English version of Word for Windows.
For example, FormatPageSetup .LeftMargin = "72.5 pt" causes an error
message in countries that use a comma as the decimal separator.
