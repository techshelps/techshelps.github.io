The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to use the RecordNextCommand macro to record the syntax of
the next WordBasic command executed into an open macro window in Microsoft
Word.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The RecordNextCommand macro can be helpful when you are writing a macro and
are unsure of the syntax for a particular command. The RecordNextCommand
will insert the syntax of the next command executed into the open macro
window.
<P>
<P><h3>Word versions 6.x, 7.x</h3>
 
<P>
To activate the RecordNextCommand in Word for Windows 6.0 and 7.0, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>In the Macro Editor, place the insertion point at the spot
   where you want the recorded command to begin.

<P><LI>Switch to an open document window from the Window menu or by
   pressing CTRL+F6 (COMMAND+F6 in WORD for the Macintosh), or open a new
   document.

<P><LI>From the Macro Editor toolbar, which is still showing above the Ruler,
   press the button second from left, a dot with a number "1" next to it.
   (If you're not sure which button, the Toolbar Hint will say
   "RecordNextCommand" when your mouse pointer is positioned on the
<P><PRE>    button.)
</PRE>
<P><LI>Your mouse pointer will show an icon resembling an audio cassette, to
   indicate that the Macro Recorder is active.

<P><LI>Perform the action that is to be recorded into your macro.
   (You can re-press the button to abort the recording.)

<P><LI>Once the command is completed, the recorder will place the command
   syntax into the macro window. Switch back to the open macro sheet to
   view the recorded syntax.
<P>
</OL>There is no pre-assigned shortcut key for RecordNextCommand in Word for
Windows version 6.x. For information about creating a shortcut key or
assigning RecordNextCommand to a menu or toolbar, refer to pages 716-728 of
the Microsoft Word for Windows version 6.0 "User's Guide."
<P>
<P><h3>Word for Windows version 2.x</h3>
 
<P>
To activate the RecordNextCommand in Word for Windows 2.x, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Switch to an open document window from the Window menu or open a
   document. (Make sure that you have a macro window open as well by
   choosing Edit from the Macro menu, giving a name to your macro, and
   then pressing ENTER.)

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Macro and press ALT+C to select the
   Commands option button in the Show box.
<P>
<P><PRE>    This selects all macro commands.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select RecordNextCommand from the list of available macros and
   press ENTER. (Make sure that you have opened a macro menu at this
   point by selecting Macro from the Tools menu and giving your macro
   a name. Choose Edit to open a macro window).

<P><LI>"REC" will now appear in the status bar at the bottom of the
   Word for Windows screen to indicate that the Macro Recorder is
   active.

<P><LI>Perform the command that is to be recorded into the macro sheet.
<P>
</OL><h3>Word for Windows versions 1.x</h3>
 
<P>
To use the RecordNextCommand macro in Word for Windows version 1.x,
position the cursor on the line where the recorded syntax should
appear in the macro window, and do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Switch to an open document window from the Window menu or open a
   document. (Make sure that you have a macro window open as well by
   choosing Edit from the Macro menu, giving a name to your macro, and
   then pressing ENTER.)

<P><LI>On the Macro menu, click Run and press ALT+A to select the
   Show All check box (if not already selected).

<P><LI>Select RecordNextCommand from the list of available macros and
   press ENTER.

<P><LI>"REC" will now appear in the status bar at the bottom of the
   Word for Windows screen to indicate that the Macro Recorder is
   active.

<P><LI>Perform the command that is to be recorded into the macro sheet.
<P>
</OL>Once the command is completed, the recorder will place the command
syntax into the macro window. Switch back to the open macro sheet
to view the recorded syntax.
<P>
NOTE: If no macro windows are open, the RecordNextCommand macro
will beep when executed.
<P>

using the Assign To Menu function (refer to page 195 of the "Microsoft
Word for Windows User's Reference" for more information on adding
macros to menus).
