The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to save a file as the file type of Word 6.0/95 (*.doc), the
choice does not appear in the Save As Type list in the Save As dialog box
(click Save As on the File menu), even when the converter is installed
properly.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, try Methods 1 and 2 first. Use Method 3 only
as a last resort.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Check for the Converter</h3>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Close Microsoft Word.

<P><LI>Right-click Start, and then click Explore to start the Explorer.

<P><LI>Find the following folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Textconv
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This is the default setting; this may be different if you changed
   the default location of Word.

<P><LI>Look for the Wrd6ex32.cnv file.
<P>
   If the file is not there, then you probably have not installed it. You
   will need to add the converter. Use the following article to help you in
   that process.
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../OFFICE/Q120802.htm">Q120802</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Office: How to Add/Remove a Single Office
                  Program or Component

   If WRD6EX32.CNV is located in the proper place, then proceed to step 5.

</PRE><P><LI>Start Microsoft Word and type some text in the new blank document.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As. In the Save As Type box, select Text
   Only, name the file, and then click Save.

<P><LI>Close the file.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, select the General tab, click to
   select Confirm Conversion At Open, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Re-open the Text Only file as a text file. On the File menu, click Save
   As and check to see if the File As Type of Word 6.0/95 is displayed.
<P>
</OL>Step 2: Rename and Re-Install the Converter
 
<P>
Rename Wrd6ex32.cnv and then reinstall the converter. There are many ways
that this converter could have been installed. If you have the Microsoft
Office CD, you can copy the converter from the following location on the
CD:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;CD Drive&gt;\OS\MSAPPS\TEXTCONV

</PRE></OL>It should be copied to the following folder:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Textconv

</PRE>For additional information about how to obtain this converter, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : WD97: Updated Word 6.0/95 Export Converter Available

</PRE>Step 3: Check the Microsoft Windows 95 Registry for Proper Settings
 
<P>
If steps 1 and 2 did not work, you will need to look at a registry key
called MSWord6Exp, which governs this particular Save As Type option. This
key is found in two places within the Microsoft Windows 95 Registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
To review, change, or add the settings for MSWord6Exp, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail.

<P><LI>On the Windows taskbar, click Start and then click Run.

<P><LI>In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and
   click OK.

<P><LI>Locate the following key by clicking the plus signs in front of the
   appropriate folders.
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\MSWord6Exp
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click MSWORD6EXP once to select and to open its folder. To export this
   registry key to the desktop, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. On the Registry menu, click Export Registry File.
<P>
   b. Beside File Name, type your name, note the location of the Save In
<P><PRE>      (default is desktop), and then click Save. A file named,
      &lt;Yourname&gt;.reg, will now appear on the desktop for recovery purposes,
      if necessary.
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the right side of the Registry Editor, under Name, there should be a
   (Default) and Path setting. Under Data, the (Default) item will read
   (value not set.). The Path item should read:
<P>
<P><PRE>     "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Textconv\WRD6EX32.CNV"
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This is the default setting; this may be different if you changed
   the default location of Word.

<P><LI>If the Path is incorrect, double-click Path (under Name) and under the
   Value Data, change the path to point to where the file WRD6Ex32.CNV is
   located.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Locate the second entry for the MSWord6Exp key location by clicking the
   plus sign in front of the appropriate folders.
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Text Converters\
      Export\MSWord6Exp
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the right side of the Windows 95 Registry Editor, under Name, you
   should see the following entries:
<P>
<PRE>   Name                  Data

   Extensions            "doc"
   Name                  "Word 6.0/95"
   Path                  "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\
                            Textconv\WRD6EX32.CNV"


   NOTE: This is the default setting; this may be different if you changed
   the default location of Word.

</PRE><P><LI>Correct or add the registry keys by doing one of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    If the entry is incorrect:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    Select the incorrect Name string, and then, on the Edit menu, click
    Modify. Under Value Data, type in the correct data as stated in step 9.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    If the entry is missing:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    If these settings are missing, then the entries within the registry
    will have to be created. To do this within the Microsoft Windows 95
    Registry, follow the steps in the "How To Add a Microsoft Windows 95
    Registry Key," section later in this document.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Close Registry Editor.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Add a Microsoft Windows 95 Registry Key</h3>
 
<P>

<OL><P><LI>Select the already existing key under which the new key is to be created
   (for example, select Export).

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, point to New and then click Key. Enter WSWord6Exp as
   the name and then press Enter.

<P><LI>Select the new key (MSWord6Exp) and on the Edit menu, point to New and
   then click String Value.

<P><LI>On the right side of the Registry Editor, select the New Value #x and
   type in any of the missing items and then press ENTER. The missing items

<P>
<P><PRE>      Extensions
      Name
      Path
</PRE>

      Extensions            doc
      Name                  Word 6.0/95
      Path                  C:\Program Files\Common Files\
                               Microsoft Shared\Textconv\WRD6EX32.CNV

</PRE><P><LI>Repeat steps 3-5 until all of the proper string items have been put in
   place under the proper keys.

<P><LI>On the Registry menu, click Exit.
<P>

as a Text Only document, closing it, and then re-opening it with Confirm
Conversions turned. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options and then select the General tab.

<P><LI>Click to select Confirm Conversion At Open.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>This will initialize the converters and force them to work properly.
