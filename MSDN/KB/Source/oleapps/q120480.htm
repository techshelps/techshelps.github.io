The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Organization Chart for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you reactivate a Microsoft Organization Chart 1.0 object or start a
new one, you receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Error reading drive &lt;x&gt;:

   -or-

   System error cannot read from drive &lt;x&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;x&gt; is the letter assigned to your CD-ROM drive.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when a CD-ROM-based application was installed with an
option to leave its fonts on the CD-ROM. It also occurs if any fonts were
explicitly loaded in the Fonts Control Panel from the CD-ROM drive but the
font files were not copied to the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of the methods below to prevent this error message.
<P>
<P><h3>Insert a Compact Disc Before Running Graph or Organization Chart</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Organization Chart looks to the CD-ROM drive only to see if a
compact disc (CD) exists. If any CD (other than a music CD) is in the drive
at the time you start Organization Chart, the above error message is not
displayed.
<P>
<P><h3>Install the Fonts to the Local Hard Disk Drive</h3>
 
<P>
Many fonts that come on CDs are packaged with software that uses an
installation program which allows you to choose where to store the fonts.
If available, use the installation program to install the fonts on the
local hard disk drive.
<P>
If no installation program is available, you can reinstall the fonts to the
local hard disk drive with the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Program Manager, choose Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Fonts icon.

<P><LI>In the Installed Fonts list, select all of the fonts that came on the
   CD. To select more than one font, hold down the CTRL key and click each
   font with the mouse.

<P><LI>Choose the Remove button to remove the selected fonts. Choose Yes or Yes
   To All to confirm their removal.

<P><LI>Choose Add. Make sure that the option to Copy Fonts To Windows Directory
   is selected.

<P><LI>From the Drives list, select the CD-ROM drive. Make sure the disk is in
   the CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>In the Directories window, locate the directory that contains the fonts
   to be installed.

<P><LI>To select the fonts to install, hold down the CTRL key and click each
   font with the mouse.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you choose Cancel twice when the error is displayed, the dialog box is
closed and Organization Chart is started. If a font from the CD-ROM is used
during the session, the same error occurs. Choosing Cancel repeatedly at
this point eventually does select the font; however, after you exit and
return to the client application and then later return to the Organization
Chart object you created, the font format reverts to the System font.
