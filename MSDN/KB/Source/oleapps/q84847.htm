The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Equation Editor version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If Microsoft Equation Editor version 1.0 displays or prints equations
incorrectly, the problem may be related to the configuration of Microsoft
Word version 2.0 for Windows (the client application with which Equation
Editor ships), Equation Editor, or the Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.0 or 3.1.
<P>
This article describes common causes of display and printing problems you
may encounter in Equation Editor. It is designed as a troubleshooting
checklist to assist you in diagnosing and resolving these problems in
Windows version 3.1 and Windows version 3.0.
<P>
For more troubleshooting information about size, position or palettes,
query on the following word here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   EEPREFS.PRE

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Preliminary Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<P>
If your equations are displaying or printing incorrectly or the error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Adequate Symbol font is not available

</PRE>make sure the correct font is assigned to each style. From the Equation
Editor Style menu, choose Define. The correct fonts for the Lowercase
Greek, Uppercase Greek, and Symbol styles should be listed as follows:
<P>
<PRE>Style              Font                    Font
Name               Windows 3.0             Windows 3.1
-----              -----------             -----------

Lowercase Greek    MT Symbol               Symbol

Uppercase Greek    MT Symbol               Symbol

Symbol             MT Symbol               Symbol

</PRE>If an incorrect font is listed for one of these styles, select the
correct font, and choose the OK button.
<P>
When you start Equation Editor, the following sequence of error messages
occurs if the Fences or MT Extra TrueType fonts are damaged, corrupted, or
not installed:
<P>
<PRE>   Equation Editor's &lt;fontname&gt; font is not available on the default
   printer. Some characters will not display or print. Choose a different
   printer or reinstall the Equation Editor to properly install its fonts.

      followed by:

   Equation Editor's equation memory is running low.

</PRE>To verify this problem, start Control Panel and choose the Fonts icon. If
Control Panel indicates that the font is corrupted, remove and then
reinstall the font or fonts using the following instructions:

<OL><P><LI>Start Control Panel and choose the Fonts icon.

<P><LI>Select the corrupted font (Fences or MT Extra).

<P><LI>Choose the Remove button and choose Yes when prompted.

<P><LI>Choose the Add button.

<P><LI>Select the font (Fences or MT Extra), which is located in your
   WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory. Choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Sample box, the font you reinstalled should now display
   correctly, and you should no longer get the above error messages
   in Word.
<P>
</OL>Note: If the problem persists, delete the FENCES.TTF and MTEXTRA.TTF files
in your WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory and then reinstall Equation Editor.
<P>
If your equations are not displaying and/or printing at all, one of
the following settings may be the cause:

<OL><P><LI>Draft View. Open the View menu. If there is a check mark next to
   Draft, your equations will not be displayed on the screen, but they
   will print correctly. Choose Draft to return to normal view.

<P><LI>Picture Placeholders. From the Tools menu, choose Options. Under
   Category, select View. If the Picture Placeholders option is selected,
   clear the check box, and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Draft Output. From the Tools menu, choose Options. Under Category,
   select Print. If the Draft Output option is selected, your equations
   will be displayed on the screen, but they will not print. Clear the
   Draft Output check box, and choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL><h3>Microsoft Windows Operating System Version 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
If your Equation Editor mathematical symbols are displayed incorrectly
on the screen after upgrading from Windows version 3.0, there may be a
conflict between Windows version 3.0 and Windows version 3.1 Equation
Editor fonts. There may also be extra printer entries in your Windows
WIN.INI file that need to be removed.
<P>
Conflicts may arise if Equation Editor fonts for both Windows version
3.0 and Windows version 3.1 are installed on your system at the same
time. To avoid possible conflicts, remove the Windows version 3.0
bitmap fonts by choosing the Fonts icon in the Windows Control Panel,
selecting the fonts listed below, and choosing the Remove button.
<P>
<PRE>   Fences
   MT Extra
   MT Symbol
   Symbol

</PRE></OL>Note: These font names include resolution (such as EGA, VGA, or 8514/a
Res) and/or font size information (such as 8, 10, 12, 18, or 24).
<P>
The correct fonts appear as follows in the Fonts dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>Fences   (TrueType)       -or-       Fences Plain   (TrueType)
Symbol   (TrueType)       -or-       Symbol Plain   (TrueType)
MT Extra (TrueType)       -or-       MT Extra Plain (TrueType)
Symbol   (TrueType)       -or-       Symbol Plain   (TrueType)

</PRE>Note: If the font name includes the word "Plain," the font was deleted
and reinstalled previously.
<P>
After you install the correct Equation Editor fonts as described
above, your "old" equations will still be formatted with the Windows
3.0 bitmap fonts and may continue to be displayed incorrectly. To
update your equations with the newly installed fonts, select the
equation, and choose Equation Object from the Edit menu. If you edit
the equation, the font assignments will be updated. (You may need to
add and delete a character in the equation to force it to be updated.)
<P>
If there are multiple references to the Equation Editor fonts in the
printer sections of the WIN.INI file, you may experience incorrect
display and/or printing problems with Equation Editor equations. To
remove extraneous printer entries, open your WIN.INI file in a text
editor, and delete any duplicate printer sections. Save the WIN.INI
file, exit Windows, then restart Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Transfer of Equations from Windows 3.0 to Windows 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
If an equation created in Windows 3.0 is brought into Windows 3.1, the
MT Symbol fonts often map to Wingdings instead of Symbol. The
following line in the [FontSubstitutes] section of the WIN.INI file
corrects this problem:
<P>
<PRE>   MT Symbol=Symbol

</PRE>Version 2.0b of Word for Windows corrects this problem by
automatically adding this change to the WIN.INI file during Setup.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Windows Operating System Version 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
If Equation Editor mathematical symbols are displayed on the screen
correctly but print incorrectly, the screen fonts are probably
installed correctly. The problem may involve the soft font files or
the active printer.
<P>
The soft font files that were downloaded to a laser or PostScript
printer may have been deleted or corrupted on the hard drive. If this
has occurred, the printer will substitute a printer-resident font for
the Equation Editor font. Verify that the Equation Editor fonts are
installed correctly for the active printer. Look for the Equation
Editor font files in the C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\EQUATION directory. Open
the Windows WIN.INI file, check the Equation Editor font entries in
the active printer section, and delete any duplicate printer sections.
<P>
Note: To correct this problem, it is often easiest to delete font
files from the hard drive, delete entries from the WIN.INI file, and
rerun the Word for Windows Setup program. By choosing the Custom
Installation Setup option, you can reinstall the Equation Editor and
thereby reinstall the Equation Editor fonts for the active printer.
<P>
If your active printer is a dot-matrix printer, you cannot print
Equation Editor soft fonts. (Soft fonts cannot be downloaded to
dot-matrix printers.) For more information on the Equation Editor and
dot-matrix printers in Windows version 3.0, query on the following
words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   equation and editor and dot and matrix and fonts

</PRE>If this problem persists, reinstall the Equation Editor using the Word
for Windows version 2.0a Setup program.
<P>
Note: A PostScript printer or HP-compatible laser printer must be
installed, active, and set as the default printer on a valid printer
port prior to reinstalling Equation Editor. "File:" is not a valid
printer port; if you choose the Printer icon in the Control Panel and
configure the printer port to "File:", the Equation Editor fonts will
not be installed correctly.
<P>

following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
