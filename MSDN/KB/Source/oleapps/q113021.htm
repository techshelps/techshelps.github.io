<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft ClipArt Gallery for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When there is insufficient disk space on the drive that contains your
thumbnail file for Microsoft ClipArt Gallery for Windows, you receive the
following error message when you add thumbnails or collections of
thumbnails to ClipArt Gallery:
<P>
<PRE>   The ClipArt Gallery cannot write thumbnail file.
   Your disk may be full or you may not have permission to write files on
   this disk.

</PRE>To complete the importing of the clip art thumbnails, you must make more
disk space available on the drive that contains the index and thumbnail
database files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The ClipArt Gallery index file is ARTGALRY.IDX and the thumbnail database
file is ARTGALRY.THM.
<P>
If you are not running a shared version of Windows, these files are located
in the same directory as the Microsoft ClipArt Gallery program and help
files, &lt;Windows Folder&gt;\Msapps\Artgalry.
<P>
If you are running a shared version of Windows and are sharing the
Microsoft ClipArt Gallery from a network, the index and thumbnail database
files are located in your Windows directory.
<P>
Many Microsoft programs ship with thumbnail collections for the clip
art graphics that are included with the application. ClipArt Gallery tries
to merge these new thumbnails with its existing thumbnail database file the
first time you attempt to insert a Microsoft ClipArt Gallery object
following the installation of the product that provided the new clip art.
<P>
The Setup programs for the applications that include these thumbnail
collections do not take into account the situation in which the ClipArt
Gallery thumbnail database and index files are located on a drive other than the
drive where the program and its clip art files are installed.
<P>
The Microsoft program with which you are most likely to encounter this
problem is Microsoft PowerPoint 4.0 for Windows. If you install PowerPoint
on a drive that is different from the location of your ClipArt Gallery
thumbnail database and index files and you install all the clip art files
that are provided with PowerPoint, you will need 2.7 megabytes of free disk
space on the drive containing your ClipArt Gallery index and thumbnail
files are stored in order to add all the clip art thumbnails to the
gallery. (This is because PowerPoint ships with over 1,000 clip art
images.)
