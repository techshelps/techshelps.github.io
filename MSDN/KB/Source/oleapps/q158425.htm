The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Clip Gallery for Windows 95, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Publisher 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows 95 and Windows NT, you can have multiple user profiles. If
you import some Clip Gallery Packages (.cag files) into your Clip
Gallery from a network drive, and you then log off your computer and
log on as a different user, you may receive an error similar to the
following when you start Clip Gallery:
<P>
<PRE>   Clip Gallery cannot open the previews file
   \\Server\Share\Folder\File Name.cag.

   That file is on a network. The file may have been removed or the
   network server may not be available. Attempting to open that file
   causes Clip Gallery to launch slowly.

</PRE>If you select the "Don't Attempt To Open That File in the Future"
check box and then click OK, the clipart stored in that preview file
is removed from your Clip Gallery. If you then log off your computer
and then log back on as yourself, the clipart is still gone.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If one user profile does not have access to a network drive that
contains a .cag file, you get the error when you log in as that user.
If you select the "Don't Attempt To Open That File in the Future"
check box, the key in the Windows Registry that tells Clip Gallery
about that file is deleted. This particular key is shared by all user
profiles on your computer. If this key is deleted, it is deleted for
all user profiles.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you receive the error, and you don't have the only user profile for
your computer, don't select the "Don't Attempt To Open That File in
the Future" check box.
<P>
If you have already deleted the clips, use the following steps to add
them back in:

<OL><P><LI>Start Publisher or PowerPoint (or some other OLE destination
   program).

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Object. Select Microsoft Clip Gallery
   from the Object Types list.

<P><LI>In Clip Gallery, click Import Clips.

<P><LI>From the Files of Type list, select Clip Gallery Packages.

<P><LI>Navigate to the folder that contains a .cag file.

<P><LI>Click the file that corresponds to the collection you want to
   import and click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
