The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Clipart Gallery, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft WordArt, version 2.0
<LI>Microsoft Graph, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to use one of the shared programs that is installed with
Microsoft Office, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The server program, source file, or item cannot be found.
   You should reinstall the server program.

</PRE>The shared programs that ship with Microsoft Office include:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Clipart Gallery
<LI>Microsoft Map (Data Map Office 7.0 and earlier)
<LI>Microsoft Equation Editor
<LI>Microsoft Graph
<LI>Microsoft Organization Chart
<LI>Microsoft WordArt
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by incorrect or missing OLE information in the
Windows 95 or Windows NT 3.51 registry. When you try to insert an object
created by Microsoft Graph, for example, and you get the error, it means
that the information in the registry about where to find Microsoft Graph is
missing or is incorrect.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, re-register the shared program in question.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
NOTE: The shared programs that ship with Microsoft Office for Windows
are self-registering.
<P>
<P><h3>To reregister shared programs</h3>
 
<P>
To reregister any of the shared programs, run the executable file (.exe)
for the affected program. You can run the executable in any of several
ways:

<UL><LI>Double-click the executable from My Computer or Windows Explorer.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Click Run on the Start menu, then click the Browse button to
   locate the appropriate executable file.
<P>
</UL>In many cases you will receive a message similar to the following:

<UL><LI>Clipart Gallery may only be used to embed objects. It must be
   started from within another program.
<P>
   - or -

<LI>Clip Gallery is now configured to run on your computer
<P>
</UL>In most cases, the shared program should now be registered correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>Exporting Keys from the Registry</h3>
 
<P>
If the above method for registering the program does not work, use the
following steps to try exporting keys related to the shared program, and
then reregister the program:
<P>
<PRE>   WARNING: Ensure that you have read through and are familiar with this
   procedure prior to attempting it. One missed step could have a
   significantly negative impact on your system!

</PRE><P><LI>In Windows 95, click the Start button, and then click Run.

<P><LI>In the Open box, type "REGEDIT" (without the quotation marks), then
   click OK.

<P><LI>Click the plus sign to the left of HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT

<P><LI>Scroll down to locate the shared program's registry key.
<P>
<P><PRE>    NOTE: The shared programs are all referred to with a prefix of "MS," as
    in "MSWordArt2" or "MS_ClipArt_Gallery."
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click the key to select it.

<P><LI>On the Registry menu, click Export Registry File. In Save in, specify
   Desktop.

<P><LI>Provide a name for the registry file, then click Save. Look on the
   desktop to verify that the registry key has been saved there
   successfully.

<P><LI>Return to Regedit. With the Registry key still highlighted, click Delete
   on the Edit menu. When prompted with the question "Are you sure you want
   to delete this key?", click Yes.

<P><LI>Reregister the shared program by running its executable (.exe) file.
<P>
</OL><h3>Rebuilding the Original Office for Windows 95 Registry Settings</h3>
 
<P>
If the problem persists, you may need to rebuild your original Office 95
registry entries by running Office Setup. To do this, use the following
command
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;drive&gt;:setup /y

</PRE></OL>where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive that contains the Office Setup disk. This
parameter will force Office for Windows 95 to go into maintenance mode.
If you then click Reinstall, the Setup program will rewrite the registry
based on your previous installation. Note that it will restore all of the
program defaults.
<P>
<P><h3>Reinstalling the Operating System</h3>
 
<P>
If the problem still exists after following the steps listed above, you may
need to reinstall your operating system. For instructions on how to
reinstall Windows 95 or Windows NT, please consult your  operating system
documentation.
