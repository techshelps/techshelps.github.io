The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Organization Chart for the Macintosh, version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft ClipArt Gallery for the Macintosh, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to start Organization Chart or ClipArt Gallery, you
receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   The server application, source file, or item cannot be found.
   Make sure the application is properly installed and that it has
   not been deleted, moved, or renamed.

      -or-

   Cannot start the source application for this object.

</PRE>followed by one of the following Finder level messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Organization Chart
   ------------------
   Unable to Load Object Linking and Embedding Libraries

   ClipArt Gallery
   ---------------
   Could not load DLL's. Exiting program.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The above error may be caused by one of the following conditions:
<P>
Case 1: The Shared Code Manager and the Shared Code Folder are missing,
<PRE>        damaged, or not installed. The Shared Code Manager is an extension
        (located in your System:Extensions folder) that loads the dynamic-
        link library (dll) files stored in the Shared Code Folder. The dll
        files are:

           OLE Client Dll
           OLE Reg Dll
           OLE Server Dll

</PRE>Case 2: PowerPoint has never been installed, but you installed the
<PRE>        Organization Chart during Office setup.

</PRE>Case 3: You did not load the Shared Code Manager (for example, you
<PRE>        turned off the Shared Code Manager in the System 7.5 Extensions
        Manager; or, if you are using an earlier version of the System
        software, you moved the Shared Code Manager or Shared Code
        Folder out of the Extensions folder).

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Case 1: Remove the Shared Code Manager and the Shared Code Folder and
<PRE>        reinstall or install PowerPoint 4.0.

</PRE>Case 2: Install PowerPoint 4.0.
<P>
<PRE>        NOTE: If you have limited disk space, you can run Setup in
        maintenance mode to remove the PowerPoint files. The Shared
        Code Manager and Shared Code folder will not be removed.

</PRE>Case 3: Move the Shared Code Manager back into your System:Extensions
<PRE>        folder or turn on the Shared Code Manager in the Extensions
        Manager (System 7.5).

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Organization Chart after you remove PowerPoint, Word uses a
macro called OrganizationalChartMaker to create the chart. The macro is
located in the Word 6.0 Macros template in your Microsoft Office:Microsoft
Word 6:Macros folder. The OrganizationalChartMaker macro creates your chart
based on Heading Styles in your Word document. If you did not format your
text with Heading styles, the OrganizationalChartMaker macro will provide
you with additional information to run the macro.
<P>
A printer must be selected in the Chooser before you can run Microsoft
Organization Chart.
