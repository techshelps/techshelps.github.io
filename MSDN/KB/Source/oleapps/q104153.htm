The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Publisher versions 2.0, 2.0a
<LI>Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Products listed above, you may receive an error message in
WordArt indicating that you do not have TrueType fonts installed even if
you do. When you try to launch WordArt, the following error message may
appear:
<P>
<PRE>   WordArt needs TrueType fonts to produce WordArt effects. There are
   no TrueType fonts accessible on your computer. See your Windows
   manual for more information on TrueType fonts.

</PRE>When you click OK, a message similar to the following appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to launch or communicate with server application.

   Publisher is unable to open the application needed to complete this
   task. Your system may be low on memory. Save your work, and close
   any other applications to free up memory, and then try again. If
   you've already done this, the application may not be accessible.
   Press F1 if you want more information.

</PRE>To verify that TrueType fonts are installed and enabled, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the Windows Control Panel, choose Fonts.

<P><LI>Scroll through the Installed Fonts list. TrueType fonts will have
   the word "TrueType" in parentheses following the name of the font.

<P><LI>Select some TrueType fonts and make sure that samples of them
   appear in the Sample area at the bottom of the Fonts window.

<P><LI>Choose the TrueType button.

<P><LI>Make sure the Enable TrueType Fonts check box is selected and choose
   OK.

<P><LI>In the Fonts dialog box, choose Close.
<P>
</OL>To double-check that TrueType fonts are available, try using them in
another Windows application.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If TrueType fonts really are installed and enabled, but WordArt still is
unable to recognize them, you may be experiencing one of the following
problems:

<UL><LI>You may not have a SETUP.INF file in your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.
   If SETUP.INF is missing, correct this problem by copying the SETUP.INF
   file from the Windows Setup disks to your SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>This problem may also occur if the SETUP.INF file in the Window SYSTEM
   subdirectory is too big. If this is the case, the [Language] section
   cannot be read because it is at the end of the file and too close to the
   64K memory limit.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem in Publisher, try any of the following solutions.
<P>

</PRE></OL><h3>Solution 2</h3>
 
<P>
Copy the original SETUP.INF file from the original Windows disks to the
WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory, overwriting the existing setup.inf file.
<P>
<P><h3>Solution 3</h3>
 
<P>
Delete the WordArt 2.0 entry from REGEDIT, then re-register WordArt 2.0.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>

problem was corrected in Publisher version 2.0a.
