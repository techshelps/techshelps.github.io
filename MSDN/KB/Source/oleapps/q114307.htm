The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel, version 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Graph, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups operating system version 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you insert a Microsoft Graph 5.0 Chart object, a Microsoft WordArt
object or an Equation Editor 2.0 object in a Word for Windows document, a
Microsoft Excel worksheet, or a PowerPoint for Windows presentation,
Windows loses available GDI (system) resources. (To display the percentage
of available Windows resources, switch to Windows Program Manager and
choose About Program Manager from the Help menu.)
<P>
If you insert additional Graph 5.0 Chart, WordArt or Equation Editor
objects, Windows continues to lose available system resources. Closing the
file that contains the objects will restore Windows resources.
<P>
After you sufficiently deplete your Windows resources, memory errors may
occur in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, or other Windows-
based applications. Some applications, including Word, may not even start.
<P>
This problem does not occur when you insert Graph 5.0 Chart, WordArt or
Equation Editor objects in the following Microsoft applications:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Publisher

<LI>Microsoft Works

<LI>Windows Write
<P>
</UL>Furthermore, this problem does not occur when you insert objects from
versions of Microsoft Graph earlier than 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Both Microsoft Excel and Word start a separate Graph or WordArt session
each time you insert a new Graph 5.0 Chart or WordArt object in the
document. Each Graph or WordArt object keeps its respective session of
Graph running even after returning to the document. PowerPoint uses only
one Graph session per document regardless of how many Graph objects are
inserted into the presentation. That Graph session remains active even
after returning to the document. If several PowerPoint presentations remain
open for editing, each presentation can have its own session of Graph
running.
<P>
NOTE: The active Graph session in PowerPoint can be replaced by another OLE
edited object such as an embedded Microsoft Excel chart. If the Microsoft
Excel chart is the last OLE object edited in the presentation, then
Microsoft Excel will continue to run in that presentation. PowerPoint
minimizes the loss of system resources by allowing only one active OLE
application at a time per presentation. The accumulation of open Graph,
WordArt, or other OLE object sessions quickly depletes your available
Windows GDI resources.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Method 1: If your Windows system resources are depleted by the multiple
<PRE>          insertion of Graph 5.0 Chart or other OLE objects, save,
          close and reopen the Word document, Microsoft Excel
          worksheet, or PowerPoint presentation. The OLE objects will
          close and release system resources. However, editing the
          objects again will once more leave them running in the
          document.

</PRE>Method 2: Instead of editing the Graph 5.0 Chart or other OLE object in
<PRE>          place (that is, in the Word or Microsoft Excel window), open
          the chart in a separate Graph 5.0 window. To do this, select
          the Graph 5.0 Chart object and choose Edit Chart Object from
          the Edit menu. From the menu that appears, choose Open.

</PRE>Method 3: Do not insert a Graph 5.0 Chart object in your document or
<PRE>          worksheet. Instead, insert a Microsoft Graph 3.0 object or
          Microsoft Excel Chart object.

</PRE>NOTE: Word 6.0 supplies Graph 3.0, which appears as "Microsoft Graph" in
the Object Type list in the Insert Object dialog box. If Microsoft Graph
does not appear in the Object Type list, you can install it using the Word
Setup program.
<P>
If you want to run both Graph 3.0 and 5.0 on your computer, you need to set
the AutoConvert option in Graph 5.0 to "off." To turn off this option,
either run the AUTOCONV.EXE program, located in the Graph 5.0 program
directory, or rerun Setup and choose No when Setup asks whether you want to
enable the AutoConvert option.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Graph 5.0 ships with Microsoft Access version 2.0 and Microsoft
PowerPoint version 4.0. After you install Microsoft Access or PowerPoint,
other Windows-based OLE 2 applications (such as Microsoft Excel or Word)
can use Graph 5.0 as well.
