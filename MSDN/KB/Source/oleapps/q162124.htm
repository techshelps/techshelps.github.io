   TITLE     : CG3: Clip Gallery General Troubleshooting Tips Part 2 of 2

</PRE>If your topic is not covered in this article, query on the article title in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Although you can start with any of the following troubleshooting
techniques, Microsoft recommends that you start at the top of the list and
continue troubleshooting until your problem is resolved or diagnosed.
<P>
<P><h3>Does Clip Gallery Function Correctly in Another Program?</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start WordPad. To do this, click the Start button, point to Programs,
   point to Accessories, and click WordPad.
<P>
   NOTE: You can use any program that has an Insert Object command
   to run the tests. In this article, WordPad was chosen to perform the
   Clip Gallery tests because it comes with Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0.

<P><LI>On the Insert Menu, click Object, and then click Microsoft Clip Gallery.
   Click OK.
<P>
</OL>If Clip Gallery starts from another program, Clip Gallery is functioning
properly. Your troubleshooting steps should now focus on the client program
(the program you are trying to use Clip Gallery with). Please consult your
documentation to troubleshoot the client program.
<P>
If Clip Gallery does not start, proceed to the next section.
<P>
<P><h3>Does Clip Gallery Run from the Compact Disc?</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: If you have Publisher 97 on floppy disks, proceed to the "Test for a
Corrupted Artgalry.cag File" section of this article.

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Publisher 97 or Office 97 compact disc into the CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>Start Windows Explorer and switch to the Shared\Artgalry folder on
   the compact disc. For example, if your CD-ROM drive is drive D, go
   to D:\Shared\Artgalry.

<P><LI>Double-click Artgalry.exe from the compact disc. This registers
   the program as a shared application in the registry of the operating
   system.
<P>
   NOTE: If you receive an error message when you try to register
   Artgalry.exe from the compact disc, you may be experiencing problems
   with the registry or with the compact disc.

<P><LI>Start WordPad. To do this, click the Start button, point to Programs,
   point to Accessories, and click WordPad.

<P><LI>On the Insert Menu, click Object, and then click Microsoft Clip Gallery.
   Click OK.

<P><LI>If Clip Gallery starts from the compact disc, the copy of Artgalry.exe
   on your hard disk may be corrupted.
<P>
   To copy the contents of the Artgalry folder to your hard disk, follow
   these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Copy the contents of the Shared\Artgalry folder (except the
       Artgalry.cag file, which is already on your hard disk), to the
       Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Artgalry folder.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. Double-click the Artgalry.exe file to register the copy on your
       hard disk.
</PRE>
<P><LI>To see if Clip Gallery now runs from your hard disk, follow these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories,
       and click WordPad.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. On the Insert Menu, click Object, and then click Microsoft Clip
       Gallery. Click OK.
</PRE><P>
</OL>If Clip Gallery does not run, proceed to the next section.
<P>
<P><h3>Test for a Corrupted Artgalry.cag File</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Rename the Artgalry.cag file. To do so:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Find the Artgalry.cag file. This file is usually located in the
       Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Artgalry folder.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. Right-click the file icon, click Rename on the shortcut menu, and
       then enter a new name, such as Artgalry.old.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Try starting Clip Gallery again. To do so:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Start WordPad. To do this, click the Start button, point to
       Programs, point to Accessories, and click WordPad.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. On the Insert menu, click Object.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. In the Object Type list, click Microsoft Clip Gallery, and then
       click OK.
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If the Artgalry.cag file is missing, Clip Gallery creates a new
   one when you start Clip Gallery. Artgalry.cag is a database file
   that stores the clip preview images and catalogs the location of each
   image. Clips you may have manually added to Clip Gallery from other
   sources are now unavailable. However, this does not remove clipart
   from Office 97, PowerPoint 97, or Publisher 97, because these programs
   use concurrent databases and are not affected if you delete the
   Artgalry.cag file.
<P>
   For more information on creating a custom Artgalry.cag, please see
   the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<P>
<P><h3>Check the Registry Entries for Clip Gallery</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
If you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair
Disk (ERD).
<P>
NOTE: The following steps assume you are running Windows 95 or Windows NT
4.0. (If you are running Windows NT 3.51, substitute regedt32.exe in step
1.)

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. Type "regedit" (without the quotation
   marks) in the Open box, and then click Open. This starts the Registry
   Editor.

      ----        ----
      (Default)   "C:\PROGRA~1\COMMON~1\MICROS~1\ARTGALRY\ARTGALRY.EXE"

   The Data value should be the path to your Artgalry.exe file.

   NOTE: The path uses MS-DOS names. This is why you are seeing
   PROGRA~1 instead of the long name: Program Files.

</PRE><P><LI>Locate the following registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      My Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\
      {00021290-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\LocalServer32

compare with the dates in the table.
<P>
If any of the files do not have appropriate dates for your operating system

because of mismatched DLL files.
<P>
Follow these steps to replace your OLE32 files:

<OL><P><LI>Restore the DLLs from the Sysbckup folder (Windows 95 only).
<P>
   Some of the OLE32 files can be restored from the Sysbckup folder.
   This must be done in MS-DOS mode because Windows may be using some
   of the files for other operations.
<P>
   NOTE: The system backup (Sysbckup) folder is located in the folder
   in which you installed Windows 95. (Windows NT does not have a
   Sysbckup folder.)
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Click Start, and then click Shut Down. This opens the Shut Down
       Windows dialog box.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. On the Shut Down Windows dialog box, click "Restart the computer in
       MS-DOS mode?" to restart your computer in MS-DOS mode.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. Switch to the Windows\Sysbckup folder and type the following
       command:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          COPY *.DLL C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\*.DLL

       This copies the DLL file in the Windows\Sysbckup folder to the
       Windows\System folder. This may contain the mismatched DLLs that are
       causing the problem.

    d. After you copy the files, restart your computer, and let Windows 95
       start normally.

    e. Test to see if Clip Gallery starts within WordPad.

       Start WordPad from the Start menu and start Microsoft Clip
       Gallery from the Insert menu.

       If Clip Gallery does not start, then the replacement files did
       not fix the problem. You must rename the DLL files and either
       manually extract the files from your original installation source
       or reinstall Windows 95.

</PRE><P><LI>Extract the OLE32 DLL files from your Windows compact disc.
<P>
   WARNING: The following procedure involves manually replacing
   DLLs. If you are not experienced with manual extraction
   procedures or have an OEM installation of Windows 95, you may want to
   simply reinstall Windows 95. Incorrectly replacing OLE modules can
   result in more problems than it resolves. If you are unsure of the
   following steps, please contact Windows 95 Technical Support or
   the OEM Manufacturer that pre-installed your operating system.
<P>
   Extract the files into the Windows\System folder, replacing every file
   in the OLE32 file table.

   95 .cab files, please see the following articles in the Microsoft

    a. After you copy the files, restart your computer, and let Windows
       95 start normally.

    b. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then
       click WordPad.

    c. On the Insert menu, click Object.

    d. In the Object Type list, click Microsoft Clip Gallery, and then
       click OK.

</PRE></OL>If Clip Gallery still does not start, then the problem is most likely with
the operating system. This might require that you reinstall Windows 95 or
you may have to reformat your hard disk and reinstall all of your programs.
At this point, Microsoft recommends that you contact Windows Technical
Support or the OEM Manufacturer that pre-installed Windows on the computer.
