The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.0, 4.2, 4.3
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Works for Windows, version 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Access for Windows, version 2.0
<LI>Microsoft Publisher for Windows, version 2.0
<LI>Microsoft StyleLine Design Pack
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you have both the Compaq utilities in Compaq OEM Windows version 3.1,
and you have one or more of the applications above installed on your
computer, one of the following symptoms occurs:

<UL><LI>You receive a general protection (GP) fault when you use the Compaq
   Windows utilities.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You cannot run a Microsoft Windows OLE version 2.0 application.
<P>
</UL>You may then receive the error message:

<UL><LI>Not enough memory to run Microsoft Word.
<P>
</UL>When you attempt to start PowerPoint, you do not receive the error
messages. The application fails to start and you will not see the splash
screen. You are then returned to the Windows Program Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because the Microsoft applications listed above
use a file, STORAGE.DLL, and the Compaq system utilities also use a
file named STORAGE.DLL. The Compaq STORAGE.DLL file is located in the
CPQWIN subdirectory of the Windows directory. The Microsoft Windows
STORAGE.DLL file is located in the SYSTEM subdirectory of the Windows
directory. Because only one STORAGE.DLL file at a time can be loaded
in your computer's memory, a conflict occurs when an application tries
to use the wrong version of this file.
<P>
If you run one of the applications listed above first, (after
starting Microsoft Windows, and before running one of the Compaq
system utilities) you receive a GP fault when you then try to run one
of the Compaq system utilities. On the other hand, if you run one of
the Compaq system utilities first, (after starting Microsoft Windows,
and before running one of the applications listed above) you cannot
start one of the applications listed above.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid these problems, exit Microsoft Windows between running an OLE 2.0
application and one of the Compaq system utilities (you cannot run an OLE
2.0 application and a Compaq system utility in the same Microsoft Windows
session).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
STORAGE.DLL is an object linking and embedding (OLE) 2.0 dynamic link
library file that is used by applications that support OLE version 2.0 to
provide a more abstract view of OLE files. The STORAGE.DLL file allows a
document file to be viewed as if it were an entire file system, complete
with subdirectories and files that can be copied, deleted, and moved,
instead of as a flat stream of bytes on the disk. This structure is
necessary to provide a location for OLE objects (each requires its own
subdirectory inside a file), and also to provide compatibility between
applications. For example, a file preview is saved in a particular "file"
inside a document file, so that any application that uses STORAGE.DLL can
locate and use it for previews in the OpenFile or FindFile dialog boxes.
<P>
If you run Compaq Windows with Tabworks by Xerox, you may get the error:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not load STORAGE.DLL

</PRE>Compaq system utilities and Tabworks are manufactured by a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
