   TITLE     : CG3: Clip Gallery General Troubleshooting Tips Part 1 of 2

</PRE>If your topic is not covered in this article, query on the article title in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Clip Gallery Cannot Open Previews File</h3>
 
<P>
You may receive the following error message when a Clip Gallery database
(.cag) file has been moved, deleted, or is no longer accessible:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot Open Previews File

   Clip Gallery cannot open the previews file C:\Art Files
   \Clip Art\My Art.cag

   That file may have been deleted or moved. If you moved that file
   choose Import Clips, then select the file at its new location.
   This will re-import the clips in that previews file.

</PRE>NOTE: The dialog box contains a "Don't attempt to open that file in the
future" check box. If you click to select the check box and then click OK,
that database and its associated thumbnail clips images are permanently
removed from the Clip Gallery. The associated picture file is not deleted
because the .cag file contains a pointer to the file and not the actual
picture itself.
<P>
Clip Gallery may be unable to open the previews file for any of the
following reasons:

<UL><LI>The .cag file has been moved or is missing.
<LI>The .cag file is corrupted.
<LI>There is a problem with the operating system.
<P>
</UL>If the following troubleshooting steps do not fix the problem, you may be
experiencing problems with your computer hardware or operating system.
<P>
<P>
The .cag File Has Been Moved or Is Missing:
<P>
Use the following steps to determine if the .cag file is missing:

<OL><P><LI>Look for the .cag file on your computer. Use the Find feature
    to search for the .cag file. To do this:
<P>
     a. Click the Start button, point to Find, and then Click Files Or
<PRE>        Folders to open the Find All Files dialog box.

     b. In the Named box, type the name of the missing .cag file.

     c. Click Find Now to start the search.

</PRE><P><LI>If you have located the .cag file, verify if its associated image files
    are in the same folder with it. If they are, proceed to step 5.
<P>
    If the .cag file is not present on the hard disk, and it is one that
    you created, you must recreate it. If it is not one that you created,
    proceed to step 3.
<P>
    For additional information on recreating .cag files, please see the
    following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
       ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../OLEAPPS/Q161718.htm">Q161718</A></B>
<PRE>       TITLE     : CG3: Creating Clip Gallery Packages

</PRE><P><LI>Copy the .cag file from the compact disc to the appropriate ClipArt
    folder. This might be
<P>
       C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Artgalry\My Art\
<P>
    if the file came from Publisher 97 or from another Microsoft program.

<P><LI>Check to see if images from the .cag file can be opened in WordPad.
<P>
     a. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories,
<PRE>        and click WordPad.

     b. On the Insert Menu, click Object, and then click Microsoft Clip
        Gallery. Click OK.

    If you do not receive an error message, and Clip Gallery opens
    normally, confirm whether the images from that .cag file can be opened
    in WordPad. If they cannot be opened, see the "Clip Gallery Cannot
    Find A Clip File" section later in this article.

</PRE><P><LI>If the .cag file and its associated image files are in the same
    location, and that location is not where they were originally
    installed, you can either link to the new location or you can move the
    files to the original location. After you link to the files or move
    them, follow steps 3 and 4 in this ("Clip Gallery Cannot Open Previews
    File") section as needed. Otherwise, continue with step 6.

<P><LI>To link to the new location start Publisher, click Clip Art on the
    Insert menu.

<P><LI>The "Clip Gallery cannot open the Previews file" dialog box is
    displayed once for each missing .cag file.
<P>
    Click to select the "Don't attempt to open that file in the future"
    check box and click OK.

<P><LI>Click Import Clips.

<P><LI>In the Look In list, click the location of the .cag file and its
    associated image files. Change the file type to Clip Gallery Packages.

<P><LI>Click the .cag file that is listed. Click Open. When you are
    prompted to restart Clip Gallery, click OK. If you want to link to
    other .cag files, repeat steps 9 and 10 as needed.

<P><LI>After you have linked all the .cag files, close Clip Gallery and
    restart it. Your images should now be available.
<P>
<P>
</OL>The .cag File Is Corrupted:
<P>
If the .cag file is not missing, and is in the correct location, it may be
corrupted.

<OL><P><LI>Locate the .cag file referenced in the error message.

<P><LI>After you find the .cag file, rename it.

<P><LI>If the .cag file came from Publisher 97, Office 97, or PowerPoint 97,
   copy the original .cag file from the ClipArt folder on the compact disc
   to the folder where the renamed file is located.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and
   click WordPad.

<P><LI>On the Insert Menu, click Object, and then click Microsoft Clip
   Gallery. Click OK.
<P>
   If the problem was a corrupted .cag file, Clip Gallery will start
   successfully.
<P>
   However, if the .cag file in question is supposed to be on the compact
   disc, you may be experiencing a problem with your CD-ROM drive, or the
   compact disc may be dirty or damaged.
<P>
   To check for physical damage to the compact disc, follow these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Remove the compact disc from the CD-ROM drive and check the bottom
       of the disc for defects or scratches.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. If it is smudged or dirty, clean with a soft, lint-free cloth.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. After you have cleaned the compact disc, put it back in the CD-ROM
       drive and try to run Clip Gallery again. If it runs successfully,
       then the compact disc was merely dirty.
</PRE><P>
</OL>If you still are experiencing problems with Clip Gallery, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : CG3: Clip Gallery General Troubleshooting Tips Part 1 of 2

</PRE></OL>For additional information, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : CG: How to Manually Merge .cag Files in ClipArt Gallery 2.0/3.0

</PRE><h3>Clip Gallery Cannot Find a Clip File</h3>
 
<P>
If you choose a preview image in Clip Gallery you receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot Find "&lt;path&gt;\&lt;Clip filename&gt;"

</PRE>When you click OK, you receive the following dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot Insert Picture

   The Clip Gallery cannot find this clip file on your disk. If you've
   deleted this file and you want to remove its preview from the Clip
   Gallery, choose Remove Preview.

   If you've deleted or moved many clip files from your disk, choose
   Update All to have Clip Gallery remove or update the previews of all
   missing files.

</PRE>If you click Remove Preview, Clip Gallery simply removes the preview image
from its CAG database. If you click Update All, you receive the following
dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   Update

   Click Update All to correct previews for previews for clip files that
   have been deleted, moved, or changed.

   To add previews of other clip files to the Clip Gallery, click Cancel,
   and then click Import Clips.

</PRE>This dialog box has an "Also correct previews on" check box for Network
drives and another check box for Removable disks.
<P>
If you click Cancel, you are then returned to Clip Gallery.
<P>
If you click Update All, follow the instructions on the screen to locate
the missing images. If you do not click to select the check box for either
Network drives or Removable disks, Clip Gallery will not check the clip
files on either location.
<P>
<P><h3>Can't Open Log File</h3>
 
<P>
When you choose to import in a clip file in the Computer Graphics Metafile
(CGM) format, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't open log file

</PRE>If you click OK, the image is still imported.
<P>
You will receive this error message in only two situations:
<P>
<PRE>   The cgmerrs.log file is set to read-only.

   -or-

   The cgmerrs.log file is corrupted.

</PRE>If the cgmerrs.log file is not marked as read only, then delete the file;
the CGM import filter will create a new one.
<P>
This file, although not a critical one, is used by the CGM import filter to
track errors that occur during a file import. This means that you must be
able to write to the Cgmerrs.log file. The default location is the same
folder as the Cgmimp32.flt file. If the file is on a network server in a
shared folder, the \Msapps\Grphflt folder must have the read/write property
set for all users who install Clip Gallery.
<P>
<P><h3>Unable to View Clipart in Clip Gallery</h3>
