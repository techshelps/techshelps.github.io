The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Equation Editor version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using version 3.0 of Microsoft Windows and the Microsoft
Equation Editor, the fonts included with the Equation Editor, which
ship with version 2.0 of Microsoft Word for Windows, are designed to
work exclusively with PCL and PostScript printers. A set of screen
fonts is also supplied; however, these are for display purposes only.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Equation Editor fonts do not work with non-PCL or non-PostScript
printers. Equation Editor does substitute other fonts for such
printers; however, this substitution usually creates undesirable
output because the Equation Editor fonts consist of special characters
(such as braces, integrals, and summation symbols). The printers most
affected by this problem are dot-matrix printers and Hewlett-Packard
(HP) DeskJet printers.
<P>
You may be able to get some of the Equation Editor characters to print
by using the Style command on the Define menu to reassign fonts.
Typically, the U.C. Greek, L.C. Greek, and Symbol styles need to
be redefined.
<P>
A better solution is to use a font manager that recognizes PostScript
Type 1 fonts. PostScript Type 1 fonts for the Equation Editor ship
with Word for Windows; therefore, you can install these fonts in a
font manager that recognizes this format (for example, Adobe Type
Manager or Superprint).
<P>
If Windows version 3.1 is installed on the system, the best method is
to use TrueType for the Equation Editor fonts. TrueType fonts work on
any printer whose driver is compatible with Windows 3.1. If Word for
Windows was installed prior to Windows 3.1, it may be necessary to
re-install the Equation Editor. Reinstallation places the TrueType
versions of the Fences and MTExtra fonts on the system. Use the
following procedure to reinstall the Equation Editor:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Word for Windows Setup program. To do this, double-click
   the Word Setup icon, or run Setup with the File Run command in Program
   Manager.

<P><LI>Proceed through Setup normally until you are prompted to choose
   Complete, Custom, or Minimum Installation. Choose the Custom option.

<P><LI>Clear all the check boxes in the Word Setup Options dialog box
   except the Draw, Graph, Equation Editor, WordArt check box. Choose the
   Tools button.

<P><LI>Clear the check boxes for Draw, Graph, and WordArt. Verify that the
   Equation Editor check box is selected, then choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Choose the Setup button.
