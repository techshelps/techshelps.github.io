The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Organization Chart, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Organization Chart can be run from within another application
that supports OLE, or it can be run as a stand alone application. The
information in this article discusses where Microsoft Organization Chart
files are stored, it suggests troubleshooting techniques you can use if
Microsoft Organization Chart does not work the way you expect, and it also
describes how you can save Microsoft Organization Chart files for later
use.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Where Microsoft Organization Chart Files Are Stored</h3>
 
<P>
The three files used to run Microsoft Organization Chart are the following:
<P>
<PRE>    MS Organization Chart 1.0          Program executable
    MS Organization Chart 1.0 Help     Help files
    MSOrgChart Template                Default template

</PRE>These files are located in the Microsoft folder on your hard disk drive.
<P>
Microsoft Organization Chart also uses the MSOrgChart Preferences and
MSOrgChart Clipboard files, which are located in the Preferences folder in
the System Folder. The preferences files contain information about the
settings Microsoft Organization Chart uses; this information includes any
custom settings you specify. When you run Microsoft Organization Chart, the
program looks for these files in the Preferences folder. Note that
preferences files are created when you run the program (they are not
installed during Setup).
<P>
<P><h3>If Microsoft Organization Chart Does Not Behave As Expected</h3>
 
<P>
If you experience unexpected behavior in Microsoft Organization Chart,
start the Office Setup program, and try reinstalling the application.
<P>
If this doesn't work, the problem may be caused by a setting in one of the
preferences files. To reset the preferences files, drag MSOrgChart
Preferences and MSOrgChart Clipboard to the trash and choose Empty Trash
from the Special menu. The next time you run Microsoft Organization Chart,
new files with the standard default settings will be generated.
<P>
NOTE: Because preference files are created when you start the program, you
cannot remove them with the Add/Remove Setup feature. Note also that these
files are not text files, so they cannot be edited with a text editor.
<P>
<P><h3>Saving and Using Microsoft Organization Chart Files</h3>
 
<P>
Organization Charts can be saved as files to be used later. When you save a
file from Microsoft Organization Chart, the type is FOPX and the creator is
MORG.
<P>
To save a file from Microsoft Organization Chart:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save As (or choose Save A Copy As if you are
   using Microsoft Organization Chart from within another application).

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, specify a location for your file, and in the
   Save Chart As box, type a filename, and click Save.
<P>
</OL>To insert a previously saved Organization Chart in an Office application:

<OL><P><LI>Start the application.

<P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Object.

<P><LI>In the Insert Object Dialog Box, choose Organization Chart,
   click the From File box, and then type in the filename or browse
   for the file. Click OK.
<P></OL>
