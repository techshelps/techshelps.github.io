The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 3.x, 4.x, 5.x, 6.0, 6.2,
   6.21, 6.22
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft MS-DOS assigns drive letters to the first two physical
floppy disk drives and hard disk drives it finds at boot time in a
fixed sequence, including multiple partitions and logical drives on
the hard disks. You cannot change this sequence.
<P>
The drive letters assigned to additional drives installed using
DRIVER.SYS and other installable device drivers is dependent upon the
order in which the drivers are loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file. These
drive letter assignments can be influenced by changing the order of
the CONFIG.SYS statements or loading "dummy" drives to "use up" drive
letters.
<P>
Drive letter assignments can change when you upgrade from one Microsoft
MS-DOS version to another or from an original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
version of MS-DOS to another version that assigns drive letters
differently. (The order in which drive letters are assigned was modified by
OEMs in earlier versions of MS-DOS.) This article describes how MS-DOS
assigns drive letters; it does not explain how particular OEM MS-DOS
versions assign drive letters.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following occurs at startup:

<OL><P><LI>MS-DOS checks all installed disk devices, assigning the drive letter
   A to the first physical floppy disk drive that is found.

<P><LI>If a second physical floppy disk drive is present, it is assigned
   drive letter B. If it is not present, a logical drive B is created
   that uses the first physical floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>Regardless of whether a second floppy disk drive is present, MS-DOS
   then assigns the drive letter C to the primary MS-DOS partition on
   the first physical hard disk, and then goes on to check for a
   second hard disk.

<P><LI>If a second physical hard disk is found, and a primary partition
   exists on the second physical drive, the primary MS-DOS partition
   on the second physical hard drive is assigned the letter D.
<P>
   MS-DOS version 5.0, which supports up to eight physical drives,
   will continue to search for more physical hard disk drives at this
   point. For example, if a third physical hard disk is found, and a
   primary partition exists on the third physical drive, the primary
   MS-DOS partition on the third physical hard drive is assigned the
   letter E.

<P><LI>MS-DOS returns to the first physical hard disk drive and assigns drive
   letters to any additional logical drives (in extended MS-DOS partitions)
   on that drive in sequence.

<P><LI>MS-DOS repeats this process for the second physical hard disk drive, if
   present.
<P>
   MS-DOS 5.0 will repeat this process for up to eight physical hard
   drives, if present.
<P>
   After all logical drives (in extended MS-DOS partitions) have been
   assigned drive letters, MS-DOS 5.0 returns to the first physical
   drive and assigns drive letters to any other primary MS-DOS
   partitions that exist, then searches other physical drives for
   additional primary MS-DOS partitions. This support for multiple
   primary MS-DOS partitions was added to version 5.0 for backward
   compatibility with the previous OEM MS-DOS versions that support
   multiple primary partitions.

<P><LI>After all logical drives on the hard disk(s) have been assigned
   drive letters, drive letters are assigned to drives installed using
   DRIVER.SYS or created using RAMDRIVE.SYS in the order in which the
   drivers are loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file.  Which drive letters are
   assigned to which devices can be influenced by changing the order
   of the device drivers or, if necessary, by creating "dummy" drive
   letters with DRIVER.SYS.
<P>
</OL>The MS-DOS utility SUBST, networks and programs such as the CD-ROM
Extensions which use the MS-DOS network interface can request a
specific drive letter be assigned to a block device.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 1</h3>
 
<P>
Consider as an example a system with one floppy disk drive and one
hard disk drive, with two MS-DOS partitions (a primary partition and
an extended partition containing a single logical drive) on the hard
disk. In this configuration, MS-DOS will assign the floppy disk drive
as drives A and B, the primary partition on the hard disk drive as
drive C, and the logical drive in the extended partition as drive D.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 2</h3>
 
<P>
Consider another system with three floppy disk drives, the third drive
being installed using DRIVER.SYS, and two hard disk drives, with a
primary and an extended partition on each hard disk drive. The
extended partition on the first hard disk drive contains two logical
drives, and the extended MS-DOS partition on the second hard disk
drive contains one logical drive. A RAM disk is also created using
RAMDRIVE.SYS.
<P>
In this configuration, MS-DOS will assign the first two floppy disk
drives as drives A and B, then assign the primary partitions on the
first and second physical hard disk drives as drives C and D,
respectively. MS-DOS will then assign the drive letters E and F to the
two logical drives in the extended partition on the first physical
drive, and G to the logical drive in the extended partition on the
second physical drive.
<P>
The third floppy disk drive, installed using DRIVER.SYS, and the RAM
disk created using RAMDRIVE.SYS, will be assigned the letters H and I
in the order in which the DEVICE= statements appear in the CONFIG.SYS
file.
<P>
<P><h3>Partitioning Schemes</h3>
 
<P>
Listed below are some sample partitioning schemes for two 40-megabyte (MB)
hard disk drives and their resulting drive letter assignments:

<UL><LI>Drive 1:
   C: 20 MB primary MS-DOS partition
   E: 20 MB logical drive 1 in extended MS-DOS partition
<P>
   Drive 2:
   D: 20 MB primary MS-DOS partition
   F: 20 MB logical drive 1 in extended MS-DOS partition

<LI>Drive 1:
   C: 20 MB primary MS-DOS partition
   D: 20 MB logical drive 1 in extended MS-DOS partition
<P>
   Drive 2:
   E: 20 MB logical drive 1 in extended MS-DOS partition
   F: 20 MB logical drive 2 in extended MS-DOS partition

<LI>Drive 1:
   C: 10 MB primary MS-DOS partition
   E: 10 MB logical drive 1 in extended MS-DOS partition
   F: 10 MB logical drive 2 in extended MS-DOS partition
   G: 10 MB logical drive 3 in extended MS-DOS partition
<P>
   Drive 2:
   D: 10 MB primary MS-DOS partition
   H: 10 MB logical drive 1 in extended MS-DOS partition
   I: 10 MB logical drive 2 in extended MS-DOS partition
   J: 10 MB logical drive 3 in extended MS-DOS partition
