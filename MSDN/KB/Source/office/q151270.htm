<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run an administrative network installation of Microsoft Office
(setup /a) on a Personal Netware server, the installation fails at the
end with the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot change properties of the file named : R:\msoffice\setup.ini.
   It is in use by another application.

</PRE>Your choices are retry or cancel.
<P>
The same installation on the Netware server will finish successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup.ini file is a read-only file stored on the installation disk.
During installation the file is copied to the server's hard disk as a
read-only file. Office opens and closes this file many times
during the installation process. In all cases, except for the very end of
the installation, the file is opened as (Deny Write, Read). At the very end
of the installation, the file is opened with desired access of (Deny Write,
Deny Read, Write). These access rights are being expressed as NCP
equivalent to the MS-DOS call being made. At this point, the Personal
Netware server is returning a reply of Lock fail.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Install the administration copy to a substituted drive letter on the Server
without the network loaded. When asked for a server name enter the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   \\SERVER_NAME\VOLUME_NAME

</PRE>If you want the Server computer to be a client also, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Restart the computer, and this time load the network.

<P><LI>Map the same drive letter that had been previously substituted.

<P><LI>From Windows, run Setup.exe from the MSOFFICE subdirectory on the
   mapped drive.

<P><LI>Do a workstation installation.
<P>
</OL>Repeat these 4 steps for each client computer.
