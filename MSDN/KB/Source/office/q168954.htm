article explains how to find information concerning these offers on
Microsoft's Web site.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>

Providers (ISPs) in both the United States and Canada. If you are a
licensed user of the Office 97 SBE, you are eligible to receive 60 days of
free site hosting from one of these ISPs.

To find information concerning this offer, make sure that you are connected
to the Internet, either through an online service, an ISP, or through your
company's connection to the Internet. Then, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Office 97 SBE Compact Disc 1 into your computer's
   CD-ROM drive.

   NOTE: If the screen does not appear, double-click Autorun.exe in the
</OL>root
