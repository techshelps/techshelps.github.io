<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert an object created by one of the Microsoft Office
applications listed above in a Lotus Notes form, the object fields are not
updated with the Lotus Notes field information, and vice versa.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you are running Lotus Notes from a Banyan Vines
network server, and the Office application that you used to create the
object that you inserted in the form (server application) is running. For
example, if you are running Lotus Notes on a Banyan Vines server, when you
insert a Microsoft Word document object in a Lotus Notes form while
Microsoft Word is running, the document object fields are not exchanged
with the fields in the form.
<P>
This behavior occurs because when you run Lotus Notes from a server instead
of from a Workstation installation, the .dll files necessary for using
Lotus Notes Field Exchange are not in the path on your computer. Office
looks for the following .dll files to exchange data with Lotus Notes:
_Sdk.dll, _Nsf.dll, and _Lib.dll.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem when you are running Lotus Notes from a Banyan
Vines server, use any of the following methods:
<P>
Method 1: Close the Microsoft Office application that you used to insert
<PRE>          the object in the Notes form.

</PRE>Method 2: Copy the necessary .dll files (_Sdk.dll, _Nsf.dll, and _Lib.dll)
<PRE>          from the Lotus Notes installation on the Banyan Vines server to a
          directory in your path statement, such as the System directory in
          your Microsoft Windows directory.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
