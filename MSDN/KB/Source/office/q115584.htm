<UL><LI>Microsoft Office Assistant for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have previously completed a workstation installation of the
Microsoft Office applications, you receive an error message either
when you run the Microsoft Office Assistant Setup program, or when
you edit one of the Microsoft Office Assistant files. The error
message you receive varies depending on the network software that you
are using. The following is a list of possible error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Directory is read-only
   Cannot create directory
   Cannot save or create file
   Cannot save or write to file
   Could not open the file named...

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office Assistant Setup program, the Microsoft
Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft Access components may be
installed to the network server program directories. You may receive copy
errors when the files are copied to the network server, or you may receive
errors when you attempt to save changes to Microsoft Office Assistant files
on the network server.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving these error messages, do the following to change the
directory to which the component files are installed when you run the
Microsoft Office Assistant Setup program:

<OL><P><LI>Disconnect from the network server that contains the installations of
   the Microsoft Office applications that you are running.

<P><LI>Run the Microsoft Office Assistant Setup program. The majority of the
   Microsoft Office Assistant files are copied to the OFFASST directory on
   the hard drive of your computer without the subdirectory structure.
<P>
   Setup tells you that all Office applicationss were not installed, or
   not installed correctly. Choose Continue.
<P>
   If you chose Express, you will receive the error "Microsoft Office
   Assistant Setup was not completed sucessfully."

<P><LI>Connect again to the network drive that contains the Microsoft Office
   applications that you are running.

<P><LI>Copy the *.BMP files that are located in the MSBTTNS directory on your
   hard drive, such as C:\MSBTTNS, to the \MSOFFICE\MSBTTNS subdirectory on
   the network.

<P><LI>Use the Microsoft Office button on the Microsoft Office Manager (MOM)
   toolbar to customize the Microsoft Office Assistant Button Image to the
   OABTN.BMP. You only need to complete this step for the first
   workstation.
<P>
</OL>When you run Microsoft Office Assistant and click on a document or template
filename to open the file, you are prompted to locate the corresponding
applications executable (*.EXE) file. The selected directory in the Locate
dialog box should be the correct directory. Select the applications *.EXE
file from the File Name list, and choose OK to open the selected document
or template.
<P>
NOTE: Because a number of the document files are copied directly into the
OFFASST directory when you use this workaround, the files on the hard drive
are not in the same location as listed in Microsoft Office Assistant.
<P>
Microsoft does not guarantee that this workaround will function correctly
in all situations, but it should allow you basic functionality of the
Office Assistant components.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that this behavior will not affect the Microsoft Word components or
the compound documents installed with the Microsoft Office Assistant,
because these files are installed to your user directory when you are
running a workstation installation of the Microsoft Office applications.
<P>
The Microsoft Office Assistant attempts to install the components in the
following directories (where C: designates your user directory or local
hard disk drive and S: designates the server drive):
<P>
<PRE>   Component                             Directory
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
    Microsoft Word Templates             C:\WINWORD\TEMPLATES

    Microsoft Excel Templates            S:\MSOFFICE

    Microsoft PowerPoint Templates       S:\MSOFFICE\*
                                         * Appropriate PowerPoint
                                         template directory

    Microsoft Access Databases           S:\MSOFFICE\SAMPAPPS

    Compound Documents                   C:\OFFASST

    Microsoft Font Assistant and Fonts   Windows directory
