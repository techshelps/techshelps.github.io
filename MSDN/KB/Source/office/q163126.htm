The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install an upgrade version of Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft
Excel 97, the Setup program does not recognize the following compact discs
as valid qualifying products when you select them in the Locate Directory
dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>                                May not recognize
   This Setup program           these compact discs
   ----------------------------------------------------------

   Microsoft Office 97          Corel Office Professional 7
   Microsoft Excel 97           Corel WordPerfect Suite 7
   Microsoft Excel 97           Corel Office Professional 7

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Excel 97
Setup programs do not recognize any of the files that are located in the
root folders of the Corel WordPerfect Suite 7 and Corel Office Professional
7 compact discs.
<P>
For example, if you select "D:\" in the Locate Directory dialog box, where
D: is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive, the Setup program may not allow
you to continue.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In order for the Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft Excel 97 Setup program to
properly recognize either Corel compact disc as a qualifying upgrade
product, you may need to point the Setup program to a different folder on
the compact disc. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>When the Locate Directory dialog box is displayed, remove the Microsoft
   Office 97 or Microsoft Excel 97 compact disc from the CD-ROM drive.
   Then, insert the appropriate Corel compact disc in its place.
<P>
   NOTE: When you do this, you may receive an error message in a blue
   screen. If this occurs, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../OFFICE/Q163125.htm">Q163125</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : OFF97: "Error Reading CD-ROM"/Blue Screen During Setup

</PRE><P><LI>In the Locate Directory dialog box, select the CD-ROM drive in the
   Drives list (for example, D:).

<P><LI>In the Directories list box, switch to the following folder on the
   compact disc:
<P>
<P><PRE>      D:\Corel\Office7\Quattro7
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>When the Microsoft Office 97 Setup dialog box is displayed, remove the
   Corel compact disc, and place the Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft
   Excel 97 compact disc in the CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>Continue through the remainder of the Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft
   Excel 97 Setup program.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for an upgrade version of Microsoft Office
97 or Microsoft Excel 97, the Setup program is designed to look for certain
files with specific file sizes to determine whether you are eligible to
install the upgrade. The Setup program looks for files in the following
locations:

<UL><LI>On your computer's hard disk
<LI>On a qualifying product's floppy disk
<LI>On a qualifying product's compact disc
<P>
</UL>The problem described in the "Summary" section occurs because the Microsoft
Office 97 and Microsoft Excel 97 Setup programs do not recognize any of the
files in the root folder of the Corel Office Professional 7 compact disc.
Also, the Microsoft Excel 97 Setup program does not recognize any of the
files in the root folder of the Corel WordPerfect Suite 7 compact disc.
Both of these compact discs include Quattro Pro 7, which is a valid upgrade
product for both Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
If the problem occurs, use the steps shown in the "Workaround" section to
allow the Setup program to proceed.
<P>
Corel WordPerfect Suite 7, Corel Office Professional 7, and Quattro Pro 7
are manufactured by Corel Corporation, a vendor independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
