<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office, the amount of disk space that the Setup
program requests may be different from the amount that is documented on the
Microsoft Office package, and different from the amount the application
actually uses.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs for a number of reasons. The following are causes for
Microsoft Office or the Microsoft Office Setup program to use more disk
space than expected:
<P>
<P><h3>GID Files</h3>
 
<P>
The Office Setup program installs one .gid file for each Help file that is
installed. The .gid file is a 0-byte file that increases in size when you
run Help for the first time and set up the Help file. The size of the .gid
file may increase to as much as one-third the size of the Help file itself.
<P>
NOTE: In Microsoft Office 97, .gid files are not copied to your computer by
the Setup program. However, when you run Help for the first time, a .gid
file will be created for each Help file you open.
<P>
<P><h3>FTS Files</h3>
 
<P>
When you run Help, if you click the Index button, the Help file is indexed,
and a Full Text Search (.fts) file is created. This file may be larger than
the Help file itself.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows Swap File</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows swap file grows considerably during Office Setup, as
well as during regular use of Microsoft Windows. This means that you will
actually need more disk space than the documented requirements to run
Microsoft Office and the Setup program. However, this is by design of
Microsoft Windows, and this behavior affects all of the applications that
you run under Windows, not just Microsoft Office.
<P>
The size of the swap file depends on the amount of available memory on your
computer. In general, the size of your swap file plus the amount of
available memory on your computer equal approximately 18 megabytes (MB).
Note that the minimum memory required in Windows is 14 MB.
<P>
This also means that if you check the amount of free disk space before and
after running Office Setup, the difference between these two values will be
greater than the amount of disk space required for the Office installation
option that you chose.
<P>
<P><h3>Registry</h3>
 
<P>
The size of the registry file in Windows (the hidden files User.dat and
System.dat) may also grow considerably after using Microsoft Office.
<P>
<P><h3>Setup from Administrative Install</h3>
 
<P>
When you run Setup from an administrative installation of Microsoft Office
7.0 on a network server, the disk space used for the files copied to the
Common Files folder may vary from 2.5 MB (Compact) to 5.4 MB (Typical) to
18.6 MB (Custom w/Select All or Workstation with shared
applications installed to local hard disk).
