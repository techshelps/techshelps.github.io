The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a workbook in Microsoft Excel 97, some formulas in the
workbook may not be recalculated properly. For example, if cell B5 in
Sheet2 contains the following formula
<P>
<PRE>   =Sheet1!A1

</PRE>the formula may return a value that was previously in Sheet1!A1 instead of
the value that is currently in Sheet1!A1.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occur if all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>In Microsoft Access 97, you create a link table that links to a
   worksheet in a Microsoft Excel workbook.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>By using Microsoft Access 97, you change a value (or values) in the link
   table.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You open the workbook in Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>One or more formulas in the workbook refer to the changed values.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel 97, open the workbook.

<P><LI>Press CTRL+ALT+F9.
<P>
</OL>The values in the workbook are recalculated. If you make additional changes
to the workbook in Microsoft Excel 97, Microsoft Excel continues to
recalculate the values properly. If you use Microsoft Access 97 to make
additional changes to the workbook, you must use the workaround when you
reopen the workbook in Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 97. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when a workbook must be recalculated, a record named
"RTUNCALCED" is written in the workbook. Microsoft Excel clears this record
when the workbook is recalculated; if the record is not present, Microsoft
Excel 97 does not recalculate the values in workbook.
<P>
When you make a change to a link table in Microsoft Access 97, the change
is written to the table in the external file. However, if the external file
is a Microsoft Excel workbook, Microsoft Access 97 does not write the
RTUNCALCED record in the workbook. As a result, when you open the workbook
in Microsoft Excel 97, the workbook is not automatically recalculated, and
formulas in the workbook may return incorrect values.
<P>
Note that this problem does not occur when you change a link table in
earlier versions of Microsoft Access.
