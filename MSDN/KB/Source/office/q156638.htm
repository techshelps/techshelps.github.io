             UPDATED OFFPRO97.INF FILE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL
             ENGLISH VERSION OF THE SERVICE RELEASE 1 PATCH

                            January 1998
            ---------------------------------------------------
                   (C) Microsoft(R) Corporation, 1998

</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
This updated Offpro97.inf file addresses a problem that occurs after
you install the Service Release 1 (SR-1) Patch for the International
English version of Microsoft(R) Office 97 Professional Edition with
Microsoft Bookshelf(R) Basics. When this problem occurs, you can no
longer run the Setup program in maintenance mode. When you attempt
to do so, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup Error 825 Object 9807. Your setup files may be damaged.
   Try restarting the setup program from where you originally ran
   it.

</PRE>This message is followed by similar messages for Object 10004,
Object 9905, and Object 9906.
<P>
Then, the following message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Office 97 setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE>The problem occurs because the patch modifies the Off97Pro.inf
file, which causes the maintenance mode installation to fail.
<P>
NOTE: This problem affects only the International English version
of Microsoft Office 97 Professional with Bookshelf.  All other
versions of Microsoft Office 97 and individual programs are not
affected by this issue.
<P>
