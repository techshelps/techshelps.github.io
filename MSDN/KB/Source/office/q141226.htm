</PRE><P><LI>If it is absent, add the following line to the Autoexec.bat file in
   order to make the real mode CD-ROM driver available:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Windows\Command\Mscdex.exe /s
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This line must refer to the Command folder in the Windows folder.
<P>
   The line in the Autoexec.bat file on your computer may be different from
   the one above because the CD-ROM Setup program may add switches to the
   line. For example, the line might look similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>       C:\Windows\Command\Mscdex.exe /d:mscd001 /v /m:15
</PRE>
<P><LI>Verify that the Real Mode driver for the CD-ROM drive is noted in the
   Config.sys file. The easiest way to add the line is to run the CD-ROM
   Setup program.
<P>
   NOTE: If these drivers were already installed when you installed Windows
   95, they may still be in the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files, but they
   may be remarked out.

<P><LI>Disable the CD-ROM drive in Device Manager. To do so, follow these
   steps:
<P>
   a. Double-click My Computer.
<P>
   b. Double-click Control Panel.
<P>
   c. Double-click the System icon.
<P>
   d. Click the Device Manager tab.
<P>
   e. Click the CD-ROM drive, and then click the Properties button.
<P><PRE>      Note that you may need to expand a branch of the hardware
      tree by double-clicking the branch or by clicking the plus
      sign (+) to the left of the branch before you can click the
      CD-ROM drive.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: If the CD-ROM drive is on its own controller, you may
      also need to disable the controller. To do so, follow the
      steps above but choose the CD-ROM controller card in Step e.
</PRE><P>
   f. Click the Original Configuration (Current) check box to
<P><PRE>      remove the check mark.
</PRE><P>
   g. Click OK.
<P>
   h. Click OK.
<P>
   i. When the message "Starting Windows 95" appears, press F8.

<P><LI>Click Command Prompt Only.

<P><LI>To start Windows in Safe Mode with access to the CD-ROM drive, type the
   following at the command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Win /d:m
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run the Setup program on the Microsoft Office Professional compact disc.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Two driver files are required to access a CD-ROM drive in real mode. These
files include a real-mode driver supplied by the CD-ROM drive manufacturer
(which must be loaded in the Config.sys file), and the Mscdex.exe file
(which must be loaded in the Autoexec.bat file).
