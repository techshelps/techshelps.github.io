The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows Explorer for Microsoft Windows NT maps network drive
letters to network shares even though you did not map any drives.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs in two cases.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1</h3>
 
<P>
Network drives are mapped to network shares if both of the following
conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You perform a search in either the Open dialog box or the Advanced Find
   dialog box in any Microsoft Office 97 program.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The drive you search contains shortcuts that specify a target location
   that uses a network drive letter instead of a universal naming
   convention (UNC) path (for example, \\Server\Share).
<P>
</UL><h3>Case 2</h3>
 
<P>
This behavior also occurs when both of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>Find Fast is installed in your Startup group.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You index a drive that contains shortcuts that specify a target location
   that uses a network drive letter instead of a UNC path.
<P>
</UL>Under Microsoft Windows NT, when a shortcut with a target path that
contains a drive letter is resolved, Windows NT maps the shortcut to a
logical drive.
<P>
This is system behavior that occurs under Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0.
This behavior is exposed when you perform a search against drives that
contain shortcuts that point to a target drive is a static drive letter.
For example, a shortcut to a Microsoft Word document that uses the
following target
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;drive&gt;:\Folder\Myfile.doc

</PRE>where &lt;drive&gt; is a network server, maps a new drive to the server using the
next available drive letter in Windows Explorer.
<P>
Microsoft Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server version 4.0 shortcuts
attempt to embed a UNC path, for example, \\&lt;machine&gt;\admin$, for the .lnk
file.
<P>
For more information about shortcuts under Windows NT 4.0, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q158682.htm">Q158682</A></B>
   TITLE     : Shortcuts Created Under NT 4.0 Resolve to UNC Paths

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the following appropriate methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Install Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3</h3>
 
<P>
For information about obtaining and installing this service pack, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q152734.htm">Q152734</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Obtain Windows NT Versiom 4.0 U.S. Service Pack

</PRE><h3>Method 2: Avoid Searching Folders That Contain Shortcuts</h3>
 
<P>
Because Windows NT maps a network drive for each shortcut with a target
drive that uses a drive letter, narrow your search to include only those
folders that do not contain shortcuts to documents located on network
drives.
<P>
Shortcut file names contain the .lnk file name extension. As an
alternative, consider moving .lnk files to a different folder before you
index or search.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3: Change Shortcut Target Locations to UNC Paths</h3>
 
<P>
In the Properties dialog box for each shortcut, change the Target for the
shortcut from a static drive letter to a UNC path. For example, change
<P>
<PRE>   E:\Folder1\Myfile.doc"

</PRE>to
<P>
<PRE>   \\&lt;Server\&lt;Shared Folder&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;Server&gt; is the name of the computer or server and &lt;Shared Folder&gt; is
the shared folder on that drive.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 4: Disable Microsoft Find Fast</h3>
 
<P>
Disabling Find Fast may help to minimize this problem. However, this method
does not resolve the behavior and may not work in every situation.
Microsoft does not recommend disabling Find Fast if you are administering a
Microsoft Windows NT server.
<P>
NOTE: If you are running Microsoft Windows NT Server and install the
Srvpack on the Microsoft Office 97 compact disc, removing Find Fast
disables several features, including the Web search features. See the
Webadhlp.htm file in the Srvpack folder on your Office 97 compact disc for
more information.
<P>
For information about removing Find Fast, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A HREF="../OFFICE/Q158705.htm">Q158705</A></B>
   TITLE     : OFF97: How to Disable the Find Fast Indexer

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Find Fast program builds indexes to speed up finding documents from the
Open and Advanced Find dialog boxes in Microsoft Office programs. Find Fast
is installed by the Microsoft Office Setup program as an Office Tools
component. Setup automatically creates an index for all of your Office
documents on each local drive on the computer.
