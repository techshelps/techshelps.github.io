The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.2-CD
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3-CD
</UL> 
<P>
In addition to the Complete/Custom, Typical, and Minimum installation
options, Microsoft Office on CD-ROM includes a new installation option: Run
From CD. This installation option allows you to have complete functionality
and uses only a fraction of the disk space that the other installation
options use.
<P>
There are five different local installation methods that you can
perform from the CD version of Office.
<P>
<PRE>   Type of Installation  Description of Installation
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Typical               Installs the most common features of the
                         Microsoft Office applications. This option
                         saves space on your computer's hard disk.

   Complete/Custom       Lets you install all of the Microsoft Office
                         components, or allows you to select only the
                         features, files, and utilities that you want
                         to install. This option provides the most
                         flexibility of all of the installation options.

   Minimum               Lets you select only the applications you want
                         and installs the minimum files required to run
                         those applications. This option is particularly
                         useful when disk space is limited.


   Workstation           Available only if you are setting up Office
                         from a network and your network administrator
                         provides this option. Workstation installation
                         saves space on your hard disk; note that
                         performance may be slow if the network is busy
                         or is unavailable.

   Run From CD           Similar to a Workstation installation,
                         except that the programs and necessary files
                         are copied to the hard drive in order to
                         serialize the programs; all other files are
                         run from the CD. Saves space on your hard disk,
                         but the CD must be inserted in your CD-ROM
                         drive in order to run the applications.

</PRE>In order to conduct a Network (Administrative) installation to the server,
you need to run SETUP.EXE from the SETUP.ADM\DISK1 directory. To run this
type of Setup, type the following into the Run command line after choosing
Run from the File menu in Windows Program Manager:
<P>
<PRE>   D:\setup.adm\disk1\setup.exe /a

</PRE>and continue with the Administrative installation to your server. If you
attempt to run the Administrative setup from the root directory of your
hard drive, you receive the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup /a is not supported in this mode.
