The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Access 97
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
<LI>Microsoft Project 98 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start any of the programs listed at the beginning of this
article, you may receive either of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Error Starting Program
   A required .DLL file, MSO97.DLL, was not found.

   -or-

   &lt;Program&gt; requires the file 'MSO7enu.DLL' to run. Run Setup again to
   assure proper installation.

</PRE>where &lt;Program&gt; is the name of the program you are attempting to start.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You run Setup from an administrative installation point and click "Run
   from Network Server."
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You choose to keep all shared components on the server.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You then perform a Typical or a Custom installation for a stand-alone
   version of any of the Office programs listed at the beginning of this
   article from the program compact disc or from a different network server
   or share.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You start the stand-alone program.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, do not install a stand-alone
version of the program after you perform a "Run from Network Server"
installation on the same computer. To install a stand-alone version of
Microsoft Outlook after you perform a "Run from Network Server"
installation of other Office 97 program, perform a "Run from Network
Server" installation of Microsoft Outlook 97.
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following two methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Copy Ms*.dll Files to the Folder Indicated in the Registry</h3>
 
<P>
Copy the .dll files that the program cannot find to the folder that the
program searches.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
To determine which folder to copy the files to, look in the registry. The
following registry key indicates the folder that an Office program search
for the Mso97.dll and Mso7enu.dll files:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\8.0\BinDirPath

</PRE>For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
If you copy Mso97.dll and Mso7enu.dll to the folder referenced by this
key, you can prevent the problem from occurring. To do this, use the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open box, type "regedit"
   (without the quotation marks) and click OK.

<P><LI>Double-click the plus signs (+) to open the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\8.0
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click the folder to the left of 8.0.

<P><LI>Write down the name of the folder that appears to the right of the
   BinDirPath entry in the value pane. (Usually, the location is
   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office.)
<P>
   The folder that is displayed is the folder in which you must copy
   Mso97.dll and Mso7enu.dll.

<P><LI>On the Registry menu, click Exit.
<P>
</OL>After you record the folder name referred by the BinDirPath key, use the
Windows Explorer to copy Mso97.dll and Mso7enu.dll into that folder from
the product's compact disc or from a network server that contains an
administrative installation of the product.
<P>
After you copy the Mso97.dll and Mso7enu.dll files to the correct folder,
start the stand-alone program.
<P>
<P><h3>Method Two: Change the PATH Statement in Autoexec.bat</h3>
 
<P>
You can also prevent this problem from occurring by modifying the PATH
statement in the Autoexec.bat file so that it refers to the folder on the
network server that contains Mso97.dll and Mso7enu.dll. (Usually, these
files are located in the Msoffice\Office folder on the network server.)
<P>
NOTE: To use this method, you must assign a permanent drive letter to the
network server and share. To do this, use the Map Network Drive button in
the Windows Explorer to connect a drive letter.
<P>
To modify the Autoexec.bat file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open box, type
   "notepad c:\autoexec.bat" (without the quotation marks) and click OK.

<P><LI>If the PATH statement exists, add the path to the network server to it.
   For example, if Autoexec.bat contains the following line
<P>
<P><PRE>      PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND
</PRE><P>
   add a semicolon (;) and the path to the network server.
<P>
   For example, if drive G is connected to the network, add
   "G:\MSOFFICE\OFFICE" (without the quotation marks) to the end of the
   line as in the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND;G:\MSOFFICE\OFFICE
</PRE><P>
   If the PATH statement does not exist, add the statement as in the
   following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      PATH=G:\MSOFFICE\OFFICE
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save. Then, click Exit on the File menu.
<P>
</OL>After you finish, restart the computer. You can then start the stand-alone
program without receiving any error messages.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install any of the programs listed at the beginning of
this article, many keys, including the BinDirPath key, are created
in your registry.
<P>
The BinDirPath key refers to the folders in which programs search for
certain dynamic-link library (DLL) files, including Mso97.dll and
Mso7enu.dll. In most cases, these two files are stored in the same folder
as the program files that use them. However, if you perform a "Run from
Network Server" installation of Microsoft Office 97, and then perform an
installation of a stand-alone program, the BinDirPath key may point to a
folder that does not contain Mso97.dll or Mso7enu.dll.
<P>
If this occurs, you may not be able to start the stand-alone program
because it cannot find Mso97.dll and Mso7enu.dll in the folder. Programs
installed as part of Microsoft Office 97 start correctly because the
program files are in the same folder as the Mso97.dll and Mso7enu.dll
files.
