<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the limitations of graphics import filters provided
with Office 95. This information is also available in each applications
Help (in Help, click the Index tab, and type "graphics filters").
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can import clip art, pictures, movies, or almost any computer image
into PowerPoint. This feature allows you to take advantage of the libraries
of artwork already available without having to draw new artwork yourself.
Microsoft applications imports images from other applications by using
graphics filters, which are installed when you run the applications Setup.
<P>
<P><h3>Limitations on Importing Graphics in Windows</h3>
 
<P>
If you have trouble importing a graphic, the problem may be due to
differences between the original graphic format and the way Windows handles
graphics. Limitations in graphic primitives in Windows pictures prevent
display and printing of:

<UL><LI>Mirrored or backward text

<LI>Rotated or vertical text (unless scalable or vector fonts are
   used)

<LI>Double underline and outline
<P>
</UL>Windows may not scale an image as expected. For example, if a bitmap
is reduced or viewed at less than 100 percent, display information
may be lost. This can result in odd patterns or gridlines. Pieces
such as thin lines may appear to be missing on-screen. When you
print, however, the complete picture is present.
<P>
If the image is an object- or vector-oriented picture, text can only
be scaled by its point size. Stretching a character to make it
disproportionately tall or wide may result in poor text layout.
<P>
<P><h3>The Kodak Photo CD (.pcd) Filter</h3>
 
<P>
The PCD filter imports images at a resolution of 512 x 768 pixels in
256 colors. If you use the Kodak Photo CD filter with the PowerPoint
Picture command on the Insert menu, you can change these settings
when you insert a picture.
<P>
<P><h3>Default Resolutions for the Kodak Photo CD Filter</h3>
 
<P>
The following resolutions support 256 colors (8 bit). The quality
of the images is lower, but they are displayed and printed more quickly.
<P>
<PRE>   Default resolution number       Resolution
   -----------------------------------------------------------
     0                             512 x 768 (default)
     1                             128 x 192 (small picture)
     2                             256 x 384
     3                             1024 x 1536
     4                             2048 x 3072 (large picture)

</PRE>The following resolutions support 16.7 million colors (24 bit). The
quality of the images is high, but they are displayed and printed slowly.
<P>
<PRE>   Default resolution number       Resolution
   --------------------------------------------------------------

     5                             512 x 768 (small picture, high
                                              quality)
     6                             128 x 192
     7                             256 x 384
     8                             1024 x 1536 (large picture,
                                                high quality)

</PRE><h3>The AutoCAD Format 2-D (.dxf) Filter</h3>
 
<P>
The AutoCAD DXF graphics filter supports all AutoCAD versions through
Release 12, including AutoCAD for Windows support.
<P>
The DXF filter has the following limitations:

<UL><LI>Extrusions that are part of 3-D drawings are not supported.

<LI>Control codes and special characters embedded in text shapes that
   require special characters are not supported.

<LI>DXF files that require separate shape definition files are
   not supported.

<LI>For multiple viewport .DXF files, the file is imported using
   the current viewport.
<P>
</UL><h3>The CompuServe GIF (.gif) Filter</h3>
 
<P>
The CompuServe GIF filter supports versions GIF87a and GIF89a.
Transparency is ignored.
<P>
<P><h3>The Computer Graphics Metafile (.cgm) Filter</h3>
 
<P>
You can use the Computer Graphics Metafile (.cgm) filter to import .cgm
graphics files that conform to version 1 of the CGM specification.
The following types are supported:

<UL><LI>Line type: standard ANSI set

<LI>Marker type: standard ANSI set

<LI>Edge type: standard ANSI set

<LI>Line elements: polyline, disjoint polyline, circular arc 3 point,
   circular arc center, and elliptical arc Pens with a physical
   width greater than one pixel will always have a solid style.
   (A nonsolid-style pen always has a width of one pixel.)

<LI>Fill elements: polygon, polygon set, rectangle, circle, circular
   arc 3, point close, circular arc center close, elliptical arc
   close, and ellipse

<LI>Interior style: solid, pattern, hatch, and empty

<LI>Text elements: text, restricted text, and append text Attribute
   changes within a text string are not recognized

<LI>Polygon set
<P>
</UL>The following CGM graphical primitive and attribute elements are
not supported:

<UL><LI>Cell array

<LI>Character spacing

<LI>Character orientation

<LI>Character set index (only one character set is used)

<LI>Interior style (only hollow and solid are supported)

<LI>Pattern table

<LI>Pattern size

<LI>Gradients and bitmap fill patterns

<LI>Strike-through and underline attributes unless the source
   application simulates the styles by drawing lines
<P>
</UL><h3>The CorelDRAW (.cdr) Filter</h3>
 
<P>
The CorelDRAW filter has the following limitations:

<UL><LI>Rotated rounded rectangles are emulated using circular arc center.

<LI>Vector pattern fills are not fully supported.

<LI>Envelope editing and perspective editing are not supported.

<LI>Bitmaps are not supported.

<LI>Extruded object groups are not fully supported.

<LI>OLE objects are not supported.

<LI>Line scaling is not supported.

<LI>Fractal Fills are not supported.

<LI>Lenses are not supported.
<P>
</UL><h3>The Encapsulated PostScript (.eps) Filter</h3>
 
<P>
This .eps graphics filter supports the Adobe Systems Encapsulated
PostScript Specification versions 1.0 and 2.0. The .eps filter
supports .eps images with tagged image file format (TIFF) 5.0 or
Windows metafile (.wmf) embedded display images. If an .eps file
contains an embedded TIFF or WMF display image, a representation of
the image is displayed. The quality of the displayed image depends on
the resolution of the TIFF or WMF image embedded in the .eps file.
Because such display images are intended primarily to be used to
position images on the page, resolution is often low.
<P>
If an embedded TIFF or WMF display image is not included, or if the image
is considered invalid by the converter, a graphics bounding box appears
instead of a display image.
<P>
EPS file format requirements:
<P>
The EPS graphics filter isn't designed to reinterpret a file's
PostScript code to overcome nonstandard content. If an .eps file
doesn't follow Adobe specifications, PowerPoint shows a bounding
box for the image on the screen and sends the original PostScript
code to a PostScript printer. Some applications can create
printer-specific .eps files by intercepting PostScript output and
making a file. However, because of inconsistencies among applications,
a PostScript file generated by a printer driver for one PostScript
printer may not be printed correctly on another PostScript printer.
<P>
NOTE: There are two lines that must be present in the EPS header (the first
part of the .eps file). (In the first line, you can substitute 1.0 for
2.0.)
<P>
<PRE>   %!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF-2.0
   %%BoundingBox: LLx LLy URx URy

</PRE><h3>The HP Graphics Language (HPGL) Filter</h3>
 
<P>
This filter supports HP-GL/2 kernel commands and command extensions.
To ensure the best results when importing HP-GL/2 files, configure
your application to create commands suitable for a 7595 Draft Master
plotter.
<P>
The HPGL filter doesn't support Polyline Encoding or Color Table
commands. The filter supports display of color images and assumes
the following pen color set.
<P>
<PRE>   Pen number     Color
   ---------------------

   1              Black
   2              Red
   3              Green
   4              Yellow
   5              Blue
   6              Magenta
   7              Cyan
   8              Orange

</PRE><h3>The Joint Photographic Experts Group (.jpg) Filter</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Joint Photographic Experts Group filter to import .JPG files.
<P>
<P><h3>The Lotus 1-2-3 graphics files (.PIC) filter</h3>
 
<P>
This filter supports .PIC files created by Lotus 1-2-3 and Borland
Quattro Pro. However, the filter doesn't support Micrografx .PIC
or Draw Plus .PIC.
<P>
<P><h3>The Macintosh PICT (.pct) Filter</h3>
 
<P>
This filter supports both PICT and PICT2 formats.
<P>
<P><h3>The Micrografx Designer/Draw (.drw) Filter</h3>
 
<P>
This filter supports Micrografx Designer 3.x, Charisma 2.1, and Draw
.drw files. The .drw filter imports only the entire first page of a
file as it would appear in Micrografx Designer, because .drw files
don't contain information on the size of the image. Once the image is
imported, the bounding box may be cropped to make it fit the size of
the image.
<P>
Here are some limitations of the Micrografx Designer/Draw filter:

<UL><LI>Text arrays are not supported.
<LI>Some Micrografx Designer 3.x fonts are not supported.
<LI>Clip paths, which require clipping regions, aren't supported in
   GDI metafiles.
<LI>Tiled paths, which permit object-oriented fills to be put behind
   clip paths, aren't supported.
<P>
</UL><h3>The PC Paintbrush (.pcx) Filter</h3>
 
<P>
The .pcx graphics filter PCXIMP32.FLT supports all versions of the
PCX file format through ZSoft's version 3.0, with support for
256-color images. This is the common interchange format used by
Microsoft Windows Paintbrush.
<P>
<P><h3>The Tag Image File Format (.tif) Filter</h3>
 
<P>
The TIFF 5.0 filter supports all image types and compression types
described in the TIFF Specification Revision 5.0. These types include
monochrome, grayscale, palette color, and RGB full color images.
This filter does not support TIFF Revision 6.0.
<P>
<P><h3>The Targa (.tga) filter</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Targa filter to import .tga graphics files.
<P>
<P><h3>The WordPerfect Graphics (.wpg) filter</h3>
 
<P>
This filter uses the size of the picture frame stored in the WordPerfect
file to determine the size of the picture to import. The frame size of .wpg
graphics created in DrawPerfect is the size of the screen.
<P>
The limitations of this filter are as follows:

<UL><LI>.eps images in .wpg format don't maintain PostScript code when
   inserted into a presentation.

<LI>.wpg files with large embedded bitmaps may not be displayed properly
<P><PRE>    on computers that use the Mach series video drivers from ATI. If
    you think you have this problem, try changing your video driver
    to the 8514/a drivers supplied with Windows.
