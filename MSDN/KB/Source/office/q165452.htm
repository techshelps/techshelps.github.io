<P>
This document provides late-breaking or other information that is
relevant to the Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition.
For late-breaking information specific to an individual Office 97
product, see the readme file for that product: WdRead8.txt
(Microsoft Word 97), XlRead8.txt (Microsoft Excel 97), OlReadme.txt
(Microsoft Outlook 97), Readme.hlp (Microsoft Publisher 97), and
Readme.txt (Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager 97).
<P>
INSTALLING MICROSOFT OFFICE 97 SMALL BUSINESS EDITION
<P>
<P><h3>Autorun</h3>
 
<P>
Every time the Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition CD is
inserted into the CD-ROM drive, Autorun is launched. Clicking on a
component button in Autorun will launch that component's setup.exe.
<P>
There are limitations with Autorun:

<UL><LI>Autorun does not distinguish if the CD is inserted to access files
   rather than access Autorun. If, while working in an application, you
   are asked to insert the CD and find a specific file, Autorun will
   launch. Click the 'x' box in the upper-right corner of the Autorun
   window to close Autorun.

<LI>Autorun does not work with Windows NT 3.51, and may be incompatible
   with some CD-ROM drives on other systems. If the Autorun screen does
   not appear after inserting the CD, the setup programs may be started
   manually.
<P>
</UL>To start the setup for a particular component, perform one of the
following steps:

<UL><LI>In Windows Explorer or in File Manager, locate the directory of
   the application on the CD-ROM, and then double-click Setup.exe
<P>
   For example, to start the setup for Microsoft Excel, find
   D:\Excel\Setup.exe.
<P>
   In Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation 4.0, click
   Run on the Start menu, and then type D:\Excel\setup.exe.
<P>
   In Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 3.51, click Run on the File
   menu, and then type D:\Excel\Setup.exe.
<P>
</UL>The locations of the various components are as follows:

<UL><LI>Word 97              &lt;drive_letter&gt;:\Word\Setup.exe
<LI>Excel 97             &lt;drive_letter&gt;:\Excel\Setup.exe
<LI>Outlook 97           &lt;drive_letter&gt;:\Outlook\Setup.exe
<LI>Publisher 97         &lt;drive_letter&gt;:\Pub\Setup.exe
<LI>Financial Manager 97 &lt;drive_letter&gt;:\Sbfm\Setup.exe
<P>
</UL>To view the ValuPack Help file, locate the ValuPk8.hlp file in the
ValuPack directory on the CD:

<UL><LI>ValuPack             &lt;drive_letter&gt;:\ValuPack\Valupk8.hlp
<P>
<P>
</UL><h3>Error clicking links in ValuPack Help File</h3>
 
<P>
When accessing the ValuPack Help file through Autorun, some links may
return the Windows Help error:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find or run the file or program ..."

</PRE>Installing ValuPack items may only work the first time the ValuPack
Help file is accessed through Autorun. Once the ValuPack Help file is
opened through AutoRun and closed, components may not be available through
AutoRun. To install components from the ValuPack Help file in more than
one session, double-click the ValuPk8.hlp file located in the ValuPack
directory on the CD.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Microsoft Publisher 97</h3>
 
<P>
36 of the 5000+ pieces of clipart provided by Publisher have dashes in
their filenames and cannot be read by Windows NT 3.51. If Custom setup is
selected, and the 'select all' option is chosen to install all the clipart
to the hard drive, an error message will appear when setup tries to install
each of these 36 files. The error will give the option to retry, ignore, or
abort. To continue with the rest of the installation, click 'ignore' for
each of these error messages. This problem will not be encountered when
doing a 'Complete' install.
<P>
<P><h3>Reviewing the online guide "Doing Business on the Internet"</h3>
 
<P>
You must have IE3.0+ in order to review this online documentation.
IE3.0+ does not support Windows NT 3.51 therefore this guide cannot be
viewed on this platform.
