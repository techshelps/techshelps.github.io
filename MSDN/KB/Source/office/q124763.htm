The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3-CD
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a typical, custom/complete, or laptop installation of
Microsoft Office for Windows version 4.3-CD and the CD-ROM has been set up
as a shared resource on a Novell network, you may encounter the following
message
<P>
<PRE>   Could not write to the &lt;drive&gt;\custom.dic

</PRE>Where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive mapped to the CD-ROM server. Following this
message, the server may lock up.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when Microsoft Office Setup has copied approximately 21%
of the files and is trying to create the CUSTOM.DIC file in the
MSAPPS\PROOF directory. It occurs in any type of installation, other than
an administrative installation, when Microsoft Excel is included in the
installation.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs only when Microsoft Excel is included in the
installation. To install Microsoft Office Professional, do either of the
following:

<UL><LI>Perform an Administrative Setup (Setup /a) of Microsoft Office from
   the Shared CD-ROM to another server and run the setup from the second
   server.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Perform a Custom/Complete Setup of Microsoft Office from the shared CD-
   ROM and do not include Microsoft Excel. In order to install Microsoft
   Excel, perform an administrative installation of Office to another
   server and install Microsoft Excel from the other server.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office version
4.3 for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>

Microsoft Office, see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
