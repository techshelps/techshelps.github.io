The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.2
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To set up one of the Microsoft applications listed above on a server so
that you can install the application to either an Alpha or Intel
workstation, you need to create two separate installations on the server:
one that was created by running Setup /a from an Alpha machine, and one
that was created by running Setup /a from an Intel machine.
<P>
The following information describes how to create platform-specific
installations of the Microsoft applications listed above on the network
server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that these instructions were taken from the README.TXT file that ships
with Microsoft Office for Windows NT. This information was not included
with Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word. This document supplements the
OFREADME.HLP file. If you are installing Microsoft Office for Windows NT,
please see OFREADME.HLP for complete information on network installations
of Microsoft Office.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating an Administrative Installation for a Multi-platform Environment</h3>
 
<P>
A single administrative image cannot provide installations for all
platforms of Microsoft Windows NT. For each platform that will be used, you
need to create a separate administrative image.
<P>
To create an installation that can be installed locally or run from the
server:
<P>
<PRE>   For an Intel-build version of the administrative installation, connect
   to the server from an Intel-based workstation, and follow the
   instructions to create an administrative install.

   For an Alpha-build version of the administrative installation, connect
   to the server from an Alpha-based workstation, and follow the
   instructions to create an administrative install.

</PRE>To create an installation that installs the application locally, and will
not run from the server:
<P>
<PRE>   Copy the complete program directory from the CD to the server. For
   example, copy the entire EXCEL.NT directory from the CD to the server
   hard drive. This will enable you to run setup from the server location,
   and create local installations of the applications.
