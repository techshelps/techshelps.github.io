The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run any of the programs listed at the beginning of this article,
the program creates the following new folders in the Windows\Temp folder,
or in some other folder on your computer:
<P>
<PRE>   Excel8.0
   Ppt8.0
   Word8.0
   Vbe

</PRE>NOTE: These folders contain files with the .exd extension.
<P>
This article explains why these folders and files are created, and what
happen if you delete them.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The programs listed at the beginning of this article create the folders
when you use the Control Toolbox to insert an ActiveX control in a
document. The programs also create the folders when you insert any type of
control in a custom UserForm. The following table lists which folders are
created when you insert an ActiveX control or another control.
<P>
<PRE>   Folder      Created by inserting
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Excel8.0    An ActiveX control in a Microsoft Excel worksheet

   Ppt8.0      An ActiveX control in a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation
   Word8.0     An ActiveX control in a Microsoft Word document
   Vbe         Any type of control in a custom UserForm in Microsoft Excel,
               Microsoft Word, or Microsoft PowerPoint

</PRE>Normally, the programs create these folders in the Windows\Temp folder.
However, if the Windows\Temp folder does not exist, the files may be
created elsewhere on your computer.
<P>
The first time you insert a control into a document or UserForm, the
program in which you inserted the control creates an .exd file for that
control in the appropriate folder. After program creates the .exd file for
a specific control, it takes less time to insert the same control again.
This is because the .exd file caches information for the control.
<P>
The program that creates the .exd files does not delete them when you quit
the program. The next time you start the same program and insert the same
control, the .exd files are still available for the program to use.
<P>
If you delete any of the folders listed above, or any of the .exd files
they contain, you do not receive any error messages, and no problems occur.
However, you may notice a slight decrease in performance the first time you
insert a control because the .exd file for that control does not exist.
After the program recreates the .exd file, you can reinsert the control
with improved performance.
