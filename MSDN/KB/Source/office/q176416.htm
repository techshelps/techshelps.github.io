The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you double-click a cabinet (.cab) file, and then attempt to extract a
file from the cabinet file to a location on the hard disk on your computer,
the file may not be extracted. When this problem occurs, you do not receive
an error message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if you install the CABFILE Viewer utility (CabView
program) that is included on Disk 1 of Microsoft Office 97 that is on 3.5-
inch DMF floppy disks.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the CabView program that is included on
Disk 1 of Microsoft Office 97 for Windows, Service Release 1 (SR-1) that is
on 3.5-inch DMF floppy disks.
<P>
For information about obtaining Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 on floppy disks,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1

</PRE>After you obtain Microsoft Office 97 SR-1, install the updated version of
the CabView program. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert Disk 1 into the floppy disk drive on the computer.

<P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open box, type "a:\" (without
   the quotation marks) and click OK.

<P><LI>Right-click the Cabview or Cabview.inf file. On the shortcut menu, click
   Install.
<P>
</OL>After the necessary files are copied from the floppy disk to the hard disk
on your computer, you can both view and extract files from cabinet files.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in the
CabView program included with Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 that is on 3.5-inch
DMF floppy disks.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The CabView file allows you to view the contents of cabinet files and to
extract files from cabinet files without having to use the Extract.exe
program.
<P>
After you install CabView, you can view the contents of a cabinet file by
double-clicking the file. A new window, which is very similar to a window
in Microsoft Windows Explorer, appears and lists the contents of the
cabinet.
<P>
You can extract a file from a cabinet by doing either of the following:

<UL><LI>Right-click the file you want to extract and click Extract on the
   shortcut menu. In the Browse For Folder dialog box, click the folder
   in which you want to extract the file. Then, click OK.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Drag the file from the cabinet window to the desktop or to a specific
   folder window.
<P>
</UL>These steps may fail to extract the file if an older version of CabView is
installed on the computer. To determine which version of CabView is
installed, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

<P><LI>In the Named box, type "Cabview.dll" (without the quotation marks).
   Then, click Find Now.

<P><LI>Right-click Cabview.dll. On the shortcut menu, click Properties. Click
   the Version tab.
<P>
</OL>The versions and file sizes for the Cabview.dll file are listed in the
following table.
