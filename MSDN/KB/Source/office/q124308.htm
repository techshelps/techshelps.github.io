The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.30c-CD
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office 4.3c-CD jewelcase booklet includes the following
information about installing Bookshelf:
<P>
<PRE>   To install Bookshelf in a shared location see, "For Network
   Administrators: Before You Install," in the Office OFREADME.HLP file.

</PRE>However, this section in the Microsoft Office Readme Help file does
not contain specific information about installing Bookshelf in a
shared location. The following information discusses how to install
Bookshelf in a shared location.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>For Network Administrators: Before You Install Office with Bookshelf '94</h3>
 
<P>
This document provides information on using Microsoft Office Professional
with Bookshelf '94 on a network. It includes information to help a network
administrator set up Office with Bookshelf '94 on a network and information
for people to set up Office with Bookshelf '94 on their workstation over
the network.
<P>
IMPORTANT: To comply with the license agreement for Microsoft Office
Professional with Bookshelf '94, you must have a license for each
workstation that has Office with Bookshelf installed. If you are
running Office with Bookshelf '94 over the network, then the total
number of users accessing the software simultaneously over the
network must be equal to the total number of licenses you have. There
must also be a reasonable mechanism or process in place to restrict
the number of users accessing the software simultaneously over the
network to the number of licenses in place. Please note that if you
have multiple copies of Office with Bookshelf '94 in CD-ROM form and
you are counting these copies as licenses for your use of Office with
Bookshelf '94 over the network, then you must archive these CD-ROM
copies and not make any other use of them for as long as you are
counting them as network copies. For more information on your
licensing rights for using Office with Bookshelf '94, please refer to
the end user license agreement which accompanies the software.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Use Office with Bookshelf '94 on a Network</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: This installation procedure will allow you to have Bookshelf
integration, but requires approximately 73 MB of space on the hard
drive of each workstation if you choose the "Run From CD" option.
Other installation options can reduce the hard drive space required,
for example if you select the Custom/Complete option, and only select
a few of the components. A normal Workstation installation of
Microsoft Office does not install Bookshelf, but will require minimal
space on the hard drive. Additionally, video and sound will be slower
running Bookshelf from a network drive since it must travel over the
network.

<P><LI>Switch to File Manager.

<P><LI>Connect to the shared CD ROM drive.

<P><LI>Copy all CD #1 and CD #2 files to the server. This will require 335 MB
