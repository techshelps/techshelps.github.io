The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office 97, Microsoft Excel 97, and all of the other programs
listed above are shipped on CD-ROM only. This article explains how you may
obtain these programs on floppy disks directly from Microsoft.
<P>
NOTE: The Microsoft Small Business Edition (SBE) is NOT available on floppy
disks. The SBE is not available on disks because not all of programs
included with the SBE are available on floppy disks.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Because of the large number of floppy disks that would be required to hold
all of the files used by Microsoft Office 97 and the other programs listed
above, these programs are shipped on CD-ROM only. CD-ROMs provide a number
of advantages over floppy disks, including:

<UL><LI>When you install from a CD-ROM, there is no need to switch disks
   constantly during Setup. This allows you can attend to other tasks
   while Setup copies files from the CD-ROM to your hard disk.

<LI>Unlike floppy disks, CD-ROMs cannot be infected by any type of virus.

<LI>CD-ROMs are faster and more reliable than floppy disks.

<LI>CD-ROMs are less expensive to manufacture than floppy disks. Shipping
   large products on CD-ROMs instead of floppy disks allows Microsoft to
   keep product prices as low as possible.

<LI>Because of the very large capacity of CD-ROMs, Microsoft can include a
   great deal of additional software on each CD-ROM. For example,
   products on CD-ROM include a ValuPack folder that contains Microsoft
   Internet Explorer 3.01, Microsoft Camcorder, sounds, extra clip art,
   cursors, fonts, and much more. These extra components are not
   available on floppy disks. Also, Microsoft Bookshelf Basics is
   available only on the CD-ROM version of Microsoft Office 97,
   Professional Edition.
<P>
</UL>If you need floppy disks for any reason (for example, you have a laptop
computer that has only a 3.5-inch disk drive), you can obtain a set of
floppy disks directly from Microsoft. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>Inside the product package, you should find a coupon that entitles you
   to a free set of floppy disks for that product. Fill out the coupon
   and send it to the address provided. Microsoft will send a set of floppy
   disks after it receives your coupon.

<P><LI>If you are in the United States of America, you can call the Microsoft
   Order Desk at (800) 360-7561 and request a set of floppy disks for
   each product you own. You will be asked to provide the CD key for each
   product; this number is inscribed on a sticker affixed to the back of
   the CD-ROM jewelcase.

<P><LI>If you are in another country, you can request a set of floppy disks
   by contacting your local Microsoft subsidiary.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: A set of floppy disks for Microsoft Office 97, Professional Edition,
contains approximately 50 disks. Performing an installation of Microsoft
Office 97 from such a set of disks can take up to two hours or more to
complete. Installation from CD-ROM is considerably faster.
<P>
Also note the following limitations of the floppy disk program:

<UL><LI>Floppy disks are available only in the 3.5-inch, high-density (1.44 MB)
   format. The 3.5-inch, 720 KB and 5.25-inch, 1.2 MB floppy disks are NOT
   available.

<LI>There is a limit of ONE free set of floppy disks per product per
   customer.

<LI>If you need an additional set of floppy disks (for example, your
   current set has become damaged, lost, or infected by a virus), you may
   order them from the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561, or from
   your local Microsoft subsidiary. A media, shipping, and handling
   charge may be applied to the order.
