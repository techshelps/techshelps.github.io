The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.2, 4.3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Office Setup program, when you choose the Change
Directory button in the dialog box that contains the installation types,
such as Typical, Complete/Custom, and Laptop (Minimum), the new directory
that you enter in the Change Directory box is ignored. Instead, the
Microsoft Office applications are installed to the directories that you
chose in the previous Setup dialog boxes.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because the Change Directory button in the Setup
dialog box that contains the buttons for the installation types is ignored.
At this point in the Setup program, you have already chosen a
directory to install each of the Microsoft Office applications, such
as the Microsoft Office Manager and Microsoft Excel.
<P>
Note that when you use this Change Directory button, the directory
name that you entered appears under Directory in the installation
options dialog box, however, the new directory is not used.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To change the directory to which you install one of the Microsoft
Office applications, when the installation options dialog box is
displayed in the Setup program, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Choose the Custom/Complete installation type button. The dialog box that
   appears allows you to select only the components that you want to
   install, and also to change the directory to which the Microsoft Office
   applications are installed.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Exit the Setup program, and run Setup again. You can then choose the
   location that the individual Microsoft Office applications are installed
   to before the dialog box that displays the different installation types
   appears.
<P>
</UL>Note that these procedures only work the first time you run Setup. The
workarounds above do not apply when you run Setup in maintenance mode.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft
products listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
