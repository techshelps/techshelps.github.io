<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Project for Windows 95, versions 4.0, 4.1
<LI>Microsoft Access version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Text Or Property field in the Open dialog box to search
for files in Microsoft Office for Windows 95, you may receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, a message similar to the following appears
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Program&gt; caused an invalid page fault in module MSO95.DLL at
   0137:506a705c.

</PRE>where &lt;Program&gt; is any Microsoft Office for Windows 95 application from
which you ran the Open dialog box and performed a content search. If you
perform the search from the Open dialog box of a Microsoft Office
application, the application hangs (stops responding). If you perform your
search from the Open dialog of the Office Start menu or the Office Shortcut
Bar, the Open dialog box is closed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs after you install Microsoft Access 7.0 from either the
stand-alone Microsoft Access version 7.0 package or the Microsoft Office
Professional for Windows 95 package, and you use the content search feature
in the Open dialog box as described in the following cases.
<P>
<PRE>   Case 1
   ------

   - You perform a content search, and you select All Files (*.*) or
     Databases (*.mdb) in the Files Of Type box.

     -and-

   - You include an .mdb file in your search path that was not created
     with Microsoft Access. For example, an .mdb file that you created
     with Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Project.

     -and-

   - You specify search text in the Text Or Property box in the Open
     dialog box.

   An .mdb file that you create with Visual Basic or Microsoft Project
   does not contain a property string. Because the Open dialog box must
   access the property string values when searching for content in .mdb
   files, an illegal operation error appears when the content search finds
   an .mdb file without a property string. Note that any .mdb file created
   outside of Microsoft Access lacks a property string value. An .mdb
   file that you create with Microsoft Access contains a property
   string.

   Case 2
   ------

   - You perform a content search, and you select All Files (*.*) or
     Databases (*.mdb) in the Files Of Type box.

     -and-

   - Your search path contains an .mdb file that contains 0 bytes.

     -and-

   - You specify search text in the Text Or Property box in the Open
     dialog box.

   You may have an .mdb file that contains 0 bytes if you use the Setup
   program to remove all of Microsoft Access version 7.0 or Microsoft
   Office Professional for Windows 95. When you remove Microsoft Access,
   0-byte .mdb files may be placed in a temporary folder on your hard
   disk. 0-byte .mdb files do not contain a property string. Because
   the Open dialog must access the property string values when you search
   for content in .mdb files, you receive an illegal operation error
   when the content search locates an .mdb file without a property
   string.

   Case 3
   ------

   - You perform a content search, and you select All Files (*.*) or
     Databases (*.mdb) in the Files of Type list box.

     -and-

   - Your search path contains an .mdb file.

     -and-

   - You specify search text in the Text Or Property box in the Find
     Fast dialog to search for an .mdb file.

     -and-

   - The search results in zero files found.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the following methods:
<P>
Method 1: For .mdb files that were not created with Microsoft Access
<P>
<PRE>          Use the following steps to open and close the .mdb file in
          Microsoft Access before using Find Fast:

          a. Open the .mdb file in Microsoft Access.

          b. Close the file.

          c. Start the Open dialog box and perform your content search.

</PRE>Method 2: For 0-byte .mdb files, delete the 0-byte .mdb files in the
<PRE>          Temp folder:

          a. Start Microsoft Windows Explorer.

          b. Select the Temp folder in the Windows folder and delete the
             0-byte .mdb files.

          c. Start the Open dialog and perform your content search.

</PRE>Method 3: For .mdb files on a read-only share, index all the files on
<PRE>          the server using the Find Fast indexer. To do this, use the
          following steps:

         a. From a computer that has read/write access to the share, go to
            the Control Panel Window, and double-click the Find Fast icon.

         b. On the Index menu, click Create Index.

         c. In the In And Below box, type the path where the index is to be
            created (note that you can use the Browse button to enter this
            information).

         d. In the Of Type box, select All Files (*.*).

</PRE>Method 3 has the advantage of speeding up file searches performed on a
server that is indexed because all files that can be found in a search are
indexed.
<P>
If the server being indexed is running Windows NT 3.51, you can use the
Find Fast NT service, which is included in the Office Resource Kit. The
Find Fast NT service is also available online. For additional information,
please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
