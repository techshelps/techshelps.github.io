The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows NT, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you perform a workstation installation of Microsoft Office,
when you choose About Microsoft Office from the Microsoft Office menu
on the MOM toolbar, the dialog box that is displayed does not contain
the name of the organization that the application is licensed to.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform an administrative installation (Setup /a) of
Microsoft Office, the Organization Information dialog box is
displayed, prompting you to enter your organization name. Normally,
this information is written to the MSOFFICE.EXE file on the server,
and is displayed when you choose About Microsoft office from the MOM
toolbar after performing a workstation installation of Microsoft
Office.
<P>
However, when you perform an administrative installation of Microsoft
Office Manager, following the instructions for performing an
administrative installation of Microsoft Office for Windows NT, the
organization information that you enter is not written to the
MSOFFICE.EXE file located on the server. If you then perform a
workstation installation of Microsoft Office Manager, and choose
About Microsoft Office from the Microsoft Office Manager on the
workstation, the box under "This product is licensed to" does not
contain the organization information.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft
products listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
