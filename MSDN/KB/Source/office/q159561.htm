<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Camcorder is a screen-capture technology that allows easy
creation of movies. It is a simple but powerful movie recorder and playback
utility. It captures screen events, stores them as a portable file, and
allows play back. This utility enables you to create movies and save them
in an .avi file format or export them in a .exe file format. The greatest
advantage is that people who receive the .exe file can play the movie
without having Camcorder installed on their computers.
<P>
This article will walk you through the steps for creating a sample movie in
a .avi file format and for creating a .exe which you can share with someone
who does not have Camcorder installed on his or her computer.
<P>

   automatically.

<P><LI>Press ESC on your keyboard or click the Stop button to stop the movie.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: These .exe files do not contain an Authenticode digital signature, a
certificate that renders programs tamper-proof, thus complicating Web
distribution. Clients downloading the .exe movies have no idea of whether
they contain a virus or not, and Microsoft Internet Explorer will display a
warning to this effect.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Code-Sign a Microsoft Camcorder .exe-Based Movie</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Windows Explorer, open the folder where Camcorder is installed. By

   For additional information on Digital Code Signing, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ierelease/Q155444.htm">Q155444</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Description of Digital Code Signing in Internet Explorer

</PRE><P><LI>Once it has been signed, rename Vxdsys.exe back to Vxdsys.vxd.
<P>
</OL>From this point forward, when you record movies and package them into 
stand-
alone .exe files, they will be digitally signed.
