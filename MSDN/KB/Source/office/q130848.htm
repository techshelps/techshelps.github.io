<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To remove an item that is displayed on the Office Shortcut Bar, such as a
toolbar or button, you can either hide or delete the item. When you hide an
item, the item is simply not displayed on the Shortcut Bar. However, when
you delete an item, the folder or file that the item represents may
actually be deleted from your computer's hard disk.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following table describes the method used to remove an item (hiding or
deleting) and the resulting action that occurs when you use the method.
<P>
<PRE>Method used          Result
</PRE> 
<PRE>Deleting a button    When you delete a toolbar button from the Shortcut
                     Bar, you also delete the item from the underlying
                     folder. In other words, when you delete a button,
                     Windows moves the item to the Recycle Bin.

                     NOTE: The reverse is also true: when you delete an
                     item from a folder, you also delete its toolbar button
                     on the Shortcut Bar.

Hiding a button      When you hide a button, it no longer appears on the
                     toolbar, but it is still part of the toolbar and the
                     item remains in its underlying folder.

Deleting a toolbar   When you delete a toolbar from the Shortcut Bar, you
                     permanently remove that toolbar entry from the Windows
                     registry, but you do not delete the toolbar's folder,
                     even if you originally created the toolbar from
                     scratch.

                     NOTE: You cannot delete the Office toolbar, but you
                     can hide it.

Hiding a toolbar     When you hide a toolbar, it no longer appears on the
                     Shortcut Bar, but it is still part of the Shortcut Bar
                     and its underlying folder remains intact. When a
                     toolbar is hidden, it still appears on the Office
                     Toolbar shortcut menu, but there is no check mark next
                     to it.
