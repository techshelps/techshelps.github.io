<PRE>1. Q. What components of Microsoft Office for Windows 95 are shared
      across the Office programs?

   A. The following tools and technologies are shared across Office
      for Windows 95 programs:

       - Answer Wizard

       - AutoCorrect list storage

       - Common dialog boxes for commands on the File menu such as
         New, Open, Properties, and Save

       - Find Fast

       - Graphics filters

       - MS Info

       - Microsoft Network (MSN) integration

       - Lotus Notes(R)/FX support

       - OLE servers (Graph, WordArt, Equation Editor, Data Map,
         ClipArt Gallery, Imager)

       - A common spelling checker

       - Text converters

2. Q. What is a document object?

   A. Office for Windows 95 introduces a new extension to OLE called
      "document objects." In the current model of program
      integration, small pieces of one program, for example a range
      of cells or chart in Microsoft Excel, are embedded in another
      program's document. Document objects enable an entire document
      to behave as a single object, complete with styles and print
      settings. Support for document objects lets you place any
      PowerPoint(R), Word, or Microsoft Excel document as a section
      in an Office Binder.

3. Q. How can I move information between programs?

   A. An easy way to move information between programs is to use the
      Windows 95 taskbar. Office for Windows 95 takes advantage of
      the taskbar, which displays all the open programs and folders
      in a bar on your screen, even if you are working in full-screen
      view. Taking advantage of OLE drag-and-drop technology, you can
      copy or move any piece of information, such as a chart, table,
      or paragraph, from one program to another simply by dragging
      the selection and dropping it onto the taskbar icon for the
      destination program. For example, to move a Microsoft Excel
      chart to Word, you can select the chart and drag it to the Word
      document icon on the taskbar; the Word document will
      automatically be maximized, and you can drop the chart anywhere
      in the document.

4. Q. What is the Office Binder file type?

   A. The document objects technology in Office for Windows 95
      introduces a new file type: Office Binder. Office Binder allows
      you to create a Binder document (similar to a Microsoft Excel
      workbook) that includes files from Word, Microsoft Excel,
      PowerPoint, and any other Office-compatible program that
      supports document object technology.

5. Q. How does a Binder work?

   A. A Binder can be thought of as a "workbook" where each section
      is a separate document, or, in other words, an electronic
      version of a three-ring binder. You can combine different
      documents by placing them into the Binder. Once in the Binder,
      the documents are stored as a single file in the file system,
      so they are opened and saved together. Furthermore, documents
      stay in the order in which they were placed, which makes using
      a Binder preferable to storing documents in a Windows folder.
      All "bound" documents can be printed together with cross-
      document page numbering. Because they are in a single file,
      Binders "travel" together, whether they're copied to a network
      drive or disks, or sent through electronic mail. If needed, you
      can easily break a Binder apart into separate documents, just
      as you can with a physical three-ring binder.
