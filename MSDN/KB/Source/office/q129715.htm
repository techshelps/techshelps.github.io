The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3c
<LI>Microsoft Setup program
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you perform an Administrative setup of Office, and you attempt to
perform a Local or Workstation setup, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   The INF Contains a Badly Formed File Description Line: Too Few Fields
   (Commas)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem only occurs after you perform an Administrative setup of
Microsoft Office and you then install Microsoft Word version 6.0 over an
existing installation of Word version 2.0 (as part of a Workstation or
Local setup).
<P>
The error message is caused by several incorrect lines in the ADMIN.INF.
The ADMIN.INF is a file that has the same purpose as the SETUP.INF, but is
specific to network installations. This file is located on Disk 1 (in the
CAB file). During the administrative installation, this file is copied to
the administrator's root directory and is renamed SETUP.INF.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P>
WARNING: This modification is not supported by Microsoft Product Support
Services (PSS). Although PSS will support some modifications to a BACKUP
copy of the SETUP.STF file, PSS will NOT support modification of the
SETUP.INF file. Note also that while PSS will help customers modify
specific lines of an STF, we will not rewrite the entire file in order to
achieve a desired configuration. As a general rule, support is limited to
options that can normally be changed by a user during a standard
installation of the application.
<P>
To fix this problem, you will need to do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Make a backup copy of the SETUP.INF file that resides in the MSOFFICE
   directory on the server.

<P><LI>Open SETUP.INF in Microsoft Word or an appropriate text editor.

<P><LI>Find the following section:  [WW2 dot files]

<P><LI>Add a comma to the end of each of the lines in the section. The
   specific lines are shown below:
<P>
<P><PRE>      1,LETBLOCK.DOT,,,,1994-06-10,,, OLDER,,,,,,,75776,,,,
      1,LETMDSEM.DOT,,,,1994-06-10,,, OLDER,,,,,,,13312,,,,
      1,LETMODBK.DOT,,,,1994-06-10,,, OLDER,,,,,,,13312,,,,
      1,LETPERSN.DOT,,,,1994-06-10,,, OLDER,,,,,,,12800,,,,
</PRE><P>

<P><LI>Save the SETUP.INF file and exit the text editor. Be sure that you
   have saved the file as a text file.
<P>
</OL>Once you have modified the SETUP.INF file, you will encounter an additional
problem. The files referenced by the INF are never copied to the
administrator's directory during an Administrative installation. This is
due to some missing logic in the Admin tree; the CopySection object for
these files is never called. As a result, when you perform a workstation or
local setup after the administrative setup, you receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable To Open File &lt;server/share&gt;\MSOFFICE\LETBLOCK.DOT

</PRE></OL>A similar error will be encountered for each of the above files. To work
around this problem, you will need to extract the above files to the
MSOFFICE directory on the server. These files are located on disk 16. Once
the files have been manually extracted, you can continue with the
workstation or local installation without receiving the error message.
