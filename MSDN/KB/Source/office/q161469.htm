following error messages appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot start the source application for this object.

   - or -

   The server application, source file, or item cannot be found.
   Make sure the application is properly installed, and that it has
   not been deleted, moved, or renamed.

error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Office Binder cannot add the section to the binder. This type of

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You install the Office program in a folder with a name that begins

   Office Pro."

   -and-

<LI>You install a component program from the ValuPack into a folder
   named "Microsoft Office." For example, you install the Microsoft
   Camcorder in the Microsoft Office\Mscam folder.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, remove the ValuPack and the Office
program, and then reinstall the programs. Note that you must install the
ValuPack program in the same folder in which you install Microsoft Office.
To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run Setup for the ValuPack program and click Remove All.

<P><LI>Run Setup for Microsoft Office and click Remove All.

<P><LI>Run Microsoft Office Setup again, select the program you want to
   reinstall and install it.

<P><LI>Run Setup for the ValuPack program. When you are prompted to select a
   folder in which to install the program, click Browse and select the same
   folder in which you installed Microsoft Office.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
