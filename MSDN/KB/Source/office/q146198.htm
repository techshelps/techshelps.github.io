<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a workstation installation of Microsoft Office 7.0, you
may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup was not completed successfully

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are using IBM LAN Server 4.0 network server software.
<P>
   NOTE: This problem has also been reported under the following network
   software:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DEC Pathworks version 4.0, 5.0D, and 5.1
      IBM OS/2
      LANtastic
      Novell NetWare versions 3.0, and 4.0
      Microsoft LAN Manager
</PRE><P>
   -and-

<LI>Your network administrator performs an administrative installation
   (setup /a) to a folder on the server.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You then perform a workstation installation from a workstation.
<P>
</UL>This behavior occurs because the administrative .stf file, Setup.stf, on
the server calls a custom action, RegistrationEngine, which fails without
warning when the Setup program installs Microsoft Excel. The Setup program
then fails.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, delete the reference to the RegistrationEngine
custom action in the Setup.stf file on the server.
<P>
WARNING: This modification may not be supported by Microsoft. Microsoft
support engineers will support some modifications to a BACKUP copy of the
Setup.stf file. Note also that while support engineers may help customers
modify specific lines of an STF, we will not rewrite the entire file in
order to achieve a desired configuration. As a general rule, support is
limited to options that can normally be changed by a user during a standard
installation of the application.
<P>
To modify the Setup.stf file, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the Setup.stf file and rename it.

<P><LI>In Microsoft Excel 5.0 or later, open the Setup.stf file.

<P><LI>In the Text Import Wizard dialog box, click Next until step 3 of the
    wizard appears.

<P><LI>In the Text Import Wizard - Step 3 Of 3 dialog box, under Data Preview,
    drag the vertical scrollbar down until Object ID appears in the Data
    Preview window. Click the first column to select it. Hold the SHIFT key
    down, drag the horizontal scrollbar to the right until the last column
    appears in the Data Preview window, and click the last column. All of
    the columns should be selected.

<P><LI>Under Column Data Format, click Text and click Finish.
<P>
    IMPORTANT: If you do not click the Text option in this step, Microsoft
    Excel reads some of the entries in the edited .stf file incorrectly.
    When this occurs, you receive Setup Parse error messages during setup.

<P><LI>Select columns A-K, click Column on the Format menu and click AutoFit
    Selection.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Find and search for "RegistrationEngine"
    (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Write down the Object Id number that is in the same row in column A.

<P><LI>In column F only, search for the Object Id number that you wrote down
    in step 8 and delete the Object Id number. Leave the other numbers
    intact.
<P>
    For example, if you determine that Object Id 4378 in column A
    corresponds to the text string "RegistrationEngine," search for 4378
    in column F and delete the number.

<P><LI>Click Save on the File menu, click Text (Tab delimited) in the Save
    File as Type box, and click OK.

<P><LI>Run the Setup program to perform a workstation installation.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Do not use an MS-DOS editor to modify the Setup.stf file. An MS-DOS
editor replaces tabs with spaces and causes a Setup error.
<P>
Because you disable the custom action that registers Microsoft Excel file
types in the previous steps, you must manually register each Microsoft
Excel file type.
<P>
NOTE: To modify the Setup.stf file, you must have the correct permissions
on the server. Please contact your network administrator before you attempt
to modify any Setup file on the server.
<P>
The Network Installation Wizard 1.1 has an option under Office Options to
"Modify setup for LanServer compatibilty" that may also resolve this
problem. For additional information, please see the following article(s) in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE></OL>NOTE: You cannot import the Excel7.reg file to register the Microsoft Excel
file types because the file requires a custom action to work.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
