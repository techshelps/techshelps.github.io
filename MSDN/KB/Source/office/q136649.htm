<P><h2>NETWORK INSTALLATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you have a license to install Microsoft Office on more than one client
computer, there are two ways you can install Office in your organization.
You can distribute the Office disks to each end user or you can install
Office on a network and have each end user install from there. The
information in this file explains the second option.

</PRE><h2>INSTALLING MICROSOFT OFFICE ON A NETWORK</h2>
 
<P>
Installing Office over the network is a two step process:

<OL><P><LI>The administrator creates the administrative installation point by
   creating the set of folders that will hold all the Office software and
   from which client installations will be done.

<P><LI>Users install Office by running Setup from the administrative
   installation point.
<P>
</OL>The same Setup.exe is used for each of these steps, although in
two different modes. To avoid confusion in the discussion below,
these two modes will be referred to as follows:
<P>
<PRE> * Administrative Setup
   - To create the administrative installation point, you run
     Setup.exe from the physical media with the /a command line
     option.

 * Client Setup
   - To perform a client installation, a user runs Setup.exe from
     the administrative installation point without the /a command
     line option.

</PRE></OL><h3>Creating the administrative installation point</h3>
 
<P>
You need to run administrative Setup under Windows 95, Windows NT 3.51 (or
later), or Windows NT Advanced Server 3.51 (or later).
<P>
The administrative installation point must have at least 180MB of disk
space, and you (the administrator) must have read, write, delete, and
create permission to this location. Users need read access as well. If your
users will be running in a shared Windows environment, you need to run
Setup in that same environment and you need write and create permissions to
the Windows folders.
<P>
Using the administrative mode of Setup, you need to install all of the
Office files from the CD or floppy disks to the administrative installation
point. This consists of two primary folders which will be created by Setup:

<OL><P><LI>\Msoffice - The main Office application files, such as
   Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel will be installed in this
   folder.

<P><LI>\Msapps - Shared components, such as Art Gallery and Word Art,
   will be installed in this folder.
<P>
</OL><h3>Administrative installation</h3>
 
<P>
Before doing the administrative installation of Office, make sure:

<UL><LI>Destination folders are empty. If a previous version of Office
   exists, delete all of it.
<LI>Users sharing applications or running shared Windows from this
   server are logged off.
<LI>Folders are locked to network user access during administrative
   installation.
<LI>Virus detection software is disabled.
<P>
</UL>[This section is not part of the original text of the document, but is
included here as a point of clarification.  Make sure virus detection
software on both the server *and* the workstation is disabled.]
<P>
To install Office on the administrative installation point:

<OL><P><LI>Run Setup.exe from the CD or floppy disk with the command line
   option /a: "setup.exe /a". Setup.exe must be run from a
   workstation with write access to the server, not directly on
   the server itself.
<P>
   NOTE: Double-clicking on Setup.exe in the File Manager
   (Windows NT) or Explorer (Windows 95) will not work. You need
   to use the Run command on the File menu of Program Manager or
   File Manager (Windows NT), or the Run command in the Start
   menu (Windows 95) to use the command line option /a. If you
   double-click on Setup.exe it will perform a client
   installation.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions on the screen.
<P>
   NOTES:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - The organization name you enter will be used for all client
      installations of Office from this network location.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - When asked for the server and path for the shared
      applications folder, enter the name in the same way that
      users will specify it when installing Office. You can
      specify whether the server will be accessed by users with a
      drive letter (for example, G:\) or a UNC path (for example,
      \\server\share). If you select drive letter, users
      installing Office will need to have that drive letter mapped
      to this folder before running client Setup.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - When Setup asks where you want the shared application files
      installed, the option you select controls the choices your
      users will have during client Setup:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       + Server............The shared application files will remain
<PRE></PRE>                           on the server and run remotely; the user
                           won't get a choice during client Setup.
       + Local Hard Drive..The shared application files will be
                           copied to the user's local hard drive;
                           the user won't get a choice during
                           client Setup.
       + User's Choice.....The user will be asked to choose Server
                           or Local Hard Drive during client Setup.

</PRE></OL>Setup then copies all files from the CD or floppy disks to the
administrative installation point.
<P>
After the installation is complete, share the two folders (\Msoffice and
\Msapps) on the network, either creating a single share that contains both
folders, or creating two separate shares, one for each folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Client installation</h3>
 
<P>
To install Office on the client computers, users will:

<OL><P><LI>Connect to the main Office folder on the administrative installation
   point.

<P><LI>Run Setup.exe.
<P>
</OL>When users run client Setup from this administrative installation point,
they will see the Run From Network Server option in addition to the other
installation options. If a user selects this option, the main Office
application files are left on the server and run remotely.
<P>
Note that when using the Run From Network Server option, Setup will place
approximately five megabytes of files in the user's main Office folder. For
workarounds that can reduce this disk space usage, see chapter 8,
"Installing Microsoft Office" in the "Microsoft Office for Windows 95
Resource Kit," or contact Product Support Services. See "For More
Information" at the end of this file for instructions on obtaining the
resource kit or connecting to support resources.
<P>
It is recommended that users have a read-only connection to the server
Office folder when they are running Setup, and also when they are running
the applications after a Run From Network Server installation.
<P>
<P><h2>INSTALLATION ISSUES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Office in Shared Windows for the First Time</h3>
 
<P>
The first time Office is installed to a user's computer in a shared Windows
environment, Setup will attempt to copy a few Office files into the shared
Windows folder. Although users normally have read-only access to the shared
Windows folder, the first client installation of Office does require write
access to copy these files.
<P>
After the first installation is completed, the first user's access rights
to the shared Windows folder can be set back to read-only. Subsequent users
installing Office need only read-only access to the Windows folder since
the needed files will already be present and Setup won't attempt to copy
them again.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating "My Documents" Folder on a Server for Multiple Users</h3>
 
<P>
If you have users who install Office in a user folder on a network share
(for example, users running on diskless workstations), the Office client
installation process must be planned carefully to inure that multiple users
do not share the same "My Documents" folder for their personal documents.
"My Documents" is the default folder used by Office applications for saving
the user's personal document files.
<P>
Office Setup will create the folder "My Documents" in the root of the drive
to which Office is being installed. For example, if a user installs Office
to c:\Msoffice, then Setup will create the folder "c:\My Documents" for
that user's personal documents.
<P>
If a user installs Office to a user folder on a network share, "My
Documents" will be created at the root of that share. If multiple users,
then, install Office to separate user folders on a single network share, a
single "My Documents" folder will be created at the root of that share
for all users. This can cause document sharing issues because they will all
be using the same "My Documents" folder for their personal documents.
<P>
For example, suppose two users have drive letter G mapped to the same
network server share:
<P>
<PRE>  user1 - g:  mapped to  \\Server\Share
  user2 - g:  mapped to  \\Server\Share

</PRE></OL>The two users run Office Setup and install Office into subfolders of this
server share:
<P>
<PRE>  user1 - g:\User1\Msoffice  =  \\Server\Share\User1\Msoffice
  user2 - g:\User2\Msoffice  =  \\Server\Share\User2\Msoffice

</PRE>As each user runs Setup, it will create the folder "My Documents" at the
root of drive G. Because each user's drive G is mapped to the same network
location, Setup will actually create a single "My Documents" folder at the
root of the share:
<P>
<PRE>  user1 - g:\My Documents  =  \\Server\Share\My Documents
  user2 - g:\My Documents  =  \\Server\Share\My Documents

</PRE>Both users will then be using the same "My Documents" folder for their
personal documents, with each user having access to the other user's
documents.
<P>
To avoid this situation, users must be mapped directly to their own
specific subfolder on the network share. Following the previous example,
suppose each user has drive letter G mapped directly to their own subfolder
on the server share:
<P>
<PRE>  user1 - g:  mapped to  \\Server\Share\User1
  user2 - g:  mapped to  \\Server\Share\User2

</PRE>Each user then installs Office to "g:\" and Setup will create the "My
Documents" folder at the root of that drive. Because each user has mapped
drive G to a separate folder, they will each have their own "My Documents"
folder:
<P>
<PRE>  user1 - g:\My Documents  =  \\Server\Share\User1\My Documents
  user2 - g:\My Documents  =  \\Server\Share\User2\My Documents

</PRE>Before any users install Office to network locations, you need to insure
that each user is mapped to a separate folder on the network share. This
means that you need to make sure the appropriate network shares are defined
in advance, and you need to edit user login scripts where the mapping
occurs or inform users of the correct mapping procedure.
<P>
For additional information and workarounds, see chapter 8,"Installing
Microsoft Office" in the "Microsoft Office for Windows 95 Resource Kit."
See "For More Information" at the end of this file for instructions on
obtaining the resource kit.
<P>
Information on this issue can also be obtained by contacting Product
Support Services, or connecting to the support resources outlined in the
individual product helpfiles under "Getting Help", "Connect to Microsoft
technical resources."
<P>
NOTE: The section below contains incorrect information. A separate
article that discusses the documentation error is being written. For
additional information, see:
<P>

   TITLE     : Network.txt Documentation Error--Long Filenames on Novell

</PRE><h3>Support for Long Filenames on Novell 3.11</h3>
 
<P>
If the shared Office files reside on a Novell 3.11 server, then a client
installation using the Run From Network Server installation option will not
work correctly. This is due to a problem in the way Novell handles long
file names.
<P>
There is a patch available from Novell to correct this. It is in a file
called os2ptch.nam which replaces the standard Novell 3.11 file os2.nam.
<P>
Once this patch is installed on the Novell 3.11 server, make sure the long
file name feature of Windows 95 is turned on by setting the following entry
in the Windows 95 system.ini file:
<P>
<PRE> [nwredir]
 SupportLFN=2

</PRE><h3>Run From Network Server Errors on Novell 3.11</h3>
 
<P>
On some network configuration, the Run From Network Server client
installation option may fail when the Windows 95 driver for the DEC
EtherWorks Turbo / TP (DE201) network adapter is being used on a Netware
3.11 server. Some of the error messages that can occur are:

<OL><P><LI>BOOTSTRP caused a general protection fault in module SETUP.EXE.

<P><LI>The ordinal 65535 could not be located in the dynamic link library
   Kernel32.dll.

<P><LI>The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000005).
<P>
</OL>To avoid such errors, a different network adaptor should be used in the
server.
<P>
<P><h2>COPYING DISKS AND EXTRACTING FILES MANUALLY</h2>
 
<P>
Your Microsoft Office disks use a format called DMF (Distribution
Media Format), which increases the capacity of a 3.5-inch floppy
disk.
<P>
<P><h3>WARNING</h3>
 
<P>
Because DMF is a newer format, many existing utilities such as Norton Disk
Doctor, Microsoft ScanDisk, MS-DOS DiskCopy, and Microsoft Windows Copy
Disk do not recognize DMF. Do not use disk utilities to examine a DMF
formatted disk, as these utilities can corrupt the DMF disk. You cannot
copy DMF formatted disks using MS- DOS DiskCopy or Microsoft Windows Copy
Disk. For a complete discussion of DMF format, see the "Microsoft Office
for Windows 95 Resource Kit," or see, "Using Disks  with Distribution Media
Format," in the Office Readme file, OFREADME.TXT located in your Office
folder.
<P>
