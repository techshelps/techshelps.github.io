<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are two English language versions of Microsoft Office 97: the U.S.
English version and the International English version.
<P>
The only difference between the two English language versions of Microsoft
Office 97 Professional Edition for Windows is the content in Microsoft
Bookshelf Basics. For this reason, only Microsoft Office 97 Professional
Edition for Windows is released as a separate "International English"
version. All other differences between the U.S. English and the
International English versions are behavioral differences that are based on
the settings in the Regional Settings control panel for the system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Although there are no differences in the core feature set, some options
behave differently depending on the regional settings for your system.
<P>
The behavioral differences that are based on system regional settings for
the two English versions of Office 97 are listed as follows.
<P>
<P><h3>Installation</h3>
 
<P>
If Microsoft Office 97 is installed on a computer for which regional
settings are not configured for U.S. English, the Microsoft Office Setup
program prompts you to specify the proofing dictionary that you want to
use. After you do this, the spelling dictionary that you specified is
installed. Microsoft Office Setup prompts you whether to use the A4 paper
format or the U.S. letter paper format and installs the appropriate
templates automatically. Note that Microsoft Office includes templates that
work for both English language versions.
<P>
NOTE: If you install the English version of Microsoft Office 97 and you are
using U.S. regional settings, the prompt that asks you to specify the
proofing dictionaries and the paper format to use does not appear.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Word 97</h3>
 
<P>
When you use Microsoft Word with U.S. English regional settings, a dialog
box prompts you to specify a preferred English language "variation" and a
default paper size. Time, date, and measurement defaults are determined and
vary based on the system regional settings when you run Microsoft Word.
(For more information, see the "Installation" section.)
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel 97</h3>
 
<P>
Number formats, date formats, time formats, and measurements are based on
system regional settings.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft PowerPoint 97</h3>
 
<P>
You can install the Genigraphics Wizard &amp; GraphicsLink component only if
your system regional settings are configured for the United States or for
Canada. The Genigraphics Wizard allows you to send Microsoft PowerPoint
presentations to Genigraphics Corporation to create 35mm slides, posters,
color overheads, and prints. The Office-wide procedure of setting the
default proofing dictionary also applies to Microsoft PowerPoint. There are
no differences in templates or in clipart.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Access 97</h3>
 
<P>
No additional behavior differences that are based on regional settings
apply to Microsoft Access.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Outlook 97</h3>
 
<P>
No additional behavior differences that are based on regional settings
apply to Microsoft Access.
