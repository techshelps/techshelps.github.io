The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, versions 4.2, 4.2.1,
   4.2.1a, 4.2.1b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you restart your computer immediately after you complete a Microsoft
Office installation, you may receive either of the following error
messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Sorry, a System error occurred.
   address error
   To temporarily turn off extensions, restart and hold down the SHIFT
   key.

   -or-

   Sorry, a System error occurred.
   error type 10
   To temporarily turn off extensions, restart and hold down the SHIFT
   key.

   -or-

   Sorry, a System error occurred.
   illegal instruction
   To temporarily turn off extensions, restart and hold down the SHIFT
   key.

   -or-

   Sorry, a System error occurred.
   bus error
   To temporarily turn off extensions, restart and hold down the SHIFT
   key.

</PRE>Your only option is to click the Restart button in this dialog box.
<P>
If you then hold down the SHIFT key to disable extensions, you should be
able to reboot your computer; however, you may not have complete
functionality because extensions have been disabled.
<P>
NOTE: If you receive the last error, rebooting with the SHIFT key pressed
may not allow your computer to reboot.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive one of the error messages mentioned above if both of
the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are using a Macintosh computer running either System 7.5.2 or
   later.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You used a tool such as the Apple System 7.6 Extensions Manager, Now
   Utilities, or Conflict Catcher to disable extensions prior to running
   the Office Setup program.
<P>
</UL>When you disable extensions with the aforementioned utilities, you may
inadvertently move the following two files to the "Extensions
Disabled" folder:
<P>
<PRE>   Pre-System 7.6
   --------------

   Shared Library Manager, version 2.0
   Shared Library Manager PPC, version 2.0

   System 7.6
   ----------

   Shared Library Manager, version 2.0.1
   Shared Library Manager PPC, version 2.0.1

</PRE>Microsoft Office will install version 1.1.2 of the Shared Library Manager
extension into the Extensions folder if these two files are not present in
the Extensions folder when you run the Microsoft Office setup program. When
you try to restart your computer after you install Microsoft Office, you
may be unsuccessful because version 1.1.2 of the Shared Library Manager may
not be compatible with the System software.
<P>
NOTE: The Shared Library Manager PPC file is not present on a Macintosh
computer with a 68030 or 68040 microprocessor.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The aforementioned error messages advise you to restart your computer with
the SHIFT key pressed. In some situations, though, this may not work.
Please read the directions in the appropriate section below, depending on
whether or not pressing the SHIFT key is successful.
<P>
<P><h3>Pressing SHIFT key upon restart successfully reboots computer</h3>
 
<P>
Once your computer has rebooted without extensions, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Move the version 1.1.2 Shared Library Manager from the Extensions
   folder to the Trash.

<P><LI>Move the version 2.0.x Shared Library Manager and the version 2.0.x
   Shared Library Manager PPC from the "Extensions Disabled" folder to the
   Extensions folder.

<P><LI>Reboot your computer (without the SHIFT key pressed).
<P>
</OL><h3>Pressing SHIFT Key Upon Restart Does Not Work</h3>
 
<P>
If disabling extensions with the SHIFT key does not allow your computer to
reboot, you will have to use a separate boot disk (CD-ROM or floppy). Then,
once you have rebooted your computer from the separate boot disk, follow
steps 1-3 from above.
<P>
<PRE>   Use the following steps to boot from your CD-ROM device:

   a. Insert your Apple Macintosh CD-ROM.

   b. Restart your computer.

   c. Hold down the following key combination:

         OPTION + COMMAND + SHIFT + DELETE

   The above key combination tells your computer to ignore the SCSI ID 0
   and look for a startup device at the next SCSI location. Normally, your
   CD-ROM device is found at SCSI ID 3.

   NOTE: Make sure the CAPS LOCK key is not on when using the above key
   combination.

   NOTE: On some systems, holding the C key down boots your computer from
   the CD-ROM.

   d. Release the keys when the Happy Macintosh icon appears. If you
      continue to hold the keys down, your hard drive will not mount and
      you will need to restart and repeat steps b-d.

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you cannot find either the Shared Library Manager, version 2.0.x, or the
Shared Library Manager PPC, version 2.0.x, you may have to run the System
software installer to reinstall this component of the System software.
<P>
If you are NOT using an Updater for installing your System software, to
reinstall these two files without having to go through a complete
installation, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Start Extensions Manager.

<P><LI>In the Extensions Manager, load just the System extensions and Control
   Panels.
<P>
   NOTE: If your System software is on a compact disc, make sure that the
   appropriate CD-ROM driver is loaded in Extensions Manager.

<P><LI>Close the Extensions Manager window and restart your computer.

<P><LI>After your computer is restarted, insert either your System software
   compact disc or the System Install Disk 1, and then start the
   installer.

<P><LI>In the first window that appears, click Continue.

<P><LI>In the second window that appears, click the arrow next to
   Easy Install and then click Custom Install.

<P><LI>In the list of features to install, click the triangle next to
   Networking Software and then click AppleTalk. With System 7.6 click the
   triangle next to the Networking &amp; Connectivity and then click Open
   Transport.
<P>
   NOTE: The Shared Library Manager files install only when you select
   this option.

<P><LI>Click Install.
<P>
   If you are installing from floppy disks, you will be prompted for the
   appropriate floppy disk.

<P><LI>When the installation is complete, click Restart.
<P>
</OL>After your computer restarts, you should have both of the version 2.0.x
Shared Library Manager files in the extensions folder.
