The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.2, 4.2c, 4.3, 4.3c
</UL>

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, you may receive the
following alert message:
<P>
<PRE>   The Microsoft Office Upgrade Wizard has detected one or more Office
   4.x or 95 components on your computer. Removing these components is
   recommended and will not affect your existing data.

   Remove ALL old Office 4.x and 95 components now?

</PRE>If you click Yes, the Setup program may remove files that belong to earlier
versions of Microsoft Office from the network server. This may cause
problems for other users who continue to use the earlier versions of
Microsoft Office.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You installed Microsoft Office 97 on a computer on which an earlier
   version of Microsoft Office was installed.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The earlier version of Microsoft Office was installed from an
   administrative installation point on a network server.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You have administrative rights (this includes read, write, create,
   delete, and rename permissions) to the folder on the network server
   that contains the administrative installation of the earlier version of
   Microsoft Office.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Setup Removed the Items</h3>
 
<P>
If users of earlier versions of Microsoft Office begin receiving error
messages because files have been removed from the network server by the
Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Remove the administrative installation of Microsoft Office from the
   network server.

<P><LI>From a workstation, perform a new administrative installation of
   the earlier version of Microsoft Office to the same folder on the
   network server that contained previous administrative installation of
   Microsoft Office.
<P>
   NOTE: It is very important that you use the same folder name;
   otherwise, everyone who uses the earlier version of Microsoft Office
   may have to reinstall Microsoft Office.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Setup Has Not Yet Removed the Items</h3>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, verify that no user or
administrator has full access to the folder that contains the earlier
version of Microsoft Office. After the administrative installation of
Microsoft Office is finished, you need only read-only access to the folder
to install Microsoft Office.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Excel 97. This
problem was corrected in Microsoft Excel 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1).
<P>
For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
