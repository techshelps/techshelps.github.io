The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Macintosh, version 4.2, 4.2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are experiencing problems using Microsoft Office, as a
troubleshooting step you may want to remove and then reinstall it. If you
don't completely remove Office prior to reinstalling, in some cases the
problems you are trying to correct will not be fixed. This article explains
how to set up your machine to do a clean installation of Office. Clean
means that when you install, the setup program thinks you're installing
Office for the first time. No preferences, extensions, or component files
from Office will remain on your machine.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the following steps to perform a clean installation of Microsoft
Office 4.2.x:
<P>
WARNING: You will lose all macros, preferences, and custom dictionary
entries.
<P>
<P><h3>Remove Office</h3>
 
<P>
Method 1: Run Setup, then choose Remove All.
<P>
<PRE>          1. Double-click Microsoft Office Setup from your original
             product disks, or the shared network location from which
             you originally installed.

             This should start the installation maintenance program
             (provided a valid setup table and data file exist on your
             machine). If setup fails to run maintenance mode, please
             see the troubleshooting section at the end of this article.

          2. Click the Remove All button.

          3. Next, you may see a dialog box with the following message:

                Are you sure you want to completely remove this
                application?

             Click Continue to proceed with the removal.

             NOTE: The Remove All option does not remove every file
             Office places on your hard drive. Preferences, Fonts,
             Extensions, etc. are left untouched. To ensure a clean
             installation, remove the remaining files manually.

          4. After the removal is complete, you may see a dialog box
             with a message similar to the following:

                During your installation, Setup replaced or attempted
                to remove one or more files that were 'in use' and
                therefore couldn't be directly overwritten or
                deleted.

                These files have been moved to the Trash, and can be
                inspected or deleted at your convenience after the
                system restarts.

             Click OK to continue.

          5. Then you may see a message similar to the following:

                Your installation of Microsoft Office 4.2.x has been
                successfully removed.

             Click OK.

          To complete the process, follow the steps in Method 2.

</PRE>Method 2: Drag Microsoft Office and its support files to the trash.
<P>
<PRE>          1. Delete the Microsoft Office folder (the folder that Office
             installed) and its contents. Make sure not to delete any
             personal files stored in the folder.

          2. Delete the Microsoft folder and its contents.

          3. Remove the files listed below if still located on your
             machine.

</PRE><h3>Run Disk First Aid</h3>
 
<P>
Run the Disk First Aid utility to scan the drive to which you are
installing Office. The following steps apply to version 7.2 of Disk
First Aid. The process may vary slightly depending on which version
of Disk First Aid you are using.

<OL><P><LI>Boot your Macintosh using the Disk Tools disk or the Apple Macintosh
   CD-ROM. The Disk Tools disk and your Apple Macintosh CD-ROM are
   bootable. Bootable means there is a System Folder, located on the
   disk, that your Macintosh can use when first starting.
<P>
   If you run Disk First Aid without booting from the Disk Tools disk or
   your Apple Macintosh CD-ROM, Disk First Aid does not allow you to
   repair any problems.
<P>
   Use the following steps to boot from your CD-ROM device:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a. Insert your Apple Macintosh CD-ROM.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      b. On the Special menu, click Restart.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      c. Hold down the following key combination:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>            OPTION + COMMAND + SHIFT + DELETE

         The above key combination tells your computer to ignore SCSI
         ID 0 and look for a startup device at the next SCSI location.
         Normally, your CD-ROM device is found next at SCSI ID 3.

         NOTE: On some systems, holding the C key down boots your
         computer from the CD-ROM.

      d. Release the keys when the Happy Macintosh icon appears. If you
         continue to hold the keys down, your hard drive will not mount
         and you will need to restart.

   Use the following steps to boot from your Disk Tools Disk:

      a. Click Restart from the Special menu.

      b. Insert the Disk Tools disk into the floppy drive. If the disk
         is ejected prior to booting, push the disk back into the
         drive.

</PRE><P><LI>Make sure you have booted from the Floppy or CD-ROM. Drag the CD-ROM
   or floppy disk icon to the trash. If The Disk ejects, the floppy or
   CD-ROM was not your active system software. Repeat the process until
   your active system is the System Folder located on the floppy or CD-
   ROM disk.

<P><LI>Start Disk First Aid. Disk First Aid is found in the Utilities folder
   within your Apple Macintosh CD. If booting from Disk Tools, Disk
   First Aid is normally found on the root level of the disk.

<P><LI>Click the volume you would like to repair. Multiple volumes can be
   selected by holding down the SHIFT key.

<P><LI>Click the Repair button. Make sure that file sharing is turned off.
   If file sharing is enabled you may not be able to repair the volume.

<P><LI>When Disk First Aid is done, click Quit from the File menu.
<P>
</OL><h3>Rebuild the Desktop</h3>
 
<P>
If running System 7.5.x Perform a clean rebuild of the Desktop using
the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the Extensions Manager control panel to save a record of the
   extensions that are currently activated:
<P>
   a. Open the Extensions Manager control panel.
<P>
   b. Open the Sets pop-up menu, and choose Save Set.
<P>
   c. When the Save Set dialog box opens, type a name for your currently
<P><PRE>      selected extensions (for example, 'My Extensions'). When you close
      the dialog box, the name of your set is added to the Sets pop-up
      menu.
</PRE>
<P><LI>To turn off all extensions, open the Sets pop-up menu again and
   choose All Off.

<P><LI>Turn on Macintosh Easy Open; find it on the list and select the
   area to the left (make sure that there is a check mark beside it).

<P><LI>Restart the computer while holding down the OPTION and COMMAND keys.
   This should bring up a dialog box with a message similar to the
   following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Are you sure you want to rebuild the desktop file on the
      disk &lt;name of your hard drive&gt;?
</PRE><P>
   Release the keys and click OK.

<P><LI>When the desktop is rebuilt, click the Apple menu, and click Control
   Panels.

<P><LI>Open the Extensions Manager control panel.

<P><LI>Turn your extensions back on, click the Sets menu, and click the name
   you gave your set of extensions in step 1 (for example, 'My
   Extensions').

<P><LI>Restart your computer to activate your extension set.
<P>
</OL>If running an older version of System 7, follow step 4.
<P>
<P><h3>Reinstall Office</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Boot the machine with extensions disabled. To do this, restart the
   computer while holding down the SHIFT key. You should see the
   following message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Welcome to Macintosh.
      Extensions Off.
</PRE><P>
   Repeat step 1 until you see the Extensions Off message.
<P>
   NOTE: If installing from a network or CD-ROM, you must enable
   the appropriate drivers to gain access to those resources.
<P>
   CD-ROM
   ------
<P>
   Use Extensions Manager to enable the CD-ROM device driver. Disable all
   other Extensions, Control Panels, and System Folder items.
<P>
   NOTE: If you are running System Software versions 7.6, 7.6.1, or 8.0, do
   not disable the following extensions:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Shared Library Manager
      Shared Library Manager PPC
</PRE><P>
   If you disable these extensions while running System Software version
   7.6 and above, you may receive a System Error after you install Office.
<P>

<PRE>   TITLE     : OFF4: System Error When Restarting After Mac Office Install

</PRE><P><LI>Insert the Office installation media (CD-ROM or floppy disk 1) or go to
   the Office install location on your network.

<P><LI>Double-click the Microsoft Office Setup icon.

<P><LI>You should see a series of dialog boxes similar to the following:
<P>
   a. Welcome to Microsoft Office Setup. Click OK.
<P>
   b. Enter your Name and Organization. OK remains gray until you enter
<P><PRE>      your name. Click OK when you're ready to continue.
</PRE><P>
   c. Click OK to confirm your name and organization information.
<P>
   d. Here is your product identification number. Click OK when ready to
<P><PRE>      continue.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: After Office is installed, to access the identification number
      click the 'About...' command within any Office application.
</PRE><P>
   e. Please select a destination folder for Office. If you change the
<P><PRE>      default location, make sure to create a new folder to install
      Office. When the install folder field specifies the desired
      folder, click Setup.
</PRE><P>
   f. Choose the type of installation. The following three choices are
<P><PRE>      available: Typical, Complete/Custom, or Minimum. To make a selection,
      click the icon to the left of the installation description.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Tip: Before continuing, verify that the Install Folder location is
      correct. To modify this location, click Change folder.
</PRE><P>
   g. Select the version of Office you wish to install. The three options
<P><PRE>      are:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Microsoft Office for Power Macintosh
         Microsoft Office for Macintosh
         Microsoft Office for Macintosh and Power Macintosh

      The recommended selection for your machine should be the default. To
      change the default, click the radio button to the left of the desired
      option, then click OK.

   h. If you chose Complete/Custom, the next screen should display an
      options list. By default, all options are selected. For a complete
      installation, click Continue. To modify the installation, remove
      the X from the items you don't want to install.

      NOTE: The options list does not appear if you select a typical or
      minimum installation.

   i. Your graphs are updated automatically to Microsoft Graph 5.0. To
      automatically update your graphs, click Yes.

   j. Select the dictionary you want to install. Click the radio button
      to the left of the desired dictionary. Click OK, then setup verifies
      if adequate disk space exists. If adequate disk space is available,
      setup copies files to your hard drive.

</PRE><P><LI>After Setup is done, click Restart.
<P>
</OL><h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<P>
If setup fails to start maintenance mode, one of the following conditions
may be true:

<UL><LI>You are running Setup from a set of disks other than the set used
   to install the product originally. Obtain the original disks and run
   setup again.

<LI>Your desktop file is damaged and the Setup program cannot find the
   Microsoft Office Setup Table and Microsoft Office Setup Data files.
   Go to the rebuild the desktop section of this article and follow the
   steps to rebuild your desktop file.

<LI>Your Microsoft Office Setup Table and Microsoft Office Setup Data
   files have been moved or deleted from the Setup folder. If the
   Microsoft Office Setup Table and Microsoft Office Setup Data files
   are missing, maintenance mode does not function. If this happened to
   your machine, you must remove all Office's files by hand. For steps to
   do this, take a look at Method 2 in this article.
