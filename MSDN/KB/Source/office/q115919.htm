The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are upgrading from Microsoft Office version 3.0 on CD-ROM to
Microsoft Office version 4.2, and you have completely removed all of
the Microsoft Office version 3.0 files from your hard drive, the
Microsoft Office version 4.2 Setup program does not recognize files
in any of the following locations on the CD-ROM as valid for
upgrading
<P>
<PRE>   D:\PRODUCTS\PP3\DISK1
   D:\PRODUCTS\XL4A
   D:\

</PRE>where D is the letter of the drive that contains your CD-ROM.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To continue installing Microsoft Office version 4.2, when the Setup
program does not recognize that you have a valid application on the
CD-ROM for upgrading, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>If you are running the U.S. (domestic) version of Microsoft Office Setup
   program, you can choose the Continue button to continue installing
   Microsoft Office.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If you are running an international version of the Microsoft Office
   Setup program, change to the PRODUCTS\WW2C directory on the CD-ROM
   when the Setup program is checking for a valid program to upgrade from.
   The Setup program recognizes the Microsoft Word program files in this
   directory as valid for upgrading, and allows you to complete the
   Microsoft Office installation.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft
products listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has
been corrected in Microsoft Office version 4.3.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office setup program uses compliance checking to verify
that you are eligible to upgrade from a previous version of Microsoft
Office. There are two levels of compliance checking: strict and
lenient. Strict compliance checking prevents you from installing
Microsoft Office if you cannot verify that you are eligible to
upgrade. Lenient compliance checking searches for or requests
verification, but it does not prevent you from installing the
application if you do not provide appropriate verification.
<P>
The U.S. (domestic) versions of Microsoft Office uses lenient
compliance checking, so that you can install Microsoft Office even if
you do not provide the requested verification.
<P>
All international versions of Microsoft use strict compliance
checking. To upgrade an international version of Microsoft Office,
you must have Microsoft Office or one of the Microsoft Office
applications installed, or Disk 1 from the disk sets of one of these
applications, or the CD-ROM for a previous version of Microsoft
Office.
