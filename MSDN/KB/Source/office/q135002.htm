The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Send command to use your E-mail program to send a document
to another person, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   An error has occurred in your program. To keep working anyway, click
   Ignore and save your work in a new file. To quit this program, click
   Close.

   You will lose information you entered since your last Save.

</PRE>Note that this problem may also occur when you use the Send Mail button on
the Workgroup toolbar in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you send mail from an application if you are
using Lotus Notes release 3.30 or earlier with the TCP/IP network protocol.
<P>
This problem prevents you from sending a document, workbook, or
presentation using your Lotus Notes mail program.
<P>
This problem does not occur if you are using the Lotus cc:Mail program, or
if you use Lotus Notes with a different network protocol, such as IPX.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use a network protocol other than TCP/IP (if
possible).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you use Microsoft Excel version 7.0, Microsoft
Word version 7.0, or Microsoft PowerPoint version 7.0 and Lotus Notes
version 3.3 or earlier. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post
new information here as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information is taken from the "Lotus cc:Mail or Lotus
Notes" section in the Xlreadme.txt file (located in the folder to which you
installed Microsoft Excel):
<P>
<PRE>   There are known problems with Lotus Notes 3.3 TCP/IP network protocol
   support which are being addressed in a future version of Lotus Notes.
   These problems will prevent Microsoft Excel from sending mail through
   the current versions of 16 bit Lotus Notes when Lotus Notes is using
   TCP/IP as its network protocol. Using a protocol other than TCP/IP
   solves the problem.
