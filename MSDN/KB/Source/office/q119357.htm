                 INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS A SETUP SCRIPT?
                 =====================================

</PRE>A setup script is a set of instructions you can use to control
elements of a program's setup such as the installation type, the
default directory, the location of a program's components, and the
Program Manager group where the program's icons will appear. These
instructions are contained in a special file known as a setup table
file (STF). When used in conjunction with a quiet mode installation
(SETUP /Q), setup scripts give network administrators the ability to
automate a custom installation of an application.
<P>
CAUTION: Due to the complex nature of our applications, Microsoft will
support only limited modification of the setup table file. We cannot
guarantee that our applications will function properly if setup is
altered beyond those modifications outlined below.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>  WHAT MODIFICATIONS TO THE BACKUP COPY OF THE STF WILL PSS SUPPORT?
  ==================================================================

</PRE>As a general rule, support is limited to options that can normally be
changed by a user during a standard installation of the application.
Specifically, Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) will support
the following modifications to a BACKUP copy of the SETUP.STF file:

<UL><LI>Modification of the application's default installation type by
   changing the YES or NO values in the second column of the STF.

<LI>Modification of the default modules to be installed by changing the
   YES or NO values in the second column of the STF, provided that
   only fields already containing a YES and NO entry are changed.

<LI>Modification of the default directory that these modules will be
   installed in by changing the path in the AppSearch Object or the
   directory entries in the sixth column of the STF.

<LI>Modification of the default Program Manager group in which the
   application icons will be installed.
<P>
</UL>PSS will NOT support modification of the SETUP.INF file. Note also
that while PSS will help you modify specific lines of your STF, we
will not rewrite the entire file in order to achieve your desired
configuration.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                OVERVIEW OF THE SETUP TABLE FILE (STF)
                ======================================

</PRE>The STF is the primary tool for customizing the Setup program. The STF
specifies the installation process for each of the modes and
determines the nature, sequence, and extent of all user input. In
addition, the STF determines which options are installed, and where
they are installed.
<P>
The STF is a text file that you can edit using Microsoft Excel or any
other spreadsheet, database, or word processing program. The data
fields in this text file are delimited by tabs, and subfields are
delimited by different characters (depending on the data format).
<P>
<P><h2>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE STF?</h2>
 
<P>
The STF contains two basic sections: the header section and the object
section. Although the Setup program ignores blank lines, you should
leave one blank line between the end of the header section and the
beginning of the object section to make the STF easier to read.
<P>
<P><h3>Description of the Header Section</h3>
 
<P>
The header section of the STF contains the basic information of the
setup script--for example, this section contains the location of the
.INF file, dialog box text strings, and references to the object
section of the table. The header section contains two columns: one for
the parameter name and one for the parameter data. The following table
describes these parameters and the data that is associated with them.
<P>
<PRE>   Parameter name        Parameter data
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>   App Name              The name of the executable file for the
                         application.

   App Version           The version number of the application.

   Frame Bitmap          Reference to the .DLL file containing the
                         bitmap to be displayed in the setup frame
                         window.

   Frame Caption         The text string that will appear at the top
                         of the setup frame window.

   Dialog Caption Base   The text string that will appear as the
                         standard part of the title for most of the
                         dialog boxes. Other strings are concatenated
                         to this string.

   Usage String          The text string that will appear when the
                         user types /? at the command line.

   About Box String      The text string that will appear in the About
                         box.

   Check Modules         Applications that the Setup program will
                         check for (if these applications are running
                         they could interfere with the Setup program).

   Source Directory      The directory from which the Setup program is
                         being run.

   MSAPPS Mode           Indicates whether the shared applications will
                         be installed locally or run from the server, or
                         if the choice will be made during the workstation
                         installation.

   MSAPPS Network        Contains the server and volume name of the
   Server                location for the shared applications.  This
                         information should be in the universal naming
                         convention (UNC) format. For example:
                         \\SERVER\VOLUME.

                         If the network does not support UNC format, you
                         can substitute a logical drive letter for the
                         UNC path. However, if you do not use UNC paths,
                         shared applications will always be installed
                         locally regardless of the value in the MSAPPS
                         Mode field.

   MSAPPS Network Path   Contains the path to the shared applications.
                         This entry should be in UNC format.  For example:
                         \\SUBDIR1\SUBDIR2.

                         If the network does not support UNC, you can
                         substitute a logical drive letter for the UNC
                         path. However, if you do not use UNC paths,
                         shared applications will always be installed
                         locally regardless of the value in the MSAPPS
                         Mode field.

   INF File Name         The name of the relevant INF file.

   Setup Status          Contains the copy disincentive information
                         collected from Setup during installation.

   Maximum               This field must contain a number only
   Object ID             slightly larger than the largest number of
                         entries (ObjID) in the STF. Setup uses this
                         number to operate more efficiently.

   Admin Mode Root       This field indicates the point on the object
   Object ID             section at which an administrative mode
                         installation begins.

   Floppy Mode Root      This field indicates the point on the object
   Object ID             section at which Setup begins. (The default
                         mode is a floppy disk installation.)

   Network Mode Root     This field indicates the point on the object
   Object ID             section at which a network installation
                         begins.

   Maintenance Mode Root Indicates the point on the object section at
   Object ID             which a maintenance mode is run.

   Batch Mode Root       A batch mode installation (with minimal user
   Object ID             interaction).

   Setup Version         Version number of the current Setup toolkit.
                         Used to identify the version of the Setup
                         tool for which the current table file is
                         being generated.

</PRE><h3>Description of the Object Section</h3>
 
<P>
The object section of the STF contains the sequence and options of the
installation process as well as specific configuration information on
a line-by-line, object-by-object basis. Each line designates an object
and is made up of 15 columns. Each line provides specific data and
instructions for the Setup installation. This information is arranged
in a hierarchical fashion--that is, a given object can be a specific
installation action, an object branching to other objects and groups
of objects, or both. Of the 15 columns, only the first 12 are columns
you can edit, the remaining 3 columns are for internal use by Setup.
<P>
<PRE>   Column Object field      Description of entry type
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>   A      ObjID             A unique number, greater than 0 (zero),
                            that identifies the object. Should be in
                            increasing sequence. Valid ObjID numbers
                            depend on the object in use.

   B      Install During    Specifies whether the application at
          Batch Mode        this object line should be installed
                            during a batch mode installation. This
                            option applies only to network
                            installations and to options that are
                            normally selected by a user.

   C      Title             A text string that you want to associate
                            with an object.

   D      Description       A text string describing this object to
                            the user.

   E      Object Type       The type of object. Examples of an
                            object type are the following (note that
                            these entries are case sensitive):

                                 AppMainDlg
                                 CustomDlg
                                 OptionDlg
                                 Group
                                 CopyFile
                                 CopySection
                                 AddPathToAutoexec
                                 CustomAction

   F      Object Data       The content of this field is specific to
                            the Object Type. Setup uses this
                            information to define and run the
                            various automated and user-selectable
                            options. This field will either call
                            other objects (by referencing their
                            object IDs) or specify an installation
                            action.

   G      Bitmap ID         Resource ID number for button bitmap. A
                            second number may be specified for use
                            with an EGA driver.

   H      Vital Attribute   Indicates whether a portion of an
                            application is vital to the proper
                            functioning of the application. An empty
                            field indicates a value of "not vital."
                            If the user fails to select a vital
                            portion of the application, Setup
                            displays a warning.

   I      Shared Attribute  Indicates whether this item is shared or
                            private. An empty field indicates a
                            value of "private." If the user attempts
                            to remove a "shared" item, the Setup
                            program displays a warning.

   J      Configurable      Indicates whether the user can edit a
          Directory         directory field (yes) or is blocked from
                            editing a directory field (no). An empty
                            field indicates a &lt;no&gt; value.

   K      Destination       Identifies the destination directory for
          Directory         the files controlled by this object.
                            Each time you specify a destination
                            directory, the directory applies to all
                            objects lower on the table's
                            hierarchical structure. This entry is
                            useful because you only have to specify
                            the destination directory once for each
                            change in directory.

   L      Check Directory   Indicates whether to check a user-
                            selectable directory for earlier
                            versions of the files specified at this
                            line.

   M      Installed By      Leave this field blank. Setup inserts
                            the following information when you run
                            Setup in maintenance mode:

                                 se--Somebody else, more recent
                                 us--Setup
                                 nyi or blank--Not yet installed

   N      Install Data      Leave this field blank. Setup provides
                            necessary data for this field. Used
                            during maintenance mode.

   O      Install Directory Leave this field blank. Setup provides
                            necessary data for this field. Used
                            during maintenance mode.


                  EDITING THE BACKUP COPY OF THE STF
                  ==================================

</PRE><h2>GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR EDITING THE BACKUP COPY OF THE STF</h2>
 
<P>
The STF is a 15-column table (for more information about the columns
in the table, see the "Description of the Header Section" and the
"Description of the Object Section" sections earlier in this
Application Note. When you edit this table, you must keep these
columns intact. We recommend that you edit the STF in a spreadsheet
program such as Microsoft Excel. This type of program opens the STF in
a table format with the appropriate columns in place--having the data
in columns makes it easy to edit. However, if you do choose to edit
the STF in a text editor (such as Microsoft Write), the STF is opened
in text format (as opposed to a table format). If you edit the file in
this format, be sure to display all fields so that you can see the
tabs that separate the columns of data in the table (these tabs are
the column delimiters): being able to see these delimiters will help
you avoid deleting them. If you delete any of the tabs, your STF will
not function properly.
<P>
NOTE: Do not use MS-DOS Editor to modify the STF; this program will
make the file unusable because it will replace tabs with spaces.
<P>
<P><h3>To open the STF in Microsoft Excel 5.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel, open the STF you want to edit.

<P><LI>In the Text Import Wizard dialog box, choose the Next button until
   Step 3 Of 3 appears.

<P><LI>In the Text Import Wizard--Step 3 Of 3 dialog box, under Data
   Preview, click the second column to select it. Under Column Data
   Format, select the Text option, and choose Finish.
<P>
   CAUTION: If you do not select the text option at this step,
   Microsoft Excel will read some of the entries in your edited .STF
   file incorrectly. When this occurs, you will receive the "setup
   parse errors" error message during setup.
<P>
   NOTE: You may notice that when you edit the backup copy of the STF
   in Microsoft Excel 5.0, the file size will increase. This
   difference in size does not affect the interaction between the STF
   and the Setup program. In addition, Microsoft Excel 5.0 will add
   extra quotation marks to the SETUP.STF; these extra quotation marks
   do not affect the Setup program.
<P>
</OL><h3>To edit the STF</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Make a backup copy of the SETUP.STF file that you want to edit. For
   example, in File Manager, select the appropriate SETUP.STF, and
   choose Copy from the File menu. Rename the file &lt;MYSETUP&gt;.STF,
   where &lt;MYSETUP&gt; is the new name of your STF file.
<P>
   IMPORTANT: To receive support from PSS, you must edit only this
   backup copy of the STF. PSS does not, under any circumstances,
   support modification of the original SETUP.STF file.

<P><LI>Make the desired changes to the file (for more information about
   the types of changes you can make, see the following section,
   "Editing Specific Portions of the Backup Copy of the STF").

<P><LI>Once you finish editing the file, save it in the format in which it
   was opened (ASCII text).
<P>
</OL>If a subfield contains a character that Setup might interpret as a
delimiter (such as a space, a comma, a period, or a tab), the entire
subfield must be enclosed in quotation marks. If a subfield contains
quotation marks, you must add an additional set of quotation marks, as
in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   "Type the word ""Yes"" here."

</PRE></OL>This text string will appear in the Setup program in the following
form:
<P>
<PRE>   Type the word "Yes" here.

</PRE>Note that a data field in the STF cannot contain more than 255
characters, and a line cannot contain more than 1024 characters.
<P>
<P><h2>EDITING SPECIFIC PORTIONS OF THE BACKUP COPY OF THE STF</h2>
 
<P>
There are four basic aspects of the Setup program that you can alter
by editing the STF:

<UL><LI>The installation type

<LI>The default modules that will be installed (for a Custom
   installation type only)

<LI>The default directory that the application will be installed in

<LI>The default Program Manager group in which the application icons
   will be installed

<P><h2>USING SHORTHAND NOTATION TO SPECIFY A DESTINATION DIRECTORY</h2>
 
<P>
The STF supports use of shorthand notation to accommodate the variety
of directory names in which users may store an application or
operating system. For example, User A may install Microsoft Windows in
a directory called C:\WINDOWS, while User B may install Windows in
C:\MS_WINDOWS. You can use the shorthand notation %w to allow Setup to
determine the Windows directory for either of these two users, thus
eliminating the need for specifying exact directory locations. For
example, in the following table from the Office STF, note the use of
%w and %d in the Destination Directory column (column K).

</PRE>NOTE:
*  Due to a lack of space, columns C, D and G-J have been deleted from
<PRE>   the text version of this Application Note.

</PRE>In this example, EXCEL.INI is listed Under Object Data, and %w is
listed under Destination Directory. From the following combination of
these entries, you can get an idea of what the Setup program will do
at this line of the table:
<P>
<PRE>   Object Type      | Object Data  | Destination Directory
</PRE> 
<PRE>   DetectOlderFile  | "excel.ini"  | %w

</PRE>The Setup program interprets the above information as the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Look for EXCEL.INI in this user's Windows directory.

</PRE>The other shorthand notation in this example is %d, which is shorthand
for the destination directory. If you specify C:\MS_EXCEL in the
Object Data field (making it the directory to which Microsoft Excel is
installed), line 64 of the example reads
<P>
<PRE>   Object Type      | Object Data  | Destination Directory
</PRE> 
<PRE>   RemoveSection    | "XL4 Files"  | %d

</PRE>which the Setup program interprets as:
<P>
<PRE>   Remove Microsoft Excel 4.0 Files from C:\MS_EXCEL.

</PRE>If C:\MS_EXCEL is a new directory, this line would not need to be
executed. However, if you are installing Microsoft Excel 5.0 over
Microsoft Excel 4.0, this line is important. The following line is
also an important one:
<P>
<PRE>   Object Type      | Object Data     | Destination Directory
</PRE> 
<PRE>   RemoveSection    | "XL4 CBT Files" | %d\EXCELCBT

</PRE>This line is interpreted by the Setup program to mean the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Remove Excel 4 CBT files from C:\MS_EXCEL\ EXCELCBT.

</PRE>The following table lists the shorthand notations you can use in the
STF.
<P>
<PRE>   Value              Meaning
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>   %obj_id            Use the destination directory of a specified
                      object (for example, %1).

   %d or null         Use the destination directory of the parent.

   %m                 Use the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.

   %s                 Use the source directory.

   %w                 Use the Windows directory.

   %obj_id\&lt;subdir&gt;   Use a subdirectory of the specified object.

   %d\&lt;subdir&gt;        Use a subdirectory of the parent (for example
                      %d\WINWORD).

   %m&lt;\subdir&gt;        Use a subdirectory of the Windows SYSTEM
                      subdirectory.

   %s\&lt;subdir&gt;        Use a subdirectory of the source directory.

   %w\&lt;subdir&gt;        Use a subdirectory of the Windows directory.

   NOTE: The values %w and %m are necessary for an administrative mode
   Setup. In other modes, the values can be implied by action, and
   Setup automatically determines the correct directory.


               HOW TO DISTRIBUTE AND RUN A SETUP SCRIPT
               ========================================

</PRE>After you have created the STF, there are two basic ways you can
distribute it:

<UL><LI>Copy the script to the file server or shared volume from which you
   want users to install the application (do this if you will be
   creating one script for multiple users).
<P>
   The script can have any eight-letter name with the .STF extension.
   (You can also rename the SETUP.EXE file to have the same name as
   the script--for example, NEWSETUP.EXE. This will allow your users
   to run NEWSETUP, and it will automatically use the setup script
   file NEWSETUP.STF.)
<P>
   -or-

<LI>For each version of the script, follow the steps below to create an
   icon that you can distribute in a Microsoft Mail message or with
   any other application that can send files across a network (do this
   if you want to create multiple Setup scripts for different groups
   of users).
<P>
</UL>NOTE: When using a custom installation script, you MUST use the /q swith
(please see the table below).
<P>
<PRE>   To distribute Setup scripts using Microsoft Mail
   ------------------------------------------------

   1. In Microsoft Mail, compose your message and then choose Insert
      Object from the Edit menu.

   2. Under Object Type, select Package, and then choose the OK
      button.

   3. In the Object Packager, choose Command Line from the Edit menu.

   4. Type the full path to SETUP.EXE on the network server, and then
      choose the OK button. For example, you might type:

         \\dragon\public\msoffice\setup.exe /t myscript.stf /q

      NOTE: For information about the switches you can use in this
      command line, see the table below.

   5. To attach a Setup icon, choose the Insert Icon button.

   6. Choose the Browse button, locate SETUP.EXE in the network
      directory where your edited STF file is located, and then choose
      the OK button. Choose the OK button again.

   7. In Object Packager, choose Update from the File menu, and then
      choose Exit.

</PRE>If the network supports UNC path names, users who receive the message
can double-click the Setup script icon to install Office over the
