The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows, Service Release 1 (SR-1)
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program in maintenance mode,
click Add/Remove to add or remove components, and then select one or more
components to add or remove, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup Message
   Setup could not open the file: '&lt;path\filename&gt;'.

</PRE>If you click Retry, you receive the same error message again. If you click
Ignore, you receive the same error message, but a different file name
appears in the message. If you click Abort, you receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup is not yet complete.
   If you quit now, the product will not be installed properly.
   Quit Setup?

</PRE>If you quit Microsoft Office 97 Setup and start the Setup program again, it
does not run in maintenance mode. Instead, the program runs as if you are
installing Microsoft Office 97 for the first time.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You install Microsoft Office 97 from floppy disks or from folders that
   contain the images of floppy disks.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You download and install the Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Patch.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program and attempt to add or
   remove components by clicking Add/Remove.
<P>
</UL>The problem occurs because the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program fails to
determine the original location of files used by Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur if you uninstall Microsoft Office 97 by
running Setup and clicking Remove All.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: This Problem Has Occurred</h3>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program from
floppy disks, from a Microsoft Office 97 CD, or from a network server that
contains an administrative installation of Microsoft Office 97. After Setup
is finished, it may be necessary to reinstall the Microsoft Office 97 SR-1
Patch.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: This Problem Has Not Yet Occurred</h3>
 
<P>
To add or remove components after you install Microsoft Office 97 from
floppy disks and run the SR-1 Patch, enable a feature by editing the
Acme.lst file used by Microsoft Office 97 Setup. To do this, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use Windows Explorer to open the following folder on your hard disk:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Setup
</PRE>
<P><LI>Right-click the Acme.lst file. On the shortcut menu, click Open With.
   In the list of programs, click NOTEPAD. Clear the "Always use this
   program" check box, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Scroll down through the Acme.lst file until you see a line that
   is similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~2\OFFICE\SETUP\OFF97PRO.INF=Off97Pro.inf
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This line appears twice. You must perform steps 4 and 5 for each
   line.

<P><LI>Insert a semicolon (;) at the beginning of the line so that the line
   is similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ;C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~2\OFFICE\SETUP\OFF97PRO.INF=Off97Pro.inf
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the following new line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Off97Pro.inf=Off97Pro.inf
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save. Then, click Close on the File menu.
<P>
</OL>After you perform these steps, you do not receive any error messages when
you run the Setup program and add or remove components.
<P>
NOTE: After you perform these steps, Microsoft Office 97 is not completely
removed from your computer when you run Setup and click Remove All.
<P>
To completely remove Microsoft Office 97 from your computer, perform the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use Windows Explorer to open the following folder on your hard
   disk:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Setup
</PRE>
<P><LI>Right-click the Acme.lst file. On the shortcut menu, click Open With.
   In the list of programs, click NOTEPAD. Clear the "Always use this
   program" check box, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Scroll down through the Acme.lst file until you see a line that
   is similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ;C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~2\OFFICE\SETUP\OFF97PRO.INF=Off97Pro.inf
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This line appears twice. You must perform steps 4 and 5 for each
   line.

<P><LI>Remove the semicolon (;) from the beginning of the line so that the line
   is similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~2\OFFICE\SETUP\OFF97PRO.INF=Off97Pro.inf
</PRE>
<P><LI>Delete the following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Off97Pro.inf=Off97Pro.inf
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save. Then, click Close on the File menu.
<P>
</OL>You can run Setup and click Remove All to remove all of Microsoft Office 97
from your computer.
<P>
