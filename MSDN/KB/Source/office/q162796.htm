The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows, all editions
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, you may receive the
following error message multiple times:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup Error 932
   Object 6632
   Your Setup files may be damaged. Try restarting the Setup program from
   where you originally ran it.

</PRE>Each time the error message is displayed, the Object value changes to one
of the following:
<P>
<PRE>   6632   6633   6634   8107   8108   8109   8110   8111   8112   8113
   8114   8115   8116   11814

</PRE>Finally, you receive the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Office 97 Setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem will occur if Microsoft Office 97 Setup is using a setup table
(.stf) file that was opened, edited, and saved improperly in Microsoft
Excel. Note that it does not matter what version of Microsoft Excel you use
to modify the .stf file; the problem has to do with the .stf file itself.
<P>
For example, if you open Custom.stf in Microsoft Excel, make changes to it,
and save it, you may receive these error messages when you use Custom.stf
with Microsoft Office 97 Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, you must perform extra steps.
Please review both methods completely before proceeding with opening the
file in Excel.
<P>
<P><h3>Method1</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   1. Open the .stf file. You can open the .stf file by following the steps
      in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../SETUP/Q111248.htm">Q111248</A></B>
      TITLE     : XL: Opening/Saving STF File in Excel May Cause Setup
                  Errors

   2. After the .stf file is open, press CTRL+SHIFT+SPACEBAR to select the
      entire .stf file. Then, on the Data menu, point to Filter, and click
      AutoFilter.

   3. In cell E1, click the arrow, and then click the value "AddRegData."

   4. In cell F1, click the arrow and click Custom. In the Custom
      AutoFilter dialog box, set the following values

         Show rows where: F contains """" (four quotation marks)

      and click OK.

   5. Select all visible cells in column F.

   6. On the Edit menu, click Replace. In the Find What box, type a space,
      followed by a quotation mark ( "). In the Replace With box, type a
      quotation mark ("). Click Replace All.

   7. Select all visible cells in column F.

   8. On the Edit menu, click Replace. In the Find What box, type three
      quotation marks ("""). In the Replace With box, type two quotation
      marks (""). Click Replace All.

   9. Select all visible cells in column F.

  10. On the Edit menu, click Replace. In the Find What box, type two
      quotation marks (""). In the Replace With box, type a quotation
      mark ("). Click Replace All.

  11. On the Data menu, point to Filter, and click AutoFilter.

</PRE>You can now make any changes you want to the .stf file. When you are done,
be sure you save the .stf file as a tab-delimited text file, using the
instructions shown in Microsoft Knowledge Base article mentioned in step 1.
<P>
If you have already made changes to your .stf file and are receiving the
error messages shown in the "Symptoms" section, you can repair your .stf
file by following the steps shown in the "Workaround" section.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Steps 1 - 10 only have to be made one time. If you want to make
changes to the .stf file after using this method once, you can start with
step 11.

<OL><P><LI>Make a backup copy of the original .stf file.

<P><LI>Open the document in Microsoft Word.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Replace.
<P>
    Replace "^t " (Notice the space after the t).
    With "^t"
<P>
    Note: Do not type quotation marks.
<P>
    Click Replace All. Click Close.
<P>
    Note: ^t^w will not work because it will replace &lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;, as well as
    &lt;tab&gt;&lt;space&gt;.  You only want to replace &lt;tab&gt;&lt;space&gt;, so typing
    ^t&lt;spacebar&gt; on the Replace line, and just ^t on the With line will
    produce the desired results.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As. In the Save as type box select
    Text Only (*.txt). The File name box should have either:
<P>
    Off97Pro.stf.txt for the Office 97 Professional Edition
<P>
    -or-
<P>
    Off97Std.stf.txt for the Office 97 Standard Edition
<P>
    Click Save.

<P><LI>Quit Microsoft Word.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click
    Windows Explorer.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Options, and then click the View tab.

<P><LI>If there is a check in the "Hide file extensions for known file
    types" box, click it to clear the box. Click OK.

<P><LI>Go to the folder where the .stf file was saved.

<P><LI>Select the .stf file. Then on the File menu, click Rename.
    Delete the .txt portion of the filename so that it looks like:
<P>
    Off97Pro.stf for the Office 97 Professional Edition
<P>
    -or-
<P>
    Off97Std.stf for the Office 97 Standard Edition

<P><LI>In Microsoft Excel, open the .stf file you want to edit.

<P><LI>In the Text Import Wizard dialog box, click Next twice to proceed to
    the Step 3 of 3 dialog box.

<P><LI>In the Text Import Wizard - Step 3 Of 3 dialog box, under Data
    Preview, drag the vertical scrollbar indicator all the way down and
    drag the horizontal scrollbar indicator all the way to the right. Hold
    the SHIFT key down, and then click the last column. All of the columns
    should be selected.

<P><LI>Under Column Data Format, click the Text option, and click Finish.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you open an .stf in Microsoft Excel, the Text Import Wizard helps you
convert the file (a very large text file) into a format that Microsoft
Excel can display.
<P>
The steps used to open an .stf in an earlier version of Microsoft Office
must be altered slightly to work correctly with the setup table files for
Microsoft Office 97. Because of this, using the incorrect steps to open,
edit, and save the setup table file will result in a corrupted setup table
file, and you will receive the error messages shown in the "Symptoms"
section of this article when you run Microsoft Office 97 Setup.
