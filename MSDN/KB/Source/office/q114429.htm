The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office Professional &amp; Bookshelf, version 4.3-CD
<LI>Microsoft Office Professional, versions 4.0, 4.3, 4.3-CD

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you print a document that contains a footer or page number to a
Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 500 series printer (that is, HP DeskJet 310,
500, 500C, 520, 540c, 550C, 560C, 660 or Officejet), the footer or page
number may not be printed, even though your program displays it correctly
in print preview.
<P>
You may also receive the following error message when you try to print the
document:
<P>
<PRE>  One or more margins are set outside the printable area of the page.
  Choose the Fix button to increase the appropriate margins.

</PRE>NOTE: Printing from other Microsoft or non-Microsoft programs may result in
this same problem if the page number is positioned in the unprintable
region of the page.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the DJ500C.DRV printer driver supplied with Windows 3.1 by HP,
or any of the DESKJETC.DRV (versions 3.1, 4.0, 4.1, 5.0) printer drivers
from HP for the DeskJet 500 series printers, the bottom unprintable region
is .67 inch. In Word, the default setting for the footer and page number is
.5 inch from the bottom the paper. Therefore, in Word the footer is in the
unprintable bottom region for this printer driver.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Change the From Edge setting for the footer to .67 inch or larger. The
specific setting depends on the Deskjet series printer driver. To do this,
choose Page Setup from the File menu and select the Margins tab. Type or
select .67 or greater in the From Edge box and then choose OK.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Obtain the Deskjetc.drv printer driver version 4.0 or later from HP and
change the configuration settings of the driver. To obtain an updated HP
driver, contact the Hewlett-Packard Fulfillment Center at (303) 353-7650
or Hewlett-Packard Technical Support at (208) 323-2551.
<P>
<P>
The third-party contact information included in this article is provided
to help you find the technical support you need. This contact information
is subject to change without notice. Microsoft in no way guarantees the
accuracy of this third-party contact information.
<P>
Deskjetc.drv Readme.txt File:
<P>
The following information has been copied from the Readme.txt file
that is included with the Deskjetc.drv printer driver:
<P>
The minimum margins using the HP DeskJet 500 Series printer driver is 0.33
in. top and 0.67 in. bottom margins for all printing modes. Previous
versions of this printer driver had minimum margins of 0.5 in. for both top
and bottom margins. You may need to reformat documents created for previous
versions of this driver or restore the printer margins to the settings used
in previous versions of this driver.
<P>
To use the same print region as previous versions of the HP DeskJet Series
printer drivers, check the "Print Region" check box in the INI
Configuration program. For instructions on using the INI Configuration
program, see the section on INI file modification in this file.
<P>
NOTE: With this change, text on printed pages containing color will be
shifted up from what you see on your screen.
<P>
The printable area on a page using the HP DeskJet 500 Series printer driver
differs from the printable area allowed by DOS applications.
<P>
INI FILE MODIFICATIONS:
<P>
CAUTION: Do not change any settings in your *.INI files unless specifically
instructed to in this README.TXT to resolve an application or printing
problem. Changes to *.INI files may adversely affect your printing system.
<P>
For some application problems, the solution may involve modifying your
DESKJETC.INI, WIN.INI, or MSPUB.INI file. The HPVCNFIG.EXE file located in
your WINDOWS or WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory provides an easy method for
modifying control values in your *.INI files. To modify your INI files, do
the following steps

<OL><P><LI>Run the HPVCNFIG.EXE file from the Program Manager or File Manager.
   A dialog box will be displayed with a list of check boxes.

<P><LI>Check the check box specified in the software application note for your
   application problem.

<P><LI>Click the OK Button.
<P>
   The HPVCNFIG configuration file will modify the appropriate control
   values in your *.INI files.
<P>
   NOTE: You must restart Windows for the changes you have made to
   take effect. Make sure that you close all open documents before
   restarting Windows.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
Obtain version 2.1 of the HP DeskJet 500 series printer driver
(Hpdjet.exe).
<P>
This printer driver features a .5-inch bottom unprintable region. This
printer driver is available from the Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
by calling (425) 936-MSDL (6735), or through anonymous ftp at
ftp.microsoft.com.
<P>
The Microsoft Windows Driver Library (WDL) is also available on online
services.  For more information about the WDL, see the following articles
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN3X/Q82006.htm">Q82006</A></B>
   TITLE     : Windows Driver Library Information

</PRE></OL>The drawback to this workaround is that version 2.1 of the driver does not
support color, and you must manually turn off the Background Printing
option. (To locate this option, click Options on the Tools menu, and
then click the Print tab.)
