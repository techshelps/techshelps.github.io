4.30c-CD
WINDOWS
kbgraphic kberrmsg
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3c-CD
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Microsoft Office version 4.3c-CD, you may not be able to
insert a picture into a document using one of the Microsoft Office
applications. When you insert a picture using one of the Microsoft Office
applications, the following problems occur.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Word</h3>
 
<P>
You receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot start the graphics filter.
   (C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT\GIFIMP.FLT)

</PRE>where the filename displayed in parentheses is the name of the
graphics filter that is being used to read the picture file.
<P>
Note that if the Preview Picture check box is selected in the Picture
dialog box, you also receive this error message when you select the
picture from the File Name list.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
The Convert File dialog box appears. You do not receive an error
message, but the picture is not inserted onto your document.
<P>
Note that if the Preview Picture check box is selected in the Picture
dialog box, the Convert File dialog box also appears when you select
a picture file from the File Name list.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft PowerPoint</h3>
 
<P>
You receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Sorry, "C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT\EPSIMP.FLT" is not a valid filter. You
   should reinstall it.

</PRE>where C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT\EPSIMP.FLT is the name and location
of the graphics filter being used to read the picture file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because some of the graphic filters that are
installed when you run the Microsoft Office Setup program are still
compressed when they are copied to your computer.
<P>
The following graphic filters are still compressed after you install
Microsoft Office
<P>
<PRE>   C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT\CGMIMP.FLT
   C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT\DRWIMP.FLT
   C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT\EPSIMP.FLT
   C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT\GIFIMP.FLT
   C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT\PCXIMP.FLT
   C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT\PICTIMP.FLT
   C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT\TIFFIMP.FLT
   C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT\WPGEXP.FLT
   C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\GRPHFLT\WPGIMP.FLT

</PRE>where c:\WINDOWS is the directory that contains Microsoft Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1: Use the Extract utility, EXTRACT.EXE, to manually extract the
<PRE>          files from the Microsoft Office CAB files located in the
          SETUP.ADM directory on the Disk 1 CD. EXTRACT.EXE is located in
          the Disk1 subdirectory of the SETUP.ADM directory.

          The graphic files are located in the following directories and
          CAB files:

          Filename                 Directory
          ------------------------------------------------------

          CGMIMP.FLT               SETUP.ADM\DISK27\MSOFF27.CAB
          DRWIMP.FLT               SETUP.ADM\DISK27\MSOFF27.CAB
          EPSIMP.FLT               SETUP.ADM\DISK27\MSOFF27.CAB
          GIFIMP.FLT               SETUP.ADM\DISK27\MSOFF27.CAB
          PCXIMP.FLT               SETUP.ADM\DISK27\MSOFF27.CAB
          PICTIMP.FLT              SETUP.ADM\DISK24\MSOFF24.CAB
          TIFFIMP.FLT              SETUP.ADM\DISK27\MSOFF27.CAB
          WPGEXP.FLT               SETUP.ADM\DISK20\MSOFF20.CAB
          WPGIMP.FLT (NOTE 1)      SETUP.ADM\DISK28\MSOFF28.CAB

          To extract the files using this method, use the following steps:

          a. Copy EXTRACT.EXE to the root directory of your local hard
             drive, or to a directory that is located in the PATH statement
             in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

          b. At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following on one line. (The
             text appears on two lines due to line length limitations.)

             extract /y d:\&lt;directory&gt; /L
             c:\windows\msapps\grphflt &lt;filename&gt;

          where d: is the drive that contains the Microsoft Office Disk 1
          CD, &lt;directory&gt; is the directory and .CAB file that contains the
          graphic filter that you want to extract, c:\windows is your
          Microsoft Windows directory and &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the
          graphic filter that you want to extract. For example, to extract
          CGMIMP.FLT, type the following on one line:

             extract /y d:\setup.adm\disk27\msoff27.cab /l
             c:\windows\msapps\grphflt cgmimp.flt

          Note that you can use the /y switch to overwrite the existing
          compressed file without prompting. The space before the filename
          is required for the file to be properly extracted and overwrite
          the existing file.

          NOTE 1: WPGIMP.FLT filter begins in MSOFF28.CAB (DISK28) and
          ends in MSOFF29.CAB (DISK29). To access this filter, at the
          MS-DOS prompt, type on one line:

             extract /y d:\setup.adm\disk28\msoff28.cab /L
             c:\windows\msapps\grphflt wpgimp.flt

          The extract begins and the following prompt appears:

             Extract needs cabinet file 'msoff29.cab' from Microsoft
             Office Setup Disk 29. Please enter the path where this file
             may be found, and press enter.

          Type the following and the file will be extracted:

             d:\setup.adm\disk29

</PRE>Method 2: Using File Manager, copy the files (listed above) from the SHARED
<PRE>          directory on the Disk 1 CD.

          To copy each filter, type the folloing at a DOS prompt:
          copy d:\SHARED\&lt;filename&gt; c:\windows\msapps\grphflt

          Where d:\ is the drive that contains the Microsoft Office Disk 1
          CD, &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the filter in question, and
          c:\windows is your Microsoft Windows directory.


</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft
products listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching
