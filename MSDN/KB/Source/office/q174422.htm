<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information about the Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Patch
Update.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has released the Office 97 SR-1 Patch Update to address an
isolated problem that may occur when you update Microsoft Word 97 by using
the original Office 97 SR-1 Patch, and then save documents in Word SR-1.
Current versions of the patch do not cause this problem. For more
information about this problem, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE ID: <B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q173001</A></B>
   TITLE     : WD97: Word SR-1 Hangs During Save Operation

</PRE>If you have not yet installed any version of Office 97 SR-1 or the Office
97 SR-1 Patch, you will not be affected by this problem. You should either
download the newest SR-1 Patch or order the Enterprise Update CD. For
information about obtaining the newest version of the Office 97 SR-1 Patch
or the Enterprise Update, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1

</PRE><h3>How Do I Determine Which Version of the Patch I Am Using?</h3>
 
<P>
To determine which version of the SR-1 Patch you are running, use either of
the following methods.
<P>
Method 1:
<P>
Microsoft has released a utility file called the Office 97 SR-1 Patch
Version Checker (Patchchk.exe). This file checks your computer to determine
which version of the SR-1 Patch you should install: the Patch Update or the
full U.S. English patch. You can run the Version Checker only if the U.S.
English version of Word 97 is already installed on your computer. After you
run the version checker to determine the version of the patch you are
running, you can download and install the correct version of the SR-1 Patch
if necessary. You can download and install the Office 97 SR-1 Patch Version
Checker from the following Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/office/office/enhancements/PatchChk.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/office/office/enhancements/PatchChk.asp</A></B>

</PRE>NOTE: Because the Microsoft Web sites are constantly updated, the site
addresses may change without notice. If this occurs, link to the Microsoft
home page at the following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</A></B>

</PRE>Method 2:
<P>
If you downloaded the SR-1 Patch to the hard disk on your computer, you can
determine the version of the SR-1 Patch you are running by viewing the date
of the file. If you ran Setup from the Web site, you cannot correctly
determine the version. Note that downloading, and then running the patch is
the recommended method of using the patch.
<P>
To determine which version of the patch is installed on your computer,
use Windows Explorer to look at the date of the Sr1off97.exe patch file.
Earlier versions of the patch have a file date of 7/11/97. The current
patch has a file date of 8/21/97. If you saved the SR-1 Patch from the Web
to your hard disk, this file is located where you saved it. If you ran the
patch from the SR-1 Patch CD, locate the file on the CD.
<P>
<P><h3>How To Install the Office 97 SR-1 Patch Update</h3>
 
<P>
The Office 97 SR-1 Patch Update updates the earlier patch that was
available on the Web before 8/16/97 to the current, corrected version. You
can download and install the Office 97 SR-1 Patch Update from the following
web site:
