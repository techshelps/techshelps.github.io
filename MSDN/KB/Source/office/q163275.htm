<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use an anti-virus program to scan the files on your computer's
hard disk or to intercept files that contain viruses, your anti-virus
program may report that the Wwintl32.dll file is infected with a macro
virus. This article explains why the problem may occur.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Macro Viruses vs. Traditional Viruses</h3>
 
<P>
In order to fully understand this situation, it is important to understand
the difference between a macro virus and a traditional virus.
<P>
What Is a Macro Virus?
<P>
A macro virus is written using a program's scripting or macro language. It
is designed to copy itself from one document to the next, copying its code
into new modules in each document it infects. A macro virus cannot infect
files that are not documents, because the macro virus requires a module in
which to reside. For example, a macro virus can infect a Microsoft Word
document or a Microsoft Excel workbook. It cannot infect a program
executable or a .dll file, because modules cannot be created in these types
of files.
<P>
What Is a Traditional Virus?
<P>
A traditional virus is usually written in C, Assembler, or some other low-
level programming language. It is designed to modify the code of other
programs and executables (such as .dll files) that it encounters. A
traditional virus does not infect non-executable files such as documents
(Microsoft Word documents, Microsoft Excel workbooks, bitmaps, and so
forth).
<P>
<P><h3>Wwintl32.dll</h3>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office 97 on your computer, Setup copies the
Wwintl32.dll file to the computer's hard disk. The correct properties for
Wwintl32.dll are included in the following tables:

</PRE>My Anti-Virus Program Detected a
<P><h3>Macro Virus in Wwintl32.dll. What Should I Do?</h3>
 
<P>
An executable file such as a .dll file cannot be infected by a macro virus
like Bandung or Concept. If your anti-virus program reports that
Wwintl32.dll is infected with a macro virus, you may safely ignore the
warning.
<P>
However, you may still want to compare the properties of the Wwintl32.dll
file in your C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder with the
properties listed in the preceding table. If the properties match, your
Wwintl32.dll file is clean; if the properties do not match, use the steps
in the "Method 2: Get a New Copy of the File" section to transfer a new
copy of the file from your Microsoft Office 97 compact disc to your hard
disk.
<P>
My Anti-Virus Program Detected a
<P><h3>Traditional Virus in Wwintl32.dll. What Should I Do?</h3>
 
<P>
It is possible for a traditional virus to infect a .dll file such as
Wwintl32.dll. If your anti-virus program reports that Wwintl32.dll is
infected with such a virus, use either of the following methods:
<P>
Method 1: Disinfect the File
<P>
Use your anti-virus program to attempt to disinfect the infected file. In
addition, you should scan your entire system for other infected files.
<P>
<P>
Method 2: Get a New Copy of the File
<P>
Transfer a new copy of the file from your Microsoft Office 97 compact disc
to the computer's hard disk. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>On your desktop, double-click My Computer to start Windows Explorer.

<P><LI>Go to the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder.

<P><LI>Select the Wwintl32.dll file. On the File menu, click Delete. When you
   are prompted to confirm the deletion of the file, click Yes.

<P><LI>Place your Microsoft Office 97 compact disc in the CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>In Windows Explorer, locate the Office folder on your Microsoft Office
   97 compact disc.

<P><LI>Select the Wwintl32.dll file. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

<P><LI>Go to the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Paste.
<P>
</OL>A new copy of the file will be copied from your Microsoft Office 97 compact
disc to your hard disk. Empty your Windows Recycle Bin now to permanently
delete the damaged (or infected) file.
<P>
<P><h3>When Might I Be Warned About a Macro Virus in Wwintl32.dll?</h3>
 
<P>
If your anti-virus program is designed to scan for macro viruses, you may
be warned of a macro virus in Wwintl32.dll in the following situations:

<UL><LI>When you are running the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program.
<LI>When you start Microsoft Word 97.
<LI>When you open a document in Microsoft Word 97.
<P>
</UL>Could I Have Received a Virus from my
<P><h3>Microsoft Office 97 Compact Disc or Floppy Disks?</h3>
 
<P>
The compact disc and floppy disk editions of Microsoft Office 97 are
manufactured in a specially engineered and monitored environment that
guarantees that no viruses are present. For more information on how
Microsoft ensures virus-free software, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How Microsoft Ensures Virus-Free Software

</PRE></OL><h3>Why Anti-Virus Programs May Detect a Macro Virus in Wwintl32.dll</h3>
 
<P>
One of the functions of the Word 97 WordBasic to VBA converter is to scan
and remove macro viruses, such as Bandung and Concept, from Microsoft Word
95 documents when they are converted. As part of the virus recognition
system, a number of signatures (text strings) are built into Wwintl32.dll.
These signatures are used to recognize macro viruses.
<P>
An anti-virus program designed to scan for macro viruses may detect these
signatures inside the Wwintl32.dll file. If this occurs, the anti-virus
program may incorrectly assume that Wwintl32.dll is infected with a macro
virus. You may safely ignore any warning that Wwintl32.dll is infected with
a macro virus.
<P>
If other, non-macro viruses are detected in Wwintl32.dll, the file may in
fact be infected with a virus. In this case, use the steps shown above to
either disinfect or remove and reinstall Wwintl32.dll. You should also
allow your anti-virus program to disinfect any other infected files found
on your hard disk.
