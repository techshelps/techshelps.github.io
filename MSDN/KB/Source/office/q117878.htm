The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.0, 4.2, 4.3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
During a shared network installation of Microsoft Office versions 4.0 and
later, you may receive the following alert
<P>
<PRE>   Please note the following before continuing with a shared network
   installation: Be sure setup is using the same copy of Shared Windows the
   end users will be using and that it has write access to the Shared
   Windows directory. No users should have access to the system during the
   network installation.

</PRE>Although this alert implies that Microsoft Office can only be installed
if you are using a shared copy of Microsoft Windows, this is not the case:
using shared Windows is not a requirement for installing Microsoft Office.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The alert is designed to caution network administrators that Microsoft
Office should be installed using a shared copy of Windows in the event
that future users will run it under the same shared copy of Microsoft
Windows. The alert is necessary because certain files (such as the spelling
checker, clip art, fonts, and so on) will be installed on that shared copy
of Microsoft Windows, and users will need those files to run Microsoft
Office.
<P>
In the administrative setup (/a), the administrator will be prompted for
the location for the Microsoft Office files and for the MSAPPS
subdirectory. Specify the network drive where users will log on to start
Microsoft Office Setup. When users start setup from this directory (setup),
each user's copy of Microsoft Windows, shared or local, will be updated
correctly. If a network user is running shared Microsoft Windows and has
access to the shared SYSTEM subdirectory, files will be updated there for
all shared Microsoft Windows users.
<P>
If users do not have write access to the shared SYSTEM directory, they will
receive a copy of these files in their user directory on the server.
Neither the network user trying to do a post-administrative installation,
nor the administrator doing the administrative installation will be
prompted for the location of Microsoft Windows. Setup queries Microsoft
Windows for that information.
