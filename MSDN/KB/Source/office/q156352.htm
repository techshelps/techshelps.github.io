The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office 97, the Setup program may add information
to the PATH statement in the Autoexec.bat file. This may cause problems
with other programs that rely on information stored in the PATH variable.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Why Is Information Added to the PATH Statement?</h3>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office 97, the Setup program places all of the
programs (for example, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word) and the dynamic-
link library (.dll) files they need in a single folder on the hard disk; by
default, this folder is the Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder.
<P>
However, if you perform a Custom installation of Microsoft Office, you have
the option of choosing different folders for the Microsoft Office programs.
If you choose this option and install any of the programs into separate
folders, the Setup program adds the information to the PATH statement in
the Autoexec.bat file. Specifically, Setup adds the path to the default
file location, Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office.
<P>
Setup adds the information to the PATH statement because the Microsoft
Office programs are designed to look in the following locations for .dll
files that they need:

<UL><LI>The current folder

<LI>The Windows\System folder

<LI>The Windows folder

<LI>The folders in the PATH statement
<P>
</UL>If you move a program to a different folder, many of the .dll files
required by the program remain in the default folder. In order for a
program to find the .dll files it needs, Setup adds the path to the default
folder to the PATH variable.
<P>
For example, if you perform a Custom installation of Microsoft Office 97
and place the Office programs in the following locations:
<P>
<PRE>   Program                Location
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   Microsoft Excel        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office
   Microsoft Word         C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office
   Microsoft Access       C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Access
   Microsoft PowerPoint   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office
   Required .dll files*   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office

   * You cannot change the location for the .dll files.

</PRE>When you start Microsoft Access, it looks for the .dll files that it needs
in the following locations:

<UL><LI>The current folder (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Access)

<LI>The Windows\System folder

<LI>The Windows folder

<LI>The folders in the PATH statement
<P>
</UL>The required .dll files are not installed in the current folder, the
Windows\System folder, or the Windows folder. However, because Setup added
the path to the default folder to the PATH variable, Microsoft Access can
find the .dll files it needs.
<P>
<P><h3>How Is the New Information Added to the PATH Statement?</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the Setup program to install a program to a different folder,
Setup adds the path to the default folder to the beginning of the PATH
variable. For example, if the PATH statement is:
<P>
<PRE>   PATH=C:\Win95;C:\Win95\Command;C:\Mydata;C:\Otherapp

</PRE>The Setup program modifies the PATH statement as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   PATH=C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~4\OFFICE;C:\Win95;C:\Win95\Command;C:\Mydata;
   C:\Otherapp

</PRE>NOTE: The path to the default folder is added in the 8.3 MS-DOS naming
convention. This format minimizes the length of the PATH variable. Also,
the number following "MICROS~" may not be 4; it varies depending on what
other folders are present in the Program Files folder.
<P>
<P><h3>What Problems Might I Encounter Due to Changes in the PATH Variable?</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If the required changes to the PATH variable would cause it to exceed
   128 characters in length, you will receive the following error message
   during Setup:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The PATH statement in your Autoexec.bat file is too long for Setup to
      modify.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Before your new software will run correctly, you must edit the
      Autoexec.bat file manually to add the following folder to your PATH
      statement:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office
</PRE><P>
   If this error message is displayed, when Setup is complete, edit the
   PATH statement in the Autoexec.bat file (using Sysedit or Notepad) and
   add the required folder name to your PATH.
<P>
   NOTE: When you edit the PATH, it cannot exceed 128 characters in length.
<P>
   As an alternative, you can remove Microsoft Office 97 completely from
   the computer, and then reinstall it using the default file locations.

<P><LI>Although adding information to the PATH statement allows the Microsoft
   Office programs to find the .dll files that they need, it may cause
   problems when you use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to communicate with a
   program that is not in its default folder.
<P>
   If this is the case, add the path of the program you moved to the PATH
   statement in the Autoexec.bat file. For example, using the Microsoft
   Access case above, you would add the following information:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~4\ACCESS
</PRE><P>
   to the PATH statement. Other programs would then be able to use DDE to
   communicate with Microsoft Access.
