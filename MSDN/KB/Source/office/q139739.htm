The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Apple Macintosh System Software version 7.5.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Power Macintosh programs start slowly on certain classes of Power
Macintosh computers that run System 7.5.2 with virtual memory (VM) enabled.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you start a Power Macintosh program on a Power Macintosh that is
running System 7.5.2 with VM enabled, the Code Fragment Manager (CFM)
unnecessarily clears the cache of program code information. Because the
information must be reloaded again before the program can start, the start
up time takes longer than expected.
<P>
This problem is due to a lack of optimization between the Read Only Memory
(ROM) chips in some classes of Power Macintosh computers, most notably,
machines with a 603 or 604 processor, and the CFM that ships with System
7.5.2. This problem may also occur on a Power Macintosh computer with a 601
processor.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Apple has confirmed that this behavior is due to a problem in the Macintosh
Operating System CFM that ships with System 7.5.2. Apple has released
update 7.5.3 which includes a new CFM that will improve a program's
performance when it is started.
<P>
The update is available on the Apple World Wide Web site at
<B><A HREF="http://www.apple.com">http://www.apple.com.</A></B> or by calling Apple's toll-free support number at
(800)SOS-APPL (767-2775) for Operating System technical support. Apple
offers toll-free support to all Macintosh users in the United States, from
6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. Pacific time, Monday through Friday.

<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you start a Power Macintosh program on a Power Macintosh with VM
enabled, the system can juggle fragments of program and library code. When
VM is disabled, the system must load all the program code at start up time.
In a technique called file mapping, the system uses VM to divide the code
into segments and swap these segments into memory when they are needed.
This process results in more efficient handling of memory because only code
that is needed is swapped into memory when VM is on.

models 9500, 8500, 7500, 7200, PowerBook 190, PowerBook 5300, and the Duo
2300.
<P>
The following Macintosh models have a 603 or a 604 processor:
