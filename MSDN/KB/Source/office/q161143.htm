</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you play a movie that you recorded in Microsoft Camcorder, the movie
occupies a window instead of the full screen. If you maximize the window
that contains the movie, the movie appears to be clipped.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you record a movie in Microsoft Camcorder, and
then play the movie on a computer that uses a higher video resolution
compared to the resolution on the computer on which you recorded the file.
<P>
The movie appears in a window that is the size of the lower resolution. For
example, if you record a movie on a computer that uses a video resolution
of 640x480 pixels, and then play the movie on a computer that uses a
(higher) video resolution of 1,024x768 pixels, the movie appears in an
isolated window that is 640x480 pixels in size.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, play the movie with the same video resolution
with which you record it.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
