The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup file for Microsoft Office, Setup.stf, may be written to the
c:\Windows\System folder, rather than to the c:\Msoffice\Setup folder, as
expected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Office to a system that has a missing or corrupted
Setup.stf file, the Setup program treats the installation as a first-time
installation. If during Setup you select Custom install and select only one
component to install, the Setup.stf file is rewritten to c:\Windows\System
instead of c:\Msoffice\Setup. Additionally, when you install to a system
that has a missing or corrupt Setup.stf file, the Setup program also
rewrites the [MS Setup (ACME) Table Files] section in the Win.ini to read:
<P>
<PRE>   MSOFFICE.EXE@v4.3.0.1027(1033)=C:\windows\system\setup.stf

</PRE>At this point, the Setup.exe located in the c:\Msoffice\Setup folder is
not able to locate the .stf file and you receive an error message such as
the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup is unable to open the data file 'c:\msoffice\setup\setup.stf'

   -or-

   Processing Top Level Information Failed

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem so you have an accurate Setup.stf file, rename
any Setup.stf file associated with Office. Then, comment out the
Msoffice.exe line in the Win.ini file. To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Win.ini file in a text editor such as Notepad.

<P><LI>In the Win.ini file, put a semicolon in front of the Msoffice.exe line
   so it looks like the following text:
<P>
   [MS Setup (ACME) Table Files]
   ;MSOFFICE.EXE@v4.3.0.1027(1033)=C:\windows\system\setup.stf

<P><LI>Rerun the Setup program from the original floppy disks, and make the
   same selections as you did in the original installation.
<P>
</OL>This should write the Setup.stf file to the proper folder with the proper
information.
