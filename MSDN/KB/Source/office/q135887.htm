<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to start any of the programs listed at the beginning of
this article when there is fewer than 4 megabytes (MB) of free random
access memory (RAM), you may receive various error messages that indicate
that there is not enough memory to start the program.
<P>
For example, you may receive the following messages:
<P>
<PRE>   - Out of Memory.

   - Microsoft Excel indicates that it is unable to load RPCRT4.DLL or
     XLINTL32.DLL due to low memory.

   - Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint both indicate that they are
     unable to load MSO95.DLL due to low memory.

   - Microsoft Word indicates that there is not enough memory to load
     WWINTL32.DLL.

   - There is not enough free memory to run this program. Quit one or more
     programs, and then try again.

   - This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shutdown.
     If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

   - %1 caused a stack fault in module %2 at %3

   - &lt;application&gt; caused a stack fault in module &lt;application&gt; at
     0137:&lt;address&gt;

   - The system is dangerously low in resources! Would you like to
     terminate the following application? &lt;application name&gt;

   - An error occurred creating a file dialog. Please save presentations,
     exit, and then restart PowerPoint.

   - Unable to load "riched30.dll". You may be out of memory, out of system
     resources, or missing a .dll file.

   - The MAPI Spooler could not be started. close and then restart all
     mail-enabled applications.

   - Unable to open the Outlook window.

</PRE>The following problems may also occur:
<P>
<PRE>   - The screen is not redrawn properly or toolbar buttons disappear.

   - The program status bar or the mouse pointer flashes or flickers.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur when Microsoft Windows 95 is configured to manage
virtual memory, which is the default setting. When you attempt to start one
of the Office programs, Windows attempts to load the program into RAM. If
there is not enough RAM available, Windows attempts to make RAM available
by moving code from RAM to the hard disk (virtual memory). In low disk
space situations, Windows may not be able to claim enough hard disk space
for this operation to be successful. In this case, you may receive the
error messages described in this article.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do any of the following:

<UL><LI>Add more RAM to the computer.

<LI>Acquire more hard disk space (either by adding a larger disk drive or by
   using a disk compression utility).
<P>
</UL>As a short term solution, make more RAM available by shutting down unneeded
programs or make more disk space available by deleting unneeded files.
<P>
NOTE: The hard disk that needs to have the free space is the one Microsoft
Windows is using for Virtual Memory. Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Office
may not be installed on this hard disk.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To view virtual memory settings, use the right mouse button to click
My Computer, click Properties, and then click the Performance tab. In the
System Properties dialog box, click the Virtual Memory button in Advanced
settings.
<P>
To view available free disk space, on your desktop double-click the My
Computer icon. In the list of available drives, right-click the drive and
click Properties on the shortcut menu.
