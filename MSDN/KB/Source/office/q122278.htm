The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.2-CD, 4.3-CD, 4.3c-CD
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office Setup program from the CD, and you
use the /q switch to run a quiet mode installation (setup /q), you
receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Office Setup was not completed successfully

   -or-

   Microsoft Office and Bookshelf Setup was not completed successfully
   and Microsoft Office is not installed.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you run the Setup program located on the CD. You
cannot run a quiet mode installation from the CD itself.
<P>
Note that this is not a problem when you run the Setup program for
Microsoft Office from floppy disks.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To run a quiet mode installation of Microsoft Office on CD-ROM, first run
an administrative installation (setup /a) from the SETUP.ADM directory to
install Microsoft Office to the network server. You can then run a quiet
mode installation of Microsoft Office from the server to install Microsoft
Office to the workstation.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can create a Setup script and place it in the same network
directory as SETUP.EXE so that a customized Setup program can be run
using the appropriate command switches. You can run the Setup program
with the /q switch to run the Setup script and install Microsoft
Office without prompting for input. The /q switch is required when
you use a custom script. However, you cannot use the /q switch to run
the Setup program for the Microsoft Office versions above located on
the CD.
