<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run any of the programs included with Microsoft Office 97 and you
use a lower screen resolution (640 x 480, for example) or if you have many
windows open or if your screen is very cluttered, you may find that the
Office Assistant window is too obtrusive. You can use the information in
this article to control how and when the Office Assistant appears.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
All of the programs in Microsoft Office 97 include the Office Assistant. It
is available to help you with any questions or problems that you have. To
ask the Office Assistant a question, click its window, and then type your
question. If the Office Assistant window is not visible, click the Office
Assistant toolbar button on the standard toolbar.
<P>
By default, the Office Assistant is always visible. However, you can make
the Office Assistant appear only when you have a question by performing the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Right-click in the Office Assistant window. On the shortcut menu,
   click Options.

<P><LI>In the Assistant Capabilities section of the dialog box, there are
   a number of check boxes. Each check box has the following
   functionality:

   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   Help with wizards      If selected, the Assistant asks if you want
                          help whenever you use a Wizard.

   Display alerts         If selected, all alerts are shown in "word
                          bubbles" by the Assistant. If not selected,
                          alerts are shown in normal dialog boxes.

   Guess help topics      If selected, the Assistant guesses which help
                          topics you want to see, based on your actions.

   Respond to F1 key      If selected, pressing F1 displays the
                          Assistant and prompts you for a question. If
                          not selected, pressing F1 displays the Help
                          Topics window for the current application.

   Move when in the way   If selected, the Assistant window moves away
                          from the cursor when you are typing. If not
                          selected, the Assistant window may hide or
                          obscure what you are trying to edit.

   If you want the Assistant to display only when you need to ask a
   question, clear the "Help with wizards", "Display alerts", and "Guess
   help topics" check boxes. Make sure that the "Respond to F1 key" check
   box is selected.

</PRE><P><LI>Click OK.
