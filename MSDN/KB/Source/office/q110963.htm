The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot use a network administrative setup (SETUP /A) to install
Microsoft Office Manager (included in the Microsoft Office 4.0 Upgrade
package). Using the SETUP /A command to run either MSOFFICE.EXE or
SETUP.EXE from the network server, may produce any of the following error
messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not Open the file named: 'F:\SETUP\SETUP.INI'

   Could not open the file named: 'F:\SETUP\ACMSETUP.EX_'

   Cannot find CTR3DV.DLL

   Cannot find SETUP.LST

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A network administrative setup of an application is designed to
install a copy of the application to a network server. From a network
installation, Setup can then be run from a workstation to install the
files necessary to run the application on the workstation.
<P>
If you run the SETUP /A command from the Microsoft Office Manager disk,
included with the Microsoft Office 4.0 Upgrade, the Setup program will
appear to be successfully completed. However, when you run Setup from a
workstation, you may receive errors in the following situations when you
run the SETUP.EXE or MSOFFICE.EXE files from the server:

<UL><LI>When SETUP.EXE on the server is run from the workstation, the following
   error may appear
<P>
<P><PRE>      Could not open the file named: 'F:\SETUP\SETUP.INI'
</PRE><P>
   where F is the network drive specified during administrative setup.

<LI>If SETUP.INI is moved to the 'F:\SETUP\SETUP.INI' directory and
   SETUP.EXE is run again, the following message will be displayed
<P>
<P><PRE>      Could not open the file named: 'F:\SETUP\ACMSETUP.EX_'
</PRE><P>
   where F is the network drive specified during administrative setup.
<P>
</UL>If MSOFFICE.EXE is run from the workstation or the server, you receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find CTR3DV.DLL

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do the following.

<OL><P><LI>Create a directory on the server for the Microsoft Office Manager.

<P><LI>Copy the files from the Microsoft Office Manager disk to that directory.

<P><LI>From the workstation, log on to the network server directory created in
   step 1.

<P><LI>Run SETUP.EXE to install the Microsoft Office Manager to the
   workstation.
<P>
</OL>- or -
<P>
Have each user copy the files to a separate diskette from which they can
install and provide their own custom name and corporation information.
