</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition includes a Setup Wizard that you can
use to create a Setup program that users can run to install files for a
custom application. However, you are not licensed to redistribute all of
the files that are included with Microsoft Office.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The files that are available for distribution are specifically for
developing applications with Microsoft Access. The files available for
distribution allow you to distribute an application developed using
Microsoft Access to users who do not have Microsoft Access.
<P>
The Odeeula.txt file located in the Program Files\Microsoft Office\ODE
Tools folder contains a complete list of files available for distribution
with the Setup Wizard.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : ODE97: List of Redistributable Files for the ODE

</PRE>If you develop an application that makes use of a file that is not on the
list, anyone who uses your application must already have Microsoft Office
installed for your application to function properly.
<P>
For example, if you develop an application that makes use of one of the
ActiveX controls provided by the Fm20.dll file, you are not licensed to
distribute the Fm20.dll file with your application. If you distribute your
application to existing users of Microsoft Office, your application works
properly because the Fm20.dll file is already installed on their computers.
<P>
NOTE: You are not licensed to redistribute the Data Access Pack
(Dataacc.exe), which is part of the Microsoft Office 97 ValuPack. However,
you are licensed to redistribute the individual drivers contained in the
Data Access Pack, which are available as optional components for
distribution in the Setup Wizard.
