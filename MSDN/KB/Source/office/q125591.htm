</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If Microsoft Excel version 4.0, Microsoft Word 5.1, and Microsoft
PowerPoint version 3.0 are installed on your computer when you run
Microsoft Office Setup, you receive four different dialog boxes asking if
you want to remove the earlier versions of these products. The questions
appear in the following order:
<P>
<PRE>   A previous version of Excel has been found by Setup. Would
   you like to remove it?

   Setup has detected previous versions of Microsoft shared
   components in your Extensions folder, for example, Spelling
   or Help.  These components are used by older versions of
   Microsoft applications, but not by Microsoft Office 4.2.
   Remove them now?

   A previous version of Word has been found by Setup. Would
   you like to remove it?

   A previous version of PowerPoint has been found by Setup.
   Would you like to remove it?

</PRE>Note that this behavior does not cause any problem with your Microsoft
Office installation. However, the question in the second dialog box may be
redundant. If you choose NOT to remove Microsoft Excel, Word, or
PowerPoint, the second question is not necessary, because you will want to
keep the application files in the Extensions folder in order to run the
previous versions of the applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office, the Setup program detects previous
versions of the Office applications that are installed on your computer
and asks if you want to remove them. Removing these files allows you to
free up disk space on your computer.
