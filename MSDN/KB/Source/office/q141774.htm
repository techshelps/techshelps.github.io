<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Microsoft Office Setup in maintenance mode from a server
location that uses long file names (longer than eight characters with a
three-character extension), the Setup program may fail. If you start
Setup under this condition, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   There is insufficient memory or disk space to run Setup. Setup needs
   about 900kb of free disk space. Try shutting down other applications,
   restarting Windows, or freeing some disk space.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office Setup does not support long file names. Because long
file names are not supported, the location of critical files cannot be
found and the Setup program selects the inadequate memory message even
though the real problem is the inability to locate the server file
storage location.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Maintenance mode Setup is normally run from the desktop icon, and the
server location is stored in a local file (Setup.lst) which is created at
initial setup of the local computer or workstation. Because the long file
name is not understood when the Setup is run in maintenance mode, an
error is generated. Currently there is not an appropriate error message
in the program to cover this situation. Therefore, it gives the last
message in this particular search and then prepares to exit Setup.
<P>
Setup can only be run from the main server location--even if you just
want to update the current configuration by adding or deleting a few
components. To run Setup, connect to the server, find the Setup program,
and run Setup.exe from the server location.
