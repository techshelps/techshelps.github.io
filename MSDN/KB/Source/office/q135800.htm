The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office or a Microsoft Office application to a
user folder on a network drive (for example, if you are running on a
diskless workstation), the following may occur:

<UL><LI>The folder "My Documents" is created on the root of the drive that
   contains your user folder.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because the Setup program for the Microsoft Office
applications creates a "My Documents" folder at the root of the folder to
which you install the Office application. For example, if you install
Microsoft Excel to d:\Msoffice\Excel, then the Setup program creates the
folder "My Documents" on the root to the D drive (d:\My Documents).
<P>
Because of this behavior, if you install an Office application to a user
folder on a network drive, such as f:\User1, the My Documents folder is
created on the root of the F drive (f:\My Documents). However, in this
case, the root of the F drive may contain may other user folders, so that
all of the users that install an Office application on this server will
share the "My Documents" folder.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To set up the Office applications so that each user on the network has
their own My Documents folder, each user must be mapped directly to their
own specific subfolder on the network share. Each user should have a drive
letter, for example G, mapped directly to their own subfolder on the server
share as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   user1 - g:  mapped to  \\Server\Share\User1
   user2 - g:  mapped to  \\Server\Share\User2

</PRE>Each user then installs Office to "g:\" and Setup will create the "My
Documents" folder at the root of that drive. Because each user has mapped
drive G to a separate folder, they will each have their own "My Documents"
folder:
<P>
<PRE>   user1 - g:\My Documents  =  \\Server\Share\User1\My Documents
   user2 - g:\My Documents  =  \\Server\Share\User2\My Documents

</PRE>Before any users install an Office application to a network drive, you need
to insure that each user is mapped to a separate folder on the network
share. This means that you need to make sure the appropriate network shares
are defined in advance, and you need to edit user login scripts where the
mapping occurs or inform users of the correct mapping procedure.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about this problem and how to work around it, see the
"Creating "My Documents" Folder on a Server for Multiple Users" section in
the Network.txt file, located on Setup Disk 1 of your Office application.
The Network.txt file is also located in the folder to which you install
your Office application.
