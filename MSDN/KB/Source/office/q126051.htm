The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.3c-CD
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Microsoft Office 4.3c-CD with Bookshelf and choose not to
install Microsoft Word and Microsoft Bookshelf integration, you may not be
able to enable this integration without first removing and then
reinstalling the Bookshelf component of Office in Maintenance mode of
Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>To add Word and Bookshelf integration</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Run Office setup. You can choose "Office Setup and Uninstall" from the
   Office button of the Microsoft Office Manager. Or you can open the
   Office Setup icon in the Microsoft Office group. Or you can choose Run
   from the File menu in Program Manager and type "D:\SETUP.EXE" (without
   the quotation marks). This last alternative assumes that your CD-ROM
   drive is "D" for the command line. Choose OK. This should start the
   Maintenance Mode Setup for Microsoft Office.

<P><LI>Choose Add/Remove.

<P><LI>Disable the Bookshelf component and choose Continue. Be careful not to
   disable any other options because they will also be removed. After you
   are warned that two components will be removed and are you sure, choose
   YES. Continue until setup has completed successfully.

<P><LI>After setup has completed, repeat steps 1 and 2.

<P><LI>Enable the Bookshelf component and choose Continue.

<P><LI>When you receive the "Would you like to install the Word and Bookshelf
   integration?" prompt, choose Yes.
<P>
</OL>The Word and Bookshelf integration should now be installed on your system.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office version
4.3c-CD for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Word and Bookshelf integration includes the &lt;Tip&gt; of the Day*, Define,
and Copy To Word menu commands.
<P>
*In addition to the Tip Of The Day, you now get the Quote Of The Day,
Word Of The Day, or This Day In History when you start Microsoft Word.
(This information comes from Bookshelf and is displayed in Word.) This
feature is also available from the View menu.
<P>
On the Microsoft Word short-cut menu (to bring up this menu, click the
right mouse button), there is now a Define option that will display the
definition of the word. (This information comes from Bookshelf and is
displayed in Word.) This is also available from the View menu.
<P>
The Copy To Word command will copy the text from a Bookshelf entry, paste
it into a Word document and automatically add a footnote to it. This
command is located on the Edit menu in Microsoft Bookshelf.
