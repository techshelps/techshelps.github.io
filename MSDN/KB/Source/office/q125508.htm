<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was published as part five of a five-part
series in the 1.30.94 issue of MacWeek.
<P>
<P><h2>TIPS AND TRICKS FOR MICROSOFT OFFICE VERSION 4.2</h2>
 
<P>
Dear Mac User:
<P>
This is part 5 of a five-part series on tips and tricks about
Microsoft(R) Office Standard version 4.2 (which includes Microsoft
Excel 5.0, Word 6.0, PowerPoint 4.0 and a Microsoft Mail 3.1
workstation license.) We hope you will find this information useful
as you upgrade your organization to Microsoft Office 4.2.
<P>
<PRE>                                                   - The Microsoft Mac Team

</PRE><h2>PART 5:  WORD 6.0 UPGRADE TIPS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Common Questions about Word 6.0</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word 6.0 is the most full-featured version of the most
popular word processing software ever developed for Macintosh. Word
6.0 is more than just an upgrade. It's an entirely new code base -
almost two upgrades' worth - with more than 160 improvements over
Word 5.1.
<P>
WHY DOES WORD 6.0 LOOK DIFFERENT FROM WORD 5.1? A top request of Word
5.1 users was to make Word more consistent with Microsoft Excel and
PowerPoint, and across the Macintosh and Windows operating systems.

<UL><LI>Tip: If you want to use the Word 5.1 toolbar, press CONTROL and click on
   any toolbar to access the Toolbars dialog box. Then choose the version
   5.1 toolbar.

<LI>Tip: If you want to return to the familiar "black on white" look, choose
   Options from the Tools menu, click the General tab and clear the 3D
   Dialog check box.
<P>
</UL>WHY DOES WORD 6.0 BOOT OR TYPE SLOWLY ON MY MAC? Conflicts with
various "inits" (system extensions) or a large number of installed
fonts can result in Word booting or typing slowly.

<UL><LI>Tip: Try removing fonts you don't use very often from your System
   folder.

<LI>Tip: To test if a problem is caused by an init, reboot while pressing
   the SHIFT key.

<LI>Tip: If you are a Power Macintosh user and want to insure you are using
   the native version, choose About Microsoft Word from the Apple menu. The
   Power Macintosh version will say Word 6.0 for Power Macintosh.
<P>
</UL>WHAT TOOLS ARE THERE FOR UPGRADERS FROM WORD 5.1? Word 6.0 comes with
a variety of tools and information to help users upgrade easily.

<UL><LI>Tip: The Word 5.1 upgrade template, which must be installed separately
   from the "typical" install, will add a font menu to the menu bar (like
   Word 5.1) and convert addresses from the Word 5.1 address book.

<LI>Tip:  See the Help topic "Upgrades to Word 6.0" for information on how
   to convert your Word 5.1 settings and glossary files.

<LI>Tip:  Microsoft offers a free converter so you can read Word 6.0 files
   from Word 5.1, for organizations who retain Word 5.1 on older Macintosh
   computers.
<P>
</UL><h3>What's in Word 6.0a?</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft plans to ship a maintenance release of Word 6.0 for
Macintosh in the first quarter of 1995. To be sure you're notified as
soon as it is available, make sure you return your registration card
to Microsoft. Word 6.0a will include the following:

<UL><LI>Improved boot time, especially when many fonts are installed

<LI>Solutions to common init conflict problems

<LI>Improvement for Word 5.1 to 6.0 upgraders

<LI>Improved speed of the Word Count function
<P>
</UL><h3>Word Saves You Time!</h3>
 
<P>
These new features help you save more time than ever:

<UL><LI>AutoFormat: Analyzes your document and applies formatting and styles
   automatically.

<LI>Improved Tables: You have more than 30 table formats from which to
   choose.

<LI>100 levels of undo and redo.

<LI>AutoCorrect: Your common typos can be fixed on the fly and abbreviations
   can be expanded with a press of the SPACEBAR.

<LI>Support for System 7.5 technologies:  AppleScript, PowerTalk and
   QuickDraw GX printing. A new QuickTime server improves multimedia
   capabilities for all Office 4.2 programs.
<P>
</UL><h2>CUSTOMER'S TIP</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word 6.0 is far superior to WordPerfect in its
cross-platform capabilities. You don't have to be a software expert
to perform basic functions in Word 6.0 because its user-interface is
much more user-friendly than WordPerfect. In our business, editing is
a critical component. Microsoft Word 6.0 has an impressive on-line
editing function that identifies multiple authors while enhancing the
concept of team productivity."
