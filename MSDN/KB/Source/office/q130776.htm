Programs or Use QuickDraw GX" (MC1164) is now available from Microsoft

Office4.2x Update for Power Mac extension version 1.0.1. This extension is
for use with Office 4.2 and 4.2.1 for the Power Macintosh, Word 6.0 and
6.0.1 for the Power Macintosh, and Microsoft Excel 5.0 and 5.0a for the
Power Macintosh. Installing and enabling this extension will correct the

</PRE><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
 
<P>
This Application Note includes the Office4.2x Update for Power Mac
extension version 1.0.1. This extension is for use with Office 4.2 and
4.2.1 for the Power Macintosh(TM), Word 6.0 and 6.0.1 for the Power
Macintosh, and Microsoft Excel 5.0 and 5.0a for the Power Macintosh.
Installing and enabling this extension will correct the following two
problems:

<UL><LI>Starting an application after Word causes a System Error 11 message
   and your computer stops responding (hangs).
<P>
   If you are using a Power Macintosh, you may receive a System Error
   11 message, and the computer may hang when you perform the
   following steps (note that this occurs most frequently when the
   Virtual Memory option is set to On):
<P>
   1. Start Word.
<P>
   2. Quit Word.
<P>
   3. Start another Power Mac application or restart Word.

<LI>Printing with QuickDraw GX 1.1.1 or 1.1.2 causes a System Error 11
   message and your computer hangs.
<P>
   If you are using a Power Macintosh running QuickDraw GX 1.1.1 or
   QuickDraw GX 1.1.2, you may receive a System Error 11 message and
   your computer may hang when you try to print from either Word or
   Microsoft Excel.
<P>
   NOTE: As with all extensions, the Office4.2x Update for Power Mac
   extension is not required to run Microsoft Office, and it can be
   turned off (disabled) or removed. If the extension is disabled or
   removed, the problems described here will return.
<P>
</UL><h3>INSTALLATION</h3>
 
<P>
For the Office4.2x Update for Power Mac to work, it must be installed
in the Extensions folder in the System Folder. To install the
extension, use these steps:

<OL><P><LI>If you received a disk with this Application Note, insert the disk
   in the disk drive.
<P>
   If you downloaded this Application Note from an online service,
   skip to step 2. This procedure assumes that you have already
   downloaded and extracted the compressed file.

<P><LI>Drag the Office4.2x Update for Power Mac icon to the System Folder.
<P>
   You will receive a message stating "Extensions need to be stored in
   the Extensions folder in order to be available to the Macintosh.
   Put 'Office4.2x Update for Power Mac' into the Extensions folder?"
<P>
   When you choose Yes, the System automatically places the file in
   the Extensions folder.

<P><LI>Restart the Macintosh.
<P>
</OL><h3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h3>
 

<PRE>1. Q. Are 68K Macintosh computers affected by these problems?

   A. No, the problems only affect Power Macintosh computers.
      Customers running Office applications on 68K Macintoshes do not
      need the extension.

2. Q. What is the relationship between these problems and
      virtual memory?

   A. The first problem described in the Introduction section of this
      Application Note is more likely to occur when virtual memory is
      on. There is no relationship between the QuickDraw printing
      problem and virtual memory. Nonetheless, we recommend that all
      Power Mac users running Office 4.2 or 4.2.1 for the Power
      Macintosh, Word 6.0 or 6.0.1 for the Power Macintosh, or
      Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 5.0a for the Power Macintosh install the
      extension.

3. Q. If I have QuickDraw GX 1.1.2, should I use the extension?

   A. Yes. We recommend that all Power Macintosh users running Office
      4.2 or 4.2.1 for the Power Macintosh, Word 6.0 or 6.0.1 for the
      Power Macintosh, or Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 5.0a for the Power
      Macintosh install the extension.
