</PRE><h2>INSTALLING MICROSOFT OFFICE 97</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>IMPORTANT: Disable Virus Protection Before Running Setup</h3>
 
<P>
Some virus protection programs, such as VSafe.com and Norton Anti-
Virus Autoprotect, can interfere with the Microsoft Office 97
Setup program. If you use a virus protection program on your
computer, please disable it before running Setup. (You can re-
enable the virus protection program after Setup is complete.)
Note: If your virus-detection program starts automatically when
you start Windows, you can disable it by restarting Windows while
holding down the SHIFT key.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Minimum System Requirements for Microsoft Office 97</h3>
 
<P>
To use Microsoft Office 97, you need:

<UL><LI>Personal or Multimedia computer with a 486 or higher processor.

<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 operating system or Windows NT Workstation
   3.51 with Service Pack 5 or later (will not run on earlier
   versions).

<LI>For use on Windows 95: 8 MB of memory required to run
   applications individually (12 MB required to run Microsoft
   Access); more memory may be required to run additional
   applications simultaneously.

<LI>For use on Windows NT Workstation: 16 MB of memory required to
   run applications individually; more memory may be required to
   run additional applications simultaneously.

<LI>(PROFESSIONAL EDITION) 73-191 MB of hard disk space required;
   approximately 121 MB required for typical installation,
   depending on configuration. Use the Office Upgrade Wizard
   during Setup to maximize free disk space.

<LI>(STANDARD EDITION) 60-167 MB of hard disk space required;
   approximately 102 MB required for typical installation,
   depending on configuration. Use the Office Upgrade Wizard
   during Setup to maximize free disk space.

<LI>CD-ROM drive (coupon enclosed for 3.5-inch high-density disks;
   CD-ROM contains additional items such as Microsoft Internet
   Explorer, extra clip art, fonts, .avi files, and sounds not
   available on 3.5-inch disks).

<LI>VGA or higher-resolution video adapter (Super VGA, 256-color
   recommended).

<LI>Microsoft Mouse, Microsoft IntelliMouse, or compatible pointing
   device.
<P>

   Microsoft Internet Information Server for Windows NT
   Workstation or Microsoft Personal Web Server for Windows 95.

<LI>Microsoft Exchange Server required for certain advanced
   workgroup functionality in Microsoft Outlook.

<LI>Some Internet functionality may require Internet access and
   payment of a separate fee to a service provider.
<P>
</UL><h3>Requirements for Microsoft Office 97 with Windows NT Workstation 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
To use Microsoft Office 97 with Windows NT Workstation 4.0, you
must install Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Punctuation Characters in Directory Names May Cause Problems</h3>
 
<P>
If the name of the directory you install Microsoft Office 97,
Microsoft Excel 97, Microsoft Outlook 97, Microsoft PowerPoint
97, or Microsoft Word 97 into includes a comma (,), single
quotation mark ('), or exclamation point (!), you may have
problems when you use the programs. To avoid problems, use the
default directory or use only letters and numbers in directory
names.
<P>
<P><h3>Removing the ~mssetup.t Folder After Running Setup</h3>
 
<P>
After you install Office 97, the folder ~mssetup.t may be left on
your hard disk. This folder is used temporarily by the Setup
program and may not be removed when Setup is complete. You can
safely delete this folder using My Computer or Windows Explorer.
<P>
<P><h3>Removing the Setup Shortcut for MS Internet Explorer 3.01 After Installing</h3>
 
<P>
After you install Office 97, a setup shortcut for Microsoft
Internet Explorer 3.01 is available on your Windows desktop.
After you use this shortcut to install Internet Explorer, the
shortcut remains on your Windows desktop. You can safely delete
this shortcut after installing Internet Explorer 3.01.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Plus! Themes Patch</h3>
 
<P>
The Themes switcher installed with Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95
is not compatible with the new JPEG graphics filter installed
with Office 97. If you previously installed Themes from the Plus!
Pack for Windows 95, and you installed the JPEG graphics filter
with Office 97 or Word 97, you can upgrade your existing Themes
program by getting the Microsoft Plus! Themes Patch file from
ValuPack\Patch\Themes.exe on the Office 97 CD-ROM or on the
network you installed Office from. If you didn't install Office
97 from a CD-ROM and you have access to the World Wide Web, point
to Microsoft On The Web (Help menu) in any Office program, and
then click Free Stuff.
<P>
When you have located the Themes.exe patch file, perform the
following steps to upgrade your existing Themes program.

<OL><P><LI>Locate the folder on your hard disk that contains the program file
   Themes.exe. If you installed Plus! in the default location, then
   the file Themes.exe is located in \Program Files\Plus!.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - In Windows 95, click the Windows Start button, point to Find,
      and then click Files Or Folders. Search for the file Themes.exe
      on your hard disk.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - In Windows NT Workstation, click Search on the File menu in File
      Manager, and then search for the file Themes.exe.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Delete the file Themes.exe from your hard disk.

<P><LI>Copy the Themes.exe patch file from the Office 97 CD-ROM (or that
   you downloaded from the Web) to the folder on your hard disk that
   contained the file Themes.exe.
<P>
</OL><h3>Microsoft Works 4.0a Patch</h3>
 
<P>
After installing Office 97, the default file extension for saving
files in Microsoft Works 4.0a is .htm. If you have Works 4.0a
installed on your computer, you can run the Microsoft Works 4.0a
patch file and correct the default file extension. Get the
Microsoft Works 4.0a patch file, Wks4fix.exe, from the
ValuPack\Patch folder on the Office 97 CD-ROM or on the network
you installed Office from. If you didn't install Office 97 from a
CD-ROM and you have access to the World Wide Web, point to
Microsoft On The Web (Help menu) in any Office program, and then
click Free Stuff.
<P>
<P><h3>Keeping an Existing Version of MS Access When You Install MS Office 97</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to keep your existing version of Microsoft Access on
your computer in addition to Microsoft Access 97, you can use the
Microsoft Office Upgrade Wizard located in the \ValuPack\OffClean
folder of the Microsoft Office 97 CD-ROM before you install
Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
To start the Microsoft Office Upgrade Wizard, perform one of the
following steps:

<UL><LI>In Windows Explorer or in File Manager, locate
   \ValuPack\Offclean\OffCln97.exe on the CD-ROM, and then double-
   click OffCln97.exe

<LI>In Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation 4.0, click
   Run on the Start menu, and then type
   D:\ValuPack\Offclean\OffCln97.exe

<LI>In Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 3.51, click Run on the File
   menu, and then type D:\ValuPack\Offclean\OffCln97.exe
<P>
</UL>In the Upgrade Wizard, select the Let Me Decide Which Microsoft
Office Applications Will Be Removed option. For more information
about OffCln97.exe, see Microsoft ValuPack Help (ValuPk8.hlp) in
the \ValuPack folder on the Office 97 CD-ROM.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKING WITH MICROSOFT OFFICE 97 PROGRAMS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Help Topics Graphics Don't Print Clearly</h3>
 
<P>
When you print a Help topic that contains a graphic, the graphic
may not print clearly. In particular, this occurs when you print
a topic with grayscale colors using a printer driver that does
not have options to control dithering.
<P>
<P><h3>Vendor Independent Messaging (VIM) Not Supported on Windows NT Workstation</h3>
 
<P>
If you use a 16-bit e-mail program compatible with Vendor
Independent Messaging (VIM), such as Lotus cc:Mail, on Windows NT
Workstation, you are not able to send or route documents,
workbooks, presentations, or binders in Office 97 programs.
<P>
<P><h3>Incorrect Characters in Microsoft Organization Chart on non-U.S. Systems</h3>
 
<P>
When you use the U.S. version of Microsoft Organization Chart on
a version of Windows that uses a non-ANSI character set, the
characters do not appear correctly. To show the correct
characters in Microsoft Organization Chart, select the text that
does not appear correctly, click Font on the Text menu, and then
click the correct language in the Script box.
<P>
<P><h2>MICROSOFT OFFICE 97 VALUPACK</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Office 97 ValuPack Setup May Not Be Successful Without Administrative</h3>
 
<P><h3>Permissions</h3>
 
<P>
If you use Windows NT Workstation 3.51 or later, you must be a
member of the Administrators group to install some components of
the Office 97 ValuPack.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office 97 Sounds Don't Work with Windows NT Workstation 3.51</h3>
 
<P>
The Office 97 sounds available in the Microsoft Office 97
ValuPack don't work if you use Windows NT Workstation 3.51, even
if the Provide Feedback With Sound check box is selected on the
General tab in the Options dialog box (Tools menu) in the Office
programs. Note that the sounds available with the Office
Assistant do work with Windows NT Workstation 3.51 if you have
selected the Make Sounds check box on the Options tab in the
Office Assistant dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>PRINTING</h2>

<P>
<P><h2>MICROSOFT VISUAL BASIC FOR APPLICATIONS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>New Example for Callback Property</h3>
 
<P>
The following example is a replacement for the example shown in
the Microsoft Office 97 Visual Basic Help file (VbaOff8.hlp).
<P>
This example shows an Office Assistant balloon that contains a
list of three printers. After the user clicks a printer, the
ProcessPrinter procedure runs and the balloon closes.
<P>
<PRE> Sub shar()
 Set bln = Assistant.NewBalloon
 With bln
    .Heading = "Select a Printer."
    .Labels(1).Text = "Network Printer"
    .Labels(2).Text = "Local Printer"
    .Labels(3).Text = "Local Color Printer"
    .BalloonType = msoBalloonTypeButtons
    .Mode = msoModeModeless
    .Callback = "ProcessPrinter"
    .Button = msoButtonSetNone
    .Show
 End With
 End Sub

</PRE>A callback procedure is passed three arguments: the Balloon
object whose Callback property was assigned the callback
procedure's name, the index of the label button or balloon button
the user clicked, and - if the assistant is being controlled by a
wizard - an integer that uniquely identifies that wizard.
<P>
<PRE> Sub ProcessPrinter(bln As Balloon, ibtn As Long, _
  iPriv As Long)
    Assistant.Animation = msoAnimationPrinting
    Select Case ibtn
    Case 1
        ' Insert printer-specific code
    Case 2
        ' Insert printer-specific code
    Case 3
        ' Insert printer-specific code
    End Select
 bln.Close
 End Sub

</PRE><h3>Example Using Checkboxes Property</h3>
 
<P>
It's possible for a user to select more than one check box before
clicking the OK button. If you anticipate this happening, you can
alter the code to account for it. The example below evaluates
each check box individually.
<P>
<PRE> With Assistant.NewBalloon
    .Heading = "Regional Sales Data"
    .Text = "Select the region(s) you want to print."
    For i = 1 To 3
        .CheckBoxes(i).Text = "Region " &amp; i
    Next
    .Button = msoButtonSetOkCancel
    If .Show = msoBalloonButtonOK Then
        For i = 1 To 3
            If .CheckBoxes(i).Checked = True Then
                sstring = sstring &amp; " Region " &amp; i
            End If
        Next
        MsgBox "The report will print section(s): " &amp; sstring
    Else
        MsgBox "The report will print no sections."
    End If
 End With
