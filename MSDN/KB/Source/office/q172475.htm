The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows, Service Release 1 (SR-1)
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 includes a number of updates for each program in
Microsoft Office 97. There are two versions of Microsoft Office 97 SR-1:
the SR-1 Patch and the SR-1 Enterprise Update. This article contains
information about obtaining and installing these versions of Office 97
SR-1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>SR-1 Is Available in Two Forms</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Enterprise Update is available on compact
disc and on floppy disks. The SR-1 Enterprise Update includes updated
Office 97 files and does not require that you install Microsoft Office 97
before you upgrade.
<P>
The SR-1 Patch is available on the Microsoft World Wide Web site, on
compact disc, and on floppy disks. When you run the patch, you update an
existing installation of Office 97. Note that you cannot use the patch to
update some installations of Office 97.
<P>
<P><h3>Important Note to OEM Customers</h3>
 
<P>
If you have an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) copy of Microsoft
Office 97, you cannot order disks from the Microsoft Order Desk or from
the Microsoft web site. You can only download the patch from the Microsoft
web site, or contact your OEM to see if they have Microsoft Office 97 SR-1
or the Enterprise Update available.
<P>
To determine if you have an OEM copy of Microsoft Office 97, start any of
the programs included with Microsoft Office 97 and click About on the Help
menu in the program. If the Product ID (PID) includes the letters "OEM",
you cannot order Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 floppy disks or compact discs
from Microsoft.
<P>
Items shown below that are NOT avilable to customers with OEM copies of
Microsoft Office 97 are marked with an asterisk in parentheses (*).
<P>
<P><h3>Limitations of Updating Office 97 with the Patch</h3>
 
<P>
You can use the downloadable patch to update configurations installed from
the following sources:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition for Windows (compact disc and
   floppy disks)

<LI>Microsoft Office 97 Standard Edition for Windows (compact disc and
   floppy disks)

<LI>Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition for Windows (compact disc and
   floppy disks)

<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows (compact disc and floppy disks)

<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows (compact disc and floppy disks)

<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows (compact disc and floppy disks)

<LI>Microsoft Access 97 (compact disc and floppy disks)

<LI>Microsoft Outlook (compact disc and floppy disks)
<P>
</UL>You cannot use the patch to update the following installations of Office
97:

<UL><LI>Administrative installations
<P>
   To update an administrative installation, you must create a new
   administrative installation point by using the SR-1 Enterprise Edition.
   When you run Setup from this version of Office, use the /a switch with
   the Setup command again, for example, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      setup /a
</PRE>
<LI>Run From CD-ROM installations
<P>
   To prevent problems that may occur because of mismatched dynamic link
   library (DLL) files, you cannot use the patch to update a Run From CD
   installation. If you attempt to update this kind of installation by
   using the patch, the following error message appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 has detected that office is running from a
      CDROM drive...cannot continue.
</PRE>
<LI>Run From Network Server installations
<P>
   Because you cannot use the patch to update an administrative
   installation, you cannot update a Run From Network Server installation.
   If you attempt to update this kind of installation by using the patch,
   the following error message appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      You are running from a network drive. SR-1 Patch does not support
      this... aborting.
</PRE>
<LI>Installations in which shared programs are stored on a network server
<P>
   You cannot use the patch to update a post-administrative installation in
   which you installed Office 97 from a network server, and the shared
   programs run from the network server. However, you can use the patch to
   update this kind of installation if the shared programs run on the local
   computer.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: When you use the patch, the updating process may not be completed on
computers running some configurations of Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. For the
patch to work successfully, Service Pack 2 or later must be installed on a
computer running Windows NT 4.0. In addition, if NT File System (NTFS) is
being used, the user must have administrative privileges to the computer.
<P>
