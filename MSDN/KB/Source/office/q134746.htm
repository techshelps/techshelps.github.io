The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Macintosh versions 4.2, 4.2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) that is installed with the versions of
Microsoft Office for the Macintosh and Power Macintosh listed above, can be
customized from the default settings. However, the extent of customization
varies for many of the items on the Office Manager menu.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the Microsoft Office Manager control panel window (click
Customize on the Office Manager menu), has the following items selected:

<UL><LI>Quick Start

<LI>All installed Office applications (such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft
   Word and Microsoft PowerPoint)

<LI>All of the Office components (Find File, Setup and Uninstall, Office Cue
   Cards, and Office Help)
<P>
</UL>If you installed Microsoft Office from CD, then there is also a listing for
Online Documentation and this is also selected. If there are other
Microsoft applications installed on your computer, they too will be
selected in the Microsoft Office control panel window. This list includes:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail
<LI>Microsoft FoxPro
<LI>Microsoft Works
<LI>Microsoft Project
<LI>Microsoft Schedule+
<P>
</UL>NOTE: If you did a custom setup of Microsoft Office and chose not to
install the Office Manager Optional Files, the Setup And Uninstall, Office
Cue Cards, and Office Help items will still be selected in the Office
Manager Control Panel window. However, if you try to start one these items
from the Office Manager menu, you will get an alert message asking you to
run setup and reinstall the item(s).
<P>
The following table shows the default items listed in the Office Manager
control panel window (click Customize on the Office Manager menu) and the
extent to which you can customize the items.

   Microsoft Applications                  x*                x
   Finder                                                    x
   Find File

   Applications/files added by you         x*       x        x

</PRE>Note that for the default Microsoft applications listed in the Office
Manager control panel window, when you Edit the item, you are able to
change where Office Manager looks for these applications. However, when you
Edit applications or files that you have added to Office Manager, you are
only able to change the name that is displayed on the Office Manager menu.
If you want to specify a different location for your application or file,
you must first Remove the original item from the Office Manager and then
create a new item that points to the new location.
