The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office Pro 97
<LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you run Microsoft Access on a computer that has a "Run from Network
Server" installation of Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition or
Microsoft Access 97, you may receive the following error messages when you
try to use a Wizard:
<P>
<PRE>   This feature isn't installed.

   To install this feature, rerun the Microsoft Access or Microsoft Office
   Setup program, click Add/Remove, and then click the Advanced Wizards
   check box.

</PRE>This error message appears even though the Wizards have been installed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access is installed on a network server, and the user has read-
only permissions for the \MSOffice\Workdir folder.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
All Microsoft Access users must have at least Read and Write permissions
for the Workdir folder on the server, and preferably Create and Delete
permissions also. The first person who uses a Microsoft Access Wizard must
have Create permissions for the Workdir folder so that Microsoft Access can
create the .ldb file associated with each Wizard database. After the .ldb
files are created, users no longer require Create permissions for the
Workdir folder, as long as no other user has Delete permissions for the
folder. This is because Microsoft Access will automatically delete .ldb
files if the user has permission to do so.
<P>
Note: the terms given above are correct for Novell servers.  The proper
permission term for an NT 4.0 server is Change (RWXD)(RWXD).
<P>
For more information about .ldb files, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q136128.htm">Q136128</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC: Introduction to .ldb Files (95, 97)

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Netwrk8.txt file included with Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition
and Microsoft Access 97 states the following in the "Client installation"
portion of the section titled "Installing Microsoft Office on a Network:"
<P>
<PRE>   It is recommended that users have a read-only connection to the server
   Office folder when they are running Setup, and also when they are
   running the applications after a "Run from Network Server" installation.

</PRE>This information is only partially correct. Users can have read-only
permission on the server for all folders except the Workdir folder; that
folder requires at least Read and Write permissions, and preferably Create
and Delete permissions, for all Microsoft Access users.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about installing Microsoft Office 97 Professional
Edition or Microsoft Access 97 from a network server, refer to the
Netwrk8.txt file included with the program.
