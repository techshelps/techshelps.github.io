<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a, 7.0b
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can use Briefcase, a file synchronization program in Microsoft Windows
95, with Microsoft Binders as well as with individual files. Using
Briefcase and Microsoft Binder together enables more than one user to work
on different sections of a Microsoft Binder while keeping the other
sections current.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To use a Microsoft Binder with Briefcase, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Place a Microsoft Binder file on a network where others can access it.

<P><LI>Those using the Microsoft Binder should copy it to their local
   Briefcase. Each person can then open the copy of the Microsoft Binder in
   his or her Briefcase and work on individual sections.

<P><LI>Each person working on the Binder can then update his or her copy by
   clicking Update All on the Briefcase menu. This command copies the
   individual's work to the Binder on the network and copies any changes in
   the network copy of the Microsoft Binder to that person's personal
   Briefcase.
<P>
</OL>Briefcase compares the original file with the file in Briefcase, updating
either file with the most recent version. With Microsoft Binders, Briefcase
compares sections as well. It uses the date of last change on the
corresponding sections of the two Microsoft Binders and determines when
each was edited. The options possible are the following:
<P>
<PRE>Section That Changed                 Reconciliation
----------------------------         ---------------------------------
Neither                              None

Section in Brief case                Section in Briefcase is copied over
                                     the section in the original file.

Section in the original file         Section in the original file is copied
                                     over the one in Briefcase.

Both sections                        First tries to use the application
                                     that created the section to decide
                                     how to merge the changes between the
                                     two sections. If the application can-
                                     not do this, the user is prompted to
                                     make the decision.
