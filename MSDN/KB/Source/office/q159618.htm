The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you double-click a .avi file that you created in Microsoft Camcorder,
the file will be played back, but the video may be an all-black image.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience this behavior if you installed ActiveMovie on your
computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to view a .avi file that you recorded with Camcorder, you can
either:

<UL><LI>Open your .avi file in Camcorder, and then click Play.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Make a standalone movie from your .avi file using the "Create
   Standalone Movie" feature of Microsoft Camcorder, and then run the
   standalone movie.
<P>
</UL><h3>Save a Movie as a Standalone Executable</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If your movie is not currently open in Camcorder, click Open on the File
   menu. If your movie is already open, skip steps 1 and 2.

<P><LI>In the Open dialog box, locate and select a previously recorded movie,
   and then click Open.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Create Standalone Movie.

<P><LI>In the Create Standalone Movie dialog box, select a folder in which to
   save your movie, type a name in the File Name box, and then click Save.
<P>
</OL>This will save a file with a .exe file extension in the selected folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Running a Standalone Movie</h3>
 
<P>
If you do not have Camcorder installed on your computer, you can still play
back a movie recorded (and saved as a standalone movie) by Camcorder. To
play back a standalone movie:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the .exe file that contains the standalone movie.
<P>
   When you run the .exe file, it will decompress and play back the movie
   automatically.

<P><LI>Press ESC on your keyboard or click the Stop button to stop the movie.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Camcorder is a screen-capture technology that allows easy
creation of movies. It is a simple but powerful movie recorder and play
back utility. It captures screen events, stores them as a portable file,
and allows play back. This utility enables you to create movies and save
them in an .avi file format or export them in a .exe file format. The
greatest advantage is that people who receive the .exe file can play the
movie without having Camcorder installed on their computer.
<P>
ActiveMovie enables play back of popular media formats on the Web,
including MPEG audio and video, .avi files, QuickTime, AV, .wav, MIDI, and
AIFF. ActiveMovie is not installed when you install Microsoft Office; it is
part of the ValuPack on the Microsoft Office compact disc. To install
ActiveMovie, double-click the Amovie.exe file in the \Valupack\Amovie
folder on the Microsoft Office compact disc.
