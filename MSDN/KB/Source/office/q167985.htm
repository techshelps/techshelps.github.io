The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.2, 4.2c, 4.3, 4.3c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Although Microsoft does not recommend it, it is possible to install and use
more than one version of Microsoft Office on a single computer. For
example, you can install and use both Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft
Office 7.0 on the same computer.
<P>
This article describes the problems you may encounter when you do this and
offers advice about preventing different versions of Office from
conflicting with each other.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Order of Installation</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to install and use more than one version of Microsoft Office on
a single computer, you must install the versions of Microsoft Office in
ASCENDING order. For example, if you want to use both Microsoft Office 4.x
and Microsoft Office 97 on the same computer, you must install Microsoft
Office 4.x FIRST. This step is necessary because of the way registry keys,
shared programs, and other settings are managed for each version of
Microsoft Office and for the programs that are included with each version
of Microsoft Office.
<P>
The remainder of this article assumes that you installed the versions of
Microsoft Office in the correct (ascending) order.
<P>
Using the Microsoft Office Shortcut Bar When Microsoft
Office 7.0 and Microsoft Office 97 Are Installed
 
<P>
When these two versions of Microsoft Office are both installed on the same
computer, the Microsoft Office 97 Shortcut Bar includes buttons from the
Microsoft Office 7.0 Shortcut Bar. Several of the buttons on the Microsoft
Office 7.0 Shortcut Bar were renamed in Microsoft Office 97; as a result,
the shortcut bar may contain duplicate buttons that are functionally
identical.
<P>
When both Microsoft Office 7.0 and Microsoft Office 97 are installed, the
shortcut bar may contain the following buttons.
<P>

   TITLE     : OFF97: Extra Buttons Appear on Office Shortcut Bar After
               Setup

</PRE><h3>Shortcuts on the Start Menu</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office 7.0 and Microsoft Office 97 use the same shortcuts on the
Start menu to start programs. Because of this behavior, when you install
Microsoft Office 97, the Setup program overwrites the shortcuts for
Microsoft Office 7.0 programs. The following shortcuts are affected:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Access
   Microsoft Binder
   Microsoft Excel
   Microsoft PowerPoint
   Microsoft Word

</PRE>If you rename the Microsoft Office 7.0 shortcuts before you install
Microsoft Office 97, you can use the shortcuts for both sets of programs on
the Start menu. To avoid confusion, Microsoft suggests that you add the
words "95" or "7.0" to each renamed shortcut.
<P>
You can also move the Microsoft Office 7.0 shortcuts to a subfolder on the
Start menu. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../OFFICE/Q156817.htm">Q156817</A></B>
   TITLE     : OFF97: Setup Overwrites Office 95 Start Menu Items

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Office Binder Inserts Microsoft Office 97 Documents</h3>
 
<P>
When Microsoft Office 7.0 and Microsoft Office 97 are installed on the same
computer, the Add Section dialog box in Microsoft Office Binder displays
document types for the most recently installed version of Microsoft Office.
As a result, when you insert a section, a Microsoft Office 97 document type
is used.
<P>
This behavior may cause problems when you try to share a Binder file with
users who use Microsoft Office 7.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Double-Clicking Files in Windows Explorer</h3>
 
<P>
When you double-click a Microsoft Office document in Windows Explorer,
the following rules apply:

<UL><LI>If a version of the program in which the document was created is
   running, the document is opened in that version of the program.

<LI>If no version of the program in which the document was created is
   running, the document is opened in the version of the program that you
   most recently installed UNLESS you started a version of the program
   installed with Microsoft Office 4.x (Microsoft Excel 5.x, Microsoft
   Word 6.x for Windows, Microsoft PowerPoint 4.x, or Microsoft Access
   2.x) since you installed the last version of Microsoft Office.
<P>
</UL>To reassociate documents with the programs included with a particular
version of Microsoft Office, run the Microsoft Office Setup program with
the /y and /r switches. Doing this registers the file associations for
the version of Microsoft Office. For more information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q166692.htm">Q166692</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL: Running Multiple Versions of Microsoft Excel

</PRE><h3>Inserting Microsoft Office OLE Objects into Other Programs</h3>
 
<P>
If you install multiple versions of Microsoft Office on the same computer
and you insert a Microsoft Office object (for example, a Microsoft Excel
worksheet object) into another program (for example, Microsoft Word), the
newest version of the program is used when you insert the object. This may
cause problems if you share the container file (the Microsoft Word document
that contains the Microsoft Excel worksheet object) with users who are not
using Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
<P><h3>Shared Applications</h3>
 
<P>
If you installed the versions of Microsoft Office in the correct
(ascending) order, you should not experience any problems when you use
shared programs, such as Equation Editor and Clip Gallery. Note that the
Object dialog box may display more than one entry for each shared program;
this behavior occurs because multiple versions of the shared program may be
installed on the computer.
<P>
