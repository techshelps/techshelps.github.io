listed at the beginning of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert the compact disc for Microsoft Office 97 for Windows,
Kinko's Edition, into the CD-ROM drive, the AutoRun program on the compact
disc is started, and a "Welcome to the Microsoft Office 97 trial program"
screen appears. This screen contains instructions for using the software on
the compact disc.

Two of the files that are used by the AutoRun program are Mci.vbx and
Picclip.vbx. The compact disc contains copies of Mci.vbx and Picclip.vbx
that
work with AutoRun. However, if earlier copies of Mci.vbx or Picclip.vbx are
already located on the computer, the AutoRun program may attempt to use
these
older files. If this problem occurs, you receive the error messages
described
in this article.
