<P>
This problem has been corrected by a patch for Norton Navigator for
Windows, version 1.0b. The patch may be downloaded and installed from
Symantec's web site.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Symantec's Norton Navigator for Windows 95 adds additional functionality to
Windows 95. One of the features it includes is the ability to add
additional options to shortcut menus and property dialog boxes when you are
working with files.
<P>
If you have Norton Navigator for Windows 95, version 1.0b installed on your
computer, and if you have the File Popups and Folder Popups options
enabled, right-clicking a file in any dialog box in a Microsoft Office 97
program may result in a series of error messages and (eventually) the
program will stop responding due to an invalid page fault. You will not be
able to properly shut down Windows 95. You will have to shut off your
computer or reset your computer.
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur when using Norton Navigator for Windows
95, version 1.0 or 1.0a.
<P>
Norton Navigator is manufactured by Symantec, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
