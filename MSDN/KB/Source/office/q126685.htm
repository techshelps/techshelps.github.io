The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a workstation installation of Microsoft Office, the
Microsoft Word macros, templates, letters and Wizards are incorrectly
installed to your local hard drive.
<P>
Additionally, when you perform a workstation installation of Microsoft
Office for the Power Macintosh upgrade, the files listed above from your
previous workstation installation of Microsoft Office are not removed by
the upgrade Setup program, although Microsoft Word correctly references the
files located on the network server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office Setup program incorrectly installs the macro files,
template files, wizard files, and letter files to you local hard drive
during a workstation installation.
<P>
Note that this behavior does not occur when you perform a workstation
installation of Microsoft Word standalone.
<P>
When you perform a workstation installation of Microsoft Office for the
Power Macintosh, these files are NOT copied to your local hard drive, and
are correctly referenced in Microsoft Word to be used on the network
server. However, the files installed on your local hard drive by the
previous workstation installation of Microsoft Office are not removed from
your hard drive. This behavior is by design, because the Office Setup
program cannot determine if you have modified these files.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
After you perform a workstation installation of the Microsoft Office for
the Power Macintosh upgrade, you can delete the Word files from your local
hard drive that are now being used on the server to save disk space on your
local hard drive. You will want to make sure that you haven't modified any
of these files before deleting them.
<P>
The following is a list of the Microsoft Word files that are incorrectly
installed to your local hard drive during a workstation installation of
Microsoft Office:
<P>
<PRE>   Macros (folder)
      5.1 Upgrade
      Conversion Macros
      Layout Macros
      Present It
      Table Macros
      Word 6.0 Macros
   Templates (folder)*
      (all template and wizard files)
      Letters (folder)
         (all letter files)

</PRE>* By design of Microsoft Word, the Templates folder is installed to your
local hard drive during a workstation installation of Microsoft Office or
Microsoft Word. This allows you in Microsoft Word to choose a Workgroup
Templates location (such as a folder on a network server), as well as a
User Templates location (such as a folder on your local hard drive).
<P>
Note that the Word Dialog Editor is installed by design to the local hard
drive in the Macros folder.
