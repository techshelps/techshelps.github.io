The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using the Office Assistant to speak alert text, the Office
Assistant may spell out the name of the file that appears in an alert
message letter by letter. For example, instead of speaking the following
<P>
<PRE>   Do you want to save the changes you made to Workbook1?

</PRE>the Office Assistant speaks the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Do you want to save the changes you made to W-o-r-k-b-o-o-k-one-
   apostrophe?

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You specify that you want the Office Assistant to speak alert text. To
   do this, follow these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. Click the Office Assistant. In the assistant balloon, click
       Options.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. Click the Options tab.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    3. Click to select the Speak Alert Text check box. Then, click OK.
</PRE><P>
   -and-

<LI>The name of the active file does not contain any spaces or the name
   contains words that are not recognized by the speech system, for
   example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Workbook1
      Document1
</PRE><P>
   -and-

<LI>You perform an action that causes the program to display an alert
   message that contains the name of the file. For example, you click
   Close on the File menu immediately after you change the file.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: This problem may also occur in Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh
Edition. However, it is less likely to occur because the default file name
for presentations contains a space (for example, Presentation 1).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this behavior, change the name of the file so that it includes a
space (for example, "Workbook 1" or "Document 1"). After you rename the
file, the file name is spoken correctly when the program displays an alert
message that includes the file name.
<P>
Note that words that are not recognized by the speech system are spelled
out.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the programs listed at the beginning of this
article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Office Assistant in Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition includes an
option that allows each program to speak alert messages. This option is
available only if your Macintosh computer is running Mac OS 8.0 (System
8.0) or later.
<P>
The speech system is designed to pronounce only the word it recognizes; it
cannot pronounce words that it does not recognize. When the speech system
encounters a word it does not recognize, it spells out the words, including
any punctuation that is associated with them.
