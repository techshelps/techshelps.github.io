The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you double-click a workbook, document, or presentation that is stored
on a network server or on a floppy disk, you may receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not find the application program that created the document named
   "&lt;filename&gt;".

   To open the document, select an alternate program, with or without
   translation:

</PRE>Also, the icon for the workbook, document, or presentation appears as a
generic icon that contains the letters "PC."
<P>
These problems occur even though the correct program (Microsoft Excel,
Microsoft Word, or Microsoft PowerPoint) is installed on your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The files you are trying to open were created in a program running under
   Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows NT, or any other non-Macintosh
   operating system.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The PC Exchange Preferences file on your computer does not contain the
   proper entries for the files.
<P>
   NOTE: To view the PC Exchange Preferences file, point to Control Panels
   on the Apple menu and click PC Exchange. The preferences file is missing
   the proper entries if the only item that is listed is the following:
<P>
<PRE>      .TXT   SimpleText   TEXT

</PRE></UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To correct these problems, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit all running programs and restart the computer.

<P><LI>In the Finder, open to the System Folder:Extensions folder.

<P><LI>Drag the Microsoft Structured Storage file into the trash. Then,
   click Empty Trash on the Special menu and click OK.

<P><LI>Start one of the programs that is included in Microsoft Office 98
   Macintosh Edition:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
      Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
      Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh Edition
</PRE>
<P><LI>After you start the program, quit the program.

<P><LI>On the Apple menu, point to Control Panels, and click PC Exchange.
<P>
</OL>The PC Exchange Preferences file should contain the proper entries, and the
files should be opened correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Under normal circumstances, these problems occur only if you do not have a
PC Exchange Preferences file on your computer when you install Microsoft
Office 98 Macintosh Edition. If the PC Exchange Preferences file is not
present, it cannot be updated when you install Microsoft Office; as a
result, the preferences file does not contain the proper entries.
