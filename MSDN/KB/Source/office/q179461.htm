The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows, Service Release 1 (SR-1)
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1) Patch, you
may receive the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Office 97 SR-1
   Please note: This version of the patch will function only for the
   US\English versions of Microsoft Office 97.

   -and-

   Microsoft Office 97 SR-1
   The patch has determined that your installation of Office cannot be
   updated at this time. Shut down all running applications and re-run the
   patch, if the problem persists consult the Microsoft Knowledge Base at
   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/kb">http://www.microsoft.com/kb.</A></B>

</PRE>If you open the log file created by the patch, the log file may contain two
instances of the following line of text:
<P>
<PRE>   Office files considered vital were not found (mso7enu.dll).

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the following key in the registry refers to the
incorrect folder location used by Microsoft Office:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\8.0\BinDirPath

</PRE>For example, the BinDirPath subkey may refer to the following incorrect
folder location
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office

</PRE>when it should actually refer to the following location:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office

</PRE>The SR-1 Patch uses the folder location specified by the BinDirPath subkey
to determine where certain critical files exist on the computer so that
they can be patched. If this subkey location is incorrect, the patch cannot
find the required files and the patch fails.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, correct the BinDirPath subkey in the registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
To correct the subkey, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open box, type "regedit"
   (without the quotation marks). Click OK.

<P><LI>In the registry tree, click the plus signs (+) to the left of the
   following items, in order
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
      SOFTWARE
      Microsoft
      Office
</PRE><P>
   to open the following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office
</PRE><P>

<P><LI>Select the folder labeled "8.0."

<P><LI>In the right pane, click BinDirPath. Then, click Modify on the Edit
   menu.

<P><LI>In the Value Date box, enter the correct path for Microsoft Office.
   Usually, the correct path is the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office
</PRE><P>
   Then, click OK.

<P><LI>On the Registry menu, click Exit.
<P>
</OL>After you have corrected the registry subkey, run the SR-1 Patch.
