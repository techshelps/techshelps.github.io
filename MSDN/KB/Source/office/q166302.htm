<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Find Fast Indexer is a utility that builds indexes to speed finding
documents from the Open dialog box in Microsoft Office programs and from
Microsoft Outlook. When you install Microsoft Office, a shortcut to Find
Fast is placed in your startup program group.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can open the Find Fast Control Panel icon to create additional indexes
(for example, on a network drive), delete indexes, and set other options.
Although you can use Find Fast in the Control Panel, Find Fast indexes
Office documents automatically and requires no user interaction.
<P>
By default, Find Fast creates a single index on each hard disk on your
computer. Note that Find Fast does not automatically index files on
removable disk media. However, you may create multiple indexes on a single
drive, especially on shared or network drives. You can do this but you
cannot create indexes that overlap. For example, if a Find Fast index
exists on drive C, you cannot create an additional index for files in the
My Documents folder on drive C. To create an index of My Documents, first
delete the index for drive C through the Find Fast Control Panel icon.
<P>
<P><h3>Description of the Index Files</h3>
 
<P>
Find Fast index files are located in the folder in the topmost level in the
hierarchy of indexed folders. For example, if you index an entire drive,
the index file is located at the root of that drive. Find Fast index files
are hidden files. These index files and their functions are listed in the
following table.
<P>
<PRE>   File Name             Type of File
   ---------------------------------------------------------

   Ffastun.ffl           Document list
   Ffastun.ffx           Index
   Ffastun.ffo           Cache of document properties
                         (for example, the author and title)
   Ffastun0.ffa          Status file

</PRE>Because you create and maintain index files through Find Fast in the
Control Panel, it's not necessary to work with these files directly.
<P>
NOTE: Do not attempt to copy, move, or change the attributes of these file
types. If you must delete or move a set of indexed folders, first delete
the index through the Find Fast Control Panel icon, and then recreate the
index after you move the folders.
<P>
Index files typically require about 7 percent of the space of the text
portion of the documents that are being indexed, or about 1 - 3 percent of
the total document size.
<P>
<P><h3>What Files Can Be Indexed?</h3>
 
<P>
When you specify the type of documents to index in the Create Index dialog
box, Find Fast includes the document types that are listed in the following
table.

excludes file types that do not contain text, such as BMP, COM or EXE
files.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating an Index</h3>
