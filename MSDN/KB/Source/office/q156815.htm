The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform an administrative installation ("setup /a") of Microsoft
Office 97 to a network server, the Setup program may display the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   There is not enough disk space to complete installation. You can
   change your installation options, continue installation, or exit
   Setup.

</PRE>This occurs even though there is ample free space on the hard disk to which
you are installing Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This may occur if the network server to which you are installing contains
more than 4 gigabytes (4 GB) of free space.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you receive the aforementioned error message, and you are sure that
enough space is available, click "Install Now" to continue the
administrative installation.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup from a machine running Windows
NT, the mechanism in the Setup program that calculates free disk drive
space "wraps" at every 4 GB. So, if the disk to which you are installing
Microsoft Office 97 contains more than 4 GB of free space, the Setup
program incorrectly reports the amount of free space and may even warn you
that there is not enough free space available.
<P>
For example:
<P>
<PRE>                      Free Space
   Actual             Calculated        Amount of Free Space
   Free Space         By Setup          Ignored by Setup
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   500 MB             500 MB             n/a
   2700 MB (2.7 GB)   2700 MB (2.7 GB)   n/a
   4200 MB (4.2 GB)   200 MB             4000 MB (4 GB)
   6700 MB (6.7 GB)   2700 MB (2.7 GB)   4000 MB (4 GB)
   8100 MB (8.1 GB)   100 MB             8000 MB (8 GB) (two intervals)

</PRE>If the hard disk to which you are installing has between 4 and 4.5 GB free,
or between 8 and 8.5 GB free, you may receive an error message stating that
not enough space is available. If you are sure that enough space actually
is available, click "Install Now" to override the disk space warning.
<P>
Note, this error does not occur when you perform an administrative
installation from a computer running Windows 95. However, in Windows 95,
the Setup program indicates that a maximum of 2 GB of free space is
available, even if the true amount of free space is higher.
