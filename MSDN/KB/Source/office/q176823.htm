</PRE></OL><h3>Known Issues</h3>
 
<P>
Shared Files Are Removed:
<P>
This utility removes shared system files that are installed 
by Microsoft Office 97. Because a shared file may be used by 
another program, other programs may not run correctly if a 
necessary shared file has been removed. If this problem 
occurs, reinstall the program to replace the required shared
file.
<P>
Messages Appear Under Windows NT 4.0: 
<P>
If your operating system is Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, when
you run this utility and run Microsoft Internet Explorer 
4.0, the following error message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Internet Explorer

   This page provides potentially unsafe information to an
   ActiveX Control. Your current security settings prohibit
   running controls in this manner. As a result, this page 
   may not display correctly.

</PRE>In addition, when you click one of the drives in My Computer
or in Microsoft Windows Explorer, the following error message 
may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Internet Explorer

   An ActiveX Control on this page is not safe.  Your current
   security settings prohibit running controls on this page. 
   As a result, this page may not display as intended.

</PRE>When you click OK, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Internet Explorer Script Error

   An error has occurred in the script on this page.

   Line:  78
   Char:   1

   Error: Object doesn't support this property or method.
   Code:  0

   Do you want to continue running scripts on this page?

</PRE>When you click either Yes or No, you can open any of the 
drives. However, when you open folders on the drives, 
similar error messages continue to appear.
<P>
NOTE: These error messages appear again whenever you 
restart your computer. Because this utility removes shared 
system components, the Microsoft Internet Explorer Active 
Desktop doesn't work properly. 
<P>
To correct these errors, reinstall Microsoft Internet 
Explorer 4.0.
<P>
For information about this problem with Microsoft Windows
NT 4.0 and Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, see the 
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base on the 
World Wide Web:
