    the Find window that you received from performing the above steps.

       click Rename.

    2. Rename the file to Pointer.old and close the Find window.

    2. Click Restart, and then click Yes.

       where &lt;folder&gt; is the name of the folder that contains the
       Pointer.dll.

    6. At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following and then press ENTER:

          ren pointer.dll pointer.old

    7. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to restart Windows.

    To reinstall the Pointer.dll file to your computer
    --------------------------------------------------

    1. Insert the Windows 95 compact disc into the CD-ROM drive. Or, if you
       installed Windows 95 from a floppy disk, insert Disk 9 in the disk
       drive.

    2. On the Start menu, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

    3. If the name of the folder containing the Pointer.dll does not appear
       at the MS-DOS prompt, type the following and press ENTER

         cd\&lt;folder&gt;

       where &lt;folder&gt; is the name of the folder containing the Pointer.dll.

    4. If you installed Windows 95 from a compact disc, type the following
       at the MS-DOS prompt:

         extract &lt;drive&gt;:\win95\win95_08.cab Pointer.dll

       where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of the CD-ROM drive.

         -or-

       If you installed Windows 95 from floppy disk, type the following at
       the MS-DOS prompt:

         extract &lt;drive&gt;:\win95_09.cab Pointer.dll

       where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of the floppy drive.

    5. When you finish extracting the file, type the following at the MS-
       DOS prompt, and then press ENTER:

         exit

    6. On the Start menu, click Shutdown, and then click Restart The
