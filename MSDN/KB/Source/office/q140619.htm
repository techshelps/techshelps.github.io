      utilities that facilitate better conversion between other

      The Mswrd6.exe file in the 6&amp;7conv folder contains a converter that
      allows Word 2.x for Windows to read files created by Word 6.x for the
      Macintosh, Windows, and Windows NT, and Word 7.0 for Windows 95 and
      Windows NT.

      NOTE: The files in the Glossary folder (50convrt.gly, 55convrt.gly,
      60convrt.gly) are designed to enable you to convert the contents of
      Word 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0 for MS-DOS glossary entries into AutoText
      entries in Word 7.0 for Windows 95 and Windows NT. However, a
      template file required for conversion, Msword.dot, was not included
      in the folder.

      To obtain Msword.dot, call the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561
      and request the Microsoft Word 6.0 for Windows Supplemental File
      Conversions Disks. This kit contains an Msword.dot file that you can

      For additional information, please see the following article in
      the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

         ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q107141.htm">Q107141</A></B>
         TITLE     : Word 6.0 for Windows Supplemental File Conversions
                     Disks

      The five TrueType fonts in the Wpftutil\Fonts folder improve import
      conversion of characters from WordPerfect 5.x and 6.x character sets.

      The two templates in the Wpftutil\Template folder emulate
      functionality in WordPerfect and are provided to make the transition
      easier for WordPerfect users switching to Word. The wpwin.dot
      template is for WordPerfect 5.x and 6.x for Windows users and the
      wpdos.dot template is for WordPerfect 5.1 and 6.0 for MS-DOS users.

      For detailed instructions regarding how to set up and use the

      the user for insertion on the appropriate slide. For more
      information, see Chapter 12, "Support and Troubleshooting," in the
