The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office Professional for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you perform an installation of Microsoft Office Professional for
Windows 95, the Microsoft QuickShelf 94 toolbar may appear after you
restart your computer. The folder (directory) and files for Bookshelf 94
may still be on your hard disk drive. If the QuickShelf 94 toolbar does
appear, you may still be able to access the reference material from
Microsoft Bookshelf 94.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft QuickShelf 94, by default, has either an icon in the Program
Manager StartUp group in Windows NT or a shortcut in the StartUp folder in
Windows 95--this icon is not removed when you run Office Professional for
Windows 95 Setup. In addition, the folder and files for Bookshelf 94
remain, even after you run Setup for Office Professional for Windows 95.
Therefore, you may have both Bookshelf/QuickShelf 94 and
Bookshelf/QuickShelf 95 on your computer at the same time.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To fully remove QuickShelf and Bookshelf 94 from your computer, use the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Delete the QuickShelf 1994 program item from your StartUp Group
   (in Windows NT) or the QuickShelf 1994 shortcut in your StartUp folder
   (in Windows 95).

<P><LI>If QuickShelf 94 is running, click Exit on the QuickShelf menu.

<P><LI>Delete the Bookshelf 94 folder from your computer. By default,
   Bookshelf 94 is installed into the c:\Books94 folder.
<P>
</OL>To see that QuickShelf 94 will no longer come up when you start Windows,
exit and restart Windows and the QuickShelf 94 toolbar should not appear.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
QuickShelf 94 is a floating Toolbar that appears near the title bar of your
Windows applications. When you set up Bookshelf 94, you also set up
QuickShelf 94. Setup places the QuickShelf 94 icon in your Startup group in
Windows Program Manager or in the StartUp folder in Windows 95; this means
that QuickShelf 94 will start every time you start Windows on your
computer.
<P>
QuickShelf 95 is a toolbar that is added to the Microsoft Office Shortcut
Bar when you install Bookshelf 95. By default, the QuickShelf 95 toolbar is
not visible on the Office Shortcut Bar, and if it is made visible, it will
display default buttons for the Dictionary Contents, Thesaurus Contents,
Address Builder Find, and All Books Find. In order to make the QuickShelf
95 toolbar visible on the Office Shortcut Bar, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the Office Shortcut Bar.

<P><LI>Click Customize on the Shortcut menu.

<P><LI>In the Customize dialog box, click the Toolbars tab.

<P><LI>Click the QuickShelf item and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>You should now see the QuickShelf toolbar on the Office Shortcut Bar, and
you should have the four buttons noted above displayed by default. To
display more buttons on the QuickShelf toolbar, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click the QuickShelf toolbar.

<P><LI>Click Customize on the Shortcut menu.

<P><LI>In the Customize dialog box, click the Buttons tab.

<P><LI>Click the additional button items you want displayed on the QuickShelf
   toolbar, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>Any other buttons you clicked in the Buttons tab should now be displayed on
the QuickShelf toolbar.
