The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3c-CD
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform an administrative installation (setup /a) of Microsoft
Office, some of the files, such as the graphic filter files, are not
extracted from a cabinet (.CAB) file in the SETUP.ADM directory. Instead,
they are copied from the SHARED directory on the Disk 1 CD to the SHARED
directory on the server.
<P>
This means that if you need to replace a graphic filter file on the server,
you can copy the file from the SHARED directory on the Disk 1 CD to the
SHARED subdirectory in the directory to which you installed Microsoft
Office on the server. Because these files are already decompressed, you do
not need to extract them from a .CAB file in the SETUP.ADM directory on the
Disk 1 CD.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The files in the disk subdirectories of the SETUP.ADM directory on the
Microsoft Office Disk 1 CD are stored in .CAB files. If you need to copy an
individual file from one of these .CAB files to a network server or other
permanent storage drive, you can use the copy switch (/C) with the
EXTRACT.EXE utility located in the SETUP.ADM\DISK1 subdirectory to copy the
application files to the target location.
<P>
However, the files listed below are not contained in a .CAB file in the
SETUP.ADM directory. If you need to replace any of the following files on
the server, you must copy the file from the \SHARED directory on the Disk 1
CD.
