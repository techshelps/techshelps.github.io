The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a, 7.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article outlines the steps you need to follow in order to post a
Microsoft Office document to a public folder using Microsoft Exchange
for Windows 95, version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In addition to e-mail support, Microsoft Exchange Server allows you to post
documents to public folders so you can share them with other workgroup
members.
<P>
Public folders can be configured for different types of programs, such
as bulletin boards, discussion forums, and customer tracking systems. Once
a document has been posted to a public folder, any user with access rights
to that public folder can open the document.
<P>
To enable posting capability, you must first install the Microsoft Exchange
client included with the Microsoft Exchange Server, and then install
Microsoft Office. When these programs are installed in this order, the
appropriate command for posting your Office document to a public folder is
added to the File menu for each Office program. Public folders are
available only when you have access to a Microsoft Exchange Server system.
<P>
<P><h3>In Microsoft Office 97</h3>
 
<P>
To post a Microsoft Office document to a public folder, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Log on to your Microsoft Exchange server.

<P><LI>Open the Office document that you want to share with other Microsoft
   Exchange users.

<P><LI>On the File menu, point to Send To, and then click Exchange Folder.

<P><LI>Select the public folder to receive the document.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>In Microsoft Office for Windows 95 version 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
To post a Microsoft Office document to a public folder, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Log on to your Microsoft Exchange server.

<P><LI>Open the document that you want to share with other Microsoft Exchange
   users.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click "Post to Public Folder".

<P><LI>Select the public folder to receive the document.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>When a document is in a public folder, it can be opened by multiple users
at the same time. To edit a file, such as a Microsoft Word document, you
can double-click the file to open it in the appropriate program, where you
can view, edit, or print it. If you do not have editing permission in a
public folder, items are opened with read-only permission. In this case,
you can select text, and copy and paste it into another item, but you
cannot modify the existing text.
<P>
NOTE: If you and another user open and edit an item simultaneously, the
changes made by the first user to close the document are saved. The
second user to close the item is warned that the item has changed and the
user can either discard changes or save the item in the Inbox. A conflict
message is displayed in the folder if you and the other user are accessing
the public folder from different computers.
<P>
For information about setting up Microsoft Exchange Server and making
public folders available to users, see the documentation accompanying the
Microsoft Exchange Server software.
