<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are installing Microsoft Office version 3.0 for Windows to a
network server, when you run the integrated SETUP.EXE program, the
setup may fail and you may receive one of the following error
messages:
<P>
<PRE>   File = install /resource.c, line = '99'

   -or-

   File = install /copy.c, line = '3017'

   -or-

   File copy operation failed...

   -or-

   Please report the error install /copy.c, file= '3017' to Microsoft
   Support Services.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving these error messages, use the SETUP.EXE programs
for each individual application (these setup programs should be
located in the same directory where you installed Microsoft Excel).
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office
version 3.0 for Windows. Microsoft is researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each of these errors may be caused by a damaged SETUP.INF file. If
this is the case, you need a new set of Microsoft Office disks.
<P>
However, the first two error messages are more likely to appear when
there is a problem with your destination directory. Such problems are
most likely to be encountered in network environments where drives
have been remapped by using, for example, the SUBST command or the
MAPROOT statement in Novell. The problem may occur when one of the
following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are running a shared version of Windows on your network server
   and your user WINDOWS directory is a root directory.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You are running a nonshared version of Windows and your SYSTEM
   directory is a root directory.
<P>
</UL>If the cause appears to be with the destination directory, rather
than rearrange directories or alter configurations by removing MAPROOT
statements (Novell) or SUBST commands, the best workaround is to run
the SETUP.EXE program for each individual application.
<P>
The latter error is caused when the number of bytes being written to
disk during the setup is reported incorrectly. After the Setup program
installs a file, it verifies that the file size matches the required
size listed in the SETUP.INF file. If the size doesn't match and the
file is marked nonVITAL, the Setup program returns an error message
but you have the option to continue. If the file is marked VITAL,
Setup will halt in error. The best workaround is to run the SETUP.EXE
program for each application.
<P>
<P><h3>Information Regarding Word for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
Complete instructions for a network and workstation install of Word
for Windows can be found in Appendix A of the Word for Windows User's
Guide. The general method is similar to that of Microsoft Excel. No
special switches are needed when running SETUP from the workstation to
the server or from the server to the workstation. This applies to
version 2.0 of Word for Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Information Regarding PowerPoint</h3>
 
<P>
Instructions for individually installing PowerPoint over a network can
be found in Appendix E of the MS PowerPoint Handbook. You must type
SETUP/A for a server install. You must type SETUP/N to install
PowerPoint so to run it from the workstation. To do a complete local
install from the server, you must follow different directions in
"Providing Network Access for Local PowerPoint Installation" in
Appendix E of the "MS PowerPoint Handbook."
<P>
<P><h3>Information Regarding Access</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access version 1.1 is included with Microsoft Office
Professional and is not part of the integrated setup. It must be
installed separately. You can find information about a server install
of Access in Appendix D of the "Microsoft Access User's Guide" and in
the README.TXT file that is on disk 1 of Access. Windows 3.1 or higher
is required for Access version 1.1.
