<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Microsoft Office, the Custom.dic file may be located in
the Msapps\Proof folder in your Windows folder instead of in the Program
Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Proof folder.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you already have a Custom.dic file located in the Msapps\Proof folder
from a previous version of Microsoft Office or a Microsoft Office
application, the Office version 7.0 Setup program does not create a new
Custom.dic file or location. This is so you can use the same Custom.dic
file, with all the words that you have added, to check spelling in your
documents.
<P>
Additionally, the Custom.dic file is created in the Msapps\Proof folder
if
you are running a shared Windows installation when you run Microsoft
Office
Setup.
<P>
When you run Microsoft Office Setup with a local Microsoft Windows
installation, if you do not already have a Custom.dic file on your
computer, the Custom.dic file is created in the Proof folder in the
Program
Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared folder (the same folder that contains
the other shared applications). However, if you are running a shared
Windows installation, the Custom.dic file is created in the Msapps\Proof
folder in your Windows folder instead.
<P>
This behavior occurs because with a shared Windows installation, you have
write access to the Msapps\Proof folder in the Windows folder (where
Windows is your home folder). It is necessary to have write access to the
folder that contains your Custom.dic file so that you can add words to
your
custom dictionary.
