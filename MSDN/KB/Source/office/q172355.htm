The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows, Service Release 1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT, version 4.0
<LI>The Beta 1 version of Microsoft Internet Explorer, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you install Microsoft Office 97, Service Release 1 (SR-1), on a computer
running Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0, and you restart the computer, you
may receive an error message similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft (R) Windows NT (TM) Version 4.0 (Build 1381: Service Pack 3).
   1 System Processor [32 MB Memory]
   ...
   STOP: c0000221 {Bad Image Checksum}
   The image HLINK.DLL is possibly corrupt. The header checksum does not
   match the computed checksum.

   Restart and set the recovery options in the system control panel or the
   /CRASHDEBUG system start option. If this message reappears, contact
   your system administrator or technical support group.

</PRE>After you receive this error message, you cannot restart Windows NT and
use your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 with either Service Pack 2
   (SP2) or Service Pack 3 (SP3).
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The Beta 1 version of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 is installed on
   your computer.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: This problem does NOT occur if either Beta 2 or the final released
version of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 is installed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this behavior, use the following appropriate method.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Windows NT 4.0 Is Installed on a FAT Partition</h3>
 
<P>
You may be able to correct this problem copying a new version of the
Hlink.dll file from another computer to your computer. Before you do this,
you must create a boot disk that contains Hlink.dll. To create the boot
disk, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert a blank floppy disk into a computer that is running Microsoft
   Windows 95.

<P><LI>Double-click My Computer. Right-click the icon for the floppy disk
   drive in the My Computer window, and click Format on the shortcut menu.

<P><LI>In the Format dialog box, click Full, and then click to select the
   Copy System Files check box. Then, click Start. After the disk is
   completely formatted, close the dialog box by clicking Close twice.

<P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Find and click Files Or Folders. In the
   Named box, type "Hlink.dll" (without the quotation marks). Click Find
   Now.

<P><LI>Right-click the Hlink.dll file that is found. On the shortcut menu,
   click Copy.

<P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open box, type "A:" (without
   the quotation marks). Click OK.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Paste.
<P>
</OL>The Hlink.dll file is copied from the Windows\System folder to the
floppy disk. After the file is copied, remove the floppy disk from the
computer.
<P>
To replace the corrupted Hlink.dll file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the floppy disk into the computer on which the problem is
   occurring.

<P><LI>Restart the computer.
<P>
   After the computer is restarted, you see the command prompt.

<P><LI>Type the following command
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\hlink.dll c:\winnt\system32\hlink.dll
</PRE><P>
   and press ENTER. If you are prompted to overwrite the existing file, do
   so. If the path to your System32 folder is different, use the
   appropriate path in the command line.

<P><LI>After the file is copied, remove the floppy disk from the computer
   and restart the computer.
<P>
</OL>If Microsoft Windows NT is not restarted, it may be necessary to contact
Microsoft Windows NT Technical Support for additional assistance.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Windows NT 4.0 Is Installed on an NTFS Partition</h3>
 
<P>
If your version of Windows NT 4.0 is installed on an NT File System (NTFS)
partition, it is not possible to replace the corrupted Hlink.dll file
because it is not possible to access the contents of the NTFS partition if
you cannot start Windows NT 4.0. In this case, it may be necessary to
reformat your hard disk and reinstall Windows NT 4.0. Restore any data
stored in the inaccessible partition from a backup copy.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because of a conflict between Microsoft Office 97 SR-1
and the Beta 1 version (also known as Build 544) of Microsoft Internet
Explorer 4.0. This conflict occurs when both products are installed on a
computer that is running Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
Note that this problem does NOT occur if the Beta 2 version (also known as
Platform Preview 2 or Build 1008) or the final released version of
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 is installed on your computer. The
problem described in the "Symptoms" section in this article is caused by
the earlier version of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 NOT by Microsoft
Office 97 SR-1.
<P>
NOTE: The Beta 1 version of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 was not fully
tested. It should not be deployed in production environments. Support for
beta products is limited. If you want to install and use Microsoft Office
97 SR-1, you cannot also use the Beta 1 version of Microsoft Internet
Explorer 4.0.
