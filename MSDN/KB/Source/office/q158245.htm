The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.2, 4.3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the setup program for Microsoft Office 97 and you click No to
the prompt asking whether to remove your earlier version of Microsoft
Office, shared applications from your earlier version of Microsoft Office
4.x are removed anyway.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the Microsoft Office 97 setup program removes some of the shared
applications from an earlier version of Microsoft Office, you do not have
to reinstall the files from the earlier version of Microsoft Office. The
Microsoft Office 97 setup program is designed to remove any earlier
versions of the shared applications if it is going to install a newer
version. This way, the registry remains up-to-date and there is no
conflicting information.
<P>
NOTE: If you are using a program from your earlier version of Microsoft
Office, Microsoft Word version 6.0 for example, and you want to use a
shared application, such as Equation Editor, the 32-bit version of Equation
Editor that is installed with Microsoft Office 97 is used, despite the fact
Microsoft Word 6.0 is a 16-bit program.
<P>
Do NOT reinstall the shared applications from your earlier version of
Microsoft Office. This resets the Windows registry to these versions and
they cannot be used by Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design of the Microsoft Office 97 setup program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The shared applications in Microsoft Office version 4.x are installed, by
default, in the \Windows\Msapps folder. If you perform a complete
installation of this earlier version of Microsoft Office, you have the
following shared application folders (and the necessary files and programs
to run the shared applications) installed in the \Windows\Msapps folder:
<P>
<PRE>   Artgalry
   Equation
   Grphflt
   Msgraph5
   Msinfo
   Msquery
   Orgchart
   Proof
   Sheetcnv
   Textconv
   Wordart

</PRE>After you install Microsoft Office 97 and choose not to remove your earlier
version of Microsoft Office, the \Windows\Msapps folder contains only the
following shared application folders:
<P>
<PRE>   Grphflt
   Proof
   Sheetcnv
   Textconv
   Wordart

</PRE>By default, the shared applications in Microsoft Office 97 are installed to
the \Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared folder. Even though this
is a completely different folder than Microsoft Office 4.x uses, the
Microsoft Office 97 setup program may remove some of your earlier version
files.
