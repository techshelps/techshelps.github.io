The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office Assistant for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Office Assistant, when you click one of the file
names in the Help topic window, one of the following may occur:

<UL><LI>The file does not open
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The Locate File 'FILENAME.EXT' dialog box appears (where FILENAME.EXT is
   either the name of the file that you clicked, WINWORD.EXE or EXCEL.EXE).
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This first problem occurs if the HELPPLUS.DLL file has become damaged.
<P>
The second problem occurs if the HELPPLUS.INI file has been deleted or has
become damaged, and the Microsoft Office Assistant cannot locate the file
you clicked in the Help topic window.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround 1</h3>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Decompress the HELPPLUS.DL_ file from the Microsoft Office Assistant
   Disk 3 (3.5-Inch) or Disk 4 (5.25-Inch) into your Windows directory.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Run the Microsoft Office Assistant Setup program, and completely remove
   and then install the Microsoft Office Assistant again.
<P>
</UL><h3>Workaround 2</h3>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, select the file from the File Name list in
the Locate File dialog box and choose OK. The file opens and the
location information for this file type and the application in which
the file opens is correctly written to the HELPPLUS.INI file.
<P>
Note that this workaround only corrects the information for the file
type of the file that you located and opened. This procedure must be
repeated for each individual file type that is missing from the
HELPPLUS.INI file.
<P>
To restore the entire HELPPLUS.INI file, run the Microsoft Office
Assistant Setup program and remove all of the files. Then run the
Setup program again and install the program.
<P>
To find the location of a file that appears in the Locate File dialog
box, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In the Locate File dialog box, choose Cancel.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Office Assistant, choose the Search button.

<P><LI>In the Search dialog box, type one of the following, according to the
   type of file you want to locate:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Access database, about
      compound documents, about
      Excel templates, default directories for
      PowerPoint templates
      Word templates, about
</PRE>
<P><LI>Choose Go To.
<P></OL>
