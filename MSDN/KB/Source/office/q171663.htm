<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to save a Binder in Microsoft Office 97, you may receive
one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Office Binder cannot save the binder. Close other programs, check
   for disk space on the drive you are saving to and on the drive
   containing your Temp folder, and then save again.
   The file operation cannot be completed because the disk is full.

   -or-

   Disk Full.

</PRE>When you click OK, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Document not saved. Any previously saved copy may have been deleted.

</PRE>When you attempt to insert a section into a Binder file, you may receive
the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   An error occurred while creating the temporary file. Make sure there is
   enough disk space available on the drive that contains your Tmp or
   Temp folder.

   Office Binder cannot add the section to the binder. This type of file
   may not be supported by Office Binder.
   An unexpected error has occurred.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur if there is not enough free hard disk space on
your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Before you save a Binder file or insert sections into an existing Binder,
verify that there is adequate free disk space on the hard disk you are
using.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you receive the error messages described in the "Symptoms" section in
this article, a file with the name you selected is saved to the hard disk.
However, this file is not a valid Binder file and cannot be opened. When
you try to open this file, and there is not enough hard disk space, you may
receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   There is not enough memory available to complete this action. Close any
   other programs and try this again.

</PRE>When you click OK, the same error may appear again.
<P>
When you click OK a second time, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Office Binder cannot open or create the binder. Close other programs
   and check for disk space on the drive that contains your temp folder.
   There is not enough memory to perform the operation.

   -or-

   There is not enough memory to start MSO97.dll. Quit some programs and
   try again.

</PRE>After you make enough hard disk space available, you may receive the
following error message when you attempt to open the file:
<P>
<PRE>   Binder caused an invalid page fault in module MSO97.dll at 0137:306c25c8
