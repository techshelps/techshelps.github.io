The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) as the shell in Microsoft
Windows, the files that are listed in the load= or run= settings in
the [windows] section of the WIN.INI file are not loaded when you
start Microsoft Windows. Additionally, the applications that are
located in the StartUp group in Program Manager do not run when
you start Microsoft Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you use MOM version 4.0 as the shell in Microsoft
Windows by adding MSOFFICE.EXE to the shell= setting in the SYSTEM.INI
file. Using MOM as the shell prevents any files that you have listed in the
load= or run= setting in the WIN.INI file from being loaded, and also
prevents any programs that are located in the StartUp group in Program
Manager from running when you start Microsoft Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To make sure that the files that are listed in the load= or run= setting in
the WIN.INI file are loaded, and programs that are located in the StartUp
group run when you start Windows, do not use the MSOFFICE.EXE file (MOM) as
the shell in Microsoft Windows. You can load MOM when you start Microsoft
Windows using either of the following methods:
<P>
Method 1
 

<OL><P><LI>Add MSOFFICE.EXE to the load= or run= setting in the [windows]
   section of the WIN.INI file.

<P><LI>Add the Microsoft Office icon to the StartUp group in Program
   Manager.
<P>
</OL>-or-
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
To make sure that the files that are listed in the load= or run=
setting in the WIN.INI file are loaded when you start Windows,
upgrade to Microsoft Office version 4.2. MOM version 4.2 ships with
this version of Microsoft Office and corrects this problem.
<P>
Note that MOM version 4.2 does NOT correct the problem of preventing
the programs in the StartUp group from running, when you use MOM as
the shell in Microsoft Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft
products listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has
been corrected in Microsoft Office Manager version 4.2.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about using a shell in Microsoft Windows other than
PROGMAN.EXE causing the load=, run= and StartUp groups to be ignored,
query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
