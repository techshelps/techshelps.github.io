<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Office Binder, when you add a Text file (.txt) to a Binder,
you receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   The document &lt;filename&gt; cannot be added to the binder because the
   document type is not compatible with Office Binders. Would you like
   to continue?

</PRE>where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file that you selected to add to the
Binder.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because .txt files are not recognized by Microsoft
Binder, even though these files are commonly used in Microsoft Word.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem in Binder, you can add a section from a
Microsoft Word file, and then insert the .txt file into the section in
Binder by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>Insert a section in your Binder from a Microsoft Word document.
   (Note that the document does not have to contain any text).

<P><LI>Click the section that you just added in the section pane. On the
   Section menu, click View Outside.
<P>
   The file "Document In Binder1" is opened in Microsoft Word.

<P><LI>Click the insertion point in the location where you want to add the
   .txt file.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click File. From the Files Of Type list, select
   Text Files (*.txt). In the list of files, click the file that you
   want to insert, and click OK.
<P>
   The file is inserted in the Word document at the location of the
   insertion point.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Close And Return To Binder1.
<P>
</OL>Note that this method works best if you have plenty of memory available on
your computer and if the file that you are inserting does not take up a
very large amount of disk space.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
