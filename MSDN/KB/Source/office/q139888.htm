<LI>Microsoft Office Resource Kit for Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Unbind utility that ships with the Microsoft Office Resource Kit (ORK)
allows you to separate a Microsoft Office Binder document into its
component files. You do not need to have Microsoft Office version 7.0
installed on your computer to use this utility. In addition, you can use
this Utility on a Macintosh computer.
<P>
Note, however, that in order to open and work with the component files, you
must have either Microsoft Office for the Macintosh version 4.2 or later or
standalone versions of the Microsoft Office programs installed on your
Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>To install the Unbind Utility on a Macintosh Computer</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Copy the Unbind.hqx file from the ORK CD-ROM to a disc.
<P>
   Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit:
   Unbind.hqx is located in the Tools\Unbind\Mac folder on the
   ORK CD-ROM.
<P>
   Microsoft Office Resource Kit for Windows 95:
   Unbind.hqx is located in the Coexist\Macintosh\Unbind folder on the
   ORK CD-ROM.

<P><LI>Insert the floppy disk in your Macintosh floppy disk drive.
<P>
   NOTE: You must have PC Exchange or a similar product installed on your
   Macintosh so that your Macintosh can read an MS-DOS formatted
   disk. (PC Exchange is included with System 7.5).

<P><LI>On your Macintosh, start BinHex version 4.0 or 5.0.

<P><LI>When BinHex is started, click once on the introduction screen to go to
   the next step.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Upload, and then click Application (if you are
   using BinHex 4.0), or click Download, and then click Application (if you
   are using BinHex 5.0).

<P><LI>In the dialog box that appears, select the Unbind.hqx file located on
   the floppy disk, and then click Open.

<P><LI>In the next dialog box, the default "Save document as" name is
   Unbind.exe. Leave it this way and click the Desktop button to save this
   new file to the desktop. Note that if you don't switch to the desktop,
   BinHex tries to save the file to the floppy disk.

<P><LI>Click the Save button.
<P>
</OL>This file conversion process can take several minutes. Once the file is
converted, you should end up with a file called Unbind.exe on your desktop.
<P>
Once this file is created on your Macintosh, you can separate component
files from binders created in Microsoft Office version 7.0.
<P>
<P><h3>To Unbind a File</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert the floppy disk with the binder file in your Macintosh floppy
   disk drive.

<P><LI>Copy the binder file to the Macintosh desktop or hard disk.

<P><LI>Double-click the Unbind.exe icon.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open binder.

<P><LI>In the dialog box, select your binder file and click Open.
<P>
</OL>Repeat steps 4-5 for each binder file you want unbound, and then click Quit
on the File menu when you are finished.
<P>
The components of the binder file will be unbound: you should have a file
on your desktop, assuming your binder file was on the desktop, for each of
the binder component files. You now can open each component file from
within its respective Microsoft Office program. Each of the binder
component files, when unbound from your binder file, will be placed in the
same location as the binder file.
