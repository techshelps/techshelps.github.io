<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The first time you run Help in one of the Microsoft Office programs listed
at the beginning of this article, it may take a long time before you can
use the Help program to look up information.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because the first time you run the .Hlp file for an
program, the Setting Up Help dialog box appears (with the animated book and
pen) while the Help file is being set up. Additionally, the first time you
click the Find tab in Help, an additional amount of time is required to
load the word list. This behavior is by design of Microsoft Help, and this
time for setting up the file is only required the first time you run Help
or click the Find button in Help.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, note that in Microsoft Windows 95 you can
switch from the Setting Up Help dialog box to another program and work in
that program while Help is being set up. When Help is finished being set
up, the Help program becomes the active program to let you know that it is
finished.
<P>
To avoid additional time in setting up the Find feature, you can use the
Index tab to locate information instead of the Find tab. The Index tab in a
Windows 95 help file behaves the same as the Search button in a Windows 3.x
help file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Help file in Microsoft Windows 95, there may be up to four
different tabs available in the Help dialog box: Contents, Index, Find, and
Answer Wizard.
<P>
The Contents tab contains a list of help topics. The Index tab contains a
box in which you can enter the first few letters of the word you're looking
for, and then a list of corresponding index entries for that word that you
can choose to display information for. Find enables you to search for
specific words and phrases in help topics, instead of searching for
information by category.
<P>
The first time you click the Find tab, a Loading Word List dialog box
appears, followed by a Find Setup Wizard dialog box. Before you can use
Find, Windows must first create a list (or database), that contains every
word from your help file(s). You have the following options for creating
this list:
<P>
<PRE>   Minimize database size (recommended)
   Maximize search capabilities
   Customize search capabilities
