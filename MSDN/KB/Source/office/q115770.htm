<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Office, when you select the Typical, Complete/Custom, or
Laptop (Minimum) setup option, you may receive one of the following error
messages:

<OL><P><LI>Setup Message
   Please Report File='.\list.c',Line='1001' to Microsoft
   Product Support Services.
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>Setup Message
   Please Report File='.\copyfile.c',Line='72' to Microsoft
   Product Support Services.
<P>
   Note: You may also receive this message with Line='78'
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>Setup was not completed successfully
   Error "inicm.c line 134"
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>Setup Message
   Please Report File='.\list.c',Line='1032' to Microsoft
   Product Support Services
<P>
   NOTE: This usually happens when you are selecting components in the
   Complete/Custom option of Setup. This may also occur when you are not
   making custom selections. To work around this problem, do a clean boot
   (but load SHARE.EXE). Start Windows in Standard Mode, then run Setup
   again, try selecting the Typical or Laptop option. You can add or
   remove items in Setup maintenance mode.
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>Setup Message
   Please Report File='.restart.c', line='59'
<P>
</OL>After you choose the OK button, a new dialog box is displayed with the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Office Setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE></OL>When you choose the OK button again, the Setup program ends, and you are
returned to Program Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because Microsoft Office expects a disk drive letter
for the location of the Windows directory in the PATH statement of your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If the AUTOEXEC.BAT file shows the path to the windows
directory without a disk drive letter, as in the following example
<P>
<PRE>   PATH=\WINDOWS

</PRE>you will receive the error message. The error also occurs if you include
the drive letter, but exclude the equal sign, as in the example below:
<P>
<PRE>   PATH C:\WINDOWS

</PRE>The error message may also be caused if you have \DOS in the path.
<P>
Even if windows is explicitly stated in the path with the drive letter, it
may not be read if there are invalid directories listed before it in the
path. This might occur if you have deleted directories from your hard
drive, but have not updated the path statement.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, change the PATH statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
to include the drive letter for the Windows directory and ensure that all
the directories are valid. For example, change the statement to:
<P>
<PRE>   PATH=C:\WINDOWS
