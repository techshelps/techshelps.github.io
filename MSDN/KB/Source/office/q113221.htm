The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
<P>
If Microsoft Word 6.0 is not already installed on your computer when you
attempt to install Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) from the Microsoft Office
4.0 Upgrade package, you will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup could not find Microsoft Word 6.0 installed on your system. Please
   install Microsoft Word 6.0 before installing this application.

</PRE>NOTE: MOM is not a stand-alone application; it is only available to
licensed Microsoft Office owners.
<P>
This problem occurs only with Microsoft Office version 4.0 when you are
installing from the 1 Microsoft Office Disk and the 9 Microsoft Word disks.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) is designed to be installed on a computer on
which Microsoft Word 6.0 is already installed. This setup order is enforced
to ensure that the clip art index and thumbnail files are installed
properly for Microsoft Word's clip art to work with the Microsoft Office
ClipArt Gallery.
<P>
The above error message may appear if you are using a word processor other
than Microsoft Word 6.0.
<P>
NOTE: If Microsoft Word 6.0 is not on your system, MOM will not install the
ClipArt Gallery. Re-installing MOM after you install word will install the
ClipArt Gallery successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow the appropriate procedure below.
<P>
<P><h3>If you plan to use Word 6.0</h3>
 
<P>
To correct the setup issue with MOM, install Word 6.0 before you attempt to
install MOM.
<P>
If you are using a word processor other than Word 6.0,
and you do not want Word installed on your computer
 
<P>
To use MOM when you are using a word processor other than Word 6.0 (such as
WordPerfect), do the following to add a "dummy" WINWORD6.INI file to your
Windows system directory:

<OL><P><LI>In a text editor, such as Windows Notepad, type the following
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Microsoft Word]
      Picture-Path=&lt;drive&gt;:&lt;path&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; and &lt;path&gt; refer to the drive and directory where clip art
   has been installed (this path will most likely be your Windows
   directory). For example, if your Windows directory is called windows and
   is on your C drive, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      PICTURE-PATH=C:\WINDOWS
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save this file in your Windows directory and name it "WINWORD6.INI"
   (without the quotation marks).
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you use this workaround and then later you decide to install Word
6.0, you will need to re-install MOM after you install Word 6.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MOM specifically looks for GOLF.WMF to determine whether the clip art has
been installed correctly. If the GOLF.WMF file is not in the directory
specified in the Picture-Path statement in your WINWORD6.INI file, the
ClipArt Gallery will not be installed and you will receive the error
message stating that you need to install Word 6.0.
