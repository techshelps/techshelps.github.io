The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you copy an AutoShape from any of the programs listed at the beginning
of this article, and then paste the AutoShape into a program that is not
included in Microsoft Office 97, you may notice one or more of the
following problems:

<UL><LI>One or more of the edges of the pasted AutoShape may be missing. For
   example, one edge of a star may be missing.

<LI>If the copied AutoShape contains a patterned fill, the pasted AutoShape
   may contain a solid color fill.

<LI>If the copied AutoShape contains a textured fill, the textured fill may
   "leak" out of the pasted AutoShape and fill a rectangular area centered
   around the AutoShape.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur when you copy an AutoShape, and then paste it into
either of the following programs:

<UL><LI>Corel Draw 6.x
<LI>Quarterdeck HiJaak PRO for Windows 95
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to work around these problems by first pasting the
AutoShape into another program, such as Microsoft Paint. If you then copy
the AutoShape from Microsoft Paint and paste it into another program, the
problems described in the "Symptoms" section in this article may not occur.
<P>
Note that using this method converts the AutoShape from an enhanced
metafile (EMF) into a bitmap (BMP). After this conversion occurs, it may
not be possible to perform certain functions with the converted AutoShape.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you use Microsoft Office 97 and Corel Draw 6.x or
HiJaak PRO for Windows 95. This is a known problem that occurs when you
paste enhanced metafiles, such as AutoShapes, into certain programs. Note
that the problem does not occur when you paste an AutoShape into any of the
programs included in Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the programs included in Microsoft Office 97, an AutoShape is stored as
an enhanced metafile (EMF). If you copy an AutoShape and paste it into
another program, the other program may incorrectly handle the copied EMF.
As a result, the pasted AutoShape may appear differently than the original
AutoShape. These problems may also occur if you use the Paste Special
command (if available) to paste the copied AutoShape into another program.
