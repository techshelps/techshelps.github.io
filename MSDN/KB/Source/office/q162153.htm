</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur if all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You have installed Microsoft Office 97 on a computer that supports
   Advanced Power Management and the Suspend feature.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You have installed Microsoft Office 97 from an administrative
   installation stored on a network server. When you are prompted by the
   Setup program, you chose to perform a Run From Server installation of
   Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You click Suspend on the Start menu, or allow the computer to suspend
   itself automatically after a specified amount of idle time.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You cancel the suspended state on the computer by moving the mouse,
   by pressing a key, or by pressing the computer's power switch.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Do not use the Suspend feature when Microsoft Office 97 has been
   installed from a network server using the Run From Server option.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Make sure you close all Microsoft Office 97 programs before you
   activate the Suspend feature.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: This problem should not occur if you perform a Typical or Custom
installation of Microsoft Office 97. Only Run From Server installations
are affected.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If your computer supports it, you can use the APM (Advanced Power
Management) feature in Microsoft Windows 95 to control how your computer
uses and conserves power. One of the features included with APM is the
Suspend feature; on the Start menu, when you click Suspend, the contents of
your computer's memory are written to your hard disk, and the computer is
essentially shut down. When you return your computer to its original
running state, the programs that you were running when you activated the
Suspend feature are still available.
<P>
When you use the Suspend feature, all network connections between your
computer and other computers are shut down. When you return your computer
to its original running, some of the network connections may not be
properly re-established by Windows 95. Therefore, any Microsoft Office 97
program you run from a network connection generates one or more of the
error messages listed when you cancel the suspended state on the computer.
The programs are loaded into memory correctly, but the network connection
may be broken.
