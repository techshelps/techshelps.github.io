The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, versions 7.0,
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.2, 4.2-CD, 4.2c, 4.3, 4.3-CD
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a list of the supported methods for installing Microsoft
Office on a workstation:

<UL><LI>Run Setup from a Microsoft Office CD.

<LI>Run Setup from a set of Microsoft Office disks.

<LI>Run Setup from a server on which an administrative installation of
   Microsoft Office was performed.
<P>
   This includes tools that large organizations may use to run the
   Microsoft Office Setup program, for example, Microsoft Systems
   Management Server (SMS).

<LI>Perform an image installation by using the System Difference Tool
   (SysDiff) that is included in Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0.

<LI>Perform an image installation using SMS Installer.
<P>
</UL>If you cannot reproduce an issue on a computer on which you ran Setup,
Microsoft Technical Support requires that you run Setup on the problem
computer in order to continue troubleshooting the issue.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An image installation involves installing Office on a workstation and
making an image (a copy) of the workstation to install Office on other
workstations. Note that you must be logged on to the workstation as a user
(not as the administrator) when you perform this installation.
<P>
Microsoft is unable to support image installations that are created by
using a third-party utility for the following reasons:

<UL><LI>Microsoft cannot guarantee the accuracy of a third-party product to
   successfully install Microsoft Office by installing all necessary
   files to the correct locations and by creating all required registry
   entries.

<LI>There is no method to uninstall or reinstall Microsoft Office if it
   is not installed by using one of the methods listed in the "Summary"
   section of this article.
<P>
</UL><h3>General Guidelines for Troubleshooting Installation of Office</h3>
 
<P>
If you are having problems running the Microsoft Office Setup program,
contact Microsoft Technical Support. If you are having problems installing
Microsoft Office by using a Microsoft utility other than the Setup program,
call the correct Microsoft product support group. If you are using a third-
party utility, call the manufacturer of that product.
<P>
Use the following steps to troubleshoot problems that you are having when
you install Office:

<UL><LI>Determine whether the problem occurs only on one machine.
<P>
   To do this, reinstall Microsoft Office on the problem computer by using
   the method used to install the current installation of Microsoft Office.
   If the problem is not corrected, run Setup.

<LI>Determine whether the problem occurs on multiple machines or for
   multiple users.
<P>
   To do this, run Setup on another computer, or log on to the computer as
   a user and run Setup. If the problem is corrected, the previous method
   of installing Microsoft Office was not successful. If you used a third-
   party utility, contact the manufacturer of the utility that was used. If
   running Setup does not correct the problem, contact Microsoft Technical
   Support.
<P>
</UL>For additional information about supported methods of installing Office,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
