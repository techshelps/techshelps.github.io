<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was published as part one of a five-part
series in the 12.12.94 issue of MacWeek.
<P>
<P><h2>TIPS AND TRICKS FOR MICROSOFT OFFICE VERSION 4.2</h2>
 
<P>
Dear Mac User:
<P>
Microsoft is beginning a five-part series of tips and tricks about
Microsoft Office Standard version 4.2, which includes Microsoft Excel
5.0, Word 6.0, PowerPoint 4.0, and a Microsoft Mail 3.1 workstation
license. The first part of this series is on installation sizes. We
hope you will find this information useful as you upgrade your
organization to Office Standard version 4.2.
<P>
<PRE>                                                   - The Microsoft Mac Team

</PRE><h2>PART 1: INSTALLATION SIZES AND WHAT THEY MEAN</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Install no more than what you need!</h3>
 
<P>
The new versions of the Office programs are loaded with new features
and functionality. We leave it up to you as to which features and
functionality you want to load given your hardware and how you use
the programs. In Office, we offer four installation options: Minimum,
Typical, Complete, and Custom.
<P>
NOTE: For more information about the four installation options, see
the Installation Options section below.
<P>
Most users should choose the typical installation. The chart below
shows the amount of hard-disk space (in megabytes) necessary for each
of the installation options:
<P>

   -------------------------------------------------------------------

</PRE>* For PowerMac Office, the figures shown are final installation sizes.
<PRE>  Setup will need up to 20 megabytes of additional space on the hard disk
  in order to install properly. This space is used only during
  installation, and becomes available again once installation is complete.

</PRE><h3>Installation Options</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Minimum install is recommended for PowerBooks or disk-constrained
   Macintosh computers. It installs only the necessary program files. All
   capabilities of the main program files are available.

<LI>Typical install is most common among our users, and is the default
   choice. This provides you with all of most popular features and
   functionality. It excludes such items as Remote Data Access in Microsoft
   Excel, Converters and Equation Editor in Word, and Clip Art in
   PowerPoint and Word. Of course, should you need these features, it is
   quite simple to reinstall them.

<LI>Complete install is recommended for power users, company support desks,
   and network server installations. It includes a wide range of converters
   and advanced programmability tools.  Notice that in a Complete Install,
   the size of Office is less than the sum of the individual programs
   thanks to shared components such as spell checking, Microsoft Graph, and
   Word Art.

<LI>Custom install allows the user maximum flexibility to install only the
   features and components that he or she chooses. You can use the same
   process to uninstall previously loaded components to save disk space.
<P>
</UL>On a typical install, Office 4.2 actually takes up less space (as a %
of hard drive) than Office 3.0.
<P>
<PRE>                              1992 - Mac IIci   1994 - Power Macintosh 6100

   Hard -disk size**          80                170
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Size of Office             28 (version 3.0)  37 (version 4.2)

   % of Office to hard disk   35%               23%
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

</PRE>** Typical business Macintosh configuration.
<P>
We ship separate program files for 68K Mac installation and Power
Macintosh installation in the box without any added cost to you.
However, to save on disk space, we recommend that you install one or
the other, not both. Most people do not have to install both files
(i.e. "fat binary") on their desktop, although this is appropriate
for network server installations.
<P>
<P><h3>Network Installations</h3>
 
<P>
For our networked customers, we provide two options:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Disk images on  a network server location from which you can run a
      local installation.

   2. Uncompressed images that you can run shared from the network.

</PRE><h3>Feature Tip: Have you met MOM?</h3>
 
<P>
Included in Office is Microsoft Office Manager (MOM). This utility
allows you to work faster and easier within Office. From the MOM
menu, you can launch or switch to any other program in Office by
simply clicking an icon. This menu is fully customizable, so you can
have additional programs at your fingertips.
<P>
Look out for Part 2 coming in the next issue! The topic will be RAM
issues on 68K Mac and Power Mac.
<P>
<P><h3>Need More Information?</h3>
 

<UL><LI>By Phone: Please call the Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800)
   426-9400, and request the Mac Office Installation fact sheet. Ask for
   part number 098-58026. This will provide more details, including a
   specific list of the components included in each installation option.

<LI>By Fax: You can call Microsoft Sales Fax Services at (800) 727-3351 and
   request data sheets for any of the applications in Microsoft Office.

<LI>Online:  See our AppleLink forum. Third Parties (H-O): Microsoft:
   Office: Tips&amp;Tricks, Installation - for the Installation fact sheet.
<P>
</UL>·- On Product Disk:  Check the "Readme Before Installation" or the "Office
<PRE>   Readme - Network" files on Disk 1 of the application install disks.

</PRE>A license to run one Microsoft Mail workstation is included in
Microsoft Office Standard. The workstation license does not include
Microsoft Mail software and requires Microsoft Mail Server (acquired
separately) which contains all Mail software.
