The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you double-click the Value Pack Installer, which is located in the
Value Pack folder that is included in Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh
Edition, you may receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   The default location required for this install could not be found.
   This install will be cancelled.

</PRE>and no Value Pack components are installed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if any of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are running the Office 98 programs directly from a location on a
   network server.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You performed a Run From CD installation of Office 98 and you are
   running Office from the compact disc (CD).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You have removed Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition from your
   computer.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the first two problems, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Office 98 Is Running from a Network Server</h3>
 
<P>
To install components from the Value Pack, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Drag the Microsoft Office 98 folder from the network server to the
   hard disk on your computer.

<P><LI>Double-click the Value Pack Installer in the Value Pack folder on your
   Office CD.

<P><LI>After you have installed the Value Pack components, drag the Microsoft
   Office 98 folder from hard disk on your computer back to the network
   server that contains the network installation of Microsoft Office 98
   Macintosh Edition.
<P>
   NOTE: When you perform this step, you must have full access to the
   Microsoft Office 98 folder on the network server. If you do not, you
   may receive an error message that is similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      You cannot copy "Microsoft Office 98" onto the folder "&lt;Folder&gt;",
      because you do not have the privilege to make changes.
</PRE><P>
</OL>After the files in the local Microsoft Office 98 folder are copied to the
Microsoft Office 98 folder on the network server, you can use the installed
Value Pack components on your computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Office 98 Is Running from the CD</h3>
 
<P>
If you have performed a Run From CD installation of Office 98, you cannot
install most of the components included in the Value Pack. This is true
because most of the components are installed in the Microsoft Office 98
folder; because the folder is located on the Office 98 CD, the files cannot
be installed.
<P>
However, it is still possible to install the fonts and Microsoft Office
Manager (MOM), which is included in the Value Pack. To do this, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the Value Pack folder on the Office 98 CD, open the folder that
   contains the component you want to install.

<P><LI>Drag the files from the folder into the System Folder on the hard
   disk on the computer.
<P>
   The System software automatically moves the files to the correct
   subfolder in the System Folder.

<P><LI>Restart the computer.
<P>
   The fonts or Microsoft Office Manager are available after the computer
   is restarted.
<P>
</OL>To work around the third problem, use the following method:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3: Office 98 Has Been Removed from Your Computer</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the Finder, create a folder named "Microsoft Office 98" in the root
   folder of your hard drive.

<P><LI>Then, create a folder named "Office" in the Microsoft Office 98 folder.

<P><LI>Copy any file into the Microsoft Office 98:Office folder. Then, rename
   the file to "Microsoft Office 98", without quotation marks.
<P>
</OL>When you run the Value Pack Installer, you should not receive the error 
message. You can then use the Installer to remove Value Pack components 
from your computer. When you are done removing components, you should 
delete the Microsoft Office 98 folder.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
