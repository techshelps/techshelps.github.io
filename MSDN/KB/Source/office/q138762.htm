The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a Microsoft Excel worksheet section of a Microsoft Office Binder, some
of the add-ins may not function properly or may not work at all. Even
though the add-ins appear to be installed, some of their functionality may
be missing while you are in an Office Binder.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If the add-in you are trying to use does not appear to be functioning as it
does outside of Office Binder, view the Binder section outside of the
Binder. In order to view your Binder section outside of the Binder, click
View Outside on the Section menu.
<P>
To return to the Binder, click Close on the File menu.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a list of the add-ins that may not have full functionality
when you try to use them in a Microsoft Excel section of an Office Binder:
<P>
<PRE>   View Manager
   Report Manager
   Analysis ToolPak
   AutoSave

</PRE>The following descriptions assume you are in a Microsoft Excel section of
an Office Binder and that each add-in is already installed.
<P>
<P><h3>View Manager</h3>
 
<P>
If you click View Manager on the View menu, you may receive the error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot create or edit views while workbook is an OLE object in another
   application or in an Office Binder.

</PRE><h3>Report Manager</h3>
 
<P>
If you click Report Manager on the View menu, you may receive the
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot print or edit reports while workbook is an OLE object in another
   application or in an Office Binder.

</PRE><h3>Analysis ToolPak</h3>
 
<P>
Any of the functions that are only available when the Analysis ToolPak is
installed will work properly and will show up in the Function Wizard dialog
box. However, if you click Data Analysis on the Tools menu, the Data
Analysis dialog box that lists all of the analysis tools is not displayed.
<P>
<P><h3>AutoSave</h3>
 
<P>
The AutoSave dialog box will appear when you click AutoSave on the Tools
menu; however, if you have the Prompt Before Saving option selected, the
dialog box that confirms whether or not you want to save your file may not
appear. If the confirmation dialog box does appear, it may show up behind
the Binder and will not be visible until you minimize the Binder.
<P>
