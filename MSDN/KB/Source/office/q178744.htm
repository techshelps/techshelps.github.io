<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you print color graphics or photos from Microsoft Office 97, running
under Windows 95, to a Canon 360PS or Apple 12/660 printer using the Adobe
4.1 or 4.2 PostScript printer driver, the color graphics or photos will be
printed with a blue haze or tint over them.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by a conflict between the Windows 95 printer drivers
and Image Color Management (ICM).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Canon USA Technical Support has confirmed that this problem can be resolved
by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Windows Explorer or My Computer, locate the following folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Windows\System\Color
</PRE>
<P><LI>Right-click CLBP3602.ICC (Canon) and/or APLWCSB1.ICM (Apple) and select
   Uninstall.
<P>
</OL>This will remove the ICC color profile and should allow your color graphics
to be printed correctly.
<P>
Contact Canon and/or Apple for more detailed information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The printer drivers and operating systems listed in this article use a
technology called Image Color Management that ensures that the color you
scan, the color on your screen, and the color that prints are all the same.
Any *.ICC and *.ICM files will try to compensate for the different devices;
unfortunately, they are overcompensating with any of the Microsoft Office
97 applications.
<P>
NOTE: The graphics appear correctly on the screen in all views and print
correctly from the same programs running under Windows NT.
<P>
