</PRE><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 
<P>
Connectix RAM Doubler version 1.0.4, which ships with Microsoft Office 4.2,
cannot be installed on a Power Macintosh.
<P>
The MC1063 disk provided with this Application Note contains the Connectix
RAM Doubler 1.5.1 Updater file, which you can use to install Connectix RAM
Doubler version 1.5.1 on a Power Macintosh. Note that if you can install
Connectix RAM Doubler version 1.0.4 on your Macintosh (that is, if you do
not have a Power Macintosh), you can use this same file to update your
current version of Connectix RAM Doubler to version 1.5.1. Connectix RAM
Doubler version 1.5.1 provides the following enhancements to version 1.0.4:

<UL><LI>Compatibility with the Power Macintosh. Connectix RAM Doubler 1.5.1
   supports Macintosh computers equipped with a PowerPC(TM), 68040, 68030,
   or 68020 (with Paged Memory Management Unit [PMMU]) processor.

<LI>Compatibility with SCSI Manager 4.3.

<LI>Improved functionality with GeoPort on the Power Macintosh.

<LI>Compatibility with CD AllCache.

<LI>Increased reliability with file sharing on the Power Macintosh.

<LI>File mapping for the Power Macintosh. File mapping is a technology
   that allows for a reduction in memory requirements by using the memory
   management unit to manage the loading and unloading of native code
   segments.

<LI>Improved reliability with 4- and 5-megabyte (MB) Macintosh computers
   running in 24-bit addressing mode.

<LI>Better compatibility with Apple(R) System 7.5.
<P>
</UL><h2>UPDATING TO CONNECTIX RAM DOUBLER 1.5.1</h2>
 
<P>
To use the Connectix RAM Doubler 1.5.1 Updater file on the enclosed MC1063
disk, you must have one of the following:

   Doubler Installer.
<P>
