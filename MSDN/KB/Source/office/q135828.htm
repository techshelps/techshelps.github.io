<PRE>1. Q. What are the top features of Microsoft Office Binder?

   A. The top ten features of Office Binder are as follows:

       - A Binder retains the order of your files.

       - The sections in a Binder stay together (for functions such as
         storing, printing, saving, and mailing).

       - A Binder is easy to construct and break apart.

       - Page numbers, headers, footers, and so on apply across the
         sections.

       - A Binder has properties as a whole and as parts.

       - Spelling and other utilities apply across parts of a Binder.

       - Part properties are propagated to Binder (and system) level.

       - You can construct a template for an entire Binder.

       - A Binder can be opened and saved as one file.

       - You can establish a hierarchy within a Binder.

2. Q. What is a Binder?

   A. Think of a Binder as an "online" three-ring notebook. It can be
      a collection of programs rolled up into one "notebook" or
      Binder. For example, instead of opening Word, Microsoft Excel,
      and PowerPoint individually, you can open a Binder and add a
      new Word document or Microsoft Excel worksheet. From there, you
      can save the Binder, encompassing all of the previous
      components for use at a later time.

3. Q. What are the components of the Binder?

   A. There are four major components of the Microsoft Office Binder:

       - The Left Pane displays the icons for the individual
         sections. Click the section that you want to work on here.

       - The Right Pane is the actual section in the Binder (for
         example, a Word document or a Microsoft Excel worksheet)
         with the general functionality of the individual program.

       - The File menu includes the Binder file management commands,
         including New, Open, Save, Save As, Properties, Print, and
         Close.

       - The Section menu includes the individual section management
         commands, including Rename, Print, and Hide.

      Also, note that a button in the upper-left corner of the Binder
      allows you to hide or unhide the Left Pane of the Binder.

4. Q. How will the Binder help me with my daily work?

   A. The Binder provides a common storage place for your daily work.
      It can hold multiple sections, so files that are closely
      related can be saved as a group within the Binder. To access
      all of the related files at once, open the saved Binder.

      Printing is easy. With just a few clicks of the mouse, you can
      print all sections of the Binder together. The Binder file can
      have continuous page numbering: start at the number you want,
      and the numbering will continue throughout the individual
      sections. For example, if there is a five-page Word document
      and a two-page Microsoft Excel worksheet in the Binder, the
      page numbering could start with 1 in the Word document end at 7
      in the Microsoft Excel worksheet. There will be no break in the
      page numbering.

5. Q. Can I use drag-and-drop functionality with Office Binder?

   A. There are many different ways to use drag-and-drop
      functionality with a Binder. For drag-and-drop functionality to
      work, Binder must be aware of the program that you are using.
      For example, Office Binder does not recognize Schedule+ files;
      therefore, drag-and-drop functionality between Binder and
      Schedule+ files is not an option. Binder is aware of scraps on
      the desktop, other Binder files, Microsoft Excel worksheets,
      Word documents, and PowerPoint presentations. You can drag data
      anywhere that Windows 95 allows, including the desktop and
      Windows Explorer.
