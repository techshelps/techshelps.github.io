SUMMARY
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office Professional for Windows 95 with the
Bookshelf Integration component, Bookshelf is conveniently integrated with
Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. The integration of Bookshelf with these
Office programs provides quick access to Bookshelf's "All Books" from
either program. It also allows you to obtain instant definitions for most
words in a Word document or Microsoft Excel worksheet. In addition, you can
copy entire articles or selected text and images from Bookshelf directly
into a new or existing location in either of these Office programs.
<P>
This integration of Microsoft Excel with Bookshelf is provided by three
add-ins that are installed when you choose the Bookshelf integration
component of the Microsoft Office setup. This article gives details about
these three add-ins and their functions as they relate to Bookshelf
integration.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you choose the Bookshelf integration component of the Microsoft Office
Setup, the following Microsoft Excel add-ins should be installed on your
hard disk in the locations noted in the table.
<P>
<PRE>Add-in              Install location        Name in Add-Ins dialog box
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>Bshdef.xla          Msoffice\Books95        Bshdef
Msreftlx.xla        Msoffice\Excel\Library  Msreftlx
Bshxl.xla           Msoffice\Excel\Library  Bshxl

</PRE>Note, because the Bshdef.xla file is not automatically installed to the
Msoffice\Excel\Library folder, you should manually copy it from the
Msoffice\Books95 folder to the Msoffice\Excel\Library folder. Also, when
you click on any of these three add-ins in the Add-Ins dialog box, you will
not see any description about the add-in at the bottom of the dialog box.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : XL7: Define Menu Item Missing with Bookshelf Integration

</PRE>Each of these add-in files, when loaded by Microsoft Excel, provides some
Bookshelf integration functionality. The following sections include
descriptions of this functionality for each add-in.
<P>
<P><h3>Bshdef.xla</h3>
 
<P>
This add-in gives you the ability to use the right mouse button to click a
cell that contains a single word and have the Define command appear on the
shortcut menu. When you click Define on the shortcut menu, Bookshelf looks
up the word in the dictionary and then displays the definitions of the
selected word.
<P>
<P><h3>Msreftlx.xla</h3>
 
<P>
This add-in adds the Look Up Reference menu item to the Tools menu. If you
select a cell and then click Look Up Reference on the Tools menu, the
Lookup Reference Title dialog box appears with Microsoft Bookshelf '95
listed as one of the available reference titles. If you click OK, the All
Books screen of Bookshelf comes up on the Contents tab. At this point you
can enter in any text and then perform a search in any of the Bookshelf
reference titles.
<P>
<P><h3>Bshxl.xla</h3>
 
<P>
Bshxl.xla supports the Copy To Microsoft Excel From Bookshelf and part of
the Lookup Reference functionality.
