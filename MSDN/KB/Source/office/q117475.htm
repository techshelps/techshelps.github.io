<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for one of the Microsoft Office applications
listed above, and you then run the Microsoft Office Setup program, and you
select different options for the application that you previously installed,
the options that are selected when you run the Microsoft Office Setup
program are different than the options that are selected when you run the
Setup program for the individual Microsoft Office application. This
behavior occurs even when you install the application to the same
directory.
<P>
For example, you run the Microsoft Word for Windows Setup program, and
select only the Microsoft Word, and the Wizards, Templates, and Letters
options (that is, you clear the other setup options). You then run the
Microsoft Office Setup program and select only the Microsoft Word options
that you did not select during the Microsoft Word Setup program (Proofing
Tools, Online Help, Examples, and Demos, and the Dialog Editor options).
The result is that you have installed the entire Microsoft Word application
on your computer.
<P>
However, if you run the Microsoft Word Setup program again, the only
selected options are Microsoft Word, and Wizards, Templates, and Letters.
Alternatively, when you run the Microsoft Office Setup program, the only
selected Microsoft Word options are Proofing Tools, Online Help, Examples,
and Demos, and the Dialog Editor. You cannot use one Setup program to
remove an option that was installed by another Setup program.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because each Setup program maintains its own Setup
Table File (STF). This file includes information about which options were
selected during the Setup program. The Microsoft Office Setup program uses
the SETUP.STF file that is installed by the Microsoft Office Setup program,
while the individual Microsoft Office application Setup program uses the
SETUP.STF file that is located in the application's SETUP directory.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>To maintain the installed options for the application, use the same
   Setup program that you used to run a complete installation of the
   application. For example, if you used the Microsoft Excel Setup
   program to run a complete installation of Microsoft Excel, use the
   C:\EXCEL\SETUP\SETUP.EXE file to maintain the setup options for
   Microsoft Excel.
<P>
 -or-

<LI>Use only the Microsoft Office Setup program located in the Microsoft
   Office SETUP directory (for example C:\MSOFFICE\SETUP\SETUP.EXE) to
   maintain all of the installation options for the Microsoft Office
   programs. To use this method, you must select all of the desired
   installation options for the application in the Microsoft Office
   Setup program, even if they are already installed on your computer.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
