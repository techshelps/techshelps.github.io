The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2
<LI>Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for Microsoft Office for the Macintosh
(either to perform the initial installation of Office or to use Setup in
maintenance mode), you may receive the following warning message:
<P>
<PRE>   There is not enough space on the following destination volume(s)
   to install all of the options you have selected.

</PRE>When you receive this warning message, you are also advised as to how much
space is required to complete the installation.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the above error message if you do not have enough free
space on the hard disk drive that contains your System Folder. You may also
receive this error message if you have more than one drive or have a
partition and are installing to a non-boot drive with minimal space (even
if the destination partition or drive for the Microsoft Office folder has
adequate free space for the installation).
<P>
The Setup program installs files in the following folders: Preferences,
Extensions, Fonts, and Control Panels. All of these folders are located in
the System Folder. Depending on the type of installation you are
performing, the number of files that the Setup program will install in
these folders will vary.
<P>
The following is an approximate breakdown in the space, on the drive that
contains your System Folder, required for the three basic types of
installations:
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>     Complete/Custom     9575K (if all options are selected)

     Typical             5036K

     Minimum             4731K

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>     Complete/Custom     9489K

     Typical             5324K

     Minimum             4868K

</PRE>NOTE: The values shown above may be different on your computer depending on
the Setup options and the type of Office applications (68k or Power
Macintosh) that you install.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.
<P>
<PRE>Method 1:   Free up enough disk space on the partition or drive that
            contains the System Folder.

Method 2:   Change the type of installation you are performing. For
            example, in a Complete/Custom installation, do not install all
            applications or do not install all the features of the
            applications.

Method 3:   Change your installation destination folder for Microsoft
            Office so that it is on the same drive or partition as your
            System Folder, and ensure that this drive or partition has
            adequate free space.
