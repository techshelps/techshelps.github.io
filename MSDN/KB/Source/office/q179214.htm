<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Installing Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition is as easy as dragging a
folder to the hard disk on your computer. This article explains how to
perform a drag-and-drop installation of Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh
Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The drag-and-drop installation process for Office consists of two distinct
parts. In part 1, you copy files from the Office compact disc (CD) to the
hard disk. In part 2, shared files are copied to the System Folder and
Office programs are configured.
<P>
To perform a drag-and-drop installation of Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh
Edition, follow these steps.
<P>
<P><h3>Part 1: Copying Files to the Hard Disk</h3>
 
<P>
When you perform a drag-and-drop installation, you can either perform an
Easy Install or a Complete Install. When you perform an Easy Install, the
most commonly used Office components are copied to the hard disk. (In
earlier versions of Office, this is called a Typical installation.) An Easy
Install requires approximately 90 megabytes (MB) of free disk space.
<P>
When you perform a Complete Install, all Office components (excluding the
Value Pack components) are copied to the hard disk. A Complete Install
requires approximately 120 MB of free disk space.
<P>
Performing an Easy Install:
<P>
To perform an Easy Install, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition CD into the CD-ROM
   drive.

<P><LI>Drag the Microsoft Office 98 folder to the hard disk.
<P>
</OL>Performing a Complete Install:
<P>
To perform a Complete Install, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition CD into the CD-ROM
   drive.

<P><LI>Open the Office Custom Install folder on the CD.

<P><LI>Drag the Microsoft Office 98 folder to the hard disk.
<P>
</OL><h3>Part 2: Finishing the Installation</h3>
 
<P>
The first time that you start an Office program, a process called the first
run installation process is started. The first run installation process
prompts you to enter some information, and then copies files that are
required by the Office programs to the System Folder.
<P>
To finish the installation, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Microsoft Office 98 folder that is located on the hard disk,
   and then double-click one of the Office programs.

<P><LI>Enter your name and organization and click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK to confirm your name and organization.

<P><LI>Enter the 10-digit CD key that is listed on the back of the Microsoft
   Office 98 Macintosh Edition CD jewel case.

<P><LI>Click OK in the Product ID dialog box.
<P>
</OL>After you supply your name and CD key, the first run installation process
copies files to the System Folder. After these files are copied to the
System Folder, the program that you double-clicked in step 1 is started.
<P>
As the program starts, you may notice that the message "Configuring Office
Components" appears on the startup screen. During this process, all of the
Office components are registered, and the default Preference files are
created. After this process is finished, the Office programs are fully
configured and ready to use.
