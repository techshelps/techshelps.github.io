The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
The following is a list of the new features, changes in functionality, and
limitations of Microsoft Office Manager 4.2 as compared to Microsoft Office
Manager 4.0.
<P>
<PRE>                           LIST OF NEW FEATURES
                           ====================

</PRE><h2>Functionality Changes</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>MOM Is Hidden During PowerPoint Slide Show</h3>
 
<P>
MOM is no longer visible when you run a PowerPoint 4.0 slide show. (To do
this, PowerPoint sends an API call to hide MOM.)
<P>
<P><h3>Workstation Setup/Uninstall Is Streamlined</h3>
 
<P>
The Setup And Uninstall command on the Office menu is unavailable if there
is no valid MSOfficeSetup key in your REG.DAT file. This functionality is
also better documented so that workstation users and users who did not
install the Setup files will no longer get an error stating that you must
run Setup another way.
<P>
<P><h3>Find File Is Easier to Access</h3>
 
<P>
The Find File command appears on the MOM toolbar and menu by default.
<P>
<P><h3>Under Windows NT, ToolTips Are Only Displayed If MOM Has Focus</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running Microsoft Office under Windows NT, ToolTips are
displayed only if MOM has the focus. (This functionality was changed
because of focus problems under NT--MOM gets the focus if it displays a
ToolTip. And ToolTips no longer appear in strange places and remain when
you move the mouse.)
<P>
The "Registered Location" of the Applications on the
<P><h3>Default List Is Now Shown in the Edit Program Item Dialog Box</h3>
 
<P>
MOM gets this info from the REG.DAT file or, if the application is not
registered there, then it gets it from [Extensions] section of WIN.INI
(check in [Extensions] special-cased only for Mail, Microsoft Access 1.x,
and FoxPro versions earlier than 2.5b).
<P>
<P><h3>New Documentation Command with CD Version</h3>
 
<P>
For Office 4.2 on CD, an item is added to the default application list
and is displayed on the toolbar menu by default. This item, called Online
Documentation, is used to access online help.
<P>
<P><h3>Don't Have to Exit MOM to Update to New Installation</h3>
 
<P>
When you install an application while MOM is running, you no longer have to
exit MOM and restart it to get it to recognize the new installation.
<P>
Earlier, MOM only read the REG.DAT when you started Office; therefore,
changes were not seen by MOM during that session. In the new version, MOM
reads REG.DAT whenever you click a toolbar button or choose a menu item.
<P>
<P><h3>Easier Access to Multiple Instances of a Program</h3>
 
<P>
If multiple instances of an application are running, clicking the toolbar
button or choosing it from the Office menu toggles through the existing
instances.
<P>
<P><h2>Features for Customizing Office</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>MOM Can Use Icon in .EXE for Button Face of Custom Item</h3>
 
<P>
MOM can now use the icon embedded in an .EXE file for the button face of a
custom toolbar item.
<P>
To do this, choose Application Icon from the Button Image box in the Add
Program Item dialog box. If the application added does not have an icon
(for example if it's a .BAT or .PIF file, or if it's an MS-DOS
application), MOM uses a generic icon.
<P>
<P><h3>Ability to Disable Splash Screen</h3>
 
<P>
To disable the splash screen when MOM is started, clear the Show Title
Screen At Startup check box on the View tab of the Customize dialog
box.
<P>
New Items Have Been Added to the List
<P><h3>of Applications in the Customize Dialog Box</h3>
 
<P>
New items added to the list of applications in the Customize dialog are as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   MS Money
   Find File
   Run
   Screen Saver
   Task Manager (not on the list if you are using NT)

</PRE>The Screen Saver button only works with screen savers selected in Control
Panel, Desktop. If none are selected, the Screen Saver button and menu do
not do anything.
<P>
<P><h2>New Features for Developers</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Ability to Add/Hide MOM</h3>
 
<P>
Developers who want to add themselves to MOM or hide MOM for a full-screen
application view can modify the MSOFFICE.INI file directly to add
themselves to the toolbar or menu, then send a Windows API call to MOM to
force it to re-read its .INI file and update its display accordingly. To
hide MOM for a full-screen application view, send API calls to MOM to
override the "always on top" property. These features are documented in
MSOFFICE.HLP in the Advanced Office Help section.
<P>
<P><h3>Can Add Entry for Class Name on 32-Bit Versions</h3>
 
<P>
A new feature has been added for Microsoft Application developers who are
working on 32-bit versions of their applications. You can write to a new
[Alias32] section of MSOFFICE.INI (this section will not exist until added
by a 32- bit application--there are none yet that do this), and add an
entry for a 32-bit application's ClassName to correspond with that
application's menu and toolbar item. This is necessary because MOM has
trouble restoring 32-bit applications without knowing its ClassName.
<P>
For example, when 32-bit Word comes out, Word Setup will need to write
an entry to MSOFFICE.INI so that clicking the Word button under Windows NT
launches/restores Word properly. The syntax of the entry is as follows
<P>
<PRE>   [Alias32]
   MSAppx=ClassName[, ModuleName]

</PRE>where MSAppx (or UserAppx) matches the MSApp# or UserApp# for the
application in the [ToolbarOrder] and [MenuOrder] sections of the
MSOFFICE.INI file(applications now use the same number in both
[ToolbarOrder] and [MenuOrder] sections).
<P>
<PRE>                          NEW LIMITATIONS OF MOM
                          ======================

</PRE><h3>Find File Can Only Preview Microsoft Excel 5.0 and PowerPoint 4.0 Files</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint are the only applications that create the
kind of summary file that is compatible with the Find File preview display
mode. Files created in Microsoft Access 2.0, Microsoft Word, or versions of
Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint earlier than 5.0 and 4.0, respectively, will
cause "No Preview Available" text to be shown where the preview would be.
<P>
