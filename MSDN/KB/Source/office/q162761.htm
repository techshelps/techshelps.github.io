The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a, 7.0b
<LI>Microsoft Project for Windows 95, versions 4.1, 4.1a
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start or restart the computer, the following problems may occur:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95 starts a program that is not in the StartUp
   folder.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The Open With dialog box appears. The file referenced in this dialog
   box may vary, depending on what has been installed on the computer.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if an incorrect shortcut target path to Microsoft Find
Fast is in the StartUp folder. The path in the Microsoft Find Fast shortcut
is no longer valid because the file name in this path has changed and no
longer points to Findfast.exe. Because the invalid shortcut to Findfast.exe
is in the StartUp group, you receive the Open With dialog box when
Microsoft Windows 95 starts.
<P>
If you click a program listed in the Open With dialog box and click OK, the
file listed in the Open With dialog box will be associated with that
program. The result is that a program that is not in the StartUp group
opens when Microsoft Windows 95 starts in normal mode.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The Office 97 Remove All option in Setup changes the shortcut to
Findfast.exe in the StartUp group. If you installed Microsoft Office 7.0 or
Microsoft Project for Windows 95 before installing Microsoft Office 97, you
may have two versions of Findfast.exe on your system. To have the shortcut
refer to the correct Findfast.exe file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>When you start the computer and the Open With dialog box appears,
   click Cancel to close the dialog box.

<P><LI>Using the right mouse button (right-click), click the Start button,
   and click Open.

<P><LI>In the Start Menu dialog box, double-click the Programs icon.

<P><LI>In the Programs dialog box, double-click the StartUp icon.

<P><LI>In the StartUp dialog box, right-click the Microsoft Find Fast shortcut
   icon. On the shortcut menu, click Properties.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Find Fast Properties dialog box, click the Shortcut
   tab.

<P><LI>In the Target box, edit the path to point to the Findfast.exe file, and
   click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you do not know where the Findfast.exe file is located, click the
Start button, point to Find, and click Files Or Folders. In the Named box,
type "Findfast.exe" (without the quotation marks). In the Look In box,
select your hard disk. Click to select the Include Subfolders check box,
and then click Find Now. After you find the location of Findfast.exe, type
that location in the Target box of the Microsoft Find Fast Properties
dialog box, and then click OK.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office 97, a new version of Findfast.exe is
installed. In the StartUp folder, the shortcut target path to the
Findfast.exe file is updated to reflect the new location of the Microsoft
Find Fast file. By default, this location is the C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Office\Office folder. When you select the Remove All option in Microsoft
Office 97 Setup, Findfast.exe is removed but the shortcut in the Startup
folder is not updated.
<P>
A program, such as Microsoft WordPad, may accidentally be associated with
the file in the Open With dialog box. When this occurs, Microsoft WordPad
will start every time Microsoft Windows 95 is started even though it is not
in the StartUp folder. This is because the Find Fast shortcut in the
StartUp folder points to a file that is associated with Microsoft WordPad.
