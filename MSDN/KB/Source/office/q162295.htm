</PRE><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
To prevent the error messages from occurring, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open box, type "regedit"
   (without the quotation marks), and click OK.

<P><LI>In the Registry window, click the plus sign (+) to the left of the
   following keys, in the order listed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
      SOFTWARE
      Microsoft
      Shared Tools
</PRE><P>
   Then, click the yellow folder to the left of "Mso97.dll." The text in
   the status bar should read as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      My Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\
<PRE></PRE>         Mso97.dll

</PRE><P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Delete, and then click Yes to delete the key.

<P><LI>On the Registry menu, click Exit.

<P><LI>Run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program.
<P>
</OL>If the error occurs again, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use Windows Explorer to manually create the following folders on
   your hard disk drive (usually drive C):
<P>
<P><PRE>      Program Files\Microsoft Office
      Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office
</PRE><P>
   If you are installing to a different location, create the Office folder
   there instead.
<P>
   NOTE: The Program Files folder should already exist on your hard disk.
   If it does not, create it before you create the above folders.

<P><LI>Copy the following files from the Office folder on your Microsoft Office
   97 compact disc:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Mso97.dll
      Mso7enu.dll
      Mso97fx.dll
      Msoc.dll
      Bdrintl.dll
</PRE><P>
   Paste the files in the Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder on
   your hard disk. If you are installing to a different location, paste
   the files into the Office folder in that location instead.

<P><LI>Search your hard drive for the Mso97.dll and rename or delete it.
   If the Mso97.dll file is allowed to remain in the
   Windows\System folder, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Error loading Office International DLL
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run Microsoft Office 97 Setup.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office 97 on your computer, a number of keys
are added to the registry. One of these keys, Mso97.dll, refers to the
location of the Mso97.dll file.
<P>
When you perform a Run From CD installation of Microsoft Office 97, the
Mso97.dll key in your Registry is set to refer to the folder on the compact
disc that contains Mso97.dll. If you then use the Remove All option in
Microsoft Office 97 Setup, the Mso97.dll key may not be removed.
<P>
This may cause problems if you then attempt to perform a Typical or Custom
installation of Microsoft Office 97.
