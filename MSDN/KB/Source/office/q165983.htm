The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Access 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Outlook 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start any of the programs that are listed at the beginning of this
article, sound events within the programs do not work, even though the
Microsoft Office 97 Sounds that are included in the ValuPack in Microsoft
Office 97 are installed on the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are using either of the following operating systems:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
      Microsoft Windows 95 (with user profiles)
</PRE><P>
   -and-

<LI>When the Microsoft Office 97 Sounds were installed, another user was
   logged on to the computer.
<P>
</UL>This problem occurs because the Setup program for Microsoft Office 97
Sounds creates registry keys for sound events in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER key,
which is user specific. Setup does not create this key under the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key, which applies to all users. Because of this, the
registry entries for the sound events are available only for the user who
installs Microsoft Office 97 Sounds.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If Microsoft Office 97 Sounds is used by multiple users who log on to the
computer, each person must install Microsoft Office 97 Sounds. Doing this
dos not require additional hard disk space because the Setup program always
copies the sound files to the same folder on the hard disk. When each
person installs the sound files, the Setup program creates the appropriate
keys in the registry so that each person can use the Microsoft Office 97
Sounds.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the Microsoft Office 97 Sounds Setup program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office 97 Sounds is one of the components that is included in the
Microsoft Office 97 ValuPack. When you install this component, Setup copies
sound files to your hard disk and creates registry entries that refer to
these sound files.
<P>
These registry entries establish certain events in the Microsoft Office 97
programs, such as Clear, Delete, Drag, and so on. When a specific event
occurs, the sound that is associated with that event is played. You can
choose what sounds are associated with each event by using the Sounds
Control Panel icon.
<P>
If you open the Sounds Control Panel icon and do not see Microsoft Office
in the list of events, you must install Microsoft Office 97 Sounds to use
the sound events.
