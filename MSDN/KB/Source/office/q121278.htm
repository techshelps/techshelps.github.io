The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office Assistant for Windows, version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you update the links to a Microsoft Excel version 5.0 document, you
may receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Application Error

   Excel caused a General Protection Fault in module EXCEL.EXE at 00B8:20c7

   Excel caused a General Protection Fault in POWERPNT.DLL at 00B9:01d4

</PRE>This problem may occur if you are using the OABPLAN.DOC Microsoft Word
document, or the OAWHATIF.PPT Microsoft PowerPoint slide, included in the
Office Assistant that ships with Microsoft Office version 4.3.
<P>
These symptoms can also occur if you are trying to open a Microsoft Word
document that has to update links to Microsoft Excel. You will get the
General Protection Fault in EXCEL.EXE as stated above. The cause may be a
WinFax Pro file (msexcel5.xls) in the XLSTART directory. WinFax Pro is
manufactured by Delrina.
<P>
Note that if you attempt to reregister applications, OLE errors may occur
until you launch the server application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The error occurs when Microsoft PowerPoint version 4.0 or Microsoft Word
version 6.0a attempts to re-establish the links to a Microsoft Excel
version 5.0 document that contains an embedded chart. The updating link
status bar in the dependent application appears to increase and then
results in one of the GP Fault errors stated above.
<P>
The presence of msexcel5.xls usually implies the presence of another Winfax
macro called msexcel4.xlm. This macro produces errors in OLE when Microsoft
Excel version 5.0 is the server application. Notably, deselecting a
Microsoft Excel version 5.0 worksheet object and attempting to delete it
from within the OLE client application may cause the Save As dialog box to
be displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, try either of the following.

<UL><LI>Reregister OLE2.REG, WINWORD6.REG, and EXCEL5.REG by double-clicking
   each of these files in File Manager.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If the error occurs while you are using the files from Microsoft Office
   Assistant, you can prevent the error by opening Microsoft Excel before
   you attempt to open the OAWHATIF.PPT and OABPLAN.DOC files.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If the error occurs and you have WinFax Pro installed, remove the file
   msexcel5.xls from the XLSTART directory. When you try to update the
   links now, it works fine. You can follow the workarounds and make sure
   that you have Microsoft Excel open. This allows the links to update
   properly. Rebuilding the REG.DAT file does not work in this case.
