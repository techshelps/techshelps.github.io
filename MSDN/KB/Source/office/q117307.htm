The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office Professional for Windows, version 4.3
<LI>Microsoft Access, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office Professional Setup, after the last disk
is loaded, your system has been updated, and Program Manager icons have
been created, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup couldn't create a SYSTEM.MDA file. After Setup is completed,
   reboot your computer, then run the Workgroup Administrator before you
   run this application. (-1809)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message appears when a file-sharing utility has not been loaded
prior to running Setup.
<P>
Setup uses a program called the Workgroup Administrator (WRKGADM.EXE) to
create the SYSTEM.MDA file. The Workgroup Administrator requires a file-
sharing utility such as SHARE.EXE or VSHARE.386 (the virtual device driver
file-sharing utility used in Windows 386 enhanced mode) to work correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To solve this problem, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>After Setup is complete, quit Microsoft Windows.

<P><LI>Follow the appropriate procedure for your version of Windows:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If you are running Windows version 3.1 in standard mode, make sure
      that SHARE.EXE is loaded in your AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS file, or
      load it at the MS-DOS command prompt.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If you are running Windows version 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups
      version 3.1 or later in 386 enhanced mode, make sure that VSHARE.386
      is loaded in the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Start Microsoft Windows. Start the Workgroup Administrator by double-
   clicking the MS Access Workgroup Administrator icon, and choose the
   Create button.

<P><LI>In the Workgroup Owner Information dialog box, choose OK. In the
   Workgroup System Database dialog box, choose OK.
<P>
   You will be given the option to create a new SYSTEM.MDA file. When you
   choose Yes in this dialog box, a new SYSTEM.MDA file is created for you.
<P>
   NOTE: Name, Organization, and WorkgroupId must be entered before a new
   SYSTEM.MDA file can be created.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Access.
<P>
</OL>Microsoft Access must have a valid SYSTEM.MDA file to work correctly. If
you try to start Microsoft Access before you create the SYSTEM.MDA file,
you will receive either of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Couldn't find file 'C:\ACCESS\system.mda'.

   -or-

   Cannot open &lt;path&gt;\system.mda.

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
