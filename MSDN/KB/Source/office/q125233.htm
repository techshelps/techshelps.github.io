</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In versions of Microsoft applications previous to Microsoft Office version
4.2, files that were shared among programs were installed in the Microsoft
folder in the System Folder:Extensions folder. This Microsoft folder may
still contain some files after you install Microsoft Office version 4.2 so
that previous versions of other Microsoft applications continue to work. To
save disk space, you may be able to delete some of these files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following tables list filenames under the names of the applications
that use these files. If you no longer use the versions of the programs
listed in these headings, you can delete the corresponding files by
dragging them to the trash.
<P>
Microsoft Excel 4.0, PowerPoint 3.0, Microsoft Works 3.0, and all versions
of Microsoft FoxPro and Microsoft Project

</PRE>Microsoft Excel 4.0, PowerPoint 3.0, Microsoft Works 3.0, and all versions
of Microsoft Project

</PRE>After you remove the files that you will no longer use, if there are no
files in the old Microsoft folder, you can safely drag the folder to the
trash. You do not need to delete any of the files above in order for
Microsoft Office or the Microsoft Office applications to work.
<P>
NOTE: You should not move any of the Microsoft Office files to this old
location. Microsoft Office version 4.2 uses the Microsoft folder located at
the same "level" as the Microsoft Office folder.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office, the Setup program detects previous
versions of the Office applications that are installed on your computer,
and asks if you want to remove them. This allows you to free up disk space
on your computer. However, not all of the files used by these applications
are removed (because they may still be used by other applications).
