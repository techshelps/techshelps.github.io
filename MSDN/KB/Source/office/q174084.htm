The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows, Service Release 1 (SR-1)
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Patch to update an installation
of Microsoft Office 97, the programs included in Microsoft Office 97 may
not be updated, and problems that should be corrected by installing the
patch are not corrected.
<P>
When this problem occurs, you do not receive an error message. However, the
patch log file, 97sr1_0.txt, contains the following messages:
<P>
<PRE>   error ept0034:
   Neither command line parameter specified is an existing directory.

   -and-

   warning wpt0015:
   Old File does not exist

</PRE>NOTE: The log file is created in the Office folder in the Microsoft Office
folder.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the path to Microsoft Office 97 or one of the
Microsoft Office 97 programs contains any extended non-English characters.
For example, the problem occurs if the path includes characters with acute
or grave accents, umlauts, tildes, cedillas, or circumflexes.
<P>
NOTE: Although these characters cannot be displayed here in the Knowledge
Base, you can see them by running the Character Map (Charmap.exe) program
that is included with Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT. When
you view the characters in the Arial font, many of the extended characters
appear in the last two rows of the Character Map program.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Determining Whether the Problem Has Occurred</h3>
 
<P>
If the path to Microsoft Office 97 on your computer includes extended
characters, open the patch log file, 97sr1_0.txt, and check for the
presence of the messages described in the "Symptoms" section in this
article. If either of the messages appear in the log file, the problem has
occurred.
<P>
<P><h3>Working Around the Problem</h3>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1:
<P>
If possible, remove Microsoft Office 97 from your computer, and then
reinstall Microsoft Office 97 in a location with a path that does not
include extended characters. After you reinstall Microsoft Office 97,
reinstall the patch. The new patch log file that is created should not
contain any error messages.
<P>
To remove Office 97, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, Point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>Click the Install/Uninstall tab, click Microsoft Office 97 in the list
   of installed programs, and then click Add/Remove.
<P>
</OL>Method 2:
<P>
If you cannot reinstall Microsoft Office 97 in a location that uses a path
that does not include extended characters, contact the Microsoft Technical
Support center in your specific country. If you are outside the United
States, contact the Microsoft subsidiary for your area. To locate your
subsidiary, see the Microsoft World Wide Offices Web site at:

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft product that
is listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The patch program records a log file of all the actions it performs. The
log file is named 97sr1_0.txt and is created in the Office folder in the
Microsoft Office folder (the default is Program Files\Microsoft
Office\Office). If you run the patch more than once, additional log files
are created with the names 97sr1_1.txt, 97sr1_2.txt, and so on.
<P>
The default path for Microsoft Office 97, which is C:\Program
Files\Microsoft Office, does not include any extended characters.
<P>
