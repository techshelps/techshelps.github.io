</PRE>REDMOND, Wash. - July 1, 1996 - Microsoft Corp. today announced a no-charge
offering for users of Macintosh computers, The Microsoft Empowerment Pack
for the Mac provides users with a powerful set of tools designed to enhance
their presence on the Internet, increase their computer's performance, and
improve their system's memory. It includes Microsoft Internet Explorer
version 2.0 for the Macintosh, which uses fewer system resources than any
other Mac browser; Internet Assistant 2.0 for Microsoft Word for the
Macintosh, which enables users to turn their Word documents into Web pages
with just a few clicks; Internet Assistant for Microsoft Excel for the
Macintosh, enabling users to create and share spreadsheets online; the
Microsoft Word 6.0.1a Update for the Macintosh, which improves a system's
performance and stability; the Apple System 7.5 Update 2.0 and System 7.5.3
Revision 2 from Apple Computer Inc.; and a special memory offer from
Kingston Technology Corp. of 8 MB of desktop memory for only $69 - a
savings of as much as $100.

"The Microsoft Empowerment Pack for the Mac is part of our ongoing effort
to bring our customers new, powerful technology that improves their overall
experience with the Office applications," said Dave Meltzer, group product
manager for Macintosh applications at Microsoft. "The tools in The
Microsoft Empowerment Pack improve performance and make it possible to
bring the Internet to the desktop with easy-to-use, familiar Microsoft
programs that our customers are comfortable with."

"We're happy to be working with Microsoft to get the latest refinement of
our operating system into the hands of our mutual customers," said Jim
