The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you add a button to the Office Shortcut Bar, the button is added to
the end of the toolbar, instead of at the location you specify on the
toolbar.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you add a file or folder as a button to a toolbar on the Office
Shortcut Bar using the Customize dialog box, the button is added to the end
of the toolbar, instead of to the location indicated in the Customize
dialog box.
<P>
The Buttons tab in the Customize dialog box displays a list of the buttons
on the selected toolbar on the Shortcut Bar. When you select an item in the
"Show These Files As Buttons" list and you use the Add File or Add Folder
button to add an additional button, the file or folder you select is added
above the selected item in the list. However, the button for the file or
folder is added to the end of the toolbar on the Shortcut bar.
<P>
Additionally, if you delete the button that you just added to the "Show
These Files As Buttons" list, the wrong item may be deleted.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, you can modify the location of the button
that you added to a toolbar on the Office Shortcut Bar by using one of the
following methods:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
1. Click the right mouse button on the Office Shortcut Bar.

<OL><P><LI>Click Customize.

<P><LI>Click the Buttons tab. In the Toolbar list, click the toolbar that
   contains the button that you want to move.

<P><LI>In the "Show These Files As Buttons" list, click the button that
   you want to move, and click the Up Arrow or Down Arrow button
   until the item is in the desired location.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
To move a button to a different position on the toolbar, all you have to do
is hold down the &lt;ALT&gt; key and drag the button on the toolbar to the
desired location.
<P>
Additionally, you can create spaces on the toolbar by ALT + dragging a
button approximately half of a button width away from a neighboring button,
and you can delete spaces by alt + dragging a neighboring button over the
space.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Normally, the order of the items displayed in the "Show These Files As
Buttons" list (on the Buttons tab in the Customize dialog box) represents
the location of these buttons on the toolbar. However, when you add a file
or folder to a toolbar, the item appears above the selected item in the
"Show These Files As Buttons" list, even though button that is added
appears at the end of the toolbar. When you display the Customize dialog
box again, the button is correctly displayed at the end of the "Show These
Files As Buttons" list.
<P>
When you delete a button that you have just added in the Customize dialog
box, you receive a dialog box with the following message when you close the
Customize dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   Are you sure you want to delete the buttons listed below? The
   programs, files, and content of any folders that are represented by
   the deleted button will be permanently lost.
   &lt;item name&gt;

</PRE></OL>Make sure that &lt;item name&gt; is the item that you intended to delete. Because
of the behavior described above, the incorrect item may be removed when you
delete a button that you just added using the Customize dialog box.
