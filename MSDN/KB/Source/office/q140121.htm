The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Small Business Pack for Windows 95, version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have installed the Microsoft Small Business Pack, and you run Setup
in maintenance mode and you select the Reinstall option, you may receive
the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Setup Error 998: Object &lt;number&gt;: Your Setup Files may be damaged. Try
   restarting the Setup Program.

</PRE>where &lt;number&gt; is the number 293 or 294.
<P>
When you receive this error message, your only option is to click OK.
When you click OK, you receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Small Business Pack Setup was completed Successfully

</PRE>If you run Setup one more time, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you then click the Details button, you get the message:
<P>
<PRE>   ACMESETUP caused an invalid page fault in module SBP.dll at
   &lt;memory address&gt;

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you have partitioned your hard disk or are using
more than one hard disk and Windows is installed to one partition (or
drive) while Microsoft Office and Small Business Pack are installed on
another partition (or drive). For example, this problem will occur if
Windows is installed on your C drive and Microsoft Office and Small
Business Pack are installed on your D drive.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, remove both Microsoft Office and Small Business
Pack from the drive partition (or the alternate drive) and reinstall them
both to the drive where Windows is installed. For example, remove Microsoft
Office and Small Business Pack from the D drive, and reinstall them to the
C drive.
<P>
If you receive the invalid page fault error message, you may be able to
temporarily work around this situation by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>Rename the Setup.stf file that is located in the in the MSOffice\Small
   Business Pack\Setup folder (the default location of this file) to
   "Setup.xxx" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Run the Small Business Pack Setup program from Disk 1 and install it to
   the same folder where you previously installed Small Business Pack.
<P></OL>
