The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start one of the Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition programs,
you may experience one of the following problems:

<UL><LI>You receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The application &lt;Program Name&gt; has unexpectedly quit, because an
      error of type 3 occurred.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      You should save your work in other open applications and restart the
      computer.
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;Program Name&gt; is the name of the Office Program that you are
   starting.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The startup screen for the Office program appears briefly, but the
   program does not start.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems will occur if an older version of the file Microsoft
Component Library exists in the System Folder:Extensions folder. Office 98
installs version 2.22 of the file Microsoft Component library.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve the problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the System Folder:Extensions folder.

<P><LI>Move the file Microsoft Component Library to the Trash.

<P><LI>Click Empty Trash on the Special menu.

<P><LI>Start any of the Office 98 programs.
<P>
</OL>The first run installation process will run; then, the Office program will
be started.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To find the version number of the file Microsoft Component Library, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the System Folder:Extensions folder.

<P><LI>Click Microsoft Component Library.

<P><LI>Click Get Info on the File menu.
<P>
</OL>The version number of the file is listed in the Info window. If the version
number of the file is less that 2.22, you need to follow the steps listed
in the "Workaround" section of this article.
<P>
Other programs may install a version of Microsoft Component Library that is
not compatible with Office 98. For example, when you install the full
version of Macintosh operating system 8.1, version 2.20 of Microsoft
Component Library is placed in the System Folder:Extensions:MS Library
Folder folder. Normally, this would not cause a conflict with the Office 98
programs. However, if this version of the file is moved into the System
Folder:Extensions folder, you will experience the problems described in the
"Symptoms" section of this article.
<P>
If you have any version of Microsoft Component Library in the System
Folder:Extensions:MS Library Folder folder, it will be removed if the first
run installation process runs.
<P>
For additional information on the first run installation process, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
