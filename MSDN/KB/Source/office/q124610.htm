<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was published as part two of a five-part
series in the 1.2.95 issue of MacWeek.
<P>
<P><h2>TIPS AND TRICKS FOR MICROSOFT OFFICE VERSION 4.2</h2>
 
<P>
Dear Mac User:
<P>
This is part two of a five-part series of tips and tricks about
Microsoft Office Standard version 4.2 (which includes Microsoft Excel
5.0, Word 6.0, PowerPoint 4.0 and a Microsoft Mail 3.1 workstation
license). We hope you will find this information useful as you
upgrade your organization to Office Standard version 4.2
<P>

</PRE><h2>PART 2:  RAM ISSUES ON 68K AND POWER MACINTOSH</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>How Much RAM Do I Need?</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft lists random-access memory (RAM) requirements on product
packaging based on the total RAM you'll need on your Macintosh
computer. The total RAM you need to run an individual program will be
the sum of the partition size (see table below), plus the size of
your operating system and any other system extensions you have
running.
<P>
<PRE> PRODUCT               68K MACINTOSH              POWER MACINTOSH*
 ==========================================================================
 Microsoft Excel 5.0   2.8                        4
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Word 6.0              1.7 minimum, 3 preferred   2 minimum, 3 preferred
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PowerPoint 4.0        2.8 minimum, 4 preferred   1.5 minimum, 2.5
                                                  preferred
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * With virtual memory on

</PRE>Microsoft Excel and Word can run with a compact System 7.0 or 7.1
installation on a 4 MB Macintosh, but will perform better with more
memory.
<P>
<P><h3>Running Programs Together</h3>
 
<P>
Many Macintosh users are used to launching a program, using it, and
shutting it down before launching another. This can result in the
need to launch a program many times in a day. Using RAM Doubler on a
68K Macintosh, or RAM Doubler or virtual memory on a Power Macintosh,
you can keep more programs open without having to relaunch. This is
because as additional programs are launched which require more than
the physical memory of the computer, the nonactive programs "spill
over" onto disk. Switching back to these programs activates their
retrieval from disk, which is faster than relaunching.
<P>
Using two or more programs together requires that enough RAM
(physical or virtual) be available to cover the sum of the partition
spaces needed. The use of OLE technology, (which enables dragging and
dropping of objects between programs, visual editing, and linking)
requires some additional RAM beyond the sum of the partition sizes.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Virtual Memory on a Power Macintosh</h3>
 
<P>
The Get Info command on a Power Macintosh will show the size of the
program's data space, plus the program code that is loaded into
memory. With virtual memory off, the entire code base must be loaded
at once because code segments are not swapped to disk as they are on
a 68K Macintosh (where virtual memory is typically off). With virtual
memory on, the Power Macintosh operating system becomes more flexible
in the way that code is loaded and used, therefore maximizing the
memory available. Hence with a Power Macintosh, virtual memory (or
RAM Doubler) should always be used.

 C = Microsoft Excel code                  L = Shared Libraries with Office

</PRE>A Power Macintosh with 16 MB or less must have virtual memory or RAM
Doubler on, but Virtual Memory or RAM Doubler makes any Power
Macintosh more flexible. On a 68K Macintosh, program code is swapped
to disk even without virtual memory.
<P>
<P><h2>FEATURE TIP</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Connectix RAM Doubler Included FREE</h3>
 
<P>
RAM Doubler is a memory utility from Connectix Corporation. This
product works on a regular Macintosh and in place of virtual memory
on a Power Macintosh. RAM Doubler will compress memory that's not
being used before writing it off to disk to minimize hard drive usage
and improve performance. If you received RAM Doubler version 1.0.4
for Macintosh with Microsoft Office Standard 4.2, you can upgrade to
version 1.5.1 for Macintosh or Power Macintosh at no charge by
downloading it from the Microsoft bulletin board system at (425)
936-6735 (search on "Doubler"). Or, when you fulfill the Power
Macintosh native disks for Office, version 1.5.1 will be included on
that customer service disk set - just send in the coupon in your
Office Standard box.
<P>
Look out for Part 3 coming in the next issue! The topic will be Power
Macintosh performance.
