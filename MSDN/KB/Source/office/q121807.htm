The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3c-CD
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.2-CD
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office Setup program, you may receive the
following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Setup does not support being run in this mode

</PRE>followed by either
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Office Setup was not completed successfully

</PRE>or:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Office and Bookshelf Setup was not completed successfully


</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Run the SETUP.EXE program located in the DISK1 directory of the
   SETUP.ADM directory on the CD without the /a switch (administrative
   installation). The Setup program located in this directory is designed
   only for an administrative installation, and will not allow you to run
   Setup without using the /a switch.
<P>
</UL>Note that in previous versions of Microsoft Office on CD, you do not
receive an error message if you run the SETUP.EXE program located in
the DISK1 directory of the SETUP.ADM directory on the CD without the
/a switch. However, this method of running Setup is not supported by
Microsoft.
<P>
<PRE>   -or-

</PRE><LI>Run the SETUP.EXE program located in the root directory of the CD using
   the /a switch. The Setup program located in the root directory of the CD
   is designed only for a regular installation, and will not allow you to
   run Setup using the /a switch.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this behavior, use the appropriate workaround below:

<UL><LI>To perform an administrative installation of Microsoft Office, run the
   SETUP.EXE program located in the SETUP.ADM\DISK1 subdirectory of the
   CD, using the /a switch. For example, use the following command line:
<P>
   setup /a
<P>
   -or-

<LI>To perform a regular installation of Microsoft Office, run the SETUP.EXE
   program located on the root directory of the CD. Do not use the /a
   switch.
