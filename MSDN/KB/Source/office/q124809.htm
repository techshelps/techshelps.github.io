               Component

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that you should restart your Macintosh while holding down the SHIFT
key to disable extensions before running Setup with either of the following
methods.
<P>
<P><h3>To Reinstall Office</h3>
 
<P>
If one of the Microsoft Office files becomes damaged after you have
installed Office, follow these steps to reinstall Office:

<OL><P><LI>In the Finder, rename the damaged files.

<P><LI>Run Microsoft Office Setup again from the Microsoft Office Install Disk
   1 or from the network server directory from which you originally
   installed the program.
<P>
   The Setup program detects that Microsoft Office has already been
   installed, and starts the Microsoft Office Setup installation
   maintenance program.

<P><LI>When the Microsoft Office Setup dialog box appears, click Reinstall.
<P>
   This procedure repeats your last installation. Setup detects the files
   that exist and replaces only the missing files. (Setup does not detect
   renamed files and replaces them.)
<P>
   Once the reinstallation is complete, the Microsoft Office Setup program
   will restart your Macintosh.
<P>
</OL><h3>To Add a Single Program</h3>

   Add/Remove button.

   program that you want to add, and then click the Continue button.

   next to the program name to display a list of the program
   options. Select the items that you want to add.

<P><LI>Click the Continue button.

   The Microsoft Office Setup program will prompt you for the disks that
   it needs in order to add the files for the selected programs.

Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h3>To Remove a Single Program</h3>
 
<P>
To remove a program, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run Microsoft Office Setup again from the Microsoft Office Install
   Disk 1, or from the network server directory from which you originally
   installed the program.

   The Setup program detects that Microsoft Office has already been
   installed, and starts the Microsoft Office Setup installation
   maintenance program.

   an Installed Components list.

   program that you want to remove, and then click Continue.
