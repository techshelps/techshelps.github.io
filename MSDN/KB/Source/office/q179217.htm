</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition includes features that help you
manage shared extension and preference files. This article explains how to
use these features to troubleshoot problems that may occur in Microsoft
Office 98 Macintosh Edition programs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>First Run Installation Process</h3>
 
<P>
The first run installation process is started the first time you start an
Office program after you perform a drag-and-drop installation of Office.
Under normal conditions, the first run installation process is not
restarted.
<P>
The first run installation process is automatically started when you start
a Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition program if any of the following
files are not present in the System Folder:Extensions folder:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Component Library
   Microsoft OLE Automation
   Microsoft OLE Library
   Microsoft Structured Storage

</PRE>The first run installation process checks for the existence of these files
in the System folder. Files that are missing from the System Folder are
copied to the correct location.
<P>
NOTE: The first run installation process replaces existing files only if
the existing files are earlier versions.
<P>
The files that are copied to the System Folder during the first run
installation process are listed in the following table.

</PRE>NOTE: During the first run installation process, a file named Installer
Cleanup Extension is created in the Extensions folder. This file is deleted
the next time that you restart the computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the First Run Installation Process to Troubleshoot Extension Files</h3>
 
<P>
You can use the first run installation process when you suspect that an
extension file that is required by Office is damaged. If you suspect that
an extension file that is required by Office is damaged, replace the file
by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Move the extension in question from the System Folder:Extensions folder
   to the desktop.

<P><LI>Delete the Microsoft Component Library file from the System
   Folder:Extensions folder.

<P><LI>Start any Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition program.
<P>
</OL>The first run installation process is started, and the missing extension
files are replaced.
<P>
<P><h3>First Run Registration Process</h3>
 
<P>
During the first run registration process, Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh
Edition program components are registered and default preference files are
created. The first run registration process is executed the first time that
you start an Office program.
<P>
To determine whether the first run registration process is running, verify
whether the following message appears on the startup screen:
<P>
<PRE>   Configuring Office Components....

</PRE></OL>The files that are created during the first run registration process are
listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   File name                       Creation time
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Microsoft Office Settings (8)   First time an Office program is started
   Office Registration Cache       First time an Office program is started
   PPC Registration Database       First time an Office program is started
   Excel Settings (8)              First time Excel is started
   Custom Dictionary               First time Microsoft Word is started
   Embedding Preferences           First time Word is started
   MS Office ACL (8)               First time Word is started
   Word Font Menu Cache (8)        First time Word is started
   Word Settings (8)               First time Word is started
   PowerPoint Settings (8)         First time Microsoft PowerPoint is
                                   started

</PRE>The first run registration process is automatically started when you start
an Office program after you do any of the following:

<UL><LI>You rename the Microsoft Office 98 folder.

<LI>You move the Microsoft Office 98 folder.

<LI>You change the name of the hard disk. (The default name is "Macintosh
   HD.")

<LI>The contents of the Microsoft Office 98:Office folder change.

<LI>You move or delete the Office Registration Cache or the PPC Registration
   Database file from the Preferences folder.
<P>
</UL><h3>Using the First Run Registration Process to Troubleshoot Preference Files</h3>
 
<P>
You can use the first run registration process to troubleshoot problems
with preference files. For example, if you receive an error message while
you are attempting to insert a Microsoft Graph object into a Microsoft Word
document, you can register Microsoft Graph by using the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Word.

<P><LI>Move the Office Registration Cache and PPC Registration Database files
   from the System Folder:Preferences folder to the desktop.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Word.
<P>
</OL>The first run registration process is automatically started, and the Office
Registration Cache and PPC Registration Database files are rebuilt.
