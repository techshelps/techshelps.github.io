The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows, Service Release 1 (SR-1)
<LI>Microsoft Project 98 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install the Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Patch, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Patch has reviewed the following installed
   Microsoft Office applications on this machine. If an application has
   been updated or is a newer version, the patch will not update that
   application.

</PRE>The "Applications that will not be updated" box contains the following
item:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Office 97 Support Files

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you previously installed Microsoft Project 98 for
Windows on your computer.
<P>
Specifically, the problem occurs because Microsoft Project 98 for Windows
includes newer versions of the following Microsoft Office 97 Support Files:
<P>
<PRE>   Mso97.dll
   Mso7enu.dll

</PRE>Because the files are newer than the files that are included in Microsoft
Office 97 for Windows, they cannot be updated by the SR-1 Patch.
<P>
NOTE: If you install Microsoft Project 98 for Windows AFTER you install the
Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Patch, you do not receive these error messages.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>You Previously Installed the Patch</h3>
 
<P>
If you previously installed the SR-1 Patch, use the solution in the
Resolution" section of the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../OFFICE/Q173711.htm">Q173711</A></B>
   TITLE     : OFF97: Buttons in Close Dialog Incorrect After Upgrading to
               SR-1

</PRE><h3>You Did Not Install the Patch</h3>
 
<P>
If you did not previously install the patch or if you clicked Exit Patch
when the message appeared, use either of the following methods to update
Microsoft Office 97:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI> If the SR-1 Patch is running, exit the patch.

<P><LI> Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to display the Close Program dialog box. If OSA
     appears in the list, select it, and then click End Task.

<P><LI> Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to display the Close Program dialog box. If
     Findfast appears in the list, select it, and then click End Task.
<P>
     If another dialog box appears, click End Task.

<P><LI> Insert the Microsoft Office 97 compact disc into your CD-ROM drive.
     Use Microsoft Windows Explorer to open the following folder on the
     CD-ROM drive
<P>
<PRE>        &lt;Drive&gt;:\Office

     where &lt;Drive&gt; is the drive letter for your CD-ROM drive. For example,
     if your CD-ROM drive letter is D, open the following folder:

        D:\Office

</PRE><P><LI> On the View menu, click Options. Click the View tab. Click Show
     All Files and click OK.

<P><LI> Right-click the Mso97.dll file. On the shortcut menu, click Copy.

<P><LI> Use Windows Explorer to open the following folder on your hard disk:
<P>
<PRE>        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office

</PRE><P><LI> On the Edit menu, click Paste.

<P><LI> Repeat steps 4 through 8. In step 5, copy the Mso7enu.dll file
     instead of the Mso97.dll file.

<P><LI>After you copy Mso97.dll and Mso7enu.dll to your hard disk, run the
    Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Patch.
<P>
    The patch should indicate that the Microsoft Office 97 Support Files
    will be updated.

<P><LI>After the SR-1 Patch is finished, repeat steps 2 through 9. However, in
    step 4, insert the Microsoft Project 98 compact disc instead of the
    Microsoft Office 97 compact disc.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Instead of using the SR-1 Patch, upgrade your version of Microsoft Office
97 by obtaining and installing the Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Enterprise
Update. The SR-1 Enterprise Update contains a complete, updated version of
Microsoft Office 97. If you install Office from this compact disc,
installing the SR-1 Patch is not necessary.
<P>
You can obtain the Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Enterprise Update on compact
disc by contacting the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561 or by
contacting Microsoft Technical Support. Outside the United States and
Canada, contact your local Microsoft subsidiary for information about the
Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Enterprise Update.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Patch determines if specific files must be
updated. Because the Mso97.dll and Mso7enu.dll files that are included in
Microsoft Project 98 for Windows are newer than the Mso97.dll and
Mso7enu.dll files included in Microsoft Office 97 for Windows, the SR-1
Patch cannot update the newer files.
<P>
This behavior may cause problems when you run any of the programs included
in Microsoft Office 97 for Windows or when you run Microsoft Project 98 for
Windows.
<P>
If you use Method 1, the SR-1 Patch is installed correctly, and the
Mso97.dll and Mso7enu.dll files included in Microsoft Project 98 for
Windows work correctly with the programs included in Microsoft Office 97.
