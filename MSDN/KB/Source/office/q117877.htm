The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the jumps or cross-references in the SUPPORT.MVB file that
ships with the Office 4.3-CD (retail), you may not be able to access the
information you need.
<P>
Some situations where jumps and cross-references do not work correctly
include the following:

<UL><LI>After you switch to the SUPPORT.MVB file (select a support item from
   the initial Contents list), the arrows at the top of the viewer appear
   to be available. However, when you click these buttons, the Help screen
   is unchanged.
<P>
   Note also that the Contents button is unavailable, and you cannot switch
   to an individual application User's Guide or the Microsoft Office
   contents screen.

<LI>When you select technical support from "Microsoft Access User's Guide,"
   Appendix E, you receive the error message "Help Topic Does Not Exist"
   and you are switched to the Microsoft Word support section.

<LI>When you select technical support from the "Microsoft Excel User's
   Guide" you are switched to the correct initial page of Microsoft Excel
   support, but you cannot access any of the six other support pages.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The support information in SUPPORT.MVB is the same as the information in
the Help for the individual Office applications. You can access this
information from the individual application by choosing Technical Support
from the Help menu, or by choosing Product/Technical Support from the
Contents page in Help for the particular application you want information
about.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
