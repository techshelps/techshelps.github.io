The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office Resource Kit for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you run the Network Installation Wizard included in the Office
Resource Kit (ORK), and you then quit the wizard, this action may delete
the Newsetup.stf file. This problem occurs if the Newsetup.stf file is
located in the same folder as the administrative Setup.stf file that the
wizard modifies.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Network Installation Wizard, it checks to see if you
already have a file called Newsetup.stf in the same folder as the Setup.stf
file that the wizard modifies. If you quit the wizard, this deletes the
Newsetup.stf file, if it exists.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you run the Network Installation Wizard, cancel out of the wizard, and
then notice that your Newsetup.stf file has been deleted, you will have to
re-create a new one using the Network Installation Wizard.
<P>
If you have a modified .stf file called Newsetup.stf in the same folder as
the admin Setup.stf, and you have not yet run the Network Installation
Wizard again (meaning after the initial installation), make sure you create
a backup of the file Newsetup.stf. Then, if you accidentally delete the
file, you can always make a copy of this backup, and rename it
Newsetup.stf.
<P>
You can also work around this problem by obtaining the Network Installation
Wizard, version 1.1 or later.  Netinst.exe, a self-extracting file,
contains version 1.1 of the wizard. You can download the file from the
following services:

listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
