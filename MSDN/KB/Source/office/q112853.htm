The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.2, 4.3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office 4.2 or 4.3 on a server and the server
contains an installation of Microsoft Office 4.0, you must install to an
empty directory on the network server in order keep from updating network
files that may still be in use.
<P>
How you decide to update the workstation will affect the way you need to
install Office. You can uninstall version 4.0 from each workstation and
install the new version from the server, or you can update the workstation
from the Office directory.
<P>
Depending on how you decide to update the workstations, do one of the
following:

<UL><LI>Install the new version of Office to a new server directory.
<P>
   NOTE: Be aware that when you use this method, you must uninstall 4.0
   from each individual workstation and then install the new version
   from the directory on the server. This procedure may take some time.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Make sure that all users are not on the system and delete the Office 4.0
   directory from the server before you install the new version.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you do not uninstall 4.0 from each workstation, you may run into the
following issues:

<UL><LI>OLE objects may have more than one entry in the REG.DAT file to reflect
   earlier versions of Office applications. For instance, if you select
<PRE>   'Excel Macrosheet' (an Excel 4.0 object) under Insert Object, Word 6.0
   embeds an Excel 5.0 workbook. (This change to Microsoft Excel 5.0 may be
   unexpected.)

</PRE><LI>If the Office 4.0 installation ran shared applications from the local
   hard drive, and the new version runs them from the network, an earlier
   version of a tool may be started when the user inserts objects. Because
   the REG.DAT entries for the local tools are still valid, they are not
   updated to point to the new tool on the server.

<LI>Old program icons (such as Q+E and Dialog Editor) are still in the
   program group, though their paths may no longer be valid.
<P>
</UL>Uninstalling Office 4.0 from each workstation and running the new version
of Office setup from the server will bypass the above issues while leaving
user preference files intact; however, it may be laborious to run the
install program twice on each workstation.
