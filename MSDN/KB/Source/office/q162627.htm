</PRE><P>
   Then, click the yellow folder to the left of "Vba332.dll." The text in
   the status bar should be the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      My Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools

<P>
<P><PRE>      Program Files\Common Files
      Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared
      Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\VBA
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The Program Files folder should already exist on your hard disk.
   If it does not, create it before you create the folders listed in this
   step.

<P><LI>Copy the following files from the OS\System folder on your Microsoft
   Office 97 compact disc:
<P>
<PRE>      Vba332.dll     (file size 1,596,688 bytes, version 3.0.6908, 11/96)
      Vbe.dll        (file size 745,232 bytes, 11/96)

   Paste the files in the Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft
   Shared\VBAfolder on your hard disk.

</PRE><P><LI>In the Windows Explorer, go to the Windows\System folder on your hard
   disk.
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. If the file Oleaut32.dll is present, select it. Right-click the
       file, and click Rename on the shortcut menu. Type
       "Oleaut32.old" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. If the Ole32.dll file is present, select it. Right-click the
       file, and click Rename on the shortcut menu. Type "Ole32.old"
       (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Copy the following file from the OS\System folder on your Microsoft
   Office 97 compact disc:
<P>
<PRE>      Oleaut32.dll   (file size 491,792 bytes, version 2.20.4054,
                     11/96)

   Paste the file in the Windows\System folder on your hard disk.

</PRE><P><LI>Copy the following file from the Office\WMS\Common folder on your
   Microsoft Office 97 compact disc:
<P>
<PRE>      Ole32.dll      (file size 558,704 bytes, version 2.1, 11/96)

   Paste the file in the Windows\System folder on your hard disk.

   NOTE: If any of the four files mentioned in steps 2-4 are in use, you
   may receive an error message when you attempt to copy them to your hard
   disk. If this occurs, you may need to restart your computer in MS-DOS
   mode, copy the files to your hard disk, and then restart your computer
   again.

</PRE><P><LI>Run Microsoft Office 97 Setup.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: After replacing the old copies of Oleaut32.dll and Ole32.dll
with copies from the Microsoft Office 97 compact disc and running
Microsoft Office 97 Setup, other programs that use these files may not
work correctly. In this event, you may need to reinstall the other
programs. Or, you may be able to rename the .old files in the
Windows\Systemfolder to their original file names.
