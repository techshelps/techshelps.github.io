The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use Orphan Finder, which is included in Quarterdeck CleanSweep 3.0,
to remove orphaned dynamic link library (DLL) files from your computer, and
then use the programs included with Microsoft Office 97, any of the
following symptoms may occur:

<UL><LI>If you attempt to display the Visual Basic Editor in Microsoft Excel
   97, the Visual Basic Editor does not appear on the screen, and you do
   not receive an error message.

<LI>If you attempt to display the Visual Basic Editor in Microsoft Word 97,
   you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Could not open macro storage.
</PRE><P>
   When the Visual Basic Editor appears, you cannot work with modules,
   UserForms, or class modules.

<LI>If you attempt to display the Visual Basic Editor in Microsoft
   PowerPoint 97, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      PowerPoint found an error that it can't correct. You should save
      presentations, exit, and then restart PowerPoint.
</PRE><P>
   The Visual Basic Editor does not appear.

<LI>If you attempt to insert a control in Microsoft Excel 97, you may
   receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Visual Basic
      Can't find file 'FM20.DLL'
</PRE>
<LI>If you attempt to insert a control in Microsoft Word 97, the control
   may not appear, and you do not receive an error message.

<LI>If you attempt to insert a control in Microsoft PowerPoint 97, you may
   receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      An unknown error occurred during creation of ActiveX Control.
</PRE>
<LI>When you restart your computer, you may receive the following error
   message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Error Starting Program
      A required .DLL file, TIPS.DLL, was not found.
</PRE>
<LI>When you use Help in any of the programs included in Microsoft Office
   97, you may receive one or more of the following error messages:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Windows Help
      Cannot find or load the file HLP95EN.DLL. This file should be copied
      to C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM or a directory in your PATH.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      An error exists in this Help file. Contact your application vendor
      for an updated Help file. (1024)
</PRE>
<LI>When you attempt to create a new query in Microsoft Excel 97, or when
   you attempt to start Microsoft Query 97, you may receive one or more
   of the following error messages:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ODBC Driver Manager
      Failed to load resource DLL odbcint.dll
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The ODBC32.DLL file cannot start.
      Check the file to determine the problem.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Excel could not start Microsoft Query because it is not
      installed. To install it, run Setup again and select the Microsoft
      Query option in the Data Access category. If Microsoft Query is
      already installed, run it standalone to force it to register with
      the system.
</PRE><P>
   You receive this error message even though Microsoft Query 97 is
   installed on the computer.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because Orphan Finder incorrectly identifies many DLL
files as orphaned files even though they are used by programs included with
Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
If you allow Orphan Finder to remove these DLL files, the features provided
by these files are no longer available in the programs included with
Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
NOTE: Orphaned files are files that remain after you remove the program
that originally installed them.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, use either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program and click Reinstall. When you do
this, the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program installs new copies of the
removed DLL files.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
If you allowed Orphan Finder to make backup copies of the removed DLL
files, you can use Orphan Finder to restore the copies of the DLL files.
<P>
Note that it may be necessary to reinstall other programs if Orphan Finder
removed their DLL files.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you use the products listed at the beginning of
this article and the Orphan Finder in Quarterdeck CleanSweep 3.0 to
identify and remove orphaned DLL files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In CleanSweep 3.0, you can access the Orphan Finder by clicking the Cleanup
tab, and then clicking Orphan Finder. When you run Orphan Finder, it scans
your computer and locates orphaned DLL files, .ini files, zero-byte files,
and other items that remain after you remove the program that originally
installed them.
<P>
If you allow Orphan Finder to remove orphaned DLL files, the program
prompts you to create backup copies of the DLL files before you remove them
so that you can restore them in the event of a problem. Use caution when
you use Orphan Finder to remove DLL files that may still be in use by
Microsoft Office 97 or other programs.
<P>
CleanSweep 3.0 is manufactured by Quarterdeck Corporation, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
