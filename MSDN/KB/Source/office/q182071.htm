<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) to start any of the
Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition programs listed at the beginning of
this article, the program may not start. However, if you try to start the
same program from the Microsoft Office Manager a second time, the program
starts.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
An Office 98 program may not start the first time you click it on the
Microsoft Office Manager menu because a process called the "first run
installation process" may have been started when you click the Office
program on the menu.
<P>
Normally, if the first run installation process is started for any reason,
the program that you attempt to start is stopped to allow the first run
installation process to finish, and then the Office program is restarted.
However, the first run installation process may not be able to restart an
Office 98 program if you have started that program from the Microsoft
Office Manager menu.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, try clicking the program again on the
Microsoft Office Manager menu. The program should start the second time
because the first run installation process does not run again.
<P>
This problem may be due to some corruption in the desktop file; therefore,
you may want to consider rebuilding the desktop. To rebuild the desktop,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Restart the computer.

<P><LI>When the welcome screen appears as the computer is restarting, press and
   continue to hold COMMAND+OPTION.

<P><LI>When you are prompted to rebuild the desktop file, release the keys and
   click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the Microsoft Office Manager and the first
run installation process.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The first run installation process is started the first time you start
any Office 98 program after you perform a drag-and-drop installation of
Office 98. This process usually runs only once. However, if certain
critical files are missing from the System Folder:Extensions folder on the
computer, the first run installation process automatically runs when you
start an Office 98 program.
