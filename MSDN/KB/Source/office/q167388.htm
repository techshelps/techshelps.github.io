The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Access 97
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the AutoCorrect feature in any of the programs listed at the
beginning of this article on a computer that is shared by multiple users,
the AutoCorrect list on the computer may contain entries created by other
users who also use the same computer.
<P>
In addition, multiple users may share the same AutoCorrect list file
(&lt;User name&gt;.acl).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You use a Microsoft Office 97 program on a computer that is running
   Microsoft Windows 95 with user profiles.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>Each person who uses the computer does not log on to the computer at
   least one time before starting any of the Office 97 programs.
<P>
</UL>For an example of this behavior, see the “More Information” section in this
article.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, make sure that each user logs on to the
computer at least once before running any of the Microsoft Office 97
programs for the first time. When each user logs on, Windows 95 creates the
proper entries for that user in the registry. This step prevents a new user
from inheriting the registry entries of an existing user and allows each
person who logs on to the computer to use an individual AutoCorrect list
file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 creates a user profile when a user logs on to a computer for the
first time. When the profile is created, the corresponding registry keys
for that user are also created. One of the registry keys that Windows 95
creates controls which AutoCorrect list is used by each user.
<P>
The behavior described in this article occurs if a new user logs on to the
computer after any of the Microsoft Office 97 programs are run. When this
occurs, the new user inherits the registry entries of another user, and
both users share a common AutoCorrect list file.
<P>
For example, assume you are using a computer running Windows 95 with user
profiles, and the computer is shared by the following four users:
<P>
<PRE>   Andrew
   Barbara
   Carly
   Dexter

</PRE>Prior to installing Microsoft Office 97, only Andrew logged on to the
computer. If Andrew logs on to the computer and starts any of the Microsoft
Office 97 programs, the other users (Barbara, Carly, and Dexter) will use
Andrew's AutoCorrect list file when they log on to the computer and run a
Microsoft Office 97 program.
<P>
If Barbara logs on to the computer before any of the Microsoft Office 97
programs are started, she will use her own AutoCorrect list file.
