The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Simple Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI), version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When viewing a message in the Netscape Navigator mail client, one or more
of the following may be true:

<UL><LI>Attachments were added to the message when it was sent, but the message
   does not appear as if it has attachments; the attachments come through
   as only text within the message.

<LI>No attachments were added to the message before sending, but an
   attachment that seems to contain message header information appears on
   the message.
<P>
</UL>However, when the same message is viewed in the Microsoft Windows Messaging
client, Microsoft Exchange, or Microsoft Outlook, it appears as desired.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The message is being sent to a one-off address, and MAPIResolveName was not
called. (One-off addresses are used to send messages to recipients that do
not have a corresponding entry in any of the session's address book
containers.)
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Before sending the message, call MAPIResolveName to force the one-off
address to be resolved by MAPI.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can specify addresses that are not in the address book with the
following format:
<P>
<PRE>   Display name[Address type:E-mail address]

</PRE>There are six components to this format:

<OL><P><LI>Display name (Optional) -- If not present, MAPIResolveName uses the
   visible part of the e-mail address as the display name. May include
   blanks.

<P><LI>[ (Required) -- Delineates the start of the type and address
   information.

<P><LI>] (Required) -- Delineates the end of the type and address information.
   If anything other than white space follows this character, the entry is
   not treated as a custom recipient.

<P><LI>Address type (Required) -- Type of address; maps to a specific address
   format (such as SMTP or FAX).

<P><LI>: (Required) -- Separates the address type from the e-mail address.

<P><LI>E-mail address (Required) -- Address of the recipient. May include
   blanks.
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information on One-Off Addresses, see the topic in the Platform
SDK under Win32 Messaging.
