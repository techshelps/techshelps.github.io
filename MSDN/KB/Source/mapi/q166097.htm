The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Extended Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI), version
</UL>1.0, included with Microsoft Windows Messaging
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
E-mail addresses in MAPI are defined by two properties. The address type,
PR_ADDRTYPE, is a string property that names the messaging system the
address is destined for. It is used by MAPI to assign responsibility for an
e-mail address to the right transport provider. The e-mail address itself,
PR_EMAIL_ADDRESS, is another string whose format varies depending upon
PR_ADDRTYPE. It is not interpreted by MAPI, but by the transport provider
and by the messaging system itself.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This appendix lists address types known to MAPI and the corresponding e-
mail address formats. Several of these address types, including SMTP, X400,
and FAX are used by a large number of messaging systems. It is important
that all MAPI components agree on the type name and address format for such
common types, so they can interoperate smoothly. MAPI address book
providers, MAPI transport providers, and gateways to messaging systems with
MAPI-based clients should all take note of this specification.
<P>
To define a new address type, to make comments or suggestions about the
information in this appendix, or to request more information, send e-mail
to mapi@microsoft.com. The following table, and many of the address type
specifications that follow, are work in progress.

</PRE>In most cases address types are invisible to the user. However, when trying
to send a message to a recipient that does not appear in an address book,
the address type must be known or the message will not be delivered. The
address type is used by MAPIResolveName to help create a temporary
recipient with the appropriate credentials. Once MAPIResolveName
accomplishes this, the message can be handed off to the appropriate
transport for delivery to the intended recipient.
