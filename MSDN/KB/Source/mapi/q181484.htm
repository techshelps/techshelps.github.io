<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to specify contexts and events that client
extensions should work with within the Exchange or Outlook clients.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Exchange or Outlook clients must be aware of the extension. In order to
make the Exchange or Outlook clients aware of an extension, the extension
must have an entry in the system registry. This entry must appear in the
following subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Extensions

</PRE>A sample entry looks like this (NOTE: The text should be on one line):
<P>
<PRE>   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Extensions\]
    @=" " "Extension Name"="4.0;c:\\dirname\\extension name.dll;1"

</PRE>The above text (if placed on one line) can be copied to a text file and
saved with the extension .reg. This .reg file can then be used to register
the extension. The effect this entry will have is that this extension will
be called on all events that occur within the Exchange or Outlook clients.
We can see this by the lack of context or interface mappings in this entry.
Since none are specified, all events and contexts are used. For a complete
breakdown of the context and interface mappings please see "Registering
Extensions" in the Microsoft Platform Software Development Kit.
<P>
Some extensions may only need to run under certain contexts or in response
to certain, but not all events. Events are matched with certain interfaces
that the extension supports. For example, if an extension supports the
IExchExtMessageEvents interface, the client needs to be aware of this. You
specify this by turning on the 4th bit in the Interface Map section of the
extension entry in the registry. A sample entry looks like this (NOTE: The
text should be on one line):
<P>
<PRE>   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Extensions\
    @=" " "Extension Name"=
    "4.0;c:\\dirname\\extension name.dll;1;00000000000000;0001000"

</PRE>This entry would indicate that the extension will be invoked under no
contexts, and only in events that are associated with the
IExchangeExtMessageEvents interface. Because this is the only interface or
context the extension maps to, it will only be executed when an event
associated with this interface occurs. The extension may or may not support
all the methods in this interface. We can be assured that the methods that
are implemented by the extension will be executed by the client when these
events occur.
