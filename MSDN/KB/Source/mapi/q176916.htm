The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Collaboration Data Objects (CDO), versions 1.0a, 1.1, 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has released several different object models that provide
Messaging functionality. These object libraries are OLE Messaging, Active
Messaging, and Collaboration Data Objects (CDO). This article briefly
describes each object library and how they relate to each other.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
OLE Messaging, Active Messaging, and CDO are first, second, and third
generation (respectively) of Microsoft's Messaging object library.
<P>
<P><h3>OLE Messaging</h3>
 
<P>
OLE Messaging is installed with the Exchange 4.0 client and server and
Windows Messaging System (WMS). OLE Messaging is an out-of-process OLE
server called Mdisp[32].exe which is available in both 16-bit and 32-bit
builds. OLE Messaging is now called CDO 1.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Active Messaging</h3>
 
<P>
Active Messaging is installed with the Exchange 5.0 client and server.
Active Messaging is an in-process OLE server called Olemsg[32].dll, which
is available in both 16-bit and 32-bit builds. There were a few feature
enhancements in Active Messaging, but the core functionality of the library
remains mostly unaltered. Active Messaging is now called CDO 1.1.
<P>
CDO 1.1 is available for free download from the Microsoft website as
documented in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Where to Acquire the Active Messaging Library

</PRE><h3>Collaboration Data Objects (CDO)</h3>
 
<P>
CDO version 1.2 is installed with Exchange Server 5.5. The object library
consists of the in-process OLE servers called Cdo.dll.
<P>
CDO is Microsoft's first Messaging offering specifically targeted at
satisfying the increasing developer community request for more richly
featured inter-application collaboration. Some of the added functionality
over CDO 1.1 includes support for scheduling meetings and appointments.
More detailed information on the feature set of CDO 1.2 can be found in the
CDO online documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Collaboration Data Objects for NTS (CDONTS)</h3>
 
<P>
CDONTS is a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) specific OLE server that
is specifically designed to provide Messaging functionality to Web-based
applications. The object library consists of the in-process OLE server
called Cdonts.dll. For more information on CDONTS, please see the product
documentation.
