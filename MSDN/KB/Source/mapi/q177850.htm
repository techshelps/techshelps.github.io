The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Collaboration Data Objects (CDO), version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) allows developers to build collaborative
applications. Currently, there are two versions of CDO. CDO version 1.2 for
Exchange and CDO version 1.2 for Microsoft Windows NT Server (NTS). This
document describes each library and helps the developer determine which is
best suited to their objective.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>CDO version 1.2 for Exchange</h3>
 
<P>
CDO version 1.2 for Exchange,  replaces Active Messaging 1.1. CDO 1.2 is
currently installed when you install Exchange 5.5 server or the Outlook Web
Access component found on the Exchange 5.5 server CD. Outlook version 8.03
continues to install Active Messaging 1.1.
<P>
NOTE: If you install Exchange 5.5 or Outlook Web Access and then install
Outlook 8.03, CDO 1.2 will be replaced with Active Messaging 1.1. See below
under "Registering CDO 1.2" for more information.
<P>
CDO for Exchange is based on MAPI and allows you to develop rich
applications based on Exchange data. CDO for Exchange contains two rich
components, CDO and CDO Rendering. CDO allows you to manipulate Exchange
data and to send and receive messages while CDO Rendering allows you to
render Exchange data into HTML. Outlook Web Access is an excellent example
of an application that takes advantage of both feature sets of CDO and is
available on the Exchange server CD. Outlook Web Access allows users to
view their Exchange Inbox and other folders from a Web browser.
<P>
CDO for Exchange allows developers to build rich collaborative applications
using Exchange-only features. Developers must specify or build a MAPI
profile for a user to logon. This allows the user to be fully authenticated
and increases the overall security. When using Active Server Pages (ASP),
Internet Information Server (IIS) can impersonate the user allowing remote
users to view their Exchange server information. Other key features include
the ability to filter and sort messages, schedule meeting requests and add
appointments, and render messages and personal calendars into HTML.
<P>
Installing CDO 1.2 for Exchange on Client Computers
 
<P>
CDO version 1.2 is not installed by Outlook 8.03 because the library was
only tested to work with server computers. While the .dll file and
supporting files can be copied to a client computer and registered, this is
currently not a supported configuration. Microsoft is currently testing the
library for use on client computers.
<P>
<P><h3>CDO 1.2 for NTS</h3>
 
<P>
CDO version 1.2 for NTS, also known as CDO for NTS, is an SMTP-specific
lightweight version of CDO for Exchange. This version of CDO was designed
to allow server applications to send and receive messages without requiring
Exchange server. CDO for NTS is installed by the following three products:

<UL><LI>Exchange Server 5.5
<LI>Internet Information Server 4.0
<LI>MCIS
<P>
</UL>Applications written using CDO for NTS must run on the server computer.
Unlike CDO for Exchange, applications cannot be written to access remote
servers or to develop client applications. All of the configuration
information such as SMTP server is gathered from the host computer. This
configuration cannot be modified using the library. Since one of the three
programs is required to use CDO for NTS, there is no standalone setup
program.
<P>
CDO for NTS was designed to be lightweight and to take advantage of
Internet standards. To support the majority of Internet developers, a new
object is available with the CDO for NTS library, called NewMail. This
allows a developer to send messages using as little as four lines of code.
This also allows you to send rich messages using HTML and MHTML.
<P>
Applications that are developed using the CDO for NTS library on one
platform continue to work unmodified on the other platforms. For example,
applications developed using Internet Information Server (IIS) version 4.0
continue to work after upgrading to Exchange 5.5.
<P>
Applications can also be upgraded to CDO for Exchange, but some changes to
the application are required. The most notable change is the ProgId and the
logon information.
<P>
<P><h3>Comparison</h3>
 
<P>
Both libraries have key benefits and learning the differences between each
library helps you to determine which library to use.

</PRE>*Some modifications to Active Messaging applications may be required to

<P>
<P><h3>Recommended Usage</h3>
 
<P>
CDO for Exchange:

<UL><LI>Requires Authenticated user support
<LI>Rendering Exchange Data
<LI>Accessing personal calendar store
<LI>Accessing multiple remote Exchange servers
<LI>Accessing mail from remote sites
<LI>Server-based custom mail agents
<LI>Automatic load balancing of outgoing mail
<LI>Upgrading existing Active Messaging application
<LI>Developing client applications
<LI>Developing server applications
<LI>Filtering and Sorting messages
<LI>Support for multiple providers
<LI>Developing three tier Web-based mail applications
<P>
</UL>CDO for NTS:

<UL><LI>Requires HTML or MHTML Support
<LI>Heavy outgoing mail processing
<LI>Sending unauthenticated mail from Web sites
<LI>Server-based replication
<LI>Server mail-based notification
<LI>Server-based custom mail agents
<LI>Developing server applications
<P>
</UL><h3>Registering CDO 1.2</h3>
 
<P>
If Outlook 8.03 or previous is installed after CDO 1.2 is installed, CDO
will be replaced with Active Messaging. This can be corrected by re-
registering the Cdo.dll using the Regsvr32.exe program. Here's an example:

<OL><P><LI>Select Run from the Windows Start menu.

<P><LI>Enter the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      REGSVR32 CDO.DLL
</PRE><P>
   A dialog should appear indicating the .dll file has been registered
   successfully.
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
