<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, versions 4.21a and 6.0
</UL> 
Bug#: 10252 (6.00)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
During object resolution, Microsoft SQL Server version 6.0 may not
successfully resolve the dependency, which can cause a thread access
violation.
<P>
There are several variations of the behavior depending on whether you
are using a view or a stored procedure, and, more specifically, user
created objects. User created objects induce errors with stored procedure
resolution.
<P>
There are two basic situations. First, the table is created, a view
or stored procedure is created to reference the table, and then the table
is dropped.
<P>
The second situation is the same as the first, only the table is re-
created. In general, you would expect the first scenario always to error
because the object no longer exists, and the second to resolve the table
change.
<P>
However, the following chart lists the different scenarios that lead
to unsuccessful outcomes. The first scenario is referred to as NOTBL and
the second outcome is referred to as WITHTBL.
<P>
Table created by:  dbo
<PRE>View create by:    dbo
</PRE><h2>Test run by user:  dbo</h2>
 
<P>
NOTBL:
<P>
<PRE>   Version: 6.0
   The first dbo connection that attempts to execute the view receives
   error message(208):

       Invalid object name '%s'.

   The second dbo connection receives a thread access violation and the
   SQL Server hangs, meaning no new connections are accepted by the SQL
   Server until it is stopped and restarted.

   Version: 4.21a
   Continues to receive error message (208):

      Invalid object name '%s'

   and 4413 error messages.

View create by:     dbo

</PRE>WITHTBL:
<PRE>   Version: 6.0
   The first dbo connection that attempts to execute the view receives
   error message (208):

      Invalid object name '%s'.

   The second dbo connection receives a thread access violation and the
   SQL Server hangs, meaning no new connections are accepted by the SQL
   Server until it is stopped and restarted.

   Version: 4.21a
   Successful resolution

Table created by:    test_user
</PRE>Procedure create by: test_user
<PRE>Test run by user:    dbo
</PRE> 
<P>
WITHTBL:
<PRE>   Version: 6.0
   Continues to generate error message (208):

      Invalid object name '%s'.

   and never resolves the dependency.

   Version: 4.21a
   Successful resolution


</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Drop and recreate the object(s) which rely on the missing or changed
dependency object.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
versions 4.21a and 6.0. This problem was corrected in Service Pack 1 for
SQL Server version 6.0. For more information, contact your primary support
provider.
