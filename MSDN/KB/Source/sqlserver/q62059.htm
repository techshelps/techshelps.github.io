<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information is a high-level description of general SQL
Server performance analysis.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>General Performance</h3>
 
<P>
On stand-alone systems, allocate all available physical memory to SQL
Server.
<P>
On non-stand-alone systems, subtract memory requirements of other
applications from available physical memory.
<P>
The percent of memory allocated to the procedure cache is
configurable.
<P>
The procedure cache needs to be higher during development than during
production.
<P>
Triggers, rules, and defaults also go in the procedure cache.
<P>
Performance can be improved by having devices on separate disks.
<P>
The log device should preferably be on a separate device.
<P>
If the recovery interval is too low, it can hurt performance and fill
the device.
<P>
If the recovery interval is too high, it causes periodic massive
slowdowns.
<P>
<P><h3>Time Slice</h3>
 
<P>
The time slice is configurable (the default is 100 milliseconds).
<P>
If the time slice is too low, it will slow down the system due to
overhead.
<P>
If the time slice is too high, it can cause long response times when
one process doesn't schedule out for a long time.
<P>
<P><h3>Stored Procedures</h3>
 
<P>
Stored procedures are faster than ad-hoc queries because they are
stored in the procedure cache. It is possible for stored procedures
to run slower than ad-hoc queries if the search value cannot be
determined until run time. This can happen as when using following
type of stored procedure creation:
<P>
<PRE>   create procedure how_fast @parm int as
   begin
   select x from y where z=@parm
   end

</PRE>In general, frequently used simple operations should be contained in
stored procedures.
<P>
<P><h3>Indexes</h3>
 
<P>
For a query to run fast on a large table, you must have an index on
the columns in the WHERE clause.
<P>
The query optimizer chooses the best-looking index, depending on the
following factors:
<P>
<PRE>   Clustered or nonclustered indexes
   Statistics
   Nonclustered index covering query
   Selectivity
   Size of table
   Uniqueness

</PRE>Clustered indexes are generally faster -- use them for most frequent
look ups, use nonclustered indexes for less frequent look ups.
<P>
Nonclustered indexes that use "cover query" are very fast, you can add
nonkey columns to nonclustered indexes to make specific queries run
faster.
<P>
The ORDER BY clause will not force a sort if the chosen index is
already in the right order.
<P>
Indexes must be updated when their tables are updated. When there are
a lot of indexes, the UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE commands can be very
slow.
<P>
<P><h3>Problem Analysis</h3>
 
<P>
The following is the approach to take if a query is running too slowly:

<UL><LI>You should first see whether useful looking indexes exist.

<LI>Be careful about views. If the query uses a view, the query can be
   a lot more complicated than it appears.

<LI>Be careful about triggers. It may be that the trigger is running
   slowly, not the user-submitted query itself.

<LI>If there are useful-looking indexes, see what indexes the optimizer
   is choosing. To do this, set "noexec" on, and also set "showplan"
   on.

<LI>If the optimizer is not choosing good indexes, make sure the
   statistics are up to date by using the UPDATE STATISTICS command.
