<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The system table sysindexes records the number of pages allocated and
used by each table, index, and text or image column in a database. The
system procedure sp_spaceused reports this information to users. This
article explains some of the data in sysindexes and how it is used by
sp_spaceused to calculate the values it reports.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Sysindexes will have 1 to 255 rows for each table in the database. All
rows for a given table will have the tables object id in their id
column. All sysindexes rows for a table can be found with the command:
<P>
<PRE>   SELECT *
   FROM sysindexes
   WHERE id = object_id('table_name')

</PRE>The sysindexes rows for a table fall into the following categories:
<P>
Every table without a clustered index has a row with name = table_name
and indid = 0. In this row:
<P>
<PRE>   dpages   = Number of data pages, excluding text and image columns.
   reserved = Number of pages reserved for dpages and ALL indexes.
   used     = Number of pages used for dpages and ALL indexes.
   rows     = Number of rows in the dpages.

</PRE>A table with a clustered index has no row with name = table_name.
There is instead a row with name = clustered_index_name and indid = 1.
In this row:
<P>
<PRE>   dpages   = Number of data pages, excluding text and image columns.
   reserved = Number of pages reserved for the dpages and ALL indexes.
   used     = Number of pages used for dpages and ALL indexes.
   rows     = Number of rows in the dpages.

</PRE>A table with at least one text or image column will have a row with
name = table_name prefixed with "t", and indid = 255. In this row:
<P>
<PRE>   reserved = Number of pages reserved for all text or image
              data in the table (all columns).
   used     = Number of pages used for all text or image
              data in the table (all columns).
   dpages and rows will be 0.

</PRE>Every nonclustered index has a row with name = index_name and indid
between 2 and 254. The values in these rows for dpages, reserved,
used, and rows are not used by sp_spaceused.
<P>
Note that the data returned by selects on sysindexes is in numbers of
pages. The number of pages is multiplied by the pagesize from
spt_values to get the number of bytes in the pages, then divided by
1024 to get the number of kilobytes, which is the value returned by
sp_spaceused. The pagesize in spt_values for SQL Server on OS/2 is
2048, so multiplying the values in the sysindexes columns by 2 gives
the numbers of kilobytes reported by sp_spaceused.
<P>
If the user enters sp_spaceused against a table (exec sp_spaceused
table_name) it will select only the sysindexes rows that relate to the
table by first setting @id = object_id('table_name') and then using
(id= @id) in the WHERE clause to restrict the selects to the table
named. If the user did not enter a table name, then sp_spaceused does
not restrict the selects with id = @id, so each SELECT returns rows
for all tables in the database. The SELECTs given here are in the form
that is used if a table name is specified. If sp_spaceused is issued
against the entire database, the selects are the same except that the
id = @id clause is not used.
<P>
The following selects show how sp_spaceused calculates the number of
pages in each space usage category it reports. sp_spaceused then
adjusts these numbers using the algorithm above to determine the
numbers of kilobytes it reports for each category.
<P>
#rows=
<P>
<PRE> SELECT rows
 FROM sysindexes
 WHERE indid &lt; 2 and id = @id


</PRE>#reserved=
<P>
<PRE> SELECT sum(reserved)
 FROM sysindexes
 WHERE indid in (0, 1, 255) and id = @id


</PRE>#data=
<P>
<PRE> (SELECT sum(dpages)               +    (SELECT sum(used)
  FROM sysindexes                        FROM sysindexes
  WHERE indid &lt; 2 and id = @id)          WHERE indid = 255 and id = @id)


</PRE>#index_size=
<P>
<PRE> (SELECT sum(used)
  FROM sysindexes
  WHERE indid in (0, 1, 255) and id = @id)     -     #data


</PRE>#unused=
<P>
<PRE> #reserved        -     (SELECT sum(used)
                         FROM sysindexes
                         WHERE indid in (0, 1, 255) and id = @id)

</PRE>NOTE: To reduce system overhead, sysindexes is not updated until a
checkpoint. If you need to get a current report, issue a checkpoint
command before issuing sp_spaceused or selecting from sysindexes.
