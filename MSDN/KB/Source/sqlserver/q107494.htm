<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft SQL Server ships with all the SQL components necessary to connect
from an MS-DOS, Windows, Windows for Workgroups, OS/2, or Windows NT client
running on a Novell network. You do not need to have a NetWare requester or
redirector on the SQL Server computer. The IPX/SPX client-side network
library will usually be used, although a Windows NT client can also connect
using the named pipes network library.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Instructions for Server-side Setup:
 

<OL><P><LI>Ensure the NWLink protocol is enabled according to the instructions in
   your Windows NT documentation. In brief, this consists of using the
   Windows NT Control Panel network applet to install and configure the
   Microsoft NWLink IPX/SPX transport protocol. This protocol by itself
   does not allow Windows NT to connect as a network client to a Novell
   file server. However, it does allow the Windows NT computer to function
   as a SQL application server on a Novell network.

<P><LI>Install SQL Server according to the instructions in the SQL Server
   Configuration Guide.

<P><LI>Either during or after server installation, use the SQL Server Setup
   program and select the Change Network Support option. If this
   option is greyed out, you may have the Desktop version of SQL Server,
   which does not support networked connections. Another possible
   cause of the Change Network Support option being greyed out is
   if you use full integrated security, which does not allow the use
   of IPC (Interprocess Communications) techniques other than named pipes.

<P><LI>In the Install/Uninstall Networks dialog, select the NWLink
   IPX/SPX checkbox. You do not need to use the Client Configuration
   Utility on SQL Server to select a different default network.
<P>
</OL>Instructions for Client-side Setup:
 

<OL><P><LI>For MS-DOS, Windows, and OS/2 clients, you must first ensure that the
   Novell client networking software is correctly installed according to
   Novell's instructions. Make sure you use the latest versions of
   Novell's client network software, which is usually available on
   their CompuServe forum or directly from Novell. Windows NT and
   Windows for Workgroups 3.11 clients do not require Novell networking
   software to connect as a SQL client to a SQL Server application server,
   but can use the built-in NWLink IPX/SPX compatible transport.

<P><LI>Install the SQL Server client setup disk for the client operating
   system you have. This will allow connection to SQL Server
   over IPX/SPX. There are separate client utilities setup disks for
   MS-DOS, Windows, and OS/2. NT clients use the SQL Server Setup
   disk #1. MS-DOS, Windows, Windows for Workgroups, and OS/2 clients
   using Novell networking software cannot use Novell's named pipes
   implementation to connect to SQL Server.

<P><LI>MS-DOS, Windows, and OS/2 clients use the SQL IPX/SPX network
   library on top of Novell's client networking software to connect to SQL
   Server. Windows for Workgroups 3.11 clients can connect to SQL Server
   via IPX/SPX in two different ways. One way is to use the built-in
   Windows for Workgroups "IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with NetBIOS"
   (often called NWLink), which you can select in the Windows Setup
   program. See your Windows for Workgroups documentation for more specific
   information. In this case, use the SQL Server Windows Client
   Utilities disk, run Setup, and select "named pipes" as your default
   network. You can also use the "default network" part of the SQL Client
   Configuration Utility to select the named pipes network library. Do not
   select "Novell IPX/SPX", as this uses the wrong network library.
   Selecting "named pipes" causes the named pipes network library to be
   used over the built-in IPX/SPX compatible transport. See also the SQL
   Server 4.21 readme file for more information. It is recommended that the
   named pipes network library be used, because features such as integrated
   security and adjustable packet size are available only with named pipes.

<P><LI>The other way to connect from a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 client to
   SQL Server via IPX/SPX is to use Novell's networking software and the
   Novell IPX protocol (IPXODI). You must obtain this from Novell, and
   install it according to your Windows for Workgroups documentation.
   Afterward, use the SQL Server Windows Client Utilities
   disk, run Setup, and select "Novell SPX" as your default network,
   which selects the IPX/SPX network library. You can also use the "default
   network" part of the SQL Client Configuration Utility to select
   the IPX/SPX network library. The IPX/SPX network library is used
   over Novell's IPX/SPX transport. See also the SQL Server version 4.21
<PRE>   'readme' file for more information.

</PRE><P><LI>From a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 client, you can use both the named
   pipes and IPX/SPX network libraries simultaneously to connect to
   different servers via these different IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
   techniques. This might be used if you want to connect to SQL Server via
   IPX/SPX using the recommended named pipes network library, while also
   communicating to a SQL Server for OS/2 running the NetWare Integration
   Kit (NIK) using the IPX/SPX network library. In this case, first ensure
   you have both the Novell IPX/SPX network software and the Microsoft
   IPX/SPX compatible transport functioning correctly according the your
   Windows for Workgroups 3.11 documentation. Then, install the SQL Server
   Windows Client Utilities as above, and use the "default network" part of
   the SQL Client Configuration Utility to select named pipes as the
   default network library. Then, click the "Advanced" button, and under
   "Server" type the name of your SQL Server to which you want to connect
   using the IPX/SPX network library. Under "DLL Name", enter "dbmsspx3",
   then press "Add/Change", then "OK". You cannot communicate using named
   pipes over either the Microsoft IPX/SPX transport or Novell's IPX/SPX
   transport to an OS/2 SQL Server running Novell's named pipes
   implementation.

<P><LI>MS-DOS clients must use the DBMSSPX.EXE terminate-and-stay-resident
   (TSR) program to connect to SQL Server. They cannot use the Novell
   DOSNP.EXE named pipes TSR or DBNMPIPE.EXE named pipes network library
   TSR. Run the Setup program for the DOS Client Utilities disk and
   follow the instructions.

<P><LI>Windows NT clients generally use named pipes over NWLink IPX/SPX,
   which is the default. First, ensure the NWLink protocol is enabled
   according to the instructions in your Windows NT documentation.
   To then install the SQL NT client utilities, use the SQL Server Setup
   disk #1, and select the "Install Utilities Only" option.

<P><LI>Attempt to connect from ISQL/W (Windows, Windows for Workgroups, and
   NT clients) or ISQL (MS-DOS and OS/2 clients). If you have a problem
   connecting with ISQL/W, try typing in the name of your SQL Server,
   rather than pressing the "List Servers" button.
<P>
</OL>Use of a IPX/SPX network library assumes the presence of a Novell NetWare
file server on the network. SQL Server uses the bindery services of
the file server to handle name resolution. This allows the clients to
reference SQL Server by name, without manually coding a network address as
is often done on TCP/IP networks.
<P>
However, it is possible to connect from a SQL client over IPX/SPX to
SQL Server when no Novell file server is present. This requires
manually entering the network node address of the SQL Server. Instructions
for this are on page 108 of the SQL Server "Configuration Guide."
<P>
In addition, if there are any routers on the network you may want
to make sure that they are not filtering SAPs (Service Advertising
Packets) 62723 (0xF503) or 38404 (Ox9604). These are the SAP types that
SQL Server uses to advertise itself on the network.
<P>
The above instructions are unchanged whether Windows NT or Windows NT
Advanced Server is used.
