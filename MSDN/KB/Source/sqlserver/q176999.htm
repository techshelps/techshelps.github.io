The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5
</UL> 
BUG #: 17490
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Executing a DELETE statement against a table that has an index defined
using a FILLFACTOR of 100 percent may cause the connection or the entire
server to stop responding.
<P>
If SQL Server has more than one processor available, the connection will
stop responding, but work can continue on other connections. A KILL command
will not terminate the SPID. The only way to clear the problem is to cycle
SQL Server.
<P>
If SQL Server has only one processor to work with, the entire server will
stop responding. To regain control of SQL Server, you need to cycle Windows
NT.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The connection is caught in an infinite loop.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, allow some free space on your index pages by
specifying a FILLFACTOR of less than 100 percent (such as using
FILLFACTOR=80). In addition to avoiding exposure to the above problem,
doing this allows SQL Server to process your DELETE statement more
efficiently.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SQL Server version 6.5. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The type of index involved makes no difference to this problem. That is, it
can happen with clustered, non-clustered, unique, and non-unique indexes.
<P>
So far, this problem has only been observed using SQL Server built with the
binary sort order (the code page makes no difference). The same tests on
SQL Server built with a dictionary sort order did not result in exposure to
this problem.
<P>
