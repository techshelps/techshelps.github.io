The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, versions 6.0 and 6.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains the steps to manually remove (uninstall) replication,
using stored procedures and Transact-SQL commands.
<P>
The information in this article may be useful in situations where you
suspect that some elements of replication have not been removed correctly,
and you want to manually remove those elements. If replication is not
removed correctly, the transaction log of a previously published database
may fill up because the log cannot be truncated. (See step 3 below for
details on how to diagnose this possibility.)
<P>
This article may also be useful if you need to create a script or
programmatic procedure to uninstall replication.
<P>
The following list is a summary of the steps necessary to manually remove
replication. Details for each step are provided in the "MORE INFORMATION"
section of this article.

<OL><P><LI>Drop all subscriptions.

<P><LI>Drop all articles and publications.

<P><LI>Clear the transaction log of any "undistributed" replicated
   transactions.

<P><LI>Remove the database's published and subscribed status.

<P><LI>Delete unneeded remote servers and remote logins.

<P><LI>Remove a server's publisher, subscriber, and distributor status.

<P><LI>Delete any remaining replication tasks.

<P><LI>Delete the .sch and .tmp files in the Repldata directory.

<P><LI>Drop the distribution database.

<P><LI>Reset the MSlast_job_info table.

<P><LI>Verify the replication registry entry.
<P>
</OL>You may find it easier to use SQL Enterprise Manager, when possible, to
uninstall replication, rather than using stored procedures and Transact-SQL
commands.
<P>
In SQL Server 6.5, you can use SQL Enterprise Manager to remove replication
by clicking Replication Configuration/Uninstall Publishing on the Server
menu. For more details, see "Uninstalling Replication" in Part 3 of the
What's New In SQL Server 6.5 book.
<P>
SQL Server 6.0 does not have a replication uninstall option, but you can do
the equivalent of steps 1 through 7 using SQL Enterprise Manager. For SQL
Server 6.0, you will still need to do steps 8 through 11 manually. For more
details, see "Stopping Replication" in Chapter 14 of the SQL Server 6.0
Administrator's Companion.
<P>
Note that you should not use the dump and load mechanism to transfer a
database with publications and subscriptions to a different server. (In
this case, a "different server" means a server other than the one on which
the database was originally published.) In many cases, the procedures in
this article will not be sufficient to remove replication from a database
that has been dumped from one server and loaded onto another server.
<P>
If you must move a published database to a different server, you should
consider using Transfer Manager or the bulk copy program (BCP). You can
safely use the dump and load mechanism to transfer a published database to
a different server only if you drop all subscriptions and all publications
in the published database before dumping the database.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Below are the steps to manually remove (uninstall) replication are
described in detail. See the SQL Server Books Online for more information
on the commands and stored procedures discussed below.
<P>
Step 1 - Drop All Subscriptions
 
<P>
You can run sp_helpsubscription in the published database to determine
whether or not there are any subscriptions.
<P>
Run the command below to drop all subscriptions to all publications within
a published database. This command must be run in each database that is
published and has subscriptions. Running this command also deletes the
distribution tasks associated with the subscriptions that are dropped.
<P>
<PRE>   sp_dropsubscription 'all', 'all', 'all'

</PRE></OL>Note that sp_dropsubscriptions will only work correctly if both of the
following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>There is a distribution database installed.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The publishing server has correct remote server information for all
   subscribing servers. Remote server information is defined automatically
   when you configure replication. You can verify the remote server
   information by running sp_helpserver.
<P>
</UL><h3>Step 2 - Drop All Articles and Publications</h3>
 
<P>
You can run sp_helppublication in the published database to determine
whether or not there are any publications.
<P>
You can run "select * from sysarticles" in the published database to
determine whether or not there are any articles.
<P>
Run the command below to drop all articles and subscriptions within a
published database. This command must be run in each database that is
published and has publications. Running this command will also delete the
synchronization task associated with the publications that are dropped.
<P>
<PRE>   sp_droppublication 'all'

</PRE>Step 3 - Clear the Transaction Log of Any "Undistributed" Replicated
<PRE>         Transactions
</PRE> 
<P>
You will not be able to truncate the transaction log as long as there are
any replicated transactions that have not been distributed. An
"undistributed" replicated transaction is a transaction that has been
marked for replication in the transaction log of the published database,
but has not been "distributed" by the log reader task.
<P>
You can see if there are any "undistributed" replicated transactions in a
published database by running the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   dbcc opentran(&lt;published_database_name&gt;) with tableresults

</PRE>If the database has at some point had replicated transactions, the above
command will return the oldest distributed row ID ("REPL_OLD_DIST_RID") and
the oldest non-distributed row ID ("REPL_OLD_NONDIST_RID"). If the database
has never had any replicated transactions and there are no open
transactions, the above command will return 0 rows.
<P>
If the above command does return the oldest distributed and oldest non-
distributed row IDs, and if these row IDs are not the same, you have one or
more undistributed replicated transactions in that database. If the row IDs
are the same, you do not have any undistributed replicated transactions in
the database. For more information, see the DBCC statement in the Transact-
SQL Reference book.
<P>
If you have undistributed replicated transactions, run the following
command to mark all replicated transactions as "distributed" so that you
can truncate the log:
<P>
<PRE>   sp_repldone 0, 0, null, 0, 0, 1

</PRE>The sp_repldone command must be run in each database that has undistributed
replicated transactions.
<P>
The sp_repldone command can only be run if the database is marked as
published. If necessary, you can temporarily mark a database as published
by running the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   sp_dboption &lt;database_name&gt;, pub, true

</PRE>After running sp_repldone, you can mark the database as not published by
running the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   sp_dboption &lt;database_name&gt;, pub, false

</PRE>You should contact your primary support provider if you continue to see
replicated transactions in the transaction log after completing the
procedures in this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 4 - Remove the Database's "Published" and "Subscribed" Status</h3>
 
<P>
Run sp_helpdb to verify which databases have a status of "published" or
"subscribed."
<P>
Run the following command to remove the "published" status from a database.
Running this command also deletes the log reader task for that database.
<P>
<PRE>   sp_dboption &lt;database_name&gt;, published, false

</PRE>Run the following command to remove the "subscribed" status from a
database:
<P>
<PRE>   sp_dboption &lt;database_name&gt;, subscribed, false

</PRE><h3>Step 5 - Delete Unneeded Remote Servers and Remote Logins</h3>
 
<P>
Replication automatically defines remote servers and remote logins when you
install replication. The remote servers and remote logins are necessary to
run remote procedure calls. You may delete the remote servers and remote
logins if they are not required for other SQL Server applications.
<P>
NOTE: You should not drop the local server.
<P>
The local server is the one that has server ID 0 when you run
sp_helpserver. For more information on remote servers and remote users, see
Chapter 10 in the SQL Server Administrator's Companion.
<P>
You can run "sp_helpserver" to see a list of remote servers. You can run
"sp_helpremotelogin" to see a list of the remote logins. Run the following
command to drop a remote login:
<P>
<PRE>   sp_droplogin remoteserver_name [, loginame [, remotename]]

</PRE>Run the following command to drop a remote server:
NOTE: Do not drop the local server. The local server has server ID 0.
<P>
<PRE>   sp_dropserver server_name [, droplogins]

</PRE><h3>Step 6 - Remove a Server's Publisher, Subscriber, and Distributor Status</h3>
 
<P>
Run sp_helpserver to verify the status of the servers. Then run the
following command to remove a server's publisher ("pub") status:
<P>
<PRE>   sp_serveroption &lt;server_name&gt;, pub, false

</PRE>Run the following command to remove a server's remote publisher ("dpub")
status:
<P>
<PRE>   sp_serveroption &lt;server_name&gt;, dpub, false

</PRE>Run the following command to remove a server's subscriber ("sub")
status:
<P>
<PRE>   sp_serveroption &lt;server_name&gt;, sub, false

</PRE>Run the following command to remove a server's distributor ("dist")
status:
<P>
<PRE>   sp_serveroption &lt;server_name&gt;, dist, false

</PRE><h3>Step 7 - Delete Any Remaining Replication Tasks</h3>
 
<P>
Open the Manage Scheduled Tasks window in SQL Enterprise Manager by
double-clicking the SQL Executive icon. Delete any tasks that have a type
of "Logreader," "Distribution," or "Sync." Also delete any replication
cleanup tasks. Cleanup tasks have a name in the following format:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;publisher_server_name&gt;_&lt;subscriber_server_name&gt;_cleanup.

</PRE><h3>Step 8 - Delete the .Sch and .Tmp files in the Repldata Directory</h3>
 
<P>
Delete the .sch (published table schema script) and .tmp (synchronization
data) files in the MSSQL\Repldata directory on the distribution server.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 9 - Drop the Distribution Database</h3>
 
<P>
Run the following command to drop the distribution database:
<P>
<PRE>   drop database distribution

</PRE><h3>Step 10 - Reset the MSlast_job_info Table</h3>
 
<P>
The MSlast_job_info table exists in each subscribing database and keeps
track of the last job that was replicated to that database from each
publishing database. The MSlast_job_info table is created by the
distribution task after you subscribe to a publication.
<P>
If a subscribing database is not currently subscribed to any publishing
databases, you can simply use the following command to drop the
MSlast_job_info table in each subscribing database:
<P>
<PRE>   drop table MSlast_job_info

</PRE>If the subscribing database is still subscribed to one or more publishing
databases, you should use the following command to delete the rows in the
MSlast_job_info table that correspond to the database(s) to which it is no
longer subscribed:
<P>
<PRE>   delete MSlast_job_info
   where publisher = '&lt;publishing_server_name&gt;'
   and publisher_db = '&lt;publishing_database_name&gt;'

</PRE><h3>Step 11 - Verify the Replication Registry Entry</h3>
 
<P>
Before you can reinstall replication, the "DistributionDB" value under the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\Repliction registry key
must have a null string.
<P>
You can run the following command from the Master database to make the
string null:
<P>
<PRE>   xp_regwrite 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE',
   'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\Replication', 'DistributionDB',
   'REG_SZ', ''

</PRE>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall SQL Server. Microsoft cannot guarantee
that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
It is also possible to change this entry with Registry Editor (Regedt32 in
Windows NT 3.50 and Windows NT 3.51, or Regedit in Windows NT 4.0 and
Windows 95). If you do use the Registry Editor, do not delete the
"DistributionDB" entry itself; rather, double-click the DistributionDB
entry and delete the string in the Edit dialog box.
