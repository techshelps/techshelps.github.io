<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a workstation client application has problems connecting to SQL
Server, the question first asked is, "How do I determine if this is a
problem with my network software, or if this is a problem with SQL
Server?" The following instructions explain how to test the network
and local named pipes to help isolate network software problems.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Testing Network Named Pipes</h3>
 
<P>
There are two utilities shipped with SQL Server designed to help test
network named pipes. The MAKEPIPE.EXE utility is installed during
setup of the SQL Server server software. The READPIPE.EXE utility is
installed during setup of both DOS and OS/2 workstations.
<P>
Used together, these utilities test the integrity of the network named
pipe services.  To use these utilities, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Go to the SQL Server database server, and type makepipe at an OS/2
   command-line prompt. The Makepipe program will return:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Making PIPE:\pipe\abc
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      read to write delay (seconds):0
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Waiting for Client to Connect...
</PRE>
<P><LI>Go to the DOS or OS/2 workstation and type
<P>
<P><PRE>      readpipe /Sservername /Dstring
</PRE><P>
   where servername is the network name of the SQL Server on which
   Makepipe was just run, and string is a test character string. This
   string must be enclosed in quotation marks if it contains spaces.
   Note that there are no spaces between /S and the server name, and
   no spaces between /D and the string. For example, to connect to a
   SQL Server named "data", type either of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      readpipe /Sdata /Dhello
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      readpipe /Sdata /D"hello there"
</PRE>
<P><LI>If a network named pipe connection can be established, the
   workstation returns
<P>
<P><PRE>      SvrName:\\data
<PRE></PRE>      PIPE   :\\data\pipe\abc
      DATA   :hello

      Data Sent: 1 : hello
      Data Read: 1 : hello

   and the SQL Server returns:

      Waiting for client to send... 1

      Data Read:
      hello

      Waiting for client to send... 2

      Pipe closed

      Waiting for Client to Connect...

</PRE></OL>The server is now waiting for another client to connect, and the
Readpipe program can be run from other workstations. When all testing
is complete, go to the screen where the Makepipe program is still
running and press CTRL+BREAK or CTRL+C to halt execution.
<P>
If the results are different from step 3 above, the network named pipe
services are not secure. Clients will not be able to connect to SQL
Server until named pipes are available. In addition, these utilities
merely attempt to open and use a named pipe. They do not stress this
named pipe connection. Thus, although these tests may succeed, the
network connection may break under a heavy load.
<P>
<P><h3>Testing Local Named Pipes</h3>
 
<P>
One last test is to connect to the SQL Server on the OS/2 server
machine using local OS/2 pipes. This can be done by using a null (or
blank) server name. For example, the following will make a local ISQL
connection to the SQL Server when run at an OS/2 command-line prompt
on the database server machine:
<P>
<PRE>   isql /S /Ulogin /Ppassword

</PRE>To make a local connection using SAF, leave the Server Names field
blank (filled with dots) in the Login To SQL Server dialog box.
