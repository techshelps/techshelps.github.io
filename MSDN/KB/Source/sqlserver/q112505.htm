The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 4.2
</UL> 
BUG# NT: 9884 (4.2)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a trusted domain user is deleted from the trusted domain and it is a
member of a local group in the trusting domain that has access to SQL
Server for Windows NT, the entry for it displayed in the Security Manager
is not fully removed. The user name itself is removed but the domain name
and separator are not. This happens under mixed or integrated security
modes.
<P>
For example, two domains A and B (where domain A trusts domain B). In a
local group called SQLUsers that has been granted access to the SQL server
on domain A, there is a user 'test' from domain B. In the Security Manager,
the entry for this user within the group SQLUsers appears as: 'B\test'.
However, if the user 'test' is removed from domain B then the corresponding
entry in the Security Manager will appear as 'B\'.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
After the user id has been deleted, view the local group that it used to be
a member of on the trusting domain through the User Manager for Domains. At
this point, the list of group members will be refreshed and the entry will
no longer appear when the Security Manager is used.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
version 4.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
