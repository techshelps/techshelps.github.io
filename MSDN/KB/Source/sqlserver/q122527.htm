The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, versions 4.2x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you encounter difficulties with SQL Monitor scheduled tape events, it
is frequently helpful to review the MSscheduled_backups table to quickly
review the events that are scheduled. This article discusses the fields
that directly affect what is dumped, and when and where it is to be dumped.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The MSscheduled_backups table has the following structure for SQL Server
versions 4.21 and 4.21a. Starting with SQL 4.2, the 'stat' field was added,
and in 4.21 both the 'attempts' and 'email_name' fields were added.
<P>
NOTE: SQL Server version 4.2b for OS/2 does not contain these additional
fields.
<P>
<PRE>   Event_id        int                  4     NOT NULL
   Database_name   varchar             30     NOT NULL
   Database_owner  varchar             30     NOT NULL
   Database_dump   varchar             30     NULL
   Log_dump        varchar             30     NULL
   Day             tinyint              1     NOT NULL
   Frequency       tinyint              1     NOT NULL
   Start_time      char                 5     NOT NULL
   Enabled         bit                  1     NOT NULL
   Last_dump       datetime             8     NULL
   In_progress     bit                  1     NOT NULL
   Stat            tinyint              1     NULL
   attempts        tinyint              1     NULL
   email_name      varchar             60     NULL

</PRE>The combination of entries in the database_dump, log_dump, and stat fields
determine what type of activity will be accomplished by a particular event.
<P>
The following chart represents the relationships:
<P>
<PRE>   Activity                         Database_dump   log_dump   stat
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Dump Database to disk               Device         NULL       0
   Dump LOG to disk                    NULL           Device     0
   Dump Database with INIT             Device         NULL       0
   Dump LOG with INIT                  NULL           Device     0
   Dump both DB &amp; LOG with INIT        Device         Device     0
   Dump Database with APPEND           Device         NULL       2
   Dump DB with INIT, APPEND LOG       Device         Device     3
   Dump both DB &amp; LOG with APPEND      Device         Device     4
   Dump Trans with truncate_only       NULL           NULL       5
   Dump Trans with no_log              NULL           NULL       6

</PRE>The append and init are only appropriate for tape related events; if disk
dumps are involved, the stat field is zero. The only way to verify that a
dump with a stat of zero is to a tape rather than to disk is by comparing
the logical name listed in the MSscheduled_backups table for the
database_dump and log_dump with the logical name in sysdevices, where the
control type is five.
<P>
The start_time, day, and frequency fields will determine when the scheduled
event actually occurs. The time is entered using a twelve-hour clock in SQL
Administrator but is converted to the 24-hour clock, and it is entered in
the start_time field. The day is the day of the week, and the values start
with Sunday with a value of one. Daily dumps will have a day value of zero
with a frequency value of one.
<P>
The additional frequency values are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Dump              Frequency      Day
</PRE> 
<PRE>   Daily                1           day = 0
   Weekly               7           day in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
   Bi-Weekly           14           day in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
   Monthly Week 1      31           day in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
   Monthly Week 2      32           day in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
   Monthly Week 3      33           day in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
   Monthly Week 4      34           day in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}

</PRE>The attempts field was added in SQL Server version 4.21 and corresponds to
the SQLMonitor registry entry BackupRetryAttempts. By default, SQL Monitor
will attempt to dump a database three times, with each attempt being
documented in this field. This retry activity can be manipulated by making
the appropriate changes in the Windows NT registry.
