<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2
  - Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2
</PRE>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Every time SQL Server is started, the error log shows that one transaction
was rolled forward in certain databases. This happens even if the SHUTDOWN
command is used, which according to the documentation, performs a
CHECKPOINT; therefore, the result are no transactions needing to be rolled
forward when SQL Server starts up.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The documentation correctly states that if the SHUTDOWN command is issued
to stop SQL Server, or if a CHECKPOINT is issued prior to stopping SQL
Server, no transactions will need to be rolled forward on the next startup.
<P>
The likely cause of always having one transaction being rolled forward
every time SQL Server is started is having a database that has the "trunc.
log on chkpt." database option enabled. If this option is set on, the
transaction log for that database will be truncated each time the
checkpoint checking process issues a CHECKPOINT; in essence, it
automatically performs a DUMP TRANSACTION WITH TRUNCATE_ONLY for that
database.
<P>
Because a SHUTDOWN performs a CHECKPOINT prior to stopping SQL Server, it
also truncates the log at that time. Since a CHECKPOINT keeps track of all
uncommitted transactions, the CHECKPOINT record in the log shows the dump
process from the truncation of the log as being an open transaction at the
time the CHECKPOINT was issued.
<P>
When SQL Server is restarted, it scans the transaction log of each
database, rolling back any uncommitted transactions, and rolling forward
those that had completed but not written to disk during the last
CHECKPOINT. For the CHECKPOINT record that shows the dump process as being
open, SQL Server rolls forward that transaction to show that it had
completed.
