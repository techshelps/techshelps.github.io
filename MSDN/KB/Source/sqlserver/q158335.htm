The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 6.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An undetected deadlock can occur between a database dump and a user process
that holds locks on syscolumns. When this deadlock occurs, all activity
within the database is suspended until the deadlock is manually resolved.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a dump is initiated, the server acquires an exclusive table lock on
syslogs to enable it to coordinate user activity with the database dump
process. Once this lock is established, the server locks and dumps
sysobjects, and then locks and dumps syscolumns. The database dump process
then dumps all allocated pages within the database, and deals with any
logged user activity through its out-of-sequence queue.
<P>
However, when a dump is initiated, it is possible for a user to
simultaneously acquire a lock on syscolumns. If the release of this lock is
dependent on a logged update, the process will wait for its transaction to
be appended to syslogs.
<P>
Because the dump process has syslogs exclusively locked, the user process
will wait for its request to update syslogs before releasing its lock on
syscolumns. The dump process will then attempt to lock syscolumns, and will
wait on the user process to release its lock.
<P>
This results in an undetected deadlock: sp_who will show the user process
sleeping and the database dump blocked on the sleeping process.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Killing either the user process or the database dump process will resolve
the deadlock and allow activity within the database to continue.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
version 6.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
