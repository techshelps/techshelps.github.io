The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, versions 6.0 and 6.5
</UL> 
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry  Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Improper registry permissions may cause problems with your SQL Server
installation. For example, you may encounter the following problems:

<UL><LI>During the last portion of the setup process, Setup reports that the
   registry could not be updated.

<LI>You are unable to start SQL server in Integrated or Mixed Security mode.

<LI>You start SQL Server Setup, and at the Options screen select Change
   Network Support. When you click Continue, you receive the following
   error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The network could not be successfully installed. An error occurred
      while reading the Windows NT registry.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems can be caused by improper registry permissions. For example,
in the case of the first symptom listed above, SQL Server Setup attempts to
update the registry and create the program icons during the end of setup.
If the registry is configured so that the Windows NT account that is
running the upgrade does not have adequate permission to change the SQL
registry keys at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer and
its subkeys, Setup will display the error and quit. In the case of the
second and third symptoms above, the inability to read the RPCNetLib
registry key is the root cause of the problem.
<P>
The following are several reasons why the registry may have additional
security:

<UL><LI>C2 security was applied to the server.

<LI>Administrators are attempting to "lock down" the server.

<LI>Integrated security is in use (that is, the Windows NT account used to
   perform the upgrade is NOT a member of the admin group(s)).
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do the following:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

<OL><P><LI>Run RegEdt32 to open the registry, and navigate to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer
</PRE><P>
   You may find that the inner MSSQLServer key is unavailable.

<P><LI>On the Security menu, click Permissions.

<P><LI>Confirm that the Administrators and whoever else is appropriate are
   listed with Full Control permission.

<P><LI>Click to place a check in the Replace Permission On Existing Subkeys
   check box, and then click OK.
<P>
   The inner MSSQLServer key should now be available. You can also access
   the keys under MSSQLServer\MSSQLServer, such as Parameters,
   CurrentVersion, and RPCNetLib.

<P><LI>Start SQL Server Setup.

<P><LI>Confirm that you can now enter the Change Network Support area, and
   confirm the desired network libraries are selected (either Named Pipes
   or Multi-Protocol for Integrated or Mixed security).

<P><LI>Check Set Security Options and confirm that Mixed or Integrated is now
   selected.

<P><LI>Stop and restart the server.

<P><LI>Confirm that the server is running in the desired mode. Use ISQL\W to
   make a trusted connection.
<P>
</OL>Alternatively, if your problem lies in running SQL Server Setup to perform
an upgrade, you can also use a Windows NT account that already has the
proper permissions to compete the upgrade. To do this, perform the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>From a command prompt at the &lt;SQL_root&gt;\Binn directory, run the
   following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      setup /t RegistryRebuild = On
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The RegistryRebuild command above must be typed exactly as shown,
   including capitalization. A space on either side of the equal sign (=)
   is required.
<P>
   You should be prompted for all information regarding the SQL Server
   installation, starting with the Enter Name And Organization dialog box.
   Running this command also creates the registry entries and the Program
   Manager icons.

<P><LI>Ensure that SQL Server and SQL Executive start properly. If SQL Server
   was starting under a Windows NT account (as opposed to the local system)
   you need to run Control Panel Services and modify the Startup options
   for MSSQLServer to Log On As the specified Windows NT account.
