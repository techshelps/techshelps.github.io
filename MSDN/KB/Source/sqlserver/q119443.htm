<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server version 4.21
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
One of the supported features of Microsoft SQL Server is the ability to
dump databases to disk devices defined on shared network resources. This
article explores the additional options available to the Database
Administrator in defining database dump devices located on Novell File
Servers. This capability takes advantage of the Client and Gateway Services
for NetWare available from Microsoft.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Defining Database Dump Devices with Microsoft SQL Server on the Windows NT
Advanced Server or Windows NT Workstation without setting up a Gateway
Share is simple and does not require special mapping on the Novell File
Server nor does it require that there be a shared device defined in File
Manager.
<P>
For this example, Windows NT will represent either an Advanced Server or a
Workstation. It is important to note that the Client (Workstation) and
Gateway (Advanced Server) Services for NetWare be appropriately setup so
that files can be copied from the Novell File Server to Windows NT without
error. Routing and frame type issues must be resolved prior to implementing
this procedure.
<P>
The initial requirement for this setup is that a NTGATEWAY group on the
Novell File Server exists. The first method depends on GUEST validation by
the Novell File Server.
<P>
The Windows NT setup begins with setting up the SQL Server Service to
startup with a login of LocalSystem. This is done via the Control Panel,
Services icon (Consult the Microsoft Windows NT or the Microsoft Windows NT
Advanced Server System Guide). When SQL Server starts up, it will login as
a LocalSystem account on Windows NT, which means that the Novell File
Server has no knowledge of this Windows NT user id.
<P>
On the Novell File Server the GUEST account must be added to the NTGATEWAY
Group and must have complete Trustee rights to the directory where the SQL
Server database dump will be written. When SQL Server attempts to dump the
database to this directory, Novell will validate the login and use the
GUEST account with NTGATEWAY as the user group.
<P>
The second method is to start the SQL Server Service with a login account
that is valid on the Novell File Server and on Windows NT. This USER must
have appropriate access to stop and start Windows NT Services. The USER
id/password on Windows NT must match exactly with the USER id/password on
the Novell File Server. In addition, the USER must also be a member of the
NTGATEWAY Group and have complete Trustee rights to the directory where the
SQL Server database dump will be written.
<P>
Setting up the Microsoft SQL Server database dump device is covered in the
"Microsoft SQL Server Administrator's Guide" on pages 23-30. However,
unlike setting up a local disk dump device, the Universal Naming Convention
(UNC) must be used to specify the File Server, Volume, Directory, and File.
<P>
For example, to define a database dump device on the Novell File Server
WHISTLE/SYS:USERS/TEST the following would be entered as the physical file
name:
<P>
<PRE>   Logical Name: pubsdump
   Physical Name: \\WHISTLE\SYS\USERS\TEST\pubs.dmp

</PRE>(The use of UNC naming convention is covered in the "Microsoft Client and
Gateway Services for NetWare Users Guide.")
<P>
Once the dump device has been defined. Verify that the process works by
performing a dump database with a valid SQL Server login Id.
