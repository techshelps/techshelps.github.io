<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To inform Microsoft SQL Server for OS/2 that you have added new memory to
a system, use SQL Administrator and select SYSTEM/Manage/Configure SQL
Server. Make note of the amount of memory (given in 2K pages, 512 pages = 1
MB) that is currently available to Microsoft SQL Server for OS/2 and
add to that number approximately 80 percent of the new memory you are
adding to the system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can experiment with increasing the memory reserved for Microsoft SQL
Server for OS/2 but be very careful. Configuring the memory incorrectly
may cause SQL Server to be unable to start or to start very slowly.
<P>
If Microsoft SQL Server for OS/2 fails to start, use the bldmstr program
to reset the configuration values to what they were at install time. You
can use the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   bldmastr /r /C /d\sql\data\master.dat

</PRE>The /C switch must be in uppercase letters, and is only necessary if
the SQL Server was originally installed as case insensitive, otherwise do
not use /C. Note that this command will reset all other configuration
parameters to their defaults as well. Any  modifications you had made to
the SQL Server configuration prior to running bldmastr will be lost and
will have to be reapplied.
<P>
Keep in mind that OS/2 versions 1.3 and earlier can access only 16 MB of
memory. On some machines, however, such as Paralan and Citrix computers,
parts of OS/2 version 1.3 have been rewritten so that more then 16 MB can
be accessed.
