<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 6.0
</UL> 
BUG# NT: 12529 (6.00)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the SQL Server 6.0 BCP utility to copy in files larger than
approximately 1.8 GB in size, it can fail with the error:
<P>
<PRE>   BCP copy in failed.

</PRE>The error appears almost immediately.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The version 6.0 BCP utility uses the Win32 file mapping APIs for improved
performance. At the boundary where BCP switches from file mapping to
regular disk I/O, (approximately 1.8 GB) the switchover does not happen
successfully, which in turn causes this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You can split the input file into several files no larger than about 1.5
GB. Alternatively, the SQL Server version 4.2 BCP utility and corresponding
DB-Library file NTWDBLIB.DLL can be used instead. This works correctly
against a version 4.2 server or a version 6.0 server as long as only
version 4.2 datatypes are used. It is possible to run the 4.2 BCP utility
and 4.2 DB-Library on a version 6.0 server computer, because Windows NT
resolves DLLs based on path. This makes it possible to have multiple
versions of a given DLL in use concurrently, as long as they have different
disk paths. In this case, you would place version the 4.2 files BCP.EXE and
NTWDBLIB.DLL in a separate directory, and execute the utility from that
directory. SQL Server itself and other DB-Library programs running on the
server computer besides BCP could continue using the version 6.0 DB-
Library.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server 6.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
