The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, versions 6.0 and 6.5
</UL> 
BUG #: 16037 (Windows NT, 6.50)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a stored procedure is selected as the victim in a deadlock situation, a
temporary table created within the procedure may become stranded in tempdb.
This situation will only occur if, in addition to the temporary table, a
cursor is declared within the stored procedure, and the stored procedure
then acts upon the temporary table.
<P>
Because the standard method for handling a deadlock is to resubmit the
command that was terminated, problems may arise if that command attempts to
re-create the temporary table upon resubmission.
<P>
Specifically, error message 2714 may be reported when the query is
resubmitted, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   SQL Server message 2714, state 1, severity 16:
   There is already an object named '#temp' in the database.

</PRE>Attempts to drop the temporary table prior to re-creating it will fail, and
you will receive error message 3701:
<P>
<PRE>   SQL Server message 3701, state 1, severity 11:
   Cannot drop the table '#temp', because it doesn't exist in the system
   catalogs.

</PRE>The existence of the temporary table can be confirmed by selecting from
tempdb.sysobjects for that table.
<P>
This problem does not occur if a cursor is not used within the stored
procedure. Thus, if a cursor is absent, the temporary table is correctly
cleaned up from tempdb after a deadlock.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, try to close out the connection on which the
deadlock occurred, prior to resubmitting the command. It is not necessary
to cycle SQL Server in order to clean up an object left stranded in this
manner, because that process (and any associated resources) appear to be
released once the creating process is closed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
versions 6.0 and 6.5. This problem has been corrected in U.S. Service Pack
2 for Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5. For more information, contact your
primary support provider.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
On SQL Server 6.0, the temporary table was not left stranded after a
deadlock. However, an attempt to declare and open the cursor fails, with
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   SQL Server message 16915, state 1, severity 16:
   A cursor with the name 'cur1' already exists.

</PRE>This error message is then followed by the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   SQL Server message 16905, state 1, severity 16:
   The cursor is already open.
