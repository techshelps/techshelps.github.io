<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
For running SQL Server on a NetWare platform, Microsoft recommends the
values of several parameters to obtain optimal performance. This
article discusses their need, the default values, and why they need to
be changed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NET.CFG is a file that contains the maximum values for various network
parameters. Below are the Microsoft recommendations for the values of
various parameters in this file:
<P>
Protocol Stack SPX
<PRE>        sessions 255

</PRE>Named Pipes
<PRE>        server sessions 255
        client sessions 50
        service threads 32

</PRE>SPX is a protocol used by NetWare to manage the connections between
workstations and remote stations. The Protocol Stack SPX allows the
user to specify the characteristics of these connections. The session
entry sets the maximum number of SPX connections that the workstation
can support. In the case of a SQL Server machine, each names pipe
connection uses up one SPX connection. Thus, this has to be set to a
high value. The default value is 16, which is not enough.
<P>
<PRE>   Acceptable values: 8-255
   Default:           16

</PRE>The Named Pipes section specifies the configuration for the named
pipes protocol. The server sessions entry is the maximum number of
connections a named pipes server will support with all named pipes
clients. For a SQL Server, this number is the maximum number of
dbprocess structures that it will support. Because each named pipe
connection will use an SPX session, this entry must be less than or
equal to the sessions entry in the Protocol Stack SPX section. If it
is not, then the Requester will treat the SPX session number as the
maximum number of named pipes server sessions allowed. The default
value of 32 is just barely sufficient for even a small installation.
Note that although the acceptable maximum for this entry is 255, one
is used up by Novell diagnostics, which are automatically loaded.
Thus, 254 sessions are available to the user.
<P>
<PRE>   Acceptable values: 2-255
   Default:           32

</PRE>The client sessions entry is the maximum number of connections any one
workstation will establish with all Named Pipe Servers. For a SQL
Server, this entry indicates the maximum number of dbprocesses that
the server machine itself, acting as a client, can open. The default
value of 16 is normally enough, but to take care of occasional(and
unlikely) heavy load, it is bumped up to 50.
<P>
<PRE>   Acceptable values: 3-128
   Default:           16

</PRE>The service threads entry is the maximum number of threads the Named
Pipes server will allocate to service requests from all clients. In
the case of a SQL Server, this indicates the maximum number of
simultaneous requests that will be buffered by the server, because
SQL Server uses blocking pipes. The default value of 3 is too low.
<P>
<PRE>   Acceptable values: 1-32
   Default:           3
