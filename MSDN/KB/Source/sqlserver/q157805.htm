The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, versions 6.5
</UL> 
BUG #: 15944 (6.5)
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The RegistryRebuild option of SQL Server Setup is no longer documented.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the RegistryRebuild option, Setup presents the same dialog
boxes that it presents during a normal installation, but it does not
install or change any files. When you see the dialog boxes, ensure that the
paths are correct to the SQL files and Master.dat directories.
<P>
NOTE: Rebuilding the registry may not resolve all problems. A thorough
backup of all database files should be performed prior to registry rebuild.
<P>
<P><h3>To Rebuild the SQL Server Registry Entries</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From a command prompt, type the following:
<P>
   cd \sql\binn
   setup /t RegistryRebuild = On
<P>
   NOTE: For SQL Server version 6.0, you can use either = On or = True for
   the Setup command line.
<P>
   NOTE: For SQL Server version 6.5, the default directory is \Mssql\Binn.
<P>
   NOTE: Be sure to type the Setup command exactly as indicated, including
   capitalization. There must be a space on both sides of the equal sign.

<P><LI>Follow the directions that appear on the screen.
<P>
</OL>Setup may have difficulty locating certain .dll files. If this is the case,
try typing the following from a command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   cd \sql\dll

   ..\binn\setup /t RegistryRebuild = On

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The RegistryRebuild option can be used to recover from a situation where
the Windows NT registry has been either damaged, inadvertantly modified, or
restored. You may need to rebuild the registry for SQL Server if:

<UL><LI>The system registry was recently restored. If the registry had to be
   restored after some failure, the key for SQL Server may not exist. A
   rebuild of the registry may also be required after starting Windows NT
   using the Last Known Good option of Windows NT.

<LI>The SQL Server registry key was deleted from the registry.

<LI>Windows NT was reinstalled and SQL Server already exists, or if SQL
   Server was restored from a backup after Windows NT was reinstalled.

<LI>You receive Windows NT error 1060 (the specified service doesn't exist
   as an installed service), when you try to start SQL Server.
<P>
</UL>Additionally, in some cases, RegistryRebuild can help recover the SQL
Performance Monitor counters if they cannot be seen.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
version 6.5 documentation. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
