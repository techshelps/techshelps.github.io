</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A Macintosh client can access Microsoft SQL Server for OS/2. Currently,
there are two ways of implementing this connectivity. One is through the
use of Microsoft SQL Bridge, which is a two-way protocol gateway software
that connects Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase SQL Server environments,
enabling clients and servers to communicate across different networks. The
other option is to use TechGnosis SequeLink.
<P>
The text below describes the various ways of implementing Macintosh-SQL
Server connectivity.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>SQL Bridge Solution</h3>
 
<P>
As a protocol gateway, SQL Bridge allows Macintosh-based applications
that use Sybase's Macintosh Open Client DB-Library (DB-Lib) for TCP/IP
to communicate with SQL Server for OS/2 using named pipes. Because
Sybase's DB-Lib for Macintosh uses TCP/IP protocol support, existing
Macintosh DB-Lib applications that can connect to Sybase SQL servers on
VMS and UNIX using TCP/IP can communicate with SQL Server through SQL
Bridge and Microsoft LAN Manager's TCP/IP stack.
<P>
SQL Bridge is a protocol converter. In the case of Macintosh
connectivity, it converts TCP/IP and named pipes back and forth,
thereby establishing communication between the TCP/IP client and the
named pipes server.
<P>
To implement this connectivity, SQL Bridge must be installed on LAN Manager
version 2.1 or later with TCP/IP support. On the Macintosh client side,
some third-party products such as Omnis 5, 4th Dimension, Clear Access, or
Deft can be used as the front-ends. MacTCP, the TCP/IP stack for Macintosh,
is available from Apple. TCPort, Novell's implementation of the TCP/IP
stack for the Macintosh, can also be used in place of MacTCP. Unlike on
PCs, there are no Network Library (Net-Library) modules for the Macintosh
to connect to SQL Server. If Apple's Macintosh Programmer's Workbench (MPW)
is installed on the client, a Macintosh version of ISQL by Sybase can be
used to access SQL Server.
<P>
<P><h3>TechGnosis SequeLink Solution</h3>
 
<P>
TechGnosis has developed a version of SequeLink that allows a
Macintosh user on a LAN Manager network to access SQL Server from many
existing Macintosh applications. It uses the AppleTalk stack in the
LAN Manager services for the Macintosh to gain connectivity to SQL
Server on OS/2.
<P>
SequeLink consists of two parts: One is the server-side software called
SequeLink Router/Server for OS/2, and the other is the Macintosh client-
side software called SequeLink Client for Macintosh. The server-side
software is responsible for the communications between Macintosh clients
and SQL Server using DB-Lib. It has two pieces: One is called Server for
OS/2, which is a really a DB-Lib application; the other is called Apple
Data Stream Protocol (ADSP) Listener, which handles ADSP communication from
Macintosh clients. The client-side software has three parts in general: the
network file (similar to SQL Server's network library), the core files
(similar to SQL Server's DB-Lib), and application link, which consists of
application-dependent macros.
<P>
To use this solution, install LAN Manager 2.1 with the Macintosh
services. A third-party application is usually needed unless you
intend to interface to SequeLink using programming languages such as C
or Pascal. TechGnosis provides the application links for HyperCard,
Microsoft Excel, 4th Dimension, and Wingz.
