<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
SQL Monitor is a new facility in SQL Server 4.2 that supports the
new SQL Administrator tool. SQL Monitor connects to a SQL Server and
performs the following functions:

<UL><LI>It runs the scheduled backup engine that periodically wakes up and
   checks to see if there is a backup scheduled. If one is scheduled,
   the backup engine will dispatch it.

<LI>It runs the server statistics engine that periodically stores
   runtime statistics from the SQL Server.
<P>
</UL>Users do not execute SQL Monitor directly, it supports actions they
request through SQL Administrator. The only time SQL Monitor is
executed directly is when the system administrator decides how to
start it and what startup parameters to specify. This article
discusses the options for starting SQL Monitor and its execution
parameters.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The initial state of the backup and statistics engines are set by
parameters specified when executing SQL Monitor. Once SQL Monitor has
been started, the backup and statistics engines can be independently
and dynamically stopped or reconfigured using SQL Administrator.
Controlling the backup engine is documented in the Backup and Recovery
chapter of the SQL "System Administrator's Guide." Controlling the
statistics engine is documented in the Starting and Stopping the
Statistics Engine section of the chapter on Configuration and
Performance.
<P>
SQL Monitor itself cannot be started or stopped from SQL
Administrator; it must executed using one of three options. The three
options are documented in the section on Starting the SQL Monitor
Program in the SQL "System Administrator's Guide." Option 1 below can
be used in any network, and is the only option available for non-LAN
Manager based networks such as Novell and Banyan. Options 2 and 3 are
available only in a LAN Manager or LAN Manager-based networking
environment. SQL Monitor must be run on the same machine as the SQL
Server it is monitoring.
<P>
<P><h3>Option 1</h3>
 
<P>
SQL Monitor can be run on any OS/2 machine by invoking it from the
command line:
<P>
<PRE>   sqlmontr -parameter1 -parameter2 ....

</PRE>It is best to start sqlmontr using the OS/2 start command from
STARTUP.CMD:
<P>
<PRE>   start sqlmontr -parameter1 -parameter2 .....

</PRE>This will execute sqlmontr in its own screen session. sqlmontr can
then be stopped by terminating that screen session, or by going into
the screen session and entering CTRL+C to terminate the process.
<P>
The parameters that are valid for this method can be viewed by
entering the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   sqlmontr -?

</PRE>The usage of the parameters shown by -? are:
<P>
-P    Specifies the password for the sa userid. sqlmontr will prompt
<PRE>      for the password if -P is not specified.

</PRE>-S    Server name. Never use this parameter, sqlmontr must be on
<PRE>      the same machine as the SQL Server.

</PRE>-B    Backup sleep period (minutes). The length of time the SQL
<PRE>      Monitor backup engine will sleep between checks to see if there
      is a scheduled backup to dispatch. The default is 15 minutes.

</PRE>-A    Backup off at startup. This parameter will cause sqlmontr to
<PRE>      start with the scheduled backup engine not running. The backup
      engine can be started later using SQL Administrator. If -A is not
      specified, sqlmontr will start with the backup engine running.

</PRE>-M    Monitor sleep period (seconds). The length of time the SQL
<PRE>      Monitor statistics engine sleeps between its attempts to gather
      runtime statistics. The default is 60 seconds.

</PRE>-N    Monitor on at startup. Specifies that you want the SQL Monitor
<PRE>      statistics engine to be running when sqlmontr starts. If -N is
      not specified, sqlmontr will start with the statistics engine off.
      The statistics engine can be started later using SQL Administrator.

</PRE>-T    Monitor table max row count. The maximum number of rows in the
<PRE>      statistics engine's table for holding its history of runtime
      statistics. Sqlmontr adds one row to the table each time it gathers
      runtime statistics. If the table fills, sqlmontr will stop
      recording the runtime statistics. The table can then be cleared
      from SQL Administrator. The default is 1000 rows.

</PRE>-O    SQL connect/wait timeout period (seconds). The length of time
<PRE>      SQL Monitor will wait for a reply to any command it sends to the SQL
      Server before generating a timeout error to SQL Administrator.
      Default is 180 seconds.

</PRE><h3>Option 2</h3>
 
<P>
SQL Monitor can be executed as a LAN Manager Network Service by using
the NET START command:
<P>
<PRE>   net start sqlmonitor /parameter1 /parameter2 ....

</PRE>While the effect of starting SQL Monitor using option 2 is the same as
starting it using option 3, option 3 is the recommended method for
starting SQL Monitor under LAN Manager, and users should use it
instead of option 2. The setup requirements and parameters for option
2 are the same as those needed for option 3. There is a difference
between options 2 and 3 if password= is not specified in LANMAN.INI.
Issuing "NET START sqlmonitor" will not work unless /password= is
specified. If you issue "NETSQL START sqlmonitor" without the
/password=, you will be prompted for the password.
<P>
<P><h3>Option 3</h3>
 
<P>
The recommended way to start SQL Monitor in a LAN Manager Network
Service is by using the NETSQL START command:
<P>
<PRE>   netsql start sqlmonitor /parameter1 /parameter2 ....

</PRE>The advantage this offers over option 2 is that netsql start will do
parameter validation, which is not done by the net start command. The
advantage options 2 and 3 offer over option 1 is that the SQL Monitor
is now a network service and can be reported on and managed by the
NETSQL commands documented in the table at the top of page 14 of the
"SQL Administrator User's Guide." It can also be managed as a network
service by the LAN Manager administrator. If you execute SQLMONTR from
the command line in a LAN Manager network, the commands on page 14
will not affect it and the LAN Administrator will not be able to
manage SQL Monitor as a network service.
<P>
The steps for setting up a system to use either option 2 or 3 are
documented on pages 13-14 of the "SQL Administrator for Windows User's
Guide." The names of the SQL Monitor parameters used with NET START or
NETSQL START are different than the one letter codes used in option 1,
but their meanings are the same. The NETSQL START and NET START
versions of the parameter names are documented in the table at the
bottom of page 14 in the "SQL Administrator User's Guide." Their meanings
can be found from the descriptions given above for the corresponding
parameters in option 1.
