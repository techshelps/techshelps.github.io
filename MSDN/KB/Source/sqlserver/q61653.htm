<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The clearest explanation of two-phase and three-phase commits is in
Ullman's "Baseball Database" book. The reference to this publication
does not represent a recommendation by Microsoft to use this book as a
database reference; however, the information regarding two-phase and
three-phase commits is helpful to understand these concepts.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Two-phase commit is defined to be the following:
<P>
<PRE>   A participant commits when it knows that all other participants
   have voted to commit.

</PRE>Three-phase commit is defined to be the following:
<P>
<PRE>   A participant commits when it knows that all other participants
   know that all participants have voted to commit.

</PRE>The extra phase reduces the amount of time that locks must be held if
a failure occurs. Any participant that had received a commit or abort
message can respond to a "help-me" message from a participant that is
unsure of the state of the transaction. It is not necessary to hold
all the locks until the coordinator gets back up.
