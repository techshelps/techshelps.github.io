<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When Microsoft SQL Server for OS/2 is run on a Microsoft LAN Manager Peer
server, some problems may occur that usually do not arise if SQL
Server is run on a full server. This article attempts to address these
problems in a question-and-answer format.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. I have installed my SQL Server on a Peer server in a domain with
      user-level security. In order for a user to access the SQL
      server successfully, I have to add a network account for this
      user on the Peer server even if this account already exists in
      the domain and is validated by the domain controller. Why is
      this?

   A. In user-level security, if a server is set up as a member server
      (or a backup server) in a domain, the logon to the server is
      validated by the domain controller using the logon security
      mechanism. A user account needs to be added only once to the
      domain, and the domain's servers that participate in the logon
      security keep and use the identical copies of a single,
      domain-wide user account database.

      In the case of a Peer server, however, this mechanism can't be
      implemented. A Peer server cannot be configured as a member
      server in a domain because it does not support the Netlogon
      service, which is required for participating in logon security.
      Rather, it must be configured as a stand-alone server, and
      separate accounts must be added for each individual user.

2. Q. A SQL server is installed on a Peer server in a domain. But when
      I use the System Administration Facility (SAF) or other querying
      tools, I can't see this SQL server name in the list box even
      though other SQL server names are listed correctly. Why?

   A. A Peer server is hidden in a domain by default. To make it
      visible in the domain, set the srvhidden entry in the LANMAN.INI
      file to NO by specifying "srvhidden=no".

3. Q. The Peer service allows only one connection to the Peer server's
      shared resources at a time. If SQL Server runs on a Peer server,
      can more than one user connect to the SQL Server?

   A. Yes. Although only one user at a time can connect to most of the
      Peer server's shared resources, there is no limit on the number
      of users who can use the Peer service's IPC$ resource, which
      provides multiple users access to the applications that use
      named pipes, such as SQL Server.
