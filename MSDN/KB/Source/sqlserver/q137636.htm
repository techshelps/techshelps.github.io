<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, versions 4.21x, 6.0 &amp; 6.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses when you should run INSTCAT.SQL against your SQL
Server to support a Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver version. Note that
this information applies only to the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver; if
you are using SQL Server ODBC drivers from other vendors, consult the
documentation for those drivers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Both the SQL Server system catalog stored procedures and the ODBC API
catalog functions address the need of applications to retrieve catalog
information from a database. Because there is a high correlation between
the ODBC catalog functions and the SQL Server system catalog stored
procedures, the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver implements many of the
ODBC API catalog functions as calls to a corresponding SQL Server system
catalog procedure. The driver is therefore dependent on the system catalog
stored procedures in any SQL Server to which it connects.
<P>
Each version of the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver is developed in
conjunction with a specific version of SQL Server. The proper operation of
each driver version requires the versions of the system catalog stored
procedures associated with the specific version of SQL Server with which
the driver was developed, or a later version of the procedures. For
example, the 2.00.1912 driver was developed in conjunction with Microsoft
SQL Server version 4.21a, and requires either the versions of the system
catalog stored procedures that were released with SQL Server 4.21a or with
later versions, such as 6.0. The driver will not work properly with older
versions of the catalog stored procedures, such as those in SQL Server
version 4.21.
<P>
If a driver attempts to connect to a SQL Server that is running an older
version of the system catalog stored procedures than those required by the
driver, the connection will complete with SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO and a call
to SQLError will return the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   SqlState:   01000
   pfNative:   0
   szErrorMsg: "[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]The ODBC
               catalog stored procedures installed on server
               ab421def are version 02.00.4127; version 06.00.0115
               or later is required to ensure proper operation.
               Please contact your system administrator."

</PRE>Although the connection is successful, the application will later
encounter errors on calls to the ODBC API Catalog functions.
<P>
You can determine what version of INSTCAT.SQL was last run against
your SQL Server by running the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   sp_server_info 500

</PRE>The result of running this query against SQL Server 6.5 is:
<P>
<PRE>   attribute_id   attribute_name      attribute_value
   --------------------------------------------------
   500            SYS_SPROC_VERSION   6.50.193

</PRE>The result of running this query against SQL Server 6.0 is:
<P>
<PRE>   attribute_id   attribute_name      attribute_value
   --------------------------------------------------
   500            SYS_SPROC_VERSION   6.00.120

</PRE>The result of running this query against SQL Server 4.21a is:
<P>
<PRE>   attribute_id   attribute_name      attribute_value
   --------------------------------------------------
   500            SYS_SPROC_VERSION   2.00.4127

</PRE>The following chart shows the relationships between recent Microsoft
SQL Server ODBC Drivers and their corresponding SQL Server versions:
<P>
<PRE>ODBC Version    SQL Server Version     Date of INSTCAT.SQL
------------    ------------------     -------------------

1.02.3231*          4.21                  1/26/94
2.00.1912*          4.21a                 7/15/94
2.50.0121           6.00.0121             6/7/95
2.50.0126           6.00.0124 (SP 1)      6/7/95
2.65.0201           6.50.0201             4/3/96

</PRE>* - These drivers are obsolete and no longer ship with current Microsoft
products.
<P>
The SQL Server database administrator (DBA) can install the proper version
of the SQL Server system catalog stored procedures on the target server by
running the INSTCAT.SQL script from the SQL Server install directory. This
procedure should never be run by a general user, but only by the DBA. The
only time running this script is necessary is if you have clients using
ODBC drivers attempting to connect to older versions of SQL Server. The
system catalog stored procedures installed by INSTCAT.SQL are backward-
compatible. If you run a newer INSTCAT.SQL script against an older SQL
Server, the only effect is that the system catalog stored procedures will
be upgraded to a level that will support the newer versions of ODBC
drivers. No user data will be changed, and existing applications and the
older ODBC drivers will continue to work.
<P>
You should never run an INSTCAT.SQL script against any version of SQL
Server if the date or version of the INSTCAT.SQL you want to run is older
than the INSTCAT.SQL that came with your SQL Server. The INSTCAT.SQL that
comes with SQL Server is stored in the directory MSSQL\INSTALL (6.5),
SQL60\INSTALL (6.0), or SQL\INSTALL (4.21A or earlier), assuming SQL Server
was installed into its default directory structure.
<P>
If you are running multiple versions of the Microsoft ODBC SQL Server
drivers against a server, ensure that the server is running with at least
the version of INSTCAT.SQL associated with the newest ODBC driver you are
using. For example, you would need to check this if you are running
multiple version 4.21a servers and then get SQL Server version 6.0 and
upgrade some of your clients to use the new 2.50.0121 driver that comes
with version 6.0. In this case, you will need to run the 6.0 version of
INSTCAT.SQL against the 4.21a servers before the new driver can connect to
the old servers. The clients will still be able to connect to the old
servers with their existing 2.00.1912 ODBC driver.
<P>
In general, you should use the INSTCAT.SQL script that ships with SQL
Server. The exeption to this would be if you have clients that start
running ODBC drivers that require a later version of INSTCAT.SQL than came
with the version of SQL Server you are running. For example, Office 95
shipped with the 2.50.0121 driver and the SQL Server 6.0 INSTCAT.SQL
script. If you are running SQL Server 4.21a and some of your clients
install this driver, you will have to run the INSTCAT.SQL that shipped with
Office 95 against the version 4.21a server before the new ODBC drivers can
connect.
<P>
In all of these cases, you need to observe the rule not to run an
INSTCAT.SQL onto any server whose original INSTCAT.SQL is newer than
the one you want to run.
<P>
You should run the INSTCAT.SQL script into the server with the command line
ISQL utility, which is documented in the SQL Server "Transact-SQL
Reference" manual:
<P>
<PRE>   cd \sql60\install
   isql /Usa /Ppassword /Sservername /iinstcat.sql /oinstcat.rpt
