<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft SQL Server version 4.2 for OS/2
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Users making many updates to system tables may fill their master
database. The most common symptom is to receive the following message
(1105 error):
<P>
<PRE>   Can't allocate space for object syslogs in database master because
   the logsegment is full. If you ran out of space in syslogs, dump the
   transaction log. Otherwise use ALTER DATABASE or sp_extendsegment to
   increase the size of the segment.

</PRE>This article outlines the steps users can follow to safely recover
from this condition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Users can reduce the chances of filling the master database in two
ways. First, no user information should be stored in the master
database, it should be reserved for system level information. Second,
users with SQL Server version 4.2a patch K9 or later can set the
database option truncate log on checkpoint in the master database:
<P>
<PRE>   sp_dboption master,'trunc.',true

</PRE>SQL Server 4.2a patch K9 can be obtained through your reseller or your
usual support provider.
<P>
If a user receives an 1105 error message referencing the table syslogs
in master, the response depends on several factors.
<P>
If the user has not yet shut down the system, they can simply log on
as the SA user and type the following:
<P>
<PRE>   dump transaction master with no_log

</PRE>If the user has shut down the system, and they have SQL Server version
4.2a patch K7 or later, they can restart the system and use the above
procedure to dump transaction master with no_log.
<P>
Use the following procedures if the system is shutdown, SQL Server
version 4.2aK7 is not available, and the system is needed before a
version 4.2aK7 or later patch can be received. The procedures depend
on having the script MASTER.SQL found at the bottom of this article
keyed in as a file on the user system. Note: The following steps
assume that MASTER.DAT and the errorlog are in their default
locations, if they are not, adjust the paths accordingly.
<P>
If the user has a valid, current dump of the master database, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Back up the existing system. At a minimum, back up MASTER.DAT.

<P><LI>Bring up SQL Server in bypass recovery mode:
<P>
<P><PRE>      sqlservr /d c:\sql\data\master.dat /e c:\sql\log\errorlog -T3607
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run MASTER.SQL and print the resulting MASTER.RPT:
<P>
<P><PRE>      isql /Usa /P&lt;sa password&gt; /e /imaster.sql /omaster.rpt
      copy master.rpt lpt1
</PRE>
<P><LI>Log in as SA, dump transaction master with no_log. Shut down SQL
   Server.

<P><LI>Bring up SQL Server in single user mode:
<P>
<P><PRE>      sqlservr /d c:\sql\data\master.dat /e c:\sql\log\errorlog /m
</PRE>
<P><LI>Log in as SA and load the master database from the dump file.
   Remember that SQL Server will shut down automatically after completing
   a load of master.

<P><LI>Restart SQL Server as usual. Rerun the query from step 3 and ensure
   the data in the system tables matches that in the old system.
<P>
</OL>If the user does not have a valid, current dump of the master
database, they will have to rebuild the master device. This is a
complex process and should be done under the supervision of the site's
primary support provider.

<OL><P><LI>Back up the existing system. At a minimum, back up MASTER.DAT and
    the SQL Server executable directories.

<P><LI>Bring up SQL Server in bypass recovery mode:
<P>
       sqlservr.exe /d c:\sql\data\master.dat /e c:\sql\log\errorlog -T3607

<P><LI>Review existing errorlog to determine "character set" (either code
    page 850 or 437) and the "default sort order" (write down the ID =
    value).
<P>
<PRE>       code page     =
       sort order ID =

</PRE><P><LI>Run MASTER.SQL and print resulting MASTER.RPT:
<P>
       isql /Usa /P&lt;sa password&gt; /e /imaster.sql /omaster.rpt
       copy master.rpt lpt1

<P><LI>Shut down SQL Server.

<P><LI>Rename the c:\sql\data\master.dat file (this should be deleted only
    after a successful completion of this process has been ensured).

<P><LI>Rebuild MASTER.DAT using the following steps:
<P>
    a. Run the SQL Server setup program from the Setup Disk 1.
       Make sure you choose the same code page and sort order
       determined in step 3. Refer to Sort Order chart below if
       you are unsure which option to choose. You must also
       specify the same size, in megabytes for the MASTER.DAT file.
<P>
    b. Once Setup is complete, you will have a new MASTER.DAT.
<P>
    c. Restart SQL Server in single user mode:
<P>
       sqlservr.exe /d c:\sql\data\master.dat /e c:\sql\log\errorlog /m

<P><LI>Using the output of the MASTER.SQL from step 4, do
    sp_addumpdevice's for all dump devices which existed in the old
    system.
<P>
    Do DISK REINIT's for all user devices. To determine the vdevno to
    specify for each user device, divide that device's value from the low
    column in sysdevices by 16777216. The low value can be seen in the
    print of MASTER.RPT from step 4. Determine the size by dividing the
    number of bytes in the .DAT file by 2048. The number of bytes in the
    .DAT file can be determined from a dir command listing of the
    directory holding the .DAT file.
<P>
    Do a DISK REFIT to rebuild the sysusages and sysdatabases tables.
<P>
    (See the "Language Reference" and the "System Administrator's Guide"
    for details on how to run DISK REINIT and DISK REFIT.)

<P><LI>Do sp_addlogin's for all logins that existed in the old system.
    Note that the logins have to be entered in exactly the same sequence
    in which they existed in the old system. Any 'gaps' in the sequence of
    said numbers must be filled in with a dummy login until all logins
    have been entered.

<P><LI>Redefine any remote logins or remote servers that were defined in
    the old system.

<P><LI>Using the output of the MASTER.SQL query from step 4, issue any
    needed sp_configure parameters to reset the values to those of the old
    system.

<P><LI>Rerun the MASTER.SQL query as in step 4. Compare the output of the
    new MASTER.RPT against the output of the old MASTER.RPT, ensure that
    the new values are the same. If there are discrepancies, contact your
    primary support provider to determine how they should be addressed.

<P><LI>Reload any other databases, other than tempdb, that also reside on the
    MASTER.DAT device. The other exception would be the model database if
    it contains no user data. If there was any user data on MASTER.DAT
    which was not covered by a valid dump, the user will have to recreate
    the data.

<P><LI>Shut down, and then restart SQL Server. Run a dbcc checkdb and a
    dbcc checkalloc on all the databases in the system. If these checks
    are successful, back up the system before letting users back on.
    At this point, you can also delete the old master device that was
    renamed in step 5.

<P><LI>If the site was running a SQL Server patch in addition to the
    version installed from the Setup disk, they should now reapply the
    patch following the README.TXT instructions on the patch disk.
<P>
</OL><h3>MASTER.SQL</h3>
 
<P>
MASTER.SQL is a script to extract data from master database system
tables. This information is used after MASTER.DAT has been rebuilt to
recreate login id's, and so on. Type the following as a file
MASTER.SQL:
<P>
use master
go
<P>
select sd.dbid, dbname = convert(char(10), sd.name),
<PRE>       su.segmap, su.lstart, su.size, su.vstart
</PRE></OL>from sysusages su, sysdatabases sd
where su.dbid = sd.dbid
go
<P>
select low, high, status,
<PRE>       devname = convert(char(13), name),
       physname = convert(char(23), phyname)
</PRE>from sysdevices
go
<P>
