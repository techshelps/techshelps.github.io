The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, version 6.5
</UL> 
BUG #: 17090
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Scheduled tasks of type CmdExec may cause an exception violation. A message
similar to the following will appear in the Event Viewer:
<P>
<PRE>   EventID: 212
   Source: SQLExecutive
   User: N/A
   Type: Error
   Category: Task Engine

   Task &lt;task no&gt;, '&lt;task name&gt;' has caused an exception violation in the
   CmdExec subsystem, and has been terminated.

</PRE>Even if the scheduled task, (that is, SQLMaint), completes successfully, it
shows a Last Run Status of "Failed" in the Manage Scheduled Tasks screen
within SQL Enterprise Manager. The Task History screen does not display any
error message to explain the failure.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is a result of a problem with the CmdExec utility. While
running, Cmdexec.dll creates a temporary file that holds the redirected
stdio and stderr output for the task. If the number of bytes within this
file happens to be within certain ranges, an exception violation is
generated.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, adjust the size of the output written to stdio
and stderr by the CmdExec task being scheduled. If you are unsure about
what output is being generated, try running the task at a command prompt
and observing the results written to the screen. Increase or reduce the
number of bytes written by at least two bytes to avoid exposure to this
problem.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SQL Server
version 6.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The nature of this problem is such that there is only a small chance that a
given CmdExec task will be affected.
<P>
An example would be if you scheduled SQLMaint to perform routine database
maintenance and noticed that the database maintenance report shows
successful completion but the task reports failure in the Task Manager
screen in SQL Enterprise Manager.
<P>
Because the output produced is saved to the report (.rpt) file, there is no
need to run this from the command prompt to view the stdio and stderr
listings. An example of a SQLMaint report file is shown below.
<P>
By reviewing this output, you can decide on the most appropriate means of
causing the byte-count to be increased or reduced by at least two (for
example, by changing the dump file name in paragraph 7 or by ensuring that
the database is in single user mode so that the WARNING in paragraph 2 is
suppressed).
<P>
The following is a sample SQLMaint report:
