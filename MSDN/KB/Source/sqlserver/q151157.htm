<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server, versions 6.0 &amp; 6.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, the default number of maximum concurrent
SQLExec tasks using a DB-Library connection has been increased to 61. This
value is also configurable via a registry entry.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The limitation can be adjusted by adding the MaxDBProcesses Value Name to
the following registry entry:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE: SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\SQLExecutive

</PRE>The value should be added as a Data Type of REG_DWORD. Possible values are
from 10 to 255 (Decimal). Please note that the actual number of concurrent
tasks allowed will be two less (three less for SQL Server 6.5) than the
number you specify in the registry value to allow for SQLExecutive
overhead.
<P>
In Microsoft SQL Server version 6.0, this limitation defaults to 23 and is
not configurable. Any task that is executed using DB-Library above this
number will typically fail with a standard "Unable to connect to &lt;server&gt;"
message written to the Task History.
<P>
<P>
A Transact-SQL task requires one DB-Library connection while LogReader and
SYNC tasks each require two separate DB-Library connections. A Distribution
task will only require one DB-Library connection when processing a "SYNC"
job to a SQL Server subscriber. "SYNC" jobs occur because of an initial
automatic synchronization or scheduled table refresh event. If a LogReader
task is configured to run as "AutoStart" it will keep open its DB-Library
connection(s) until the task is shutdown or fails. The Distribution task
will only keep its DB-Library connection open when processing a "SYNC" job
until the job completes even if it is scheduled as "AutoStart".
<P>
See Knowledge Base article <B><A HREF="../SQLSERVER/Q89937.htm">Q89937</A></B>, "INF: Getting Started with Microsoft SQL
Server Replication," for more information about replication tasks.
<P>
If you encounter this problem on a distribution server using SQL Server 6.0
replication, use the following techniques:

<OL><P><LI>Schedule replication tasks so that the limit will not be reached keeping
   in mind the above description of how many DB-Library connections each
   task can consume.

<P><LI>Spread the load of replication tasks across separate distribution
   servers. This can be accomplished by selectively grouping publishing
   servers with several different distribution servers instead of using
   one dedicated distribution server.
<P>
</OL>CmdExec tasks are not included in this calculation even if they execute a
program that uses DB-Library (like ISQL.EXE) because a separate process is
spawned to run this type of task.
