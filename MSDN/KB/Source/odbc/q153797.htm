The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Open Database Connectivity version 2.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When an ODBC application makes a certain sequence of calls to connect to an
ODBC driver, a memory loss on the order of a few hundred bytes may occur
due to a memory leak in the Driver Manager. The sequence that results in
the memory leak is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   SQLAllocEnv
   SQLAllocConnect
   SQLConnect or SQLDriverConnect
   SQLDisconnect
   SQLFreeConnect
   SQLFreeEnv

</PRE>This leak affects only those applications that connect and disconnect
frequently without ever exiting the application. For SQL Server replication
users, this problem is encountered when a distribution server connects to
subscription servers as an ODBC client.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
An application can share connections. If an application needs to connect
and disconnect frequently, you can shut down the application periodically.
For example, if an application is running as a Windows NT service, you can
periodically shut down and restart the service in order to clean up the
memory leak.
<P>
Under Windows NT and Windows 95, each application has its own memory
address space. After the application is shut down, Windows NT and Windows
95 will clean up the application's memory space, including the memory leak.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Open Database
Connectivity version 2.5.x. This problem has been corrected in Microsoft
Open Database Connectivity version 3.0.x.
