The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the DLLs and other files that you need to
redistribute in order to use a specific Microsoft Desktop Database ODBC
Driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Appnote:</h3>
 
The ODBC Desktop Database Driver Pack (DDP) v3.0 is available as an appnote
from Microsoft Technical Support. This pack has the Microsoft SQL Server
and Visigenic Oracle drivers (client/server databases) apart from the
Microsoft Access, FoxPro, dBase, Paradox, Microsoft Excel, and Text
(desktop databases) drivers. If you have the appnote and would like to
redistribute one or more drivers, refer to the ODBC.INF file for
information on the DLLs required.
<P>
The ODBC DDP 3.0 uses the ACME setup program and accordingly the format of
ODBC.INF has been changed from ODBC version 2.0. Most the sections in this
file have a 'DA' prefix. In the following, this prefix has been omitted for
brevity. Unless otherwise noted, the files are common to both Windows NT
and Windows 95.
<P>
ODBC core components include the driver manager, cursor library, installer,
and thunking (optional) files. These files should be installed regardless
of the driver you would like to redistribute. The files are listed under
the following sections:

<UL><LI>ODBC Driver Manager
<LI>ODBC
<LI>ODBC Administrator
<LI>Generic Thunk ODBC Driver Manager
<LI>Generic Thunk DLL
<P>
</UL>You also need the files under the following sections:

<UL><LI>Shared MSVC Components
<LI>CTL3D-NT (only on Windows NT)
<P>
</UL>The following sections include common files for the Microsoft Access,
FoxPro, dBase, Paradox, Excel, and Text drivers:

<UL><LI>Desktop Driver Components
<LI>Shared VBA Components
<LI>Desktop Help Files
<P>
</UL>To install a specific desktop database driver, you need the files under the
[Driver Name] and [Driver Name-IISAM] sections. The [Driver Name] section
has the setup DLL(s), if there is a separate setup DLL for the driver, and
the [Driver Name-IISAM] has the driver ISAM files. For example, to know
about the files for the Microsoft Excel driver, you should look under the
following sections:

<UL><LI>Excel
<LI>Excel-IISAM
<P>
</UL>For the Microsoft SQL Server driver, look under the following sections:

<UL><LI>SQLServer
<LI>MS CP Translators
<LI>SQLServer Help Files
<P>
</UL>For the Visigenic Oracle Driver, look under the following sections:

<UL><LI>Oracle
<LI>Oracle Help Files
<LI>CTL3D-W95-VSORA      (Only on Windows 95)
<P>
</UL>In this appnote, there is a ODBCKEY.INF file that contains information
about the keywords for each driver. This information will be written to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC\ODBCINST.INI in the registry. You should
modify the ODBCKEY.INF file by removing the driver sections for the drivers
that you do not want to install. For example, remove the 'TEXT' section, if
you do not want to install the Text driver.
<P>
<P><h3>Visual C++ 4.1 Compact Disc:</h3>
 
The redistributable ODBC components and drivers are available under the
Msdev\Redist directory. The ODBC.INF in this directory is similar to the
one in the appnote mentioned above. Follow the same steps listed under the
appnote section to redistribute the drivers.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes:</h3>
 
You can use the setup program (SETUP.EXE) in the appnote to redistribute
the drivers. Note that SETUP.EXE uses ACMESETUP.EXE. Your installation
disks should have these two EXEs, the modified ODBC.INF, and ODBCKEY.INF
files (that include only the drivers that you want to redistribute), and
all the files listed in the modified ODBC.INF. Make sure that the following
sections of ODBC.INF are not removed:

<UL><LI>Source Media Descriptions
<LI>Default File Settings
<LI>Win95QFE (Only on Windows 95)
<P>
</UL>You can also write your own installation program using either the ODBC
Installer API or a third party installation software. Use the information
provided in the above section(s) for the list of files needed by a driver.
For information on using the ODBC 2.5 installer API and installation
changes, refer to README25.TXT in the appnote.
<P>
If you would like to use the ODBC 2.0 Installer API, for information on
using the ODBC Installer DLL, and other important information about
installing ODBC files, see Chapter 19, "Installing ODBC Software" under
Part 4, Installing and Configuring ODBC Software in the Microsoft ODBC 2.0
"Programmer's Reference and SDK Guide."
<P>
If you want an ODBC 2.0 formatted INF file, refer to the VCODBC.INF file
under the Msdev\Redist directory of the VC++ 4.1 compact disc.
