<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Visigenic 32-bit ODBC driver for ORACLE 7 works on the Windows NT
operating system using ORACLE SQL*NET components for Windows NT 3.51.
Currently, Windows 95 is not a supported platform with respect to the
Visigenic 32-bit ORACLE ODBC Driver. Microsoft Corporation will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
NOTE: Windows 95 is supported by the Microsoft Oracle driver. To determine
if the version of Oracle you are using is supported by this driver, refer
to the driver docmentation. For information on obtaining the driver, which
includes the documentation, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../VBWIN/Q175018.htm">Q175018</A></B>
   TITLE     : HOWTO: Acquire and Install the Microsoft Oracle ODBC Driver
               v2.0

</PRE>Currently the Visigenic 32-bit ORACLE ODBC driver is supported with ORACLE
7.0 and 7.1 database servers.
<P>
Visigenic Corporation has developed a 16-bit version of their ODBC Oracle
Driver. Microsoft Corporation neither ships nor specifically endorses this
16-bit driver. The information provided in this paragraph is for the
express purpose of informing Microsoft customers on available 16-bit
options for accessing Oracle data in an ODBC manner. Customers interested
in obtaining this 16-bit driver should send Internet mail to
sales@visigenic.com.
<P>
The last time that 16-bit ORACLE ODBC drivers were released by Microsoft
Corporation was with the ODBC Desktop Database Drivers 2.0. There were two
16-bit ORACLE drivers included with this release. There was a 16-bit
ORACLE ODBC Driver designed for use with ORACLE 6.x servers. This driver
had a version number of 1.00.3112 and was developed by PageAhead Software
Corporation on behalf of Microsoft and Oracle Corporation. The second 16-
bit ORACLE driver included in this kit has a version number of 1.11.0000
and was designed for use with ORACLE 7.0 servers. It was developed by
Oracle Corporation. Microsoft recommends that ODBC developers and users
migrate as soon as possible to 32-bit ODBC ORACLE drivers. The ODBC
Desktop Database Drivers 2.0 kit was released in late 1994 and there are
no plans to release any updates to 16-bit ODBC components from this kit.
If it is critical for you to obtain the 16-bit versions of the ODBC ORACLE
drivers, you may still order this kit directly from Microsoft by calling 1-
800-360-7561 and refer to part number #273-054-030. The charge is $5.25
plus shipping and handling. This driver kit is also still released as a
part of the 16-bit components included with the Microsoft Developer
Network Subscription (MSDN). The Professional and Enterprise (formerly
known at Level 2 and Level 3) Subscriptions include these 16-bit drivers.
For more information on obtaining MSDN, call 1-800-759-5474 or search

<P><h3>Using the 32-bit Oracle7 Driver on the Windows NT Operating System</h3>
 
<P>
In order to function in a Windows NT environment, the 32-bit Oracle7
driver uses the Oracle NT 3.51 networking components. The Oracle7
driver has been tested against the following versions of SQL*Net.
Visigenic Corporation recommends that you use these versions or
later:
<P>
<PRE>PLATFORM:                VERSION OF CLIENT LIBRARIES:

Windows NT 3.51          SQL*Net version 1.1
                         SQL*Net version 2.1

</PRE><h3>Using the 32-bit Oracle7 Driver on the Windows 95 Operating System</h3>
 
<P>
The following information pertains to using the Visigenic 32-bit
Oracle7 driver on Windows 95.
<P>
Currently, Windows 95 is not a supported platform with respect to the
Visigenic 32-bit Oracle ODBC Driver. Microsoft Corporation will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
However, there is a workaround that allows you to use the Oracle7 driver
on the Windows 95 operating system.
<P>
WARNING: This workaround has not been exhaustively tested by Visigenic
Corporation and Visigenic Corporation cannot assure that it will work with
all ODBC functions. Oracle Corporation neither supports nor acknowledges
this configuration of their SQL*NET components. This workaround should be
used for development and testing purposes only and not in a production
environment.
<P>
When Oracle Corporation ships a general release version of the networking
components that support Windows 95, Visigenic Corporation will certify the
Visigenic 32-bit Oracle driver with the Oracle SQL*NET components for
Windows 95 and if necessary make an upgraded driver available that works
with these components.
<P>
This workaround works with SQL*Net 1.1 but will not connect with SQL*Net
2.0 or later versions.
<P>
To use the driver, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Install the Oracle NT 3.51 components. These components are available
   on either the Oracle7 Server 7.1.3.3.6 CD, the Oracle Workgroup 2000
   CD, or the Oracle Products for Windows NT version 7.1 CD.
<P>
   Choose Custom Install and install the following components:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Required Support Files 7.1.3.3.6
      SQL*Net TCP/IP Client 1.1.6.8
</PRE><P>
   This combination contains the files that the Oracle7 driver needs,
   which include:
<P>
<P><PRE>      corent23.dll
      msvcrt10.dll
      orant71.dll
      sqltcpnt.dll
</PRE><P>
   The Oracle7 driver is dependent on one additional file that is not
   installed by the Oracle installer setup:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ctl3d32.dll
</PRE><P>
   This file must reside in the C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. Both Visual
   Basic 4.0 and Visual C++ 4.0 ship with this file.

<P><LI>During the installation process, ORACLE entries are made in the
   Windows 95 registry. These entries may need to be removed. After the
   installation process is complete, start the registry editor (regedit)
   with the /v option. Search through the registry and remove any ORACLE
   entries. These entries should be found under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
   root in the SOFTWARE key. This will clean up the registry and force
   the system to use the environment variable "PATH" to find the Oracle
   components.
<P>
   A side effect of removing the registry entries is that some taskbar
   menu items created by the Oracle installer will no longer function.
   These are not important to the functioning of ODBC and can be removed
   at your discretion.

<P><LI>Once the registry entries are removed, add the Oracle installation
   directory \BIN to the search path. Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file that is
   located in the root directory (if one is not already present, then
   create it), and add the directory to the path. For example, if Oracle
   has been installed in C:\ORANT, then add the following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      PATH=c:\orant\bin;%PATH%
</PRE>
<P><LI>Other registry entries specific to the Visigenic Oracle7 driver may
   need to be edited. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE root in the SOFTWARE
   hive, search for a key called ODBC. Inside that key is another subkey
   called ODBCINST.INI. Inside that subkey are additional subkeys,
   including ODBC Drivers and Visigenic Oracle7.
<P>
   The ODBC Drivers folder must contain at least one entry. Entries
   consist of a Name and the corresponding data. Name must be set to
   "Visigenic Oracle7" and Data must be set to "Installed."
<P>
   The Visigenic Oracle7 subkey must contain at least two entries. For the
   first entry, Name must be set to "Driver" and Data must be set to
   "C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\vsorac32.dll". FFor the second entry, Name must be
   set to "Setup" and Data must be set to
   "C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\vsorac32.dll".
   Note that the Data value is the same for both Name entries.
<P>
   If the Visigenic Oracle7 subkey did not exist in the ODBCINST.INI
   subkey, you must create it. Note that the entries in the ODBCINST.INI
   subkey should match those in a file in your C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM called
   ODBCINST.INI, but it is not sufficient to edit this file, because the
   registry does not automatically import information from this file, even
   when you reboot your workstation.

<P><LI>You then need to add a "services" file to your windows directory. If
   you had previously connected to Oracle under Windows 3.1, this file
   will normally be included in your Windows 3.1 TCP/IP connectivity
   directory, which is specific to your TCP/IP connectivity software. In
   that directory there should be a file named "services" (or
   SERVICES.TXT). Copy this file into your Windows directory. This file
   should be named "services" with no file extension.
<P>
   Below is an example of what this file might look like. This example is
   taken from a Visigenic internal configuration. The number of entries
   and the numeric values in yours will be different from this one. The
   important thing is that the file contains a reference to "orasrv".
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\WINDOWS\services:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>      sqlexec      1525/tcp   (not required)
      orasrv      1526/tcp   (required entry)
      informixse      1527/tcp   (not required)
      online7      1537/tcp   (not required)

   If you cannot find the "services" file or do not know how to interpret
   the entries in it, please speak to your system administrator.

</PRE><P><LI>Reboot and run.

<P><LI>Remember to use the SQL*Net 1.1 connection string syntax and not the
   SQL*Net 2.1 syntax. The connection string format is:
<P>
<P><PRE>      t:{server name}:{database name}
</PRE><P>
   where "t" signifies connections using the TCP/IP protocol.
<P>
   For example, using TCP/IP with a server named "mickey" and the database
   instance of "ora1", the following connect string would be used:
<P>
<P><PRE>      t:mickey:ora1
