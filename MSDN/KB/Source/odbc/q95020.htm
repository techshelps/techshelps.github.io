<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To be able to properly access a SQL Server from an ODBC application on
Novell NIK, the correct net-library and the network name have to be
specified. Otherwise, you will not be able to connect. Also, there is
a danger of breaking the existing DB-LIBRARY (db-lib) applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft SQL Server Network Integration Kit for Novell NetWare
(Novell NIK) enables clients to communicate with Microsoft SQL Server
and Microsoft Open Data Services using the Novell IPX/SPX protocol. It
eliminates the need for named pipes support software on MS-DOS and
Windows-based clients.
<P>
For the rest of this article, it is assumed that you are connecting to
a SQL Server called "Mysqlsvr" from an ODBC application, using Novell
NIK. This is server should be setup as an ODBC Data Source using the
ODBC Administrator Utility. Open up the ODBC Administrator, and choose
SQL Server from the list of installed drivers. Choose Add New Name. In
the ODBC SQL Server Setup dialog box, type a data source name. Note
that a single server can function as multiple ODBC Data Sources,
because each database in the server can be a data source. So, the data
source name need not necessarily be the same as the servername.
<P>
Choose Add after typing in the data source name. In the resulting
dialog box, the Network Address field will have a default entry of
the form:
<P>
<PRE>   \\data-source-name\pipe\sql\query

</PRE>This is actually a named pipe name. Because the Novell NIK does not
use named pipes, this name will not work. Change this so that it
contains the actual servername. In this example, this field should
have "mysqlsvr". The Network Library field has a default entry of
dbnmp3. This is the net-library if you are using named pipes. Change
this to read "dbmsspx3". This is the net-library for Novell NIK.
Choose OK to get back to the initial screen. The addition of the data
source is now complete.
<P>
If this procedure is not done properly, then there is a possibility
that the existing db-library applications will be unable to connect.
Specifically, this will happen if the data source name is the same as
the servername and the changes described above are not made.
<P>
Finally, note that if the above procedure is followed correctly, then
the following changes appear in the ODBC.INI and WIN.INI files. The
[Data Sources] section of ODBC.INI will have an entry of the form:
<P>
<PRE>   data-source-name=SQL Server

</PRE>where "data-source-name" is the name of the data source that you
added. There will be a new section called [data-source-name]
containing the location of the SQL Server driver and a description of
the data source. The [SQLSERVER} section of the WIN.INI will contain
an entry of the form:
<P>
<PRE>   data-source-name=dbmsspx3,servername
</PRE>
