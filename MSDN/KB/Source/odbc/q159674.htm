<PRE>              Note About the Microsoft License Agreement

</PRE>In using this software product you implicitly agree to the terms of
the applicable license agreement, which follows at the end of this
Application Note.
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installation</h3>
 
<P>
To install the Microsoft ODBC drivers, do the following:
<P>
This procedure assumes that you have already downloaded and extracted the
compressed file to a folder on drive C named Wx1350.

<OL><P><LI>If you are running Windows 95, click the Start button, and then
   click Run. (If you are running Windows NT 3.51, click Run from the File
   menu in either Program Manager or File Manager.)

<P><LI>In the Open box (or in the Command Line box of Windows NT 3.51), type
   the following command, and then click OK:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\wx1350\dataacc
</PRE>
<P><LI>Follow the Setup instructions on the screen. Note that the Setup
   program also runs the ODBC Administrator (Odbcad32.exe), which
   enables you to set up data sources for the Microsoft ODBC drivers.
<P>
</OL><h3>Help Files for ODBC Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
This Application Note includes the following two driver-specific
Help files:

<UL><LI>The ODBC SQL Server Help file (Drvssrvr.hlp) contains information

   contains information about adding and modifying Microsoft Jet
   database engine data sources, connecting to and deleting data
   sources, and levels of ODBC conformance. The Odbcjet.hlp file
   contains a "Product Support" topic with details about ODBC
   support offerings from Microsoft. The Odbcjtnw.hlp file is a
   subset of the Odbcjet.hlp file and describes new features of the
   ODBC drivers.

END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR MICROSOFT SOFTWARE
IMPORTANT_READ CAREFULLY: This Microsoft End-User License Agreement
("EULA") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a
single entity) and Microsoft Corporation for the Microsoft software
accompanying this EULA, which includes computer software and may
include associated media, printed materials, and "online" or
electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE PRODUCT" or "SOFTWARE"). By
exercising your rights to make and use copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT,
you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree
to the terms of this EULA, you may not use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.
Software PRODUCT LICENSE
<P>
The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international
copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and
treaties. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed, not sold.

<OL><P><LI>GRANT OF LICENSE. This EULA grants you the following rights:
<P>
<P><PRE>       Use with Microsoft Excel, Project, Word, FoxPro, Microsoft
</PRE>  Access, and/or Office for Windows (individually, "MS Application").
  If you license the SOFTWARE for use in conjunction with one or more
  MS Application(s), the terms and conditions of the end user license
  agreement you received with such MS Application(s) apply to the
  SOFTWARE, except that you have the additional right to make and use
  up to that number of copies of the SOFTWARE equal to the number of
  copies of such MS Application(s) that you have licensed. Note: you
  may make only one copy of the SOFTWARE for each unit of Microsoft
  Office for Windows that you have licensed.
<P>
<P><PRE>       Developing applications using the Visual Basic for
</PRE>  Applications ("VBA") component of MS Applications. In addition to
  the rights set forth in Section 1(a) above, Microsoft grants you
  the nonexclusive, royalty-free right to reproduce and distribute
  the object code version of the SOFTWARE, provided you comply with
  Section 5 herein.
<P>
<P><PRE>       Developing applications using Microsoft Access Developer's
</PRE>  Toolkit, Visual C++, Microsoft FoxPro, or Visual Basic
  (individually, "MS Development Tool").
<P>
<P><PRE>       (i) If you license the SOFTWARE for use in conjunction with an
</PRE>  MS Development Tool, you may make and use up to the number of
  copies of the SOFTWARE equal to the number of copies of MS
  Development Tools that you have licensed. Each copy of the SOFTWARE
  must be used on a single computer. The SOFTWARE is "in use" on a
  computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or
  installed into permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM, or other
  storage device) of that computer. However, installation on a
  network server for the sole purpose of internal distribution to one
  or more other computer(s) shall not constitute "use" for which a
  separate license is required, provided you have a separate license
  for each computer to which the SOFTWARE is distributed. You may
  make an unlimited number of copies (either in hard copy or
  electronic form) of any electronic documents included with the
  SOFTWARE, provided that such copies shall be used for internal
  purposes and are not republished or distributed beyond the user's
  premises. In addition, Microsoft grants you the nonexclusive,
  royalty-free right to reproduce and distribute the object code
  version of the SOFTWARE provided you comply with Section 5 herein,
  and subject to Section 1(c)(ii) herein.
<P>
<P><PRE>       (ii) The following additional restrictions apply if you use
</PRE>  the SOFTWARE other than solely for internal business purposes. (For
  applicable licensing terms for all such uses of the SOFTWARE,
  please contact Microsoft Corporation at (425) 703-4515.) (1) You
<P>
  may commercially distribute the SOFTWARE only in conjunction with
  and as part of your software product to which you have added
  significant and primary functionality and value. (2) Unless your
  software product requires your customer to license Microsoft Office
  for Windows, or a component of it, in order to operate, you may not
  reproduce or use the SOFTWARE for commercial distribution in
  conjunction with a general purpose word processing, spreadsheet, or
  database software product, or an integrated work or product suite
  whose components include a general purpose word processing,
  spreadsheet, or database management software product except for the
  exclusive purpose of importing or exporting data to the various
  formats supported by the SOFTWARE and included in your application
  (e.g., reading data from and writing data to a single data source
  at one time). Note: a product which includes limited word
  processing, spreadsheet, or database components along with other
  components that provide significant and primary value, such as an
  accounting product with limited spreadsheet capability, is not
  considered to be a "general purpose" product.
<P>
</OL>2.DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS.
<P>
<PRE>  Redistribution Requirements. If you redistribute the SOFTWARE, you
  must: (i) distribute the SOFTWARE in object code only in
