<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In version 1.0 of Open Database Connectivity (ODBC), every time an
application calls SQLConnect(), the Driver Manager calls the Driver s
SQLAllocEnv(), SQLAllocConnect(), and SQLConnect() functions in succession.
This means that an ODBC driver can be called to allocate multiple
environments for the same application.
<P>
Since a driver must allocate only one environment per application, it must
be able to distinguish between the first call to SQLAllocEnv from an
application and subsequent calls to SQLAllocEnv()
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Since only one environment should be allocated for an ODBC application by
the driver, even though multiple calls to SQLAllocEnv are made from the
Driver Manager, a driver can use the Windows function GetCurrentTask() to
determine whether an environment has already been allocated for the calling
application (task).
<P>
Typically, a driver can build a list of tasks that currently have the
environments allocated, and on every call to SQLAllocEnv(), the driver can
use this list to determine if the current task has an allocated
environment. If the task is found in this list, the driver can return the
previously allocated environment associated with that task, without having
to allocate a new environment.
<P>
Drivers written to the ODBC version 2.0 specification need not use the
above mechanism because the 2.0 Driver Manager does not call SQLAllocEnv()
in the Driver on every SQLConnect(). Thus, an ODBC 2.0 driver is assured
that its SQLAllocEnv() will be called only once on the first SQLConnect()
from the application. Subsequent SQLConnect() calls in the application to
that driver will not result in SQLAllocEnv() calls into the driver.
