<UL><LI>Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.40
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft ODBC Desktop Drivers should not be called from a Jet-based
application such as Access, Visual Basic bound data controls, Data Access
Objects (DAO) or the Visual C++ DAO classes.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Jet Database Engine stores its native databases in Access
*.mdb file format. If you load Installable ISAM DLL files, Jet can also
work directly with dBASE, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft FoxPro, Paradox, and
Text files. This means that the three Microsoft products which have been
developed using the Jet Database Engine have native access to all of these
file types. In addition to working directly with these file types, Jet can
work against any data source which provides an ODBC driver. This is called
attaching an external ODBC data source or table.
<P>
The first Microsoft product developed using Jet is Access. All database
work done in Access goes through Access's instance of Jet, either against
its native *.mdb files or the other file types it can access directly using
Installable ISAM's. The second product developed using Jet is the Data
Access Objects (DAO) implemented in both Visual Basic and the Visual C++
DAO classes. DAO can also work natively against Access *.mdb files and the
files accessed through the Installable ISAM's. Both Access and DAO can
also work against any ODBC driver to work with file types or databases not
covered by Jet's Installable ISAM's. The third Microsoft product group
developed using the Jet engine is the Microsoft Desktop Drivers for
Microsoft Access, dBASE, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft FoxPro, Text, and
Paradox. The Desktop Drivers are different than Access and DAO in that each
driver loads a specific Installable ISAM DLL file; therefore, they are
limited to working with the file type covered by that Installable ISAM.
<P>
When an Access or DAO application is run, it starts an instance of the Jet
engine for the application process.  If this application then attempted to
connect to an ODBC Desktop Driver, the process would have to load a second
instance of Jet to implement the driver. Jet is not architected in a way
hat will allow two instances of Jet to be run for a single process, so this
results in various errors. Applications using Access or DAO must use their
native mechanisms to work with .mdb files or the files accessed through
Installable ISAM’s.  The Desktop Drivers are provided for use from
applications utilizing API’s not based on the Jet engine.  Examples where
the Desktop Drivers can be used would be Visual Basic Remote Data Objects
(RDO), Visual C++ MFC Database Classes, or applications written directly to
the ODBC API.
<P>
Jet-based applications cannot use the Desktop Drivers even with
SQL_PASSTHROUGH. SQL_PASSTHROUGH is an option which Access or DAO
programmers can use to instruct Jet not to process a SQL command and simply
pass it directly to an attached ODBC driver. The Access or DAO application
must load its instance of Jet however, and this may cause problems for the
Jet instance of a Desktop Driver. Visual Basic or Visual C++ applications
cannot have any DAO code at all if they are going to work with Desktop
Drivers.  In one support case, a Visual Basic application was converted
from DAO to the ODBC API, but it was still getting errors when it attempted
to use the Access ODBC driver. The cause was found to be that one DAO line,
a dim database, had been left in the application.  Even though this dim
database was never actively referenced in the code, it was sufficient to
load a DAO instance of Jet that caused problems for the Access driver’s
instance of Jet.  The application worked correctly when the dim database
was removed.
<P>
Not all Microsoft drivers are implemented using the Jet Database Engine,
and these issues do not apply to them. Examples are the Microsoft SQL
Server and Visual Foxpro ODBC drivers. Users can find out if a driver
is based on Jet using the ODBC Administrator. In the ODBC Administrator,
click Drivers. In the list of drivers, double-click the driver in question.
If the driver’s file name is ODBCJT32.DLL or ODBCJT16.DLL, it is a Jet-
based driver. If the file name is something else, it is not a Jet-based
driver and is not affected by the issues discussed in this article.
