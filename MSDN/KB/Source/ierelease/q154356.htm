The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to view a Web page in Internet Explorer 3.0, you may receive
the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Content Advisor

   Sorry! Content Advisor will not allow you to see this site.
   This page may contain some or all of the following:
   RSACi: Language - Level 4:   Explicit or crude language

</PRE>NOTE: The last line in the message lists any offensive content.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Ratings system has been enabled, or the Ratings system is set to
require a supervisor's password for a page that does not have a rating.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use any of the following methods. To access
the options listed in these methods, click Options on the View menu, and
then click Advanced:

<UL><LI>Turn off the Ratings system by clicking Disable Ratings and typing your
   password.

<LI>Adjust the level of the label for the rating in question by clicking
   Settings and then choosing the appropriate level.
<P>
   You can also adjust the level that Internet Explorer allows you to
   see. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      RSACi: Nudity - Level 4: Provocative frontal nudity
      RSACi: Sex - Level 3: Non-explicit sexual touching
      RSACi: Language - Level 4: Explicit or crude language
</PRE><P>
   This means you would need to set the level for Nudity to 4, Sex to 3,
   and Language to 4 in order to view this page if the Ratings system is
   enabled.

<LI>Enable the "Users can see sites which have no ratings" option on the
   General tab.
<P>
   Leaving this option disabled means that if a page does not have a
   rating, you will not be able to view it without the supervisor pass-
   word. The "Supervisors can type a password to allow users to view
   restricted content" option is used to allow the supervisor to type his
   or her password when a page is accessed that either has a rating higher
   than Internet Explorer is set to allow or has no rating at all and the
   option to view non-rated pages is not set.
<P>
   If you want to never be prompted for a non-rated page, enable the
   "Users can see sites which have no ratings" option.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: You need the supervisor password in order to disable or modify the
Ratings system.
<P>
If you disable the Ratings system, Internet Explorer does not look for the
tag that specifies the ratings.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) is a World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) standard for content labeling. PICS is essentially a
language for creating a ratings system. Each bit of rating information is
called a label. Internet Explorer supports obtaining label information from
the following locations:

<UL><LI>Within the HTML document as a special HTML tag.
<LI>Within the HTTP headers (the server must put them there).
<LI>From an independent Web server equipped to distribute them.
<P>
</UL>Web document authors are not required to apply any rating method to Web
pages. Internet Explorer uses the RASCi.rat file to obtain the rating for
the contents of the page. "RASC" is the acronym for Recreational Software
Advisory Council.
<P>
If you choose to use a different ratings system, you need to copy the .rat
file to your hard disk and add it to the Internet Explorer ratings list. To
do so, click Options on the View menu, click the Security tab, click
Settings, type the supervisor password, click the Advanced tab, and click
Ratings Systems for a list of currently installed ratings systems.
<P>
Internet Explorer installs the RASCi.rat file in the Windows\System folder.
Click Add to open the folder in which the new ratings system file is
located. Click the new file and click Open.
<P>
For a list of how RASCi.rat views the individual labels, click Options on
the View menu, click the Security tab, click Settings, click the Ratings
tab, and then click More Info.
