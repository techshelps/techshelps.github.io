Microsoft Outlook Express 4.0 for Macintosh
<P>
 
Welcome
 
Thank you for downloading Microsoft Outlook Express 4.0 for Macintosh.
<P>
Microsoft Outlook Express 4.0 for Macintosh will replace Microsoft
Internet Mail and News as the premier mail and news client for Macintosh.

Microsoft Outlook Express enables you to communicate with others on the
Internet or corporate Intranet through electronic mail and newsgroups.

<UL><LI>Electronic mail, or e-mail, lets you exchange messages and files with
   other people on the Internet.

<LI>Internet newsgroups consist of messages by individuals, organized by
   topic. You can take part by posting a message of your own, responding
   to a message and sending it to the whole newsgroup, or sending an e-
   mail message directly to the author of a message.
<P>
</UL> 
Requirements

<LI>System 7.1 and above
<LI>3,600K of available RAM
<LI>6.7 MB of hard disk space to install.
<LI>1 MB of hard disk space to run, depending on the amount of e-mail you
   receive.

(ISP) or the network to which your computer is connected.
<P>
Internet Software

   with TCP/IP (control panel)
<LI>If you are a dial-up user, Config PPP or similar PPP connection

<P>
</UL> 
New and Improved Features
 
Standards Support
<UL><LI>Enhanced support for SMTP, POP3, and NNTP makes it even easier to
   communicate over e-mail.
<LI>Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP4) support allows you to store mail
   messages on a server so you can access them from different locations.
<LI>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server support lets you
   find people on the Internet or Intranet by accessing directory services
   such as Four11, Bigfoot, or a company's internal directory.
<LI>Support for HTML mail and MHTML allows you to read e-mail with HTML
   pages that have embedded images.
<LI>Outlook Express has rich international features including Unicode
   support.
<LI>Support for scripting following Apple's Mail Suite. Compiled scripts
   that are saved in the Script Menu Items folder are displayed in a
   script menu in the program. Outlook Express also supports Frontier's
   menu sharing protocol.
<P>
</UL>Contact and Information Management Features
<UL><LI>The Contacts feature provides you an extended address book in which you
   can maintain extensive contact information.
<LI>You can easily group your contacts into mailing lists.
<LI>Inbox and Newsgroup rules allow you to filter and automate tasks for
   incoming messages.
<LI>Import messages and address book entries from Netscape Navigator 2.0
   and 3.0, Eudora 3.0, and Netscape Communicator 4.0.
<P>
</UL>Simple, Integrated Interface:

   mail folders, contacts, news servers, LDAP servers, and multiple e-mail
   accounts, all in the same easy-access window.
<LI>You can send and receive mail from all your mail accounts at once, or
   you can select individual accounts to send and receive mail.
<LI>A Drafts folder lets you keep track of the messages you create and
   aren't ready to send.
<LI>You can display images within messages (you must have QuickTime 2.5, or
   newer, installed to take advantage of this feature).
<P>
</UL> 
Extra Value with Office 98
 
<UL><LI>With Office 98 installed, you can easily spell check your e-mail.
<LI>You can choose to spell check messages when you send them, or check
   spelling right as you type.
<LI>The Mail Merge feature in Word 98 lets you address letters and
   envelopes using your Outlook Express contacts.
<LI>The Office 98 programs make it easy to e-mail documents with Outlook
   Express by allowing you to click Send To from within any Office 98
   program.
<P>
</UL> 
<P><h3>Security Issues</h3>
 
Outlook Express has several features that make it easier to keep your
communications private. These features are intended to prevent other
people from accessing your mail through normal use of Outlook Express.
They are not designed to prevent malicious people from using alternate
tactics to gain access to your private information. Below are some tips on
using the security features in Outlook Express.
<UL><LI>If other people have access to your computer and you are concerned
   about security, do not choose the Save Password option when creating e-
   mail accounts. This is especially important if you are using the
   multiple user feature.
<LI>If you do not want other users to access the mail in your local
   folders, choose the Require Password option in the Startup Settings
   section of the Startup &amp; Quit panel in Preferences. Note that this will
   not prevent other users from using another program to directly access
   the mail files stored on your disk.
<LI>Some security options, including SSL, require support from the server
   that you are connecting to. If you are having trouble with these
   features, please contact your server administrator.
<P>
</UL> 
Known Limitations
 
Upgrading from Internet Mail and News
To import messages and addresses from Internet Mail and News, you must
have Internet Mail and News 3.0 or later.
<P>
Outlook Express does not import filters or newsgroup favorites from
Internet Mail and News. After upgrading, you will have to subscribe to
your favorite newsgroups again and set up Inbox Rules and Newsgroup Rules
to replace your IMN filters.
<P>
International
Outlook Express does not support right to left languages.
<P>
Extended characters are not permitted in server passwords because of
potential character set conflicts between different operating systems.
<P>
Inbox rules
Inbox rules do not work with IMAP or online POP mail accounts.
<P>
Internet Config (IC) Preferences
When you start Outlook Express for the first time, it will check for
Internet Config settings. If you have IC settings, OE will prompt you to
verify those settings, but will only display the New Account dialog box.
When this occurs, you should type the name of your Internet Config mail
account in the Account Name box, and click OK.
<P>
 
Technical Support
 
Microsoft offers technical support and services ranging from self-help
tools to direct assistance with a Microsoft technical engineer. For more
information on options in your area, read Support.txt located in the Help
folder (inside the Outlook Express folder).
<P>
 
Reporting Problems/Suggestions
 
To report problems, send mail to msmacoe@microsoft.com.
<P>
Please include:
<UL><LI>The version of Outlook Express you are using
<LI>What version you upgraded from
<LI>System configuration information
<LI>Version of operating system
<LI>Type of Macintosh
<LI>Type of connection to the Internet
<LI>Steps that lead to the bug. For example:
   1. Start Outlook Express.
   2. From the File menu, choose Open.
   3. Click the Cancel button.
