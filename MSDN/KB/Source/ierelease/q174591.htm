The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0, 4.01 for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Internet Explorer, the System.1st file in the root
folder of the boot drive may not be updated.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur in either of the following situations:

<UL><LI>The original System.1st file is not present during the installation of
   Internet Explorer.

<LI>Your computer is low on disk space. The creation of the new System.1st
   file is skipped to ensure the successful installation of Internet
   Explorer.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, copy the System.dat file to the System.1st file.
To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

<P><LI>Change to the Windows folder by typing the following line and then
   pressing ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd\&lt;windir&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;windir&gt; is the folder in which Windows is installed.

<P><LI>Type the following lines, pressing ENTER after each line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      attrib -s -h -r system.dat
      attrib -s -h -r c:\system.1st
      copy system.dat c:\system.1st
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If you are prompted to overwrite a file, choose Yes.

<P><LI>Type "exit" (without quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Shut down and restart your computer.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The System.1st file is not used in normal Windows usage. It is intended
for use by support professionals as a known good registry file. There is
no problem running Internet Explorer with an outdated System.1st file or
no System.1st file.
<P>
To verify that the System.1st file was updated with Internet Explorer
settings before using it to replace the registry, check the "Integrated
Browser.ini" file. If the System.1st file was updated, it is listed in
this file (usually the second entry).
<P>
If the Windows Desktop Update component is installed, the registry is
backed up. The old desktop files are backed up to the "Integrated
Browser.dat" file and the corresponding "Integrated Browser.ini" file is
created. Additionally, the original System.1st file is also backed up and
stored in the "Integrated Browser.dat" file. A command that copies the
System.dat file to the System.1st file is added to the RunOnce key in the
registry. The System.dat file is copied to  the System.1st file the next
time the computer is restarted or the RunOnce key is processed. The
validity of the System.1st file is not checked.
