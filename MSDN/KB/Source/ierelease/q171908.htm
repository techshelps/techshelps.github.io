The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook Express version 4.0 for Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Outlook Express version 4.0 for Windows NT 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you receive a mail or news message sent with Outlook Express, images
in the message may not be displayed. The image may appear as a box with a
red X.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if the linked image file is not located in a
publicly available location. The file is not on a Web server or shared
network drive, or the file is located on a publicly available location but
you are working offline.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, the sender should use the Send Pictures With
Message option to attach the image to the message, or copy the image to a
shared location and specify that location in the properties for the image.
To do this, use the appropriate method:
<P>
<P><h3>To Attach an Image to a Message</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Outlook Express, click Options on the Tools menu.

<P><LI>On the Send tab, click HTML under Mail Sending Format.

<P><LI>To enable sending images as attachments in every message, click
   Settings, click the Send Pictures With Messages check box to select
   it, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Under News Sending Format, click HTML.

<P><LI>Click Settings, click the Send Pictures With Messages check box to
   select it, and then click OK until all dialog boxes are closed.

<P><LI>Click Compose Message, and then click the message text box.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Picture.

<P><LI>In the Image Source box, browse to or type the path to the image, and
   then click OK.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, make sure that there is a check mark next to Send
   Pictures With Message. If there is no check mark, click Send Pictures
   With Message.
<P>
   NOTE: You must perform this step each time you want to send pictures
   with your newsgroup message.

<P><LI>Finish your message, and then click Send Message on the File menu.
<P>
</OL><h3>To Place an Image in a Shared Location</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Copy the image file to a publicly available location such as a Web
   server (for the Internet) or a shared network folder (for an intranet).
   Recipients of the message should have at least read access privileges
   to the shared location.

<P><LI>If you are inserting a new image in a message, click Picture on the
   Insert menu. If you are modifying an image that is already inserted in
   the message, right-click the image, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>In the Image Source box, browse to or type the Web address of the
   image. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Internet example: <B><A HREF="http://example.microsoft.com/MyImage.gif">http://example.microsoft.com/MyImage.gif</A></B>
      intranet example: file://\\MyServer\MyShare\MyImage.gif
</PRE><P>
   For information about Universal Naming Convention (UNC) support in
   Web addresses, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../IE_APP/Q135983.htm">Q135983</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : UNC FILE: URL Formats Supported by Internet Explorer

</PRE><P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the option to send pictures with messages is not selected, the
message contains a reference pointer (or link) to the image. The image
source points to the location of the image and is equivalent to the
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) &lt;IMG SRC=""&gt; tag. Because the image is
not included in the message, the message size is smaller and download time
is reduced. Also, the image can be updated at the public or shared
location without having to send another message.
<P>
If the link is to image files residing on the sending computer's hard
disk, mail and newsgroup recipients may not have access to the image. If
the person receiving the message does not have the file in the same folder
on his or her local hard disk, he or she does not see the image file.
<P>
NOTE: With default stationery selections, the recipient may or may not
have the intended image in the same location on the local hard disk as the
sender. If the image points to a valid local file, the image appears as
though it was attached even though it was inserted from a local file on
the sender's computer when the message was created.
