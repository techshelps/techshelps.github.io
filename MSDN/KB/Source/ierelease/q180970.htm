The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Macintosh
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a copy of the information in the Release Notes file
included with Microsoft Virtual Machine for Java for Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Virtual Machine for Java for Macintosh
<P>
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 Java support is based on the JManager
interface as defined by Apple Computer, Inc. Internet Explorer has an open
architecture that supports multiple Java Virtual Machines such as the
Apple MRJ and the Microsoft Virtual Machine.
<P>
The Microsoft Virtual Machine
<P>
The Microsoft Java VM supports 68000 and PowerPC machines. The VM also
includes a PowerPC JIT (Just-in-time compiler) for faster Java operation.
<P>
The Microsoft VM is installed when you install IE with Java. The default
Java setting for IE is with the JIT turned off. This setting runs in a
lower memory space. If you have more memory and would like to run faster
you can choose to turn on the JIT. The JIT takes standard Java byte codes
and turns them into native PowerPC instructions. For computational
applets, you will see a dramatic increase in speed. The speed of graphics
operations, however, will be largely unaffected. Running applets with the
JIT enabled requires more RAM than the standard configuration.
<P>
New Features since 3.01:

<UL><LI>Inclusion of Microsoft's Application Foundation Classes (AFC)
   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/java/afc/">http://www.microsoft.com/java/afc/</A></B>
<LI>Support for the JDK 1.1.4 specification
<LI>Decoding of Java applets in Cabinet (CAB) archives. CAB is Microsoft's
   technology for quickly and securely sending Java classes over the
   Internet. For more information on CAB technology go to
   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/prog/cab">http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/prog/cab</A></B>
<LI>Support for security zones for the Microsoft Virtual Machine
<P>
<P>
</UL>Known Issues with the Microsoft VM
<P>
Choosing a new VM
You must restart Internet Explorer when you choose a new Virtual Machine
in the Java preferences panel.
<P>
International character support for Microsoft Java VM
If you experience problems viewing international characters in Java
applets, make sure that the Apple Text Encoding Converter is installed on
your computer. To do so, check your Text Encoding folder in your System
folder.  You can also look for the Text Encoding Converter file in your
Extensions folder (located in your System folder).  The Apple Text
Encoding Converter version 1.1 has been shipping with the Mac OS since
version 7.6. The latest version as of the shipping of this product is
1.3.1.  For more information, visit <B>http://macos.apple.com.</B>
<P>
Native Method Support
This version of the Microsoft VM supports "classic" - JDK 1.0.2 - native
method invocation only.
<P>
Low Memory Issues
In some cases there may be no warning that a Java applet was unable to
load because of low memory availability. Quitting Internet Explorer,
choosing Get Info on the Application, and increasing the memory partition
for IE may alleviate this problem.
<P>
Navigating While Loading an Applet
Pressing the Refresh, Back, or Forward buttons many times repeatedly while
some Java applets are actively loading, may cause Internet Explorer to
stop working properly.
<P>
Clipboard support
Using the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands in a Java applet only works by
using the command keys.
<P>
Printing
Printing of Applets is currently not supported in this version of the
Microsoft Virtual Machine for Java for Macintosh.
<P>
<P>
The Apple MRJ
<P>
To use this Apple Virtual Machine, you must first download and install it
from <B>http://applejava.apple.com.</B>
