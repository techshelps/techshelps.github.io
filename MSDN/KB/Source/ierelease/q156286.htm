The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.0, 4.0 for Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 for Windows NT 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to play a video movie file with ActiveMovie, you may
experience problems hearing audio, seeing video, or both. You may also
receive one of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>When you try to play a movie that contains audio and video that are
   both in unsupported formats, the following error message appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot play back the video stream: no suitable decompressor could
      be found.
</PRE><P>
   The only option is to click OK. ActiveMovie then quits.

<LI>If ActiveMovie can play at least one of the streams (either audio or
   video), you do not receive an error message, but may see the word
   "Warning" next to the time index within the ActiveMovie window. Moving
   the mouse pointer over the word "Warning" displays the warning message
   in the form of a Windows tooltip. Some of these warning messages are
   listed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Some of the streams in this movie are in an unsupported format.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot play back the video stream: no suitable decompressor could
      be found.
</PRE><P>
   These messages are shown only as warnings. The most common symptoms
   are either the lack of video while playing a video using ActiveMovie
   or the lack of audio while playing a movie (because either the video
   or audio is in an unsupported format for playback with ActiveMovie).
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Cannot play back the video stream: no suitable decompressor could be
   found:
<P>
   This message most commonly occurs with files with a .mov extension
   which were originally created on an Apple Macintosh computer. The Apple
   Macintosh has video and audio codecs (Compression/Decompression
   schemes) that are not supported by ActiveMovie.

<LI>Some of the streams in this movie are in an unsupported format:
<P>
   This warning typically occurs when the audio stream is not supported
   within ActiveMovie. The most common symptom is the lack of audio while
   playing back a video using ActiveMovie

<LI>Cannot play back the video stream: no suitable decompressor could be
   found:
<P>
   This message is similar to the first message noted above. However, you
   do not receive it as an error message in a message box.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To properly view these files, a third-party viewer that supports the video
and audio streams used in the playback file must be used.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The most common video streams that are not supported by ActiveMovie are
RPZA (Apple Video Compressor) and JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group). 
A third-party movie viewer such as the 32-bit QuickTime for Windows movie 
viewer version 2.1.1.57 or later may be able to view these files.
<P>
The most common audio stream that is not supported by ActiveMovie is IMA4 
(Interactive Multimedia Association). A third-party movie viewer may be 
able to play these files.
<P>
The third-party products discussed in this article are manufactured by
vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
