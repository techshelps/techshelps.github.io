The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0, 4.0 for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Digital Code Signing is a standard used to help ensure that content and
files you download from the Internet have come from trusted sources and
have not been altered since their creation. This also provides additional
protection against computer viruses.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Digital Code Signing can be used for downloadable files and ActiveX Web
page content.
<P>
When a file or an ActiveX page is downloaded, a check is performed to
determine if the file or content was signed by the publisher and whether
or not the certificate used to sign the code is valid. You are prompted
to continue downloading the file based on the information that is
displayed.
<P>
<P><h3>Internet Explorer 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
Internet Explorer 4.0 has four security settings:
<P>
<PRE>   High     Warns you if the file or contents fail to pass the security
            check, and does not accept the contents or file. You are not
            given the option to accept the incoming content.

   Medium   Provides warnings about possible violations and allows you
            to choose whether to accept or reject the incoming file or
            content.

   None     You are not warned of possible security violations.
