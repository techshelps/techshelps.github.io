<OL><P><LI>Verify your modem connections. To do so, follow these steps:
<P>
</OL>a. Verify that your cables are in good working condition, and connected 
<PRE>   properly. If you are using an internal or external modem, verify that

   in the wall.

c. Verify that your phone cable is functional by trying it with your 
<PRE>   telephone or replacing it with a cable that you know works.

</PRE>d. Click Redial.

<OL><P><LI>Listen for a dial tone. If you do not hear a dial tone, your 
   organization or telephone might not support this type of outside call,
   or might require an additional access code.

<P><LI>Contact your telephone company or phone system administrator or your 
   local telephone company to verify your service and proper setup.
<P>

   access number to access the Internet, if one is available.

   minutes.

<PRE>   free number you can use to sign up for Internet access. If not, you may
   need to make a long-distance call. After you have finished establishing
   a new account, your Internet service provider will give you a local 
   access number to access the Internet, if one is available.

</PRE></OL>c. Click OK, and then click Redial.
<P>
d. If there is only one phone number listed for your area, there may be a 
<PRE>   temporary problem with that location. Click OK, and then click Redial. 
   If this does not resolve the issue, try again after waiting several 
   minutes.

</PRE><P><LI>If you hear a message that does not refer to dialing long-distance, the
   network or the server you are trying to connect to might be unavailable
   due to updates or repairs. Wait a while and then run the ICW again.

<P><LI>Try to determine the nature of the message coming from the operator. 
   This may help you to understand the issue you are experiencing. If 
   necessary, you may want to contact your local phone company.
