   TITLE     : Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 Available

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>MK Overrun Issue</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft has posted a fix to protect Internet Explorer customers against
a potential problem known as the MK Overrun issue. This issue can cause
Internet Explorer 4.0 or 4.01 to stop responding (hang) when a malicious
Web site uses a "mk://" Web address that contains more characters than
Internet Explorer supports. These extra characters could form a malicious
executable file that could be run on your computer.
<P>
This issue was originally reported on the following Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B>http://l0pht.com/advisories.html.</B>

</PRE>This issue affects customers who use the following products:

<UL><LI>Internet Explorer 4.0 and 4.01 for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0
<LI>Internet Explorer 3.02 for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 with
   Microsoft Visual Studio installed.
<P>
</UL>There have not been any reports of customers being affected by this bug.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft Windows 3.1, Microsoft Windows NT 3.5, Macintosh, and Unix
versions of Internet Explorer are not affected by this issue. The patches
will eventually be available in several languages.
<P>
For additional information (or to download the patch), please see the
following Microsoft Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/security/?/ie/security/mk.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/security/?/ie/security/mk.htm</A></B>

</PRE>The MK Overrun patch updates the Urlmon.dll file in the Windows\System or
Winnt/System32 folder to the following size, date, and version:
<P>
<PRE>   Browser Platform   Size (in bytes)   Date      Version
   ----------------------------------------------------------

   Windows 95         483,600           1/15/98   4.72.2915.0
   Windows NT 4.0     484,112           1/15/98   4.72.2915.0

</PRE>To uninstall this patch, extract the original Urlmon.dll file from the
Internet Explorer 4.0 or 4.01 Ie4_s3.cab cabinet file.
<P>
<P><h3>Page Redirect Issue</h3>
 
<P>
When you connect to a Web site that requires user authentication
information (name and password), and the Web site redirects you to another
Web site, your authentication information may be captured by the second
Web site.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft has received no reports of any Internet Explorer user
being affected by this problem to date.
<P>
Internet Explorer 3.02 users should download the Redir302.exe patch.
Internet Explorer 4.0 users should download the Redir40.exe patch.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Explorer versions
3.02 and 4.0 for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, and has provided a patch
that fixes the problem.
<P>
NOTE: The Page Redirect issue does not affect Internet Explorer for
Windows 3.1, Windows NT 3.51, or Macintosh. It does affect Platform
Preview 1 of Internet Explorer 4.0 for UNIX on Sun Solaris. Note that
Microsoft recommends using preview versions for evaluation purposes only
and will fix this issue in the final version of Internet Explorer 4.0 for
UNIX on Sun Solaris. In the meantime, we recommend that Platform Preview 1
of Internet Explorer 4.0 for UNIX on Sun Solaris users do not enter their
authentication information at Web sites.
<P>
When you install this patch, the Wininet.dll file in the Windows\System
folder (in Windows 95) or Winnt\System32 folder (in Windows NT) is updated
as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Browser                  Version       Size      Date
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   Internet Explorer 3.02   4.70.1323     300,816   11/03/97 11:32a
   Internet Explorer 4.0    4.71.2113.0   368,400   11/14/97 11:19a

</PRE><h3>Buffer Overrun Issue</h3>
 
<P>
A malicious Web page author could create a Web page with a link containing
the "res://" URL type using more characters than the "res://" URL type was
designed to support (256 characters). When you navigate to such a link,
the characters beyond the first 256 could contain malicious code that
could be executed on your computer.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Explorer version
4.0 for Windows 95, and has provided a patch that fixes the problem. Note
that this problem does not affect Windows NT, Windows 3.1, or Macintosh
users of Internet Explorer 4.0, or any other versions of Internet
Explorer.
<P>
When you install this patch, the Mshtml.dll file is updated to version
4.71.2110.0 (2,408,208 bytes, last modified on 11/10/97) on Windows 95
only.
<P>
<P><h3>"Freiburg" Text-Viewing Issue</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft has released a patch for Internet Explorer 4.0 for Windows 95
and Windows NT 4.0 to protect your computer against a potential problem
with Internet Explorer 4.0 known as the "Freiburg" text-viewing issue.
<P>
NOTE: The Windows 95 version of this patch is no longer available on
Microsoft's Web site. The "Freiburg" patch is included in the Buffer
Overrun patch for Windows 95 only.
<P>
When you install this patch, the Mshtml.dll file is updated to version
4.71.2016.0.
<P>
NOTE: The version number reported when you click About Internet Explorer
on the Help menu (version 4.71.1712.6) and the Internet Explorer 4.0 user
agent string (Mozilla/4.0 [compatible; MSIE4.0;Window 95]) are unchanged
for this patch.
<P>
The potential problem exposed by the "Freiburg" text-viewing issue could
allow a malicious Web site to obtain the contents of a text, Hypertext
Markup Language (HTML), or graphics file from your hard disk. The file
obtained cannot be damaged or manipulated on your computer, but it can be
viewed.
<P>
A malicious person could create a Web page that is intentionally designed
to exploit the "Freiburg" text-viewing issue. The Web page must be
specifically designed to use the exact name and location of a text, HTML,
or graphics file on your hard disk. Even if the exact name and location of
a file is used, the Web site cannot destroy or tamper with any data, and
data cannot be obtained from files other than text, HTML, or graphics
files.
<P>
To protect your computer against this problem, disable scripting for
unfamiliar Web sites by using the security zones feature of Internet
Explorer 4.0. Network administrators can also use security zones to
prevent this problem from occurring on their intranet.
<P>
To disable scripting for unfamiliar Web sites, follow these steps in
Internet Explorer:

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Internet Options, and then click the Security
   tab.

<P><LI>In the Zone box, click Restricted Sites Zone.

<P><LI>Under Restricted Sites Zone, click Custom (For Expert Users), and then
   click Settings.

<P><LI>Under Active Scripting, click disable, and then click OK.

<P><LI>To add a specific Web site to the Restricted Sites Zone, click Add
   Sites.

<P><LI>Type a Web address in the "Add this Web site to the zone" box, and
   then click Add.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then click OK again.
<P>
</OL>For additional information about Internet Explorer 4.0 security zones,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
