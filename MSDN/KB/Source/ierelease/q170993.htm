                  Needed...

</PRE><LI>Setup Was Unable to Download Information About Available Installation

<P>
   This behavior can be caused by either of the following situations:

      Explorer is extremely busy or there is a different behavior with the
      location.
</PRE><P>

</PRE><LI>The Folder '&lt;path&gt;' Is Invalid:
<P>
   For information about this behavior, please see the following article
   in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Error Message: The Folder '&lt;Path&gt;' Is Invalid...

</PRE><LI>Setup Cannot Upgrade the Current Version of Internet Explorer:
<P>
   This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions exist:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - You are installing Internet Explorer 4.01 (Version 4.72.2106.8)
      over Platform Preview 1.0 (Version 4.71.544.) or 2.0 (Version
      4.71.1008).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      To resolve this problem, uninstall the Platform Preview version of
      Internet Explorer 4.0 before you install Internet Explorer 4.01.
      For information about how to do so, please see the following
      articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ierelease/Q166322.htm">Q166322</A></B>
         TITLE     : Uninstalling Internet Explorer 4.0 Platform Preview
                     1.0

         TITLE     : Uninstalling Internet Explorer 4.0 Platform Preview
                     2.0

    - The Active Setup Wizard cannot determine which version of Internet
      Explorer is currently installed on your computer.

      To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods:

       - If you are upgrading to Internet Explorer 4.0 or 4.01 from
         Internet Explorer 3.x and you have never successfully
         installed Internet Explorer 4.0 or 4.01, or Internet Explorer
         4.0 or 4.01 has been uninstalled, reinstall the version of
         Internet Explorer 3.x you are currently running before
         you installing Internet Explorer 4.0 or 4.01.

       - If you are upgrading Internet Explorer 4.0 to 4.01 (or
         reinstalling Internet Explorer 4.0 or 4.01), then check the
         Active Setup Log.txt file for lines that begin with "File
         Version" to determine the cause of the problem.

         NOTE: If any of these files have a version number of 4.71.544.x
         or 4.71.1008.x, rename them before you run Internet Explorer
         4.0 or 4.01 Setup.

         When you install Internet Explorer, it checks the version of
         several files to determine which version of Internet Explorer is
         currently installed on your computer. If Internet Explorer 4.0 or
         4.01 is currently installed, it determines whether the Web
         Integrated Desktop is enabled. The results of this version check
         are added to the Active Setup log.txt file.

</PRE><LI>There Is Not Enough Disk Space to Install Internet Explorer 4.0 Using
   the Installation Option You Selected:
<P>
   This behavior can occur when you install Internet Explorer on a drive
   other than the drive on which Windows is installed and the drive
   contains less than 50 MB of free disk space.
<P>
   To work around this behavior, increase the amount of free space on the
   drive on which you are installing Internet Explorer and then attempt to
   install Internet Explorer again.

<LI>Error Initializing the Cache:
<P>
   This behavior can occur if you are using Windows NT and you disabled
   long file name support for partitions using the FAT file system.
<P>
   To work around this behavior, enable long file name support for
   partitions using the FAT file system and then attempt to install
   Internet Explorer again. For information about how to do this, view the
   online Help topic long filenames.

<LI>Only the desktop wallpaper appears when you restart your computer:
<P>
   For information about how to work around this problem, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
