<P><h2>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</h2>
 
<P>
To run the released version of Internet Explorer 4.0 for UNIX, your system
must meet the following minimum requirements:
<P>
<PRE> * A Sparcstation 2 or greater
 * English Solaris 2.5 and above
 * 32 MB of RAM (64 MB recommended)
 * 65 MB of hard-disk space to perform the installation

</PRE> 
<P><h2>SETUP</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Downloading Internet Explorer 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
You can download the file ie4setup from the following FTP site:
<P>
<PRE>   ftp.microsoft.com/deskapps/ie/unix/sol

</PRE>The product is also available at the following HTTP site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/unix/">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/unix/</A></B>

</PRE>The file ie4setup is a self-extracting executable that contains all the
files you will need. If you ftp this file, be sure to use binary transfer
mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Internet Explorer 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
Installing to the default directory, /usr/local/microsoft, may require
root access.
<P>
1) If you had the Preview 1 version installed previously you must remove
<PRE>   the current installation directory, for example 'rm -r
   /usr/local/microsoft'.
</PRE>2) Change directory to where you downloaded the file ie4setup; 'cd
<PRE>   &lt;download directory&gt;'.
</PRE>3) Make the downloaded file executable; 'chmod +x ie4setup'.
4) Run the executable; './ie4setup'.
5) When Setup prompts you for an installation directory, you can accept
<PRE>   the default directory or type in a new directory path.

</PRE>To run Internet Explorer 4.0:
<P>
<PRE>   After Internet Explorer 4.0 is installed, you can start the browser by
   running "&lt;installation directory&gt;/bin/iexplorer".

</PRE>Uninstalling Internet Explorer 4.0
 
<P>
You must remove the current installation directory, for example,
<PRE>'rm -r /usr/local/microsoft'.

</PRE>If you implemented CDE integration as explained below, you should remove
it by deleting the "IE4.dt" file from the system or user directory.
<P>
 
<P><h2>COMMON DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT INTEGRATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you run Internet Explorer within a CDE session, it will adopt the CDE
color scheme unless overridden with explicit color settings.
<P>
If you install Internet Explorer on Solaris 2.6, you will be asked whether
you wish to install CDE integration. If you answer yes, a file called
"IE4.dt" will be added to the system. If you are user "root", the file is
added to the directory /etc/dt/appconfig/types/C, and will affect all
users on the system. Otherwise, the file will be added to the directory
~/.dt/types, and will affect only you.
<P>
The file "IE4.dt" is in the "ie4" subdirectory of the installation, and
can be copied to other users' ~/.dt/types directory. If you use CDE
integration, then the generic web browser icon will launch Internet
Explorer, and the default action for an HTML file will be to launch
Internet Explorer and open the file.
<P>
CDE integration can be removed by simply deleting the "IE4.dt" file from
the system or user directories.
<P>
There is a set of Internet Explorer icons for use with CDE, in the
ie4/ie4icons subdirectory of the installation. They can be used by
administrators who want to place the Internet Explorer logo on the
desktop.
<P>
 
<P><h2>USER AGENT</h2>
 
<P>
The User Agent String for Internet Explorer is static except for the third
field which depends on the Operating System and the processor you are
using.
<P>
Here are some common configurations and the user agent strings generated
by Internet Explorer on these platforms:
<P>
<PRE>   Sparc 5, Solaris 2.5.1:
      Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; SunOS 5.5.1 sun4m; X11)

   Any Ultra, Solaris 2.5.1:
      Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; SunOS 5.5.1 sun4u; X11)

   Any Ultra, Solaris 2.6:
      Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; SunOS 5.6 sun4u; X11)

</PRE> 
AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ORGANIZE FAVORITES
 
<P>
In addition to being able to organize favorites through the Organize
Favorites item on the Favorites menu, you can also manipulate your
favorites through the file system. Your favorites are organized and
maintained in the directory, ~/.microsoft/Favorites. You should shut down
Internet Explorer to make changes to this directory. The changes you make
will be reflected in your Favorites menu when you restart Internet
Explorer.
<P>
 
<P><h2>KNOWN ISSUES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Solaris Compatibility</h3>
 
<P>
Internet Explorer is not supported on Solaris 2.4 and below.
<P>
To run Internet Explorer on Solaris 2.5 a patch is required. Use of any or
all of these patches is subject to any license terms that may accompany
the patch. Patch 103093-17 corrects a multithreading issue.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE:  Additional patches from Sun Microsystems, Inc., may be necessary
   to get full functionality from this patch.  See the patch's README for
   more details.

   A link to download this patch is available from the following page:
      <B>http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/us/pubpatchpage.pl</B>

   If that link doesn't work, try the FREE PATCHES link off of:
      <B>http://sunsolve.sun.com/sunsolve/</B>

   You can download either the patch itself at:
      <B>ftp://sunsolve.sun.com/pub/patches/103093-17.tar.Z</B>

   There is also a cluster of recommended patches that will install in a
   single step which includes 103093-17:
      <B>ftp://sunsolve.sun.com/pub/patches/2.5_Recommended.tar.Z</B>

</PRE>Note that this patch number may become 103093-18 or higher in the future
as Sun Microsystems, Inc., upgrades it.
<P>
If you install Internet Explorer on a host machine, and use NFS to mount
the installation on another machine using a different pathname, then you
will not be able to execute Internet Explorer on the second machine.
Similarly, if you move the installation directory to a different pathname,
you will not be able to execute Internet Explorer. In both cases you will
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>  Support for SunOS 2.6 has not been installed on this system.

  The message may read "SunOS 2.5" or "SunOS 2.5.1" as appropriate.

  To fix the NFS problem:
  - Make a copy of &lt;installation directory&gt;/bin/iexplorer on the second
    machine, in local disk storage. For example, /usr/local/bin/iexplorer
    may be an appropriate filename if you are "root".
  - Edit the copy (it's a shell script) and change line 3 to reflect the
    full pathname of the mount point. For example, if you mounted the
    installation directory under the name /net/myhost/local/ms, then line
    3 will read:
      MSFT_HOME=/net/myhost/local/ms/
    (note the trailing '/' character).
  - Make sure the edited copy has execute permission.
  - Make sure that users on that machine always use the edited copy.

  To fix the "moved directory" problem, simply edit the file bin/iexplorer
  As described above.

  You may use alternative approaches, so long as the shell variable
  MSFT_HOME gets the appropriate value.

</PRE><h3>Internet Explorer User Interface Issues</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE> o Experienced users of X11 can set color preferences using X resources
   with the  class name "Iexplorer".

 o When highlighting text in the browser window, Internet Explorer will
   automatically highlight whole words, unless the cursor is backed up
   over a  word, in which case single character units can be highlighted.

 o If you have more than one invocation of Internet Explorer running and
   one of  the browser windows has a modal dialog open, the menu bars on
   all other  Internet Explorer windows are disabled.

 o When not running within a CDE session, Internet Explorer obtains its
   color  specifications using standard X mechanisms with fallback values
   obtained from  the file &lt;installation directory&gt;/ie4/Iexplorer. This is
   an X resource file  and contains instructions that will help the system
   administrator or  individual user perform limited color and font
   customization. Note: You may  use the command line options to set the
   foreground and background colors -  for example, "iexplorer -bg black
   -fg white" would be useful on a monochrome  display.

</PRE><h3>Miscellaneous Issues</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE> o If you delete the directory TempInternetFiles while the browser is
   running,  the browser may hang.

 o HTML pages that omit file extensions for image references are not
   rendered  correctly.

 o The ability to determine how much temporary file space the browser is
   allowed  to use is not working in this version of the product. It can
   not be changed  from its default setting of 1% of the total drive
   space. You can, however,  set the cache to clear on every exit of the
   browser so that no space is  reserved for caching Internet Files
   between browser sessions.

 o Renaming a "Favorites" folder with a name that has more than the
   leading  letter capitalized will result in the name being unchangeable
   through the  browser. Although it can still be changed as described in
   the "AN ALTERNATIVE  WAY TO ORGANIZE FAVORITES" section above.

 o Internet Explorer may leave files in a temporary directory (/var/tmp).
   These  files are not needed and can be safely deleted whenever Internet
   Explorer is  not running.

 o If different people share a common user ID, network authentications
   made by  one person may be available to others who are running
   simultaneous copies of  the browser.

 o Form items and transparent GIFs do not print correctly.

 o Address auto-complete does not always work as expected for addresses
   with  mixed case.

 o In the Mappings tab of the Internet Options Menu, the command line
   field  cannot contain output redirection statements (e.g.: cat
   %1&gt;/dev/audio).

 o In the Programs tab of the Internet Options Menu, the news command or
   script  specified cannot be passed more than one argument.

 o Under some circumstances the mouse pointer may be displayed with a
   black background or completely black.
