<PRE>        selecting the Let Windows Manage My Virtual Memory check
        box.


</PRE></OL><h2>SETUP</h2>
 
<P>
- WARNING: Do not install any previous version of Internet
<PRE>  Explorer over Internet Explorer 4.0. If you need to install
  an earlier version of Internet Explorer, you must uninstall
  Internet Explorer 4.0 first.

</PRE>- You should always uninstall your current version of Internet
<PRE>  Explorer 4.0 before installing a newer build.

</PRE>- It is recommended that you download Internet Explorer 4.0 to a
<PRE>  directory that does not contain any other files and that will not
  be used for any other purpose. If for some reason you want to
  uninstall the setup files by clicking the Add/Remove Programs
  icon and then clicking Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 Setup
  Files, the download directory will be removed.

</PRE>- Before you install Internet Explorer 4.0, you should disable any
<PRE>  scheduled tasks from running that might interfere with the Setup
  process.

</PRE><h3>Installing Internet Explorer 4.0</h3>
 
Whether you choose to install over the network or to download
the installation files to your hard disk, the Setup files are
copied to your hard disk. This is so you can reinstall more
quickly if you need to. If you want to reclaim the disk space,
you can remove the setup directory by double-clicking the Add/Remove
Programs icon in Control Panel and then clicking Internet Explorer
4.0 Setup Files.
<P>
You cannot install Internet Explorer 4.0 to or run it from a
network drive. However, you can download it to a network drive.
To do this, you must map the network drive to a drive letter on
your computer. You cannot download Internet Explorer 4.0 to a
UNC path.
<P>
If Internet Explorer 4.0 appears to stop responding at the end
of Setup, you need to restart your computer manually.
<P>
<P><h3>Running Internet Explorer 4.0 on Windows NT</h3>
 
NOTE: You must have administrative privileges to install and
uninstall this program on Windows NT. This includes having
administrative privileges the first time you start your computer
after installing or uninstalling.
<P>
You must restart your computer after installing Internet Explorer
4.0. This is also true for some add-on components.
<P>
If you're running Internet Explorer 4.0 on Windows NT, you must
set user permissions to Full Control for the Temporary Internet
Files folder (cache). The user must have write permission in order
for files to be stored in the Temporary Internet Files folder.
<P>
If you must reinstall Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) after
you install Internet Explorer 4.0, you must specify when prompted
that you do not want it to overwrite any files that are newer.
After SP3 is reinstalled, carry out the following steps to update
the registry:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, and then click Run.
</OL>2. Type the following: regsvr32 rsabase.dl
3. Click OK.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Internet Explorer 3.02a on Windows NT 3.51</h3>
 
Setup.exe will not run and Internet Explorer Plus will not
work on Windows NT 3.51. The Internet Explorer 3.02a browser,
though, can still be installed by following this procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Run \win31\eng\iesetup.exe from the CD.
</OL>2. Choose Custom setup.
3. Clear the TCP/IP Stack and Dialer check box.
<P>
<P><h3>Running Internet Explorer 4.0 on a Dual-Boot Operating System</h3>
 
If your computer is set up to dual boot between two operating
systems, you must install Internet Explorer 4.0 in separate
directories for each operating system. For example, if you are
running Windows 95 and Windows NT, you might want to install
Internet Explorer 4.0 in C:\IE95 for Windows 95 and in C:\IENT
for Windows NT. Do not try to use the same installation of
Internet Explorer with two operating systems. If you later
uninstall Internet Explorer 4.0, one of your operating systems
may be left unbootable.
<P>
Note also that if you dual boot between two operating systems
that are configured to share a Program Files folder, and you
uninstall an add-on component from one of your Internet Explorer
4.0 installations, it will be removed from both of them. This is
because the add-on files are stored in the Program Files folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Uninstalling Internet Explorer 4.0</h3>
 
You can uninstall Internet Explorer 4.0 by carrying out the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, click the Add/Remove Programs icon.
</OL>2. Click Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, and then click Add/Remove.
3. Follow the instructions on your screen.
<P>
Cannot Use Registry or ERD Files Created Before
<PRE>  Installing Internet Explorer 4.0
</PRE></OL> 
If you install Internet Explorer 4.0 and then restore a Windows 95
registry that was created before you installed Internet Explorer 4.0,
or use a Windows NT Emergency Repair Disk (ERD) that was created
before you installed Internet Explorer 4.0, you may be unable to
start Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
To resolve this problem, use the Ieremove.exe tool to remove Internet
Explorer 4.0. For information about how to do so, open the Microsoft
Knowledge Base at <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/default.asp,</A></B> and then
see the following articles:
<P>
<PRE>  For Windows 95, see Article <B><A HREF="../ierelease/Q166313.htm">Q166313</A></B>,
  "Removing Internet Explorer 4.0 for Windows 95 Using Ieremove.exe"

  For Windows NT, see Article <B><A HREF="../ierelease/Q166314.htm">Q166314</A></B>,
  "Removing Internet Explorer for Windows NT 4.0 Using Ieremove.exe"

</PRE><h3>Adding or Removing the Windows Desktop Update</h3>
 
To add or remove the Windows Desktop Update, carry out the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.
</OL>2. Click Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, and then click Add/Remove.
3. To remove it, click "Remove the Windows Desktop Update component
<PRE>   but keep the Internet Explorer 4.0 Web browser."

   To add it, click "Add the Windows Desktop Update component from

</PRE></OL>NOTE: For this release, clicking "Add the Windows Desktop Update
component from Web Site" opens the Internet Explorer 4.0 components
download page so you can download and install the Windows Desktop
Update. If you have previously downloaded or installed the Windows
Desktop Update, you can enable it without connecting to the Internet
by running IE4setup.exe from your local Internet Explorer 4.0 Setup
folder. When prompted, click Yes to enable the Windows Desktop
Update, and then choose to upgrade only newer items.
<P>
Installing Third-Party Add-Ons or Offers that Come
<PRE>  with Internet Explorer Plus
</PRE> 
NOTE: Microsoft does NOT provide technical support for any of the
third-party add-ons or offers included. For information about support
for other products that may have been included with this version of
Internet Explorer Plus, please see the support information in the
documentation or Help files that came with the individual
products.
<P>
To install any of the third-party programs, insert the Microsoft
InternetExplorer Plus CD into the drive. Click either Add-Ons or
Offers to readabout and install the third-party software.
<P>
Installing Internet Explorer in a Language Different
<PRE>  from the Operating System Language
</PRE> 
If you install a version of Internet Explorer in a language
different from the language of the operating system you are
running, the Windows Desktop Update will not be installed.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>USING A LOCAL AREA NETWORK PROXY SERVER OR FIREWALL</h2>
 
<P>
If your local area network or ISP uses a proxy server or firewall
to protect your network from being accessed by other people on the
Internet, carry out the following steps, which set up your computer
to gain access to the Internet through a firewall:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Internet Connection Wizard:
<P>
   - Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Internet
<P><PRE>     Explorer, and then click Connection Wizard.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Configure your computer to connect to the Internet by using
   the TCP/IP protocol on your local area network.

<P><LI>When you are prompted for the gateway address, type the IP
   address (for example, 123.456.789.123) supplied by your
   network administrator only if your organization uses gateways
   for routing information over the network.
<P>
   NOTE: The gateway computer is not the same as the proxy or
<PRE>         firewall computer that protects your local area network
         from the Internet, so do not type your proxy or firewall
         address here.

</PRE><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Internet icon, and then click the Connection
   tab.

<P><LI>In the Proxy area, select the Connect To The Internet Through
   A Proxy Server check box.

<P><LI>Click Change Proxy Settings.

<P><LI>In the first text box, type the HTTP server address for the
   computer you want to use as the proxy server. In the second text
   box, type the port number. The following is an example of a proxy
   server and port number:
<P>
   <B>http://myproxy.mycompany.com:80</B>
<P>
   In this example, you would type <B>http://myproxy.mycompany.com</B> in
   the first text box, and 80 in the second text box.
<P>
   You can use a different proxy server for different types of
   addresses. However, if you want to use the same proxy for all
   types of addresses, make sure you select the Use Same Proxy Server
   For All Addresses check box.

<P><LI>In the Exceptions area, click in the text box, and then type the
   names of the computers, domains, and ports on the Internet that,
   when accessed, will not go through the proxy server. Separate each
   item you type with a semicolon (;). If you do not know what to type
   here, see your network administrator.
<P>
   If you do not want to use the proxy server for local addresses, make
   sure you select the Do Not Use Proxy For Local (Intranet) Addresses
   check box. Local addresses are defined as those where the server
   name does not contain a period (.). For example:
<P>
<PRE>   <B>http://internalweb/</B>        is a local address.
   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</A></B>  is not a local address.

   For Help on these items, click the ? in the title bar, and then
   click the item.

</PRE><P><LI>When you have finished changing settings, click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK again to close Internet properties.
<P><PRE>    If you are running Internet Explorer, you need to restart
    your computer so that the new proxy settings can take effect.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Using the Novell NetWare 32-bit Client</h3>
 
If you are using the Novell NetWare 32-bit client with Windows 95,
add the following registry entry to your system:
<P>
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings
<PRE>   DontUseDNSLoadBalancing = (REG_DWORD) 1

</PRE></OL>This setting will ensure correct usage of proxy servers with
Internet Explorer on your network. This will be fixed in future
updates.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Internet Explorer with Socks Proxy Servers</h3>
 
If you are setting up Internet Explorer with a Socks proxy server,
you must set it up separately from other proxy information (for
example, HTTP, FTP, or Gopher). In most cases, this means that all
other proxy fields should be left blank and the Socks field should
contain the address of your Socks proxy server. The only exception
is when you are using a Socks proxy and a different proxy (for example,
HTTP) on the same connection. If you are having trouble, please contact
your network administrator for information about Socks and proxy servers.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>HTML DEVELOPERS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Structuring HTML with Framesets</h3>
 
If you are designing pages with framesets, you must use the
following HTML structure for the pages to work correctly in
Internet Explorer 4.0:
<P>
- A &lt;BODY&gt; tag (or other text or tags that force a BODY) should
<PRE>  not appear before a &lt;FRAMESET&gt; tag. If a BODY tag does precede
  the FRAMESET, the contents of the FRAMESET are discarded and the
  page will appear blank.

</PRE>- &lt;SCRIPT&gt; and &lt;OBJECT&gt; tags in a page with a &lt;FRAMESET&gt; tag must
<PRE>  appear in the &lt;HEAD&gt; section of the page.

</PRE><h3>Using the HTML Layout Control</h3>
 
Some differences may be experienced when using the HTML layout control with
IE4.0. For more information please see
<B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/layout">http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/layout</A></B>
<P>
<P><h3>ActiveX Controls in Internet Explorer 4.0</h3>
 
Because of some architectural changes in Internet Explorer 4.0 that
were needed to support a wider range of controls more efficiently,
some ActiveX Controls may not perform exactly as they did in
Internet Explorer 3.0. A common cause of this is that the control
was not created as Apartment Model Aware. Many control vendors now
offer updated controls that work properly with Internet Explorer 4.0.
If you have any problems with ActiveX Control support in Internet
Explorer 4.0, contact the control vendor to see if an updated
version of the control is available that fixes the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Problem With Visual Basic 5.0 ActiveX Controls</h3>
 
Some ActiveX Controls created with Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0 may
not function properly in Internet Explorer 4.0, because these controls
are not Apartment Model Aware. Controls that are created with VB 5.0
should be rebuilt using the Service Pack available free from Microsoft
for VB 5.0 and the Control Creation edition of VB 5.0 that allows for
the creation of Apartment Model Aware Controls.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>JAVA DEVELOPERS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Java Classes</h3>
 
As part of the VM for Java installation, the new class files are
added to the class path of developer machines. If you install a Java
development tool after installing Internet Explorer 4.0, please
run the clspack tool in your Windows directory to put the classes
on your class path. To create a single Classes.zip file in your
%WINDIR%\Java\Classes directory that contains all classes stored in
the package manager, use the following syntax: clspack -auto. This
option also adds Classes.zip to the CLASSPATH registry key.
<P>
Refreshing Java Applets Under Development
<PRE>  without Restarting Internet Explorer
</PRE> 
Microsoft Visual J++ 1.1 and other development environments have
previously required the browser to be restarted in order for updated
classes to be used while debugging. This was because of issues with
Internet Explorer loading Java classes from the cache rather than from
any updated classes on the developer's computer. Using Internet Explorer
4.0, you can just press CTRL+F5 or CTRL + the Refresh button to
cause the classes to be reloaded and any updates used.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Visual J++ with Internet Explorer 4.0</h3>
 
If you use Visual J++, you can install Internet Explorer with or
without the Windows Desktop Update. If you do choose to install the
Windows Desktop Update with the browser, you will need to do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Install Visual Studio SP2.
</OL>2. Modify your project settings as follows:
<PRE>   a. On the Project menu, click Settings.
   b. Click the Debug tab.
   c. In the Category box, click Browser.
   d. Add the -new switch to the path to the browser. For example:

      C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\Iexplore.exe -new

</PRE></OL>Note that this modification must be made on a per-project basis.
For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article <B><A HREF="../java/Q167998.htm">Q167998</A></B>.

<P>
<P><h2>KNOWN ISSUES</h2>
 
<P>
Internet Explorer Plus May Not Display Correctly
<PRE>  with Large Fonts Selected
</PRE> 
If Large Fonts is selected in the Display properties (under the
Font Size area on the Settings tab), Internet Explorer Plus may
not display its titles correctly. To correct this problem, use
Small Fonts.
<P>
<P><h3>Fighter Ace Requires DirectX 3 or Higher on Windows 95</h3>
 
On systems with Windows 95, Fighter Ace requires DirectX 3 or
higher to be installed in order to run properly. DirectX 5 can
be installed from the Internet Explorer Plus CD by following
these steps:
<P>
- On the CD drive, change directory to \dx5win95
- Run dx5eng.exe
<P>
<P><h3>PICS Support Works Differently in Internet Explorer 4.0</h3>
 
The Internet Explorer Content Advisor uses PICS (Platform for
Internet Content Selection) ratings. The PICS functionality
varies from that in Internet Explorer 3.0 in the following
instances:
<P>
- The PICS rating is not used for documents using the file://
<PRE>  protocol.

</PRE>- If you have ratings enabled, you might not be able to view
<PRE>  certain items that you've added to your Active Desktop. If
  you see a "Navigation Canceled" error message instead of Web
  content, try turning off ratings.

</PRE><h3>Some Programs Do Not Detect Browser Version Correctly</h3>
 
Some third-party Internet-based programs use non-standard
methods of detecting the current browser version. If you see this
problem in a program you are running, please contact the program
vendor for an update.
<P>
Temporary Internet Files Are Replicated
<PRE>  to the Home Directory of Roaming Users
</PRE> 
The Temporary Internet Files folder is replicated to the home
directory of users with roaming profiles. If you are running
Internet Explorer 4.0 on a Windows NT system, this may cause
disk-space problems on servers with numerous roaming users or
with several users who have with large caches. To set cache size,
click the View menu, click Internet Options, and then click the
Settings button.
<P>
<P><h3>Java Applets Will Not Print on Asian Windows 95 Computers</h3>
 
If you are running a Far East version of Windows 95, printing a page
that contains a Java applet prints only the page without the applet.
This will be fixed in a future release.
<P>
<P><h3>Using NetMeeting When Internet Explorer 4.0 Is in Offline Mode</h3>
 
If you start NetMeeting with Internet Explorer 4.0 in Offline
mode, NetMeeting will not start properly, although no error
message appears. To work around this problem, dial up using RAS
for Windows NT computers or Dial-Up Networking for Windows 95
computers. Or, in Internet Explorer, click the File menu, and
then click Work Offline to clear the check mark.
<P>
<P><h3>Access Aptiva Issues with Internet Explorer 4.0</h3>
 
The Access Aptiva component of the IBM Aptiva PC does not render
properly with Internet Explorer 4.0. To get an updated version of
the Access Aptiva program, you can either go to the IBM home page
at <B><A HREF="http://www.us.pc.ibm.com/aptiva">http://www.us.pc.ibm.com/aptiva,</A></B> or click IBM Update Connector
from the Start menu, which automatically downloads the updated
components.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>APPLICATION COMPATIBILITY</h2>
 
<P>
Adobe Acrobat: Using Internet Explorer 4.0 with

you cannot view .pdf files in the browser.
<P>
<P><h3>CleanSweep: Critical System Files Replaced</h3>
 
If you are already running Internet Explorer 4.0, installing
CleanSweep 3.0 is not recommended. CleanSweep replaces vital
system files and will cause both Internet Explorer and the
Active Desktop not to work properly.
<P>
DEC ClientWorks: Remove Xdmisrv.exe Before Installing
<PRE>  Internet Explorer 4.0
</PRE> 
If you are running DEC Client Works on a computer with Windows 95
and with no networking services installed, you should remove the
file Xdmisrv.exe from your startup group before installing Internet
Explorer 4.0. Otherwise, you may see the following error message when
your computer restarts after installation: "RPCSS caused an invalid
page fault in module OLE32 at 015F:7FFBAD35." This error does not
