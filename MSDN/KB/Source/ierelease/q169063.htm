The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook Express version 4.0 for Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Outlook Express version 4.0 for Windows NT 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Internet Mail and News version 1.0 for Windows 95

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you copy a resolved address from the To, Cc, or Bcc line of a
message and then paste it into the To, Cc, or From box in the properties
for an Inbox Assistant rule, the rule may not behave as you intend it
to. If the address contains more than one word (such as a person's first
and last name or multiple words in the name of a group), the words may
be evaluated separately instead of as a single address.
<P>
Note that this behavior is not consistent with Microsoft Outlook or
Microsoft Exchange. When you paste a resolved address into the
properties for an Inbox Assistant rule in Outlook or Microsoft Exchange,
the words are evaluated as a single address instead of separately.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you paste a resolved address that contains more than one word into
the properties for an Inbox Assistant rule, the words are not enclosed
in quotation marks. This causes Outlook Express and Internet Mail to
evaluate them separately instead of as a single address.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, enclose the address in quotation marks
after you paste it into the To, Cc, or From box. This causes the words
to be evaluated as a single address instead of separately.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you copy the resolved group name "My Group" from a message and then
paste it into the To box in the properties for an Inbox Assistant rule
that moves messages to the Test folder, the rule's description appears
as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Move to: 'Test' if To contains 'My' and 'Group'

</PRE>This causes all messages that contain the word "My" or the word "Group"
on the To line to be moved to the Test folder. If you want only messages
that contain the address "My Group" on the To line to be moved to the
Test folder, enclose the address in quotation marks in the properties
for the rule. After you do so, the rule's description appears as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Move to: 'Test' if To contains 'My Group'
</PRE>
