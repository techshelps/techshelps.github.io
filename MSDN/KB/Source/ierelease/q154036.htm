</PRE><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists troubleshooting steps to help you troubleshoot problems
with active content such as ActiveX scripts, ActiveX controls, and Java
programs in Internet Explorer for Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are unable to load a particular Web page using Internet Explorer,
the problem may be caused by active content that the Web page
contains. To determine if this is the case, perform the following steps.
<P>
After performing each step, check to see if you are able to successfully
load the Web page. If you are able to successfully load the Web page,
you should contact the administrator of the Web site to report the
problem and inquire about additional methods to access the Web page.

<OL><P><LI>Configure Internet Explorer so that it does not run ActiveX scripts
   automatically. To do so, use the appropriate method:
<P>
</OL><h3>Internet Explorer 3.x</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Options, click the Security tab, and then click
   the Run ActiveX Scripts check box under Active Content to clear it.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Internet Explorer 4.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Internet Options, click the Security tab, click
   Custom (for expert users), and then click Settings.

<P><LI>Scroll down to the Scripting section, click Disable under Scripting for
   Java applets and Active Scripting, click OK, and then click OK.
<P>
   NOTE: In Internet Explorer, the term "ActiveX scripting" refers to
   both Java scripting and Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition.
   Clearing the Run ActiveX Scripts check box disables both types of
   scripts.
<P>
   If you are able to load the Web page after performing this step,
   the problem is being caused by an ActiveX script that the Web page
   contains. The script most likely is written incorrectly, or contains
   unsupported objects, properties, or elements.

<P><LI>Configure Internet Explorer so that it does not automatically use items
   that show active content, such as vertical marquees or animations.
   To do so, use the appropriate method:
<P>
</OL><h3>Internet Explorer 3.x</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click Options on the View menu, click the Security tab, and then click
   the Enable ActiveX Controls And Plug-Ins check box under Active Content
   to clear it.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Internet Explorer 4.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Internet Options, click the Security tab, click
   Custom, and then click Settings.

<P><LI>Click Disable under "Download unsigned Active X controls," "Script
   ActiveX controls marked safe for scripting," "Initialize and script
   ActiveX controls not marked as safe," "Download signed ActiveX
   controls," "Run ActiveX controls and plugins," click OK, and then click
   OK.
<P>
   If you are able to load the Web page after performing this step,
   the problem is being caused by active content that the Web page
   contains.

<P><LI>Verify that Internet Explorer's internal Java Just-In-Time (JIT)
   compiler is disabled.
<P>
   To do so, use the appropriate method:
<P>
</OL><h3>Internet Explorer 3.x</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu click Options, click the Advanced tab, and then click
   the Enable Java JIT Compiler check box to cleared it.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Internet Explorer 4.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Internet Options, click the Advanced tab, and
   then click the Java JIT Compiler Enabled check box under Java VM to
   clear it.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
   If the problem is caused by a Java program that the Web page contains
   and the problem still occurs when the Java JIT Compiler is disabled,
   the Internet Explorer status bar should display a message that provides
   additional information about the problem. If the message indicates that
   a particular class is not found, the appropriate class file may not
   exist on the server that contains the Web page, or the server may be
   too busy.

<P><LI>Configure Internet Explorer so that it does not run Java programs
   automatically.
<P>
   To do so, use the appropriate method:
<P>
</OL><h3>Internet Explorer 3.x</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Options, click the Security tab, and then click
   the Enable Java Programs check box under Active Content to clear it.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Internet Explorer 4.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Internet Options, click the Security tab, click
   Custom, and then click Settings.

<P><LI>Click Disable Java under the Java Permissions in the Security Settings
   dialog box, and then click OK twice.
<P>
   If you are able to load the Web page after performing this step,
   the problem is being caused by one or more Java programs that the Web
   page contains.
<P>
</OL><h3>Customizing Safety Levels for Active Content</h3>
 
<P>
While most active content contained in Web pages is safe, some Web pages
contain active content that can potentially cause security problems on
your computer. For example, an ActiveX control that runs automatically
when you load a particular Web page might damage your data or cause your
computer to become infected with a virus. Internet Explorer uses safety
levels for active content to help prevent this situation from occurring.
<P>
The following safety levels for active content are available in Internet
Explorer:
<P>
Internet Explorer 3.02
 

<UL><LI>High (recommended for all users)
   You are protected from all security problems. Potentially unsafe
   Content is avoided, and you are notified.

<LI>Medium (recommended for experts and developers)
   You are warned of all security problems. You can choose whether or not
   to view potentially unsafe content.

<LI>None (not recommended)
   You are not protected from any security problems. Use this setting only
   if you are sure all sites you visit are safe.
<P>
</UL>To modify the safety level for active content, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Options, click the Security tab, and then click
   Safety Level under Active Content.

<P><LI>Click the safety level you want to use, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>Internet Explorer 4.0
 

<UL><LI>High (most secure)
   Exclude content that could damage your computer.

<LI>Medium (more secure)
   Warn before running potentially damaging content.

<LI>Low
   Do not warn before running potentially damaging content.

<LI>Custom (for expert users)
   Base security on settings you choose.
<P>
</UL>To modify the safety level for active content, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Internet Options, click the Security tab.

<P><LI>Click Zone and the security level for the zone you want to use, and
   then click OK.
<P>
</OL>If the safety level for active content is set to High, the following
message is displayed when you attempt to access a Web page that may cause
a security problem:
<P>
<PRE>   This page contains active content that is not verifiably safe to
   display. To protect your computer, this content will not be displayed.

   Choose Help to find how you can change your safety settings so you can
   view potentially unsafe content.

</PRE></OL>If the safety level for active content is set to Medium, the following
message is displayed when you attempt to access a Web page that may cause
a security problem:
<P>
<PRE>   The object handler for the specified type could not be found. Do you
   wish to locate an object handler for this type?

</PRE>If you click Yes, the Microsoft Component Builders Web page is displayed.
You can load the appropriate ActiveX control, if it is available, from
this page.
<P>
In some cases, the following message is displayed when the safety level
for active content is set to Medium and you attempt to access a Web page
that may cause a security problem:
<P>
<PRE>   A Windows application is attempting to open or install the following
   software component:

   &lt;address&gt;

   The component has been digitally "signed" by its publisher, but the
   signature does not match the component. It is possible that this
   component has been damaged or tampered with. Do you wish to continue?
