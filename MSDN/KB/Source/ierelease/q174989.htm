The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook Express version 4.0 for Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Outlook Express version 4.0 for Windows NT 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you view the properties of an Outlook Express e-mail message, the
sent time may be:

<UL><LI>Later than the received time.

<LI>Marked with the same sent and delivered time.

<LI>Marked with a received time that is different than the actual time you
   received the message.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The behavior can occur if the time is not set correctly on:

<UL><LI>The mail server that sent the message.

<LI>The mail server that received the message.

<LI>Both the mail server that sent the message, and the mail server that
   received the message.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook Express follows the RFC 822 specification. RFC 822 defines
Internet standards for recording time zone information and defines ten
alphabetic time zone labels. Time zone offsets West of Greenwich are
expressed as negative numbers and time zone offsets East of Greenwich are
expressed as positive numbers. Local time is calculated by the receiving
server from the message header of the sending mail server. The recognized
time zones are:
<P>
<PRE>Time Zone Label      Numeric Offset
---------------      --------------
GMT                  +  0:00
UT                   +  0:00
EST                  - 05:00
EDT                  - 04:00
CST                  - 06:00
CDT                  - 05:00
MST                  - 07:00
MDT                  - 06:00
PST                  - 08:00
PDT                  - 07:00

</PRE>All other time zone offsets are expected to be numeric only, so that the
time adjustment for the local time zone is correct. If an alphabetic time
zone label is used, and it is not one of the RFC 822 defined labels, then
the alphabetic offsets do not adjust the "local" time correctly because it
does not calculate a correct adjustment from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
<P>
For example, if the mail server is using a time zone such as HKT +02:00
instead of a RFC 822 defined time zone label, the time is adjusted
incorrectly. To correctly define the time zone label on the mail server,
drop HKT from the time zone and just use "+02:00" so that the mail is time
stamped properly. If the server is able to calculate the time properly for
HKT +02:00, then a mail server program is calculating the time stamp with
time zone labels that do not comply with the RFC 822 standard.
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange client is able to properly calculate the time from
all ten time zones listed in the RFC 822, provided they follow the
standard for this time zone in the SMTP header. All others must be listed
in numeric form.
<P>
Servers supporting the RFC 822 environment need to be configured to use
numeric GMT offsets for the correct date and time stamping of messages
from around the world.
