Macintosh. The WWW is the fastest growing component of the Internet today.
In order to use a WWW browser, you will need a modem or network access,
access to the Internet, and software that enables your computer to
communicate with the Internet.
<P>
If you performed a minimum or custom install and did not install
Java[ASCII 153] components, the Java features discussed in these Release

Tips and Troubleshooting
<P>
Problems Launching Internet Explorer
In general, if you are experiencing difficulties accessing any page on the
World Wide Web, please try one or both of the following:
<P>
Delete the Explorer folder and the MS Internet Cache folder
1. Open your hard drive, and then open the System folder.
2. Open the Preferences folder, and then drag the Explorer folder and
<PRE>   the MS Internet Cache folder to your desktop.
</PRE>3. Launch Internet Explorer again. New Explorer and MS Internet Cache
<PRE>   folders will be automatically created.
</PRE>4. To use your old favorites, open the Explorer folder on your desktop
<PRE>   from step 2, and then drag the "favorites.html" file into the new
   Explorer folder (located in the Preferences folder).
</PRE>5. Once you're satisfied that your browser is working properly and your
<PRE>   favorites have been saved (they appear in the favorites window in
   Explorer), feel free to throw away the Explorer and MS Internet Cache
   folders on your desktop as they may unnecessarily consume hard drive
   space.

</PRE>Delete the Internet preferences file
1. Open your hard drive, and then open the System folder.
2. Open the Preferences folder, and then drag the Internet Preferences
<PRE>   file to your desktop.
</PRE>3. Launch Internet Explorer again. A new Internet Preferences file will
<PRE>   be automatically created.
</PRE>4. If you have modified your default Internet Config settings,  you will
<PRE>   need to reset them again.

</PRE>Empty Internet Explorer's Cache
<P>
Printing a Web Page that Uses Frames
Some web pages are designed using frames (subsections of the window that
display different information). In order to print the information in a
particular frame, click in that frame and choose Print from the File menu.
<P>
Offline Browsing
Downloading large Web sites is memory intensive and may consume a lot of
disk space. Java applets and Macintosh ActiveX controls are not downloaded
for offline browsing.
<P>
QuickTime and QuickTime PowerPlug
If you have QuickTime installed, Internet Explorer requires that the
QuickTime PowerPlug be installed in your Extensions folder in your System
folder. QuickTime extensions are available for download from
<B>http://quicktime.apple.com/.</B>
<P>
QuickTime and QuickDraw 3D
If you use the Extensions Manager to disable QuickTime and QuickDraw 3D,
you need to remove the appropriate QuickTime and QuickDraw 3D libraries.
<P>
VRML
If you are using Internet Explorer to view VRML pages, you must have
QuickDraw 3D version 1.5 or later installed. QuickDraw 3D  is available
for download from <B>http://quickdraw3d.apple.com/.</B>
<P>
Plug-ins
If you experience problems viewing a page that uses plug-ins, you will
most likely need to increase the memory allotted to Internet Explorer.  To
do so, quit Internet Explorer if it is running, select the Internet
Explorer icon, and then choose Get Info from the File menu. (Make sure you
select the icon for the Internet Explorer program, not an alias to the
program.) Try increasing the Preferred Size to 8000K.
<P>
ActiveX
Some Web pages may have ActiveX controls that have been built for the
Win32 platform and don't support Mac OS.  If this happens and you are
unable to view the page, you can turn off the viewing of ActiveX content.
To do so, choose Preferences from the Edit menu,  click Web Content under
Web Browser, and then clear the Enable ActiveX check box.  If this fixes
your problem, the ActiveX control most likely did not support Mac OS.
<P>
Note: Please be aware that in this release, Internet Explorer cannot
verify the integrity of ActiveX controls.  Download and use ActiveX
controls from trusted servers only.
<P>
VBScript
Internet Explorer does not currently support VBScript, however, most pages
use JScript.  If you open a page that uses VBScript Internet Explorer will
alert you with a dialog box.
<P>
Browsing Secure Pages through a Proxy Server
Sometimes you may encounter difficulties in accessing secure web pages
when browsing through a proxy server. With certain proxy servers you may
be able to correct this situation (the proxy server must support
tunneling):
1. Choose Preferences from the Edit menu
2. Click on "Proxies" in the lefthand column of the Preferences Window
3. Using the "Method" popup menu choose "Tunnel"
4. Click "OK"
<P>
 
 
<P>
Using Help
<P>
Internet Explorer Help is available from the Help (?) menu and will give
you the information you need to use the powerful features of Internet
Explorer.
<UL><LI>Click a topic area on the left to see a list of related procedures. To
   open the procedures in a separate window, press and hold on the topic
   area link, and then choose Open Link In New Window from the menu that
   appears.
<LI>Click Index to see the Index. Use the Index just as you would an index
   in a book.
<LI>Click Tips &amp; Tricks for information about a particular menu item and
   its keyboard shortcut.
<LI>Internet Explorer Help is best viewed in Internet Explorer.
<LI>To print, click in the frame that contains the information you want,
   and then choose Print from the File menu.
<P>
</UL>
