<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to remove, export and import digital
certificates in Internet Explorer and Outlook Express.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Digital certificates, referred to as digital IDs in Outlook Express, are
digitally signed statements that bind an encrypted key pair to a user's
identity. This key can be used to sign and encrypt digital information.
You can use digital certificates to verify that another person has the
right to use a given identity.
<P>
A digital certificate is signed by the Certification Authority that issued
the certificate. A Certification Authority is a company responsible for
issuing digital IDs and continuously verifying that digital IDs are still
valid. The digital certificate is composed of a public key, a private key,
and other identity information. This information may include the version
of the Web browser, the operating system and the version of the operating
system. The digital certificate may also include your e-mail address so
that Outlook Express can use it as a digital ID. Depending on the
information bound to the digital certificate by the Certifying Authority,
it may not be possible to use the digital certificate after you upgrade
the operating system or the Web browser, or to use the digital certificate
on a different computer.
<P>
You can attach multiple digital certificates to a message or transaction,
forming a certification chain where each certificate proves the
authenticity of the previous certificate. The top-level Certification
Authority must be independently known and trusted by the recipient.
<P>
When you install a digital certificate in a Web browser, it functions as
electronic credentials that can be used by secure Web sites. This enables
digital certificates to be used in place of password dialog boxes,
services that require membership, or services that restrict access to
particular users.
<P>
Outlook Express supports Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
(S/MIME) technology. Secure e-mail in Outlook Express protects your
Internet communications using the following methods:

<UL><LI>Digital signatures
<LI>Encryption
<P>
</UL>Digitally signing your e-mail message with a unique ID assures the person
who receives the message that you are the true sender of the message, and
that the message was not altered in transit. Encrypting mail that you send
ensures that no one except the intended recipient can read the contents of
the message while it is in transit. When you send your digital ID to
others, you are actually giving them your public key. In order for another
person to send you encrypted mail they must have your public key. When
another person sends you e-mail that includes your public key, only you
can read the message because your private key is required to decrypt it.
<P>
Internet Explorer stores digital certificates in the registry. Outlook
Express uses these digital certificates to digitally sign and encrypt
secure e-mail
<P>
Because Outlook Express can manage multiple e-mail accounts, you can have
a digital certificate associated with each of your e-mail accounts. The
registry keys that contain the entries for your digital certificates do
not contain any information about the Web address with which it is
associated. For this reason, if you have multiple e-mail accounts for
which you have obtained a digital certificate, you should export the
digital certificate before you remove it.
<P>
<P><h3>Exporting Digital Certificates</h3>
 
<P>
To export digital certificates, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-
   click Internet.

<P><LI>On the Content tab, click Personal, click a certificate you want to
   export, and then click Export.

<P><LI>If necessary, type the file name and password to encrypt, confirm the
   password, and then click OK. The file name should have a .pfx
   extension. By default, the file is saved to the My Documents folder
   if it exists. If the My Documents folder does not exist, the file is
   saved to the Windows folder.
<P>
</OL><h3>Removing Digital Certificates</h3>
 
<P>
When a digital certificate is removed, any e-mail that is encrypted with
the associated digital ID is no longer readable. This includes e-mail that
you received before you removed the digital certificate, as well as e-mail
you receive after you remove the digital certificate. The e-mail is
encrypted using your public key, and because the digital certificate has
been removed, you no longer have the private key needed to decrypt it. To
read this e-mail again, you must import the digital certificate back into
Internet Explorer, and then enabled it in Outlook Express. There is no
method of exporting encrypted e-mail to an unencrypted format. If you
receive any encrypted mail that you must be able to access, make sure you
have successfully exported the digital certificate before you remove it.
You may also be unable to view any Web sites that require client
authentication based on that digital certificate until you either import
it again, or generate another digital certificate to use for that Web
site.
<P>
For these reasons, Microsoft does not recommend removing digital
certificates. You should keep the current digital certificate and obtain a
new one for a new e-mail account or Web site that requires one. However,
if this is not possible, and a digital certificate must be removed due to
incorrect operation or for troubleshooting purposes, follow these steps:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry
Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys
And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit
it.
<P>
Delete all the folders under the following registry key, and then restart
your computer:
<P>
<PRE>      HKEY_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\My\
         Certificates

</PRE></OL>When you remove the digital certificate from Internet Explorer, the
associated digital ID is removed from Outlook Express.
<P>
<P><h3>Importing Digital Certificates</h3>
 
<P>
To import digital certificates that you previously exported, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-
   click Internet.

<P><LI>On the Content tab, click Personal, and then click Import.

<P><LI>In the Password box, type your password.

<P><LI>In the Certificate File To Import box, type the filename of the
   certificate you want to import, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click Close, and then click OK.
