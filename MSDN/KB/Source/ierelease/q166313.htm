   so.

   Explorer 4.0 while Internet Explorer 4.0 was still installed on your
   computer.

   Note that you do not need to perform step 1 in the "More Information"
   section in this article under this condition.
<P>
</UL>Do not follow the steps described in this article in the following

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Uninstall Internet Explorer 4.0

</PRE><LI>You have removed the Internet Explorer 4.0 backup files. If you removed
   the backup files and you are unable to uninstall Internet Explorer 4.0
   by using the steps described in the article in the previous bulleted
   item, you cannot remove Internet Explorer 4.0 without reinstalling
   Microsoft Windows 95 in a different folder.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To remove Internet Explorer 4.0 by using the Ieremove.exe tool and a
registry that was created before you installed Internet Explorer
4.0, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>If you have not already done so, restore a registry that was created
   before you installed Internet Explorer 4.0.
<P>
   NOTE: Internet Explorer 4.0 replaces the original System.1st file with
   a copy of the registry created during the Internet Explorer 4.0
   installation. The original System.1st file is saved in the Integrated
   Browser.dat file (Integr~1.dat) during the Internet Explorer 4.0
   installation.
<P>
   To extract the original System.1st file from the Integr~1.dat file,
   type the following commands at a command prompt. Press ENTER after each
   command
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd &lt;path&gt;\uninst~1
      attrib integr~1.dat -h
      iextract /L &lt;dir&gt; integr~1.dat system.1st
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;path&gt; is the path to the folder in which Internet Explorer is
   installed, and &lt;dir&gt; is the folder in which the extracted file will be
   saved.
<P>
   For additional information about using the System.1st
   file to restore the registry to the state when you first started
   Windows 95 successfully, see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Troubleshoot Registry Errors

</PRE><P><LI>Restart the computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message,
   press the F8 key, and then choose Safe Mode Command Prompt Only from
   the Startup menu.

<P><LI>Type the following commands, pressing ENTER after each command
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd &lt;path&gt;\uninst~1
      attrib integr~1.dat -h
      iextract integr~1.dat
      copy shell32.dll c:\windows\system
      copy explorer.exe c:\windows
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;path&gt; is the path to the folder in which Internet Explorer is
   installed.

<P><LI>Restart the computer.

<P><LI>Click Start, click Run, type the following command in the Open box
   (with quotation marks), and then click OK
<P>
<P><PRE>      "&lt;path1&gt;\ieremove.exe" /i:"&lt;path2&gt;\integrated browser.dat"
      /n:"&lt;path3&gt;\ie4bak.dat"
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;path1&gt; is the full path to the Ieremove.exe file, &lt;path2&gt; is the
   full path to the Integrated Browser.dat file, and &lt;path3&gt; is the full
   path to the Ie4bak.dat file. For example, if the Ieremove.exe file is
   located in the C:\Windows\System folder, the Integrated Browser.dat
   file is located in the C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer Uninstall
   Information folder, and the Ie4bak.dat file is located in the
   C:\Windows folder, type the following command (with quotation marks):
<P>
<P><PRE>      "c:\windows\system\ieremove.exe" /i:"c:\program files\internet
      explorer\uninstall information\integrated browser.dat"
      /n:"c:\windows\ie4bak.dat"
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK, click Yes, and then restart your computer after the
   Ieremove.exe tool is finished running.
