The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When attempting to start Microsoft Outlook 97, you may get the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The MAPI Spooler could not be started. Close and then
   restart all mail-enabled applications MAPI 1.0 (000004c7)

</PRE>followed by the message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to open the Outlook window.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A missing Mapisp32.exe file causes this problem. The Mapisp32.exe file may
have been removed or renamed by your anti-virus program. This problem has
been reported when using ThunderByte Anti-Virus software, manufactured by
TCT-ThunderByte Corp, but may also be caused by other anti-virus programs.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Copy the Mapisp32.exe file from your setup Compact Disc and set your anti-
virus program to ignore the file.
<P>
If Mapisp32.exe is present and in the proper location, uninstall Outlook
including Windows Messaging and reinstall Outlook.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you disable your anti-virus software during installation, Outlook may
run immediately after installation but fail to run (giving the error
messages above) after a restart of the computer. This is because restarting
the computer reinitiates the anti-virus software. The ThunderByte anti-
virus software defaults to "Rename" for any new program file found on the
system. You must instruct it to ignore the Mapisp32.exe program.
<P>
ThunderByte Anti-Virus is manufactured by CT-ThunderByte Corp., a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability
