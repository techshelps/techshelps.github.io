<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When importing data containing phone numbers from other programs such as
Microsoft Access or Microsoft Excel, the phone numbers may be displayed
with ".000" appended to the end. The numbers will not contain any
parentheses or hyphens and in some cases the number may be completely
different from the number in the original program.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because Outlook does not recognize the numbers being
imported as phone numbers, even if they look like phone numbers when viewed
in the original program; this happens when the number is imported from a
Numeric-type field. An example of this is when a field in Microsoft Excel
is formatted as a phone number even though it is typed as a 10-digit
number. In Microsoft Excel, it is possible to use a "Phone Number" format;
once this format has been applied, you may type a number such as 5551234567
and Microsoft Excel will display it as (555)123-4567.  When this number is
imported into Outlook, it is interpreted as 5551234567 instead of (555)123-
4567. If a phone number is typed into Microsoft Excel with the parentheses
and hyphens, Outlook will interpret it as a phone number.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the phone number is typed into the original program with the parentheses
and hyphens, Outlook will interpret it correctly.  If you are importing a
large amount of data and it is not practical to manually add the
parentheses and hyphens, try exporting the data from the original program
as a Comma Separated Value (.CSV) file. Most programs such as Microsoft
Access and Microsoft Excel will include the parentheses and hyphens as part
of text file, thus making it possible for Outlook to properly interpret the
data.
<P>
For information on exporting data from your original program as a comma
separated value text file, consult the documentation supplied with that
program.
