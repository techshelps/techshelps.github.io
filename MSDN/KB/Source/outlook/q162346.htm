</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the implications of using Exchng32.exe (the
Microsoft Exchange Client version 4.0) to troubleshoot Outlook problems
when working with Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft Mail Server, or a
mix of the two servers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook ships with an Exchange client, Exchng32.exe. You can use this
program to determine if your problem is unique to Outlook. The exact
location of this file varies, depending on the operating system. By
default, Exchng32.exe is either in the Microsoft Exchange or in the Windows
Messaging subfolder. The file size is 83,776 bytes with a date of 11/17/96.
Double-click Exchng32.exe to start the Exchange Client.
<P>
While both Exchng32.exe and Outlook can use your existing profiles and
services, there are some behavioral differences between these two mail
clients when used on a computer that has Outlook installed.
<P>
<P><h3>Sending and Receiving E-mail Messages</h3>
 
<P>
Both clients can send and receive messages using the same user profiles. If
your existing profile does not work with either client, you may have a
server or profile problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Views</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Client cannot display any Outlook non-table views; the
two programs use different formats to create saved views. Outlook
recognizes both formats, but Exchange Client recognizes only its own
format.
<P>
Exchange Client cannot use saved views created by Outlook, unless the
Outlook user selected the "Save views in Exchange 4.0 format" property for
the Outlook folder. With this property selected, Exchange Client can view a
table view saved by Outlook.
<P>
<P><h3>Rich Text in Messages</h3>
 
<P>
Outlook and Exchange Client both support rich text in messages.
<P>
<P><h3>Message Attachments and Embedded Objects</h3>
 
<P>
Outlook and Exchange Client can send and receive messages with attachments
and embedded objects. Both programs can send and receive messages that have
other messages attached.
<P>
<P><h3>Embedded Hyperlinks in Messages</h3>
 
<P>
Both programs support messages with embedded hyperlink jumps.
<P>
<P><h3>Public Folders</h3>
 
<P>
Both programs can use a common set of public folders, although Exchange
Client cannot display any non-table views created by Outlook. Microsoft
Mail Server does not support public folders.
<P>
<P><h3>Rules</h3>
 
<P>
Both Exchange Client and Outlook support Inbox Assistant. Outlook users can
install an optional Outlook Rules Wizard from the Internet at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/OfficeFreeStuff/Outlook/">http://www.microsoft.com/OfficeFreeStuff/Outlook/</A></B>
 
</PRE>The wizard adds more functionality to the Inbox Assistant.
<P>
When Outlook is a client on Microsoft Mail Server, Outlook users can
continue to use rules because Outlook rules can be stored on the client, as
well as the server. Exchange Client cannot use rules with Microsoft Mail
Server.
<P>
<P><h3>Forms</h3>
 
<P>
Outlook users can use forms created in Microsoft Exchange Client with the
Electronic Forms Designer (EFD). Only Outlook can use Office forms.
<P>
<P><h3>Message Size</h3>
 
<P>
Outlook and Exchange Client messages can be of any size (subject to system
resources).
<P>
<P><h3>WordMail</h3>
 
<P>
Exchange Client can use either Microsoft Word 95 or Microsoft Word 97 for
WordMail. Outlook must use Microsoft Word 97 for WordMail.
