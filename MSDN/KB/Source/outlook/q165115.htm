The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a list of known interoperability problems between
Outlook 97 and Apple Macintosh files. This article discusses the following
issues you may encounter when using Outlook with Macintosh file
attachments:

<UL><LI>Attachments lose icon information

<LI>Attached text file added to message body

<LI>Forwarded Macintosh binary attachment loses resource fork

<LI>File becomes unusable dragging Macintosh attachment in Outlook

<LI>Cannot open saved message attachment
<P>
</UL>Microsoft has confirmed these issues to be problems in Microsoft Outlook 97
for Windows. The indicated issues were corrected in Microsoft Outlook 97
version 8.02 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Attachments Lose Icon Information</h3>
 
<P>
If you send an attached file from Microsoft Exchange for the Macintosh to
Outlook, the attached file icon may change to the generic Windows icon
(white page with Windows flag). Some Macintosh icons lose their properties
when opened in Outlook.
<P>
This issue is fixed in Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.02.
<P>
<P><h3>Attached Text File Added to Message Body</h3>
 
<P>
If you create an Outlook message with a text file attachment, and save the
message in a public folder, the message opens in the Exchange for the
Macintosh client with the text showing in the message body. The attached
text file becomes part of the text in the message body.
<P>
<P><h3>Forwarded Macintosh Binary Attachment Loses Resource Fork</h3>
 
<P>
If you use Outlook to forward a message to an Exchange for the Macintosh
client and the message contains a Macintosh binary file attachment, the
attached file loses its resource fork and is unusable.
<P>
This issue is fixed in Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.02.
<P>
Saved Macintosh Binary Attachment Loses Resource Fork
 
<P>
If you use Outlook to save a Macintosh binary file attachment, the file
becomes unusable when moved back to the Macintosh operating system.
<P>
<P><h3>File Becomes Unusable Dragging Macintosh Attachment in Outlook</h3>
 
<P>
If you drag a Macintosh file attachment from one Outlook message to another
or into another Outlook, messaging application programming interface, MAPI
folder, the attached file becomes unusable.
<P>
This issue is fixed in Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.02.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Open Saved Message Attachment</h3>
 
<P>
You may not be able to open a message file attachment previously saved by
Outlook. To reproduce this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Using the Exchange for Macintosh client, create a public folder and
   give your Outlook profile Owner permissions to the folder.

<P><LI>On the Macintosh, create a message that contains a text attachment.

<P><LI>Post the message to the public folder.

<P><LI>Using Outlook, open the message from the public folder.

<P><LI>Double-click the attachment to open it in Notepad.

<P><LI>Make a change to the text file, save, and close the text file and the
   message, clicking Yes to all changes.

<P><LI>Attempt to open the attached file in Outlook.
<P>
</OL>Outlook cannot re-open the message attachment just saved. The Exchange for
Macintosh client cannot open the attachment without using a translator.
<P>
This issue is fixed in Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.02.
