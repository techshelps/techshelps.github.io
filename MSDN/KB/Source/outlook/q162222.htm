<P>
<P><h3>IMPORTANT: Disable Virus Protection Before Running Setup</h3>
 
<P>
Some virus protection programs, such as VSafe.com and Norton Anti- Virus
Autoprotect, can interfere with the Microsoft Outlook 97 Setup program. If
you use a virus protection program on your computer, please disable it
before running Setup. (You can re- enable the virus protection program
after Setup is complete.) Note: If your virus-detection program starts
automatically when you start Windows, you can disable it by restarting
Windows while holding down the SHIFT key.
<P>
<P><h3>Minimum System Requirements for Microsoft Outlook 97</h3>
 
<P>
To use Microsoft Outlook 97, you need:

<UL><LI>Personal or Multimedia computer with a 486 or higher processor.
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 operating system or Windows NT Workstation
   3.51 with Service Pack 5 or later (will not run on earlier
   versions).
<LI>8 MB of memory for use on Windows 95; 16 MB of memory for use
   on Windows NT Workstation.
<LI>26-46 MB of hard disk space required; 31 MB required for
   typical installation, depending on configuration (use the
   Office Upgrade Wizard during setup to maximize free disk
   space).
<LI>CD-ROM drive (coupon enclosed for 3.5-inch high-density disks;
   CD-ROM contains Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft
   Camcorder, clip art, and templates not available on 3.5-inch
   disks).
<LI>VGA or higher-resolution video adapter (Super VGA, 256-color
   recommended).
<LI>Microsoft Mouse, Microsoft IntelliMouse, or compatible pointing
   device.
<P>
</UL>Additional items or services required to use certain features:

<UL><LI>9600 or higher-baud modem (14,400 baud recommended).
<LI>Multimedia computer required to access sound and other
   multimedia effects.
<LI>Microsoft Mail, Microsoft Exchange, Internet SMTP/POP3, or
   other MAPI-compliant messaging software required to use e-
   mail.
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Server required for certain advanced
   workgroup functionality.
<LI>8 MB of additional memory required to run WordMail.
<LI>Some Internet functionality may require Internet access and
   payment of a separate fee to a service provider.
<P>
</UL><h3>Requirements for Microsoft Outlook 97 with Windows NT Workstation 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
To use Microsoft Outlook 97 with Windows NT Workstation 4.0, you must
install Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Punctuation Characters in Directory Names May Cause Problems</h3>
 
<P>
If the name of the directory you install Microsoft Office 97, Microsoft
Excel 97, Microsoft Outlook 97, Microsoft PowerPoint 97, or Microsoft Word
97 into includes a comma (,), single quotation mark ('), or exclamation
point (!), you may have problems when you use the programs. To avoid
problems, use the default directory or use only letters and numbers in
directory names.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Up Outlook for People Who Share a Computer</h3>
 
<P>
The first time you start Outlook on a computer on which no user profile
exists, Outlook creates a default user profile (C:\\Win95\Profiles\
Microsoft Outlook) for one person. When several people share a computer,
each person should have a separate user profile that includes an e-mail
service, the Outlook Address Book, and a personal folder (.pst) file (if a
Microsoft Exchange Server computer is not used to store Outlook data).
<P>
To set up Outlook on a shared computer, follow these general
steps (for more information, see Microsoft Outlook Help):

<OL><P><LI>Run the Setup program for Office 97 or Outlook 97.

<P><LI>Don't start Outlook yet.

<P><LI>In Windows Control Panel, double-click the Mail icon, and then add
   a profile for each user. Use a unique name for each profile.

<P><LI>In each profile, add an e-mail service and the Outlook Address Book
   service. If necessary, also add a Personal Folders service to store
   Outlook data in a file on your hard disk, rather than on a server.
   (Personal folder files are stored in the Win95 folder by default
   and have a .pst extension.)

<P><LI>Start Outlook.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the General tab.

<P><LI>Select the Prompt For A Profile To Be Used check box.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You can create a password for a personal folder file to protect the
Outlook data it contains. If you use the default user profile before you
create individual user profiles for each additional person who uses the
computer, do not password-protect the default personal folder file
(Outlook.pst). If you do so, the additional users won't be able to use
Outlook.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Up Outlook for Use With Schedule+</h3>
 
<P>
If you are upgrading from the version of Schedule+ 95 installed with Office
95 to Outlook 97 or Office 97 while concurrently migrating from Microsoft
Mail 3.x to Microsoft Exchange Server, you may need to complete the
following installation steps before you install Outlook 97 or Office 97.

<UL><LI>If you want to access calendar information for Schedule+ 95
   users who are also using Microsoft Exchange Server from
   Outlook, you must uninstall Schedule+ 95 before you install
   Outlook 97 or Office 97.

<LI>If you want to use Schedule+ 95 as your primary calendar in
   Outlook, you must install the version of Schedule+ 95 that
   comes with Microsoft Exchange Server before you install
   Outlook 97 or Office 97.
<P>
</UL><h3>Removing Schedule+ After You Install Outlook</h3>
 
<P>
If you already have Schedule+ installed on your computer when you install
Outlook 97 or Office 97, the Setup program keeps Schedule+ so you can
import Schedule+ information into Outlook or share information with others
who use Schedule+ in the following ways: view free/busy details of
Schedule+ users, open a Schedule+ appointment book in Outlook, and use
Schedule+ 95 as your primary calendar in Outlook.
<P>
After you import Schedule+ information into Outlook and you no longer need
to use Schedule+ to share information, you may want to delete Schedule+ for
more hard disk space on your computer.
<P>
If you delete Schedule+ and later need to use it with Outlook, you can run
the Setup program for Outlook 97 or Office 97 to install the Schedule+
files you need. To install the Schedule+ files, you must uninstall and then
reinstall the Schedule+ Support Files option. Follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Setup program for Outlook 97 or Office 97 to uninstall the
   Schedule+ support files.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If you installed Outlook with Office 97, click Microsoft Office
      97 on the Install/Uninstall tab, and then click Add/Remove. In
      the Setup program, click Add/Remove, click Microsoft Outlook,
      click Change Option, and then clear the Schedule+ Support Files
      check box.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If you installed Outlook by itself, click Microsoft Outlook 97
      on the Install/Uninstall tab, and then click Add/Remove. In the
      Setup program, click Add/Remove, and then clear the Schedule+
      Support Files check box.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run the Setup program again, but this time select the Schedule+
   Support Files check box.
<P>
</OL><h3>Installing Microsoft Fax After You Install Outlook</h3>
 
<P>
If you use Outlook with Windows 95 and you want to install the Microsoft
Fax component of Windows 95, you must perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Remove Outlook (using the Add/Remove Programs icon in Windows
   Control Panel).
<P>
<P><PRE>    - If you installed Outlook with Office 97, click Microsoft Office
      97 on the Install/Uninstall tab, and then click Add/Remove. In
      the Setup program, click Add/Remove, and then clear the
      Microsoft Outlook check box to remove Outlook only. You do not
      need to remove other Office 97 programs.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If you installed Outlook by itself, click Microsoft Outlook 97
      on the Install/Uninstall tab, and then click Add/Remove. In the
      Setup program, click Remove All.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Install Microsoft Fax (using the Add/Remove Programs icon in
   Windows Control Panel, from the Windows Setup tab).

<P><LI>Run the Setup program for Outlook 97 or Office 97 to install
   Outlook again.
<P>
</OL>If you use Outlook with Windows NT Workstation 3.51 or later, Microsoft Fax
is not available.
<P>
USING INBOX
<P>
<P><h3>Automatic Message Tracking</h3>
 
<P>
When you select the Process Delivery, Read, And Recall Receipts On Arrival
and Delete Receipts And Blank Responses After Processing check boxes on the
E-mail tab of the Options dialog box (Tools menu), you receive notification
messages in your Inbox for messages you track. Outlook may require 30 to 60
seconds of idle time on your computer to process the notification message,
at which time it deletes the notification message from your Inbox and
automatically records it on the Tracking tab of your original message.
<P>
Notification messages are processed automatically only from the Inbox. The
message you send is updated only if it has not been moved from the folder
where you keep copies of sent messages (by default, the Sent Items folder).
<P>
<P><h3>Changing and Removing an E-mail AutoSignature You Use with WordMail</h3>
 
<P>
To change an AutoSignature you use with WordMail, perform the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the text box of a message, type and format the text you want to
   use as the new AutoSignature.

<P><LI>Select the text you just created.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click AutoSignature.

<P><LI>To add a blank line above the AutoSignature, select the Add Blank
   Line Prior To AutoSignature check box.
<P>
</OL>To remove an AutoSignature you use with WordMail, perform the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click in the text box of a message. Make sure no text is selected.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click AutoSignature.

<P><LI>Click Yes to delete the current default e-mail AutoSignature.
<P>
</OL><h3>Using Print Preview and WordMail</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot view a message in print preview when you use WordMail.
Additionally, when you use WordMail as your e-mail editor, the Page Setup
and the Print dialog boxes are the Word dialog boxes, not the Outlook
dialog boxes. Note that you can use print preview for other items in
Outlook, such as appointments or tasks, when you use WordMail.
<P>
<P><h3>Using WordMail Templates</h3>
 
<P>
There are six custom e-mail templates and one blank e-mail template you can
use when you select Word as your e-mail editor in Microsoft Outlook or
Microsoft Exchange. (Some Help topics state that there are ten e-mail
templates available.)
<P>
<P><h3>Using the MSN Information Service in Outlook</h3>
 
<P>
If you use MSN, The Microsoft Network as an information service in Outlook,
you must use version 4.2.5799 or later. If you use an older version, you
cannot send or receive messages.
<P>
<P><h3>Moved, Read, or Modified Items Aren't Archived as Expected</h3>
 
<P>
When you select a folder for AutoArchive, if the folder contains items you
have moved, read, or modified, the items may not be archived as expected.
This occurs because when you move, read, or modify an item, the
modification date for the item is changed to the current date, so that the
item is not as old as it was before you altered it. Items are archived
according to the date moved, read, or modified, not according to the date
created.
<P>
<P><h3>Synchronizing All Folders or Deleting an Offline Folder File (.ost) After</h3>
 
<P><h3>Disabling an Offline Folder File</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the Services dialog box in Outlook to disable an offline folder
file (.ost), the All Folders command (Tools menu, Synchronize submenu) is
still available, even though the offline folders are disabled.
Additionally, you cannot delete the offline folder file from your hard
disk. This occurs because Outlook is using the offline folder file until
you close Outlook and log off the mail server. To do this, click Exit And
Log Off on the File menu. You can now delete the .ost file from your hard
disk. When you start Outlook again, the All Folders command (Tools menu,
Synchronize submenu) is no longer available.
<P>
<P><h3>Internet Mail and MSN Information Services Are Not Available on Windows NT</h3>
 
<P><h3>Workstation 3.51</h3>
 
<P>
If you use Windows NT Workstation 3.51, Internet Mail and MSN, The
Microsoft Network information services are not available in Outlook.
<P>
<P><h3>Updating Items in Folders when You Change Where Mail is Delivered</h3>
 
<P>
If you change the location where new mail is delivered from your Mailbox
folder on a server to a personal folder file on your computer hard disk
(Delivery tab, Services command, Tools menu), the items in your Inbox on
the server are automatically downloaded to the Inbox in your personal
folder file on your hard disk. However, the items in your other folders,
such as Calendar, Tasks, and Journal, are not automatically copied to your
personal folder file. To copy these items, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the folder in your Mailbox folder on the server that you want
   to copy items from.

<P><LI>Select the items you want to copy, and then click Copy on the Edit
   menu.

<P><LI>Open the folder in your personal folder file on your hard disk that
   you want to copy the items to, and then click Paste on the Edit
   menu.
<P>
</OL>USING CALENDAR
<P>
<P><h3>Clearing Free/Busy Time After Creating a New Calendar</h3>
 
<P>
If you remove Calendar (for example, by deleting the Calendar folder in
Microsoft Exchange Client), a new Calendar is created in Outlook and the
free/busy time from the previous Calendar is not cleared. The new Calendar
does not contain the appointments from the previous Calendar; however, the
free/busy time that was bold in your previous Calendar is bold in the new
Calendar.
<P>
To clear the free/busy time in Calendar that does not represent a Calendar
item, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Close Outlook.

<P><LI>In Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation 4.0, right-click the
   shortcut for Microsoft Outlook, click Properties on the shortcut
   menu, and then click the Shortcut tab.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - In Windows NT Workstation 3.51, click the Microsoft Outlook
      program icon, and then click Properties on the File menu.
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the Target box or the Command Line box, type a space after the
   path, and then type "/cleanfreebusy" (without the quotation marks).
<P>
</OL><h3>Recurring Appointments Are Not Archived</h3>
 
<P>
When you archive items in a Calendar folder (File menu, Archive command; or
File menu, Folder submenu, Properties command, AutoArchive tab), recurring
items are not archived if any occurrences are scheduled after the archive
date. Old occurrences of a recurring item in a Calendar folder are needed
to keep track of future occurrences.
<P>
<P><h3>Printing a Shared Outlook or Schedule+ Calendar</h3>
 
<P>
When you have permission to read another person's Calendar folder but not
their Tasks folder in Outlook, you cannot view or print the TaskPad with
the Calendar. You may need to perform the following steps to print the
Calendar:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Print.

<P><LI>Click Page Setup.

<P><LI>Under Options, clear the TaskPad check box.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then click Print.
<P>
</OL>To print another person's Calendar when you use Outlook and the other
person uses Schedule+, you need the following Schedule+ print files on your
computer.

When you set up a Contacts folder to appear in the Address Book dialog box,
the folder is not added to the list of address books to be checked for
names. The Contacts folder does appear in the Show Names From The box in
the Address Book dialog box. However, the folder does not appear in the

<P>
If you switch to Outlook from Microsoft Exchange Client and decide to use
an existing user profile, the Outlook Address Book service is automatically
added to your user profile the first time you start Outlook. (The Outlook
Address Book shows e-mail names and address information of your contacts in
the Contacts folder in Outlook.) To make the Outlook Address Book

<P>
If you downloaded a beta version of Microsoft Personal Web Server onto a
computer running Microsoft Windows 95, you may have problems when you try
to drag and drop information between Microsoft Outlook 97 and other
programs. This problem occurs because you have a version of a file named
Rpcrt4.dll that is incompatible with Microsoft Outlook 97. To fix the
problem, download the QFE fix from:

</PRE></OL><h3>Finding Items and Documents Using the More Advanced Button</h3>
 
<P>
When setting search criteria for finding items or files using the Find
dialog box, if you use the same field to set multiple criteria, items that
meet one of the multiple criteria within that field are found. However, if
you use the More Advanced button (available only if you add search
extensions) on the Advanced tab to set search criteria, and you set
criteria using the same field on another tab in the Find dialog box, only
the items or files that meet all of the search criteria are found. For
example, if you set search criteria using the Importance field on the More
Choices tab, and you set search criteria using the Importance field from
the More Advanced button, only items that meet all of the search criteria
are found.
<P>
<P><h3>"Items that do not match" Search Criteria Does Not Work with Other Search</h3>
 
<P><h3>Criteria</h3>
 
<P>
If you load the Microsoft Exchange extension Emsuix.ecf and use the More
Advanced button on the Advanced tab in the Find dialog box, the Only Items
That Do Not Match These Conditions check box does not apply for other
search criteria you set in the Find dialog box. For example, if you use the
More Choices tab to set criteria to return only items that are read, and
then select the Only Items That Do Not Match These Conditions check box
using the More Advanced button, items that are read are returned instead of
items that are unread. The search criteria you set using the More Advanced
button does not work with other search criteria you set in the Find dialog
box.
<P>
<P><h3>Expected Item Isn't Returned when Searching For or Filtering Items</h3>
 
<P>
If you are searching for or filtering items and you use the name of a day
as criteria, such as messages sent on or before Sunday, Outlook returns the
items that meet the criteria for the next occurring instance of that day.
To make sure Outlook returns the items for the day you want, be as specific
as possible, such as last Sunday, tomorrow, or 2/27/97.

<P><h3>View All File Types and File Name Extensions in Windows NT Workstation 4.0</h3>
 
<P>

<P>
When you use the Find dialog box to search for files that contain certain
information (by contents), the search is much faster if you select the
specific type of file you are looking for. For example, if you are
searching for Word documents that contain the word Sales, click Documents
(*.doc) in the Of Type box in the Find dialog box before you perform the
search.
<P>
PRINTING

When you print a Help topic that contains a graphic, the graphic may not
print clearly. In particular, this occurs when you print a topic with
grayscale colors using a printer driver that does not have options to
control dithering.

<P><h3>Microsoft Office 97 Sounds Don't Work with Windows NT Workstation 3.51</h3>
 
<P>
The Office 97 sounds available in the Microsoft Office 97 ValuPack don't
work if you use Windows NT Workstation 3.51, even if the Provide Feedback
With Sound check box is selected on the General tab in the Options dialog
box (Tools menu) in the Office programs. Note that the sounds available
with the Office Assistant do work with Windows NT Workstation 3.51 if you
have selected the Make Sounds check box on the Options tab in the Office
Assistant dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office 97 ValuPack Setup May Not Be Successful Without</h3>
 
<P><h3>Administrative Permissions</h3>
 
<P>
If you use Windows NT Workstation 3.51 or later, you must be a member of
the Administrators group to install some components of the Office 97
ValuPack.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Files for The Timex Data Link Watch From a CD-ROM or a Networked</h3>
 
<P><h3>Computer</h3>
 
<P>
There are two versions of the Office 97 ValuPack Setup program that install
files for The Timex Data Link Watch. One version is for Windows 95 and
Windows NT Workstation 4.0, and the other is for Windows NT Workstation
3.51. If Outlook was installed on your computer to run from a CD-ROM or to
run from a networked computer, you must use the Windows NT Workstation 3.51
version of the Office 97 ValuPack Setup program to install files for The
Timex Data Link Watch.

IMPORTING AND EXPORTING INFORMATION
<P>
<P><h3>Field Requirements in the Map Custom Fields Dialog Box</h3>
 
<P>
When you import a file into a folder in Outlook, you can use the Map Custom
Fields dialog box to specify the fields that information is imported into.
As a minimum, you must add a field to the Mapped From column for each of
the following fields in Outlook to import the file.

<UL><LI>Mail folder: Subject field

<LI>Calendar folder: Subject, Start Date fields

<LI>Contacts folder: Any field

<LI>Tasks folder: Description (Subject) field

<LI>Notes folder: Note Body field

<LI>Journal folder: Journal Type, Start Date fields
<P>
</UL><h3>Importing Microsoft Excel 97 Data into Microsoft Outlook 97</h3>
 
<P>
When you import data from a named range of a Microsoft Excel 97 worksheet
into Outlook, the first row of the named range is imported as field names.
Outlook reserves the first row of a named range for field names (you use
field names in the Map Custom Fields dialog box in Outlook to associate
data in cells on the worksheet with the correct fields in Outlook). If the
range you import does not contain field names, the first row of data will
be interpreted as field names and will not import as data. To ensure all
the data in the named range is imported, use the first row for field names.
<P>
<P><h3>Importing Postal Codes into Outlook</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot import postal codes that include a hyphen (such as ZIP plus four
codes in the U.S.) into the Contacts folder in Outlook.
<P>
To import postal codes that start with zero, such as 02205, save the
original file in CSV format and then import the file into Outlook.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Import and Export Converters from the Microsoft Office 97</h3>
 
<P><h3>ValuPack When You Run Outlook From a CD-ROM or a Networked Computer</h3>

1.0/95; or import or export Outlook journal entries, notes, or mail
messages, even if you install converters from the Office 97 ValuPack.
<P>
If you run Outlook from a networked computer, your network administrator
must complete the following steps so that you can import information from
Symantec ACT! 2.0; NetManage ECCO Pro 3.0, 3.01, or 3.02; or Starfish
Sidekick 1.0/95; or import or export Outlook journal entries, notes, or
mail messages.

<P><h3>ECCO Pro, and Lotus Organizer Files</h3>
 
<P>
To import a Microsoft Schedule+ file, a Lotus Organizer 2.1 file, or a
NetManage ECCO Pro file into Outlook, you must have the program that was
used to create the file installed on your computer. For example, to import
an ECCO Pro file into Outlook, you must have ECCO Pro installed on your
computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Importing NetManage ECCO Pro 3.03 Files</h3>
 
<P>
The import and export converter for NetManage ECCO Pro in the Microsoft
Office 97 ValuPack supports versions 3.0, 3.01, and 3.02. To import a
NetManage ECCO Pro 3.03 file, first save the file in .csv format in ECCO
Pro 3.03. In Outlook, click Import And Export on the File menu. In the
Import And Export Wizard, select the Import From Schedule+ Or Another
Program Or File option, and then select Comma Separated Values.
<P>
<P><h3>Tasks Without Dates Are Not Imported from NetManage ECCO Pro</h3>
 
<P>
When you import a NetManage ECCO Pro file into Outlook, tasks in the ECCO
Pro To-Do list that do not have associated dates are not imported to the
Outlook task list.
<P>
<P><h3>Lotus cc:Mail Service Provider Error Message Incorrectly Refers to File</h3>
 
<P><h3>Named Cwimport.txt</h3>
 
<P>
If you use Microsoft Outlook as your e-mail client with a Lotus cc:Mail
postoffice, and if you try to import or update mail messages, you may see
an error message that refers to a file named Cwimport.txt if your system is
not set up properly. The file Cwimport.txt is not included with Microsoft
Outlook 97 or Microsoft Office 97. If you see this message, check your
network connection, and then try again. Also, try reinstalling the Lotus
cc:Mail information service from the Microsoft Office 97 ValuPack. If the
error message continues to appear, and you are sure the network is running,
and you are properly connected, and the Lotus cc:Mail information service
files are installed, your computer may not have enough free environment
space. For assistance, see your administrator.
<P>
<P><h3>Exporting Information to a Personal Address Book</h3>
 
<P>
You can export information to a Personal Address Book from Outlook. In the
Help topic File Types You Can Import To Or Export From Outlook, the entries
for Microsoft Exchange Personal Address Book should read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   File extension: .pab

</PRE></OL><h3>Mail Merge Errors in Microsoft Word 97 with Comma Separated Values</h3>
 
<P><h3>or Tab Separated Values Files Exported from Microsoft Outlook 97</h3>
 
<P>
When you export a file from Outlook as Comma Separated Values or Tab
Separated Values to use in a mail merge in Word, use the Map Custom Fields
dialog box in Outlook to select only the fields you want to export for the
mail merge. If you don't use the Map Custom Fields dialog box, you may get
unexpected results in Word.
<P>
<P><h3>Recurring Tasks and Recurring Appointments Cannot Be Exported from a</h3>
 
<P><h3>Personal Folder File</h3>
 
<P>
If you export a recurring task or a recurring appointment from a personal
folder file (that is, you keep tasks and appointments on your hard disk
instead of on a server), only the first occurrence is exported.
<P>
CREATING AND USING FORMS
<P>
<P><h3>Changing an Icon for an Outlook Form</h3>
 
<P>
If you change the icon for an Outlook Form, you must select a new icon from
a valid icon file (valid icon files typically have an .ico extension). If
you do not use a valid icon file, you won't be able to publish the form.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Outlook Forms After Running Microsoft Exchange Client Setup</h3>
 
<P>
If you run Microsoft Exchange Client Setup after installing Microsoft
Outlook, your send and reply messages may look different because the
Microsoft Exchange Client forms are registered instead of the Microsoft
Outlook forms. To avoid this problem and to be able to switch between
Microsoft Outlook Forms and Microsoft Exchange Client forms, select the
Visuals For Forms Design check box during Microsoft Outlook Setup. For more
information about how to install a component by using Setup, see Microsoft
Outlook Help.
<P>
<P><h3>Making Forms in the Organization Forms Library Available for Offline Use</h3>
 
<P>
If a message that uses a form in the Organization Forms Library is added to
the offline folder file, that form is available in the offline folder file.
However, in general, if you use an offline folder file, the forms in the
Organization Forms Library are not available when you work offline. To make
forms in the Organization Forms Library available offline, perform the
following steps to add the forms to the Personal Forms Library:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Manage Forms tab.

<P><LI>Click the Manage Forms button.

<P><LI>In the Organization Forms list, click the form you want to make
   available for offline use.

<P><LI>Click Copy.

<P><LI>In the Personal Forms list, click the form you just copied, and
   then click Properties.

<P><LI>Clear the Hidden check box.
<P>
</OL><h3>Form Field and Result Lost If Recipient Is Not Running WordMail</h3>
 
<P>
If you use WordMail as your e-mail editor and you send a message that
contains a form field, such as a drop-down list form field, neither the
form field nor the result appear if you send the message to a recipient who
is not using WordMail. To avoid losing form fields and results when you
send the form to someone who is not using WordMail, send the form as an
attached document.

MICROSOFT VISUAL BASIC SCRIPTING EDITION
<P>
<P><h3>Code Samples Do Not Run</h3>
 
<P>
The code examples in Microsoft Outlook Visual Basic Help (VbaOutl.hlp)
were written for Visual Basic for Applications. The code examples will
run in Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) with slight modifications.
To run most of the VbaOutl.hlp code examples in VBScript, replace
"CreateObject("Outlook.Application")" and
"GetObject("","Outlook.Application")" with just "Application", and replace
all built-in constants with the literal numeric values of those constants.
<P>
The following example runs in Visual Basic for Applications:
<P>
<PRE>   Set olMAPI =
   GetObject("","Outlook.Application").GetNameSpace("MAPI")
   Set myItem = olMAPI.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderTasks)

</PRE></OL>The following version of the same example runs in VBScript. (The
numeric value of the constant olFolderTasks is 13.)
<P>
<PRE>   Set olMAPI = Application.GetNameSpace("MAPI")
   Set myItem = olMAPI.GetDefaultFolder(13)

</PRE>For tables of built-in Outlook constants and their literal
numeric values, see Microsoft Outlook Constants in VbaOutl.hlp.
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to Code Examples for Events</h3>
 
<P>
In code examples for the following events in Microsoft Outlook Visual Basic
Help (VbaOutl.hlp), myItem should be Item:
<P>
<PRE>     Close Event
     Open Event
     Read Event
     Reply Event
     Send Event

</PRE>Events are only available in Visual Basic Scripting Edition.
<P>
<P><h3>Events Don't Apply to NoteItem and ReportItem Objects</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Outlook Visual Basic Help (VbaOutl.hlp), omit the NoteItem and
ReportItem objects from the list of objects events apply to.
