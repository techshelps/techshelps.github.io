<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
<LI>Microsoft Exchange clients, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows Messaging System for Windows 95 and NT 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Internet Mail and News version 1.0 for Windows 95

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides a mail attachment security add-on for its mail
clients. The mail attachment security add-on warns you before an attachment
is opened so you do not unknowingly open a malicious attachment. You
can download the add-on from the following location:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/security/mailaddon.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/security/mailaddon.htm</A></B>

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This add-on is designed for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.x users
who are running either Outlook 97, Microsoft Exchange clients versions
4.x and 5.x, or the Windows Messaging System client (the Inbox
program that ships with Windows 95 and Windows NT, 4.x).
<P>
Microsoft will distribute the attachment security add-on for Exchange
clients for Windows 3.11, Windows NT 3.51, and the Macintosh as a part of
the regularly scheduled Microsoft Exchange Server Service Pack releases.
<P>
A similar warning feature is available for the Internet Mail
and Newsgroup client by downloading and upgrading to version 3.02 of
Internet Explorer from <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com.</A></B>
<P>
The mail attachment security add-on warns you before an attachment is
opened so you don't unknowingly open a malicious attachment. While
most attachments are benign, it is possible to send programs or files
that can cause damage to your computer. You can disable or bypass the
warning for selected file types that you feel comfortable opening without
warning as well as for executable code that is signed using Authenticode.
<P>
NOTE: This add-in does not prompt for Microsoft Excel or Microsoft word
attachments and some file types, such as .exe and "unknown" file types
always give a warning and cannot be disabled.
<P>
The security add-on is a self-extracting dynamic link library (dll) file
that you can download from the Microsoft Security Advisor Web site at
<B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/security/">http://www.microsoft.com/security/.</A></B>
<P>
NOTE: Because the Microsoft Web site is constantly updated, the site
address may change without notice. If this occurs, link to the Microsoft
home page at the following address:

<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</A></B>

</PRE>Microsoft will provide localized versions of the add-on as they are
available.
<P>
When you attempt to open an attachment with the warning add-on enabled, the
following warning displays:
