<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Outlook 97, the program may stop responding to the
system. There are many possible causes for this behavior. This article
describes the most common causes and solutions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Damaged Profile</h3>
 
<P>
When you start Outlook, the program loads your selected profile. If you
have a damaged profile, you should create a new profile and try to restart
Outlook.
<P>
For additional information about troubleshooting profile problems and how
to create a new profile, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : OL97: Troubleshooting Outlook Configuration Problems

</PRE><h3>Damaged Personal Folders</h3>
 
<P>
If you suspect a damaged Personal Folders file, follow these steps to
remove the Personal Folders from your profile and to create a new Personal
Folders file:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, click to open the Mail And Fax icon. If you did not
   install fax services, you may have only a Mail icon.

<P><LI>Under the Services tab, click to select your profile, and then click
   Properties.

<P><LI>Click to select Personal Folders, and then click Remove.

<P><LI>Click Add, and in the "Available information services" box, click
   Personal Folders and OK to open the "Create/Open Personal Folders File"
   dialog box.

<P><LI>In the File Name box, type a new personal store (*.pst) file name, and
   then click Open to open your new Personal Folders properties dialog box.

<P><LI>Under the General tab, click OK to return to the Profile Properties
   dialog box.

<P><LI>Click OK and Close to close all dialog boxes.

<P>
For additional information about troubleshooting a damaged Outlook Bar,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../OUTLOOK/Q162248.htm">Q162248</A></B>
   TITLE     : OL97: Troubleshooting Outlook Bar Problems

</PRE></OL><h3>Damaged Password List</h3>
 
<P>
Delete or rename your password list file. This file is usually located in
the Windows folder with the name &lt;Username&gt;.pwl, where &lt;Username&gt; is the
name you use to log on. After you delete or rename the file, restart
Windows. The file is re-created automatically when you log on and enter
your password.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q154092.htm">Q154092</A></B>
   TITLE     : Err Msg: MPREXE Caused an Invalid Page Fault in
               Kernel32.dll

</PRE><h3>Display Driver</h3>
 
<P>
The first time Outlook starts, it tries to create the Outlook Bar. In some
instances, your video driver may prevent Outlook from creating the Outlook
Bar. You can usually work around this problem by doing one of the
following:
<P>
- Start your computer in Safe mode.
<P>
- Reduce the resolution of your current driver to VGA, 16 colors.
<P>
- Contact the manufacturer for a more recent driver.
<P>
Once Outlook has successfully started, quit Outlook, set your video display
to the desired resolution and number of colors, and then try starting
Outlook again.
<P>
<P><h3>Missing, Damaged, or Outdated Msvcrt40.dll File</h3>
 
<P>
If you recently removed or installed other software on your computer, you
may have a missing, damaged, or outdated Msvcrt40.dll file. Microsoft
Visual C++ and all Exchange clients use this file.
<P>
For additional information about issues with the Msvcrt40.dll file, please
see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCHANGE/Q152267.htm">Q152267</A></B>

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../OUTLOOK/Q162568.htm">Q162568</A></B>
   TITLE     : Invalid Page Fault in Outlrpc.dll Starting Outlook

</PRE><h3>Windows Startup Group</h3>
 
<P>
Remove all programs from the Windows Startup group and restart your
computer. You may experience conflicts from other programs running at the
same time that Outlook is starting. Once Outlook successfully starts the
first time, you may be able to return to your original Startup group
configuration with Outlook.
