The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to carry out any file action (Save, Open, or Print) in a
Microsoft Office 97 program or in a Visual Basic for Applications program,
the program may appear to stop responding. This occurs while Microsoft
Outlook 97 is busy performing an action that takes a long time, such as
synchronizing an Offline Folders File (*.ost), autoarchiving, or exporting.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur when all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You started Outlook before you started the Office 97 program that is not
   responding.

<LI>You have the option to "Automatically record these items" in the Journal
   selected for the Office program that is not responding.

<LI>Outlook is busy with another action.
<P>
</UL>Under these circumstances, the file action of the Office program triggers a
request to write to the Journal. Writing to the Journal must wait until
Outlook becomes available. The file action of the Office program cannot
proceed until the Journal entry is complete.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are three ways to avoid this behavior:

<UL><LI>Start the Office program before you start Outlook.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Wait until Outlook finishes whatever action is keeping it busy before
   beginning any file action in another Office program.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Turn off the option to "Automatically record these items" in the Journal
   for the Office program that is not responding.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Outlook Journal automatically records a log of user activities. Each
Office 97 program provides AutoJournal capabilities, logging to an Outlook
Journal entry each time you open, save, or print a document. With the
Journal and the Outlook 97 Timeline view, you can find information based on
when you worked on a document, and not worry about where you saved it or
what you named it. To configure Outlook 97 to use the AutoJournal feature,
use the Journal tab on the Options dialog box. With this, you can add,
remove, and edit, the types of AutoJournal entries.
<P>
If you start Outlook first and have the Outlook AutoJournal feature
selected for any of the Office 97 programs, Outlook tries to record the
Office program's activities directly to the Outlook Journal. If Outlook is
busy with another action, the Journal entry must wait for Outlook to become
available. During this wait, the Office 97 program is unable to complete
its file action and appears to stop responding.
<P>
NOTE: This behavior is different in Outlook version 8.02; file actions do
not wait on Journal actions in version 8.02. For more information about
Outlook version 8.02, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A HREF="../OUTLOOK/Q166022.htm">Q166022</A></B>
   Title     : OL97: Summary of Changes in Outlook Version 8.02

</PRE>If you start the Office 97 program first and have the Outlook AutoJournal
feature selected, the Office program makes a call to the Mso97.dll file
that causes the Journal entry to write to the Offitems.log file in the
Windows folder. The Journal processes these entries after a Messaging
Application Programming Interface (MAPI) idle time of 30 seconds. In this
situation, the Office program passes off the Journal entry that the file
action triggered, even if Outlook is busy. The Office program does not have
to wait on Outlook. When Outlook becomes available, the Journal action
proceeds.
