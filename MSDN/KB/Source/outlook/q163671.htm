The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you delete a folder from Microsoft Outlook 97, it becomes a subfolder
to the Deleted Items folder.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the right mouse button (right click) to click a folder on the
Folder List, and then click "Delete '&lt;foldername&gt;'" on the menu that
appears, the items are not sent to the Deleted Items Folder. Rather, the
folder being deleted becomes a subfolder to the Deleted Items Folder in the
current store. Right-clicking the Deleted Items folder and clicking "Empty
<PRE>'Deleted Items' Folder" on the menu that appears permanently deletes the
</PRE>folder and its contents.
<P>
To reproduce this behavior, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, point to New, and then click Folder.

<P><LI>Type "Test" (without the quotation marks) in the Name box. Under "Make
   this folder a subfolder of," click your primary store folder set or
   any Personal Folders set, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Create or copy some items to the Test folder.

<P><LI>Right-click the Test folder, and click "Delete 'Test'".
<P>
</OL>Note that the Test folder becomes a subfolder to the Deleted Items folder
in the current store. The items are still contained in the Test folder and
not the Deleted Items folder.
<P>
If you right-click the Deleted Items folder and click "Empty 'Deleted
Items' Folder," the Test subfolder and its contents are permanently
removed.
