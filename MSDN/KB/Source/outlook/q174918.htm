<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you run Novell GroupWise and Microsoft Outlook 97 on the same computer,
they must have different user profiles and must not be open at the same
time.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
GroupWise and Outlook use the same Windows messaging profile service but
they cannot successfully share the same profile, and they cannot be open at
the same time.
<P>
Before installing GroupWise, select the Outlook option to "Prompt for a
profile to be used."
<P>
<P><h3>Selecting the Option to Prompt for a Profile</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu click, Options.

<P><LI>On the General tab click to select, "Prompt for a profile to be used"
   and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>After installing GroupWise, check the user profiles to make sure a separate
profile was created for GroupWise; if it was not, manually create a
separate profile. Since GroupWise does not have the option to prompt for a
profile, the default profile must be set to start GroupWise.
<P>
<P><h3>Adjusting the User Profiles</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel double-click the Mail and Fax icon.

<P><LI>On the Service tab click, Show Profiles.

<P><LI>If a new profile was not created for GroupWise follow these steps:
<P>
   a. On the General tab, click Copy.
<P>
   b. Type a name for the GroupWise profile and click OK.
<P>
   c. Click to select the Outlook profile and then click Properties.
<P>
   d. On the Services tab click to select each non-Outlook service,
      click Remove, and then click OK.
<P>
   e. Click to select the GroupWise profile and then click Properties.
<P>
   f. On the Services tab click to select each non-GroupWise service,
      click Remove, and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the General tab, set the default profile by clicking to select the
    GroupWise profile from the "When starting Microsoft Windows messaging,
    use this" list and then click Close.
<P>
</OL>Result: When starting GroupWise, the default profile setting from step 4
above will be used.  When starting Outlook, you will be prompted to choose
a profile. GroupWise will be displayed as the default in the Profile Name
window so you must click to select the Outlook profile from the list in the
Choose Profile dialog box.
<P>
GroupWise is manufactured by Novell, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
