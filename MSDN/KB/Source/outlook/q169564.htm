The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you print items in Microsoft Outlook 97 using the Memo style, a name
is automatically printed at the top of the page. There are no options in
Outlook Page Setup to allow you to omit or change the name.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The name that Outlook prints at the top of an item when using the Memo
style is the name used in your e-mail service in the Outlook Profile.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you do not want a name to appear at the top of your printed item, create
a profile that does not contain an e-mail service, but uses your current
Personal Folders file.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: If you have your e-mail delivered to a Microsoft Exchange Server
   and also store your Contacts, Calendar, Journal, Tasks, and Notes
   folders on the Exchange Server, the following method will not work.

</PRE><h3>To Determine Your Personal Folders File Location and Name</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>Click Personal Folders, then click Properties.

<P><LI>Make a note of the path information. This is the location and file name
   of your Personal Folders file.

<P><LI>Click OK to exit the Personal Folders Properties, then OK to exit
   Services.
<P>
</OL><h3>To Create a New Profile</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If Outlook is open, click Exit and Log Off on the File menu.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Mail and Fax. (If you do not have Fax services installed,
   this will appear as Mail, not Mail and Fax.)

<P><LI>Click Show Profiles, then click Add to start the Inbox Setup Wizard.

<P><LI>Click to select "Use the following information services", select all the
   services in your current profile except e-mail, then click Next.
<P>
   NOTE: If you have no services selected, click "Manually configure
   information services", then click Next.

<P><LI>Type a unique name for the profile, such as NoMail, then click Next.

<P><LI>Type the requested information as you step through the Inbox Setup
   Wizard.
<P>
   NOTE: If you selected no services in Step 5, you must add either the
   Personal Address Book or the Personal Folders service to create a
   profile.

<P><LI>Click Finish when you reach the end of the wizard.

<P><LI>On the General tab under "When starting Microsoft Windows Messaging, use
   this profile", select the "NoMail" profile in the list, click Close,
   then close the Control Panel and start Outlook.
<P>
</OL>When you print an item using the Memo style, no name will print at the top
of the page.
<P>
<P><h3>To Print Another Name at the Top of the Printed Item</h3>
 
<P>
If you want another user's name to appear at the top of your printed item,
create a profile that contains an Internet Mail service with the user's
name in the Your full name box.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: If you have your e-mail delivered to a Microsoft Exchange Server
   and also store your Contacts, Calendar, Journal, Tasks, and Notes
   folders on the Exchange Server, the following method will not work.

</PRE><P><LI>Determine your Personal Folders file location and name. See the above
    topic, "To Determine Your Personal Folders File Location and Name."

    Internet Mail, then click Next.

<P><LI>Type a unique name for the profile, such as FakeMail, then click Next.

    Wizard. When asked for settings in Internet Mail, it is not necessary 
<PRE>    to type in valid settings, but you must type at least one character.     
When prompted for Your full name in the Internet Mail configuration,         
type the user's name that you want to appear at the top of the printed     
</PRE></OL>item.
