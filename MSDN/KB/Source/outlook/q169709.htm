<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how you can copy or move your Personal Address Book
(PAB)from one computer to another.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook stores your Personal Address Book information in a PAB file.
Copying your PAB file to a second computer is a three-step process.

<UL><LI>Identify the PAB file that your mail profile uses.
<LI>Copy the PAB file to the second computer.
<LI>Set the profile on your second computer to reference the copied PAB
   file.
<P>
</UL><h3>Identify the PAB File Your Mail Profile Uses</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Outlook.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>On the Services tab, click to select Personal Address Book and then
   click Properties.

<P><LI>Note the path to your PAB file. For example, C:\Exchange\Mailbox.pab
   indicates a Personal Address Book named Mailbox.pab located in the
   Exchange folder on the C drive.

<P><LI>Click OK and OK to close all dialog boxes, and then Exit and Log Off
   of Outlook.
<P>
</OL>Copy the PAB File to a Second Computer
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit all mail programs.

<P><LI>Use the Windows Explorer to locate and copy the PAB file from Step 4
   above to a disk and then to the second computer.
<P>
   For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see
   your Windows printed documentation or online Help.
   
   NOTE: You can save the PAB file in any directory on the destination
   computer as long as you remember the location.
   
</OL><h3>Configure Your Second Computer to Use the New PAB File</h3>
 
<P>
To make the new PAB active on the second computer, you can add the copied
PAB file to your profile using these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Outlook.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services.
<P>
   NOTE: If your Profile Services dialog box does not list a Personal
   Address Book skip Step 3 below.
 
<P><LI>On the Services tab, click to select Personal Address Book and
   click Remove.

<P><LI>On the Services tab, click Add to open "Add Service to Profile"

<P><LI>In the Available information services list, click to select Personal
   Address Book, and then click OK.

<P><LI>In the Path box, type the path to your PAB file and click OK until all
   dialog boxes close.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Exit and Log Off.

<P><LI>Restart Outlook. Your new Personal Address Book should now be available.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: There is no method for merging one Personal Address Book file with
another. By using the Outlook Import and Export Wizard, you can merge the
active Personal Address Book entries into your Contacts folder.
<P>
For information about importing a Personal Address Book into your
Contacts folder, type "import" in the Office Assistant, click Search, and
then click to view "Import a Personal Address Book into a Contacts folder."
