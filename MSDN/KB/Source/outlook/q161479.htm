SUMMARY
 
<P>
In Microsoft Outlook 97, you can look a Contact up, based on a resolved
e-mail address. Outlook will use the e-mail address and try to find a match
in your primary Contacts folder; however, Outlook will not look for a match
in any Contact subfolders.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This feature, known as Look Up Contact, enables you to quickly move from an
e-mail address in a message to the associated Contact for that e-mail
address.
<P>
To use the Look Up Contact feature:

<OL><P><LI>Using the right mouse button, click a resolved e-mail address in a mail
   message.

<P><LI>On the shortcut menu, click Look Up Contact.
<P>
</OL>When Outlook attempts to match the e-mail address with a contact, it only
looks at the contacts in your primary Contacts folder. Although you can
create Contact folders in other places, for performance reasons, Outlook
will not attempt to match the e-mail name to those Contacts.
<P>
The primary Contacts folder is the Contacts folder that is located in the
same folder as the Inbox to which mail is delivered.
<P>
To locate your primary Contacts folder:

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Folder List.

<P><LI>On the Go menu, click Contacts. In the Folder list, note which Contacts
   folder is selected.
<P></OL>
