<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open the "Welcome to Microsoft Outlook!" message that is generated
the first time you run Outlook 97, you may receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you may receive an error message similar to the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   Winword caused an invalid page fault in module mso97.dll

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Your system's video driver and video settings may contribute to this
problem when using Word as your e-mail editor in Outlook. This problem is
more likely to occur with video drivers that support only 16 colors.
<P>
This problem is known to occur with an ATI Graphics Ultra Pro (Mach 32)
video driver with the video options set to 1024x768 resolution with 16
colors.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.

<UL><LI>Delete the welcome message without reading it.

<LI>To read the message, disable WordMail as your e-mail editor.

<LI>Switch to the standard VGA video driver.

<LI>Set the video driver to use more than 16 colors.
<P>
</UL><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
You can delete the welcome message without reading it by following these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Outlook Bar, click the Inbox.

<P><LI>Click the header of the welcome message: "Welcome to Microsoft
   Outlook!" to select it.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Delete.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
To read the message with out receiving the error, you can disable WordMail
by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Outlook.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>On the e-mail tab, clear the "Use Microsoft Word as the Email
   Editor" check box, and then click Close.

<P><LI>Open the welcome message.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
Switch to the standard VGA video driver supplied with Windows. For more
information on changing a video driver, look in the Windows 95 Help Index
under "display, driver, adding or changing".
<P>
<P><h3>Method 4</h3>
 
<P>
If your video driver supports more than 16 colors, you may help to avoid
the error by setting the driver to use a greater number of colors. For more
information on changing a video driver, look in the Windows 95 Help Index
under "display, resolution, changing".
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook 97.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>

of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
