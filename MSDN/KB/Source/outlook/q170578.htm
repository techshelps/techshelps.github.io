<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using the Meeting Planner in Outlook, Details of appointments marked
Private can be viewed by others who have been given Read pemission.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook 8.0. This
problem was corrected in Microsoft Outlook version 8.01.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When using the Meeting Planner in Outlook, it is possible to see the free
and busy times of those you are inviting to a meeting. You can view the
details of the blocks of time someone is busy by right-clicking that time
period. You can prevent others from being able to view the details of an
appointment by setting the appointment as private. Version 8.0 of Outlook
enables others who have been given at least Read permission to view your
private appointments.
