<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Microsoft Outlook 97 with the Microsoft Exchange Server
Information Service, you have the ability to work with folders "offline"
that is, you can access the contents of a folder without a network
connection, which is beneficial for remote users. This article discusses
how you can change from using Personal Folders to Offline Folders, and how
to create, use, and synchronize offline folders.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Personal Folders are folders that you create to store mail messages on your
local hard disk or on another server. You add a main Personal Folders as a
service to the User Profile and give it a file name. Personal Folders have
a .PST extension.
<P>

</PRE><P>
   Click Yes to copy/replace the folder design properties.
<P>
</OL><h3>Offline Folders</h3>
 
<P>
Offline folders are stored in an offline folder file (OST); this file is
located on your computer and is available even when the network is down.
The default location for the OST is your current Windows folder. Like
Personal Folders (PST), the OST can be compacted to save space on your
computer.
<P>
The difference between an Offline Folder file and a set of Personal Folders
is the Offline Folder file starts as a mirror image of your folders on the
Microsoft Exchange Server and works in conjunction with it during
synchronization. A set of Personal Folders, on the other hand, is simply a
storage location on your local disk or on a server other than the Microsoft
Exchange Server.
<P>
When working offline, you can add, delete, and modify the contents of an
offline folder exactly as you do with a folder on a server. For example,
you can change and move items in your offline Inbox, send messages that are
placed in your offline Outbox, and read your offline public folders. In the
meantime, information on the server is still processing. You will continue
to receive new messages in your Mailbox while other users can add, delete,
and change items in public folders. However, you will not be aware of these
changes on the server until you connect to the network.
<P>
When you need to update the contents of the Offline folder and its
corresponding server folder so that they are identical, you synchronize the
folders and then continue to work offline. The Synchronize command on the
Tools menu connects to the server through Dial-Up Networking, copies the
changes made in each folder to the other folder, and then disconnects. An
item that you delete from either the offline folder or the corresponding
server folder will be deleted from both after synchronization.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating an Offline Folder File</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: You must be connected to the Microsoft Exchange Server for the
initial creation and synchronization of the Offline Folder file.
<P>
To create an offline folder file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>Click to select Microsoft Exchange Server, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>On the Advanced tab, click Offline Folder File Settings.

<P><LI>In the Offline Folder File Settings, type the path to the file
   you want to use as the offline folder file.

<P><LI>If the message, "&lt;path&gt;&lt;filename&gt;.ost could not be
   found. Would you like to create it?" appears, click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK and OK.
<P>
</OL>All of the standard Outlook folders (Inbox, Outbox, Deleted Items, Sent
Items, Calendar, Contacts, Journal, Notes, and Tasks) on the Microsoft
Exchange Server are now ready for offline use. You cannot selectively
choose which will be available for offline use and which will not be
available. The exceptions to this are Public Folders and any user-defined
folders. To set Public Folders for offline use, see the "Working with
Public Folders Offline" section.
<P>
To set any user defined folders for offline use, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Right-click the user-defined folder and click Properties.

<P><LI>On the Synchronization tab and click to select "When offline or online"
   from the "This folder is available."

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You cannot use an OST file that has previously been used with a
different mailbox. Doing so produces the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The file &lt;filename&gt;.ost cannot be accessed because it
   has been configured for use with a different mailbox.

</PRE></OL><h3>Working with Public Folders Offline</h3>
 
<P>
To work with public folders offline, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Using the right mouse button (right-click), click the public folder that
   you want to work with, and click Copy "&lt;FolderName&gt;" on the shortcut
   menu.

<P><LI>In the Copy Folder dialog box, move to your Favorites Folder, and click
   OK.

<P><LI>From your Favorites Folder, right-click the newly copied folder, and
   click Properties on the shortcut menu.

<P><LI>Click the Synchronization Tab and select the "When Offline or online"
   option under "This folder is available."

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>Your Public Folder is now ready for offline use. Each folder that you copy
to your Favorites Folder can now be selectively set for offline use.
<P>
<P><h3>To Synchronize Offline Folders</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: When you synchronize, a log file appears as a message in your Deleted
Items folder. This log file contains information such as the time you
synchronized, the names of the folders synchronized, and the number of
items added.
<P>
<P><h3>Synchronizing a Specific Folder</h3>
 
<P>
To synchronize a specific folder, click the folder you want to synchronize,
click Synchronize on the Tools menu, and then click This Folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Synchronizing All Folders</h3>
 
<P>
To synchronize all your offline folders, on the Tools Menu, click
Synchronize and then click All Folders.
<P>
<P><h3>Automatically Synchronizing All Folders When You Quit Outlook</h3>
 
<P>
To automatically synchronize all folders when you quit Outlook:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, Click Options.

<P><LI>On the General Tab click to select "When online, synchronize all folders
   upon exiting."

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>All folders which are set to be available while offline will now be
automatically synchronized when you quit Outlook. It is important to
Synchronize and download the Address book before you log off from your
Microsoft Exchange Server when going on the road. This is particularly
important when going on the road for the first time. This will ensure that
all your offline folders will be updated before you leave.
<P>
To download your address book, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Synchronize and select Download Address
   Book.

<P><LI>Select to either Download the offline address book with or without
   details information and click OK.
<P>
</OL>Read the information concerning the ramifications of downloading without
detail information.
<P>
NOTE: The Outlook Remote Mail feature is not available if you are set for
Offline Folder Use. For more detailed information about Remote Mail and
how to use it, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
