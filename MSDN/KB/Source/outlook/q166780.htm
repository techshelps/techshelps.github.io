<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes why Microsoft Outlook 97 provides the following
security warning when you open an item.
<P>
<PRE>   The form for this item has not been registered in this folder...

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook always prompts you before opening an item that contains VBScript,
if the item is from an unknown source. Outlook bases the decision to
display or not display a warning on the item's form design.

<UL><LI>If the form that the item is based on is registered in one of Exchange's
   forms registries (organizational forms, folder, or personal forms),
   Outlook considers the form safe, and no warning appears. The author of
   the form had the appropriate privileges to publish the form, so the form
   is considered trusted.
<P>
   Note: If you use a custom Appointment form, it is impossible to suppress
   the warning. Recipients of a Meeting Request are prompted twice when
   they open a Meeting Request in their Inbox. In general, Appointment
   forms are relatively complex because Outlook "oversees" the entire
   meeting request process. An Appointment form spawns a Meeting Request
   form, sets the message class of the form to
   IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Request, and attaches the VBScript code to this
   "internal" form. Since this internal form is not really published, it is
   not considered secure and will generate the warning. Outlook's
   IPM.Schedule forms cannot be customized or published and therefore there
   is no way to avoid the warning from being displayed.

<LI>If the form definition is carried with the item (the author modified the
   form and sent it, without publishing it in one of the form registries),
   Outlook considers the form unsafe, and the user receives a warning when
   opening the item.
<P>
</UL>This methodology ensures that unsafe VBScript cannot run on a your
computer, without your knowledge and explicit approval.
