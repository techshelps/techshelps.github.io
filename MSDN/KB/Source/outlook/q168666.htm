The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When launching Microsoft Outlook 97, you may receive one or more of the
following messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to open your default mail folders. Outlook could not start
   Because a location to send and receive mail could not be found. To add
   a location, such as a personal folder file, double-click the Mail icon
   in Windows Control Panel

   -or-

   Unable to open your default mail folders. The path specified for the
   file &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;filename&gt;.pst is not valid.

</PRE>The above messages are then followed by:
<P>
<PRE>   Would you like to open your default File System folder instead?

</PRE>Other network related messages may follow the initial two messages
above, however, the last message listed above will always appear.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors are likely to occur if you are using Internet Mail, CompuServe
Mail, or The Microsoft Network online service, and one of the following
problems exists:

<UL><LI>No Personal Folder file (.pst) exists in your mail profile.

<LI>Your Personal Folder file where your mail is delivered is located on a
   server that is currently unavailable.

<LI>Your Personal Folder file where your mail is delivered is corrupted and
   can not be opened.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>No PST in Your Mail Profile</h3>
 
<P>
To add a personal Folder file to your mail profile, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>On the Services tab, click Add.

<P><LI>In the Available Information Services box, select Personal Folders and
   click OK.

<P><LI>Specify the file name and location for your personal folder file and
   click Open.

<P><LI>In the Name box, enter a name for the personal folder file.

<P><LI>Select the options you want and click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK and restart Outlook.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If the problem persists, restart Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Personal Folder File Located on a Network Server</h3>
 
<P>
Contact your system administrator to check the availability of the network
server where your Personal Folder file is located.
<P>
<P><h3>Corrupted Personal Folder File</h3>
 
<P>
If you suspect that your personal folder file is corrupted, you may be able
to recover the file using the Inbox Repair Tool.
<P>
To run the Inbox Repair tool, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories,
   point to System Tools, and click Inbox Repair Tool.

<P><LI>Specify the name of the .pst file you want to repair, or click
   Browse to browse for the .pst file. The default location for the
   .pst file is the C:\Exchange folder.

<P><LI>Click Start.
<P>
</OL>If an error is encountered, you are given the option make a backup of the
file before the repair is attempted.
<P>
The log file for the repair process has the same name as the .pst file,
with a .log extension. So, if you repair a file named Mailbox.pst,
the log file is named Mailbox.log.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook needs a personal folders file to store your mail messages,
Calendar, Contacts, and Tasks. If Outlook is unable to find a personal
folder file, the only other folders that can be opened are the File System
Folders because Outlook can be used as a Document Explorer. For more
information on the Document Explorer feature, see the section  "Viewing
File System Folders in Outlook" below.
<P>
This does not occur if you are using Microsoft Exchange Server or Microsoft
Mail as your mail system because these mail systems can always display your
MailBox, which is the top level of your server folders on the Microsoft
Exchange Server, or the top level of Shared Folders on the Mail Server.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Viewing File System Folders in Outlook</h3>
 
<P>
To view or open any of the files on your computer as well as on any network
drive you are connected to, click the Other group on the Outlook Bar, and
then click My Computer. You can view files as icons, in a table, or on a
timeline. When you view files in a table, you can display file properties
such as the author, date created, or file type, and you can sort or group
files by any of these properties.
<P>
When you view files, you can quickly open, copy, move, print, or delete
files, and you can create shortcuts to your files. You can also connect to
a network drive or disconnect a network drive from any folder.
