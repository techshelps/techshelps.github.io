The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you add custom properties to a Microsoft Office document and post the
document to a personal Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)
folder in Microsoft Outlook 97 using the "Send To Exchange Folder" command,
or by dragging the document to an MAPI folder, Outlook does not display the
custom property names in the Field Chooser.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two methods to resolve this problem depending on how you posted
the document to the Outlook folder.

<UL><LI>If you used the "Send To Exchange Folder" command in an Office program,
   follow the steps in the "Send To Exchange Folder" section.

<LI>If you dragged the document to the Outlook folder, follow the steps in
   the "Use the Find Fast Indexer" section. The steps in the "Send To
   Exchange Folder" section will also resolve the problem.
<P>
</UL><h3>Send To Exchange Folder</h3>
 
<P>
Use this method for the first document that contains the custom properties.
For subsequent documents containing the same custom properties, you can use
the "Send To Exchange Folder" command in Office programs such as Microsoft
Word or Microsoft Excel.
<P>
Save the file to a folder and drag it from the file system folder to an
Outlook personal folder.

<OL><P><LI>When your document is complete, save it to a folder in the file
   system, such as My Documents, close the file, and minimize the
   program.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, click Windows Explorer and
   then size and position the window on the right half of your monitor.

<P><LI>Start Outlook and size and position it on the left half of your monitor.

<P><LI>Locate the file in Windows Explorer; using the right mouse button,
   drag the file to a personal folder in the Outlook window. Release the
   mouse button and click Copy on the shortcut menu.

<P><LI>On the View menu in Outlook, click Field Chooser, then click to select
   "User-defined fields in folder" from the list box.
<P>
</OL>For all subsequent documents with the same custom properties you can use
the "Send To Exchange Folder" command.
<P>
<P><h3>Use the Find Fast Indexer</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Find Fast Indexer to create an index of the folder containing the
Office documents that you dragged to the Outlook folder. You can specify
the file types to index only when you create an index. You cannot change
the indexed file types for an existing index; you must delete the index and
then recreate it.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating an Index</h3>
 
<P>
To create a Fast Find index, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Find Fast, and on the Index menu, click Create Index.

<P><LI>Click Browse and click to select the drive or folder containing the
   documents you want to index. This location is also where the index files
   are stored.

<P><LI>Under Of Type, click to select from the list, the file types you want to
   index.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Deleting an Index</h3>
 
<P>
To delete a Fast Find index, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Find Fast and on the Index menu, click Delete Index.

<P><LI>Click Browse and click to select the drive or folder containing the
   index you want to delete.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>

Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
