The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Timex Data Link Watch produced by Timex Corporation receives
information exported from Microsoft Outlook 97. The Timex Data Link Watch
Wizard in Outlook makes it easy to export appointments, tasks, phone
numbers, anniversaries, reminders, and current time and time zone
information to the watch.
<P>
To export information to your Data Link Watch, you must know which model
you have. There may be no model number on the watch itself. The simple
visual difference is in the material used for the case. The Timex Data Link
Watch Model 100 case is made of lightweight resin. This is shown as Timex
Data Link Watch in the Wizard. The cases for Models 150 and 150s are made
of metal.
<P>
Another way to determine the model you have is by identifying a number
imprinted on the watch caseback. The code is located near the bottom of the
caseback. The codes for the various models are:
<P>
<PRE>   786     Model 70    Timex Data Link Watch (supported in Outlook only
                       with version 2.1d of the Datalink software,
                       available from the Timex Web site, below)
   2025NA  Model 100   Timex Data Link Watch
   802     Model 150   Timex Data Link 150 Watch
   763     Model 150s  Timex Data Link 150s Watch
   816     No Model #  Ironman Triathlon with Data Link Watch
                       (not supported in Outlook)

</PRE>An additional method is to put the watch in COMM MODE. To do this press the
MODE BUTTON (middle button on the right side of the watch) repeatedly,
until the watch displays "COMM MODE". The watch display will change
momentarily and show one of the following examples:
<P>
<PRE>   Model 100    --------
               |  comm  |
               | ------ |
               | READY  |
               |        |
                --------

   Model 150    --------
               |  comm  |
               | ------ |
               | READY  |
               |  v2.0  |
                --------

   Model 150s   --------
               |  comm  |
               | ------ |
               | READY  |
               |  v2.1  |
                --------

have 3 additional options in the Export Wizard:

<UL><LI>Data Link Device Type 2

<P>
</UL>Data Link Device Type 2 will work for the Tiger PDA2000 Organizer and
future devices that use this same transfer mode. Royal FL90/95 Organizer
users can choose either Databank Type or Royal FL90/95 Organizers.
<P>
