The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how you can use the Microsoft Outlook 97 Import and
Export Wizard to import text data into Outlook and export Outlook data to a
text file.
<P>
Use of a text file is helpful when the converters provided with Outlook do
not directly match the format of the other program. Most programs can
export and import text files, so you can often use a text file as a common
file format for exporting and importing data with Outlook.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook's Import and Export Wizard can import and export the following
types of text data:
<P>
<PRE>   Comma Separated Values (MS-DOS)
   Comma Separated Values (Windows)
   Tab Separated Values (MS-DOS)
   Tab Separated Values (Windows)

</PRE><h3>MS-DOS Versus Windows</h3>
 
<P>
You should make the decision to use the MS-DOS or Windows converter based
on the text character set used in your data. ASCII is a character set used
by many MS-DOS programs, and ANSI is a character set used by many Windows
programs. The largest difference between ASCII and ANSI are the upper 128
characters; the lower 128 characters are the same. The upper 128 characters
are often referred to as extended characters. ASCII extended characters
include line draw characters while ANSI extended characters include
international characters and publishing symbols.
<P>
<P><h3>Comma Versus Tab</h3>
 
<P>
The character used to separate (delimit) each field in your data determines
if you use the comma or tab separated converter. If you open your data in
Microsoft Word 97 and see commas between each field, then your data is
comma separated. Comma separated values are sometimes referred to as a CSV
file. If rather than commas you see space between the fields, then your
data is either tab separated or uses a fixed width field. Outlook's tab
separated converter looks for a tab character between fields. In Word 97
you can select the Show/Hide option; tabs appear as arrows that point to
the right, and space characters appear as small dots.
<P>
NOTE: Do not save your file as a Word document, since Word uses a different
file format.
<P>
<P><h3>Importing Text Data</h3>
