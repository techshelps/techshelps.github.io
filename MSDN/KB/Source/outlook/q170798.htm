<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When saving an attachment file in Microsoft Outlook 97, you may get the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't create file:  &lt;Long File Named File -- ONLY LFN&gt; Right-click
   the folder you want to create the file in, and then click Properties
   on the Shortcut menu to check your permissions for the folder.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The attachment file has a long file name and the volume, or hard disk on
which you have your Temp folder does not support long file names.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Move your Temp folder to a volume that supports long file names.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
During the save process, Outlook creates a temporary file of the attachment
in your Temp folder. This file will have a name at least as long as the
attachment name so the Temp folder must support long file names.
<P>
