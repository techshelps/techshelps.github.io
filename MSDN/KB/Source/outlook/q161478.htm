<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOM</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Outlook 97, after you make an appointment in your active
Calendar, other people may not immediately see that time as busy.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are three possible causes for this behavior:

<UL><LI>By default, Outlook updates your free/busy time every 15 minutes. If the
   update is not complete, others will not see your appointment as busy
   time.

<LI>Outlook publishes your free/busy time for only the next three
   months. If your appointment is beyond the published limit, others will
   not see your appointment as busy time.

<LI>If the appointment Show Time As property is set to Free, others will
   not see your appointment as busy time.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If the cause is how often Outlook updates free/busy time, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options to open the Options dialog box.

<P><LI>In the Options dialog box, click the Calendar tab, and then click the
   Advanced Scheduling button to open the Advanced Scheduling dialog box.

<P><LI>In the "Update free/busy information on the server every &lt;15&gt; minutes"
   box, type how often you want the server to update.

<P><LI>Click OK and then OK again.
<P>
</OL>If the cause is how far ahead Outlook publishes free/busy time, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options to open the Options dialog box.

<P><LI>In the Options dialog box, click the Calendar tab, and then click the
   Advanced Scheduling button to open the Advanced Scheduling dialog box.

<P><LI>In the "Publish &lt;3&gt; month(s) of Calendar free/busy information on the
   server" box, type how far ahead you want the server to publish free/busy
   time.

<P><LI>Click OK and then OK again.
<P>
</OL>If the cause is that the Appointment Show Time As property is not set to
Free, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click to open your appointment.

<P><LI>Click the Appointment tab.

<P><LI>In the Show Time As list, click Busy or Out Of Office to indicate that
   you are not available during the appointment.
