</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Outlook 97, the CompuServe Mail information service can be
used without the CompuServe software. This article discusses
the configuration properties of the CompuServe Mail information
service.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can install the CompuServe Mail information service for use with
Outlook even though you do not have the CompuServe software installed
on your computer. Additionally, CompuServe Mail is TAPI (Telephony
Application Programming Interface) compliant and dials directly to your
modem to call the CompuServe network, so a Windows 95 Dialup Networking
connection is not required.
<P>
For information on obtaining and installing CompuServe Mail, please refer
to the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge base:

<P>
<P><h3>CompuServe Mail Configuration</h3>
 
<P>
The CompuServe Mail Properties contain four tabs:
<P>
<P><h3>General</h3>
 
<P>
This tab contains information specific to your CompuServe account. Items
such as your Name, CompuServe ID, and your password reside here. All
information in this tab is required except for your password. If you leave
your password blank, Outlook will prompt you for your password each
time you start Outlook.
<P>
<P><h3>Connection</h3>
 
<P>
This tab contains information on your connection. Items such as the
CompuServe Access telephone number, which modem to use, and Winsock
settings.
<P>
Phone Number:
<P>
Enter the telephone number you use to access CompuServe.
<P>

       the phone number in the following format:

      +c (aaa) xxx-yyyy
      |    |      |_____________ phone number
