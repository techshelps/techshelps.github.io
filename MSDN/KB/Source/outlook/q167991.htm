<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The field containing the date and time an e-mail message was received may
be incorrect.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Outlook, when viewing the header of an e-mail message, one of the fields
typically displayed is the date and time the message was received. An e-
mail server stamps the date and time an e-mail message is received as it is
processed. The date and time information is stored in a read-only Outlook
field called "PR_Delivery_Time." This field may contain incorrect
information if the e-mail server is not set to the correct date and time or
if the format of the date and time on the server is in a non-standard
format.
<P>
If the date and time are correctly set on the server, but the e-mail you
receive displays incorrect date and time information, then the date and
time format on the server may be incompatible with Outlook. In this case,
you must look at the date and time the message was sent instead of the time
it was received.  The sent and received times typically vary by the amount
of time the sending and receiving e-mail servers take to process a message.
To permanently resolve this problem, contact your e-mail server
administrator to determine if the date and time can be corrected on the
server or if the format of the date can be changed.
