The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Outlook 97 version 8.01 is a version of Outlook that ships with
and is optimized for use with Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0. It is not a
maintenance release and does not contain new Outlook client features.
However, it does enable Outlook to take advantage of Microsoft Exchange
Server 5.0 enhancements. The original version of Outlook that ships with
Microsoft Office 97 and as a stand-alone program is version 8.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following topics are described in more detail in this article:

<UL><LI>Differences in Versions 8.0 and 8.01
<LI>Determining If You Have Version 8.01
<LI>Upgrade Decision Information
<P>
</UL><h3>Differences in Versions 8.0 and 8.01</h3>
 
<P>
The differences in version 8.01 fall into two categories: General Changes
and Exchange Server 5.0 specific changes.
<P>
General Changes:

<UL><LI>Updated MAPI and Microsoft Exchange Server service files. The Outlook
   client uses these files to communicate with the Microsoft Exchange
   Server. These files are version 5.0 for the Outlook 8.01 release.

<LI>Automatic sensing of new version availability. When you log in to
   version 8.01, if a newer version of the Outlook client is available,
   you will be prompted with an option to upgrade. This AutoUpdate
   feature enables system administrators to roll out new client versions
   more easily.

<LI>Different sort method for the "By Conversation Topic" view. This View
   now sorts by the most recently received message instead of
   alphabetically. This feature allows for more natural browsing of
   message threads.

<LI>Changes for the Outlook.prf file. This file is used during Setup to
   configure a "default" profile if one does not already exist. The 8.0
   version of this file created a profile that did not include the
   Microsoft Exchange Server service and specified that mail was to be
   delivered to a Personal Folder. The 8.01 version of this file configures
   a profile that does include the Microsoft Exchange server service and
   specifies that mail is to be delivered to the server mailbox. This
   change will only be included in the English version of Outlook 8.01.

<LI>Performance improvement for the viewing of free/busy times. Outlook 8.01
   uses a slightly different sort order to speed up the looking up and
   displaying of free/busy times. In addition, Outlook 8.01 publishes two
   months of Free/Busy time instead of the three months used in version
   8.0.

<LI>Change to allow a greater number of fields (for example, 300+) and
   actions to be stored in a form.

<LI>Improved handling of attached EFD forms. Using certain editing features
   (Copy/Paste, Drag and Drop) on an EFD form attached to an Outlook item
   generates an error message in version 8.0. Version 8.01 allows these
   editing features to be used successfully.

<LI>Different default for e-mail address separator. The option to 'allow
   comma as address separator' is off instead of on for version 8.01. This
   option can be toggled using the Tools, Options, Sending dialog box.

<LI>More Version information in Help About. In the Help-About Microsoft
   Outlook dialog box, there is now information on the version and internal
   build number.
<P>
</UL><h3>Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 Features</h3>
 
<P>
The following features are available with Outlook 8.01 only when connected
To Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0:

<UL><LI>Moderated folders. This feature enables folder owners to screen content
   before it is published in the folder.

<LI>Additional forwarding rule actions. Two new actions are available: the
   ability to forward a message without changing the content and the
   ability to forward as an attachment.

<LI>Improved names for favorites. Now when adding a public folder favorite
   using the Add To Favorites command on the File menu, you can create
   a "friendly" name for the favorite shortcut.

<LI>Favorites with subfolders. Subfolders can now appear in the Public
   Folder Favorites list.

<LI>Per-recipient send options. Options like UUencode vs. MIME can now be
   set on a per-recipient basis instead of only for the entire item.

<LI>Inbox assistant rule-firing termination. Version 8.01 has the ability to
   specify a rule to be the last rule that is applied on a particular
   message. Rules that normally would be applied after this rule are not
   executed.

<LI>Copy rule to Profile. Rules are stored with individual profiles. In
   earlier versions, if there is a rule that is not stored in  the
   current profile, the rule is unavailable (dimmed) in the Inbox Assistant
   dialog box. With Microsoft Exchange 5.0, you are able to click with the
   right mouse button on the rule and choose to move the rule to the
   current profile.

<LI>View Folder Permissions. There is a new permission choice that enables
   a folder owner to designate whether people can view a particular folder.

<LI>NNTP Publishing Properties. If you are the owner of a specific
   folder, and the folder's parent is also a newsgroup, there is now
   a Newsgroup property page for the folder. This enables you to
   control whether the folder's contents are visible via NNTP clients.

<LI>Address Book Views. This feature is controlled from the Microsoft
   Exchange Server and enables administrators to control the format and
   view of the address book.
<P>
</UL><h3>Determining If You Have Version 8.01</h3>
 
<P>
To determine if you have version 8.01, on the Help Menu, click About
Microsoft Outlook. If you have version 8.01, Version 8.01 will be
displayed in the dialog box.
<P>
Note that version 8.01 will be used in the Outlook PDF file, which is used
by Microsoft System Management Server (SMS) for network distributions of
software.
<P>
<P><h3>Upgrade Decision Information</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange 5.0 users are not required to upgrade to Outlook version
8.01. Outlook versions 8.0 and 8.01 are completely compatible with
Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0 and 5.0. You can use Outlook version
8.0 or 8.01 with Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0, and you can use
Outlook version 8.0 or 8.01 With Microsoft Exchange version 5.0. The
decision to upgrade should be based on the need for the Microsoft Exchange
optimizations listed in the earlier section.
