The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When assigning and reassigning tasks in Outlook, the current owner of the
task may not be updated in the task lists of all previous owners of the
task.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this issue, each time a new owner accepts the task, the new
owner must open the task, and then save and close it. All owners of a task
must use the following steps to ensure that all previous owners of a task
are updated with the new owner status:

<OL><P><LI>When you receive a new task request in your Inbox, open it, click
   Accept, and then Click OK.

<P><LI>Click the Task button on the Outlook bar.

<P><LI>Double-click the task that you just accepted in step 1.

<P><LI>Click Save, and then Close.
<P>
</OL>Now if this task is reassigned to someone else, all of the previous owners
of the task will be updated with the new owner, assuming all previous
owners have followed these same steps.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following scenario further describes the issue:

<OL><P><LI>User A assigns a task request to user B. After sending the request,
   if user A opens the task, the owner will be listed as user B.

<P><LI>User B accepts the task request. Now the task lists of both user A and
   user B lists will have user B listed as the owner.

<P><LI>User B reassigns the task to user C. Now the task lists of both user B
   and user C will list user C as the owner; however, user A will still
   have user B listed as the current owner.
<P>
</OL>This chain of events can keep reoccurring with any number of users with the
only updates occurring for the last person reassigning the task and the
person accepting the task. All previous users are not updated with current
owner status.
