<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
SPRYNET's Internet Mail system currently uses one server for both receipt
and sending of messages. If no server is specified in the Advanced Options
of the original Internet Mail service profile, the Internet Mail server box
will identify both the mail server from which you receive mail (incoming)
and the mail server from which mail is sent (outgoing).
<P>
The server name must be typed into both the Incoming Mail (POP3) and the
Outgoing Mail (SMTP) boxes if you are using the IMEP.
