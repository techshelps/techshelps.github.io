The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you set up a Rules Wizard rule to forward certain messages
automatically, the messages may not retain the original "From" information
as they did using the Inbox Assistant. Instead, the forwarded message
behaves as if you manually forwarded it. The original message "From,"
"Sent," "To," and "Subject" fields are included in the body of the
forwarded message. The original addressee information is included in the
"From" field.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Inbox Assistant provided with the following versions of Outlook is
optimized to take advantage of Microsoft Exchange Server capabilities:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.01, that ships with Exchange Server 5.0
   Service Pack 1 (SP-1)

<LI>Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.02, that ships with Microsoft Office 97
   Service Release 1 Enterprise Update (SR-1 Ep Ud)
<P>
</UL>The Inbox Assistants provided with other versions of Outlook do not include
these enhancements.
<P>
One such enhancement is a forwarding method called, "Leave message intact."
With this forwarding rule applied, the forwarded message retains the
original sender's information in the "From" field. The "To" field contains
the forwarded recipient's information. There is no indication in the body
that you forwarded the message.
<P>
The Rules Wizard does not support this method. The Inbox Assistants
provided by Outlook, version 8.0, and Outlook, version 8.02 from the
Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1 Patch do not support this method.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To use the "Leave message intact" forwarding method, you must use the Inbox
Assistant from Outlook 8.01, 8.02 SP-1, or 8.02 SR-1 Ep Ud. Additionally,
you must have the Exchange Extensions included in your add-ins. If you have
met these requirements but are using the Rules Wizard, remove the Rules
Wizard from your add-ins and restart Outlook. This will return Outlook to
the Inbox Assistant.
<P>
Follow these steps to see the setting, "Leave message intact" in the Inbox
Assistant of Outlook 8.01 or 8.02 SP-1:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Inbox Assistant.

<P><LI>Click Add Rule to open the Edit Rule box.

<P><LI>Click to select, Forward. In the Method box you have three choices:
<P>
<P><PRE>      - "Standard" Forwards messages as if you had done it manually.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      - "Leave message intact" Forwards messages as if they were originals.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      - "Insert message as an attachment" Forwards messages as attachments
<PRE></PRE>         in a new message.

</PRE></OL>If you do not see a Method box, you do not have the correct version of
Outlook.
