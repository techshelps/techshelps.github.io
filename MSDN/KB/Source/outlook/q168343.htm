<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you change the time zone setting in Microsoft Outlook, the times of
your appointments will be adjusted to the newly selected time zone. To
change the time zone setting in Outlook without changing the times for each
of your appointments, you must export the data in your calendar folder,
change the time zone setting, and then import your data back
into Outlook.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To change the current time zone do the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the Calendar tab and then click Time Zone.

<P><LI>In the Time zone list, select the desired time zone.

<P><LI>Click OK and click OK again.
<P>
</OL>Outlook automatically adjusts the times of your appointments when you
change the time zone setting. For example, if you have an appointment at
9:00 A.M. on your calendar and you change the time zone from Eastern Time
to Pacific Time, the appointment will be changed to 6:00 A.M. This feature
is useful if you travel with your computer.
<P>
You may want to change the time zone setting in Outlook without changing
the times of your appointments.  This is useful if Outlook was set
to the incorrect time zone when you began entering appointments in your
calendar.
<P>
To change the time zone setting in Outlook without changing the times for
your appointments, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Import and Export.

<P><LI>In the Import and Export Wizard, select "Export to a file," and click
    Next.

<P><LI>Select the Calendar folder and click Next.

<P><LI>Select "Comma Separated Values (Windows)" and click Next.

<P><LI>Type the full path and name of the file into which you would like to
    temporarily export the calendar data. (Example: c:\calendar.csv)

<P><LI>Click Next.

<P><LI>Verify there is a checkmark in front of "Export Appointments from the
    Calendar folder," and click Finish.
<P>
    NOTE: If the calendar you are exporting contains recurring
    appointments, you must enter a date range for Outlook to create
    individual occurrences for recurring appointments in that range.
    It is important to note any recurring appointments will be permanently
    converted to individual appointments.

<P><LI>Once Outlook finishes exporting the data, on the Tools menu click
    Options.

<P><LI>Click the Calendar tab and then click Time Zone.

<P><LI>In the Time zone list, select the desired time zone.

<P><LI>Click OK and click OK again.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Import and Export.

<P><LI>In the Import and Export Wizard, select "Import from Schedule+ or
    another program or file," and click Next.

<P><LI>Select "Comma Separated Values (Windows)" and click Next.

<P><LI>Type the full path and name of the file you created in step 5 and
    click Next.

<P><LI>Select the Calendar folder and click Next.

<P><LI>Click Finish for Outlook to import the calendar data back into the
    calendar folder with the original appointment times.
