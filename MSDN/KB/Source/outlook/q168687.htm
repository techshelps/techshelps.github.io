The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
<LI>Microsoft Schedule+ Version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You are using Schedule+ version 1.0 and trying to view the free/busy status
of another person who has migrated from Schedule+ 1.0 to the Microsoft
Outlook 97 Calendar. The free/busy information is not available for
viewing. An indication that free/busy status cannot be read is the
checkmark to the left of the user name in the Attendees is a lighter shade
of gray than the check box by your name.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Schedule+ 1.0 has a feature that allows you to set permissions for viewing
of free/busy status. When a Schedule+ 1.0 user queries for free/busy
status, Schedule+ first checks a permission table to see if permission to
read the free/busy information has been denied. If permission has been
denied then no free/busy status is available in the planner view.
<P>
The permission table is stored separately from the calendar file. When you
upgrade from Schedule+ 1.0 to Outlook, the free/busy permissions table is
not changed or migrated in any way. Additionally, since Outlook (and
Schedule+ 7.x) do not allow for permission settings for free/busy viewing,
there is no option in Outlook to change the permission settings that were
applied in Schedule + 1.0. If a Schedule+ user did not have permission to
view your free/busy status in Schedule+ 1.0, they will not have permission
to view it after you upgrade to Outlook.
<P>
Setting permissions to not allow reading of free/busy status is rare. The
permission exist by default, and in practice is rarely turned off.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
After you upgrade to Outlook, since there is no direct option to adjust the
permission table, you can use either of the methods below to change the
permissions that were set using Schedule+ 1.0:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
On the Options menu, click, Set Access Privileges and make the permissions
changes. This can be done without adversely affecting any calendar data
that has been migrated to Outlook.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
Start Outlook one time only with the, /cleanschedplus command line
switch. This will delete all Schedule+ data (free/busy, permissions, and
.CAL file) from the server and allow the free/busy information from the
Outlook Calendar to be used and viewed by all Schedule+ 1.0 users. To
start Outlook with the /cleanschedplus command line switch, use the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation 4.0, use the right mouse button
   to click the Microsoft Outlook icon, click Properties, and then click
   the Shortcut tab.
<P>
   In Windows NT Workstation 3.51, click the Microsoft Outlook icon, and
   then click Properties on the File menu.

<P><LI>In the Target box or the Command Line box, type the path to the
   Microsoft Outlook program file, type a space after the path,
   and then type /cleanschedplus.
<P>
   NOTE: If any path listed in the Target box (or Command Line box)
   contains spaces, such as C:\Program Files, you must enclose the path
   in quotation marks and use the correct case for each character in the
   path. The /cleanschedplus command line switch must be typed outside
   the quotation mark.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This issue only occurs when the post office being used is a Shared File
System (SFS) post office (Microsoft Mail or Workgroup Post Office). There
are also other factors  which affect your ability to view free/busy status.
For example, Outlook users can choose not to publish free busy times, so
other users cannot see free/busy status.
