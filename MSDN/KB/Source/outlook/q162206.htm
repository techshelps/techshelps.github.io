<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Personal Folders are folders that you create to store mail messages on your
local hard disk or on another server. You add a main Personal Folders as a
service to the User Profile and give it a file name. Personal Folders have
a .PST extension. For MSMail Post Offices, a Personal Folders is set up
automatically because the Inbox and Outlook folders have to reside there.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Personal Folders file contains folders, messages, forms, and files. You
work with a Personal Folders file as you would with any other file, and you
can save, copy, and move a .pst file to another location on your hard disk,
a floppy disk, or a server. You can also designate a Personal Folders file
as the delivery location for your incoming messages.

To set the delivery location, follow these steps:

<P><LI>In the Services dialog box, click the Delivery tab.

   want to send and receive messages.
