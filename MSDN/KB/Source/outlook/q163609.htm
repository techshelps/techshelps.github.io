<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides several tips that you can use to manage Microsoft
Outlook 97 windows. Within Outlook, you can control what folder opens by
default. You can also set folders to open in separate windows or have
multiple folder windows open when you start Outlook.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Starting Outlook with a Specific Folder Open</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to start Outlook with one of your default Messaging application
programming interface (MAPI) folders open (Inbox, Calendar, Contacts,
Tasks, Journal, or Notes), follow the steps in the Outlook Help topic,
"Specify the folder to open when you start Outlook."
<P>
NOTE: There is no user interface for setting a MAPI folder, other than your
default folders, as the folder that opens when Outlook starts.
<P>
If you want to start Outlook with a non-MAPI system folder open, follow the
steps in the Outlook Help topic, "Control what happens when you start
Outlook."
<P>
<P><h3>Using Multiple Windows</h3>
 
<P>
In the following situations, you may want to use more than one Outlook
window to manage your information:

<UL><LI>You constantly switch back and forth between your Inbox and your
   Calendar. Not only does it take time to reload the information each
   time you switch from one folder to another, but by default, the Calendar
   opens with today as the active date instead of the date you were at
   previously.

<LI>You manage the Calendar of other persons or resources. They have sent
   you a link in e-mail to their Calendar and when you click the link,
   their Calendar opens in a separate Outlook window.

<LI>You have several Public Folders that you constantly use and browse. You
   would like to have Outlook open each Public Folder in a separate window.
<P>
</UL>The following tips help you to use multiple Outlook windows to manage your
information.
<P>
Opening a New Window for a Personal or Shared Folder:
<P>
Use the following procedure to open a MAPI or non-MAPI folder in a second
window:

<OL><P><LI>Using your right mouse button (right-click), click the Outlook Bar
   shortcut of the item that you want to open.

<P><LI>On the shortcut menu, click "Open in New Window."
<P>
</OL>For example, if you want to have one Outlook window display the Inbox and
another window display the Calendar, with the Inbox open, right-click the
Calendar folder, and then click "Open in New Window." You can then press
ALT+TAB on the keyboard to switch between the two windows.
<P>
Starting Outlook with Folders Open in Separate Windows:
<P>
Outlook behaves differently depending on the type of folder; MAPI folders
behave differently from system folders. Examples of MAPI folders are the
e-mail message folders, Inbox, Sent Items, Outbox, Journal, Calendar,
Tasks, and Notes folders.

<UL><LI>If the folder is a mailbox, personal, or shared MAPI folder, and you
   have the folder open in another window when exiting and logging off of
   Outlook, then Outlook will automatically reopen that folder in a new
   window the next time you start Outlook.

<LI>If the folder is not a MAPI folder, Outlook will not automatically
   reopen the folder in another window the next time you start Outlook.
   Although you cannot set Outlook to start with a non-MAPI folder open
   in a second window, you can create a shortcut to force Outlook to start
   with a single, non-MAPI folder window open.
<P>
</UL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about starting Outlook with a specific non-MAPI folder
open, type "window start" in the Office Assistant, click Search, and then
click to view "Control what happens when you start Outlook."
<P>
For more information about starting Outlook with one of your default MAPI
folders open, type "start" in the Office Assistant, click Search, and then
click to view "Specify the folder to open when you start Outlook."
