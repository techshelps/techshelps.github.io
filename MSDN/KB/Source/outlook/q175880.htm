<P>
This article describes how to configure Microsoft Outlook 97 to send and
receive e-mail using MSN, The Microsoft Network, version 2.5.
<P>

<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>The MSN 2.5 Setup</h3>
 
<P>
When the MSN 2.5 Setup completes, you will see the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Ready to Go Online

   MSN setup is almost complete. There are just a few finishing touches we
   need to make to your new email and chat programs

   Please double-click the MSN icon on your desktop now to go online, and
   we'll do the rest!

</PRE>After double clicking the MSN icon on your desktop, MSN will connect and
the browser will present a page with the title "Downloading...". MSN will
automatically continue to the next page which is titled "Internet Mail
Upgrade." The following options appear on this page:

<UL><LI>I want to use Internet Mail (recommended)

<LI>Tell me more about Internet Mail
<P>
</UL>If you select the first option, it configures Outlook Express and upgrades
your mail account on MSN to SMTP/POP3 servers. At this point, you can no
longer use the Microsoft Network Online Service. You must use either
Outlook Express or Outlook 97 with the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch.
<P>
If you want to use Outlook 97, you must use the Internet Mail Enhancement
Patch. For more information on the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch please
refer to the "Downloading the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch" and
"Configuring Outlook 97 with the Internet Enhancement Patch" sections
later in this article.
<P>
If you select the second option, a page titled "More about Internet Mail"
appears with more information about using Internet Mail with the following
options:

<UL><LI>Great! I want to use Internet Mail (recommended)

<LI>Thanks, but I'll keep my current e-mail program
<P>
</UL>If you select the first option, it configures Outlook Express AND upgrades
your mail account on the MSN to SMTP/POP3 servers. At this point, you can
no longer use the Microsoft Network Online Service. You must use either
Outlook Express or Outlook 97 with the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch.
<P>
If you want to use Outlook 97, you must use the Internet Mail Enhancement
patch. For more information on the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch please
refer to the "Downloading the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch" and
"Configuring Outlook 97 with the Internet Enhancement Patch" sections
below.
<P>
If you select the second option, it does not upgrade your mail account on
the MSN servers. At this point, you can continue using the Microsoft
Network Online Service.
<P>
If you did not upgrade your mail account during the above setup process,
you can do so at a later time by connecting to:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://setup.msn.com/membersonly/config/choose2.htm">http://setup.msn.com/membersonly/config/choose2.htm</A></B>

</PRE>The above link will re-connect you to the "Internet Mail Upgrade" page,
where you can select the "I want to use Internet Mail (recommended)"
