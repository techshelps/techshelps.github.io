The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the purpose and use of the Switch Forms utility,
included in the Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit and available on the
Microsoft Web site.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Outlook and Microsoft Exchange clients each use a slightly different
form technology. When you install Outlook, the setup program configures
your system to run Outlook; switching to the Microsoft Exchange Client can
cause slower performance. Since you may need to use both clients on the
same computer, Office 97 includes a utility that allows you to indicate
which client you are using and configure your computer appropriately. This
utility allows you to switch between clients without any performance loss.
The SwitchForms utility ships with the Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit CD-
ROM and is also available on the following Microsoft Internet Web sites:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/OfficeFreeStuff/Outlook/">http://www.microsoft.com/OfficeFreeStuff/Outlook/</A></B>

</PRE>or
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://backoffice.microsoft.com/downtrial/moreinfo/exres95.asp">http://backoffice.microsoft.com/downtrial/moreinfo/exres95.asp</A></B>

</PRE>NOTE: Because Microsoft Web sites are constantly updated, the site
addresses may change without notice. If this occurs, link to the Microsoft
home page at the following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</A></B>

</PRE>With the SwitchForms utility, you can easily switch between the Microsoft
Exchange Client and Outlook. Although you can view the same e-mail folders
in both programs, each program installs its own forms for composing and
reading messages. If you need to run both the Microsoft Exchange Client and
Outlook on the same computer, use SwitchForms to register the correct
forms.
<P>
NOTE: Using the wrong form with either mail client may result in a "Cannot
create the item" error message.
<P>
The SwitchForms utility is intended for:

<UL><LI>Help desk personnel who support and run both programs.

<LI>Microsoft Exchange Server public folder application designers who
   need to test their applications under both the Microsoft Exchange Client
   and Outlook.

<LI>Systems professionals who run Microsoft Exchange Client for
   production use but need to evaluate Outlook.
<P>
</UL><h3>Installing SwitchForms</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps to install the SwitchForms utility:

<OL><P><LI>From the Microsoft Web site listed above, click the link to download
   the file Switchfm.exe and save it to your hard drive.

<P><LI>In Windows Explorer, double-click Switchfm.exe to run Setup.
<P>
</OL>The SwitchForms files decompress and install in the \Program
Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Forms\ folder on your computer. The Setup
also creates a Switch Forms menu item.
<P>
SwitchForms requires the form configuration files from the Microsoft
Exchange Client, which the Microsoft Exchange Client Setup program installs
automatically. SwitchForms also requires the Outlook 97 form configuration
files, which the Typical option of Office or Outlook Setup does not
provide. Follow these steps to install the Outlook form configuration
files:

<OL><P><LI>Run Office or Outlook Setup and click "Add/Remove."

<P><LI>In Options, click to select "Microsoft Outlook" and
   then click "Change Option."

<P><LI>Click to select "Visuals for Form Design."

<P><LI>Click OK and Continue.
<P>
</OL><h3>Running SwitchForms</h3>
 
<P>
Before you use Outlook SwitchForms, quit the Microsoft Exchange Client or
Outlook. Then use the following steps to run the SwitchForms utility:

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows Taskbar, click Start and then Programs and Switch Forms
   to run the Regforms.exe file on your hard drive.

<P><LI>In the "Install forms for" box, click to select either "Microsoft
   Exchange Client" or "Microsoft Outlook" to indicate which
   program you want to  switch to.

<P><LI>In the "Search for form configuration files" box, type the path for the
   form configuration files.
<P>
   You do not need to specify a full path. SwitchForms searches the folder
   you specify and all of its subfolders. By default, Microsoft Exchange
   Client form configuration files install in the folder
   C:\Windows\Forms\Configs. Outlook form configuration files install in
   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Forms.

<P><LI>Click OK to configure your computer for the appropriate forms.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you have Outlook or Microsoft Exchange Client files
running on your computer, you may receive errors when you run SwitchForms.
To correct this problem, restart your computer and run SwitchForms again.
When SwitchForms has successfully completed, you will receive a message; if
you do not receive the message, restart your computer and run SwitchForms
again.
