<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides Sample Groupware Applications on the Microsoft Web site
that demonstrate how to use Outlook to solve business and personal needs.
These samples contain customized forms that reside in a Personal Folders
file, which you add to your Outlook profile.
<P>
The ValuPack also contains sample forms. The Valupk8.hlp help file contains
a topic, "Microsoft Office templates, forms, and wizards," which allows you
to install sample Outlook forms. These sample forms install as a Personal
Folders file (Forms.pst) in your profile.
<P>
You can remove these custom forms from your computer by:

<UL><LI>Identifying the name and path of the sample forms Personal Folders file
<LI>Removing the sample forms service from your profile
<LI>Deleting the sample forms Personal Folders file from your computer's
   hard drive

   click Properties.
