The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you attempt to open an Adobe Acrobat (PDF) file attachment that you
received in a Microsoft Outlook 97 mail message, you may receive the
following Acrobat Reader error message:
<P>
<PRE>   There was an error opening this document.
   File does not begin with '%PDF-'

</PRE>This error occurs even if you have the Acrobat Reader installed on your
computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The attached file is not in Acrobat PDF format. The Acrobat Reader expects
the first characters of a valid PDF file to contain the following text
string:
<P>
<PRE>   %PDF-

</PRE>If the sender used an attachment encoding method that is not recognized by
Outlook, such as BinHex, the file string begins with:
<P>
<PRE>   (This file must be converted with BinHex 4.0)

</PRE>To determine if the sender used BinHex encoding, follow the steps in the
More Information section below.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Have the sender change their mail attachment encoding method from BinHex to
UUencode or Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) before sending the
e-mail message with the attachment. BinHex encoding is a common format used
by Macintosh mail systems and is also available with the Eudora Pro mail
program. Consult the documentation for your particular e-mail program on
how to set the encoding format.
<P>
Some Internet Service Providers (ISP) do not support receiving MIME encoded
attachments. If this is the case for your ISP, the attachment may appear in
the body of the E-mail message as encoded text. If you have this symptom,
you can only receive UUencoded e-mail attachments.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use these steps to determine if your file attachment is in BinHex format or
in Acrobat Reader PDF format:

<OL><P><LI>Drag the file attachment to the Windows Desktop.

<P><LI>Using your right mouse button click the Desktop file and from the
   context-sensitive menu click Rename.

<P><LI>Type Test.txt as the new file name and press ENTER. Click Yes to a
   prompt about the file becoming unusable if you change the file
   extension.

<P><LI>On the Desktop, double click Test.txt to open the file in NotePad.

<P><LI>If the file is in BinHex format, the first line starts with:
<P>
<P><PRE>      (This file must be converted with BinHex 4.0)
</PRE><P>
   If the file is in Acrobat PDF format, the first line starts with:
<P>
<P><PRE>      %PDF-
