The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to distribute custom forms to other users of
Microsoft Outlook who are not using the same mail system or who are
otherwise not connected except through e-mail.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After a form has been created you can publish the form to several
different locations. These locations include the following:

<UL><LI>A folder on your local computer, such as the Inbox

<LI>Your Personal forms library

<LI>Your Organizational forms library.
<P>
</UL>The process of distributing a form, to a person or to a group that is
outside your organization is different. You can do this by saving the form
as an Outlook Form Template (.oft), and then sending that file as an
attachment in an e-mail message. The recipients open the attachment and
publish the form to the appropriate location.
<P>
<P><h3>Saving the Form as an Outlook Form Template</h3>
 
<P>
To save the form as a template, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>With the form open, click Save As on the file menu.

   are saving the form.

<P><LI>In the Save As box, click to select Outlook Template(.oft).

<P><LI>Click Save, and then close the form.
<P>
   If you are prompted to save changes to the form, click No.

<P>
</OL><h3>Opening and Publishing the New Form</h3>

   attached form.
