The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how you can customize Microsoft Outlook 97 to
archive your items in a specific location and file on your hard drive. It
also describes how you can later add the archive file to your profile so
that you can retrieve the archived items.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default the Outlook AutoArchive features is set to run every 14 days.
Additionally, each folder contains an archive property, which determines
when items in that folder are archived. Several Outlook folders are
installed with AutoArchive turned on. These folders and their default aging
periods are Calendar (6 months), Tasks (6 months), Journal (6 months), Sent
Items (2 months), and Deleted Items (2 months). Inbox, Notes, and Contacts
do not have AutoArchive activated automatically.
<P>
When you archive folders, you are moving the items from their existing
folder into an archive type of Personal Folders or PST file. By default,
Outlook saves archived items in the following location:
<P>
<PRE>   c:\My Documents\Archive.pst

</PRE>The file Archive.pst is just like any other Personal Folders file (PST) in
that it retains the same file structure as your original folders and you
can add or remove an Archive.pst file from your Outlook profile.
<P>
You can change the file name (Archive.pst) and location (C:\My Documents\)
so that your Outlook items are archived in another location of your
choosing.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Outlook to Use A Custom Archive Location</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps to change the location and file name of your archived
items:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools Menu, click Options and click the AutoArchive tab.

<P><LI>In the "Default archive file" box, type the path and file name for
   location you want items archived. Be sure to use the .pst extension on
   the file name.

<P><LI>Note the "AutoArchive every X days at startup" check box. This
   determines how often AutoArchive occurs.

<P><LI>Click OK to close the Options box.
<P>
</OL>The next time Outlook successfully archives items, Outlook creates the
archive file that you named in step 3 above. This new file contains all of
your archived items in the same folder structure.
<P>
Since the archive file is a PST file, you can view archived items either by
importing them, using the "Export and Import Wizard", or by adding the
archive Personal Folders file as a service in your profile.
<P>
If you choose to import the items, they move back to their original
location. For more information on importing a PST file, please see the
topic "Importing Personal Folder Data" in the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article ID: <B><A HREF="../OUTLOOK/Q168644.htm">Q168644</A></B>
   Title     : OL97: How to Back Up Outlook's Data

</PRE></OL>If you choose to add the archive Personal Folders file to your profile, you
simply view the items from the archive folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Adding an Archive File to Your Profile</h3>
 
<P>
To add an archive file to your profile so you can view the archived items,
follow these steps:
<P>
NOTE: Keeping archived items in your profile defeats the purpose of using
the archiving feature. You should use these steps to view or copy archived
items and then remove the archive file from your profile.

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services and on the Services tab, click Add.

<P><LI>In the Available information services list, click to select Personal
   Folders.

<P><LI>In "Create/Open Personal Folders File", navigate to and click to select
   the custom archive PST file you created in the "Setting Outlook to Use A
   Custom Archive Location" section of this article and then click Open.

<P><LI>In the Name box, type Archive and then click OK. This will add Archive
   to your list of profile services.

<P><LI>Click OK to close the Services box.

<P><LI>On the Outlook Standard Toolbar, click Folder List to turn on the folder
   list view. In your folder list, you should see an Archive folder with
   your archived items in their appropriate subfolder.
<P>
