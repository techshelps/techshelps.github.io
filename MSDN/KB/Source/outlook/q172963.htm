<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When used in conjunction with Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft Outlook
97 allows users to share information in Messaging Application Programming
Interface (MAPI) folders such as Calendar, Contacts, and Tasks.
<P>
This article describes how you can share MAPI folders if you are not using
an Exchange Server network, by using Windows Briefcase
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To share MAPI folders using Briefcase, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the Import and Export Wizard in Outlook to export the MAPI folder
   you want to share to a new Personal Folders (.pst) file. To do this,
   follow these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. On the File menu in Outlook, click Import and Export.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. Under "Choose an action to perform," click "Export to a personal
       folder file (.pst)," and then click Next.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. Click to select the MAPI folder you want to share, and then
       click Next
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    d. In the Save Exported File As box, type a path to a shared directory
       on the local computer, or on a server that allows access to
       everyone.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    e. Click Finish.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Assign full access to the new .pst file to users who need to be able to
   update the data. Assign read access to people who only need to view the
   data.
<P>
   NOTE: Briefcase synchronizes files, not individual items within files.
   If many people update the data in their local copy, and then
   synchronize, updates from User A may overwrite updates from User B.
   Therefore, the fewer people who can update the files, the better.

<P><LI>Create a Briefcase folder on any computer that needs to share the .pst
   file. To do this, follow these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. In Windows Explorer, open the folder where you want to create the
       new Briefcase icon.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. On the File menu, point to New, and then click Briefcase.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. Rename the Briefcase something recognizable such as "Outlook Share."
</PRE>
<P><LI>Copy the .pst file from step 1 into the new Briefcase to make a
   synchronized copy.
<P>
   NOTE: Outlook will not permit access to .PST files that are currently
   Being accessed. On the File menu, click Exit and Log Off to close
   Outlook.

<P><LI>On the File menu in Outlook, point to Open Special Folders and then
   click Personal Folder.

<P><LI>In the Connect to Personal Folders dialog box, locate and open the new
   Briefcase. Click to select the .pst file, and then click OK to load this
   file into your current Outlook profile.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 3-6 on each computer that needs to access the shared
   folder.
<P>
</OL>Before starting Outlook, each user must right-click the Briefcase in
Windows Explorer, and on the shortcut menu, click Update All. When Outlook
starts, it will have the latest copy of the shared data.
<P>
Users who have access to update the shared data should also update the
Briefcase each time they quit Outlook, so that the shared copy will be
synchronized.
<P>
With Briefcase, users who have access can also replace the shared copy with
their local copy, in order to add updates from their local computer.
