6.10
MS-DOS
kbreadme
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Macro Assembler for MS-DOS, version 6.1
</UL> 
<P>
The text below presents information from the README.TXT file provided
with the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.1a patch. The
patch updates MASM version 6.1 to version 6.1a. The patch is available
from the Microsoft Download Service (206-936-MSDL).
<P>
<P><h2>PART 1: INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Make backup copies of each file the patch changes. By default, each
   file is in the MASM BIN directory (by default, C:\MASM61\BIN). The
   patch changes the following files:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CVTOMF.EXE
      DOSXNT.EXE
      MASM.EXE
      ML.EXE
      NMAKE.EXE
      PWBC.XXT
      PWBUTILS.MXT
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The PWBC.XXT file may be named PWBC.MXT. If so, rename the
   file to PWBC.XXT before running the patch program and rename it to
   PWBC.MXT when the patch program is complete. Otherwise, the patch
   program does not update this file.

<P><LI>Make the MASM 6.1 directory the current directory. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:
      CD \MASM61
</PRE>
<P><LI>Copy the patch files into your MASM 6.1 directory. The required
   files are as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      PATCH.EXE
      PATCH.RTD
      PATCH.RTP
</PRE>
<P><LI>Enter the following at the MS-DOS command prompt to run the patch
   program:
<P>
<P><PRE>      PATCH
</PRE><P>
   The patch program produces status messages to indicate its
   progress. When the program is complete, you can delete the patch
   files.

<P><LI>In addition to modifying existing files, the patch program also
   creates several new files. To use these files, see the "Using the
   New Files" section below.

<P><LI>If you use Microsoft Visual C++ and Programmer's WorkBench (PWB),
   you may need to reselect linker options in PWB. For more
   information, see "Compatibility Problems" in the "What Has Been
   Fixed" section below.
<P>
</OL><h3>If You Have Trouble</h3>
 
<P>
If you have problems installing this patch:

<UL><LI>Verify that you have all three patch files: PATCH.EXE, PATCH.RTP,
   and PATCH.RTD.

<LI>Verify that you have the correct version of the files to update.
   This patch only modifies files from MASM version 6.1.
<P>
</UL>If you continue to have problems, please contact Microsoft Product
Support for assistance.
<P>
<P><h2>PART 2: WHAT HAS BEEN FIXED?</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Compatibility Problems with Microsoft Visual C++</h3>
 

<UL><LI>You cannot install MASM 6.1 into the same directory as Microsoft
   Visual C++ because the MS-DOS extenders conflict. Because MASM 6.1a
   uses the same version of the MS-DOS extender as Visual C++, this is
   no longer a problem.
<P>
   NOTE: Microsoft Visual C++ provides newer versions of some
   utilities. To use the newer utilities, verify that Visual C++
   appears in the PATH MS-DOS environment variable before MASM.

<LI>The MASM 6.1 PWB extensions use "/NOF" as an abbreviation for the
   "Translate Intrasegment Far Calls" linker option. "/NOF" is not a
   valid option for the Visual C++ linker. Perform the following steps
   to change the "/NOF" linker option to "/NOFA":
<P>
   1. Open the desired project.
   2. From the Options menu, choose Link Options.
   3. Select Additional Debug Options or Additional Release Options.
   4. Choose OK to close the Additional Options dialog box.
   5. Choose OK to close the Link Options dialog box.
<P>
</UL><h3>Inability to Run MASM from a Read-only Network Drive</h3>
 

<UL><LI>MASM now correctly uses the TMP environment variable to create swap
   files for virtual memory. If you run MASM from a read-only network
   drive, verify that the TMP variable specifies a drive and directory
   for which you have write permission.
<P>
</UL><h3>Other Fixes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Errors that occur assembling a very large number of files using the
   command "ML *.ASM" have been corrected.

<LI>Includes CNOCRTDW.LIB, the compact memory model library for a
   Microsoft Windows dynamic-link library (DLL).

<LI>Includes a virtual memory source browser database utility
   (BSCMAKEV.EXE).

<LI>Includes a PWB version 2.1 extension for the Microsoft Profiler
   (PWBPROF.XXT).
<P>
</UL><h2>PART 3: USING THE NEW FILES</h2>
 
<P>
The patch provides the following new files that were not part of the
original MASM 6.1 release:
<P>
<PRE>   BSCMAKEV.EXE
   CNOCRTDW.LIB
   PWBPROF.XXT

</PRE></OL>The text below explains using these new files.
<P>
NOTE: The patch program attempts to install these files into the
correct directories. If the patch program cannot locate the correct
directory for a file, it places the file into the MASM root directory.
When this occurs, it may be necessary to move the file to the correct
directory to use it, as described below.
<P>
<P><h3>BSCMAKEV.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
BSCMAKEV is a version of the BSCMAKE source browser database utility
which uses virtual memory. BSCMAKEV is slower than BSCMAKE, but it can
process larger databases.
<P>
<P><h3>CNOCRTDW.LIB</h3>
 
<P>
CNOCRTDW.LIB contains the compact memory model version of the Windows
DLL startup code. Because DLLs in the Microsoft Windows operating
system rarely use the compact memory model, this file is not typically
needed.
<P>
To use CNOCRTDW.LIB, place it into the MASM libraries directory (by
default, C:\MASM61\LIB). For more information on writing DLLs, please
refer to Chapter 10 of the "Programmer's Guide."
<P>
<P><h3>PWBPROF.XXT</h3>
 
<P>
PWBPROF.XXT extends PWB to use the Microsoft Source Profiler version
1.0. The PWB extension originally supplied with Profiler version 1.0
is not compatible with the current version of PWB.
<P>
To use the Profiler with PWB, rename this file to PWBPROF.MXT and
place it into the same directory as PWB (for example, C:\MASM61\BIN).
When PWB starts, it automatically loads the extension. For more
information on loading the extension manually, please refer to the
instructions on using PWB in the "Environment and Tools" manual.
