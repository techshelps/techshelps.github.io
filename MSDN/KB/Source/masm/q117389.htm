Intel 80286, 80386, 80486, and Pentium processors:
<P>
Exception | Description
(dec/hex) |
----------|-------------------------------------------------
<PRE>  0  00h  | Divide error:
          | Occurs during a DIV or an IDIV instruction when the
          | divisor is zero or a quotient overflow occurs.

  1  01h  | Single-step/debug exception:
          | Occurs for any of a number of conditions:
          | - Instruction address breakpoint fault
          | - Data address breakpoint trap
          | - General detect fault
          | - Single-step trap
          | - Task-switch breakpoint trap

  2  02h  | Nonmaskable interrupt:
          | Occurs because of a nonmaskable hardware interrupt.

  3  03h  | Breakpoint:
          | Occurs when the processor encounters an INT 3 instruction.

  4  04h  | Overflow:
          | Occurs when the processor encounters an INTO instruction
          | and the OF (overflow) flag is set.

  5  05h  | Bounds check (BOUND instruction):
          | Occurs when the processor, while executing a BOUND
          | instruction, finds that the operand exceeds the specified
          | limit.

  6  06h  | Invalid opcode:
          | Occurs when an invalid opcode is detected.

  7  07h  | Coprocessor not available:
          | Occurs for one of two conditions:
          | - The processor encounters an ESC (escape) instruction
          |   and the EM (emulate) bit of CR0 (control register zero)
          |   is set.
          | - The processor encounters either the WAIT instruction or
          |   an ESC instruction and both the MP (monitor
          |   coprocessor) and TS (task switched) bits of CR0 are set.

  8  08h  | Double fault:
          | Occurs when the processor detects an exception while
          | trying to invoke the handler for a prior exception.

  9  09h  | Coprocessor segment overrun:
          | Occurs when a page or segment violation is detected while
          | transferring the middle portion of a coprocessor operand
          | to the NPX.

 10  0Ah  | Invalid TSS:
          | Occurs if, during a task switch, the new TSS is invalid.

 11  0Bh  | Segment not present:
          | Occurs when the processor detects that the present bit of
          | a descriptor is zero.

 12  0Ch  | Stack exception:
          | Occurs for one of two conditions:
          | - As a result of a limit violation in any operation that
          |   refers to SS (stack segment register)
          | - When attempting to load SS with a descriptor that is
          |   marked as not-present but is otherwise valid

 13  0Dh  | General protection violation:
          | Each protection violation that does not cause another
          | exception causes a general protection exception.
          | - Exceeding segment limit when using CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS
          | - Exceeding segment limit when referencing a descriptor
          |   table
          | - Transferring control to a segment that is not executable
          | - Writing to a read-only data segment or a code segment
          | - Reading from an execute-only segment
          | - Loading SS with a read-only descriptor
          | - Loading SS, DS, ES, FS, or GS with a descriptor of a system
          |   segment
          | - Loading DS, ES, FS, or GS with the descriptor of an
          |   executable segment that is also not readable
          | - Loading SS with the descriptor of an executable segment
          | - Accessing memory through DS, ES, FS, or GS when the segment
          |   register contains a NULL selector
          | - Switching to a busy task
          | - Violating privilege rules
          | - Loading CR0 with PG=1 and PE=0
          | - Interrupt or exception through trap or interrupt gate from
          |   V86 mode to a privilege level other than 0

 14  0Eh  | Page fault:
          | Occurs when paging is enabled (PG=1) and the processor
          | detects one of the following conditions while translating
          | a linear address to a physical address:
          | - The page-directory or page-table entry needed for the
          |   address translation has 0 in its present bit.
          | - The current procedure does not have sufficient privilege
          |   to access the indicated page.

 15  0Fh  | (Reserved)

 16  10h  | Coprocessor error:
          | Occurs when the processor detects a signal from the
          | coprocessor on the ERROR# input pin.

 17  11h  | (Reserved)
 through  |
 31  1Fh  |
