The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you create a relationship between two attached tables, you receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   An error has occurred in your application. If you choose Ignore,
   you should save your work in a new file. If you choose Close, your
   application will terminate.

</PRE>If you choose Ignore, you can save your work in a new file, but if you
choose Close, you receive a second error message:
<P>
<PRE>   MSACCESS caused a General Protection Fault in module MSAJT200.DLL
   at 002B:06BD.

</PRE>When you close the error message window, your application terminates.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The above error occurs when you use any two attached tables that do not
have a relationship defined in the source database.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, you need to upgrade your installation of
Microsoft Access with the Microsoft Access version 2.0 Service Pack.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem no longer occurs with the Microsoft Jet database engine
version 2.5. The Microsoft Jet database engine version 2.5 is available
with the Microsoft Access version 2.0 Service Pack. For information about
how to obtain the Service Pack, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Following these steps will cause a General Protection Fault
on your computer. Make sure you save and close any open work on your
computer before following these steps.

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and create a new database named DB1.MDB.

<P><LI>Close the new database, and then open it in shared mode by making sure
    that the Exclusive and the Read Only check boxes are not checked.

<P><LI>Import the Orders table and the Employees table from the sample
    database NWIND.MDB.

<P><LI>Attach the Orders table and the Employees table from DB1.MDB (the
    database that you have open). The attached Orders table is named
    Orders1 and the attached Employees table is named Employees1.

<P><LI>Open the Orders table.

<P><LI>With the Orders table open, press the F11 key to switch to the Database
    window, and then choose Relationships from the Edit menu.

<P><LI>In the Add Table dialog box that appears, select the Orders1 table
    and the Employees1 table in the Table/Query box, and then choose the
    Add button.

<P><LI>Create a relationship between the tables by dragging the Employee ID
    field from the Employees1 table to the Employee ID field in the
    Orders1 table.

<P><LI>Check the Inherited Relationship and the Enforce Referential Integrity
    check boxes in the Relationships dialog box, and then choose the Create
    button. Note that you receive the error message:
<P>
       Couldn't lock table 'Orders'; currently in use.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Cancel the Relationships dialog box by choosing the Cancel button.

<P><LI>Close the Orders table, and then repeat steps 7 and 8. Note that you
    receive the error messages described earlier.
