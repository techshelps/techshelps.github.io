The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you try to use an MDE file as the data source of a mail merge in
Microsoft Word, the Header Record Delimiters dialog box appears and prompts
you to supply a field delimiter and a record delimiter with the following
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Data fields must be separated from each other by a character
   called a field delimiter. Similarly, data records must be
   separated by a record delimiter.

</PRE>The Preview box of this Header Record Delimiters dialog box contains only
garbage characters. If you click OK, Microsoft Word creates a merge
document
with a single merge field whose name consists of garbage characters. If you
click Cancel, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Word was unable to open the data source.

</PRE>The behavior occurs when you try to start a mail merge from Microsoft Word
by clicking Mail Merge on the Tools menu. The problem also occurs when you
initiate the mail merge from Microsoft Access by using the "Merge It with
MS Word" Wizard.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Start Windows Explorer, locate the MDE file and rename it so that its
extension is MDB instead of MDE. If the MDE file is located in the same
folder as the MDB file, you must rename the MDE file so that its name is
different from that of the original MDB file. For example, if your file is
named Mergedata.mde, you may want to rename it Mergedata2.mdb. Giving the
new file a different name from that of the original file also reduces the
possibility of accidentally overwriting the original MDB file with the new
MDB file. Note that you can modify the design of forms, reports or modules
only by modifying the forms, reports or modules in the original database
and saving it as an MDE again, so it is important to keep a copy of the
original database.
<P>
Changing the file name extension of a database from MDE to MDB does not
affect the special characteristics of an MDE file. Users of the database
are still prevented from:

<UL><LI>Creating, viewing, or modifying forms, reports, or modules in Design
   view.

<LI>Adding, deleting, or changing references to object libraries or
   databases.

<LI>Changing code using the properties or methods of the Microsoft Access
   or Visual Basic for Applications Object models--an MDE file contains no
   source code.

<LI>Changing the Visual Basic for Applications project name in your database
   using the Options dialog box.

<LI>Importing or exporting forms, reports, or modules.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 97.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Access 97, open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Database Utilities, and then click Make MDE
   File.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open Database.

<P><LI>In the Open dialog box, click MDE Files (*.MDE) in the Files Of Type
   list.

<P><LI>Locate Northwind.mde and select it. Click Open.

<P><LI>On the Tools Menu, point to Office Links, and click Merge It With
   MS Word.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Word Mail Merge Wizard, click "Create a new document
   and then link data to it"; click OK. Note that you see the behavior
