The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article describes how to use an SQL pass-through query for a form's
record source. It assumes that you know how to build and use SQL pass-
through queries.
<P>
The following considerations should be kept in mind when you are using SQL
pass-through queries for forms' record sources:

<UL><LI>SQL pass-through query record sources are read-only.

<LI>The Query Builder does not save the connect string unless you save
   the query.

<LI>You cannot use a linked subform or subreport with a SQL pass-through
   query as its record source.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>SQL Pass-Through Queries Are Read-Only</h3>
 
<P>
Forms based on SQL pass-through queries are read-only because SQL pass-
through queries are read-only. The recordset returned by an SQL pass-
through query is a snapshot, or read-only recordset. This behavior is by
design. In order for the form to be updateable, base your form on an
attached table with a unique index.
<P>
<P><h3>The Query Builder Does Not Save the Connect String</h3>
 
<P>
The RecordSource property's Query Builder displays a window that looks
similar to a query's Design window. You use this window to build the SQL
string or query for the RecordSource property. The Query Builder will set
the RecordSource property to an SQL string if the SQL string is not saved
as a query. If you save the string as a query, the name of the query will
be used as the RecordSource property.
<P>
When you are using an SQL pass-through query created using the Query
Builder, the ODBC connect string defined in that query will not be returned
as part of the RecordSource property SQL string. This can produce the error
message "Couldn't find input table or query '[Table from ODBC Server]'"
because without the ODBC connect string, the form will look for a local
table, instead of a table on the server. If you save the SQL string as a
query, the RecordSource property will contain the name of the query instead
of the SQL string, and the form will be able to retrieve the remote data
correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>SQL Pass-Through Queries cannot use LinkChildFields/LinkMasterFields</h3>
 
<P>
The best way to use server-based data in a subform is to attach the remote
table and then base the subform on the attachment.
<P>
If you base a subform directly on an SQL pass-through query, you may
receive the following error message when you open the form:
<P>
<PRE>   In Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97:

      You can't use a pass-through query or a non-fixed column crosstab
      query as a record source for a subform or subreport.

   In Microsoft Access 1.x and 2.0:

      The crosstab query underlying a subform or subreport must have fixed
      column headings.

</PRE>This error will occur in Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97 if you have
LinkMasterFields and LinkChildFields defined for the subform or subreport.
In order to use an SQL pass-through query as a subform's record source
in Microsoft Access 1.x and 2.0, you have to dynamically set the subform's
RecordSource property in the main form's Load event. The following is an
example of an OnLoad property event procedure in the main form MainForm
that dynamically sets the RecordSource property in the subform SPTSubForm:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MainForm_OnLoad
     Me!SPTSubForm.Form.RecordSource = "[&lt;Name of SQL pass-through query&gt;]"
   End Sub

</PRE>The subform itself should be saved without a RecordSource property. Note
that the subform will not work if the LinkMasterFields and LinkChildFields
properties are set. If you need to filter the records in the subform based
on a value in the main form, either base your query on attached tables, or
modify the QueryDef so that the query includes the value in the main form.
