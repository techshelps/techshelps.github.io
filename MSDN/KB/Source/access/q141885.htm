The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.1, 2.0, 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you base a report on a query that has a sort order defined, the sort
order is retained in the report. However, if you add a calculated field to
the report footer, the sort order from the query is no longer used.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Reports use their own internal queries. They are not designed to use a
query's sort order. The fact that a query's sort order is maintained in a
report without the calculated field in the report footer is by chance.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Define your report sort order in the report's Sorting And Grouping dialog
box.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in versions 1.1
    and 2.0).

<P><LI>Create a new query based on the Orders table.

<P><LI>Add the OrderID, ShipCity, and Freight fields.
<P>
    NOTE: In versions 1.1 and 2.0, there is a space in the Order ID and in
    the Ship City fields.

<P><LI>For the ShipCity field, set Sort to Ascending.

<P><LI>Close and save the query as Query1.

<P><LI>Create a new report based on Query1.

<P><LI>Add each of the fields from Query1 to the report's detail section.

<P><LI>Preview the report. Notice that the report is sorted by ShipCity.

<P><LI>Add a text box to the report's footer section. Set the ControlSource
    property to "=Sum([Freight])" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Preview the report. Notice that the report is no longer sorted by
    ShipCity.
<P>
