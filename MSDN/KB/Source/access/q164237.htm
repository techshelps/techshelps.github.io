The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
After you try to synchronize with a deleted replica database, the deleted
replica's name still appears in the list of databases when you point to
Replication on the Tools menu, and then click Synchronize Now.
<P>
NOTE: This does not apply to replication features implemented using the
Replication Manager from the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version
7.0.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can create a custom procedure that tries to synchronize with the
deleted replica using the Synchronize method. If the database is not found,
its name is removed from the synchronization list. Run the following
procedure in each database in the replica set where you want to remove a
deleted replica name from the synchronization list.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub RemoveDeletedReplica()
      Dim strDelReplica as String
      On Error Resume Next
      strDelReplica = InputBox _
         ("Enter the full path and name of deleted replica")
      CurrentDb.Synchronize strDelReplica
   End Sub

</PRE>Type the path and file name of the deleted replica in the input box. After
the procedure runs, you can point to Replication on the Tools menu, and
then click Synchronize Now. Note that the deleted replica no longer appears
in the Synchronize With box.
<P>
NOTE: This method does not work if you create a replica, delete it, create
another replica with the same path and file name, and then delete that
replica again.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior no longer occurs in Microsoft Access 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and create a new blank database.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Replication, and then click Create Replica.
   Follow the instructions on your screen to convert the current database
   to Design Master and create a new replica.

<P><LI>Repeat step 2 to create another replica.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Replication, and then click Synchronize Now.
   Synchronize with one of the two replicas in the Synchronize With box.
   Close and reopen the database when prompted; then repeat this step and
   select the other replica in the Synchronize With box.

<P><LI>Start Windows Explorer or File Manager and delete one of the replicas.

<P><LI>In Microsoft Access, point to Replication on the Tools menu, and then
   click Synchronize Now. Select the deleted replica in the Synchronized
   With box, and then click OK. Note that you receive the following error
   message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Access can't open the database '&lt;Database Name&gt;'.
      Couldn't find file '&lt;Database Name&gt;'.
</PRE><P>
   Click OK.

<P><LI>Cancel the Synchronize Database dialog box, and then close the database.

<P><LI>Reopen the database.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Replication and then click Synchronize Now.
   Note that the deleted database name still appears in the Synchronize
   With box. The name remains even after you compact or repair the
   database.
