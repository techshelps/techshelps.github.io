<PRE>1. Q. What types of files can Microsoft Access for Windows 95 import
      or link?

   A. You can import and link the following file types in Microsoft
      Access for Windows 95:

       - Microsoft FoxPro(R) versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.6, and 3.0. (Note
         that you can only import 3.0 files; you cannot link them.)

       - dBASE(R) III, III+, IV, and 5.0.

       - Paradox(R) versions 3.x, 4.x, and 5.0.

       - SQL tables and data from programs and databases that support
         the ODBC protocol.

       - Microsoft Excel spreadsheets versions 2.x, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and
         7.0.

       - Lotus(R) 1-2-3(R) spreadsheets, .WKS, .WK1, and .WK3 formats.
         (Note that you can only import these files; you cannot link
         them.)

       - Delimited text files.

       - Fixed-width text files.

      For more information about importing and linking data, search
      on the phrase "What files can I import" then view "How Do I:
      Import or link data from other programs and file formats" using
      the Answer Wizard from the Microsoft Access Help menu.

2. Q. I do not see my file type in the list in the Import dialog box.
      Does that mean I cannot import it?

   A. No, usually you can import your file by first saving it as one
      of the file types supported by Microsoft Access. For example,
      most programs have a Save As or Export option for delimited
      text files or dBASE III+ files. You can save your file as one
      of these file types in the other program and then import it
      into Microsoft Access.

3. Q. Why can't I see my text file in the list when I try to import
      it?

   A. By default, Microsoft Access for Windows 95 filters the common
      text file extensions, such as .txt and .csv. To see files with
      other extensions, type *.* in the File Name box, and then press
      ENTER.

4. Q. What kinds of graphics files does Microsoft Access for Windows
      95 support?

   A. It depends on whether you are storing the graphics file as an
      OLE object or in the new image control. When you use a bound or
      unbound object frame, you can link or embed any file type that
      has an OLE Server program registered on your computer. For
      example, if you have a Windows-based program that supports .bmp
      files, such as Paint in Windows 95, and that program is an OLE
      Server program, you can embed or link that file in a bound or
      unbound object frame on a form or report.

      If you are using the new image control, you can use bitmaps
      (.bmp or .dib extensions) or metafiles (.wmf or .emf
      extensions).

      For more information about object frames and the image control,
      search on the phrase "When should I use an object frame vs. an
      image control" then view "Tell Me About: Which type of object
      frame should I use and should I embed or link my object?" using
      the Answer Wizard from the Microsoft Access Help menu.

5. Q. What ODBC drivers are included with Microsoft Access for
      Windows 95?

   A. Microsoft Access for Windows 95 contains drivers for:

       - Microsoft SQL Server.

       - Desktop Drivers (Microsoft Access for Windows 95, Microsoft
         FoxPro, dBASE, Microsoft Excel, Paradox, and Text Files).

      The Desktop Drivers are not used by Microsoft Access. They are
      installed by Microsoft Access so that other programs, such as
      Microsoft Excel, can gain access to Microsoft Access databases
      and other data files through ODBC. Microsoft Access uses built-
      in drivers called ISAMs to gain access to these file types.

6. Q. Can I add a Microsoft Access database to the Microsoft Office
      Binder?

   A. No, only Microsoft Word documents, Microsoft Excel worksheets
      and charts, and Microsoft PowerPoint presentations can be
      added. Although you cannot add a Microsoft Access database to a
      Binder, you can embed a Binder in an OLE field in a Microsoft
      Access table.
