The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
<LI>Microsoft Office Developer Edition 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you purchase the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition (ODE), your
license agreement permits you to redistribute run-time versions of
applications that you create to users who do not have Microsoft Access 97.
When recipients of your application run your Setup program, a run-time
license for Microsoft Access 97 is set up on their computers.
<P>
This article summarizes the differences in the user interface between the
run-time version of Microsoft Access 97 and the full retail version. It
compares the two versions in the following areas:

<UL><LI>Database Windows
<LI>Object Views
<LI>Menus
<LI>Toolbars
<LI>Disabled Keys
<LI>Error Handling
<LI>Help
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Setup Wizard to create a run-time redistribution of your
custom application, the application is not compiled into a single
executable file. Instead, all of the files that Microsoft Access needs to
run your database are included with your setup, and the Setup program
creates a run-time version of your application by setting certain Windows
Registry keys.
<P>
The retail and run-time versions of Microsoft Access are identical in most
respects; in fact they both use the same executable file, Msaccess.exe.
However, there are some differences you must consider when you develop
your run-time application.
<P>
<P><h3>Database Windows</h3>
 
<P>
The Database, Macro, and Module windows are not visible in a run-time
application. Filter By Form, Filter By Selection and Advanced Filter
windows are also hidden. The windows exist, but the run-time environment
hides them. This means your application must be form based; users interact
with the forms you create and not with the underlying tables and queries,
which they cannot see.
<P>
Most run-time applications contain a main switchboard form, or menu, that
you set as the Startup form in your database. The switchboard form is the
central point in your application from which users open other forms, run
reports, and make changes to data. Because the Database window is
invisible in run-time, when users start your application they only see a
blank screen with a menu at the top if you do not include a Startup form.
<P>
<P><h3>Views</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Access run-time environment hides the Design views of
Tables, Queries, Forms, and Reports. If your application contains any
buttons or toolbars that switch an object to Design view, they will not
work in a run-time environment.
<P>
This feature adds a measure of protection to your application design, and
prevents users from viewing or modifying your objects.
<P>
<P><h3>Menus</h3>
 
<P>
The run-time environment removes several menus and commands from the menu
bar in Microsoft Access. For example, the View, Tools, and Format menus are
completely removed, and certain items are removed from the Edit, Insert,
and Records menus. This prevents users from making changes to your
application design.
<P>
In most cases, you create custom menus for each of your forms that control
what menus and commands are available to users of your application.
<P>
Even though certain menus and commands are removed from the menu bar, you
can still use the RunCommand method in your application to run commands
that are on the hidden menus.
<P>
<P><h3>Toolbars</h3>
 
<P>
All of the built-in toolbars in Microsoft Access are disabled in a
run-time environment. You must create your own custom toolbars for your
application if you want to include them.
<P>
The run-time environment does not show and hide your custom toolbars as
the context changes, so you must manipulate the toolbars in your
application using the ShowToolbar method in the OnActivate and
OnDeactivate properties of your forms and reports.
<P>
<P><h3>Unavailable Keys</h3>
 
<P>
Certain keys and key combinations are unavailable in the run-time
environment to prevent users from disrupting your application. The
following table summarizes keys that are unavailable:
<P>
<PRE>   Keys           Description
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

   CTRL+BREAK     Stops execution of code or macro

   SHIFT          Prevents execution of an AutoExec macro and bypasses
                  database Startup properties when opening a database

   ALT+F1 (F11)   Displays the Database window

   ALT+F2 (F12)   Displays the Save As dialog box

   SHIFT+F12      Saves a database object
   (ALT+SHIFT+F2)

   CTRL+G         Displays the Debug window

   CTRL+N         Opens a new database

   CTRL+ENTER     Opens an object in Design view
   (ALT+D)

   CTRL+F11       Toggles custom and built-in menu bars

</PRE><h3>Error Handling</h3>
 
<P>
Error handling is critical in a run-time application. In a retail version
of Microsoft Access, an unhandled error prompts you with an error message
and in many cases enables you to view or reset the code that caused the
error. In run-time Microsoft Access, an unhandled error shuts down your
application.
<P>
Error handling can only be accomplished with Visual Basic for Applications
code; macros do not provide error handling. Therefore, limit the use
of macros in your run-time applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Help</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to provide Help for your run-time application, you must create
your own Help file, and then set the AppHelpFile key in the Windows
Registry. Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition includes a Help Workshop
to assist you in creating custom Help files, and the Setup Wizard to assist
you in setting the AppHelpFile registry key when you create your Setup
files.
<P>
Note that the ODE end-user license agreement does not permit you to
distribute the Office Assistant as part of your Help system. If code in
your application invokes any methods or properties of the Office
Assistant, it will generate an error in a run-time environment.
