<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article describes how to create a button on a filtered form that opens
a report and applies the same filter to the report that is on the form.
<P>
NOTE: This article explains a technique demonstrated in the sample
files, RptSampl.exe (for Microsoft Access for Windows 95 version 7.0)
and RptSmp97.exe (for Microsoft Access 97). For information about how
to obtain these sample files, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q145777.htm">Q145777</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC95: Microsoft Access Sample Reports Available on MSL

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q175072.htm">Q175072</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC97: Microsoft Access 97 Sample Reports Available on MSL

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This technique involves creating a new form and report in the sample
database Northwind.mdb. The form uses event procedures to apply a filter
and to open the new report. The report uses the Filter property to apply
the same filter used in the form.

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Use the AutoReport: Tabular Wizard to create a new report based on
    the Customers table. Close and save the report as rptCustomers.

<P><LI>Use the AutoForm: Tabular Wizard to create a new form based on the
    Customers table. Close and save the form as frmFilterForm.

<P><LI>Open frmFilterForm in Design view. Increase the size of the form
    footer section to accommodate three command buttons.

<P><LI>Create a command button in the form footer and set its properties as
    follows:
<P>
<PRE>       Name:     cmdOpenReport
       Caption:  Open Report
       OnClick:  [Event Procedure]

    Set the OnClick [Event Procedure] as follows:

       Private Sub cmdOpenReport_Click()
         If Me.Filter = "" Then
           MsgBox "Apply a filter to the form first"
         Else
           DoCmd.OpenReport "rptCustomers", A_PREVIEW, , Me.Filter
         End If
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Create a second button in the form footer and set its properties as
    follows:
<P>
<PRE>       Name:     cmdClearFilter
       Caption:  Clear Filter
       OnClick:  [Event Procedure]

    Set the OnClick [Event Procedure] as follows:

       Private Sub cmdClearFilter_Click()
         Me.Filter = ""
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Create a third button in the form footer and set its properties as
    follows:
<P>
<PRE>       Name:     cmdClose
       Caption:  Close
       OnClick:  [Event Procedure]

    Set the OnClick [Event Procedure] as follows:

       Private Sub cmdClose_Click()
         DoCmd.Close acForm, Me.Form.Name
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Set the following properties for the frmFilterForm form:
<P>
       OnOpen:  [Event Procedure]
       OnClose: [Event Procedure]
<P>
    Set the form's OnOpen [Event Procedure] as follows:
<P>
       Private Sub Form_Open(Cancel as Integer)
<PRE>         Me.Filter = ""
       End Sub

    Set the form's OnClose [Event Procedure] as follows:

       Private Sub Form_Close()
         DoCmd.Close acReport, "rptCustomers"
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Switch the form to Form view.

<P><LI>On the toolbar, click the Filter By Form button to set a filter, and
    then click the Apply Filter button to apply the filter.

<P><LI>Click the Open Report button on the form. A report should appear with
    the same filter that was applied to the form.
