<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are two things to remember when dealing with security:

<OL><P><LI>Plan your security scheme from the beginning. Planning a good security
   scheme from the beginning will ensure you a minimum of work later on.

<P><LI>Assign permissions to Groups, not to Users.
<P>
   This is very important. By creating appropriate, well thought out
   groups, a user has the "best" permissions of the groups that he or she
   is a member of. For example, if a user is member of Group A, which does
   not have permissions to an object but also is a member of Group B,
   which does have the permissions to an object, the user will have Group
   B's permission to the object.
<P>
   You will find that maintenance work will decrease significantly if
   you plan your groups carefully. A typical database setup should have a
   maximum of 4 to 5 groups. This is not a maximum number of groups
   limitation for Microsoft Access, merely a guideline for easier
   security management.
<P>
</OL>There is no multiple-selection functionality in the security dialog boxes.
You cannot give a group or user permissions to more than one object at a
time; each object must be selected individually and then permissions may
be assigned.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>User Name Case Sensitivity</h3>
 
<P>
User and group names are not case sensitive when you enter them to start a
Microsoft Access session. However, if you are recreating a user account or
group you have to match the name exactly. This is due to the way the
account information is stored by the system.
<P>
NOTE: Passwords are case sensitive.
