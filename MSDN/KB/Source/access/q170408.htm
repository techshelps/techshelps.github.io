The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
On the right side of the Microsoft Access status bar, there are seven
panels that indicate filter or keyboard status. These panels are empty
unless a filter has been applied or a particular keyboard mode is in
effect. This article describes each of the seven status bar indicators.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>FLTR</h3>
 
<P>
This indicator tells you that a filter has been applied. It can appear only
when a table or query is open in Datasheet view, or when a form is open in
Form view. The FLTR indicator is visible when you click the Apply Filter
button, the Filter By Form button, or the Filter By Selection button, or
when you click Apply Filter/Sort on the Records menu. To remove the FLTR
indicator, click the Apply Filter tool again, or click Remove Filter/Sort
on the Records menu.
<P>
<P><h3>MOV</h3>
 
<P>
This indicator tells you that you are in Move mode. You can use the
keyboard to move an entire column to a different location in the datasheet.
<P>
Follow these steps to use Move mode:

<OL><P><LI>Open a table in Datasheet view.

<P><LI>Select the column you want to move by clicking on its field name.

<P><LI>Press CTRL+F8 to activate Move mode.

<P><LI>Press the RIGHT ARROW or LEFT ARROW key to move the column.
<P>
</OL>To turn off Move mode, press ESC.
<P>
<P><h3>EXT</h3>
 
<P>
This indicator tells you that you are in Extend mode. Extend mode enables
you to use the keyboard to easily extend the selected data.
<P>
Follow these steps to use Extend mode:

<OL><P><LI>Open a table in Datasheet view.

<P><LI>Click in a field in one of the records to position the pointer between
    two characters.

<P><LI>Press F8 to activate Extend mode.

<P><LI>Press F8 to select the entire word. If the field consists of more
    than one word, pressing F8 again selects all of the words in the field.

<P><LI>Press F8 again to select the entire field.

<P><LI>Press the UP ARROW key several times to extend the selection up; then
    press the DOWN ARROW key several times to extend the selection down.

<P><LI>Press F8 again to select the entire record.

<P><LI>Press the UP ARROW key several times to extend the selection up; then
    press the DOWN ARROW key several times to extend the selection down.

<P><LI>Press F8 again to select all of the records.

<P><LI>Press ESC to turn off Extend mode.
<P>
</OL><h3>CAPS</h3>
 
<P>
This indicator tells you that any alphabetic characters you type will be
uppercase. It is activated and deactivated by pressing the CAPS LOCK key.
<P>
<P><h3>NUM</h3>
 
<P>
This indicator tells you whether you have enabled the numeric keypad to
enter data. It is activated and deactivated by pressing the NUM LOCK key.
When the NUM indicator is not visible, the keys on the numeric keypad
function as navigation keys.
<P>
<P><h3>SCRL</h3>
 
<P>
This indicator tells you that in some applications the location of the
pointer remains fixed when you use the ARROW keys to scroll. However, in
Microsoft Access, the location of the pointer moves while you scroll,
regardless of whether the SCRL indicator is visible or not. The SCRL
indicator is activated and deactivated by pressing SCROLL LOCK key.
<P>
<P><h3>OVR</h3>
 
<P>
This indicator tells you that any character you type overwrites the
character to the right of the pointer. It is activated and deactivated by
pressing the INSERT key. When the OVR indicator is not visible, any
character you type is inserted at the position of the pointer.
