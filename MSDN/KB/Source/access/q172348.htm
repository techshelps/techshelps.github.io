<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
Microsoft Access 97 Service Release 1 and Microsoft Office 97 Service
Release 1 enable you to save a static picture of a Microsoft Access 97
report in an external file format (*.snp). You can then make the report
available to someone who does not have Microsoft Access 97. For example,
you can send the report in e-mail or copy it to a person's hard drive. The
person needs only the Microsoft Snapshot Viewer to be able to view the
report.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you have installed Microsoft Access Service Release 1 or Microsoft
Office 97 Service Release 1, you automatically have the ability to save
Microsoft Access reports as snapshot files. If you already have Microsoft
Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition, you can download
Service Release 1 from Microsoft's World Wide Web site at
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/office/office97/servicerelease">http://www.microsoft.com/office/office97/servicerelease</A></B>

</PRE>NOTE: Because the Microsoft Web site is constantly updated, the site
address may change without notice. If this occurs, link to the Microsoft
home page at the following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</A></B>

</PRE>Microsoft Snapshot Viewer is a separate download that consists of a stand-
alone executable program (Snapview.exe), a Snapshot View control
(Snapview.ocx), and related files.
<P>
If you have Microsoft Access 97 Service Release 1 or Microsoft Office 97
Service Release 1 on CD-ROM, Snapshot Viewer is located in the
\ValuPack\Access subfolder on the CD-ROM. Snpvw80.exe is a self-extracting
file that installs the Snapshot Viewer. Double-click the
\ValuPack\Valupk8.hlp file on your CD-ROM for information about installing
ValuPack features, including Snapshot Viewer.
<P>
You can also download Snapshot Viewer from Microsoft's World Wide Web site
at the following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/accessdev/articles/snapshot.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/accessdev/articles/snapshot.htm</A></B>

</PRE>Microsoft Snapshot Viewer enables you to view a report snapshot without
having Microsoft Access 97 or the run-time version of Microsoft Access 97
on your computer. A report snapshot is a report that has been exported to
the snapshot file format (*.snp), a new file format available in Microsoft
Access 97 Service Release 1 and Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1. A
snapshot file contains a copy of each page of the report and preserves the
report's two-dimensional layout, graphics, and other embedded objects.
<P>
You can distribute Snpvw80.exe to anyone who has Microsoft Windows 95 or
Microsoft Windows NT. The Snapshot View control (Snapview.ocx) requires
Service Pack 5 or later if you are using Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51.
<P>
NOTE: If you install and then later remove the Snapshot Viewer, you must
restart your computer after you remove the feature. Also, after you remove
the Snapshot Viewer, the Setup program leaves an empty folder on your hard
drive where the Snapshot Viewer was installed. Use File Manager or Windows
Explorer to remove the empty folder if you do want the retain the folder.
<P>
For more information about downloading the Snapshot Viewer, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
