The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you open an MDE file that was created from a secured database that
contains modules, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Record(s) can't be read; no read permissions on 'MsysModules2'

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because only the owner of the MDE file or a member of
the Admins group when the MDE file was created can successfully open an MDE
file created from a secured database that contains modules.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The following workaround allows your users to open the database. This
workaround assumes that the database is secured, the MDE file has already
been created, and you are currently using the workgroup file that was used
when the MDE file was created.

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and log on as an administrator.

<P><LI>Open the MDE file, holding down the SHIFT key to prevent any AutoExec
   macros from running.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the View tab. Make sure
   the System Objects check box is selected.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Security, and then click User And Group
   Permissions.

<P><LI>In the User And Group Permissions dialog box, click Groups, and then
   select Table in the Object Type combo box.

<P><LI>In the User/Group name list box, select Users.

<P><LI>In the Object Name list box, select MsysModules2.

<P><LI>Select the following permissions for the table:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Read Data
    - Read Design
    - Update Data
    - Insert Data
    - Delete Data
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK to close the User And Group Permissions box. Your users should
   now be able to open the MDE file.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 97. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Access if it is running, and then make a backup copy
    of your System.mdw file.

<P><LI>Using the Workgroup Administrator program, create and join a new
    workgroup. Make note of the Name, Organization, and Workgroup ID
    values used to create the new workgroup. These values are combined to
    create the group Security ID (SID) for the Admins group.
<P>
    NOTE: For information about creating a workgroup information file,
    search the Help Index for "workgroup information files, creating."

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and activate the logon process by assigning a
    password for the Admin user.

<P><LI>Create a new user and add the user to the Admins group.

<P><LI>Create another user, but do not add this user to the Admins group.

<P><LI>Quit and restart Microsoft Access, logging on as the user you created
    in Step 4.

<P><LI>Create a blank new database.

<P><LI>Create a new module with any sample code.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Security, and then click User-Level Security
    Wizard.

<P><LI>In the User-Level Security Wizard, click OK to accept the default
    settings. Click Yes to continue if you receive a warning about
    removing Admin from the Admins group.

<P><LI>In the Destination Database dialog box, click Save to accept the
    default file name for the secured database.

<P><LI>Click OK to the User-Level Security Wizard message that lets you know
    the database has been secured.

<P><LI>Open the secured version of the database.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Database Utilities, and then click Make MDE
    file. In the Save MDE As dialog box, click Save.

<P><LI>Quit and restart Microsoft Access. This time log on as the user you
    created in Step 5.

<P><LI>Open the MDE file created in Step 14. Note that you receive the error
    message mentioned in the "Symptoms" section.
