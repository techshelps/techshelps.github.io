</PRE>The disk included with this document contains two files. The
SECURE20.TXT file is a white paper that contains in-depth information
about the Microsoft Access security model to help you understand and
use Microsoft Access security effectively. The SECURE20.MDA file
contains the Microsoft Access Security Wizard, which is a tool for
easily securing your databases. The white paper includes complete
instructions for using the Security Wizard.
<P>
<P><h3>To install the Security Wizard</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert the WX1051 disk in the appropriate disk drive.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open any database.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Add-ins, and then choose Add-in Manager
   from the submenu.

<P><LI>In the Add-in Manager dialog box, choose the Add New button.

<P><LI>In the Drives box, select the drive containing the Application Note
   disk. In the File Name box, select SECURE20.MDA, then choose the OK
   button.

<P><LI>When the Security Wizard appears in the Available Libraries box,
   choose the Close button.

<P><LI>Quit and then restart Microsoft Access.
<P>
</OL>The Security Wizard runs only in Microsoft Access version 2.0. It
works with Microsoft Access version 1.x databases provided that they
are first converted to Microsoft Access version 2.0 database format.
If you try to use the Security Wizard in Microsoft Access version 1.x,
you will receive an "Out-of-date database format" error message,
followed by the message "Some library modules could not be loaded"
when you start Microsoft Access. Databases created by the Security
Wizard are in version 2.0 format.
<P>
The Security Wizard may take some time to run. For example, securing
the sample database NWIND.MDB on a 486/50 computer takes approximately
13 minutes. The Security Wizard's About dialog box gives further
information about what the Security Wizard does, as does the text file
included on the WX1051 disk.
<P>
<P><h3>The Security White Paper</h3>
 
<P>
The security white paper is a text document written by the Microsoft
Access product group. It contains in-depth information on the security
model used by Microsoft Access, details on how and why Microsoft
Access security acts the way it does, and answers to some common
security questions. The file is in text (.TXT) format and is readable
by any word processor.
