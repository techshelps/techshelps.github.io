The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article lists the references that you must set when you are working
with databases that you create in Microsoft Access or when you access
information from Microsoft Access databases from other applications.
<P>
The following topics are covered in this article:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97 Object Library References Set by Default
<LI>Microsoft Office 8.0 Object Library Reference Included in the Package
<LI>Setting a Reference to Other Applications
<LI>Setting a Reference to DAO for Different Versions of Microsoft Access
<LI>Setting a Reference to DAO for Other Applications That Use Microsoft
   Access
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access includes several components, each of which supplies its
own set of objects. The component's object library contains information
about the component's objects and their properties and methods. The objects
are available to Microsoft Access only if a reference exists for the
objects in the Available References list box in the References box on the
Tools menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Access 97 Object Library References Set by Default</h3>
 
<P>
The following object libraries are set by default when you install
Microsoft Access 97:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Access 8.0 Object Library  (MSACC8.OLB)
<P>
   The following objects and collections are found in the Microsoft
   Access 8.0 Object Library:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Application object
    - Form object
    - Forms collection
    - Report object
    - Reports collection
    - Control object
    - Controls collection
    - Module object
    - Modules collection
    - Reference object
    - References collection
    - DoCmd object
    - Screen object
</PRE>
<LI>The Visual Basic for Applications Object Library (VBA332.dll)
<P>
   The following objects are found in the Visual Basic for Applications
   Object Library:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Debug object
    - Err object
    - Collection object
</PRE>
<LI>The Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object Library (DAO350.dll)
<P>
   The following objects and collections are found in the DAO object
   library:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - DBEngine object
    - Workspace object and Workspaces collections
    - Error object and Errors collection
    - Database object and Databases collection
    - TableDef object and TableDefs collection
    - Field object and Fields collection
    - Index object and Indexes collection
    - QueryDef object and QueryDefs collection
    - Parameter object and Parameters collection
    - Relation object and Relations collection
    - Recordset object and Recordsets collection
    - Group object and Groups collections
    - User object and Users collection
    - Container object and Containers collection
    - Document object and Documents collection
    - Properties collection
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: In order to ease the conversion of applications that use older
   objects, methods, and properties, the DAO350.dll file contains two type
   libraries. They are:
<P>
<PRE>     DAO 2.5 type library   (DAO2532.tlb)
     DAO 3.5 type library   (DAO2535.tlb)

   These type libraries define the properties and methods that DAO can
   use. The DAO 2.5 type library is backward compatible with earlier
   versions of the Microsoft Jet database engine and supports all previous
   objects, methods, and properties. Use this type library if you want
   existing DAO code to work with Microsoft Jet database engine 3.0 or 3.5
   without conversion.

   The DAO 3.5 type library removes support for obsolete objects,
   methods, and properties. Because they are not supported, use of these
   constructs while the DAO 3.5 type library is in use causes compile
   errors in your code.

</PRE></UL><h3>Microsoft Office 8.0 Object Library Reference Included in the Package</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access 97 also includes the Microsoft Office 8.0 Object Library.
This is included for users who want to work with objects provided by
Microsoft Office.

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Office 8.0 Object Library (MS097.DLL)
<P>
   The following objects are found in the Office 8.0 Object Library:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - CommandBar object
    - FileSearch object
    - Assistant object
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>Setting a Reference to other applications</h3>
 
<P>
You can also set references to object libraries supplied by other
applications or components when you want to use objects in those libraries
for Automation operations in Microsoft Access. The following list gives
some of the applications and the object libraries that you can reference.
<P>
<PRE>  Application                     Reference
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Microsoft Excel 97 objects      MS Excel 8.0 Object Library (EXCEL8.olb)
  Microsoft Word 97 objects       MS Word 8.0 Object Library (MSWORD8.olb)
  Microsoft Office Binder control MS Binder 8.0 Object Library (MSBDR8.olb)
  Microsoft Graph 5.0             MS Graph 5.0 Object Library (GREN50.olb)
  Microsoft Graph 8.0             MS Graph 8.0 Object Library (GRAPH8.olb)

</PRE><h3>Setting a Reference to DAO for different versions of Microsoft Access</h3>
 
<P>
If you have more than one version of Microsoft Access on your computer,
you may need to reference different versions of the Microsoft DAO Object
Library. The following list gives the version of the application and the
version of DAO that you should use.
<P>
<PRE> Version of Microsoft Access        Version(s) of DAO
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Microsoft Access 1.0               Microsoft DAO 2.5/3.0 Compatibility

 Microsoft Access 1.1               Microsoft DAO 2.5/3.0 Compatibility

 Microsoft Access 2.0               Microsoft DAO 2.5/.3.0 Compatibility

 Microsoft Access 7.0               Microsoft DAO 3.0 Object Library

 Microsoft Access 97                Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object Library

</PRE><h3>Setting a Reference to DAO for Other Applications That Use Microsoft Access</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using other applications that communicate with different
versions of Microsoft Access, ensure that the version of DAO in the
application you are using can communicate with the version of DAO in your
version of Microsoft Access. The following list gives the version of
DAO in other applications.
<P>
<PRE> Application                        DAO
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
