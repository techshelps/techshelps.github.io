The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
In Microsoft Access 97, 7.0 and 2.0, you can only overlap controls of the
same window type. This is different from the behavior that is present in
Microsoft Access 1.x. In Microsoft Access 1.x you can overlay any control
over any other control on a form. For example, you can overlap a button
control over a list box control.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Only list boxes and subforms are windowed. All other controls are
considered non-windowed, including the labels of list boxes and subforms.
Therefore, list boxes and subforms will always remain on top if placed over
a non-windowed control even if the other control is selected.
<P>
If a list box and a subform overlap, whichever is on top in the form's
Design view will remain on top in Form view. Among controls of the same
window type, the Send To Back and Bring To Front commands will work
correctly. However, both of these commands will be ignored if you are
trying to place a windowed control on top of a non-windowed control.
<P>
The following example demonstrates this behavior:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new form not based on any table or query.

<P><LI>Add a list box to the form. If the List Box Wizard starts, click
   Cancel.

<P><LI>Add a text box to the form. Draw the text box so that it overlaps
   the list box. Note that the list box remains on top.

<P><LI>With the text box selected, click Bring To Front on the Format menu.
   Note that the command is ignored. You cannot put a non-windowed control
   on top of a windowed control.
<P>
</OL>Note that Microsoft Access version 1.x forms may not function as you expect
in Microsoft Access versions 2.0 and later because of this behavior. Also,
in Microsoft Access 2.0 and later, list boxes and subforms cannot pop up
over each other.
<P>
In addition, in version 2.0 the Move Enclosed Control setting under View,
Options, Form &amp; Report Design indicates whether all the controls contained
within the selected control are moved along with it when a control is
selected on a form or report. If you set the Move Enclosed Control option
to Yes in the Options dialog box, place a label on top of and completely
contained within a list box, the label will disappear (because it cannot be
on top of the list box.) If you select the list box and move it, the label
will move with the list box. To correct this, set the Move Enclosed Control
option to No, move the list box, and then set the option back to Yes.
<P>
Note that in Microsoft Access 2.0, in a multiuser environment, the Move
Enclosed Control option is saved per user. Therefore, overlapping behavior
could vary from one user to the next, depending on each user's Move
Enclosed Control option setting.
<P>
This behavior has been changed in Microsoft Access 97 and 7.0. The label
will no longer move if the list box is selected and moved to a different
location. The Move Enclosed Control setting no longer exists.
