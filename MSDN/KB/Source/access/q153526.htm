<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates how to convert a replicated database to a
non-replicated database.
<P>
NOTE: There is also a wizard available on Microsoft's World Wide Web
Site on the Internet that will convert a replicated database for you.
The file is Wzrplrgl.mda. It is an add-in for Microsoft Access 7.0 that
enables you to convert the Design Master database from a replica set to
its original, nonreplicated state.
<P>
For more information about how to download this file, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

    Title     : ACC95: Access 7.0 Replica to Regular DB Wizard Available
                on MSL

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To convert a replicated database back to a non-replicated database, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new database.

<P><LI>Import all the objects, except for the tables, from the replicated
   database into the newly created database.

<P><LI>Close the new database, and then open the replicated database.

<P><LI>Click the Queries tab, and then New, and create a new query in Design
   view. Select the first table in the Show Table dialog box. Drag all the
   fields to the Field row, except for the fields that were generated for
   replication (s_Generation, s_Guid, s_Lineage). If your application
   requires one of these fields created by replication, then go ahead and
   add it to the query.

<P><LI>On the Query menu, click Make Table. In the Table Name box, select the
   current table name. Click to select Another Database, and add the
   name of the database that you created in step 1. Run the query.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each table in the replicated database.

<P><LI>Close the replicated database and open the new database. Recreate all
   indexes and relationships that existed in the replicated database.

<P><LI>Once you've completed steps 1-7, compact and then repair the new
   database. The new database should be approximately the same size as
   before replication and will not contain any replication properties.
