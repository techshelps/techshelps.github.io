The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
Microsoft Access provides no built in support to scale a form's size to
match the current screen resolution. A form that you design on a computer
with a video driver resolution of 1024x768 (Super VGA) may appear too large
on computers running at 640x480 (VGA) resolution. A form that you design
using 640x480 resolution may appear too small on computers running at
1024x768 resolution.
<P>
The following information describes where you can obtain two Access Basic
functions, glrScaleForm() and glrResizeForm(), that you can use to
dynamically scale and size a form. The glrScaleForm() function can be
called from the Open event of your form to scale the size of a form to the
current screen resolution when the form loads. The glrResizeForm() can be
called from the Resize event of the form to automatically move and size the
contents of a form proportionally to fit the new dimensions of the form
window.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>glrScaleForm()</h3>
 
<P>
The glrScaleForm() function can be called from the Open event of your form
to automatically scale the form to the current screen resolution.
<P>
<PRE>   Syntax:

      Function glrScaleForm (frm As Form, intX As Integer, intY As Integer)

      frm:  form to be scaled
      intX: horizontal resolution at which the form was designed
      intY: vertical resolution at which the form was designed

   Example:

      Sub Form_Open (Cancel As Integer)
         Dim RetVal
         RetVal = glrScaleForm(Me, 1024, 768)
      End Sub

</PRE><h3>glrResizeForm()</h3>
 
<P>
The glrResizeForm() function can be called from the Resize event of your
form to automatically move and resize the contents proportionally to fit
within the new form window size.
<P>
<PRE>   Syntax:

      Function glrResizeForm (frm As Form, fDoResize As Variant)

      frm:       form to resized
      fDoResize: boolean value indicating if the form should be resized or
                 the information tracked

   Example:

      Sub Form_Resize ()
         Dim RetVal
         RetVal = glrResizeForm(Me, True)
      End Sub

</PRE><h3>How To Obtain The glrScaleForm And glrResizeForm Functions</h3>
 
<P>
The glrScaleForm() and glrResizeForm() functions, written by Ken Getz, are
published in the following book:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Access 2 Developer's Handbook. Ken Getz, Paul Litwin,
   Greg Reddick. Sybex: 1994 ISBN: 0-7821-1327-3

</PRE>Discussion of these function begins on page 506, chapter 8, "Screen
Resolution and Distributing Forms." The functions are included in the file
_Glrfile.exe on the accompanying companion disk. This self-extracting,
compressed file contains the file _Chapter.exe, another self-extracting,
compressed file, which contains the database CH8.mdb. The form
frmTest1280x1024 in CH8.mdb demonstrates the use of these functions. Check
the "Enable Automatic Resizing?" check box in the upper left hand corner of
the form frmTest1280x1024, and then resize the form window to see the
glrResizeForm() function work.
<P>
These functions were originally published with a column in Smart Access
magazine.
