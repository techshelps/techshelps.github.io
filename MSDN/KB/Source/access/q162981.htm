The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
<LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server version 2.0 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you export tables, queries, or forms that contain OrderBy and Filter
properties to ASP or IDC format, and then browse the exported files in a
Web browser, the recordset is not sorted and it outputs all records.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Filter and OrderBy properties are not used when the SELECT statements
that the Web files use are generated.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are exporting a table or query, create a new query that implements
sorting and criteria in the QBE grid rather than using the OrderBy and
Filter properties. Export the new query.
<P>
If you are exporting a form, create a new query that implements sorting and
criteria in the QBE grid rather than using the OrderBy and Filter
properties of the form. Export a form that is based on the new query.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Please note that IDC files will only display forms in Datasheet view
whereas ASP files have the capability to display forms in single Form view.
For the system requirements to run IDC or ASP files, please refer to the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q159325.htm">Q159325</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC97: Server and Browser Requirements for Publish to Web
               Wizard

</PRE><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
CAUTION: Following the steps in this example will modify the sample
database Northwind.mdb. You may want to back up the Northwind.mdb file
and perform these steps on a copy of the database.
<P>
The following example reproduces the behavior when exporting to IDC. The
same behavior will occur when exporting to ASP.
<P>
<PRE>  1. In Microsoft Access 97, open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

  2. Open the Employees table.

  3. Click the First Name column to select it.

  4. Click the Sort Ascending button on the toolbar.

  5. Close the table and save the changes. The OrderBy property should now
     contain a string appropriate for the sort that was applied.

  6. With the table selected, on the File menu, click Save As/Export.

  7. In the Save As dialog box, click to select "To an External File or
     Database," and then click OK.

  8. In the Save As Type box, select Microsoft IIS 1-2(*.htx; *.idc).

  9. In the File Name box type "Employees.htx" (without the quotation
     marks). Note the folder where the IDC/HTX files will be exported to.
     Make sure the file is exported to a folder with IIS execute
     permissions.

     For more information about configuring Microsoft Internet Information
     Server (IIS) permissions, please refer to the IIS Help Index, and see
     the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

        ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q160754.htm">Q160754</A></B>
        TITLE     : ACC97: Error "HTTP/1.0 403 Access Forbidden" Browsing
                    IDC Page

 10. Click Export. The HTX/IDC Output Options dialog box appears.

 11. In the Data Source Name box, enter the name of a System DSN that
     points to the sample database Northwind.mdb. Click OK. Note that two
     files are created: Employees.idc and Employees.htx.

     For more information about how to define a system DSN, search the Help
     Index for "ODBC, setting up data sources," and see the following
     article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

        ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q159682.htm">Q159682</A></B>
        TITLE     : ACC97: "Data Source Name Not Found" Err Msg Opening Web
                    Page

 12. Type the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in the address box of your Web
     browser to view Employees.IDC. For example, if you saved your IDC/HTX
     files in the scripts directory of your Web Server, type:

        <B>http://&lt;servername&gt;/Scripts/Employees.idc?</B>

     Note that the URL depends upon where your files are located on the Web
     Server.

     The records displayed in the Web browser are not sorted by first name.
