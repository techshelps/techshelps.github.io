The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
You are not prompted for a user name and password as you expect when you
are using ODBC from an application to open a secured Microsoft Access
database.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You have not specified a Microsoft Access workgroup information file
(System.mdw in Microsoft Access version 7.0 or 97, or System.mda in version
1.x and 2.0) to use with the Microsoft Access ODBC data source. The
workgroup information file contains a list of users, groups, and passwords.
<P>
If you do not specify a workgroup information file, ODBC will open your
Microsoft Access database (.mdb) file without a password as a member of the
Users group, with the permissions of the Users group.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Edit the Microsoft Access ODBC data source to use the appropriate Microsoft
Access workgroup information file.
<P>
NOTE: For Microsoft Access 1.x and 2.0, you must have the ODBC Driver Pack
2.0 in order to use these instructions. Earlier Microsoft Access ODBC
drivers do not allow you to specify a workgroup information file in the
setup of your ODBC data source.
<P>
For more information about obtaining the ODBC Driver Pack 2.0, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ODBC/Q125235.htm">Q125235</A></B>
   TITLE     : INF: ODBC Driver Pack 2.0 Fulfillment Kit Q&amp;A

</PRE>Follow these steps to specify a workgroup information file to use in a
Microsoft Access ODBC data source:

<OL><P><LI>Start Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the ODBC icon.

<P><LI>In the ODBC Data Source Administrator box (or Data Sources in Microsoft
   Access 7.0 or earlier), select the Microsoft Access data source you
   are using, and then click Configure (or Setup in version 7.0 or
   earlier).

<P><LI>In the System Database box, click Database.

<P><LI>Click the System Database button.

<P><LI>In the Select System Database box, locate and select the appropriate
   workgroup information file (System.mda or System.mdw).

<P><LI>Click OK, and then close the ODBC Data Source Administrator.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If ODBC opens your Microsoft Access database without a password, this does
not mean that you have circumvented Microsoft Access security.
<P>
Microsoft Access employs user-level security on databases, not share-level
security. In user-level security, you grant permissions to users of your
database resources, such as tables and forms. In share-level security, you
password-protect your resources.
<P>
If ODBC opens your Microsoft Access database without a password, you will
log on to the database as a member of the Users group and will only have
permissions to objects in the database that are available to members of the
Users group.
<P>
If members of the Users group do not have permissions to edit data in a
table, you will not be able to edit that table using ODBC with no
System.mdw file specified.
<P>
In user-level security, the combinations of users and their permissions
define database security. Information about users, groups, and passwords is
stored in a workgroup information file. Information about who has
permissions on database objects is stored with each database in the
Microsoft Access database (.mdb) file.
<P>
Passwords are stored in the workgroup information file, and are used only
to prevent a user from logging on to a database as another user who has
different permissions on database objects. Members of the Users group may
not have permissions to modify data in tables, but a user with a password
may have permissions to modify data in the tables.
