The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
If you change the size of a form in Design view, and then save and close
the form, when you open the form from the Database window, the size of the
form will not reflect the changes you made.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You sized the window that contains the form, not the form itself. A form
has its own dimensions independent of the size of the window the form is
displayed in, so that the form can be printed correctly no matter what size
the window is.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are several methods of changing a form's size, including the
following:

<UL><LI>Set the form's AutoResize property to No. This will cause the Form
   window to open to the size you set it to, rather than snapping to the
   size of the form contained within it.

<LI>Set the form's Width property to the width you want.

<LI>Set the form section's Height property to the height you want for that
   section.

<LI>Use the mouse to drag the right side of the form to make the form the
   width you want.

<LI>Use the mouse to drag the bottom of the form or section to make the form
   or section the height you want.
<P>
</UL>Note that you cannot size the width of the form narrower than the reach of
the rightmost control on the form. You cannot size the height of a section
shorter than the reach of the last control in the section.
<P>
NOTE: If you view the form in Form view directly from Design view, the Form
window will remain the same size it was in Design view. You can force the
Form window to snap to the size of the form by choosing Size To Fit Form
from the Window menu when you are viewing the form in Form view.
<P>
If you open the form in Form view from the Database window, the Form window
will snap to the size of the form automatically.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new, blank form. Note that the white area of the detail
   section is 5 inches wide and 1 inch tall.

<P><LI>Drag the Form window to make it narrower than 5 inches wide.

<P><LI>Save the form with any unique filename, and then close the form.

<P><LI>In the Database window, select the form and then choose Open.
<P>
   The form will open 5 inches wide and 1 inch tall.
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about sizing forms, type "sizing forms" in the Office
Assistant, click Search, and then click to view "Set the size of a form
when it's first opened" or "Size a form to fit its contents."
