1. Q. Is there an easy way for me to remove all or part of
      Microsoft Access from my computer?

   A. Microsoft Access Setup now has a maintenance mode for adding or
      removing Microsoft Access components. After you originally
      install Microsoft Access, Setup automatically runs in
      maintenance mode. To remove the entire Microsoft Access program
      from your hard disk, start Setup and then choose the Remove All
      button. Setup will remove the Microsoft Access program and the
      associated icons in Program Manager, but will not remove the
      Microsoft Access directory, the Program Manager group, user-
      created  .MDB and .LDB files, or shared .DLL files in the
      WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

      To change specific components, choose the Add/Remove button in
      Setup. Select the check box for any component you want to add,
      or clear the check box for any component you want to remove.
      Setup prompts you to verify the components you are removing. If
      a selected component is already installed, Setup does not
      reinstall it. To reinstall a component, you must first remove
      the component and then install it. An example is available in
      the fax or mail copy of this script.

      For example, to reinstall the sample database NWIND.MDB, use
      the following 10 steps:

      1. Start Microsoft Access Setup.

      2. Choose Add/Remove.

      3. In the Options box, select Sample Apps, and then choose
         Change Option.

      4. Clear the Northwind Traders check box, and then
         choose OK.

      5. Choose Continue, and then choose Yes when you are
         prompted to confirm that you want to remove the component.

      6. Start Setup again after it finishes.

      7. Choose Add/Remove.

      8. In the Options box, choose Sample Apps, and then choose
          Change Option.

      9. Select the Northwind Traders check box, and then
         choose OK.

      10. Choose Continue.

2. Q. Why does the Microsoft Access Setup program not complete
      successfully?

   A. There are several things that may prevent the Microsoft Access
      Setup program from completing successfully. Four
      troubleshooting tips are available in the fax or mail copy of
      this script.

       1. Make sure you have enough free disk space. Disk-compression
          utilities, such as DoubleSpace, make your hard disk seem
          larger than it actually is by compressing the files on the
          disk. However, if you set the DoubleSpace compression ratio
          for your hard disk to 16 to 1, you might see 160 MB of free
          space where there is actually only 10 MB of space available.

       2. Make sure that your problem is not due to a bad installation
          disk by copying the disk to an empty directory on your hard
          disk. If the disk can be copied with no errors, then the
          disk is not bad. If you do receive an error message when you
          are copying the disk, obtain a replacement disk by calling
          Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400.

       3. Make sure that the PATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
          includes the complete path to your Windows directory,
          including the drive letter. For example, if your Windows
          directory is named WINDOWS and is on drive C, your PATH
          statement must include:

             path=c:\windows;c:\dos

          IMPORTANT: If you change the PATH statement, you must
          restart your computer before the change takes effect.

       4. In your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, include only the
          devices or drivers necessary to run Windows and your
          computer. Remove any third-party memory managers and virus-
          checking software. In Windows, close all other applications,
          including virus-checking software and screen savers, before
          you run Microsoft Access Setup.

       For additional information about configuring your CONFIG.SYS
       and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and troubleshooting Setup problems, you
       can order item number <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q96109.htm">Q96109</A></B> by selecting the FastTips
       Technical Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.

3. Q. Can I install Microsoft Access 2.0 over my current
      installation of Microsoft Access version 1.x?

   A. Microsoft Access 2.0 is designed to install over Microsoft
      Access 1.x files. However, to avoid any potential naming
      conflicts among database files, you may want to install
      Microsoft Access 2.0 in a new directory, or at least back up
      your existing database files before running Setup. Install
      Microsoft Access 2.0 in a different directory if you want to
      retain your previous version of Microsoft Access.

      If you plan to create or modify databases that are compatible
      with Microsoft Access 1.x, you should install Microsoft Access
      2.0 in a different directory. Once you convert a version 1.x
      database to version 2.0, you will not be able to open that
      database in version 1.x again. Microsoft Access 2.0 can open
      version 1.x databases and modify the data, but will not allow
      you to create new objects or modify existing objects. To do
      this, you must convert the database to version 2.0.

4. Q. How do I set up Microsoft Access 2.0 for shared use on a
      network?

   A. Network installation is a two-step process. First, install
      Microsoft Access on the network file server by running the
      administrator Setup command SETUP /A from the Setup disk. Next,
      set up each workstation by running Setup from the network file
      server. Note that there is no SETUP /N command to set up
      workstations as there was in Microsoft Access version 1.x.

      When you are setting up the workstations, you can choose to
      install Microsoft Access on each workstation's hard disk, or to
      set up the workstations to run Microsoft Access from the file
      server. If your network supports the universal naming
      convention (UNC), it is best to start the workstation Setup
      using the UNC path.  Doing this eliminates possible future
      problems with incorrect network drive letter references. In
      addition, you can create custom scripts to set up workstations
      "silently," or without input from the users.

      For detailed network installation instructions, see the
      ACREADME.HLP file that is shipped with Microsoft Access.

5. Q. My validation rules worked correctly in Microsoft Access
      version 1.x, but when I convert my version 1.x database to
      version 2.0, I receive an error message and a Convert Error
      table is created. Why is this?

   A. In Microsoft Access 2.0, validation rules are enforced whenever
      you add or edit data. Because validation rules are always
      enforced, the following items are not valid in default values
      or field-level validation rules:

       - References to fields or controls.

       - User-defined functions.

       - Microsoft Access domain functions.

       - Aggregate functions.

       - CurrentUser() or Eval() functions.

      For additional information about validation rules, you can
      order item number Q&lt;srx940128000575&gt; by selecting the FastTips
      Technical Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.

6. Q. Are there any changes that I should be aware of when I
      convert my database from version 1.x to version 2.0?

   A. Microsoft Access 2.0 contains many changes and new features.
      For specific information about these items, refer to:

       - Microsoft Access "User's Guide", version 2.0, "What's New
         in Version 2.0" section

       - Microsoft Access "User's Guide", version 2.0, Chapter 1,
         "Setting Up Microsoft Access"

       - Microsoft Access "Building Applications", version 2.0,
         Appendix C

       - The ACREADME.HLP file that is shipped with Microsoft Access

7. Q. Why am I unable to create new objects when I open my
      Microsoft Access version 1.x database in Microsoft Access 2.0?

   A. When you open a Microsoft Access version 1.x database in
      Microsoft Access 2.0, you can add or modify data, but you
      cannot create new objects or modify the design of existing
      objects.

      To create new objects or modify the design of existing objects,
      you must first convert your version 1.x database to version
      2.0. To do this, make sure that there are no databases open in
      Microsoft Access, then choose Convert from the File menu. You
      will be prompted for the name of the database to convert and a
      new name for the converted database. Note that if you convert
      your database to version 2.0, it cannot be opened again in
      version 1.x.

      For additional information about database conversion, see the
      Microsoft Access "User's Guide," version 2.0, Chapter 1,
      "Setting Up Microsoft Access."

8. Q. Can Microsoft Access version 1.x read a version 2.0
      database?

   A. Microsoft Access 1.x cannot read a version 2.0 database. Also,
      you cannot convert a Microsoft Access 2.0 database to version
      1.x format. You can export your version 2.0 tables to a 1.x
      database, but because of all the new features in version 2.0,
      you cannot convert any other objects. Therefore, be sure to
      keep 1.x versions of your databases until you have upgraded all
      of your users to version 2.0.

      For more information about using version 1.x databases in
      version 2.0, see the Microsoft Access "User's Guide", version
      2.0, Chapter 1, "Setting Up Microsoft Access."

9. Q. How much hard disk space is required to install Microsoft
      Access 2.0?

   A. The Microsoft Access Setup program has three installation
      options, each having different disk space requirements. The
      space needed for each option is listed below:

       - Typical. For a Typical installation, you need approximately
         19 MB of disk space (15 MB in the Microsoft Access
         directory, plus 4 MB in the Windows directory).

         NOTE: The Typical installation installs all of the Microsoft
         Access components except for Open Database Connectivity
         (ODBC). To install ODBC, you must choose the Complete/Custom
         option.

       - Complete/Custom. For a Complete installation, you need
         approximately 20 MB of disk space (15 MB in the Microsoft
         Access directory, plus 5 MB in the Windows directory).

       - Laptop/Minimum. For a Laptop/Minimum installation, you need
         approximately 5 MB of disk space (4.5 MB in the Microsoft
         Access directory, plus 0.5 MB in the Windows directory).
