<PRE>1. Q. How can I create an expression to extract a portion of a text
      field?

   A. To extract a portion of a text field, use expressions that
      contain the Left(), Right(), InStr(), and Mid() functions.
      These expressions are commonly used in the Update To line of an
      update query to place a portion of a larger field into a new
      field.

      For example, to extract the name "John" from a field containing
      the name "John Doe," use the following expression:

          Left([FullName],InStr(1,[FullName]," ")-1)

      and to extract the name "Doe" from the name "John Doe," use the
      following expression:

          Right(Trim([FullName]),Len(Trim([FullName]))-
          InStr(1,[FullName]," "))

      For additional information about parsing character strings,
      order item number <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q115915.htm">Q115915</A></B> by selecting the FastTips Technical
      Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.

2. Q. How can I create an expression to return a value from a table
      or query using the DLookup() function?

   A. With the DLookup() function, you can return a value from a
      specified set of records, such as a table or query. The syntax
      of the Dlookup() function is as follows:

          DLookup(&lt;expression&gt;, &lt;domain&gt; [, &lt;criteria&gt;] )

      The function has the following three arguments:

       - &lt;Expression&gt;: Identifies the field that contains the data in
         the domain that you want returned

       - &lt;Domain&gt;: Identifies the table or query that contains the
         data you want returned

       - &lt;Criteria&gt;: An optional string expression, similar to a WHERE
         clause in an SQL statement, that restricts the range of data
         used in the function

      The DLookup() function returns one value from a single field
      even if more than one record satisfies the criteria. If no
      record satisfies the criteria or if the domain contains no
      records, the DLookup() function returns a null.

      For additional information about using the DLookup() function,
      order item number <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q136122.htm">Q136122</A></B> by selecting the FastTips Technical
      Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.

3. Q. How can I calculate date/time data to display specific dates or
      elapsed time?

   A. Microsoft Access stores the Date/Time data type as a double-
      precision, floating-point number (up to 15 decimal places). The
      integer portion of the double-precision number represents the
      date; the decimal portion represents the time. Because a
      date/time value is stored as a double-precision number, you may
      receive incorrect formatting results when you try to display
      specific dates or calculate elapsed time greater than 24 hours.

      For additional information about calculating date/time data,
      order item number <B><A HREF="../vbapps/Q88657.htm">Q88657</A></B> by selecting the FastTips Technical
      Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.

4. Q. How do I create synchronized combo boxes?

   A. With synchronized combo boxes, you can make a selection in
      combo box 1, which then filters combo box 2 to list only items
      related to the selection in combo box 1. For a detailed example
      of creating synchronized combo boxes, order item number <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q98660.htm">Q98660</A></B>
      by selecting the FastTips Technical Library option from the
      FastTips Main Menu.

5. Q. Can I open multiple copies of the same form?

   A. Yes, in Microsoft Access for Windows 95, you can open multiple
      instances of the same form. Opening multiple instances of a
      form gives you the flexibility to work on more than one record
      at once. For example, in an Order Entry program, you can start
      taking an order, pause and take a second order, and then return
      to the first order without losing any data.

      For additional information about opening multiple instances of
      a form, order item number <B><A HREF="../vbapps/Q135369.htm">Q135369</A></B> by selecting the FastTips
      Technical Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.
