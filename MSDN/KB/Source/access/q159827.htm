<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article describes the concept of lightweight objects and provides a
technique to create a lightweight switchboard form in Microsoft Access 97
that uses the Hyperlink properties of form controls to open other objects
in the database.
<P>
NOTE: A demonstration of the technique used in this article can be seen
in the sample file, FrmSmp97.exe. For information about how to obtain
this sample file, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : ACC97: Microsoft Access 97 Sample Forms Available on MSL

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access 97 introduces the concept of lightweight forms and
reports, which are objects that do not contain a class module. One
advantage of lightweight objects is that they are smaller and typically
load and are displayed faster than objects with class modules. Another
advantage is that they help decrease the size of your database because they
do not require storage space for a class module. Possible disadvantages of
using lightweight objects is that they do not appear in the Object Browser,
and you cannot use the New keyword to create a new instance of the object.
<P>
When you create a new form or report, it is a lightweight object by
default. Microsoft Access 97 only creates a class module for the object if
you do any of the following:

<UL><LI>Add Visual Basic code to an Event property in the object.

<LI>Open the object in Design view, and then click Code on the View menu.

<LI>Set the HasModule property of the form to Yes.
<P>
</UL>Note that you can still use macros in lightweight objects, as well as
public procedures that exist in standard modules.
<P>
You can convert an object with a class module into a lightweight object by
setting its HasModule property to No, and then saving the object. Do so
with caution, however, because once you save the object, its class module
and any code it contains are deleted.
<P>
By using the Hyperlink property of command button controls, label controls,
and image controls, you can create a lightweight switchboard form in your
database that does not use any Visual Basic code or macros.
<P>
The following example creates a switchboard form that demonstrates the use
of hyperlinks to open database objects:

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Create the following new form not based on any table or query in Design
   view:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Form: MySwitchboard
      --------------------------------------
      Caption: Main Menu
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Command button:
<PRE></PRE>         Name: OpenEmp
         Caption: Employees Form
         HyperlinkSubAddress: Form Employees
      Label:
         Name: OpenCat
         Caption: Catalog Report
         HyperlinkSubAddress: Report Catalog
      Image:
         Name: OpenSales
         Picture: C:\Windows\Circles.bmp
         PictureType: Embedded
         SizeMode: Clip
         PictureAlignment: Center
         PictureTiling: No
         HyperlinkSubAddress: Query Category Sales for 1995

   NOTE: If you do not have the file C:\Windows\Circles.bmp, you can
   substitute another bitmap or graphic file on your computer in the
   Picture property above.

   Note that the HasModule property of the form is set to No. That is how
   you can tell this is a lightweight form.

</PRE><P><LI>Save the MySwitchboard form, and then open it in Form view.

<P><LI>Click the Employees Form button, the Catalog Report label, and the
   image control and note that each one opens the object specified in
   its HyperlinkSubAddress property.
