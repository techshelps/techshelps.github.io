<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information appears in the Database Access Component Issues
topic that is included on the Readme.HTM that comes with IIS:
<P>
<PRE>   For performance and reliability reasons, we strongly recommend the use
   of Microsoft SQL Server for the deployment of production-quality Web
   applications. Although Active Server Pages works with any ODBC-compliant
   database, it has been extensively tested and is designed to work with
   Microsoft SQL Server. ASP also supports Microsoft Access as a valid data
   source. Although the sample Web site and examples in this release use
   Microsoft Access, we recommend that Microsoft Access be used solely for
   development purposes and not for production. Microsoft Access was
   designed as a single-user desktop database, and not for server use.
   When multiple, concurrent users make requests of a Microsoft Access
   database, unpredictable results may occur.

</PRE>The sentence that states "Microsoft Access was designed as a single-user
desktop database" is incorrect.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following Microsoft Access Help topic "Share a database on a network"
explains how Microsoft Access can be used in a multi-user environment:
<P>
<PRE>   If your computer is connected to a network, you and others can work with
   one database at the same time. There are several ways you can share data
   in a multiuser environment.

   Share the entire database
   -------------------------

   You can put the entire database on a network server or in a shared
   folder. This is the easiest method to implement. Everyone shares the
   data and uses the same forms, reports, queries, macros, and modules. Use
   this strategy if you want to use the database the same way or you can't
   afford to support users creating their own objects.

   Share only the tables in the database
   -------------------------------------

   You can put only the tables on a network server, and keep other database
   objects on users' computers. In this case, the database's performance is
   faster because only data is sent across the network. Also, users can
   customize their forms, reports, and other objects for their individual
   needs and preferences without affecting other users.

   You can separate the tables from the other database objects by using the
   Database Splitter Wizard.

   Share the database on the Internet
   ----------------------------------

   You can easily turn your Access objects into World Wide Web (the Web)
   pages. This can be as simple as exporting an object, such as a form or
   table, to HTML, or as elaborate as publishing your data and application
   on the Web using the Publish to the Web Wizard.

   Replicate the database
   ----------------------

   If you use two computers, such as an office computer and a portable
   computer, you can use Microsoft Windows Briefcase to make replicas of
   your Microsoft Access database and to keep those replicas synchronized.
   Also, several users at different locations can work on their own copies
   at the same time and then synchronize them over the network, either
   through a dial-up connection or the Internet.

   Create a client/server application
   ----------------------------------

   If you work in a client/server environment, you can take advantage of
   the extra power and security it provides by creating a client/server
   application. For more information, see Chapter 19, "Developing
   Client/Server Applications," in Building Applications with Microsoft
   Access 97.
