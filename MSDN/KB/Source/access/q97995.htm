The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Incorrect data appears in tables when multiple users load and modify
the same database within minutes of each other.
<P>
The steps below describe a typical scenario in which this problem
occurs:

<OL><P><LI>User1 opens a table in a database.

<P><LI>User2 opens the same database and makes a change to the design of
   the table User1 has open.

<P><LI>Less than one minute later, User1 makes a change to the design of
   the same table.
<P>
</OL>Either user may then notice data corruption in the table. Corruption
problems may be apparent in one of the following three ways:

<UL><LI>Data from one field in the table may be displayed in a new field.

<LI>Data in a new or changed field may be displayed in a second field.

<LI>Attempting to copy the table containing new or changed fields
   generates an error message.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem, called cross-linking, occurs because information about
tables in a database is read from the system tables and is cached into
memory by Microsoft Access when a user opens a database. The information
in a user's cache may become obsolete if another person
has just made a change and Microsoft Access does not read the new
information before the first user makes changes. For example, in the
situation above, User1 has cached the information for the table, User2
makes a change, and then User1 makes a change before the system tables
are reread. If this occurs, the table can become corrupted.
<P>
It is not necessary for both users to open or change the same table
for corruption to occur. The information for the table opened by User1
may be on the same page in the system table as the information for the
table modified by User2. If that page is cached by Microsoft Access,
table corruption may occur.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Information in the cache for tables not currently in use is discarded
on a regular basis, so problems do not occur unless changes are made
before Microsoft Access has had an opportunity to empty the cache. To
ensure that information in the cache is emptied, wait a minimum of one
to two minutes before opening the table in Design view.
<P>
If the database is corrupted, compacting the affected database usually
corrects the problem. To do this, close all databases and choose Compact
Database from the File menu.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access version
1.0. This problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Access version 1.1.
