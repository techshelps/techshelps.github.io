The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you start Microsoft Access version 2.0, the window position and size
may not be the same as it was when you last closed Microsoft Access 2.0.
This behavior is by design. Microsoft Access 2.0 does not have any support
to maintain the window state between sessions.
<P>
This behavior does not occur in Microsoft Access for Windows 95 version
7.0. When you open Microsoft Access 7.0, the window position and size will
be the same as it was when you closed Microsoft Access 7.0. The only
exception to this is when the control box is located off the left side of
the screen before you close Microsoft Access 7.0. In this case, Microsoft
Access 7.0 will open to the same size as it was when you closed it, but
the position will be such that the control box will be visible on the
screen.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows determines where a program appears. Some programs
"remember" if they were maximized, and some keep window state information
relative to the screen and size of a window. Microsoft Access 2.0
"remembers" if it was closed while maximized and will restart that way if
it was.
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 reports and retrieves the window state information
relative to the screen and size of a window from Windows 95. This enables
Microsoft Access 7.0 to restart with those settings. It is by design that
Microsoft Access 7.0 will always open with the control box appearing
within the screen.
