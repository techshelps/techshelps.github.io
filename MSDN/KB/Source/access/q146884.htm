<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When using a replica database, if you synchronize the replica set and
choose not to close and reopen the replica, it is possible to create a
local form (or report) which replaces a replicated form (or report) with
the same name from the Design Master database. This replacing of the
replicated object with a local object in the replica database causes the
object to be different in or mismatched between databases in a synchronized
replica set.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve mismatched local and replicated objects in a synchronized
replica set, follow these steps:
<P>
<PRE>  1. Open the replica database that contains a different local object with
     the same name as a replicated object in the Design Master database.

  2. If you want to save the local object in the replica database, make a
     copy of the object and assign a unique name. If you do not want to
     save the local object, skip to step 4.

  3. Close the replica database.

  4. Open the Design Master database.

  5. Open the replicated object (that was replaced with a local object in
     the replica database) in Design view.

  6. On the File menu, click Save. This causes Microsoft Access to make
     note of a change in the replicated object. The form will be updated in
     every replica the next time the replica set is synchronized.

  7. Close the form.

  8. On the Tools menu, point to Replication, and then click Synchronize
     Now.

  9. Close the Design Master database and open the replica database.

 10. Open the replicated object. Note that the object is no longer
     mismatched; it is the exact same object as in the Design Master
     database.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access version
7.0. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>  1. Create a new database called Master.mdb.

  2. On the Tools menu, point to Replication, and then click Create
     Replica.

  3. In the "This database must be closed before you create a replica"
     box, click Yes.

  4. In the "Microsoft Access can make a backup of your database before
     converting it to a Design Master" box, click Yes.

  5. In the Location Of New Replica box, enter the file name Replica.mdb
     and click OK.

  6. In Master.mdb, create a new form in Design view with the following
     label control:

         Label: Label0
             Caption: Design Master Form

  7. Close and save the form. In the Save As box, enter TestForm as the
     form name, verify that the Make Replicable option is selected, and
     then click OK.

  8. Close Master.mdb and open Replica.mdb.

  9. On the Tools menu, point to Replication, and then click Synchronize
     Now. In the Synchronize Database box, click OK. When asked to close
     and reopen the database (Replica.mdb), click No.

 10. Create a new form in Design View with the following control:

        Label: Label0
           Caption: Replica Form

 11. Close and save the form. In the Save As box, enter TestForm as the
     form name and click OK. When asked if you want to replace the
     existing object with the same name, click Yes.

 12. On the Tools menu, point to Replication, and then click Synchronize
     Now. In the Synchronize Database box, click OK. When asked to close
     and reopen the database (Replica.mdb), click Yes.

 13. Open the TestForm form and note that the label reads "Replica
     database."

 14. Close Replica.mdb and open Master.mdb.

 15. Open the TestForm form and note that the label reads "Design Master
     database." The form called TestForm in Master.mdb is mismatched or
     different from the form called TestForm in Replica.mdb.
