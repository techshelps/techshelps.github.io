The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
By default, a graph sorts the X-axis fields in alphabetical or numeric
order. This article describes two ways to sort the X-axis fields in a
different order.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two ways to change the ordering of fields in a graph. The first
way is to add an Order By clause to the SQL statement in the graph's
RowSource property. The second way is to create a query that orders the
fields the way you want them, and then use the query for the graph's
RowSource property.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Create a Sample Graph</h3>
 
<P>
For Microsoft Access version 2.0:

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database NWIND.MDB.

<P><LI>Create a new, blank form, and then add a graph object to the form.

<P><LI>In the GraphWizard dialog box, select the Sales By Category query as
   the data source for the graph.

<P><LI>Select the Category Name field in the Available Fields box and then
   choose the "&gt;" button. Then select the Product Sales field and choose
   the "&gt;" button. Click Next three times, and then click Finish.

<P><LI>View the form in Form view. Note that the Category Name records are
   listed in alphabetical order.
<P>
</OL>For Microsoft Access version 1.x:

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database NWIND.MDB.

<P><LI>Create a new, blank form, and then add a graph object to the form.

<P><LI>In the Graph Wizard dialog box, select the Sales By Category query as
   the data source for the graph. Then, click the Bar Chart button, and
   then choose Next.

<P><LI>Select the Category Name field in the Available Fields box and then
   choose the "&gt;" button. Then select the Product Sales field and choose
   the "&gt;" button. Choose Next.

<P><LI>Choose Design.

<P><LI>View the form in Form view. Note that the Category Name records are
   listed in alphabetical order.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Change the Graph's Sorting Order</h3>
 
<P>
Method 1:
<P>
The following example demonstrates how to add an Order By clause to the SQL
statement in a graph's RowSource property:

<OL><P><LI>View the form in Design view.

<P><LI>Select the Graph.

<P><LI>From the View menu, choose Properties.

<P><LI>Select the RowSource property, and then press SHIFT+F2 to zoom the
   window. The RowSource property looks like:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SELECT DISTINCTROW [Category Name] AS [Sales by Category],
      SUM([Sales by Category].[Product Sales]) AS [Product Sales]
      FROM [Sales by Category]
      GROUP BY [Category Name];
</PRE>
<P><LI>Type "Order By SUM([Sales by Category].[Product Sales]) desc"
   (without the quotation marks) before the semicolon at the end of
   the SQL statement. The SQL statement should look like:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SELECT DISTINCTROW [Category Name] AS [Sales by Category],
      SUM([Sales by Category].[Product Sales]) AS [Product Sales]
      FROM [Sales by Category]
      GROUP BY [Category Name]
      Order By SUM([Sales by Category].[Product Sales]) desc;
</PRE>
<P><LI>Choose OK.

<P><LI>View the form in Form view. Note that the Category Name records are
   now listed in descending order of sales.
<P>
</OL>Method 2:
<P>
The following example describes how to create and use a query for the
graph's RowSource property:
<P>
For Microsoft Access version 2.0:

<OL><P><LI>Create a form with a graph using the above steps.

<P><LI>View the form in Design view.

<P><LI>With your secondary mouse button, click the graph object, and then
   choose Properties.

<P><LI>With your secondary mouse button, click the Row Source property and
   then choose Build.

<P><LI>For the Product Sales field, change the sort order to Descending.

<P><LI>Close the Query window and save the changes.

<P><LI>Switch to Form view.
<P>
</OL>For Microsoft Access version 1.x:

<OL><P><LI>Create a form with a graph using the above steps.

<P><LI>Make a copy of the Sales By Category query. Call the copy Sales By
   Category 2.

<P><LI>Open the Sales By Category 2 query in Design view. Create the following
   fields in the query:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Field: Sales by Category:Category Name
<PRE></PRE>         Total: Group By
         Sort: &lt;leave blank&gt;
      Field: Product Sales
         Total: Sum
         Sort: Desc

   Note that the first field is named "Sales by Category:Category Name"
   because the name of the first field becomes the graph's title.

</PRE><P><LI>Remove the Product Name field.

<P><LI>Save the query.

<P><LI>View the form in Design view. Replace the SQL text in the graph's
   RowSource property with the Sales By Category 2 query.

<P><LI>View the form in Form view.
<P>
</OL>The columns will be in descending order.
