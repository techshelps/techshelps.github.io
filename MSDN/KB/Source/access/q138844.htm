The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
Microsoft Access version 7.0 has many enhancements for developers, such as
replication, performance analysis, new form design features, improved OLE
support, and Visual Basic for Applications. This article lists the new
product features by the following categories:

<UL><LI>Database Category Innovation
<LI>Forms Design Improvements
<LI>Distributing Solutions
<LI>OLE Support
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 Support
<LI>Language/Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Database Category Innovation</h3>
 
<P>
Briefcase Replication:
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 introduces Briefcase Replication. Using the Windows 95
Briefcase, users work with replicated copies of databases, and then
synchronize changes with the master database. In addition, changes made by
the developer in the Design Master can be propagated to other replicas
through Briefcase. Developers can use data access objects (DAO) to gain
programmatic access to replication.
<P>
Table Analyzer Wizard:
<P>
The Table Analyzer Wizard in Microsoft Access 7.0 can intelligently
decipher flat file data from a wide variety of data formats and create a
relational database that stores the original data but avoids the problems
of non-relational data. The wizard makes recommendations that users can
accept or customize. It then splits the original table into a set of
related tables.
<P>
Performance Analyzer Wizard:
<P>
The Performance Analyzer Wizard in Microsoft Access 7.0 examines databases
and recommends changes to improve application performance. For example, the
wizard might suggest a new index or relationship or a different data type.
Suggested changes can be completed automatically by the wizard or manually
by the developer.
<P>
<P><h2>Forms Design Improvements</h2>
 
<P>
AutoFormat Command:
<P>
Consistent with the other Microsoft Office applications, developers using
Microsoft Access 7.0 can use the AutoFormat command for forms and reports
to quickly deliver great looking results. Developers can save new designs
as AutoFormat templates and then apply those templates to other forms and
reports.
<P>
Button Face Customization:
<P>
Users and developers can define their own custom button faces for toolbar
buttons. They can then use these custom buttons on the standard Microsoft
Access 7.0 toolbars or on customized toolbars.
<P>
Changing Control Types:
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 enables users to change control types on their forms
and reports instantly while maintaining all existing properties. For
example, by using the right mouse button to click a list box control, users
can point to Change To on the menu that appears, and then change (morph)
the list box into a combo box.
<P>
ControlTipText Property:
<P>
Developers can easily add their own screen tips to controls on forms to
communicate the functionality of the control. When the user moves the
pointer over a control that has its ControlTipText property set, text
explaining the control is displayed in a small text box underneath the
control.
<P>
Custom Shortcut Menus:
<P>
Developers can add their own shortcut menus to controls on forms.
<P>
Default Control Types:
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 enables developers to define a default control type
for each field in their database. Microsoft Access then uses that control
type whenever the field is placed on a form. For example, a field could be
set to always appear as a combo box; when that field is dragged onto a
form, a combo box is created for it.
<P>
Improved Form and Report Wizards:
<P>
The second generation Form and Report Wizards are better at anticipating
users' needs. For example, the Form Wizard automatically uses check boxes
for Yes/No fields and text edit regions for memo fields.
<P>
MultiSelect Property with List Boxes:
<P>
Native list box controls in Microsoft Access 7.0 can be either single
select or multiple select.
<P>
Filter By Form and Filter By Selection:
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 introduces a new way for a user to find information by
using a form or datasheet to formulate the query. All tables, queries, and
forms have a Filter By Form mode in which users type the information they
are seeking. Microsoft Access 7.0 then builds the underlying query to
deliver just that data in Form view.
<P>
Import/Export Wizard:
<P>
Users no longer need to figure out how data is structured to bring it into
Microsoft Access 7.0. The new wizard analyzes the target data and enables
the user to decide how it should be imported into the database. Depending
on the type of file being imported, users can define data types and indexes
at the time of import.
<P>
Improved List Box/Combo Box Performance:
<P>
List boxes and combo boxes are now much faster at locating the desired
information.
<P>
Multiple Instances of Forms:
<P>
Developers can programmatically create multiple instances of the same form,
enabling better branching within applications. Each form maintains its own
underlying recordset and can update data independent of other forms. This
allows for applications where, for example, a user is working with one
customer form and needs to pull up additional customer forms. The user can
then switch freely between forms while Microsoft Access 7.0 maintains the
working environment correctly for each form.
<P>
<P><h2>Distributing Solutions</h2>
 
<P>
Improved Setup Wizard:
<P>
The Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit for Windows 95 includes an
improved Setup Wizard for distributing applications. The resulting
applications have a professional Windows setup and do not require users to
purchase a separate copy of Microsoft Access 7.0.
<P>
Database Splitter Wizard:
<P>
The Database Splitter Wizard separates a Microsoft Access 7.0 application
from its tables and creates a new shared database containing the tables for
a multiuser application. This wizard automates a lengthy process that
previously developers had to complete manually.
<P>
Hidden Objects:
<P>
Developers can "unclutter" their applications by hiding objects in the
Database Explorer. There is a new global option on the Tools menu to show
hidden objects.
<P>
Replication Manager:
<P>
The Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit includes a redistributable
Replication Manager, which is a graphical tool used to design, schedule,
and control complex replication scenarios.
<P>
Startup Properties:
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 has startup properties that control how a database is
opened, eliminating the need for Autoexec macros. Application icons,
titles, menu, toolbar defaults, and system hotkeys can all be controlled.
<P>
Windows 95 Help Compiler:
<P>
The Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit contains a new help compiler which
runs in Windows 95 and is fully compatible with the new Windows 95 Help
system.
<P>
<P><h2>OLE Support</h2>
 
<P>
Bundled OLE Controls:
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 includes an 32-bit OLE calendar control that can be
used to select dates quickly without requiring any code. Users drop
this control onto a form and then can select dates. Changes made to data
using the calendar control are then stored in the underlying table. The
Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit also includes an enhanced data outline
control, spinner control, tab control, rich text format (RTF) control, and
other 32-bit OLE controls.
<P>
Databound OLE Controls:
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 supports databound OLE controls and visual data-
binding. This means that a single drag-and-drop operation can connect a
data field to an OLE control. With no code required, the OLE control can
then update data from the underlying table.
<P>
Object Browser:
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 includes an Object Browser that enables developers to
quickly explore an object's hierarchy to find the information that they are
looking for. The Object Browser can also be used to insert precise object
references into code without the developer having to type them.
<P>
OLE Automation Server and Controller:
<P>
In order to automate common database tasks, Microsoft Access 7.0 can drive
(or be driven from) any application that supports OLE Automation, including
Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Visual Basic, and Microsoft Project. This means
that developers will gain programmatic control of Microsoft Access 7.0
components like the reporting engine from outside Microsoft Access 7.0.
<P>
<P><h2>Microsoft Windows 95 Support</h2>
 
<P>
Thirty-two-bit Application:
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 is fully 32-bit and uses the multithreading
capabilities of Windows 95. The Microsoft Jet database engine operates in
its own thread, as do Microsoft Access 7.0 and modules written in Visual
Basic for Applications.
<P>
Database Window:
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 has a new Database window that looks and acts like
Windows 95 Explorer. Views in the Database window include Large Icons,
Small Icons, List, and Details. Users familiar with Microsoft Windows 95
will find the Microsoft Access Database window consistent and
comfortable.
<P>
Database Properties:
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 exposes a variety of database properties that can be
used to locate databases through the Windows 95 Find File feature.
Developers and users can define custom properties that are exposed to the
Windows 95 Find File feature as well.
<P>
Long File Names:
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 supports long file names and UNC (universal naming
convention) paths.
<P>
Windows 95 Shortcuts:
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 users can create shortcuts to their database objects
by dragging an object to the Windows 95 Desktop. Double-clicking the
shortcut opens the database and the object.
<P>
Windows 95 Special Effects:
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 supports the following control special effects from
Windows 95: Sunken, Raised, Etched, Chiseled, Shadowed, and Flat.
<P>
Windows 95 Look and Feel:
<P>
Microsoft Access 7.0 makes use of new Windows 95 controls, such as tab
dialog boxes, option group buttons, and new-style check boxes throughout
the product.
<P>
<P><h2>Language/Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h2>
 
<P>
Visual Basic for Applications:
<P>
Visual Basic for Applications is the new development environment in
Microsoft Access 7.0. Visual Basic for Applications provides a consistent
language for building solutions across Microsoft Office. Code written in
Microsoft Access 7.0 can be used in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Visual
Basic, or Microsoft Project with no changes. A complete, two-volume Visual
Basic for Applications reference is included with the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit.
<P>
Visual Basic for Applications - Code Editor:
<P>
Visual Basic for Applications provides an improved program editor,
including color-coded syntax, a line continuation character, and full
module view, which makes viewing and printing of code easier in Microsoft
Access 7.0.
<P>
Visual Basic for Applications - Improved Debug Window:
<P>
The integrated development environment in Microsoft Access 7.0 makes
debugging easier by providing a persistent Debug window that is available
at the time the code is running. Developers can use this window to inspect
variables, among other things, while their code is running. There is also a
Call Stack button, which shows all currently running procedures. Clicking
a running procedure brings up a Code Editing window for that module.
<P>
Conditional Compilation:
<P>
Developers can set compilation flags in their code to control the resulting
application's behavior. This enables developers to create debug and retail
compilations of their application by setting flags in their code.
<P>
Named Parameters:
<P>
Developers can name parameters for functions enabling cleaner, more
intuitive code viewing.
<P>
Optional Arguments:
<P>
Arguments for functions can be declared as optional, enabling more flexible
functions.
<P>
Parameter Arrays:
<P>
Functions can be defined as having arrays for their parameters. This allows
developers increased flexibility when calling particular functions.
<P>
Custom Form Properties and Methods:
<P>
Visual Basic for Applications enables developers to declare public
functions and properties so that form or report code is callable from other
modules.
