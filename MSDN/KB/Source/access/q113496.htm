The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists all the reserved error codes for Microsoft Access
version 1.1. These error codes are subject to change without notice when
Microsoft Access is upgraded.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you encounter a Reserved Error message, check the Microsoft Knowledge
Base for specific error numbers, since there may be an article with
information about that error code. If you don't find an article about a
specific error, report it to Microsoft Product Support Services; reserved
error messages should not appear in Microsoft Access.
<P>
Some error codes do not have associated messages, because Microsoft did
not expect that these error codes would be encountered.
