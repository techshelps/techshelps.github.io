</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article describes what happens to Microsoft Access groups,
calculations, and labels when you export a report to Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, the fields are laid out in columns with each row
representing a separate record. The Microsoft Access Output To command uses
the Outline feature of Microsoft Excel to format the report's groups.
<P>
<P><h3>Group Headers and Footers</h3>
 
<P>
Unlike groups in Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel outlines have only a
header or a footer, not both. For this reason, all information in the
report's group header is included in the output. Only sums are output from
a report's group footer. To include group information in the output, place
the information in the group header instead of the group footer.
<P>
<P><h3>Sums</h3>
 
<P>
Sums are the only expressions included in the output. When you output sums,
the Output To command uses the Sum formula of Microsoft Excel to represent
the sums. Only sums located in the group footers and the report footers are
included in the output.
<P>
In laying out the Microsoft Excel worksheet, the placement of the sum
depends on the number of sums referencing a field. If there is only one sum
referencing a field, the sum is placed in the same column as the field.
<P>
If there are multiple sums referencing the same field (for example, a sum
in the group footer and in the report footer), all sums are placed in the
column next to the field.
<P>
The Sum formula uses a range formula as part of the calculation. In order
to keep all sums in the same column, the Sum needs to add each group's
range rather than summing the entire range. For example, cells C1 through
C5 are region Alpha and cells C7 through C10 are region Beta. The Sum
formula for Alpha is:
<P>
<PRE>   =Sum(C1:C5)

</PRE>The Sum formula for Beta is:
<P>
<PRE>   =Sum(C7:C10)

</PRE>To get the total, the formula is:
<P>
<PRE>   =Sum(C1:C5)+Sum(C7:C10)

</PRE>With a large number of groups, this formula may be long. Because the Sum
formula includes only values that are numeric, blank cells and cells
containing text are ignored. The formula
<P>
<PRE>   =Sum(C1:C10)

</PRE>gives the same result as:
<P>
<PRE>   =Sum(C1:C5)+Sum(C7:C10)

</PRE><h3>Labels</h3>
 
<P>
Because the Output To command cannot determine if a text box has a label
associated with it, all text boxes have labels when output. The only
exception are sums. Sums do not have labels unless there are multiple sums
referring to the same field.
<P>
The label's caption is set to the name of the control. To control the
caption of the label, set the text box's name to the caption's name.
<P>
