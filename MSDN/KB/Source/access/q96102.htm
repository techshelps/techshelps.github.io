The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You receive the following message even though you have full permission
on a table:
<P>
<PRE>   Couldn't read; no read permission for table or query &lt;query name&gt;

</PRE>You can view the table in Datasheet and Design view, and you can open
the query in Design view.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs when a query has the property Run With Owner's Permissions
checked and the user who created the query (the owner) is no longer on
the system. Either the owner was deleted or the database was opened in a
Microsoft Access session that was started with a different SYSTEM.MDA
where the owner is not a included.
<P>
When the property Run with Owner's Permissions is checked, Microsoft
Access checks the owner's permissions. It does not compare the owner's
permissions to those of the user running the query. Therefore, if the
owner is not on the system, other users cannot execute the query as long
as the property Run with Owner's Permissions is checked.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To allow users to run the query with their own permissions, clear the
Run With Owner's Permissions check box and save the query.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access versions
1.0 and 1.1. This problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Access version 2.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access. If you have activated security, log in as a
    member of the group Admins.

<P><LI>From the Security menu, choose Users.

<P><LI>Press the New button and add a new user called John. Add another user
    called Jane. Do not assign either to any group other than Users.

<P><LI>If you have already activated security, skip this step. Choose Change
    Password... from the Security menu. Leave the Old Password blank, enter
    Admin for New Password and Verify. Press the OK button.

<P><LI>Exit and restart Microsoft Access. Log in as John leaving the password
    blank.

<P><LI>Create a new query based on any table. If you are in a secure system,
    base the query on a table that the Users group has full permissions to.
    From the View menu, choose Query Properties and select the Run with
    Owner's Permissions check box.

<P><LI>Exit and restart Microsoft Access. Log in as Admin using the password
    Admin.

<P><LI>Choose Users from the Security menu. Delete the user John.

<P><LI>Exit and restart Microsoft Access. Log in as Jane leaving the password
    blank.

<P><LI>Attempt to run the query.
<P>
    At this point, you will see the error message "Couldn't read; no read
    permission for table or query '&lt;query name&gt;'.

<P><LI>Verify that Jane can open the query in Design view as well as open the
    table on which the query is based.
<P>
</OL>To avoid the problem, in Design view, the user Jane can choose Options
from the View menu and clear the Run With Owner's Permissions check box.
Depending on the security, that may have to be done by an Admin. After you
clear the check box, the query will run.
<P>

Permissions" using the Microsoft Access Help menu.
