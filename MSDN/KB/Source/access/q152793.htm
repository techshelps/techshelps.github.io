The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft dbWeb version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When the dbWeb Service receives two or more hits at the same time, the
service may stop responding (hang) and display one of the following error
messages:
<P>
<PRE>   CGI Error
   The specified CGI application misbehaved by not returning a complete
   set of HTTP headers. The headers it did return are:
   Catch -- dbWebClient

   -or-

   Request failed
   The network connection encountered an error.
   Please try again later.
   Catch -- dbWebClient

</PRE>This can occur occasionally when you use the Microsoft Access ODBC driver
(Odbcjt32.dll) to connect to Microsoft Access databases for publishing on a
World Wide Web site using dbWeb 1.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a site has two or more concurrent requests, the dbWeb service spawns a
separate execution thread for each request. When a thread is no longer
used, it must be terminated. When the dbWeb service enters a routine to
clean up unused threads generated by the concurrent requests, and
encounters a deadlock, it will not return from a wait state. This causes
the dbWeb CGI client stub program to time out. This behavior can occur with
the Microsoft Access ODBC driver (Odbcjt32.dll).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two workarounds for this problem:

<UL><LI>You can use a client/server database such as Microsoft SQL Server as
   the back-end for your dbWeb site instead of Microsoft Access for
   Windows 95. In general, the ODBC drivers for client/server databases
   are optimized to handle concurrent usage more efficiently than the
   Microsoft Access ODBC driver.

<LI>You can use a batch file to load AT commands executed by the Windows NT
   Server Schedule service to frequently stop and restart the dbWeb
   service. To create the AT commands needed to stop and restart the
   dbWEb service on a regular basis follow these steps:
<P>
   NOTE: This workaround assumes you are familiar with Windows NT
   services, creating batch files, and using AT command codes.
<P>
   NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) at the end
   of a line is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the
   underscore from the end of the line when re-creating this code.
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. Open a text editor, such as Notepad, and open a new file.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. Enter the following lines:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          net stop dbwebservice
          net start dbwebservice

    3. On the File menu, click Save As. Locate the root directory of
       the server and save the file as Strtstop.bat.

    4. On the File menu, click New.

    5. Enter one of the following sets of commands (which are written in
       relation to the server. All directories, menus, and services are
       referenced on the server, which hosts dbWeb):

        - To create a file to load a set of AT commands that stop and
          restart the dbWeb service once an hour every day of the month
          using the Strtstop.bat:

</PRE><P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As. Enter Dbwstop.bat as the file name
    and note the location where it is saved.

<P><LI>Switch to Program Manager and open the Main program group.

<P><LI>Open Control Panel and double-click the Services icon.

<P><LI>In the Services dialog box, follow these steps:
<P>
     a. Click the Schedule service.
<P>
     b. Click the Start button. This action will start the Schedule
<PRE>        service. It is not started by default.

     c. Click the Startup button.

     d. From the Services dialog box, click the Automatic option in the
        Startup Types section.

     e. Click OK to return to the Services dialog box.

     f. Click Close to return to Control Panel.

</PRE><P><LI>Close Control panel and return to the Main program group.

<P><LI>Double-click the MS-DOS icon in the Main group to open an MS-DOS

<P><LI>In the MS-DOS Window, change directories to the location of the
    Dbwstop.bat file created in step 7.

<P><LI>Run the batch file by typing Dbwstop.bat at the command prompt.
    The batch file will echo to the screen that each line was added
    as a task.

<P><LI>Type "exit" (without the quotation marks) at the command prompt to
    close the MS-DOS window and return to Windows NT.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft dbWeb 1.0. This
problem no longer occurs in Microsoft dbWeb version 1.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each command loaded by the Dbwstop.bat file is entered into the Windows NT
Registry. Because each command is a Registry entry, the Dbwstop.bat file is
used only to load AT commands. The Registry values entered are static and
will remain until removed even after the server has been restarted. Setting
the "Schedule Service Startup Type" to Automatic ensures that the Schedule
Service will also restart.
<P>
The examples demonstrated in this article establish a schedule of stopping
and restarting the dbWeb service on a periodic basis. An analysis of the
dbWeb site should be performed to determine the best interval for the stop
and restart to occur. The Stop and Restart action only needs about 4
seconds or so on a 66mhz 486 computer with 32mb RAM. Faster hardware should
perform at least as well.
<P>
Altering the schedule will require you to make additional entries to the
Dbwstop.bat file for shorter intervals between actions or fewer entries for
longer intervals. You can control the interval by altering the time value
immediately following the AT in the command line. Once you make changes to
the Dbwstop.bat file, you must remove any previous schedule (if any) from
the Registry by typing the following command in an MS-DOS window:
<P>
<PRE>   AT /delete

</PRE></OL>NOTE: The "at /delete" command removes all schedule service entries. If any
scheduled events--unrelated to dbWeb--are set, you need to re-enter them
into the schedule. Once you remove the previous entries, you can run the
Dbwstop.bat file again.
<P>
The actions controlled by the Schedule service are performed as background
tasks; they run transparently without any feedback.
