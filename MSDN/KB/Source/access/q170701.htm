The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
Some local objects in a replicated database appear as replicable objects.
That is, they are displayed with the Replicable icon even though they are
not replicable objects.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The user who is currently logged on to Microsoft Access does not have Read
Design permissions for the local object.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 97.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access attempts to retrieve the Replicable property of objects
when a user opens a replicable database. If the user does not have Read
Design permissions for an object, Microsoft Access cannot retrieve its
Replicable property, and cannot determine if it is replicable or not. In
this case, Microsoft Access assumes that the object is replicable and
displays the Replicable icon next to it in the Database window.
<P>
Note that this problem occurs only in the Microsoft Access user interface
and does not affect synchronization with other replicas. The local objects
are not propagated to other members of the replica set during
synchronization.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
IMPORTANT: You should make a backup copy of your workgroup file
(System.mdw) before following the steps below.
<P>
<PRE>  1. Start Microsoft Access 97, but do not open a database.

  2. On the Tools menu, point to Security, and then click User And Group
     Accounts.

  3. Create a new user account and add it to the Admins group.

  4. Remove the Admin user from the Admins group.

  5. Assign the Admin user a password. This will cause Microsoft Access to
     prompt you for a user name and password at startup.

  6. Click OK to close the User And Group Accounts dialog box.

  7. Quit Microsoft Access and restart it.

  8. Log on as the user you created in step 3.

  9. Create a new, blank database.

 10. On the Tools menu, point to Security, and then click User And Group
     Permissions.

 11. Revoke all permissions for New Tables/Queries for the Users group and
     the Admin user.

 12. Click OK to close the User And Group Permissions dialog box.

 13. On the Tools menu, point to Replication, and then click Create
     Replica.

 14. Click Yes when you see a message stating that the database must be
     closed to create a replica.

 15. Click No when prompted to make a backup of the database.

 16. Click Cancel when prompted for the location of the new replica.
     Although a new replica is not created, Microsoft Access will have
     converted your database to a Design Master.

 17. Create a new table with the following fields:

        Table: Table1
        ----------------------------
        Field Name: ID
        Data Type: AutoNumber
        Indexed: Yes (No Duplicates)
        Field Name: Field1
        Data Type: Text

        Table Properties: Table1
        ------------------------
        PrimaryKey: ID

 18. Save the table as Table1. When prompted for the name of the table,
     make sure the Make Replicable check box is not selected.

 19. Quit Microsoft Access and restart it.

 20. Log on as the Admin user using the password that you assigned to the
     Admin user in step 5.

 21. Open the new database that you created in step 9.

     Note that the table you saved as a local object is now displayed with
     a Replicable icon in the Database window.
