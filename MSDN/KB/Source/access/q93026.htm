The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
Users are allowed to edit OLE objects in a database that has been opened
as read-only or in a form that is read-only. However, when a user attempts
to save the record, Microsoft Access displays a message indicating that
the record cannot be updated.
<P>
To prevent users from attempting to edit OLE objects in read-only forms,
set the Enabled property of the object frame to No.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In a read-only database, a user is allowed to edit and update OLE objects
but is not allowed to commit a record with these changes. At the point the
record is committed, the following message appears:
<P>
<PRE> In Microsoft Access 1.x and 2.0
 -------------------------------

   Can't save changes to this object because you don't have
   permission to write to the record. Copy the object to the
   Clipboard if you want to save it, then choose Undo Field.

 In Microsoft Access 7.0
 -----------------------

   Microsoft Access can't save your changes to this bound OLE
   object because you don't have permission to write to the
   record in which the object is stored or the record is locked
   by another user. Copy the object to the Clipboard (select the
   object and click Copy on the Edit menu), and click Undo Current
   Record on the Edit menu. You can then open the application used
   to create the object, paste the object, and save it.

 In Microsoft Access 97
 ----------------------

   Microsoft Access can't save your changes to this bound OLE
   object. Either you don't have permission to write to the
   record in which the object is stored, or the record is locked
   by another user. Copy the object to the Clipboard (select the
   object and click Copy on the Edit menu), and click Undo Current
   Record on the Edit menu. Then open the application you used to
   create the object, paste the object from the Clipboard, and save
   it.

</PRE>The user must undo the changes before the record can be committed. To save
the changes, the user must copy the object to the Clipboard before
clicking the Undo Field.
