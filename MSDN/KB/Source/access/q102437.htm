The information in this article applies to:

</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article lists some techniques that you can use to determine indirect
causes of error messages when using linked (attached) SQL tables:

<OL><P><LI>Check for multiple, corrupted, or outdated copies of the following
   files.
<P>
   In Microsoft Windows versions earlier than Windows 95, use File Manager
   to search for copies of the following files:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ODBC.DLL - dated 10-16-92 or later, with 44736 bytes
      DBNMP3.DLL - dated 9-15-92 or later, with 8241 bytes
      SQLSRVR.DLL - dated 10-16-92 or later, with 135792 bytes
      NETAPI.DLL - depends on the network being used
      COMMDLG.DLL - dated 10-25-92 or later, with 89248 bytes
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: The sizes and dates referenced are correct if the files
      were installed by Microsoft Access versions 1.0 or 2.0.
</PRE><P>
   In Microsoft Windows 95, use Windows Explorer to search for copies of
   the following files:
<P>
<P><PRE>       ODBC32.DLL - dated  9-28-95 or later, with 63000 bytes
       DBNMPNTW.DLL - dated 9-28-95 or later, with 17000 bytes
       SQLSRV32.DLL - dated 9-28-95 or later, with 207000 bytes
       NETAPI32.DLL and NETAPI - depends on the network being used
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       NOTE: The sizes and dates referenced are correct if the
       files were installed by Microsoft Access 7.0 or 97.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Make sure that all the files listed in step 1 are in the
   appropriate locations. All of the files are usually installed
   in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.

<P><LI>Use another application, such as the four listed below, on the
   same computer and try to attach the same data source:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Q+E (comes with Microsoft Excel)
    - SQL Server Administration Facility (SAF)
    - PowerBuilder
    - MSQuery
</PRE><P>
   If you cannot access the data source from another application, you
   may have a problem with the network, not with Microsoft Access or
   the Microsoft Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) driver.

<P><LI>Try to attach another data source, such as another SQL Server
   table, from a different database server. If you can attach the
   other data source, the original server may be unavailable, or you
   may need to reconfigure the entry for that server using the ODBC
   Administration utility.

<P><LI>Try to attach the same data source from a different computer. If
   you still cannot gain access to the SQL Server computer, you may
   have a network-wide problem, or perhaps the server is down or not
   communicating.

<P><LI>Try increasing the ODBC time-out settings in the [ODBC] section of
   your MSACCESS.INI file for Microsoft Access 1.0 and 1.1 (or the
   MSACC20.INI file for Microsoft Access 2.0).
<P>
   NOTE: For Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97, try increasing the ODBCTimeout
   setting on the query's property sheet.

<P><LI>For versions of Microsoft Access 2.0 or earlier, rename the current
   ODBC.DLL, DBNMP3.DLL, and SQLSRVR.DLL files, restart the server, and
   reinstall ODBC.
<P>
   NOTE: For Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97, rename the current ODBC32.DLL,
   DBNMPNTW.DLL and SQLSRV32.DLL files, restart the server, and reinstall
   ODBC.
