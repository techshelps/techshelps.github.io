 1. Q. How have queries changed in Microsoft Access version 2.0?

    A. Queries are now more flexible and are easier to create. The new
       QueryWizards--Crosstab, Find Duplicates, Find Unmatched, and
       Archive--help you quickly create complex queries for managing
       your data.

       There are also three new SQL-specific queries. These are union
       queries, data-definition queries (queries that create, change,
       or delete tables and indexes in Microsoft Access databases),
       and SQL pass-through queries (queries that pass SQL statements
       directly to a SQL database, providing improved connectivity in
       client-server relationships).

       In addition, improvements in updating in multiple-table queries
       and the addition of TopValues queries and subqueries give you
       greater query functionality.

 2. Q. When I add two tables to my query that do not have a
       defined relationship, Microsoft Access automatically joins
       them. Can I prevent this from happening?

    A. Microsoft Access 2.0 automatically joins two tables in a query
       if the tables meet the following criteria:

        - There is no relationship defined between the tables.

        - Each table contains at least one field whose name and data
          type matches the name and data type of a field in the other
          table.

        - One of the tables has a primary key defined on the matching
          field.

       Only one AutoJoin is automatically created between two tables.
       Even if there is more than one join possible between the two
       tables, a join is created only between the first fields that
       meet the above criteria. If you add three tables that meet the
       above criteria to a query, three joins are created--one for
       each table pair.

       You cannot turn this functionality off. You must either delete
       the join line after it is created or manually define a
       relationship between the two tables.

 3. Q. How does the new Relationships window work? What does it
       mean when I am prompted to save the layout?

    A. The new Relationships window gives you a graphical display of
       the tables in your database and their relationships to each
       other. You can customize the Relationships window and view as
       many or as few tables as you want. You can also create or
       change table relationships in this view. For more details about
       the Relationships window, order the fax or mail copy of this
       script.

        - To create a relationship, drag the related field from the
          primary table to the related table. Microsoft Access will
          then display the Relationships dialog box. When you choose
          OK, the relationship is created and saved.

        - Removing (deleting) a table from the Relationships window
          does not delete the table or any of its relationships from
          the database; it simply hides that particular table from
          view.

        - To delete a relationship, select the join line and press the
          DEL key.

        - To make sure that you are seeing all the defined
          relationships in your database, choose Show All from the
          Relationships menu.

        - When you close the Relationships window, you are prompted to
          save the window's layout.  Choosing Yes or No does not
          affect whether your relationships are saved, but only the
          positions of the visible tables in the Relationships window.

        - To show only the relationships for a specific table, use the
          following three steps:

          1. From the Edit menu, choose Clear Layout, and then choose
             OK when you are prompted. Note that this clears the
             layout only and does not delete existing relationships.

          2. From the Relationships menu, choose Add Table. In the
             Table/Query box, select the table whose relationships you
             want to see, and then choose Add. Choose Close.

          3. From the Relationships menu, choose Show Direct.

             NOTE: If you do not clear the layout before choosing Show
             Direct, the relationships for the table you selected will
             be displayed in addition to any other relationships that
             are already being displayed.

 4. Q. Why can I update more fields in my query than I could in
       Microsoft Access version 1.x?

    A. In Microsoft Access 2.0, when a query includes fields from more
       than one related table, you can update data on both sides of
       the join. This means that in a query that combines data from
       two tables, you can update data from both of the tables in the
       query.

       If you want to prevent users from updating fields in a multiple-
       table query, create a form based on the query and then set the
       Locked property for the fields you do not want users to update.

       For more information about updating queries, search for
       "queries: updating underlying tables" and then view both of the
       related topics using the Microsoft Access Help menu.

 5. Q. How have validation rules and default values changed?

    A. In Microsoft Access 2.0, validation rules are always enforced,
       no matter how you add or edit data. Because default values and
       validation rules are always enforced, the following items are
       not valid in default values or field-level validation rules:

        - References to fields or controls. Instead, use record
          validation rules when you are comparing two or more fields.
          For more information about record validation rules, search
          for "validation: rules and text" then "Validating Data in a
          Table" using the Microsoft Access Help menu.

        - User-defined functions.

        - Microsoft Access domain functions.

        - Aggregate functions.

        - CurrentUser() or Eval() functions.

 6. Q. Why can't I set referential integrity?

    A. Referential integrity is a set of rules that preserves the
       defined relationships between tables when you enter or delete
       records. If you enforce referential integrity, you cannot add a
       record to a related table when there is no associated record in
       the primary table, change a value in a primary table that would
       result in an orphan record in a related table, or delete a
       record from a primary table when there is a matching related
       record.

       If you select the Cascade Update Related Fields or Cascade
       Delete Related Records option for a relationship, Microsoft
       Access will change or delete related records to ensure that the
       referential integrity rules are enforced when you change or
       delete records.

       There are several possible reasons why you can't enforce
       referential integrity when you are defining a relationship. For
       additional information, you can order item number <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q112111.htm">Q112111</A></B> by
       selecting the FastTips Technical Library option from the
       FastTips Main Menu.

 7. Q. How can I optimize my queries?

    A. Microsoft Access 2.0 uses Rushmore, a data-access technology
       that permits sets of records to be queried very efficiently.
       Here is a summary of query performance tips:

        - Index the fields used in sorts and criteria.

        - Index the fields used in joins in both tables.

        - Use multiple-field indexes on fields where there are
          multiple-column joins between the tables.

        - If a table has a single-field primary key, do not add a
          separate index to the primary key field. If a table has a
          multiple-field primary key, it may help to have a separate
          index on each field.

        - Use outer joins only when necessary--outer joins limit the
          options for the query optimizer.

       For more information about query performance, search for
       "Rushmore technology" then "Optimizing Queries with Rushmore
       Technology" using the Microsoft Access Help menu. Or, you can
       order item number <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q112112.htm">Q112112</A></B> by selecting the FastTips Technical
       Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.

 8. Q. Why do I see a number instead of "(counter)" for my
       counter field?

    A. Microsoft Access 2.0 enters a counter value when you start to
       edit a new record. In Microsoft Access 1.x, this value was
       entered after you saved the record.

       Since this value is now provided earlier, if you start editing
       a new record and then cancel the record, the counter value is
       still used, even though no record is stored with the value. For
       example, when you add a new record to a table containing two
       records, the counter value is 3. If you cancel this new record
       and then later add another new record, the counter value is 4
       for the new record.

       Counter values are not reused when you delete records. For
       example, if in a table of 15 records you delete the last three
       records and then add a new record, the counter value for the
       new record is 16. To reset the next available counter value,
       compact the database. After the database is compacted, the next
       available counter is set to one higher than the last counter
       value in the table.

       For additional information about counters, you can order item
       number <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q112160.htm">Q112160</A></B> by selecting the FastTips Technical Library
       option from the FastTips Main Menu.

 9. Q. While I was creating a query, when I switched from a
       Select query to a SQL Specific query, the SQL statement
       disappeared. When I switched back to a Select query, my query
       disappeared. Where did my query go?

    A. When you switch to a SQL Specific query, the SQL statement from
       the existing query is deleted. If you want to start with a
       Select query to help create the SQL statement for a SQL
       Specific query (to save some typing) use the following six
       steps:

       1. Create the Select query.

       2. From the View menu, choose SQL.

       3. Select the entire SQL statement, except for the ending
          semicolon.

       4. Copy the selected text to the Clipboard by pressing CTRL+C,
          or by choosing Copy from the Edit menu.

       5. From the Query menu, choose SQL Specific, then choose a
          query type.

       6. Paste the query text into the Query window by pressing
          CTRL+V, or by choosing Paste from the Edit menu.

10. Q. How do I remove the underline characters in my input
       masks?

    A. An input mask consists of up to three parts, separated by
       semicolons. The first part specifies the input mask itself, the
       second part specifies whether Microsoft Access stores the
       literal display characters in the table when you enter data,
       and the third part specifies the character that Microsoft
       Access displays in the input mask for spaces.

       If you omit the third part, Microsoft Access uses an underline
       character for the input mask. For example, in the Customers
       table in the sample database NWIND.MDB, the input mask on the
       Customer ID field is:

          &gt;LLLLL

       When you enter data in a new record, five underlines are
       displayed in the field. You can replace these underlines with
       spaces by using the following for the input mask:

          &gt;LLLLL;;" "

       For more information about input masks, search for "input mask"
       then "Adding an Input Mask" using the Microsoft Access Help
       menu.
