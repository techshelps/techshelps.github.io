The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you convert a Microsoft Access version 1.x or 2.0 database to a
Microsoft Access 7.0 or Microsoft Access 97 database, the conversion
process may display a warning message or stop altogether because of an
incompatibility with new features and enhancements. This article discusses
general troubleshooting tips for the unusual case when Microsoft Access
cannot convert a database successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Compile Errors</h3>
 
<P>
If conversion creates a database, but you receive an error message, such as
"There were compilation errors during the conversion or enabling of this
database," you should compile all modules in the converted database. The
converted database may have changes in syntax from version 1.x or 2.0 that
you must manually change. In rare instances, the conversion utility may
fail to convert some Access Basic code to Visual Basic for Applications
code. For example, it may fail to modify a DoCmd statement
<P>
<PRE>   DoCmd OpenForm "MyForm"

</PRE>into a method of the DoCmd object:
<P>
<PRE>   DoCmd.OpenForm "MyForm"

</PRE>To compile all modules in a converted database, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the converted database in the new version of Microsoft Access.

<P><LI>Open a module in Design view.

<P><LI>On the Debug menu (the Run menu in Microsoft Access 7.0), click Compile
   All Modules.
<P>
</OL>As Microsoft Access compiles your code, it will stop at any line that
contains an error. Then you can modify the syntax to resolve the
compilation error.
<P>
<P><h3>Import Objects</h3>
 
<P>
If the conversion process seems to stop, takes a long time to complete, or
displays an error that prevents the new database from being created, you
can create a new database in Microsoft Access 7.0 or Microsoft Access 97
and import objects (individually or grouped) from the version 1.x or 2.0
database.
<P>
Importing objects into a new database has two benefits:

<UL><LI>You can determine which objects have an incompatibility with the newer
   version of Microsoft Access. If an object fails to import, then you know
   to examine it more closely for a potential incompatibility. If an object
   imports successfully, it is automatically converted to the new version.

<LI>You can speed the conversion process by importing groups of objects.
   If you have a large database, the conversion process may be slow or
   may appear to cause your computer to stop responding. Importing groups
   of objects requires less memory and in some cases may be faster.
<P>
</UL>To use the Import command instead of the Convert Database command, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new Microsoft Access 7.0 or Microsoft Access 97 database.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Get External Data, and then click Import.

<P><LI>In the Import dialog box, make sure to select Microsoft Access (.mdb)
   in the Files Of Type box.

<P><LI>Click the arrow to the right of the Look In box, select the drive and
   folder where the Microsoft Access database (.mdb) you want to import
   is located, and then double-click the database's icon.

<P><LI>Click one or more (up to 20) objects to import.

<P><LI>Click OK to import the selected objects.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 2-6 until all the objects are imported into the new
   database.
<P>
</OL><h3>Reduce Errors</h3>
 
<P>
To help reduce errors during the conversion process:

<UL><LI>Recompile all modules in the Microsoft Access 1.x or 2.0 database
   using Microsoft Access version 1.x or 2.0, and then convert the
   database to the new version. This eliminates any pre-existing compile
   errors that will cause an error message when you convert the database to
   the new version.
<P>
   This may require you to reinstall Microsoft Access 1.x or 2.0 if you
   installed Microsoft Access 7.0 or Microsoft Access 97 into the same
   folder (directory) as version 1.x or 2.0. You may want to reinstall
   Microsoft Access 1.x or 2.0 into a different folder so that you have
   both versions available for resolving any conversion problems.

<LI>Open the database in Microsoft Access version 1.x or 2.0 and look for
   incompatibilities, such as modules called "DAO," "Access," or some other
   type library name.
