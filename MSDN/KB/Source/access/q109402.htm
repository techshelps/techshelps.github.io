The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0 and 1.1
<LI>Microsoft Access Distribution Kit version 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the PrtDevNames property to check or change the currently
connected printing device and port for specific reports.
<P>
The PrtDevNames property is not documented in the Microsoft Access manuals,
but are planned for inclusion in a future release of the program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The PrtDevNames property sets or returns information about the selected
printer. It is a variable-length string that mirrors the DEVNAMES structure
defined in the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit, with the
following components:

<UL><LI>DriverOffset: Specifies the offset from the beginning of the structure
   to a null-terminated string that specifies the filename (without an
   extension) of the device driver. This string is used to set which
   printer is initially displayed in the dialog box.

<LI>DeviceOffset: Specifies the offset from the beginning of the structure
   to the null-terminated string that specifies the name of the device.
   This string cannot exceed 32 bytes in length, including the null
   character, and must be identical to the DeviceName member of the DEVMODE
   structure. You can determine the driver name and device name by looking
   at the [DEVICES] section of the WIN.INI file.

<LI>OutputOffset: Specifies the offset from the beginning of the structure
   to the null-terminated string that specifies the MS-DOS device name for
   the physical output medium (the output port), for example, "LPT1:".

<LI>Default: Specifies whether the strings specified in the DEVNAMES
   structure identify the default printer. On input, if Default is set to 1
   and all of the values in the DEVNAMES structure match the current
   default printer, the selected printer will be set to the default
   printer. On output, Default is set to 1 if the current default printer
   has been selected.
<P>
</UL>Microsoft Access uses the DEVNAMES structure to initialize the Print Setup
dialog box. When you choose the OK button to close the dialog box,
information about the selected printer is returned in the PrtDevNames
property.
<P>
NOTE: You cannot change the PrtDevNames setting without changing the
PrtDevMode setting to your current printer settings. Some Windows printer
drivers assume that the PrtDevMode was created by that driver. If you
select a different printer driver in the PrtDevNames structure without
changing the PrtDevMode structure, Microsoft Access will pass the old
PrtDevMode structure to the new printer driver. This may cause the printer
driver to operate incorrectly and could cause Application Errors.
