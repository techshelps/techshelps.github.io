The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 2.0, 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
The record locks for a form based on a linked Microsoft FoxPro table are
released after a period of time. When this happens, multiple users can
update the same record even though the RecordLocks property of the form is
set to Edited Record.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 2.0 and
7.0. This problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Access 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior does not occur at the table level or if the form is open in
Datasheet view.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>In Microsoft Access 7.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb. Do not open it Exclusive.

<P><LI>Select the Customers table.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As/Export.

<P><LI>Click to select "To an external File or Database," and then click OK.

<P><LI>In the Save Table dialog box, select Microsoft FoxPro 2.6 from the Save
    As Type list, and then click Export.

<P><LI>On the File menu, point to Get External Data, and then click Link
    Tables.

<P><LI>In the Link dialog box, select Microsoft FoxPro from the Files Of Type
    list. Select Customer.dbf, and then click Link.

<P><LI>In the Select Index Files dialog box, click Cancel. Click OK when you
    receive a message that the table is attached, and then click Close in
    the Link dialog box.

<P><LI>Select the attached FoxPro table Customer1. On the Insert menu, click
    AutoForm to create a new form based on that table.

<P><LI>Open the form in Design view. On the View menu, click Properties.

<P><LI>Change the form's RecordLocks property to Edited Record. Save the form
    and close it.

<P><LI>Open the form in Form view and type a letter in the first field.

<P><LI>Start another instance of Microsoft Access 7.0 and open Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>Open the form you created in step 9 and try to type a letter in the
    first field. Notice the lock symbol that appears in the record
    selector.

<P><LI>Leave both forms open for about 5 minutes. At some point the record
    lock symbol will disappear from the second form, and you will be able
    to edit the same record on both forms.
<P>
</OL><h3>In Microsoft Access 2.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database NWIND.MDB. Do not open it Exclusive.

<P><LI>In the Select File dialog box, select the Customer.dbf file, and then
    click Attach.

<P><LI>In the Select Index Files dialog box, click Close. Click OK when you
    get a message that the table is attached, and then click Close in the
    Select File dialog box.

<P><LI>Use the Form Wizard to create an AutoForm based on the attached
    Customer table.

<P><LI>Open the form in Design view. On the View menu, click Properties.

<P><LI>Change the form's RecordLocks property to Edited Record. Save the form
    and close it.

<P><LI>Open the form in Form view and type a letter in the first field.

<P><LI>Start another instance of Microsoft Access 2.0 and open NWIND.MDB.

<P><LI>Open the form you created in step 11 and try to type a letter in the
    first field. Notice the lock symbol that appears in the record
    selector.

<P><LI>Leave both forms open for about 5 minutes. At some point try to type a
