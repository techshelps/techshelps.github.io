      Windows?

   A. You can run Microsoft Access for Windows 95 in Microsoft

      later. Microsoft Access for Windows 95 does not run in earlier
      versions of Windows.

2. Q. What options are installed with a Typical installation?

   A. The following components are installed with a Typical
      installation:

         Microsoft Access

3. Q. How do I add or remove Microsoft Access for Windows 95
      components?

   A. To add or remove components in Windows 95, follow these steps:

      1. Click the Microsoft Windows 95 Start button, point to
         Settings, and then click Control Panel on the menu that
         appears.

      2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon, and then follow
         the instructions in the Install/Uninstall dialog box.

      To add or remove components in Microsoft Windows NT 3.51,
      double-click the Microsoft Access Setup icon in your Microsoft
      Office group (or the group that contains your Microsoft Access
      icons).

4. Q. Should I keep my earlier version of Microsoft Access?

   A. If you plan to create or modify databases that are compatible
      with an earlier version of Microsoft Access, then yes, keep
      your earlier version until you have converted all your
      databases and are comfortable working in Microsoft Access for
      Windows 95.

      For example, if you maintain a database that is shared by
      people who have not yet upgraded to Microsoft Access for
      Windows 95, you need your earlier version to make modifications
      to that database. You can use Microsoft Access for Windows 95
      to open databases created in earlier versions and work with
      data in those databases, but you cannot use Microsoft Access
      for Windows 95 to modify or create objects in a database
      created in an earlier version unless you first convert that
      database to Microsoft Access for Windows 95 format.

5. Q. In Microsoft Access for Windows 95, I chose to open instead of
      convert my database created in an earlier version of Microsoft
      Access. Why did the file size change?

   A. Microsoft Access for Windows 95 supports the Visual Basic(R)
      for applications language that is common to some Microsoft
      Office programs. In order to use a 1.x or 2.0 database without
      changing its format, Microsoft Access creates a new system
      table to hold the Visual Basic translation of the database's
      Access Basic procedures. With this new system table, you can
      run your application in Microsoft Access for Windows 95 without
      having to convert your database.

      For additional information about using 1.x and 2.0 databases in
      Microsoft Access for Windows 95, order item number <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q136131.htm">Q136131</A></B> by
      selecting the FastTips Technical Library option from the
      FastTips Main Menu.

6. Q. Why did my Access Basic DoCmd statements not convert correctly?

   A. During the conversion of your Microsoft Access 2.0 database,
      you may receive a message that states, "There were compilation
      errors during the conversion or enabling of this database,"
      and some of your DoCmd statements are not converted to use the
      new DoCmd object.

      The most common cause of this error message is that some of
      your Microsoft Access 2.0 modules were not compiled. To resolve
      the problem, open the database in Microsoft Access 2.0, open
      all the form and report modules that contain Access Basic code,
      and click Compile Loaded Modules on the Run menu. Then,
      reconvert your database to Microsoft Access for Windows 95.

      For additional information about conversion issues, order item
      number <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q136133.htm">Q136133</A></B> by selecting the FastTips Technical Library
      option from the FastTips Main Menu. You can also find
      information in "Building Applications with Microsoft Access for
      Windows 95", Appendix A, "Converting or Using Applications
      Created in Previous Versions."
