The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
Microsoft Access version 2.0 supports the Object Linking and Embedding
(OLE) specification version 2.0. The OLE 2.0 specification describes a
standard set of interfaces that allow applications to share features.
Applications may provide none, some, or all of this functionality.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Access version 2.0, all the files necessary for
OLE 2.0 functionality are installed and Microsoft Access is registered in
your system as an OLE 2.0 client. If you choose to install Microsoft Graph
during the Microsoft Access installation, it is registered as an OLE 2.0
server application.
<P>
<P><h3>Embedding and Linking</h3>
 
<P>
Objects created in OLE 1.0 and 2.0 servers can be embedded or linked into
Microsoft Access forms, reports, and tables. Microsoft Access supports the
OLE 2.0 standard menus and dialog boxes for inserting and updating objects.
<P>
<P><h3>Visual Editing</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access 2.0 supports in-place editing of OLE objects in a form's
Form view. To prevent in-place editing of an embedded OLE object, set the
Enabled property of the object's frame to No. In-place activation is not
available in a form or report's Design view, or in a table, query, or
form's Datasheet view.
<P>
<P><h3>Drag and Drop</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access 2.0 does not support Drag and Drop across applications.
Drag and Drop is used in Microsoft Access 2.0 to quickly create macro
actions, new controls, and to customize tool bars.
<P>
<P><h3>OLE Automation</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access 2.0 provides full access to the OLE Automation methods
supported by embedded objects through the use of Access Basic.
<P>
<P><h3>Context-Sensitive Menus</h3>
 
<P>
Context-sensitive menus are used extensively in Microsoft Access 2.0 to
provide shortcuts for commonly used commands. This includes access to an
OLE object's object-specific verb menu when you click the secondary mouse
button on an OLE object. When an OLE object is activated in place, mouse
clicks are passed to the OLE object. When the object is not active the
mouse clicks are handled by Microsoft Access.
<P>
<P><h3>OLE Server</h3>
 
<P>
Objects created in Microsoft Access 2.0 cannot be embedded or linked into
other OLE 2.0 applications; Microsoft Access 2.0 is not an OLE 2.0 server.
You can export objects to other Windows applications using a variety of
methods including DDE and the Microsoft Access Export command.
<P>
<P><h3>Conversion and Emulation</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access 2.0 does not have a Convert dialog box. Objects that are
registered to use AutoConversion or Object Type Emulation (also called
"Activate As" or "Treat As") are fully supported by Microsoft Access 2.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Relative Links</h3>
 
<P>
Links in OLE 2.0 maintain both a relative link source reference and an
absolute link source reference. You can take advantage of this
functionality in Microsoft Access 2.0, or you can continue to use the OLE
1.0 behavior in which only absolute link source reference information is
saved. This allows users operating in a heterogeneous environment (where
both Microsoft Access 1.x and 2.0 is used) to share databases. This option
is controlled through an entry in the MSACC20.INI file called
AllowOLE1LinkFormat. The default for this entry is 0, which means that all
OLE 2.0 link tracking information (both the relative and absolute link
source references) is maintained and stored.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about modifying the MSACC20.INI file, search for
"customizing Microsoft Access" then "Customizing MSACC20.INI Settings"
using the Microsoft Access Help menu.
