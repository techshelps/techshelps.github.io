The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
After you synchronize a replica, the data in a Memo field or OLE Object
field in a member of the replica set is missing. Also, a conflict error is
generated.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During synchronization, an error occurred, which prevented the transfer of
data in a Memo field or OLE Object field to one of the replicas.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct the conflict error and restore the data to the Memo or OLE
object field, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the replica that contains the conflict table. In the Resolve
   Replications Conflicts dialog box, click Resolve Conflicts. This button
   is not enabled unless you have opened the replica containing the
   conflict table.

<P><LI>Note that the existing record contains data in the OLE Object or Memo
   field, and that the Conflict record does not contain data in that field.
   Click Keep Existing Record.

<P><LI>When prompted to confirm that you want to keep the existing record,
   click Yes. When you receive a message that you've successfully resolved
   all the conflicts, click OK.

<P><LI>In the Resolve Replication Conflicts dialog box, click Close.

<P><LI>Synchronize with the other member of the replica set.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 97. This
problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Access 97 Service Release 1.
<P>
NOTE: Stand-alone Microsoft Access 97 Service Release 1 is not currently
available, but you can update your copy of Microsoft Access 97 to Service
Release 1 by downloading Microsoft Office Service Release 1 from
Microsoft's Web site at:

<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>  1. Start Microsoft Access and open a new, blank database.

  2. Create a new table named tblTest:

       Table: tblTest
       -----------------------------
       Field Name: ID
         Data Type: Number
         Field Size: Long integer
         Indexed: Yes (No Duplicates)
       Field Name: Notes
         Data Type: Memo

       Table Properties: tblTest
       -------------------------
       PrimaryKey: ID

     Close and save the table as tblTest.

  3. Create a replica of the database.

  4. In the Design Master, enter the following record into the tblTest
     table:

       ID     Notes
       ------------
       1      test

     Close the Design Master.

  5. Open the replica and enter the following record into the tblTest
     table:

       ID     Notes
       ------------
       1      test

  6. Synchronize with the Design Master.

  7. In the Resolve Replication Conflicts dialog box, click View Data
     Errors. Note that the changes you requested were not successful
     because they would create duplicate values in the index, primary
     key, or relationship.

  8. Close the Replication Data Errors dialog box and close the Resolve
     Replication Conflicts dialog box.

  9. Close the replica and open the Design Master.

 10. When the Resolve Replication Conflicts dialog box appears, click
     Close.

 11. Open the tblTest table and change the one existing record as follows:

       ID     Notes
       ------------
       1      test

 12. Close the table and synchronize with the replica. Note that there is
     now a replication conflict in the Design Master.

 13. Close the Resolve Replication Conflicts dialog box and open the
     tblTest table. Note that both records contain data in the Notes field.

 14. Close the Design Master and open the replica. Open the tblTest table.
     Note that in the second record, there is no data in the Notes field.
