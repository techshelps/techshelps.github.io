The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Microsoft Access to a network drive, you receive the
following error message when you try to use Microsoft Graph within
Microsoft Access:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't start object's source application. Use the Windows
   Registration Info Editor (REGEDIT.EXE) to verify that the
   application is properly installed.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Access to a network drive within a Microsoft
Windows session that is running from a network drive as well, the
Microsoft Access Setup program does not insert correct information about
the location of Microsoft Graph in the REG.DAT file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two methods for correcting this problem. Note that both of these
methods should be attempted by a network administrator only, and only under
the following conditions:

<UL><LI>You are using Microsoft Access version 1.x (not version 2.0).

<LI>Windows is installed as a shared network version, with shared files
   on the network as well.

<LI>You installed Microsoft Access on the workstation with the SETUP /N
   command, after installing Microsoft Access on the network with
   the SETUP /A command.

<LI>Graph 3.x is not registered correctly, and you know where the
   MSGRAPH.EXE and MSGRAPH3.REG files are.
<P>
</UL><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Run the Windows Registration Information Editor with the /V switch to
modify the settings for Microsoft Graph. Modify the following two lines in
the REG.DAT file so that they contain the correct drive and path for the
shared GRAPH.EXE file:
<P>
<PRE>   MSGraph\protocol\StdExectute\server=&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;path&gt;\GRAPH.EXE

   MSGraph\protocol\StdFileEditing\server=&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;path&gt;\GRAPH.EXE

</PRE>NOTE: The two lines above are examples only; you must modify them to
point to the location of the shared GRAPH.EXE file.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Modify the Setup files so that an icon is created when you run Setup that
can be used to automatically correct the REG.DAT file to point to the
shared GRAPH.EXE file. This method is useful in that all future
workstations installations from the network will be correct:

<OL><P><LI>Move to the directory that contains the shared copy of GRAPH.EXE. It
    is usually in an MSAPPS\MSGRAPH directory near the shared copy of
    Microsoft Windows.

<P><LI>Copy the MSGRAPH.REG or MSGRAPH3.REG file to a new file called
    MSGRFIX.REG.

<P><LI>Open the MSGRFIX.REG file in Windows Notepad. Modify all the lines
    in the file that point to the GRAPH.EXE file to point to the
    correct drive and path for the shared copy of the file.

<P><LI>Save and then close the MSGRFIX.REG file.

<P><LI>Move to the network MSACCESS\INSTALL directory.

<P><LI>Copy the STFSETUP.IN_ file to a new file called STFSETUP.ORG. The
    STFSETUP.ORG file is a backup file.

<P><LI>Open the STFSETUP.IN_ file in Windows Write (the file is too large
    to open with Notepad). When you are prompted to convert the file to
    Write format, choose No Conversion.

<P><LI>Move to the [ProgGroup Script] section of the file. Locate the line
    that begins with:
<P>
       CreateProgManItem $(AppName), "Microsoft Access Readme"...

<P><LI>Add a new line after the line listed above. The new line should read
    as the sample line below, but modify the drive and path to point to
    the MSGRFIX.REG file created in step 2:
<P>
    NOTE: In the following sample line, an underscore (_) is used as a
    line-continuation character. Remove the underscores at the end of each
    line when re-creating this line.
<P>
       CreateProgManItem $(AppName), "MS Graph Fix", _
<PRE>          "F:\PUBLIC\MSAPPS\MSGRAPH\MSGRFIX.REG", , O

</PRE><P><LI>Save and then close the STFSETUP.IN_ file.

<P><LI>Run the Microsoft Access Setup program with the /N switch again
    (SETUP /N). The Setup program will create a new icon called
    MS Graph Fix.

<P><LI>Double-click the MS Graph Fix icon. The REG.DAT file will be
    updated to point to the correct location for the shared copy
    of the GRAPH.EXE file.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access versions
1.0 and 1.1.
