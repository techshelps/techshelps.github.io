The information in this article applies to:

</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
The SQL Server ODBC driver included with Microsoft Access 1.x and 2.0 is
designed to work with both Microsoft SQL Server and SYBASE SQL Server 4.9x.
<P>
NOTE: The SQL Server ODBC driver included with Microsoft Access for Windows
95 version 7.0 is designed to work with only Microsoft SQL Server. It is
not designed to work with any version of SYBASE SQL Server.
<P>
This article describes requirements for running Microsoft Access versions
1.x and 2.0 with Microsoft SQL Server and SYBASE SQL Server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The SQL Server ODBC driver works with both Microsoft and SYBASE SQL
Servers 4.9x. However, the Microsoft applications that shipped with the SQL
Server driver (Visual Basic version 2.0 and Microsoft Access) were
tested and verified with Microsoft SQL Server only.
<P>
The following sections discuss the issues you should be aware of when
using the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver with SYBASE SQL Server with
Microsoft Access versions 1.x and 2.0.
<P>
<P><h3>ODBC Driver Requires Catalog Stored Procedures</h3>
 
<P>
The ODBC driver requires the catalog stored procedures that ship with
SQL Server version 4.2a. Until the 4.9.1 SYBASE release, these catalog
procedures did not ship with SYBASE servers. To install the procedures,
you must run the INSTCAT.SQL script against the SYBASE server.
<P>
NOTE: Sybase changed the system catalogs in their 4.8 release. Therefore,
SYBASE SQL Server versions 4.8 and later require a modified script called
INSTCAT.48. This revised script is available from Microsoft Product
Support. This script is required with Microsoft Access version 1.0. With
Microsoft Access 1.1 and 2.0, the INSTCAT.SQL file applies to all versions
of Microsoft SQL Server for OS2, as well as to all versions of SYBASE SQL
Server 4.9x. The INSTCAT.SQL file does not apply to Microsoft SQL Server
for NT.
<P>
<P><h3>ODBC Driver Comes with Named Pipe Network Library (Net-Library)</h3>
 
<P>
The SQL Server ODBC driver that ships with Microsoft Access and Visual
Basic 2.0 comes with the Named Pipe Net-Library. To connect to SYBASE,
you need to use the SQL Bridge product or buy the Net-Libraries from
Sybase for each client computer. (The only Sybase Net-Library that has
gone through interoperability testing is the Microsoft TCP/IP Net-Library.)
<P>
Both Microsoft Access and Visual Basic 2.0 use the network in a way that
is atypical of Windows-based applications; they use multiple simultaneous
connections and use asynchronous calls. For this reason, Sybase
Net-Libraries may fail with these products in some network configurations.
Microsoft and Sybase are discussing how best to perform interoperability
testing with the various network configurations supported by Sybase (FTP,
Wollongong, Novell and other TCP/IP, DECnet, and so forth).
<P>
The following is a list of Net-Libraries that Microsoft has confirmed
to work with Microsoft Access/ODBC and SYBASE SQL Server:
<P>
NOTE: An EBF is an Emergency Bug Fix, available from Sybase.

</PRE>NOTE: To use Wollongong Pathway, the files C37603.EXE and C39489.EXE are
required in addition to EBF #1327. This is required by Wollongong Pathway
and is not specific to running ODBC or Microsoft Access.
<P>
Contact Wollongong for more information.
<P>
The two additional files are for the latest version of Wollongong's
Pathway Access, version 2.1.1. (The version number for the run-time
software is 1.2.) The run-time software is shipped with Pathway Access,
but can also be ordered separately from Wollongong. The run-time software
is all that is needed to run Net-Library.
<P>

Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
