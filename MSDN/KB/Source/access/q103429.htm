The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you run a query, a form, or a report based on a query, you may receive
an "Out of Memory" or "Query too Complex" error message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Access 1.x and 2.0, queries must compile within a 64 kilobyte
(K) segment. If you generate a query that is greater than 64K, you may
see either the "Query too Complex," or the "Out of Memory" error message.
In Microsoft Access 7.0 and 97, the 64K limit is replaced by a dynamic
limit which offers much more room; however, it is still possible to make a
query too complex.
<P>
Reports create temporary queries for each section of the report, including
the report header, page header, group header, detail section, group
footer, page footer, and report footer. All of the temporary queries for
each report are combined into a segmented virtual table (SVT). The final
output must be compiled within the 64K segment limit.
<P>
Similar 64K limits are used to compile and store all of the expressions
from page to page when the report is being processed or to store the
unbound controls or label information. If any of these segments exceed the
limit, controls on the report may start displaying the "#Name?" error
message.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
These error messages are related to the complexity of the underlying query
or the report itself. To reduce the complexity of your queries or report,
try the following suggestions:

<UL><LI>Shorten table names, column names, and control names. Reducing a
   30-character name to the minimum length may help.

<LI>Reduce the number of text fields on the report.

<LI>Avoid extra overhead by removing any fields in the underlying query
   that are not used in the final output for the report.

<LI>Reduce expressions in underlying queries. Reducing space used for
   expressions in the select list helps to avoid these errors. If
   possible, place the expressions directly in the report.

<LI>Move complex expressions to a user-defined function that does all the
   evaluating.

<LI>Avoid stacked query objects, such as situations in which Query1 is
   used to pull data from Table2 and Query2 filters the data. Pulling
   information together in one query is preferable to having multiple
   queries, each doing portions of the task.

<LI>Avoid basing main reports and their subreports on the same queries.
   Look for stacked query objects and for tables that are unnecessary
   to the subset.

<LI>Use subreports to break up a complex report into several less
   complicated reports.

<LI>If the report is based on a query, build a temporary table from the
   query to base the report on, instead of basing it on the query. Create a
   make-table query that includes all the fields from the original query to
   build the temporary table.

<LI>Shorten SQL statements by using the Alias property for the field list.
   To do so, on the View menu, click Properties. Click on any field list
   and change the Alias property to something shorter to shorten the SQL
   statement.
