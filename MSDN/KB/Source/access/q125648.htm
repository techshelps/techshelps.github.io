<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates two methods of using the NotInList event to add
a new record to a combo box.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Access Basic and with
creating Microsoft Access applications using the programming tools provided
with Microsoft Access. For more information about Access Basic, please
refer to the "Building Applications" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following examples use the Orders form in the sample database NWIND.MDB
to demonstrate two methods of using the NotInList event to add a record to
a combo box. The first method uses Access Basic code to add a new record
directly to the Customers table when you enter a unique value in the Bill
To combo box on the Orders form. The second method opens the Customers form
when you enter a unique value in the Bill To combo box so that you can add
the new customer information yourself before continuing.
<P>
CAUTION: Following the steps in these examples will modify the sample
database NWIND.MDB. You may want to back up the NWIND.MDB file, or perform
these steps on a copy of the NWIND database.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Using Access Basic Code to Add a Record Directly to a Table</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database NWIND.MDB, and then open the Orders form
   in Design view.

<P><LI>Note that the Bill To combo box's LimitToList property is set to Yes.
   Set the Bill To combo box's OnNotInList property to the following
   event procedure:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Customer_ID_NotInList (NewData As String, Response As Integer)
         Dim DB As Database
         Dim RS As Recordset
         Dim Msg As String
         Dim CR As String: CR = Chr$(13)

         ' Exit Sub if the user cleared the selection.
         If NewData = "" Then Exit Sub

         ' Ask if the user wants to add the new customer.
         Msg = "'" &amp; NewData &amp; "' is not in the list." &amp; CR &amp; CR
         Msg = Msg &amp; "Do you want to add it?"

            ' Customer table.
            On Error Resume Next

            ' Open the Customer table.
            Set DB = DBEngine.Workspaces(0).Databases(0)
            Set RS = DB.OpenRecordset("Customers", DB_OPEN_DYNASET)

            RS.AddNew
               Msg = "Please enter a unique 5-character Customer ID."
               RS![Customer ID] = InputBox(Msg)
               RS![Company Name] = NewData
            RS.Update

            ' If an error occurred while adding the record...
            If Err Then
               ' ...instruct the user to try again.
               Response = DATA_ERRCONTINUE
               Beep: MsgBox Error$, 48
               MsgBox "Please try again."
            Else
