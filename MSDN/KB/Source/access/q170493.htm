The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
A replica that you have deleted or moved still appears in the Synchronize
With list box when you select Replication on the Tools menu and then click
Synchronize Now. The replica also appears in Replication Manager when you
click All Replica Sites on the View menu.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Deleted or moved replicas are not automatically removed from the available
list of replicas that can be synchronized.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to remove a replica that no longer exists from the list of
available replicas, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Replication, then click Synchronize Now.

<P><LI>Select the replica in the Synchronize With list and click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK in the message box that tells you that the replica can't be
   found.

<P><LI>Click Yes in the message box that tells you Microsoft Access has
   deleted the replica and asks if you want to close and reopen the
   database now.
<P>
   Note that in some cases the database does not close; however, the
   replica name is removed from the list. If this happens, click Cancel
   in the Synchronize Database dialog box to reset the database.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Replication, and then click Create Replica.

<P><LI>When the replica is created, note the folder to which Microsoft Access
   copies the replica.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Replication, and then click Synchronize Now.
   Note that the new replica appears in the list of replicas that you can
   synchronize with.

<P><LI>Using Windows Explorer, find the replica and delete it from the folder.

<P><LI>Return to Microsoft Access and on the Tools menu, click Replication,
   and then click Synchronize Now.
<P>
   Note that the replica still appears in the list, and if you try to
   select it, you receive a message that Microsoft Access cannot find the
   replica.
<P>
