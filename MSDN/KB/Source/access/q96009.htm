<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
Screen fonts and printer fonts can be different. When you create a new form
or report, the default font used to format the controls can be set up to
use only printer fonts. Using printer fonts will ensure that the screen
view and printed output are as close as can be to an exact match. If you
use TrueType fonts the screen view and printed output will also match.
Forms that have been saved as reports may need to be modified to ensure
that you get the correct output. By default, new reports use printer fonts
but forms do not. You can control which fonts are used by setting the
LayoutForPrint property in the form or report property sheet.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you choose a font for a form or report, the characters on the screen
may not look exactly like those that appear on the printed page because
printer fonts and screen fonts can differ. If you select a scaleable font,
such as a TrueType font, the screen and printer characters will be the
same.
<P>
When you design a form or report, you can set the LayoutForPrint property
to Yes in the form or report property sheet, and you will only see printer
fonts listed in the toolbar. The LayoutForPrint property determines whether
a screen font or printer font is used. If LayoutForPrint is set to No, the
fonts available on the toolbar include screen fonts.
<P>
If LayoutForPrint is set to Yes, the fonts and point sizes on the toolbar
correspond to the fonts and sizes available on the printer you chose in the
Print Setup command from the File menu.
<P>
For reports, this property is set to Yes by default. This property must be
changed to Yes for forms.
<P>
In Microsoft Access, you can design a form and save it as a report. If
LayoutForPrint is set to No when the form is originally designed, you may
need to change the fonts from a screen font to a TrueType or printer font
in the report design mode.
<P>
To convert a form to a report, using the right mouse button, click the form
you want to save as a report and the click the "Save As Report" option on
the menu that appears. (In versions 1.x and 2.0, open the form in Design
view and click Save As Report on the File menu.)

forms as reports," or ask the Microsoft Access 97 Office Assistant.
