The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for Microsoft Access 97 on a computer that
also has Microsoft Access 2.0 or 7.0 and Microsoft Graph 5.0 installed, and
you include the Microsoft Graph 8.0 components in the Setup options, the
following behavior occurs after Setup is finished:

<UL><LI>Any newly created or existing Microsoft Graph 5.0 objects that you edit
   are upgraded to the newer version of the Microsoft Graph object.

<LI>If you run a custom application that contains an updated Graph file
   on a computer that does not have Graph version 8.0, you receive the
   following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Can't open OLE object
</PRE><P>
</UL>If you installed the stand-alone version of Microsoft Access 97 and if you
create run-time applications using the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit
versions 2.0 or 7.0, the following behavior occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   The Setup wizard fails with the following error message:

      Setup Wizard error - cannot find Graph5

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The shared Microsoft Graph 5.0 components have been overwritten with the
Microsoft Graph 8.0 components during the Setup process.
<P>
NOTE: If you are using the stand-alone version of Microsoft Access 97, the
graph files that are located in the ADT folder are also overwritten.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
For newly created or existing Microsoft Graph objects in Microsoft Access
2.0 and 7.0, you will have the functionality of Microsoft Graph 8.0 on
computers on which you install Microsoft Access 97.
<P>
For run-time applications that you create using the Setup Wizard for the
Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit 2.0 or 7.0, before you create disk
images that include the Microsoft Graph 5.0 run-time components, you must
rerun Setup for Microsoft Access 2.0 or 7.0 to reinstall the Microsoft
Graph 5.0 components. Then you will be able to run the Setup Wizard and
include the Microsoft Graph 5.0 run-time components in your custom
applications.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot have the functionality of both Microsoft Graph 5.0 and
Microsoft Graph 8.0 on the same computer. Therefore, if you want to
continue to create applications for Microsoft Access 2.0 or 7.0 that
include graphs created using Microsoft Graph 5.0, you must create those
applications on a computer that includes the Microsoft Graph 5.0
functionality. Any computer that has been upgraded to Microsoft Graph 8.0
will create Microsoft Graph 8.0 objects.
<P>
To include the Microsoft Graph 5.0 functionality in run-time applications
created for Microsoft Access versions 2.0 and 7.0, you must run the Setup
Wizard on a computer that has Microsoft Graph 5.0 installed. The Setup
Wizard looks for the Microsoft Graph 5.0 components when it creates the
disk images. If it does not find them, it will end in an error.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Run the Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97, Professional
   Edition Setup program to install Microsoft Access 97 and Microsoft
   Graph.

<P><LI>Open a Microsoft Access version 2.0 or 7.0 application that includes a
   Microsoft Graph 5.0 object.

<P><LI>Open the Microsoft Graph 5.0 object to edit it. Note that the Microsoft
   Graph 5.0 object has been upgraded to a Microsoft Graph 8.0 object.

<P><LI>Create disk images for the application using the Microsoft Access
   Developer's Toolkit for version 2.0 or 7.0. Make sure you include the
   Microsoft Graph run-time component.

<P><LI>Note that if you installed the stand-alone version of Microsoft
   Access 97, you will receive the Setup Wizard error "Setup Wizard
   error - cannot find Graph5" while the disk images are being created.
<P>
   If you installed Microsoft Access 97 from the Office 97 Professional
   Edition package, you will be able to create the disk images. However,
   you will receive the "Can't open OLE object" error when you  try to
   open your custom application after installing it on a computer that
   does not have Microsoft Graph 8.0.
