 1. Q. What is DAO?

    A. Data access objects (DAO) and collections provide a framework
       for using code to create and manipulate components of your
       database system. Objects and collections have properties that
       describe the characteristics of database components and
       methods. DAO provides the functionality of the dynasets,
       Snapshots, and QueryDef objects you used in version 1.x, while
       giving you more structure and features. All collections use the
       same syntax.

       For more information about DAO, please refer to the following:

        - Search for "data access objects" then "Data Access Objects
          and Collections" using the Microsoft Access Help menu.

        - Search for "converting databases to version 2.0" then
          "Converting Macros and Code from Version 1.x to 2.0" using
          the Microsoft Access Help menu.

        - See Microsoft Access "Building Applications," Chapter 7,
          "Objects and Collections."

        - See Microsoft Access "Building Applications," Chapter 11,
          "Working with Sets of Records."

 2. Q. How can I use data access objects (DAO)?

    A. You can use DAO methods to create or modify different parts of
       your database, including TableDef objects, security,
       relationships, and so on. Three common tasks that you can
       accomplish with DAO are:

        - Indexing an existing field in a table.

        - Assigning permissions to a user.

        - Adding a user to a group.

       For additional information about indexing an existing field in
       a table, you can order item number <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q112107.htm">Q112107</A></B> by selecting the
       FastTips Technical Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.

       For additional information about assigning permissions to a
       user, you can order item number <B><A HREF="../vbapps/Q112106.htm">Q112106</A></B> by selecting the
       FastTips Technical Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.

       For additional information about adding a user to a group, you
       can order item number <B><A HREF="../vbapps/Q112063.htm">Q112063</A></B> by selecting the FastTips
       Technical Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.

 3. Q. How do I create an SQL pass-through query using Access
       Basic?

    A. Use the CreateQueryDef method to create an SQL pass-through
       query using Access Basic. Set the properties of your QueryDef
       as follows:

        - ConnectString: This sets the ODBC connection string, and
          must be at least "ODBC;". If the connection string does not
          include at least "ODBC;" the query is not an SQL pass-through
          query and you will receive a syntax error message. If you do
          not include the data source name, you will be prompted for
          it when you run the query. For more information about
          connection strings, search for "ODBC connection string" then
          "ODBCConnectString Property" using the Microsoft Access Help
          menu.

        - SQL statement: This is the SQL statement that is passed to
          the server. For additional information about the syntax of
          the SQL statement, please refer to your server's
          documentation.

       For additional information and an example of an SQL pass-
       through query, you can order item number <B><A HREF="../vbapps/Q112108.htm">Q112108</A></B> by selecting
       the FastTips Technical Library option from the FastTips Main
       Menu.

 4. Q. How do I determine if the record being edited is a new
       record?

    A. In Microsoft Access version 1.x, the counter field is null
       until the record is saved. So, to check for a new record, you
       would check to see if the counter field is null. In Microsoft
       Access version 2.0, the counter field is updated as soon as you
       begin inserting a new record. However, the OldValue property
       for the counter will still be null. You can use the following
       expression to determine whether the record being edited is a
       new record:

          IsNull([&lt;counterfieldname&gt;].OldValue)

       For additional information about checking for new records in
       Microsoft Access 2.0, you can order item number <B><A HREF="../vbapps/Q112109.htm">Q112109</A></B> by
       selecting the FastTips Technical Library option from the
       FastTips Main Menu.

 5. Q. Why doesn't my version 1.x Access Basic code work
       correctly in Microsoft Access 2.0?

    A. Microsoft Access 2.0 introduces many changes and new features
       to Access Basic. When you convert your database from version
       1.x to 2.0, your Access Basic code is not automatically
       converted. Because of the changes and new features, you must
       modify your code for it to work correctly in version 2.0. Some
       of the changed items include the SendKeys and DoMenuItem
       actions, and field name references. For more details about
       these changes, order the fax or mail copy of this script.

        - The SendKeys action: Some menus in Microsoft Access 2.0 have
          changed. One of the common uses for the SendKeys action,
          hiding and showing the toolbar, has been replaced with the
          new ShowToolbar action. To access the options in the Options
          dialog box (such as Show Status Bar),  use the new SetOption
          and GetOption methods with the Application object. For more
          information about the SetOption method, search for
          "SetOption" then "GetOption, SetOption Methods" using the
          Microsoft Access Help menu.

        - The DoMenuItem action: Because some menus have changed,
          there is now a fifth argument, &lt;Version&gt;, that you must
          supply when you use the DoMenuItem action in Access Basic.
          For more information about the DoMenuItem action, search for
          "DoMenuItem" then "DoMenuItem Action" using the Microsoft
          Access Help menu. You can also order item number <B><A HREF="../vbapps/Q112065.htm">Q112065</A></B>
          by selecting the FastTips Technical Library option from the
          FastTips Main Menu.

        - Using a period to reference field names: In Microsoft Access
          1.x, you can reference fields using a period before the
          field name. For example, you can use "MyTable.Name" to refer
          to the Name field in the MyTable table. If you use the same
          expression in Microsoft Access 2.0, you reference the Name
          property instead of the field called Name. Use
          "MyTable!Name" to refer to the Name field in Microsoft
          Access 2.0.

       For more information about other changes and new features in
       Access Basic, search for "converting databases to version 2.0"
       then "Converting Macros and Code from Version 1.x to 2.0" using
       the Microsoft Access Help menu.

 6. Q. Why doesn't a new table created using data access objects
       (DAO) show in the Database window?

    A. Database changes made using DAO are not automatically
       synchronized with the Database window in order to avoid
       affecting system performance. To view changes made using DAO,
       refresh the Database window by choosing a different object
       button, and then choose the object button for the object type
       you were working with. You can automate this refresh method in
       your code by using two SelectObject actions.

       When you make a change without using DAO, it is not reflected
       in the corresponding DAO object unless you call the Refresh
       method on the collection containing that object. For example,
       if you delete a table in the Database window, use the following
       expression to remove the table from the TableDefs collection:

          &lt;MyDatabase&gt;.TableDefs.Refresh

 7. Q. How do I include a variable in the WHERE clause of my SQL
       statement?

    A. The syntax for including a variable in the WHERE clause of an
       SQL statement depends on the variable's data type. Numeric
       variables do not require delimiters, string variables should be
       enclosed in single quotation marks, and date variables should
       be enclosed in number signs (#). Concatenate the variable and
       the appropriate delimiter, if required, as shown in the three
       examples available in the fax or mail copy of this script.

       For a numeric variable, use the following syntax:

          &lt;myq&gt;.sql = "select * from &lt;table&gt; where
          [&lt;field&gt;]=" &amp; &lt;mynum&gt; &amp; ";"

       For a string variable, use the following syntax:

          &lt;myq&gt;.sql = "select * from &lt;table&gt; where
          [&lt;field&gt;]='" &amp; &lt;mytext&gt; &amp; "';"

       For a date variable, use the following syntax:

          &lt;myq&gt;.sql = "select * from &lt;table&gt; where
          [&lt;field&gt;]=#" &amp; &lt;mydate&gt; &amp; "#;"

       For additional information about concatenating variables, you
       can order item number <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q96576.htm">Q96576</A></B> by selecting the FastTips
       Technical Library option from the FastTips Main Menu.

 8. Q. Will the macros I created in Microsoft Access version 1.x
       work in version 2.0?

    A. Macro syntax has not changed from version 1.x to 2.0, so macros
       created in version 1.x should work correctly. However, if your
       macros use the SendKeys action, you may need to make some
       changes to reflect the menu changes and new features in
       Microsoft Access 2.0.

 9. Q. Can I call a function stored in my form module from a
       regular module?

    A. Functions stored in form or report modules are private to that
       module's form or report, and can only be called from that
       module's form or report. If you want to use the function in a
       different form, report, or global function, make it a global
       function by storing it in a regular module.

       For more information about writing and using event procedures,
       see Microsoft Access "Building Applications," Chapter 3,
       "Introducing Access Basic," and Chapter 5, "Access Basic
       Fundamentals."

10. Q. How do I edit a library? Do I have to unload the library
       first as in Microsoft Access version 1.x?

    A. Debugging libraries in Microsoft Access version 1.x requires
       you to unload the library and restart Microsoft Access each
       time you find an error in the library. In Microsoft Access 2.0,
       you can debug libraries without unloading the library and
       restarting Microsoft Access.

       To debug or edit a library in Microsoft Access 2.0, add the
       following line to the [Options] section of the MSACC20.INI
       file:

          DebugLibraries=True

       Once you have added this line to the MSACC20.INI file and
       restarted Microsoft Access, you can edit the functions in your
       library. If this line is not in your MSACC20.INI file, or is
       set to False, you will not be able to edit your library.
