The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you use Microsoft Access 97 to convert or open a database created
With an earlier version of Microsoft Access, you may receive some or all
of the following error messages.
<P>
<P><h3>Converting a Database</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>    Microsoft Access can't open the form &lt;form name&gt;.

    It contains data that Microsoft Access doesn't recognize.
    Re-create the form or, if you maintain backup copies of your
    database, retrieve a copy of the form.

    followed by the message:

    There were compilation errors during the conversion or enabling of
    this database.

    The database has not been saved in a compiled state. The performance
    of the database will be impaired because Microsoft Access will need
    to recompile the database for each session. For information on
    improving performance, click Help.

    followed by the message:

    The Save operation failed.

    followed by the message:

    Device I/O error

</PRE><h3>Opening (Enabling) a Database</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>    The form or report &lt;object name&gt; has too many controls.

    Reduce the number of controls on the form or report before
    using it in this version of Microsoft Access.

    followed by the message:

    Invalid operation.

    followed by the message:

    There were compilation errors during the conversion or enabling of
    this database.

    The database has not been saved in a compiled state. The performance
    of the database will be impaired because Microsoft Access will need
    to recompile the database for each session. For information on
    improving performance, click Help.

    followed by the message:

    Unexpected error (32811)

    followed by the message:

    The Save operation failed.

    followed by the message:

    Unexpected error (32811)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is at least one form or report in your database that contains a
Visual Basic for Applications module and 754 or more combined controls,
sections, and fields in the RecordSource property.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the version of Microsoft Access with which you originally created the
database to modify the design of the form or report. Decrease the total
number of sections, controls, and fields in the RecordSource property to
fewer than 754.
<P>
If the record source for the form or report contains a large number of
fields that you do not need to display, consider creating a query that
only selects the fields you need to display, and set it as the
RecordSource property for the object.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access 97 limits the total number of controls plus sections plus
fields in the RecordSource property to 754. For example, if a form
contains a Detail section, 500 unbound text boxes, a Visual Basic for
Applications module, and a record source that contains 255 fields, you
receive the errors listed in the "Symptoms" section when you convert or
open the database in Microsoft Access 97. This occurs even though none of
the fields in the RecordSource property are actually used on the form.
<P>
<PRE>                  Number of Controls: 500
                  Number of Sections:   1
    Number of Fields in RecordSource: 255
                                      ---
                                      756

</PRE>If a form or report does not contain a Visual Basic for Applications
module but does exceed the 754 control limit, the conversion may succeed,
but you may receive other errors when you try to design or use the form in
Microsoft Access 97.
<P>
For more information about errors you may receive when exceeding the 754
control limit, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
