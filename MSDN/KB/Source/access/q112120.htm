The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you convert your Microsoft Access version 1.x databases to version 2.0
format, you may have to make some modifications to make sure your databases
will perform correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are some differences in the formats of Microsoft Access version 1.x
and version 2.0 databases. These differences may cause unexpected results
when you are using converted databases. Details of the database format
changes from version 1.x to 2.0 are listed in Appendix C of the Microsoft
Access 2.0 "Building Applications" manual.
<P>
The Convert Database command on the File menu, available only when you do
not have a database open, can be used to convert databases from version 1.x
format to version 2.0 format. When you convert a database from version 1.x
to version 2.0 format, all database objects are converted. The following
sections describe how the various database objects are converted:
<P>
<P><h3>Tables</h3>
 
<P>
Tables are automatically converted to version 2.0 database format. Tables
that were attached in version 1.x can still be used, but you should refresh
all attachments to take advantage of Microsoft Access 2.0's ability to send
conversion functions (such as CLng(), CStr(), and so on) to the server
rather than processing them locally.
<P>
Use the Attachment Manager Add-in in Microsoft Access 2.0 to refresh all
the attachments, rather than deleting and re-attaching each attachment as
in Microsoft Access 1.x. If an attachment is deleted, all the properties
set in the current database for that attachment are lost. To use the
Attachment Manager Add-in, choose Add-ins from the File menu, then choose
Attachment Manager.
<P>
<P><h3>Queries</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access automatically compiles queries before running them. The
first time you run a query in version 2.0, the compiled format of the query
will be discarded and it will be recompiled. Then, the new compiled format
will automatically be saved.
<P>
<P><h3>Forms and Reports</h3>
 
<P>
Forms and reports are converted temporarily into memory as they are opened.
As a result, you can gain a small performance increase if you open and then
resave all of your pre-existing forms and reports in Microsoft Access
version 2.0, so that Microsoft Access does not have to convert them as you
use them.
<P>
<P><h3>Macros</h3>
 
<P>
Macros are not converted. The format for macros is not changed in
Microsoft Access version 2.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Modules</h3>
 
<P>
The internal format of modules is changed in Microsoft Access version 2.0.
Version 2.0 automatically converts modules when they are loaded into
memory. However, the converted code is not saved until you save the module.
For that reason, you are prompted to save a converted module the first time
you close it whether you make changes to it or not. If the converted module
is not saved, the conversions are lost. This prompt occurs every time an
unconverted module is closed until you save it.
<P>
<P><h3>Default Values and Validation Rules</h3>
 
<P>
Some default value expressions and validation rules, valid in version
1.x databases, may not be valid in version 2.0 databases.
<P>
In Microsoft Access version 2.0, validation rules are evaluated starting at
the table level. Validation rules in forms or elsewhere are evaluated in
addition to table-level validation. At the table level, version 2.0 does
not allow the following in validation rules:

<UL><LI>User-defined functions
<LI>Microsoft Access domain functions, such as DCount()
<LI>Total (aggregate) functions, such as Sum()
<LI>References to other fields for field validation (for record
   validation, references to other fields in the table are allowed)
<LI>CurrentUser() or Eval() functions
<P>
</UL>During the conversion process, a table named ConvertErrors will be
created and filled with descriptions of any default value expressions
or validation rules that were not converted. It may be necessary to
check all data objects for "#Name?" errors.
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to Reserved Words and Function Names</h3>
 
<P>
There are many new reserved words and function names. "Reserved" means that
the word or function name has special significance to Microsoft Access
version 2.0 and cannot be used as a user-specified control name, function
name, and so on. The Microsoft Access Help system and Appendix C of the
Microsoft Access 2.0 "Building Applications" manual lists new reserved
words. General rules include:

<UL><LI>Form controls cannot have the name "form." Also, a report control
   cannot have the name "report."

<LI>Controls in a form or report cannot have the same name as a
   section.

<LI>Object names that conflict with reserved words can be qualified by
   enclosing the object name with square brackets, such as:
   "[Move].visible" instead of "Move.visible".
<P>
</UL><h3>SendKeys Action or Statement</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the SendKeys statement or action to fill in dialog boxes or
choose commands from menus, the changes in some version 2.0 dialog boxes
and menus may require you to recode the statement. Because changes are
likely to occur with each version of Microsoft Access, it is a good idea to
try to avoid using SendKeys when possible. See Appendix C of the "Building
Applications" manual for tips on avoiding the use of SendKeys.
<P>
<P><h3>Security</h3>
 
<P>
If a version 1.x database is secured, it will remain secure whether it is
opened using version 1.x or version 2.0. However, Microsoft Access 2.0
cannot be used to change or add permissions in the database, even by the
administrator, until the database is converted to version 2.0.
<P>
When you install Microsoft Access 2.0 it creates its own workgroup
file (SYSTEM.MDA). If Microsoft Access version 2.0 is installed in the
same directory as version 1.x, the version 1.x SYSTEM.MDA file will be
renamed SYSTEM1X.MDA.
<P>
To make changes to the security of a converted database, you must use a
version 2.0 SYSTEM.MDA that has identical groups and users (and identical
PIDs) as the original SYSTEM.MDA.
<P>
NOTE: PIDs (Personal IDs) in Microsoft Access version 2.0 are the
equivalent of PINs (Personal ID Numbers) in version 1.x.
<P>
How to Create a Secure Workgroup:

<OL><P><LI>Use the Workgroup Administrator tool to create a new workgroup.
   This is a version 2.0 SYSTEM.MDA file.

<P><LI>Re-create all the users and groups using the same names and PIDs
   that were used in Microsoft Access version 1.x.
<P>
</OL>How to Convert a Secure 1.x Database to 2.0 Format:
<P>
NOTE: In a secure workgroup, only users with Modify Design permissions to
all of the objects can convert a version 1.x format to version 2.0 format.
Also, you must assign Modify Design permissions to the version 1.x database
in Microsoft Access version 1.x using the version 1.x workgroup.

<OL><P><LI>Make sure that no one is using the version 1.x database.

<P><LI>Log on to Microsoft Access 2.0 as a member of the Admins group who is
   not the Admin user.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose the Convert Database command.

<P><LI>Select the version 1.x database you want to convert. You will be
   prompted for the version 2.0 database name.
<P>
   NOTE: The Convert Database command will force you to choose a new name
   for the database. This lets you keep a backup copy of your version 1.x
   database, as once you have converted a database from version 1.x to
   version 2.0 you CANNOT convert it back to version 1.x.

<P><LI>Have your users join the new version 2.0 workgroup (SYSTEM.MDA) by
   using the Workgroup Administrator tool.
<P>
   NOTE: You can also accomplish this by modifying the MSACC20.INI file
   in your Windows directory. In the [Options] section of the file,
   change the SystemDB entry to point to the version 2.0 SYSTEM.MDA
   file. The [Options] section of the file will be similar to the example
   below:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Options]
      SystemDB=&lt;microsoft access path&gt;\SYSTEM.MDA
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Verifying Conversion</h3>
 
<P>
To determine if a database was converted from Microsoft Access version 1.x
to version 2.0 with the Convert Database command correctly, check the
V1xNullBehavior property. This property is not available if the database
was converted by Access Basic code. It is available only if the database
was converted using the Convert Database command on the File menu.
<P>
The sample function below uses the V1xNullBehavior property to determine if
a database was converted from Microsoft Access version 1.x to version 2.0
with the Convert Database command. The flag variable IsConverted holds the
function's result. If IsConverted is True (-1,) then the database was
converted with the Convert Database command.
<P>
<PRE>   Function IsConverted (checkdb As String)
      On Error GoTo NotFound
      Dim MyDatabase As Database, V1xNull As Integer
      Set MyDatabase = DBEngine.Workspaces(0).OpenDatabase(checkdb)

      V1xNull = MyDatabase.properties.V1xNullBehavior
      IsConverted = True
      MyDatabase.Close
      Exit Function

   NotFound:
      If Err = 3024 Then
         MsgBox "Could not find database."
      Else
         IsConverted = False
         MyDatabase.Close
      End If
      Exit Function
   End Function

</PRE></OL>To use this function, type the following in a module's Immediate window,
and then press ENTER:
<P>
<PRE>   ? IsConverted("&lt;yourdatabasename&gt;.MDB")

</PRE>Note that a native version 2.0 database will return a 0 when used with this
function.
<P>
To check which version of Microsoft Access a SYSTEM.MDA file was created
with, use the following sample Access Basic function:
<P>
<PRE>   Function CheckSysDbVer (sysdbname As String) As String
      Dim d As Database
      Set d = DBEngine(0).OpenDatabase(sysdbname)
      CheckSysDbVer = d.version
      d.Close
   End Function

</PRE>To use this function, type the following in a module's Immediate window and
then press ENTER:
<P>
<PRE>   ? CheckSysDbVer("&lt;microsoft access path&gt;\SYSTEM.MDA")

</PRE><h3>Conversion Errors</h3>
 
<P>
If the process of converting a 1.x database to version 2.0 results in any
unexpected errors or problems, such as a general protection (GP) fault or
Microsoft Access closing itself, try running the Repair command (from the
File menu) in Microsoft Access version 1.x on the version 1.x database.
Then, try to convert the database again. Some version 1.x databases may
have slight errors that go undetected until you try to convert the database
in version 2.0, because version 2.0 is better at detecting database
problems.
