The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you try to encrypt a database, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   You can't encrypt a database that you didn't create or don't own. See
   the owner of the database or your workgroup administrator.

</PRE>This message is incomplete. It should also include being a member of the
Admins group of the system database that was in use when the database was
created as a requirement for encrypting the database.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The requirements for encrypting a database are as follows:
<P>
Microsoft Access requires that one of the following be true for the person
trying to encrypt a database:
<P>
- The person is the owner of the database.
- The person is the creator of the database.
- The person is a member of the Admins group in the workgroup (the default
<PRE>  name is system.mdw) that was in use when the database was created.

</PRE>NOTE: Encrypting a database compacts the database file and makes it
unreadable by a utility program or word processor. It is used to prevent
someone using a file or disk editor from reading or writing data directly
to an .MDB file, bypassing the Microsoft Jet database engine.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
