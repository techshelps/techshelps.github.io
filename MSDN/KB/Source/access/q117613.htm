The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
<LI>Microsoft Graph version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
Each time a Microsoft Graph 5.0 object is refreshed, the legend moves
to a new location.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Although you cannot prevent the legend from moving when the graph is
refreshed, you can use OLE Automation to reset the legend's position. See
the "Workaround" section later in this article for an example of this
technique.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Graph version
5.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A graph in a Microsoft Access form or report is refreshed when any of the
following occurs:

<UL><LI>If the graph is linked to the data in the form or report, the graph is
   refreshed each time a new record is displayed.

<LI>When you press F9.

<LI>When the form containing the graph is refreshed by Access Basic code or
   the Refresh macro action.
<P>
</UL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database NWIND.MDB.

<P><LI>Open the form Sales By Product in Design view.

<P><LI>Double-click the graph object to open it in Microsoft Graph 5.0.

<P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Legend.

<P><LI>With the legend selected, choose Selected Legend from the Format menu.
   Click the Placement tab, then choose the Bottom option button. Choose
   OK.

<P><LI>Quit Graph to return to Microsoft Access.

<P><LI>View the form in Form view.

<P><LI>Click a record selector button at the bottom of the form to move to
   another record. Note that the legend moves up the graph when the graph
   is refreshed. As you move through the records, the legend moves further
   up the graph.
<P>
</OL><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
This example continues the example started in the "Steps to Reproduce
Problem" section of this article. After completing the steps in that
section, follow these steps to use OLE Automation to reset the legend to
the bottom of the graph each time the graph is refreshed:

<OL><P><LI>View the form in Design view.

<P><LI>Select the graph object and display the property sheet. Select the
   OnUpdated property and then click the Build button to the right of the
   property. Select Code Builder and then choose OK.

<P><LI>To specify the top and left positions, enter the following lines in
   the module:
<P>
<P><PRE>       Me!Embedded13.Object.Legend.Top = 171
       Me!Embedded13.Object.Legend.Left = 100
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    NOTE: The value 171 was obtained by opening the Sales By Product form
    in Design view, opening the form module, and then entering the
    following line in the Immediate window:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       ?Forms![Sales By Product]!Embedded13.Object.Legend.Top
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Run menu, choose Compile Loaded Modules, then close the
<P><PRE>    module.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save and then close the form.

<P><LI>Open the form in Form view and move through the records. Note that the
   legend remains at the bottom of the graph.
<P>
</OL>To use this workaround in a report, specify the code in step 11 in the
OnFormat property setting of the report section that contains the graph.
