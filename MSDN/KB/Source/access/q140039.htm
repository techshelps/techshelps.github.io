<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
This article contains a letter which Microsoft sent to Microsoft Access for
Windows 95 beta test sites in early November 1995. The letter explains a
few rare problems that may occur as a result of residual files from beta
installations and describes possible solutions to these problems.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>            Microsoft Access for Windows 95 Beta Site Cleanup

</PRE>Thank you for helping make Microsoft Access for Windows 95 the best
database for all Windows 95 users. To ensure that you do not encounter any
problems with the retail version of Microsoft Access, you need to take
steps to convert your databases developed in beta versions to the retail
version of Microsoft Access. If you encounter problems with the retail
version of Microsoft Access, you may want to purge your beta test computer
of all previous beta installations.
<P>
<P><h3>Transferring Databases to Final Code</h3>
 
<P>
If you have been using a pre-release version of Microsoft Access, there are
a few actions you may need to take when you open a database in the release
version of Microsoft Access. Which steps you need to perform depends on
which pre-release version of Microsoft Access you have been running. Once
you've completed the steps outlined below, you should remove all pre-
release versions of Microsoft Access from your computer and avoid using
them again.
<P>
<P><h3>Import all Objects into a New Database</h3>
 
<P>
If you have been running a post-TR3 beta, then you should import all
objects from the existing database into a new database in the release
version of Microsoft Access. You must have administrator privileges on this
new database. You will gain significant performance improvements if you
import objects into a new database in this way. The importing process
results in a larger database, so you may want to compact the new database,
and then do a Compile All Modules, Save All Modules on the compacted
database.
<P>
<P><h3>Saving Modules as Text</h3>
 
<P>
If you have been running TR3 or earlier, then you must save all modules as
Text using the Save Modules as Text add-in before installing the release
version of Microsoft Access for all databases. Assuming you have installed
all add-ins with TR3, this command will be available under Add-ins on the
Tools menu. Next, install the release version of Microsoft Access. When you
open a database, all Visual Basic for Applications code in that database
will be converted to the release version.
<P>
<P><h3>AutoNumber Fields and Foreign Key Default Values</h3>
 
<P>
Due to a binary format change from the early beta releases, some AutoNumber
fields in your tables may have their NewValues property reset from
Increment to Random. Also, related tables with foreign keys based on these
AutoNumber fields will have their default value changed to the
GenUniqueID() function.
<P>
The affected tables will still show the AutoNumber field's NewValues
property as Increment. If you are having problems opening forms and
reports, this may be the problem. If any foreign keys to tables with
AutoNumber (Increment) fields have their DefaultValue property reset to
GenUniqueID, you have this problem. To correct this problem, do the
following:

<UL><LI>Delete the relationships between the affected tables and the other
   tables.

<LI>Delete the affected AutoNumber field.

<LI>Copy the entire table to a new table and delete all records from this
   table.

<LI>Add the AutoNumber field back to the new table (use the same field
   name).

<LI>Create an append query to append the old table records to the new table.
   Run the query.

<LI>Delete the old table and rename the new table to the old table name.

<LI>Reset the default values in all tables with foreign keys to the
   AutoNumber field.

<LI>Re-establish the relationships.
<P>
</UL><h3>Text Box Properties</h3>
 
<P>
Due to an underlying change in the text box properties, two text box
properties will shift when you convert your database from TR3a or earlier
betas to final Microsoft Access. Because we moved the properties, any text
boxes you have created in TR3a or earlier betas will have the ToolTipsText
and ShortcutMenu properties shifted to the wrong location.

<OL><P><LI>Your ToolTipsText will be in the ShortcutMenu property.
</OL>2. Your ShortcutMenu will be gone (moved to Japanese-only location).
<P>
This change only affects text boxes. Command buttons and all other controls
will not change. To fix this problem, you must save the ShortcutMenu text
before converting your database to the final version of Microsoft Access.
ToolTipsText will be there; it will just be in the wrong location.
<P>
<P><h3>Purging Old Beta Installs</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to be sure you have no residual files from the beta process on
your computer, the only recourse is to reformat your hard drive and to
reinstall your applications and documents. Unfortunately, due to the
complexity of this beta cycle, the only way to ensure that you have removed
all old files and registry entries from the Windows 95, Microsoft Access
95, Microsoft Office 95, the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit for
Windows 95, and Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 betas is to reformat. Many
people have seen improved performance and stability after this process.
<P>
We understand how painful this process is, but it is the only sure way to
have a clean install. After several failed cleanup efforts, we have
reformatted our own beta test computers to purge the old beta files and
registry entries.
<P>
Before reformatting your hard drive be sure to:

<OL><P><LI>Make backups of all documents you want to keep.

<P><LI>Have on hand all application installation disks.

<P><LI>Have on hand all old application disks required to install upgrades.
<P>
</OL>Again, thank you for the great beta testing.
