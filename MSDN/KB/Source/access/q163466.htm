The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
The "Publish to the Web" Wizard does not allow you to type in a unique name
for a file. It appends "_1" (without the quotation marks) to the end of
each file that it publishes. For example, the table "Categories" is saved
as "Categories_1.html" when you publish it to HTML format using the
"Publish to the Web" Wizard.
<P>
If you use the "Publish to the Web" Wizard to export two objects that have
the same name, an "_2" (without the quotation marks) is appended to the end
of the second file name. For example, if you click Save As HTML for the
Categories table and the Categories form at the same time, two files are
created, Categories_1.html and Categories_2.html.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The "Publish to the Web" Wizard allows you to export multiple objects;
therefore, it cannot allow you to specify custom file names.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To assign a custom file name to your Web file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the object you want to publish in the Database window.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click, Save As/Export.

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, click "To an External File or Database."
   Click OK.

<P><LI>In the Save In dialog box, select the folder where you want to save your
   file.

<P><LI>In the Save As Type box, select a Web format for your file.

<P><LI>In the File Name box, type the name you want to give to your Web file.
   Click Export to create the file.
<P>
</OL>This provides you with a custom-named file in the Web format of your
choice.
<P>
NOTE: You cannot simply rename your files after you export them because
scripts in IDC and ASP files still refer to the original name. In addition,
if links in other HTML files (such as a default home page) refer to the
original name, those links will be broken if you rename the original file.
<P>
Note also that the "Publish to the Web" Wizard overwrites existing files
without warning; the Save As/Export command on the File menu prompts you
before overwriting existing files.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As HTML.

<P><LI>Click Next on the opening screen of the "Publish to the Web" Wizard.

<P><LI>On the "What do you want to publish?" screen, select all of the
   Northwind tables. Click Finish.

<P><LI>When the wizard finishes creating the files, use Windows Explorer or
   File Manager to locate the folder where you saved the HTML files. Note
   that the files have the same names as the objects you selected to
   publish, with "_1" appended to the end.
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>

Help Index for "Publish to the Web Wizard" or ask the Microsoft Access 97
Office Assistant.
