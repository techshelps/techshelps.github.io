The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
<LI>Microsoft Office Developer Edition 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you use the /runtime switch to start Microsoft Access 97 on a computer
that does not have the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE) or
a custom application created by using the ODE installed, you may receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't find the dynamic-link library (DLL) Mso97rt.

   You can't use the /runtime command-line switch unless you have installed
   Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The file, MSO97rt.dll, needed to simulate the Microsoft Access run-time
environment, is only installed on your computer when you run Setup of the
ODE or a custom application that was created with the ODE.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To use the /runtime switch with the retail version of Microsoft Access 97,
you must install the ODE or a custom application created with the ODE on
your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In versions of Microsoft Access earlier than Microsoft Access 97, it was
possible to use the /runtime switch with the retail version. However, to
simulate the Microsoft Access run-time environment in Microsoft Access 97,
you must have an application that contains the MSo97rt.dll file installed
on your computer.
<P>
The following information is contained in the Microsoft Access 97 Help
topic, "Simulating the Microsoft Access Run-Time Environment":
<P>
<PRE>   If you have the Microsoft Office 97, Developer Edition Tools installed,
   you can test and debug your application in Microsoft Access by using the
   Microsoft Access /runtime startup command-line option to turn off full
   Microsoft Access features and simulate the environment in which users
   will run your application.

</PRE>It also includes the following tip:
<P>
<PRE>   Tip  If Microsoft Access is installed on a user's machine, you can test
   your run-time application by copying the file Mso97rt.dll to the user's
   c:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\VBA folder.

   Also, for this method to work, your application must have a startup
   form that provides access to all the objects you want available (a
   main switchboard form), because you can't display the Database window
   in run-time mode.

</PRE><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps assume that the Mso97rt.dll file has not been installed
on your computer by a custom application or the ODE.

<OL><P><LI>Create a shortcut to start Microsoft Access.

<P><LI>Using the right mouse button (right-click), click the shortcut, click
   Properties, and then click the Shortcut tab.

<P><LI>In the Target box, following the path to MSAccess.exe, type the path to
   the database you want to open, and then type "/runtime" (without the
   quotation marks). If the path contains spaces, enclose it in quotation
   marks.
<P>
   For example, the following command line starts Microsoft Access and then
   opens the Northwind sample application in run-time mode:
<P>
<P><PRE>      "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\MSAccess.exe" "C:\Program
       Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples\Northwind.mdb" /runtime
</PRE>
<P><LI>Double-click the shortcut to start the application in run-time mode.
   Note that you receive the error message mentioned in the "Symptoms"
   section.
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>

for "run-time environment, simulating," or ask the Microsoft Access 97
Office Assistant.
