The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you run a macro that executes an OpenReport action, and then executes
a SetValue action that sets the value for controls on the report being
opened, the controls on the first page of the report are not updated by
the SetValue action.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The SetValue action was executed after the report was opened. After the
report is opened, it is too late to change the values for controls that
appear on the first page. The SetValue action should be placed in a macro
that is triggered from the Format event of the control's report section
or the Activate event of the report.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Create a macro that contains the SetValue action and attach that macro to
the Activate event of the report or the Format event of the control's
report section. Then, the controls on the first page of the report will
display the correct values.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Activate event of the report occurs before the report's Format event.
The Format event occurs when Microsoft Access determines which data
belongs in a report section, but before the section is formatted for
previewing or printing. Changes that affect the data that will be
displayed in a report section should be placed in the Format event of
that section or the Activate event of the report.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database NorthWind.mdb.

<P><LI>Create a report using the AutoReport: Columnar Wizard based on the
   Categories table.

<P><LI>Open the report in Design view and add an unbound textbox to the detail
   section. Change the Name property of this control to "txtDate" (without
   the quotation marks).

<P><LI>In the detail section of the report, set the ForceNewPage property to
   After Section.

<P><LI>Close the report and save it as "rptSetValue" (without the quotation
   marks).

<P><LI>Create the following macro:
<P>
<PRE>      Macro Name      Action
      --------------------------
      Test1           OpenReport
                      SetValue

      Test1 Actions
      -------------------------------------------
      OpenReport
         Report Name: rptSetValue
         View:        Preview

      SetValue
         Item:        Reports!rptSetValue!txtDate
         Expression:  Date()

</PRE><P><LI>Save the macro as Test1 and run it.
<P>
   Note that the report opens but the date does not appear in the unbound
   textbox (txtDate) on the first page. On subsequent pages the date is
   displayed in the text box as expected.

Index for "order of events," and then "Find out when events occur," or ask
the Microsoft Access 97 Office Assistant.
