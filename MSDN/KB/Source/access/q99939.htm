<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article demonstrates how to use NetDDE to communicate with Microsoft
Access on a remote computer. This article assumes that you are familiar
with DDE communications on a local computer, and with the capabilities of
Microsoft Access as a DDE server.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Access Basic and with
creating Microsoft Access applications using the programming tools provided
with Microsoft Access. For more information on Access Basic, please refer
to the "Introduction to Programming" manual in Microsoft Access version
1.x, or the "Building Applications" manual, Chapter 3, "Introducing Access
Basic," in version 2.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In order to establish a link to a remote application, a DDE share must be
created on the remote computer. A DDE share is a name that represents an
application name, a topic, and any permissions for that topic. A DDE
conversation can only occur with applications and topics assigned to share
names on the remote computer. Note that a utility called Network DDE Share
Manager (provided with the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit) can be used
to create and edit DDE share names.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Create the DDE Share</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps demonstrate how to create a DDE share for the Employees
table in the sample database NWIND.MDB:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Network DDE Share Manager. On the Share menu, click New.

<P><LI>Type "Northwind Employees" (without the quotation marks) in the Share
   Name box.

<P><LI>Type "MSACCESS.EXE" (without the quotation marks) in the Application
   Name box and "NWIND.MDB;TABLE Employees" (without the quotation marks)
   in the Topic Name box. The password information is optional and can be
   left empty.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Communicate with the Remote Microsoft Access DDE Share</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Before running the following function, make sure that Microsoft
Access is running on the remote computer and that the NWIND.MDB database
is open.
<P>
Create the following procedure in a Microsoft Access module on your local
computer:
<P>
NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) is used as a
line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the end of the line
when re-creating this code in Access Basic.
<P>
<PRE>   Option Explicit
   Function GetRemoteEmployeeInfo()
      Dim iChan As Integer
      Dim EmpRecord As String, FieldNames As String

      iChan = DDEInitiate("\\RemoteMachineName\NDDE$", _
      "Northwind Employees")

      FieldNames = DDERequest(iChan, "FieldNames")
      MsgBox FieldNames, 0, "Employee Table Field Names"

      On Error Resume Next
      EmpRecord = DDERequest(iChan, "FirstRow")
      Do Until EmpRecord = ""
         MsgBox EmpRecord, 0, "Employee Record"
         EmpRecord = ""
         EmpRecord = DDERequest(iChan, "NextRow")
      Loop
   End Function

</PRE></OL>Change the first argument of the DDEInitiate command (RemoteMachineName) to
reference the name of your remote computer.
<P>
When you run this function from the Immediate window, a message box will
be displayed that shows a list of field names in the Employees table. Next,
a series of message boxes will appear displaying each record from the
table. The field data will be delimited by a tab character.
<P>
<P><h3>The DDEInitiate Statement</h3>
 
<P>
Note the arguments used in the DDEInitiate command to establish the link
with the remote share. The application name is the net DDE server
application NDDE$ located on the remote computer "\\RemoteMachineName".
NDDE$ is a system service application that is run automatically by Windows
for Workgroups in the background. This application is always running and
present when Windows for Workgroups is running and cannot be terminated.
<P>
When NDDE$ receives the topic "Northwind Employees" it checks the list of
available DDE shares on the local computer. If it finds the share, it will
validate any permissions on the share and prompt for a password if one is
required. After the validation is complete, NDDE$ establishes a local DDE
link with the application name and topic assigned to the share name.
<P>
Once the link has been established, communication with the client
application proceeds as if it were another application on the local
computer. NDDE$ becomes the liaison between the two applications across the
network.
