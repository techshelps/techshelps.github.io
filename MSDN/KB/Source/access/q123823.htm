The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computer.

<PRE> 1. Q. Why is Microsoft releasing a Service Pack for Microsoft Access
       version 2.0?

    A. We are releasing the Microsoft Access version 2.0 Service Pack for
       several reasons. The Service Pack fixes a harmless but irritating
       problem that causes an internal database flag that is used to
       determine the state of data in the database to be erroneously set,
       sometimes causing the error message "Couldn't open SYSTEM.MDA." In
       order to work around this problem, customers have to run the repair
       utility on the database, a process that can be lengthy for large
       databases. The problem does not cause damage to the database or
       data in it, but can be inconvenient. The Service Pack also includes
       updated OLE dynamic-link library (DLL) files that allow third-party
       OLE custom controls to run in Microsoft Access 2.0, updated
       Paradox, Btrieve, and xBASE ISAM drivers, and an updated Setup
       Wizard.

 2. Q. Who should install the Service Pack?

    A. All Microsoft Access version 2.0 users should install the Service
       Pack because it corrects problems and enhances certain features.
       It is particularly important to those who are:

         - Involved in multiuser database work.

         - Using OLE custom controls in their database applications.

         - Working with Btrieve, Paradox, or xBASE data.

       The Service Pack is available in all the languages that Microsoft
       Access is available in. Please contact the Microsoft sales office
       in your country for more details.

 3. Q. What is included in the Service Pack?

    A. The Service Pack includes the latest versions of:

         - The Microsoft Jet database engine (version 2.5).

         - The OLE DLLs (version 2.02).

         - The Btrieve, Paradox, and xBASE ISAM drivers.

       The Service Pack also includes an updated Setup Wizard, a brief
       Readme file, and a Setup program that installs the new files
       only if it finds Microsoft Access version 2.0 and the Microsoft Jet
       database engine version 2.0.

 4. Q. What is the Microsoft Jet database engine version 2.5?

    A. The Microsoft Jet database engine version 2.5 is an updated version
       of the database engine that ships with Microsoft Access 2.0 and
       Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0. The Microsoft Jet database
       engine has been modified to enhance database repair functionality
       and to correct the erroneous setting of an internal database flag
       that in some cases results in the error message "Couldn't open
       SYSTEM.MDA."

       Note that the Visual Basic Compatibility Layer will continue
       to work seamlessly with this new version of the Microsoft Jet
       database engine.

 5. Q. What is OLE 2.02?

    A. OLE 2.02 is a minor upgrade to the OLE libraries shipped with
       Microsoft Access 2.0. These new libraries are included primarily
       because third-party custom controls will expect to find these
       libraries installed. Developers using third-party controls or
       controls distributed by other Microsoft products should install
       these libraries.

 6. Q. How do I obtain the Service Pack?

    A. You can obtain the Service Pack from the following sources:

         - Internet
         - Microsoft Download Service (MSDL) (1-425-936-6735)
         - FastTips (1-800-936-4100)
         - GEnie
         - America Online

       International customers should contact their local subsidiary to
       obtain the Service Pack. Microsoft cannot mail the Service Pack
       disks overseas. The Service Pack will be available in all the
       languages that Microsoft Access is available in.

 7. Q. How much does the Service Pack cost?

    A. There is no charge for the Service Pack.

 8. Q. Will Microsoft include the Service Pack files in Microsoft Access
       version 2.0?

    A. There are no plans to include this software in Microsoft Access
       version 2.0.

 9. Q. My company has several workstations that need the Service Pack.
       Do I have to obtain as many copies of the Service Pack as we have
       workstations?

    A. The Service Pack license allows you to install the software on any
       workstation that has a valid license for Microsoft Access. You need
       only obtain one copy of the Service Pack to install it on these
       computers.

10. Q. What is the enhanced repair functionality in the Microsoft Jet
       database engine version 2.5?

    A. The Microsoft Jet database engine version 2.5 can repair or recover
       information in some cases where it was not possible to do so
       before. For detailed information, please see the following article
       in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

          ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q123588.htm">Q123588</A></B>
          TITLE     : ACC2: Microsoft Access Repair Utility Enhanced

11. Q. What files are affected by the Microsoft Access version 2.0
       Service Pack?

    A. The Service Pack updates the following existing files:

         - BTRV200.DLL
         - COMPOBJ.DLL
         - CTL3D.DLL
         - MSAJT200.DLL
         - MSAJU200.DLL
         - MSJETERR.DLL
         - MSJETINT.DLL
         - OLE2.DLL
         - OLE2.REG
         - OLE2CONV.DLL
         - OLE2DISP.DLL
         - OLE2NLS.DLL
         - OLE2PROX.DLL
         - PDX200.DLL
         - STDOLE.TLB
         - STORAGE.DLL
         - TYPELIB.DLL
         - XBS200.DLL

       The Service Pack adds the following new files:

           JETVER.TXT     This file contains code for version verification,
                          which ensures you run the application using the
                          correct version of the Microsoft Jet database
                          engine.

           READSRV.TXT    This file contains information on installing the
                          Service Pack.

12. Q. Is my Visual Basic installation affected by the Service Pack?

    A. No. If you are using the Visual Basic Compatibility Layer (VBCL)
       and you have updated to the Microsoft Jet database engine version
       2.0, the Microsoft Jet database engine will be upgraded for you
       automatically when you install the Service Pack. Your applications
       will run without change. If you are using Visual Basic 3.0 and have
       not installed the VBCL, nothing will be updated.

13. Q. Is this a new version of Microsoft Access? Is it 32-bit?

    A. The Service Pack is not a new version of Microsoft Access, and it
       is not 32-bit. Rather, it is a free upgrade that updates key
       components of your current Microsoft Access installation to fix
       certain problems and augment specific functionality.

14. Q. If some of my users install the Service Pack and some do not, will
       there be problems sharing the same databases or applications?

    A. No. Users with the Service Pack will be fully interoperable with
       users who have not installed the Service Pack. The problem that
       results in the error message "Couldn't open SYSTEM.MDA" (as
       described in question 1) may still occur until all users have
       installed the Service Pack.

15. Q. How can I get a complete list of all the problems fixed and
       differences in the Service Pack?

    A. Search in the Microsoft Access Knowledge Base (KB) for "Jet 2.5."
       You can obtain the Microsoft Access KB Help files by calling the
       Microsoft FastTips system at 1-800-936-4100 and having disks mailed
       to you, or by downloading the files from any of the following
       services. When you connect to one of the following services with
       your account information, follow these instructions to find the KB
       Help files:

         - On Internet, look in DESKAPPS\ACCESS\KB\README.TXT.

         - On GEnie, type "M 505" (without quotation marks).
