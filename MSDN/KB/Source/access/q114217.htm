The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
In Microsoft Access version 1.x, you can extend the behavior of forms,
reports, and controls by writing a function or macro, and then calling
that code when an event occurs.
<P>
In Microsoft Access version 2.0, you can still call macros or functions
directly from events. In addition, you can write event procedures that are
stored in special modules, called form or report modules, for each form or
report. This functionality is similar to how Microsoft Visual Basic stores
procedures for forms.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Comparison of Global Modules and Form and Report Modules</h3>
 
<P>
There are several differences between code in a global module and code in a
form or report module, including the following:

<UL><LI>Identifiers in form and report modules are private to the module's
   form or report. This lets you write less code to accomplish the same
   task. For example, you can use "Me.ControlName.Enable = True" instead
   of "Forms!FormName!ControlName.Enable=True."

<LI>Procedures in form and report modules cannot be called from outside
   the module's form or report. These procedures can only be called from
   the form or report itself, expressions on the form or report, or other
   code in the form or report module.

<LI>A form or report module is stored with its form or report, and moves
   with it when you perform such operations as copy, paste, import, or
   export.

<LI>Deleting a form or report object deletes its associated form or
   report module.

<LI>A form or report module is only loaded into memory when its
   associated form or report is opened, and is discarded when
   its form or report is closed.
<P>
   Note that this affects the behavior of the Compile All, Find, and
   Replace commands. For example, to globally replace an item in all
   modules in your database, you must first open all forms and reports
   with form or report modules. If you do not open the forms and reports
   first, only the contents of global modules will be affected.

<LI>When an error occurs in code in a global module, the module will open
   and the error will be selected for you. When an error occurs in code in
   a form or report module, you are only notified of which event caused the
   error. The form or report module will not open.

<LI>Form and report modules are not listed in the Database window.
<P>
</UL><h3>How to View Code in a Form or Report Module</h3>
 
<P>
Method 1:

<OL><P><LI>Open the form or report in Design view.

<P><LI>From the View menu, choose Code. Or, choose the Code button on
   the toolbar.
<P>
</OL>Method 2:

<OL><P><LI>Open the form or report in Design view. This loads the form
   or report's module into memory.

<P><LI>From the Window menu, choose Database.

<P><LI>In the Database window, choose the Module button.

<P><LI>Open any module.

<P><LI>Press F2. The form or report module will be listed as
   Object.ObjectName (for example, Form.FormName).
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about form and report events, search for "events:
forms" or "events: reports," and then "Events and Event Properties
Reference" using the Microsoft Access Help menu.
