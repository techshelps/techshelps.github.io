The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
This article describes how to determine which snaking column in a report is
current. This determination is useful for:

<UL><LI>Setting columns so that each has an equal number of items.

<LI>Drawing separation lines between the columns.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can determine which column is current by checking the report's Left
property. In a report with snaking columns, the Left property value is
always greater in the second column than in the first column. For example,
assume a report with the following dimensions:
<P>
<PRE>   Left margin: 1 inch
   Right margin: 1 inch
   Report width: 3.5 Inch
   Column spacing: 0
   Items across: 2

</PRE>In the first column, the report's Left property is 1 inch. In the second
column, the report's Left property is 4.5 inches (left margin + report
width = second column Left property). Note that values in the Left property
are measured in twips. One inch contains 1440 twips.
<P>
You can determine if the second column is current without knowing the
report's dimensions by comparing the value of the Left property with the
width of the report. If the value of the Left property is greater than the
width of the report, the second column is current. Note that this method
works only if you click the Same As Detail check box in the Page Setup
dialog box (or Print Setup in version 2.0). To verify the Same As Detail
option setting, open the report in Design view, and then:
<P>
<PRE>   In Microsoft Access 97:

      On the File menu, click Page Setup, and then click the Columns tab.

   In Microsoft Access 7.0:

      On the File menu, click Page Setup, and then click the Layout tab.

   In Microsoft Access 2.0:

      On the File menu, click Print Setup, and then click the More button.

</PRE>You can use this information in conjunction with the report's OnFormat
property to perform a variety of tasks, such as ensuring that each column
has an equal number of items, and drawing lines between the columns.
<P>
NOTE: For an example of using the Left property, please see the Sales
Averages report in the Developer Solutions database, Solutions.mdb (or
Solution.mdb in version 2.0), included with Microsoft Access. The Sales
Averages report is a multiple column report that prints the labels in the
first left-most column of the report. The data prints in the columns after
the labels. For a code example, see the ShippedDate Header OnFormat event
procedure in Design view of the Sales Averages report.
