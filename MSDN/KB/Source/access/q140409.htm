The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses code pages and how they affect Microsoft Access.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A code page allows an operating system (such as Windows 95 or Windows NT)
to provide support for character sets and keyboard layouts used in
different countries. A code page is an ordered set (or table) of characters
with a numeric index assigned to each character. Different types of code
pages are used by the various language editions of Windows to support
particular character sets. For example:

<UL><LI>Single-byte: Supports 256 characters, each identified by a unique 1-byte
   character value. This type of code is used for all European editions
   (such as Latin and non-Latin languages).

<LI>Double-byte (DBCS): Supports thousands of characters, each identified
   by a unique 2-byte character value. This type of code page is used by
   Far Eastern editions (such as Japanese and Chinese Traditional).

<LI>Bi-Directional (BiDi): A single-byte code page that allows for
   bi-directional text. This type is used by Arabic and Hebrew editions.
<P>
</UL>Microsoft Access has many editions which have been translated and
customized (or localized) for different languages. These editions are
designed for specific languages of Windows with a particular code page. The
following features in Microsoft Access are affected by the operating
system's code page:

<UL><LI>Display of fonts on screen and in print.

<LI>Ability to open and run databases designed for different language
   editions. You can, in general, mix language editions that are
   part of the same code page without discrepancies in the user interface
   and functionality of Microsoft Access. However, you cannot open or run a
   database that requires an unsupported code page, such as a Japanese
   database in an English edition of Microsoft Access on a Spanish
   edition of Windows.
<P>

   please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   formats). For more information on how Regional Settings affect Microsoft

   the sort order in  Microsoft Access, please see the following article in

</PRE><LI>Localization of SQL statements. If you create SQL statements in Visual
   Basic for Applications, it is possible to use localized syntax. However,
   for compatibility in different languages, you should use English syntax
   rather than the localized language.

<LI>Arguments for the SetOption and GetOption methods. If you use these
   methods in Visual Basic, you should pass arguments in English rather
   than in the localized language. This helps to maximize compatibility
   with different language editions.

<LI>Localization of keywords and expressions (including those created with
   the Expression Builder). Whenever you create expressions in the
   Expression Builder or use keywords such as "forms" or "reports", you
   should use English rather than the localized language to maximize
   compatibility with different language editions. For more information on
   using keywords, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:
