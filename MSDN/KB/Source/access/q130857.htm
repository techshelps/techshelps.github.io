The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 2.0, 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single- user computers.
<P>
This articles describes tips you can use to design a report whose output
you plan to save to a Rich Text Format (RTF) file using the Output To
command. If you use these tips, the data in the RTF file will appear
similar to the data in the report.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To design a report for output to an RTF file, use these tips:

<UL><LI>Create the report as a single-column report.

<LI>Use the same font for all the controls to ensure consistent spacing
   between rows.

<LI>Choose Size from the Format menu, and then choose To Fit from the menu
   that appears. This adjusts the size of each control, depending on the
   font set for the data that appears in the control.
<P>
   NOTE: The Print Preview and Output To commands use different algorithms
   for calculating text width; therefore, the text may occupy more or less
   space in the RTF file.

<LI>Reduce the amount of blank space above and below the report controls.
   Any vertical space between the controls is converted to whole lines in
   the RTF file. For example, a space of .02 inches can increase to .1667
   inches in the RTF file.

<LI>Make sure controls on the same output row are not too close to each
   other or overlapping. This can cause the Output To command to omit the
   controls or to align the columns incorrectly in the RTF file.

<LI>Use the Align command from the Format menu to ensure that a row of
   controls is aligned properly on the report. If a row of controls is not
   aligned properly, the Output To command may place the controls in
   different rows, causing extra blank space in the RTF file.

<LI>Do not set a report section's CanShrink property to Yes because the
   Output To command does not process the CanShrink property. Setting the
   property may, however, cause extra blank lines in the RTF file.

<LI>Avoid setting a report section's CanGrow property to Yes; it causes two
   extra blank lines per section in the RTF file.
<P>
   NOTE: If you must set the CanGrow property to Yes, you can delete the
   extra blank lines by opening the RTF file in a word processor and
   deleting the extra paragraph marks.
<P>
   NOTE: The problems concerning the use of the CanGrow and CanShrink
<PRE>         Properties no longer occur when using Microsoft Access version 7.0
         or later.

and then "Output To Command (File Menu)" using the Microsoft Access Help
menu.
