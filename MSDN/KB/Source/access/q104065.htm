<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is committed to continually enhancing its entire desktop
database tool family. The two main forces that guide future product
development plans are: responding to your needs through innovation and
solid execution, and sharing these innovations among products.
<P>
The innovations continue with the release of Microsoft Visual Basic
Professional Edition version 3.0 and its ability to directly manipulate
Microsoft Access databases. However, due to this enhanced functionality,
you may have questions about which product will best meet your database
needs. This article will try to help you make that decision by outlining
the important features of Microsoft Access version 1.1 and Visual Basic
Professional Edition version 3.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Access Version 1.1</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access is an interactive end-user tool optimized for
customizability and the creation of database solutions. It is designed
exclusively for database work, with simple, yet powerful, integrated
database tools. These tools, such as data-aware forms and reports, are
designed for manipulating data in the Microsoft Access user interface.
<P>
Manipulating form and report objects is easy with the use of macros and
the macro builder. Microsoft Access also contains the full- featured
Access Basic language, which is very similar to Visual Basic.
<P>
Microsoft Access does not provide the ability to create an executable
database file. This means that customers who receive your Microsoft
Access-developed applications must have either:

<UL><LI>The retail version of Microsoft Access (note that any user who has a
   retail version of Microsoft Access can modify your applications unless
   you implement security on the database or its objects).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The run-time version of Microsoft Access that is provided with the
   Microsoft Access Distribution Kit. The run-time package lets users run
   your application without having to own a full retail copy of Microsoft
   Access, and can be distributed with your applications royalty-free.
<P>
</UL><h3>Microsoft Access Distribution Kit Version 1.1</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Access Distribution Kit (ADK) contains a set of tools and a
run-time package for Microsoft Access. This run-time package allows you to
ship your Microsoft Access-designed applications to users who may not have
Microsoft Access installed on their computers. Note that modifications to
your application cannot be made when the application is running in the
run-time package.
<P>
The ADK comes with advanced developer tools, including:

<UL><LI>Setup toolkit (includes .DLL file version check)

<LI>Help compiler

<LI>Documentation on how to create your own AccessWizards
<P>
</UL><h3>Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition Version 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Visual Basic is optimized for programmer versatility and
extensibility. It is a tool not only for creating database applications,
but other applications as well. It can be used to create multi-function
applications with complete custom control over the user interface. Visual
Basic creates executable (.EXE) files, which contain precompiled code
tuned to load and execute, and are processed through a dynamic link
library (.DLL) called VBRUN300.DLL. The Visual Basic compiler is not
needed to run applications you develop.
<P>
Starting with Visual Basic Professional Edition version 3.0, the Microsoft
Access database engine is also included, giving you complete access to
Microsoft Access-created databases (which can include foreign database
format tables such as Paradox and Btrieve that can be attached to the .MDB
file). However, it does not give you access to other objects in the .MDB
file, such as reports and forms. There is no graphical means of defining
database queries, so you must construct them in code. Visual Basic also
does not provide the ability to modify the security of an .MDB file.
Instead, you must implement security through the Microsoft Access security
interface.
<P>
To distribute your Visual Basic applications, you need only distribute the
.EXE file that you developed, the VBRUN300.DLL file, the .MDB file, and
any other miscellaneous files your application requires. Users of your
applications are not required to have Microsoft Access or Visual Basic to
run your applications.
<P>
The only way that users can modify your application's objects is if you
implement the ability for them to do so in your code, or if you supply the
source code to your users.
<P>
Essentially, Microsoft Visual Basic gives you greater control and freedom
over creation of your applications, but also requires greater
responsibility on your part for managing the code, objects, and so on.
