<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
You cannot open an attached Paradox table from within Microsoft Access, or
you receive an "Unexpected Condition" error message in Paradox when you
attempt to view a table.
<P>
Paradox and Microsoft Access should be able to access the same Paradox
tables simultaneously if there is only one PARADOX.NET file in use by both
programs.
<P>
NOTE: The PARADOX.NET file is called PDOXUSRS.NET in Microsoft Access for
Windows 95 version 7.0. For information about the issues in this article in
Microsoft Access 7.0, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../ACCESS/Q142479.htm">Q142479</A></B>
   TITLE:    : ACC: "Couldn't Open Paradox.Net" Error Message (95/97)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Access</h3>
 
<P>
If you receive the error message "Couldn't open file 'filename'" when you
try to open an attached Paradox table while you are in Microsoft Access,
you may have two PARADOX.NET files. In this case, Microsoft Access may be
using one PARADOX.NET file while Paradox is using the other.
<P>
Another possible cause is the absence of a user name in the
ParadoxUserName entry in the [Paradox ISAM] section in your MSACC20.INI
file (or MSACCESS.INI file in version 1.x). See REFERENCES below for more
information.
<P>
There are other conditions that can cause this error message as well. For
more information, search the Help Index for "Error Messages."
<P>
<P><h3>Paradox</h3>
 
<P>
If you receive an error message similar to
<P>
<PRE>   Unexpected condition: File open (I104) - C:\pdoxdata\yourfile.db
   (Code 5) -- Leaving Paradox

</PRE>when you attempt to open a table while you are in Paradox, the cause is
the same as above: there are two PARADOX.NET files, with Microsoft Access
using one and Paradox using the other.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When you attach a Paradox table (&lt;filename&gt;.DB) in Microsoft Access, file
locking information is maintained by PARADOX.NET, the Paradox network
control file. Paradox requires this file in network environments, but it
is also used in stand-alone configurations.
<P>
Microsoft Access creates a PARADOX.NET file in the Microsoft Access
program directory the first time you try to access Paradox data. An entry
is made in the MSACC20.INI file (or MSACCESS.INI in version 1.x) in the
[Paradox ISAM] section pointing to the location of the file. The
MSACC20.INI file should be in your Windows directory. The entry will be
similar to:
<P>
<PRE>   [Paradox ISAM]
   ParadoxNetPath=C:\ACCESS\

</PRE>Paradox also installs a PARADOX.NET file during normal installation. By
default it is located in the Paradox program directory. The location
of this file is determined by the network administrator during a network
installation.
<P>
To redirect Microsoft Access to the location of the PARADOX.NET file that
Paradox installed, edit the MSACC20.INI file in any text editor, such as
Notepad, and change the path. Do not include the name of the file.
<P>
To change the Paradox configuration to point to the Microsoft Access
PARADOX.NET file, run the NUPDATE.EXE utility. Refer to the Paradox
"Network Administrator's Guide" for more information on this topic.
