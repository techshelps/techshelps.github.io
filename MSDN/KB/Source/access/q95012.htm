<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you try to gain access to a SQL Server, you may receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to connect to data source

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The SQL Server you are trying to gain access to does not have a correct
entry in the [SQLSERVER] section of the WIN.INI file or the SQL server is
down, overloaded, or otherwise unavailable.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this situation, verify that the SQL Server is up and available
and that the entry in the [SQLSERVER] section of the WIN.INI file looks as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   [SQLSERVER]
   MY_SERVER=DBNMP3,\\MY_SERVER\PIPE\SQL\QUERY

</PRE>If there are any spaces in this entry or if the server name in the
\\MY_SERVER\PIPE\SQL\QUERY part of the statement is misspelled, you
will receive the error message.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible that there are other situations which may indirectly
cause this error message. Here are several other things you can check to
troubleshoot this problem:

<UL><LI>Use File Manager to search for multiple, corrupted, or outdated
   copies of these files:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ODBC.DLL - 44736 bytes, dated 10-16-92 or later
      DBNMP3.DLL - 8241 bytes, dated 9-15-92 or later
      SQLSRVR.DLL - 135792 bytes, dated 10-16-92 or later
      NETAPI.DLL - depends on the network being used
      COMMDLG.DLL - 89248 bytes, dated 10-25-92 or later
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The sizes and dates referenced are correct if the files were
   installed by Microsoft Access version 1.0.

<LI>Make sure the files listed above are in appropriate locations. All files
   except NETAPI.DLL are usually installed in the Windows System directory.
   The NETAPI.DLL file is a network specific driver, so it's usually
   located in the network's program directory, which should be in the path.

<LI>Use another application, such as Q+E, SAF, or PowerBuilder, on the same
   computer to attempt to attach to the same data source. If you cannot
   access the data source from another application, there is probably a
   problem with the network (NETAPI.DLL) or with the server, not with
   Microsoft Access or ODBC.

<LI>Attempt to attach to another data source, if available, such as
   another SQL server. If you can attach to another server, then the
   original server may be down or you may need to reconfigure the entry
   for that server using the ODBC Administration Utility.

<LI>Attempt to attach to the same data source from another computer. If
   you cannot access the SQL server from another computer, there may be a
   network wide problem or the server may be down or not communicating.

<LI>Try increasing the ODBC timeout settings in the ODBC section of the
   MSACCESS.INI file.

<LI>Check with the system administrator to see if the SQL server is up,
   available for transactions, and operating correctly.

<LI>Reinstall ODBC after performing a clean boot and renaming the ODBC.DLL,
   DBNMP3.DLL, and SQLSRVR.DLL files.
