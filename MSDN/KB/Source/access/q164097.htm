The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access 97
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
If you run the Setup program after you install Microsoft Access 97 with
the Run From CD-ROM option, and you click Reinstall in the Installation
Maintenance dialog box, Microsoft Access 97 no longer starts. In Microsoft
Windows 95 or Windows NT version 4.0, there is no shortcut for Microsoft
Access 97 on the Programs menu; in Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51, only
the Setup icon remains in the program group. If you try to run
Msaccess.exe directly from the CD-ROM, you receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Access can't find the Visual Basic for Applications
   dynamic-link library (DLL) Vba332.

</PRE>NOTE: This occurs with both Microsoft Access 97 and Microsoft Office 97
Professional Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you click Reinstall in the Installation Maintenance dialog box for a
Run From CD-ROM installation, Setup removes most of the Microsoft Access
97 files and registry entries you need to run the program.
<P>
NOTE: This error may also occur if Microsoft Access 97 Setup does not
complete successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Follow these steps to reinstall Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97
Professional Edition:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Setup program, and click Remove All in the Installation
   Maintenance dialog box.

<P><LI>Start the Setup program again, and select the Run from CD-ROM
   installation option.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you choose not to install Microsoft Office 97 Professional
Edition with the Run From CD option, and instead you select a Typical or
Custom installation, you may receive one of the following error messages
at the end of Setup:
<P>
<PRE>   Bdrintl.dll was unable to register itself in the system registry.

   -or-

   Vbe.dll was unable to register itself in the system registry.

</PRE></OL>When you click OK, you receive the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Office 97 Setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE>These errors do not occur if you have Microsoft Access 97 as a stand-alone
product.
<P>
For more information about these error messages, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../OFFICE/Q162295.htm">Q162295</A></B>
   TITLE     : Err Msg: "Bdrintl.dll Was Unable to Register Itself"

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../OFFICE/Q162627.htm">Q162627</A></B>
   TITLE     : Err Msg: "Vbe.dll Was Unable to Register Itself"

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 97.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Reinstalling Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition Run From CD-ROM also
removes files and registry entries along with the shortcut for Microsoft
Access 97. If you try to run Msaccess.exe directly from the CD-ROM,
Microsoft Access starts without errors but the following features no
longer work:

<UL><LI>Running wizards returns the error message "Microsoft Access: This
   feature isn't installed."
<LI>The Database Wizards tab is changed to DATABASE, and all the wizards
   display their DOS 8.3 file names.
<LI>When you try to replicate or synchronize a database, you receive the
   error "Microsoft Access can't complete this operation because it can't
   find or initialize the dynamic-link library Msrclr35."
