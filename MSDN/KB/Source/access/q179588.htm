The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you open a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file that contains links to
another Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file, you receive one of the following
messages:
<P>
<PRE>   This document contains links. Re-establish links?

   The workbook you opened contains automatic links to information in
   another workbook. Do you want to update this workbook with changes
   made to the other workbook?

</PRE>If you click Yes, you receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   '&lt;filename.xls&gt;' contains incomplete calculation.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The spreadsheet file that you are opening contains links to a second
spreadsheet file, and the second spreadsheet file is the source of a linked
table in a Microsoft Access database. You receive the error after you have
updated the data in the Microsoft Access table that is linked to the second
spreadsheet file.
<P>
In Microsoft Access version 7.0, this error occurs when you export to the
Microsoft Excel 5-7 (*.xls) file format or to the Microsoft Excel 4 (*.xls)
file format. In Microsoft Access 97, you do not receive this error unless
you export the table to the Microsoft Excel 4.0 file format.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this error from occurring, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel, and open the spreadsheet file that is the
   source of the links in the file that you are trying to open.

<P><LI>Press F9, or click Options on the Tools menu, and then click Calc Now on
   the Calculation tab.

<P><LI>Save and close the file.

<P><LI>Open the spreadsheet file containing the links to the file that you
   saved in step 3. Note that you do not receive an error message if you
   click Yes when prompted to update or re-establish the links.
<P>
</OL>If your spreadsheet generates the error described in the "Symptoms" section
when you open it, you must follow these steps every time that you use
Microsoft Access to update the other spreadsheet that is the source of its
links.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
