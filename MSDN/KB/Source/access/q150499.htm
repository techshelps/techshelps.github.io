The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you view and switch between maximized forms, all forms may suddenly
become "un-maximized" (restored).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Change the MinMaxButtons property of the form to either Max Enabled or Both
Enabled.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 7.0
and 97. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: Although switching the BorderStyle property of a form to some
setting other than Dialog will also resolve the problem, the Dialog setting
for this property is not considered a cause of the problem. Dialog boxes,
by design, do not have the capability of being maximized. Therefore, if a
form's BorderStyle property has been set to Dialog, this form cannot be
maximized.
<P>
When switching from form to form, all forms will remain maximized until
focus is placed on a form whose MinMaxButtons property has been set to None
or Min Enabled. At this point, all forms and other Microsoft Access windows
(such as the Database window) that are opened in a maximized state will be
restored.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb and maximize the Database
   window.

<P><LI>Open the Products form in Design view.

<P><LI>Set the form's MinMaxButtons property to None.

<P><LI>Save and close the Products form, and then open the Main Switchboard
   form in Design view.

<P><LI>Set the BorderStyle property of the Main Switchboard to Thin.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Form to open the Main Switchboard form in Form
   view.

<P><LI>Click the Categories button to open the Categories form.

<P><LI>Click Window and then Main Switchboard, and then click the Suppliers
   button to open the Suppliers form.

<P><LI>Click Window and then Main Switchboard, and then click the Products
   button to open the Products form.

<P><LI>Click Window and then Categories.

<P><LI>Click Window and then Products. Note that all the forms are restored.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: When switching from form to form, all other forms will remain
maximized until focus is placed back onto the Products form, where the
MinMaxButtons property has been set to None.
<P>

Index for "MinMaxButtons property," or ask the Microsoft Access 97 Office
Assistant.
