<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
One way to get Microsoft Access output from forms or reports into a text
file is to use the Windows Generic print driver and print to a file.
However, using the Generic print driver (TTY.DRV) can be a little tricky.
Listed below are some hints on how to set up your forms and reports for
the Generic print driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows Generic print driver simulates a line-oriented printer with a
fixed pitch font, like a TTY device or a line printer. Because of this, it
can only print text, and it can only position the text on a grid that is
10 characters per inch in the horizontal direction and 6 lines per inch in
the vertical direction. (By contrast, most Windows print drivers can
position text on any pixel position.)
<P>
This means that any form or report using the Generic print driver to
create a text file should be laid out so that everything lines up with
this character grid.
<P>
Here are some considerations for the form or report layout:

<UL><LI>Ensure that each section of your report has a height that is
   an integral multiple of 1/6".

<LI>Lay out the text items in your report such that each falls on 1/6"
   boundaries.

<LI>Because the default hardware font for most printers is a Courier
   10cpi font, you should set the font for all of your text items to be
   Courier 10.

<LI>Do not use Bold fonts because they will appear three times in your
   output. (The Generic driver simulates bold text by overstriking.)
<P>
</UL>Here are some problems that frequently occur when using the Generic
print driver to do text output:

<UL><LI>Blank lines appear in the output--text items or sections are slightly
   farther apart than 1/6".

<LI>Overlapped lines appear in the output--text items or sections are
   slightly closer together than 1/6"

<LI>Text appears three times in the output--text is formatted as
   Bold.
