The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows,
   version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Macintosh, version 4.0a
<LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use both the Windows version and the Macintosh version of Visual
SourceSafe to aid in cross-platform development, "File or Project Not
Found" errors might occur if you use operations on specific files that are
added from the other platform.
<P>
For example, you may get a "File or project not found" error when you try
to check out a Test1.cpp file on the Macintosh when the file was originally
added from the Windows version of Visual SourceSafe and vice versa.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Non-alphanumeric file names are sorted incorrectly in the project file when
they are added from the Macintosh. You only see this problem if there are 2
files in the project that have the same character sequence before a non-
alphanumeric character in one of the filenames. For example, given
Filename.cpp and File_name.cpp, the error usually occurs when you perform
an operation on the Filename.cpp file. However, wildcard operations are
successful.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Customers experiencing this problem should contact Metrowerks, Inc. for the
latest version 1.0.8 of Code Manager. After installing the new Code Manager
version use the command "mwcm_admin resequence" from Macintosh Programmer's
Workbench (MPW) to resequence the database. Depending on the size of the
database and the connection speed of the Macintosh to the Visual SourceSafe
database location, this could take some time. After you run the resequence,
run the analyze program from the Windows platform with the -f option. It
may be necessary to do this twice. The above information comes from the
Upgrade FAQ included in the Metrowerks 1.0.8 package.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. Metrowerks corrected the sort
method used in its version 1.0.8 of Code Manager (Macintosh Visual
SourceSafe equivalent). Microsoft does not provide Visual SourceSafe client
software for the Macintosh at this time. Customers using the 4.0 build 1322
Macintosh client provided by Microsoft should contact Metrowerks for
pricing and upgrade information.
