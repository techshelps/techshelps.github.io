The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual InterDev, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Files will appear to be checked out or modified by the system's anonymous
user when they are actually checked out to valid SourceSafe accounts.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The machine's Anonymous User account is a member of the Admin user group.
<P>
Visual SourceSafe will always attempt to perform actions as the anonymous
user before trying to use the actual logged-in user's name. Only when an
action exceeds the user rights allowed to the system's anonymous user will
it attempt to authenticate as the actual user. Because the anonymous user
is a member of the Admin group, it will always have the rights that are
required to succeed in checking out files.
<P>
Another possible cause is that the anonymous user has either Author and
Browse, or Author, Browse, and Administer web permissions.
<P>
This can also be caused by using a Windows NT Server that has been
formatted with FAT partitions as the Web server because, unlike drives
formatted with NTFS, FAT drives have no direct way of securing files based
on user id.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Remove the anonymous user from the system's Admin group, and make sure that
the anonymous account does not have permissions to author or administer the
web.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are no known cases where a default installation would cause this
situation. It was first discovered on a machine with manually modified
rights.
<P>
The anonymous user mentioned here is an account name introduced by
Microsoft Internet Information Server. It will have the format
IUSR_&lt;machinename&gt;, and can be found in the Internet Service Manager under
the properties for the World Wide Web Service.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Using the Windows NT User Manager, add the system's anonymous user to
   the group of Admin users.

<P><LI>Check out a file while logged in as a valid user.

<P><LI>Look in Visual SourceSafe on the server and you will see the files
   checked out to the anonymous user rather than the valid user.
