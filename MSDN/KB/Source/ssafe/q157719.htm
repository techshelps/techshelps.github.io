4.0  NOTES FOR USERS OF VISUAL SOURCESAFE 4.0
<P>
Users of Visual SourceSafe 4.x will note a number of major changes to the
product. New features are listed separately above, but some of the
important miscellaneous changes are listed below.
<P>
4.1 No 16-bit Support
<P>
Versions 4 and earlier of Visual SourceSafe came with "16-bit versions"
which could run in MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows 3.1, and Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups. These versions are no longer built with Visual SourceSafe 5.0,
or with any future versions. This means that Visual SourceSafe 5.0 will not
run under DOS or Microsoft Windows 3.x. Windows 95 (or above) or Windows NT
3.51 (or above) is required.
<P>
Your 16-bit users can continue to use Visual SourceSafe 4.0a: the format of
the SourceSafe database did not change between these two releases. These
users will not have the benefit of the new 5.0 features, but they will be
able to continue working with your code. The "SS_16Bit" subdirectory on the
SourceSafe CD contains executables that these users can work with. Note
that you must have a license for every user on your system, whether they
use the 5.0 or 4.0 version of the product.
<P>
If users are running SourceSafe 4.0 directly from the server, your 5.0
upgrade will overwrite their on-line help files. They will no longer be
able to bring up context-sensitive help from within the SourceSafe
Explorer.
<P>
4.2 Get --&gt; Get Latest Version
<P>
The command previously referred to as "Get" is now called "Get Latest
Version."
<P>
4.3 Results Display
<P>
The results of a Visual SourceSafe command (which files were retrieved
after a Get operation) used to be displayed in the "results window," a
floating dialog that appeared, displayed information, and then disappeared.
This has now been replaced with the "results pane," a permanent resident on
the bottom of the Visual SourceSafe main screen (below the project tree and
file list).
<P>
4.4 Multiple Project Support in Visual Basic/Visual C++ Integration
<P>
If you chose the "Prompt for Connect" option in Visual Basic or Visual C++
integration with Visual SourceSafe 4.0, you were given the opportunity to
choose a SourceSafe database whenever you added a project to SourceSafe for
the first time, or retrieved a project from SourceSafe for the first time.
(If you are not familiar with what this paragraph is referring to, you can
skip this note.) You specified a database by typing in a special string
which went in your SRCSAFE.INI file after the Data_Path variable.
<P>
This ability is no longer supported in Visual SourceSafe 5.0, having been
replaced with the (much friendlier) "Open Databases" dialog. The new
functionality is quite different from the old, because it involves choosing
a SRCSAFE.INI file instead of a Data_Path line. Therefore, it may require
some changes on your part to get the new system to work properly. These
changes are described below.
<P>
4.4.1. If you had different SourceSafe installations, with different
SRCSAFE.INI files for each Data_Path, you do not need to take any extra
steps initially. The first time you are prompted for a database, you will
"Browse" to find the alternate SRCSAFE.INI file. Thereafter, you will
simply be able to choose a database from a list whenever you add or
retrieve a project for the first time.
<P>
4.4.2. If you had only one SRCSAFE.INI file, you will need to create more
than one: one for each Data_Path directory. You can simply copy your
existing SRCSAFE.INI file, remove all the Data_Path entries except one, and
remove the parentheses for that one. So each SRCSAFE.INI file should have
only one Data_Path, pointing to one data directory. Then, once again, you
can browse for these paths in the "Open Database" dialog. The recommended
place for putting the new SRCSAFE.INI file is immediately above the DATA
directory it refers to: for instance, for directory \\code\public\vss\data,
create \\code\public\vss\srcsafe.ini. If the SRCSAFE.INI is not in this
location, the "Run SourceSafe" option in your development environment may
not work properly.
<P>
5.0  VISUAL SOURCESAFE HOME PAGE
<P>
Microsoft Visual SourceSafe has a home page on the Internet. This home page
features a variety of information including articles on SourceSafe, a self-
running demo that you can download and run, a collection of helpful
SourceSafe utilities, and much more. The URL for the home page is:
