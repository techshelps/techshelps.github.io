The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are working on a Developer Studio project (DSP) that is source
code controlled (SCC), the SCC project has been branched, and you are
working on the branched version of the DSP, the following occurs:

<OL><P><LI>SCC operations such as Check In and Check Out are carried out in the
   original, not the branched, project.

<P><LI>The working folder for the original SCC project is reset to the working
   folder of the branched project.
<P>
</OL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>The .DSP (Developer Studio Project) and .DSW (Developer Studio
   Workspace) files contain a reference to the SCC project that they were
   initially added to. When those files were branched in the SCC
   application and then opened in Visual Studio, they still referenced the
   project they were added to, not the project they were branched into.

<P><LI>From the SCC standpoint the original project has been opened in a
   different folder (subdirectory), so the working folder setting is
   updated to point to the new location.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The first resolution will work with any SCC provider that integrates with
DevStudio the second is specific to Visual SourceSafe.
<P>
NOTE: Both .DSP and .DSW files are automatically generated with warnings
not to edit them. At this time, however, this problem cannot be resolved
without editing them manually.
<P>
Symptom 1
<P><h3>Resolution 1</h3>
 
<P>
The resolution here assumes that you have also added the workspace file
(DSW) to source control. If this is not the case, ignore references to
checking in and checking out the .DSW, otherwise the resolution is
identical.

<OL><P><LI>Check In or Undo Check Out of all checked out files, and then close
   Developer Studio.

<P><LI>From the SCC branched project, recursively Get all the files into their
   working directories. Do this in the SCC application itself (such as the
   Visual SourceSafe Explorer), not Developer Studio.

<P><LI>Check Out the .DSW and all .DSP files from the branched workspace. As in
   step 2, do this in the SCC application.

<P><LI>Edit the .DSP file(s), and remove the following lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      # PROP Scc_ProjName ""$/&lt;project name&gt;", &lt;physical file name&gt;"
      # PROP Scc_LocalPath "."
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the .DSW, remove the lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      begin source code control
      end source code control
</PRE><P>
   and all lines between them.

<P><LI>Save and Check In the .DSW and .DSP(s).

<P><LI>Delete the &lt;workspace&gt;.OPT file from the working folder of the branched
   project.

<P><LI>Restart Visual Studio and open the local copy of the branched .DSW.

<P><LI>From the DevStudio IDE add the .DSW to source control, this time add it
   to the branched project.
<P>
   Answer Yes to the following message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      A Microsoft Developer Studio project with the same name already
      exists in the selected source control project. Do you want to
      reconnect to the existing project?
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the DevStudio IDE, check out the .DSW.

<P><LI>For each project (.DSP) in the workspace choose Project, Add to Source
   Control, and then add the .DSP back to the corresponding branched SCC
   project. Answer Yes when prompted as in step 8. Also, answer Yes when
   prompted to check out the .DSP file.

<P><LI>Check In the .DSW and all .DSP files.
<P>
</OL>Symptom 1
Resolution 2 (Visual SourceSafe specific)
 

<OL><P><LI>Check In or Undo Check Out of all checked out files, and then close
   Developer Studio.

<P><LI>Check Out the .DSW and all .DSP (if there are multiple projects in the
   workspace) files from the branched project. Do this in the Visual
   SourceSafe Explorer.

<P><LI>Find the physical file names for the branched project(s) by using the SS
   Physical command. Make note of these file names. For additional
   information on finding physical file names, please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../SSAFE/Q131447.htm">Q131447</A></B>
<PRE>   TITLE     : HOWTO: Use PHYSICAL Command to Find SourceSafe Database File

</PRE><P><LI>Edit the .DSP files. Look for all of the lines that look like:
<P>
<P><PRE>      # PROP Scc_ProjName ""$/&lt;project name&gt;", &lt;physical file name&gt;"
</PRE><P>
   Change the project name and the physical file name to match the branched
   project and its physical file name.

<P><LI>Edit the .DSW file. Look for all of the lines that look like:
<P>
<P><PRE>      "$/&lt;project name&gt;", &lt;physical file name&gt;
</PRE><P>
   There will be one line for each .DSP in the workspace, and an additional
   line under the "Global:" section if the .DSW itself is source
   controlled. As in step 4, change the project name and the physical file
   name to match the branched project and its physical file name.

<P><LI>Save and Check In the .DSW and .DSP(s).

<P><LI>Delete the &lt;workspace&gt;.OPT file from the working folder of the branched
   project.

<P><LI>Open the either the local or the Visual SourceSafe copy of the project.
<P>
</OL>Symptom 2:
<P><h3>Resolution</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the original project by clicking File, Open Workspace, Source
   Control in the DevStudio IDE. Select the original SCC project.

<P><LI>The "Create local project.." dialog box appears. In the "Create a new
   project in the folder:" field you will see the working folder of the
   branched project. Change this to the working folder of the original
   project. Click OK to exit this dialog box.

<P><LI>In the Open Workspace dialog box, click Open to reset the working folder
   to the correct location.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
To reproduce the following steps, the Developer Studio project that you use
must be SCC controlled.

<OL><P><LI>In the SCC application, branch the original project into a new project.

<P><LI>In Developer Studio, enlist in the branched SCC project by clicking
   File, Open Workspace, Source Control in Developer Studio, and selecting
   the branched SCC project.

<P><LI>Check Out a file in Developer Studio. Note that in the SCC application,
   the checked out file is in the original, not the branched project. After
   closing the Developer Studio workspace, the working folder for the
   original SCC project is located in the branched project.
