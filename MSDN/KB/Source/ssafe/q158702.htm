<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The ANALYZE database scan and repair tool scans a Visual SourceSafe
database in four different passes. Each pass completes a different database
operation and, depending on the problem found, some passes may take
significantly longer than others. ANALYZE may be re-creating vital Visual
SourceSafe files during these slow periods.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following list is a description of each pass that ANALZYE performs and
any issues that may arise:
<P>
<P><h3>Pass 1 of 4</h3>
 
<P>
ANALYZE builds a project list that it uses throughout passes 2 and 3. All
of the project history logs are validated and compared with the current
child list. ANALYZE also maps memory for all of the files that it plans
to scan. This pass of ANALYZE should be significantly shorter than passes
2 and 3.
<P>
The following error may appear when you are running ANALYZE:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to create the filemapping for the database

</PRE>If this error occurs, you must contact Product Support for assistance. This
is a serious error that may cause severe database problems.
<P>
<P><h3>Pass 2 of 4</h3>
 
<P>
ANALYZE loads the files into memory and validates the log entries for each
file. ANALYZE also validates the parent/child relationship in the file.
This information is used later in pass 3 to rebuild projects, if necessary.
<P>
<P><h3>Pass 3 of 4</h3>
 
<P>
ANALYZE rebuilds the project by using the information in pass 2 to validate
the project. If the project is missing or invalid, ANALYZE traces the files
back up and down the tree to determine the true contents of the project. If
the project does not exist, ANALYZE creates the project. If ANALYZE creates
the project, all of the log entries for the files are created by
referencing the child files. The history of the files is not correct
(correct user and date information), but the history is complete enough to
avoid further database errors.
<P>
<P><h3>Pass 4 of 4</h3>
 
<P>
ANALYZE processes the user and rights system. Any inconsistencies in
these systems are repaired. For the remainder of the pass, ANALYZE cleans
up code.
