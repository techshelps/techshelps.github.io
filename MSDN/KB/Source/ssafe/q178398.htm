The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>The development environment included with:
   - Microsoft Visual Studio 97sp3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After installing the Visual Studio 97 SP3 and opening a project under
source control, you may get the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Visual SourceSafe
   The database is unavailable. Would you like to disable source control
   integration?

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible causes:

<OL><P><LI>You have set up a user name using the Visual SourceSafe administrator
   that is not the same as the user name you use to log into your
   workstation and the SourceSafe user name has a password.

<P><LI>You have the same user name in Visual SourceSafe as you use to log into
   your workstation, but you have deselected "Use network name for
   automatic user log in" in the Visual SourceSafe Administrator, Tools
   menu, Options menu item, General tab.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of the following resolutions as a workaround:

<OL><P><LI>After you start your developer application, but before you open a
   project that is under source control, start the Visual SourceSafe
   Explorer from the Project menu, Source Control submenu in Visual C++ or
   Tools menu, Visual SourceSafe submenu in Visual Basic. This will present
   you with a login dialog. After a successful login, you will be able to
   open the project under source control in Visual Studio.

<P><LI>Using the Visual SourceSafe Administrator, check "Use network name for
   automatic user log in" in the Tools menu, Options menu item, General
   tab. Then make sure that all user names match the login names used to
   log into Windows NT and/or Windows 95. The Visual SourceSafe passwords
   are ignored during login in this case.

<P><LI>If you are using a Visual SourceSafe login name that is different than
   your login name for Windows, then don't use a password.

<P><LI>Roll back to the Service Pack 2 (05.00.2220) version of Ssscc.dll that
   is in SssccSP2.exe.
<P>
   Please see the MORE INFORMATION section for instructions on obtaining
   this file.
<P>
   The following file is the only file included in SssccSP2.exe:
<P>
   - Ssscc.dll, version 05.00.2220

<P><LI>"set" the SSUSER and SSPWD environment variables using the following
   procedure:
<P>
   Method 1
   --------
<P>
   Setting a command prompt shell environment. You need to do this each
   time you open the application.
<P>
   a. Open a command prompt and type something, such as set ssuser=guest.
<P><PRE>      If this user has a password, you must also set the SSPWD variable,
      such as set sspwd=password.
</PRE><P>
   b. While still in the command prompt, use "cd" to change to the install
<P><PRE>      location of your development application and start it up.
</PRE><P>
   Method 2
   --------
<P>
   Setting the Windows shell environment.
<P>
   In Windows NT:
<P>
   a. Right-click My Computer and click the Environment tab.
<P>
   b. Put the cursor in the Variable: text box and type SSUSER.
<P>
   c. Hit tab to the Value: text box and type in a valid Visual SourceSafe
<P><PRE>      login name, such as guest. If this user has a password, you must also
      set the SSPWD variable in the same manner.
</PRE><P>
   d. Click OK.
<P>
   e. Restart Windows NT.
<P>
   In Windows 95:
<P>
   a. Add the following two line to the Autoexec.bat:
<P>
<PRE>         set ssuser=&lt;username&gt;
         set sspwd=&lt;password&gt;

   b. Save and restart Windows 95.
