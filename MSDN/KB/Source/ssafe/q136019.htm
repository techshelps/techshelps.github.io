This article covers some of the most frequently asked questions (FAQ) about
Visual SourceSafe version 4.0 integration with Visual C++ version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. How should set up Visual SourceSafe for a multiple-developer project
      with Visual C++ version 4.0?

   A. Please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../SSAFE/Q135332.htm">Q135332</A></B>
      TITLE     : FAQ: Visual SourceSafe Installation and Setup Issues

      This article includes a detailed discussion comparing Setup.exe,
      which provides Server, Client, and Custom setups, with Netsetup.exe,
      which provides a Network Client setup from an existing Server
      installation.

      Also, the Readme.wri file on the Visual SourceSafe installation disks
      or CD-ROM disc contains excellent information and suggestions for
      installation.

2. Q. I have installed Visual C++ and Visual SourceSafe, but Visual
      SourceSafe is still not available under the Source Control menu
      in the Tools menu. Why?

   A. Please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../SSAFE/Q135332.htm">Q135332</A></B>
      TITLE     : FAQ: Visual SourceSafe Installation and Setup Issues

      The kind of installation you select is as important as the success of
      the installation itself. An additional useful reference for verifying
      registration settings can be found in the following article in the
      Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../SSAFE/Q133018.htm">Q133018</A></B>
      TITLE     : Visual SourceSafe Setup Registration Settings

3. Q. How do I add a Project Workspace to Source Code Control?

   A. If you have installed a Source Code Control Provider, such as Visual
      SourceSafe 4.0, the Tools Menu of the Developer Studio will offer a
      Source Control menu choice. This choice will offer a number of other
      options, including "Add to Source Control."  You can use this option
      to place your newly created or existing project workspace under
      source code control.

4. Q. How do I open a Project Workspace that is under Source Code Control?

   A. Once you have installed a Source Code Control Provider, a new button
      will appear in the dialog box brought up by clicking Open Workspace
      on the File menu. This lets you choose a project currently under
      source code control, and open it just as you would open any project
      workspace stored on the disk.

5. Q. How does Visual C++ 4.0 show whether a given file or project is
      under source code control?

   A. Please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../SSAFE/Q136020.htm">Q136020</A></B>
      TITLE     : How to Use Glyphs in Visual C++ 4.0 with Source Code
                  Control

6. Q. I'm performing an operation to manage my project workspace, and the
      dialog box that comes up has an Advanced button that is unavailable
      (dimmed). Why is it always disabled?

   A. The support within Microsoft Developer Studio is designed to support
      any Source Code Control Provider that meets the required
      specification. The specification is generic enough so that if the
      provider wants to provide advanced features, it can through a
      standard interface. The Advanced button is part of that standard
      interface. Visual SourceSafe will take advantage of it where
      appropriate, and leave it disabled when it isn't useful. Other
      providers may or may not take advantage of this as well.

7. Q. I have a project under Visual SourceSafe control. Why can't I make
      any modifications to my files in this project now?

   A. When anything is under Visual SourceSafe control, the files must
      be checked out of Visual SourceSafe before they can be modified in
      Visual C++. You can check files out either from within Visual C++,
      which is usually the preferred route for Visual C++ projects, or you
      can check out files within the Visual SourceSafe explorer.

8. Q. I have renamed a file in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer. Why is
      the file not renamed in Visual C++?

   A. Visual SourceSafe doesn't have a way to tell Visual C++ to rename a
      file in a given project. On the other hand, Visual C++, through the
      integration component, can tell SourceSafe that a file has been
      renamed. Therefore, the best way to rename a file is to do it within
      Visual C++. This will update the Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

9. Q. Where can I find additional information about Visual SourceSafe?

   A. Please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../SSAFE/Q134369.htm">Q134369</A></B>

      as well as technical information.
