<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are four differences regarding how Visual SourceSafe treats binary
files. The Help file gives only three of them, but the "User's Guide" gives
all four.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>How Visual SourceSafe Treats Binary Files</h3>
 
<P>
There are three differences regarding how Visual SourceSafe treats binary
files that are significant.
<P>
The Help file describes only three differences for how Visual SourceSafe
treats binary files as follows:
<P>

<UL><LI>Internally, Visual SourceSafe's mechanisms for storing changes differs
   for text files (which have distinct lines as units of comparison) and
   binary files (which have no obvious line delimiter).  That's why it is
   important for Visual SourceSafe to correctly identify the type of a
   file. The wrong type does not result in errors, but it makes Visual
   SourceSafe's algorithms much less efficient.

<LI>Another area of difference is with respect to the Show Differences
   command. With a binary file, Visual SourceSafe stores each change as a
   small record of which bytes moved where: useful for reconstructing
   earlier versions, but not for display. Therefore, when you use the Show
   Differences command on a binary file, Visual SourceSafe can tell you if
   the file has changed; but it cannot display how the file has changed.

<LI>The third difference occurs with end-of-line characters. With a text
   file, Visual SourceSafe automatically translates end-of-line characters
   between different operating systems; with a binary file, Visual
   SourceSafe never alters the contents of the file in any way (except for
   keyword expansion).
<P>
</UL>The "User's Guide," however, mentions an additional difference:

<UL><LI>Another difference in Visual SourceSafe's treatment of binary files
   compared with text files is that binary files cannot be merged.
   Therefore, multiple checkouts cannot be done with binary files.
<P>
