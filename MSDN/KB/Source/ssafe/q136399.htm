<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows NT, versions 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows 95, versions 4.0, 5.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Visual Basic, the Project window displays a list of all the form
modules, class modules, and standard modules in the project, as well as a
single resource file, if one is used in the project. To the left of the
file name, is a small icon (called a glyph) which shows the file type.
There are different glyphs for forms, classes, modules, and resource files.
In addition, if the file is read only, there will be a tiny red padlock on
the bottom left hand corner of the VB glyph.
<P>
There can be a second glyph to the left of the Visual Basic file glyph.
This second glyph only appears if the file is under source code control.
The Source Code Control glyphs are the same in Visual SourceSafe as they
are in Visual Basic.
<P>
NOTE: The forms, classes and modules should only be modified when the red
check mark is visible. The red check mark is only visible when you have
checked out the file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The source code control glyphs include the following:

<OL><P><LI>A sheet of paper with the corner folded and a black border indicates
   that the file is under source code control and currently has read only
   status.

<P><LI>A sheet of paper with the corner folded and a gray border indicates that
   the file is under source code control and is currently checked out by
   another user.

<P><LI>A sheet of paper with a red check mark and a black border indicates that
   the file is checked out of source code control to you and currently has
   read/write status.

<P><LI>Multiple sheets of paper with the corner folded and a gray border
   indicates that the file is under source code control, is currently
   being shared with another source code control project, and is currently
   checked out by another user.

<P><LI>Multiple sheets of paper with the corner folded, a red check mark, and
   black border indicates that the file is under source code control, is
   currently being shared with another source code control project, and is
   currently checked out to you.
<P>
</OL>IMPORTANT: Caution should be advised if the sheet of paper with the corner
folded has a black border but neither the tiny padlock nor the red check
mark are present. This indicates the file is under source code control, NOT
checked out, but has read/write status. Anytime a file is not checked out,
it should be marked read-only so you do not accidentally modify the file
without it being checked out. To avoid possible problems, either check the
file out to edit it or set the read-only flag from the Windows Explorer.
<P>
If the Source Code Control Add-in is turned off by clearing the box in
the Add-In Manager, all the source code control glyphs disappear. In
addition, all the source code control menu items are disabled.
