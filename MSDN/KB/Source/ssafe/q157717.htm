2.0  GENERAL NOTES AND TIPS
<P>
2.1  Back Up Your Visual SourceSafe Database, and run ANALYZE
<P>
Before installing an upgrade to Visual SourceSafe, it is very advisable to
back up your previous Visual SourceSafe database. The upgrade process may
involve major data conversion, which is irreversible in the case of
problems.
<P>
Once Visual SourceSafe is installed, it is still advisable to back up your
database on a very regular basis. Note that all Visual SourceSafe backups
should be full backups, not incremental or differential.
<P>
In addition to regular backups, it is advisable to run the ANALYZE program
periodically, to check your Visual SourceSafe database for corruption. If
corruption is found, the ANALYZE program can often be used to repair the
problem. Updates to the ANALYZE tool are posted periodically to the Visual
SourceSafe web site, <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ssafe">http://www.microsoft.com/ssafe.</A></B> You may wish to check
that site to see if there is a version of ANALYZE more recent than the one
shipped with this product.
<P>
2.2  Installing Two or More Visual SourceSafe Databases on One Computer
<P>
The Visual SourceSafe installation was designed for one installation per
computer. There might be occasions when you want to have two or more copies
of Visual SourceSafe installed on your computer. This is difficult,
however, since the second time you run SETUP to create a second server
setup, the program goes into maintenance mode!
<P>
The solution is the REGEDIT program in Windows NT or Windows 95. Go to the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\MS SETUP (ACME)\TABLE FILES. You see
two entries for Visual SourceSafe: SSADMIN.EXE, for the server installation
from the CD-ROM, and SSEXP.EXE, for the network client setup. Delete these
two entries and run SETUP again.
<P>
2.3  Loss of Network Connection Produces Numerical Error Message
<P>
If you are in the middle of a Visual SourceSafe session and lose your
connection to a server over the network, the only message you see is a
numerical message informing you of an unknown error. When you see, "unknown
error - 20038," or something similar, you have lost your network
connection. Restart Visual SourceSafe and continue your work.
<P>
2.4  Canceling a Client Setup
<P>
When you choose the Client Setup option to install Visual SourceSafe, you
must type a path for the Visual SourceSafe server directory. If you click
Cancel in the Database Location dialog box, setup displays the following
message in error, "Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 5.0 Setup was completed
successfully." Disregard this message: the setup was not completed.
Although a directory tree was created on your hard disk for the client, you
cannot connect with the database on the server.
<P>
To correct this situation, edit the SRCSAFE.INI file in the local
installation that you have just created. Add a line including the path to
the SRCSAFE.INI file for the Visual SourceSafe database server in a
<PRE>#include statement. You can include a UNC path, for example:

   #include \\SRCSERVR\PUBLIC\VSS\SRCSAFE.INI

</PRE>Alternatively, you can include the path to a mapped drive. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   #include R:\VSS\SRCSAFE.INI

</PRE>2.5  System Date/Time
<P>
Visual SourceSafe uses the date/time which your local computer stores. If
your computer is out of sync with another computer, unpredictable results
may occur. For instance, you may check in a file after someone else, but
SourceSafe may think your check-in happened first, because your system
clock was off!
<P>
The best solution for this problem is to synchronize your local date/time
with the network on a regular basis. This will ensure that all users are in
sync.
