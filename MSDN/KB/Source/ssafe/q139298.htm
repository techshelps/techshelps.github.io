<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
By using project labeling, development teams can label a project, work on
it, and later compile specific revisions of the project that have been
labeled. However, when a project is labeled, it only includes by default
the most recent version of the files. You can override this default
behavior and include a specific file in a project label by using the PIN
and the LABEL features.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the interface and the command line to label and pin specific
files. PIN is a new command that shares a specific version of a file with
the current project. This feature provides more flexibility to development
teams because previous versions of SourceSafe did not allow you to work on
files that were individually labeled. The following example shows you how
to include these specific file revisions in a project label.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Once a file is considered completed, label the file with a descriptive
   label such as Final.

<P><LI>As other files reach completion, label them with the same description.
   You do not have to label files that use the most current revision.

<P><LI>When the project is complete, type the following command at the command
   line for the main project and for each subproject:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SS PIN &lt;Project Path/Filename&gt; "-vl Final"
</PRE>
<P><LI>Once you have called the PIN command for all the necessary files,
   continue the labeling process for the files.
<P>
<P><PRE>      SS LABEL &lt;Project Path/Filename&gt;
</PRE>
<P><LI>Finish the process by Unpinning the revisions so that the files may be
   checked out again. Pinned files cannot be checked out from Visual
   SourceSafe. This operation must also be completed on all subprojects.
<P>
<P><PRE>      SS UNPIN &lt;Project Path/Filename&gt; *.*
</PRE>
<P><LI>As an optional step, remove the Final label from all the files. This
   step is included so that you may reuse the same label at a later time
   without accidentally including the incorrect revision. If you want to
   keep different file labels for each build, you may skip this step.
<P>
<P><PRE>      SS LABEL &lt;Project Path/Filename&gt; "-vl Final" "-l "
</PRE><P>
</OL>The previous steps use the PIN command to lock a specific file revision
in a project. When you label the project, the label is associated with the
version of the files that exists in the project, not the newest version.
Once the project is labeled, you use the LABEL command to remove the label
if necessary. The UNPIN command then tells SourceSafe to use the latest
copy in the project.
