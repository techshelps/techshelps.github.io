The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows NT, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows 95, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Visual SourceSafe uses the Msvcrt20.dll file during installation. If older
versions of the file exist on your computer, depending on which operating
system you're using, this file may conflict with the Visual SourceSafe
installation.
<P>
Msvcrt20.dll is the run-time version of the C language library used by any
product that was created with Microsoft Visual C++ version 2.x. Earlier
versions of this file may be incorrectly installed on your system, which
can also create a conflict during installation.
<P>
You may see one of the following messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup cannot open the destination file
   'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MSVCRT20.DLL'. The file may be in
   use by another application, or marked read-only. Close
   the application or change the file's read-only attribute
   and try again.

   Setup could not open the file
   'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MSVCRT20.DLL'. The file may be in
   use by another application.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 uses Msvcrt20.dll as an actual part of the operating system.
Windows version 3.x, Windows for Workgroups version 3.1x, and Windows NT
version 3.x all require that Msvcrt20.dll be installed in the
\Windows\System directory. The Visual SourceSafe installation program can
recognize the operating system and installs Msvcrt20.dll as needed.
<P>
However, it is possible that earlier versions of Msvcrt20.dll may be
installed on the computer. If an application is loaded and using
Msvcrt20.dll when you attempt to install Visual SourceSafe, the
installation gives an error message and asks you if you want to continue
or not. In this case, shut down all other application, and then continue
with the installation.
<P>
Msvcrt20.dll only used by the Visual SourceSafe setup program. Therefore,
any potential conflict can also occur in the future when using Setup to
add or remove Visual SourceSafe components, reinstall Visual SourceSafe,
or uninstall Visual SourceSafe. To avoid these conflicts, shut down other
applications before installing Visual SourceSafe for the Server or Custom
install options.
<P>
That Msvcrt20.dll is located in the correct directory based on the
operating system you are using. Assuming you installed the operating
system in the \Windows directory, the following shows where the
Msvcrt20.dll file is placed:

<UL><LI>Windows 3.x:   \Windows\System
<LI>Windows 95:    \Windows\System
<LI>Windows NT:    \Windows\System32
<P>
</UL>The C run-time library (Msvcrt20.dll) comes with a number of products,
specifically either Visual C++ or programs created by Visual C++. The
following shows the versions of Msvcrt20.dll that ship with Microsoft
Products. These may be the source of an installation conflict.
<P>
