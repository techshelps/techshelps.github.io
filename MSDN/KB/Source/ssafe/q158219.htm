<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists a series of recommendations that will help you optimize
using SourceSafe over RAS, ISDN, or other modem connections.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In general, you want to minimize the amount of network communication that
will take place during typical SourceSafe operations. In addition, if you
are not using Visual SourceSafe 5.0, you should consider upgrading because
version 5.0 contains a tremendous amount of optimization that may
substantially improve your RAS performance.
<P>
<P><h3>Tips for RAS Optimization</h3>
 
<P>
To optimize SourceSafe for use over a RAS, ISDN or other modem connection,
you should consider implementing some or all of the following
recommendations:
<P>
NOTE: These are not listed in any particular order.

<OL><P><LI>Do not use a Shadow Directory. The Shadow Directory would typically be
   located on a network server. Use of this option will increase the amount
   of data being sent over the network.

<P><LI>Do not use a Journal File. The directory that contains the Journal File
   would typically be located on a network server. Use of this option will
   increase the amount of data being sent over the network.

<P><LI>Do not use Project Security. If Project Security is enabled, every time
   a user selects a file or project, SourceSafe must query the RIGHTS.DAT
   file for information on the user's rights to that file or project. This
   increases the amount of data being sent over the network.

<P><LI>Use the Command Line rather than the SourceSafe Explorer. The SourceSafe
   Explorer will impede performance as it queries the Server for
   information such as glyphs to display, etc.

<P><LI>Configure SourceSafe to use a local SS.INI file. This will reduce the
   amount of information needed to be transferred over the network. Edit
   the USERS.TXT file to change this line:
<P>
   USER_NAME=\USERS\USER_NAME\SS.INI
<P>
   to this line:
<P>
   USER_NAME=&lt;local drive&gt;\SS\USER\SS.INI

<P><LI>Configure SourceSafe to use a local Temp directory. This will reduce the
   amount of information needed to be transferred over the network.

<P><LI>Configure SourceSafe to compare files by CheckSum rather than Contents.
   This will reduce the amount of information needed to be transferred over
   the network. NOTE: There is no appreciable difference in the data
   transfer required to compare files by CheckSum or Time. The recommended
   method here would by Checksum because it is less prone to error.

<P><LI>Do not expand keywords locally. When this option is set, SourceSafe
   modifies the keywords of the file as it is checked-in to the Database.
   It then does a Get to update the local file with the keywords. Disabling
   this option eliminates the Get, thereby reducing the amount of
   information needed to be transferred over the network.
