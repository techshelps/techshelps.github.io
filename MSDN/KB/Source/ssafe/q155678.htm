The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows, versions 4.0,
   4.0a, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Standard Edition, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes several different methods that may be used to share
files between different Visual C++ projects that are under source-code
control.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For best results, mirror your local directory structure on your SourceSafe
server. For example, if your file is in C:\Common\Resources, then add the
file to a SourceSafe project named $/Common/Resources. All of this must be
done using either the SourceSafe Explorer or SS.EXE from the Command
prompt.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Assume that you have some files in C:\Shared that are in SourceSafe project
$/Shared and you have a Visual C++ project in C:\Projects\MyProject that is
in SourceSafe project $/Projects/MyProject. Do the following to add the
files in C:\Shared in the Visual C++ project in C:\Projects\MyProject:

<OL><P><LI>Open the C:\Projects\MyProject Visual C++ project in Developer Studio.

<P><LI>From the Insert menu, select "Files into Project...".

<P><LI>Change the directory to C:\Shared, select the files you wish to include
   in your Visual C++ project, and click the OK button.

<P><LI>When prompted to put the newly-added files under source-code control,
   click NO. The files are already under source-code control and do not
   need to be added.

<P><LI>From the Tools.Source Control menu, select "Refresh Status." Note that
   the icons for the files you have added now reflect the same status as
   the files had in the project that is located in C:\Shared.
<P>
</OL>The advantages of this behavior are:

<OL><P><LI>There is only one copy of each file on the local hard drive.

<P><LI>The source-code control status for all files appears in Visual C++.

<P><LI>All source-code control manipulation occurs within Visual C++.
<P>
</OL>The disadvantages are:

<OL><P><LI>A modified, not-checked-in version of a file in C:\Shared will affect
   all projects on the local machine that use this file.

<P><LI>All files must reside on the same drive (in this case, C:).

<P><LI>The directory structure containing the Visual C++ project and the shared
   files must be mirrored in the SourceSafe database. In the example above,
   $/Shared mirrors C:\Shared and $/Projects/MyProject mirrors
   C:\Projects\MyProject. You may not have the files in C:\Shared in
   SourceSafe project $/ShareFiles for this method to work.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Assume that you have some files that are under source-code control in
C:\Shared and that you have a Visual C++ project in C:\Projects\MyProject
that is also under source-code control. Do the following to add the
files in C:\Shared in the Visual C++ project in C:\Projects\MyProject:

<OL><P><LI>Open the C:\Projects\MyProject Visual C++ project in Developer Studio.

<P><LI>From the Tools.Source Control menu, select "Share from SourceSafe...".

<P><LI>A dialog box with your SourceSafe projects will appear. Highlight the
   project that corresponds to C:\Shared, select the files you wish to
   include in your Visual C++ project, and then click the Share button and
   the Close button.
<P>
</OL>The advantages to this behavior are:

<OL><P><LI>A modified, not-checked-in version of a file in C:\Projects\MyProject
   will only affect C:\Projects\MyProject and not other projects that also
   share the file with this method.

<P><LI>The source-code control status for all files appears in Visual C++.

<P><LI>All source-code control manipulation occurs within Visual C++.

<P><LI>Not all files must reside on the same drive. Different projects may
   reside on different drives.
<P>
</OL>The disadvantage is:

<OL><P><LI>There are multiple copies of each file on the local hard drive, but
   only one copy in the SourceSafe database. In this case, there is a
   copy in C:\Shared and a copy in C:\Projects\MyProject.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
Assume that you have some files that are under source-code control in
D:\Shared and that you have a Visual C++ project in C:\Projects\MyProject
that is also under source-code control. Do the following to add the
files in D:\Shared in the Visual C++ project in C:\Projects\MyProject:

<OL><P><LI>Open the C:\Projects\MyProject Visual C++ project in Developer Studio.

<P><LI>In the Insert menu, select "Files into Project...".

<P><LI>Change the directory to D:\Shared, select the files you wish to include
   in your Visual C++ project, and click the Add button.

<P><LI>When prompted to put the newly-added files under source-code control,
   click NO.
<P>
</OL>The advantages to this behavior are:

<OL><P><LI>There is only one copy of each file on the local hard drive.

<P><LI>Not all files must reside on the same drive. Different projects may
   reside on different drives.
<P>
</OL>The disadvantages are:

<OL><P><LI>A modified, not-checked-in version of a file in D:\Shared will affect
   all projects that use this file.

<P><LI>The source-code control status for the files in D:\Shared will not
   appear in Visual C++.

<P><LI>Not all source-code control manipulation occurs within Visual C++.
   You will need to use the SourceSafe Explorer for the files in
   D:\Shared.
