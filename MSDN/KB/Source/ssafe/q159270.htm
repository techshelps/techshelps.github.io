<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how the merge process works in Visual SourceSafe. The
merge process requires three files: an original, and two modified versions
of the original. During the merge process, Visual SourceSafe makes two
comparisons: one between the original file and the first modified version,
and another between the original file and the second modified version. If a
change is made in only one file, the change is inserted into the merged
file. If there are changes in both files in the same location, then a
conflict exists. The user must resolve a conflict manually.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The first file is a snapshot of the file at the point it was branched. This
file is maintained by Visual SourceSafe. The second and third files are the
current versions of the original file that are located in the two branches
that you want to merge, for example:
<P>
<PRE>Branch1     Branch2
-------     -------

 A           A
 B           B
 C           D
 D           E
 E

</PRE>Visual SourceSafe determines whether "C" was added to Branch1 or deleted
from Branch2 by looking at the first file and determining whether a
deletion or addition occurred.
<P>
To understand how the merge process works, assume that the file looked
like the following when it was branched:
<P>
<P><h3>Original</h3>
 
<P>
A
B
C
D
E
<P>
If you merge Branch1 into Branch2, the result is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>Branch1     Branch2
-------     -------

 A           A
 B           B
 C           D
 D           E
 E

</PRE>During the merge, Visual SourceSafe moves any changes in Branch1 into
Branch2. No changes were made in Branch1. Therefore, both files remain
unchanged.
<P>
If you merge Branch2 into Branch1, the result is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>Branch1      Branch2
-------      -------

 A            A
 B            B
 D            D
 E            E

</PRE>During the merge, Visual SourceSafe moves any changes in Branch2 into
Branch1. "C" was deleted from Branch2. Therefore, the change is reflected
in Branch1.
<P>
Note that Visual SourceSafe assumes incremental changes were made to both
of the changed files. When you merge files that are entirely different, you
might get unexpected results.
