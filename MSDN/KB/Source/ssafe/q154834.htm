The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows,
   version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit and 32-bit,
   for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A subset of the Visual Basic project files are checked out and
modifications have been made to the files. If the rest of the project files
are then checked out without first saving the changes made to the already
checked out files, those changes will be lost.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Visual SourceSafe relies on Visual Basic to make sure all files are saved
before reloading the make file (.VBP or .MAK). It appears that Visual Basic
does not prompt the user to save changes before reloading the make file.
Therefore, the changes are lost.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Be sure to save changes to your project files prior to checking out the
MAK or VBP file. When the Select All Command is chosen during checkout,
the MAK or VBP file is included in the list of files to be checked out.
If the MAK or VBP file is selected to be checked out, Visual Basic will
reload the MAK or VBP file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a project in Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Open a Visual Basic project that is under Source Code Control and has
   two or more forms in the project.

<P><LI>Check out one form. Do not check out the other forms or the .VBP or
   .MAK file

<P><LI>Make a change to the form, such as adding a button. Do not save the
   change.

<P><LI>Select another form in the project window and choose to check out the
   form. In the "check out" dialog, choose SELECT ALL. Note that the list
   does not show the form you have already checked out, but does show
   everything else to check out. Press OK to check out the files.

<P><LI>Note that the form you already had checked out closes. You are never
   prompted to SAVE changes.

<P><LI>Reopen the form that was modified previously. Note that all the changes
   are lost.
<P></OL>
