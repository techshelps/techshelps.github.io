<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, versions 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual
   Basic for Windows, 16-bit and 32-bit editions, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you work with a Visual Basic project in SourceSafe, a special file is
created in your working directory called Mssccprj.scc. This file can never
be added to SourceSafe. It stays in your working directory and stores
important information used by the SourceSafe integration in Visual Basic.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The File Types Options tab in Visual SourceSafe sets options relating to
the types of files you store in Visual SourceSafe. To get to the File Types
tab, click Options on the Visual SourceSafe Explorer Tools menu, and then
click File Types.
<P>
This tab has an option for Create SCC File. Create SCC File dictates when
SourceSafe creates this file. Its default setting (*.vbp, *.mak) means that
whenever you get or add a file with an extension of .vbp (Visual Basic 4.0
project file) or .mak (used by older versions of Visual Basic), SourceSafe
creates the Mssccprj.scc file. This file is very important because without
it, SourceSafe integration inside Visual Basic will not function properly.
<P>
If you are having problems with Visual Basic integration with Visual
SourceSafe, Make sure the Create SCC File option is set. Also, to rebuild
the Mssccprj.scc file, delete the old copy, and then regain access to the
Visual Basic project. It will allow you to point to the existing SourceSafe
project and will display this message:
<P>
<PRE>   The source code control project already has a make file with the same
   name as the one you are adding. Is this the same file?

</PRE>If you answer Yes, the Mssccprj.scc file will be rebuilt.
<P>
The Mssccprj.scc file is a text file. It contains information like that
shown below. There is no reason for anyone to go in and manually make
changes to this file.
<P>
<PRE>      SCC=This is a Source Code Control file
   
      [PROJECT1.VBP]
      SCC_Project_Name="$/Project1", BAAAAAAA
      SCC_Aux_Path=C:\VSS1CLI,

</PRE>If a Visual Basic project is removed and destroyed in Visual SourceSafe,
SourceSafe does not automatically delete the Mssccprj.scc file from the
local working directory. This will cause some strange errors to appear.
<P>
The Mssccprj.scc file is only used by Visual Basic. Visual C++ and other
development environments do not use this file at all. You may not want this
file appearing in your Visual C++ directory. To prevent the appearance of
the Mssccprj.scc file in your Visual C++ directory, remove the *.mak from
this field. (This change should only be made if you do not use
Visual Basic 3.0 .mak files.)
