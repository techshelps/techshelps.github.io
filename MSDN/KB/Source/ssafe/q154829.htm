The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows,
   versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a project's rights are changed under the Rights by Project option, and
the project is moved so it becomes a subproject of a higher level (parent)
project, it will not inherit the parent project's rights.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, create three projects off the root
   project: ProjectA, ProjectB &amp; ProjectC.

<P><LI>In the Visual SourceSafe Administrator, enable Rights by Project. For
   the user Guest, set the rights as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      - ProjectA  - Read
      - ProjectB  - All (leave default)
      - ProjectC  - Read
</PRE><P>
   Close the Project Rights Dialog.

<P><LI>Reopen the Dialog and change the ProjectC rights to All.

<P><LI>In the Explorer, as a user who has all rights, move ProjectB and
   ProjectC into ProjectA. Add a file to each project.

<P><LI>In the Explorer, as the user Guest, attempt to check out the file from
   ProjectA, ProjectB and ProjectC. Note the following results:
<P>
<P><PRE>      - ProjectA: The "Insufficient Rights" dialog appears. The Guest's
<PRE></PRE>        rights were set to Read and never changed. The project was not
        moved.

      - ProjectB: The "Insufficient Rights" dialog appears. The project's
        rights were never changed, so it inherited the settings from the
        parent project.

      - ProjectC: The file can be checked out. Like ProjectB, this file was
        moved but did not inherit rights from the parent as might be
        expected. Changing its rights prior to the move caused it to retain
        those settings.
</PRE>
