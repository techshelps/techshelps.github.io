The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a,
   5.0
<LI>Microsoft Office Developer Edition 97
<P>
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article contains tips to help you use the Source Code Control
component of Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition (ODE) Tools with
Microsoft Visual SourceSafe.
<P>
The article is divided into three sections: Environment, Security, and
Usage.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Environment</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If you move, copy, or rename a database that is under source code
   control, you will no longer be able to use the source code control
   features with that database. However, you can recreate the database from
   the source code control project, and re-enable source code control
   features by pointing to SourceSafe on the Tools menu, and then clicking
   Create Database From SourceSafe Project.

<LI>The Microsoft Access Source Code Control component is specifically
   designed to manage Microsoft Access objects. It is possible to use
   Microsoft Visual SourceSafe or another source code control program to
   include non-Access files in the same source code control project that
   contains your database objects. However, even though those files appear
   as part of your project when you view them in Microsoft Visual
   SourceSafe, you cannot check any files in or out, or get the latest
   version of the files. Manage your non-Access files in a separate source
   code control project.

<LI>If you use a localized version of Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition
   Tools, the user interface for the Microsoft Access Source Code Control
   component appears in the language for that version. If that is not the
   case, check the Regional Settings option in Control Panel to be sure
   it contains the correct language settings for the localized version of
   Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools you are using.
<P>
</UL><h3>Security</h3>
 

<UL><LI>When you add a database to source code control, any security features
   that you have implemented are removed from the database before the
   objects are added to the source code control project. However, by
   default Microsoft Visual SourceSafe maintains its own security on
   projects so that each user either has read-write access (the ability to
   edit files) or read-only access. You can set those permissions for an
   entire project or for specific users. After you finish developing your
   application and remove it from source code control, you can re-implement
   Microsoft Access security features before you distribute the
   application.
<P>
   For more information about issues using Microsoft Visual SourceSafe and
   a secured Microsoft Access database, please see the following article in
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../SSAFE/Q162933.htm">Q162933</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : ACC97: User Without Permissions Can Check Out an Object in
                  VSS

</PRE><LI>If a developer checks out an object, and then forgets his/her password,
   leaves the company, or is out of the office, the Microsoft Visual
   SourceSafe administrator can start the Visual SourceSafe Administrator
   program and change or delete that user's password. Then you can log on
   to the project with the new password and check in the objects or undo
   the check out.
<P>
</UL><h3>Usage</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Always check out an object that is under source code control before you
   make changes to the design of the object.

<LI>If you create a query using a query wizard, you are not prompted to add
   the query to source code control when you save it. To add the query to
   source code control, point to SourceSafe on the Tools menu, and then
   click Add Objects To SourceSafe.

<LI>If you use the Linked Table Manager to refresh the link to a table that
   is under source code control, and you do not have Data and Misc. Objects
   checked out, Microsoft Access does not prompt you to check it out. When
   you do check out Data and Misc. Objects, if the data to which the table
   was originally linked is not available, you receive two error messages
   and then the linked tables are deleted.

<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../SSAFE/Q163346.htm">Q163346</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : ACC97: Linked Table Manager Doesn't Prompt You to Check Out
                  Data

</PRE><LI>If you modify a custom toolbar without checking out Data and Misc.
   Objects, your changes will be lost when you synchronize the source code
   control project with your database. Check out the Data and Misc. Objects
   object before you make changes to your custom toolbars.
<P>
   For more information about this topic, please see the following article
   in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../SSAFE/Q162825.htm">Q162825</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : ACC97: Customizing Command Bar Does Not Prompt for
                  Check-Out

</PRE><LI>Each source code control project must contain only one Data and Misc.
   Objects (.acb) file. If you add a second Data and Misc. Objects
   file to a source code control project, you receive an error when you
   use the Share Objects, Create Database From SourceSafe Project, or
   Refresh Object Status commands.

<LI>Before you create a table using a macro, a make-table query, or Visual
   Basic code, first check out Data and Misc. Objects. If you do not, the
   table appears to be created, and even appears to be under source code
   control, but if you close the database and recreate it from the source
   code control project, or if you use the Get Latest Version command to
   retrieve the most recent version of Data and Misc. Objects, the table is
   removed because it was never actually added to source code control.

   following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../SSAFE/Q159690.htm">Q159690</A></B>
      TITLE     : ACC97: Problem Adding Objects Created in VBA to SourceSafe

</PRE><LI>If you open an object in Design view using Visual Basic code, you are
   not prompted to check out the object. Any changes you make will
   be lost when you synchronize the source code control project with your
   database. If you plan to change the design of an object with Visual
   Basic code, check out the object first.

<LI>When your team finishes development work on a Microsoft Access
   application, you must remove the database from source code control so
   you can distribute it or replicate it. To remove a Microsoft Access
   database from source code control, make sure all changes to the database
   are checked in. Then point to Database Utilities on the Tools menu, and
   click Compact Database. When prompted if you want to remove the
   compacted database from source code control, click Yes. All source code
   control properties are removed from the database.
<P>
   NOTE: You should not attempt to replicate a database while it is under 
   source code control.

<LI>You can work on a database even when you aren't connected to the source
   code control provider. However, before you disconnect from the server,
   check out any objects that you plan to modify.

<LI>When a database is under source code control, only one user at a time
   can connect to it or open it. Create a copy of the database from the
   project for each developer who will work on it. To do so, on each
   developer's computer, point to SourceSafe on the Tools menu, and then
   click Create Database From SourceSafe Project.
