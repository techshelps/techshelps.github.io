3.0  NEW FEATURES IN VISUAL SOURCESAFE 5.0
<P>
Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 5.0 adds many new features. Some of the
highlights include:
<P>
3.1  Archive Utility
<P>
The command-line utilities SSARC and SSRESTOR are the answers to the two
most important features missing from SourceSafe 4.

<UL><LI>How to get rid of old versions of my project (without destroying the
   whole project)

<LI>How to move projects from one SourceSafe database to another (while
   preserving histories)?
<P>
</UL>Note that the archive utility requires administrator-level privileges to
run. If you do not give the "ADMIN" user a SourceSafe password, any user
can run the archive utility.
<P>
3.2  Visual Merge
<P>
When you merge a file (due to multiple checkouts, or after a branch), what
if there is a conflict: more than one user edited the same line of code? In
Visual SourceSafe 4.0, you had to edit a text file and look for greater-
than and less-than markers. In 5.0, the visual merge gives you point-and-
click control over the merging and conflict resolution process.
<P>
3.3  Project Diff
<P>
Click on a project, and then click "Difference." The dialog shows you the
differences between your current project in SourceSafe, and your working
directory: nothing new there. But inside the dialog, you can now Get, Check
Out, Check In, Add, Delete, and Diff files. In other words, project diff is
now a whole new interface, designed to give you a graphical way of
reconciling SourceSafe with your local directory.
<P>
3.4  "Edit" Command
<P>
You can now double-click on a file in the SourceSafe Explorer to edit that
file in
your working directory instead of just viewing the file in SourceSafe.
<P>
3.5  Open Databases
<P>
Inside the SourceSafe Explorer, choose "Open SourceSafe Database" from the
file menu to change your view to another SourceSafe database.
<P>
3.6  Web Features
<P>
The new "Web" menu adds features specifically designed to help users who
use Visual SourceSafe to manage HTML and other Web files.
<P>
3.7  Exclusive Check Out
<P>
If you configure SourceSafe to allow multiple checkouts in the Admin
program, a user can still designate a particular checkout as "exclusive."
An exclusive checkout is represented by a red border around the icon in the
SourceSafe Explorer.
<P>
Note that when the administrator has disabled multiple checkouts, all
checkouts are exclusive.
