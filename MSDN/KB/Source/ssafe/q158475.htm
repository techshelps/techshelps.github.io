<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When viewing the History of Project dialog box for a file, some versions
may appear to be missing. This article describes four scenarios that could
cause this behavior.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Whenever a file is modified in Visual SourceSafe (checked in, branched,
labeled at the file level, etc.), a new log entry for that file is created.
Each of these log entries is represented as a version in the History of
Project dialog box for the file. When viewing the history of a file, these
version numbers are displayed in the left-most column of the window.
Sometimes a version appears to be missing. The following four scenarios
describe conditions that could cause this to happen:

<OL><P><LI>Older versions of Visual SourceSafe created a log entry for the Undo
   Check Out command. By design, this log entry is ignored by the History
   of Project dialog box. If you upgraded your database from an older
   version of SourceSafe, files that were designated "Uncheckout" will
   display missing version numbers. Visual SourceSafe versions 4.0 and
   higher do not create a log entry for the Undo Check Out action.

<P><LI>If you apply a label to a file, a log entry for that label is created.
   If you delete the label (by reapplying the same label later, for
   example), the log entry (and thus, a version) representing the label is
   removed. As a result, the version will appear to be missing in the
   History of Project dialog box.

<P><LI>Under some conditions, when you run the ANALYZE utility with the -f
   option, a log entry (and thus, a version) is removed. ANALYZE will only
   do this if the log entry is damaged beyond repair. If the damaged log
   entry represents a label, the file itself will remain unchanged.
   However, if the log entry represents a checked-in file, previous
   versions of the file may not be recoverable.
<P>
   NOTE: Under this scenario, if the log entry is damaged beyond repair,
   previous versions of the file are unrecoverable anyway so it doesn’t
   matter if ANALYZE removes the log entry.

<P><LI>If a file is checked in from a machine whose internal clock, when
   performing the check in, is set to a time and date earlier than when the
   file was originally added to SourceSafe, its version will not be
   displayed by the Show History command in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer.
   In this scenario, the log entry is created and the file differences are
   saved. The following eight-step procedure describes how to reproduce the
   behavior described in this scenario.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Set up two machines that are connected to a common Visual SourceSafe
   database on a server.

<P><LI>Set the clock on machine number 1 to the current date and time.

<P><LI>Set the clock on machine number 2 to a date and time three or more days
   behind machine number 1. If a file is checked in from a machine whose
   internal clock, when performing the check in, is set to a time and date
   earlier than when the file was originally added to SourceSafe, its
   version will not be displayed by the Show History command in the Visual
   SourceSafe Explorer.

<P><LI>Add a file to the database using the Visual SourceSafe Explorer on
   machine number 1. View this file's history and note that there is one
   item displayed, version 1.

<P><LI>Check the file out from machine number 2, modify it, and check the file
   back in.

<P><LI>View the file's history from either machine number 1 or machine number
   2. The history still displays only one version.

<P><LI>Check the file out from machine number 1, modify it, and check it back
   in.

<P><LI>View the file's history from either machine number 1 or machine number
   2. The History now displays two versions, version 1 and version 3.
