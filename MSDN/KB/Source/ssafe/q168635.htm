<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Diff_Ignore entry controls the factors that are considered or ignored
when you use the Show Differences (File) command on the Tools menu.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual SourceSafe Show Differences (File) command is used to display
all the relevant changes to a file. The Diff_Ignore variable defines what
is a relevant change. You can control the following four issues in this
variable:
<P>
C - case sensitivity
E - end-of-line characters
S - small differences* (See explanation of the "S" switch below)
W - white-space changes
<P>
The arguments for the Diff_Ignore variable contain a list of these four
letters with a dash after any variable that you don't want ignored. In the
following example (also the default), E is the only letter that does not
have a dash after it. As a result, end-of-line characters are the only
items that will be ignored when two files are compared.
<P>
The following example ignores end-of-line differences, and displays all
others:
<P>
<PRE>   Diff_Ignore = c-es-w-

</PRE>If you change the Diff_Ignore variable, as in the following example, then
any differences in white space would be ignored and any differences in the
end-of-line characters would not be ignored.
<P>
The following example ignores white space differences, and displays all
others:
<P>
<PRE>   Diff_Ignore = c-e-s-w

</PRE>* Explanation of the "S" switch: The small differences switch "S" is
misnamed. This option affects small similarities between files, not small
differences.
<P>
When you run a Show Differences (File) on two files, the diff algorithm
tries to match up everything it can. Therefore, if you have two files with
a lot of differences and a few similarities (both have some blank lines, or
lines with curly braces only, etc.), performing a Show Difference (File)
produces a diff file that shows a number of matching items amidst a larger
set of differences. However, all you really have is a few random matches
amidst a larger set of differences.
<P>
Setting the Small Differences switch with a dash after it (Diff_Ignore=c-es-
w) should cause the Show Differences (File) operation to ignore the
spurious similarities between the files.
<P>
The Small Differences switch doesn't really affect the output of the Show
Differences (File) when you use the 'Visual' option, but it can make a huge
difference when you are using the 'Unix' option.
<P>
