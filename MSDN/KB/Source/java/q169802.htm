<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Jword8.exe sample illustrates how to automate Word 97 from a Java
application. This sample shows how to invoke Word 97, make it visible, and
open up an existing Word Document. It also PrintPreviews the document and
Prints it. It uses the Open, PrintPreview, and PrintOut methods of Word 97.

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services


</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Overview of Jword8.exe</h3>
 
<P>
This sample illustrates how to call a COM object like Word 97 from Java. It
shows how you can invoke Word 97, make it visible, and open an existing
Word 97 document. It also PrintPreviews and Prints the document. It makes
use of the methods like Open, PrintPreview and PrintOut and properties like
putVisible of the Word 97 Type Library.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Use Jword8.exe</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Using Visual J++, create a default Java Applet Wizard Applet or
   Application or both.

<P><LI>Run JavaTLB on Microsoft Word 8.0 Object, this creates a Java interface
   for the COM Object. The Java Type Library Wizard is a tool that reads
   type libraries from .TLB, .OLB, .OCX, .DLL, and .EXE files and creates
   Java class files with information about the COM interfaces and methods.
   You need these class files for both compiling and running a Java project
   using COM components. If you are using JACTIVEX, then you will need to
   build this sample using the latest JVC.EXE that ships with the SDK2.0
   for Java.

<P><LI>After you have created Java descriptions of COM components, the output
   window shows two useful types of information, the import statement and
   the SUMMARY.TXT notice. It displays the following Java import statement:
<P>
<P><PRE>      import msword8.*;
</PRE><P>
   Copy this line of text and insert it into the beginning of any Java
   source file that uses the COM component. This has been done for you in
   this sample (see line 9 in JWord8.java).
<P>
   In the summary.txt line you will note that there are no methods listed
   for any of the classes. Recall that when you call COM from Java, you
   use the class file to create the COM component, but you must use the
   interface file to access the COM component. Double-click the Summary.txt
   line to view that file in Developer Studio.

<P><LI>Refer to the public method called "CallWord" in the JWord8.java from the
   sample. This code shows how to use the methods and properties of the
   Word 97 Object.

<P><LI>In Developer Studio, build the applet.

<P><LI>In Developer Studio, run the applet. If this is the first time you have
   run the applet, Developer Studio will prompt you for the name of the
   class. Type: JWord8
<P>
</OL><h3>Security</h3>
 
<P>
COM components can get access to any system resources. As such, they are
both very powerful and potentially very dangerous. In the Java Virtual
Machine (VM) in Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x only trusted class files
can use COM components. Class files from digitally signed CAB files are
trusted.
<P>
If the HTML file is run from Microsoft Developer Studio, the class files
are also trusted. This can be very helpful during applet development.
However, to deliver your applet to other users, you must put it in a signed
CAB file.
<P>
When it is run as an application, the class file must already be on your
machine. When it is run as an applet, the class file may be downloaded to
your machine. There is a potential security threat running downloaded
software. To run a Java applet that uses COM components, the applet code
must be trusted. For more information on trusted class files, see the
CabAndSign sample.
<P>
<P><h3>Project Files in Jword8.exe</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>JWord8.java: the Java source code for the sample.

<P><LI>JWord8Frame.java: the Java source code for the sample as a stand-alone
<P><PRE>    application.
</PRE>
<P><LI>JWord8.dsw: the project workspace file.

<P><LI>JWord8.dsp: the project file.

<P><LI>JWord8.html: the HTML for the sample applet.
