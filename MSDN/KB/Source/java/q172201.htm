The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual J++, version 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to debug from Visual J++, a dialog box appears with the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Failed to connect to Java debug manager. Please make sure your JAVA
   components are correctly installed.'

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Following are two possible causes for this problem:

<UL><LI>Two files needed to debug are either missing or not properly registered
   in the register.

<LI>DCOM settings have affected the debuggers ability to function.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Follow the steps in the MORE INFORMATION section to ensure that these files
exist and are properly registered.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base, as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open a command prompt and change the current directory to
   X:\WINDIR\SYSTEM where X is the drive that contains Windows 95 or
   Windows NT, WINDIR is your Windows directory, and SYSTEM is either
   SYSTEM for Windows 95 or SYSTEM32 for Windows NT.

<P><LI>Make sure the file Jdbgmgr.exe is located in the directory by typing
   "DIR JDBGMGR.EXE." If not, see the section below called "Updating the
   Microsoft VM for Java."

<P><LI>Type "JDBGMGR.EXE /REGSERVER" to add this file's registry entries into
   the registry. You will not see any feedback.

<P><LI>Change the current directory to X:\DEVSTUDIO\SharedIde\Bin where X is
   the drive that contains DevStudio and DEVSTUDIO is the directory that
   DevStudio is installed in.

<P><LI>Make sure the file Cljav.dll is located in the directory by typing "DIR
   CLJAV.DLL". If not, see the section below called "Copying cljav.dll from
   the Visual J++ install CD."

<P><LI>Type "REGSVR32.EXE CLJAV.DLL" to add this file's registry entries into
   the registry. You should see a dialog box that states "DllRegisterServer
   in Cljav.dll succeeded."

<P><LI>Now run Msdev.exe and debug a Java class. You should not see the problem
   anymore.
<P>
</OL><h3>Updating The Microsoft VM for Java</h3>
 
<P>
If the Jdbgmgr.exe file is missing from your System directory, please
obtain the most recent Microsoft VM for Java by following the directions
provided in the following Knowledge Base Article:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../java/Q163637.htm">Q163637</A></B>
   TITLE: INFO: Availability of Current Build of Microsoft VM for Java

</PRE></OL>After updating the VM, continue with step 3 from the 'MORE INFORMATION'
section, above.
<P>
<P><h3>Copying Cljav.dll from the Visualj++ Install CD</h3>
 
<P>
If the Cljav.dll file is missing from the Bin directory, you will need to
copy this file from the install CD. Explore the install CD and navigate to
the Devstudio\Sharedide\Bin directory. If you have VisualStudio97, you will
need to insert CD2 and navigate to the VJ1.1\Devstudio\Sharedide\Bin
directory. Copy the file Cljav.dll to the directory
X:/Devstudio\SharedIde\Bin where X is the drive that contains DevStudio and
Devstudio is the directory that DevStudio is installed in. Continue on to
step 6 in the MORE INFORMATION section, above.
<P>
<P><h3>Check DCOM Settings</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 95 with DCOM, check DCOM's
configuration tool to see if any registered Java/COM objects have been
setup for remote use. If so, turn off these Java/COM objects, reboot, and
try debugging. If the debugger works, use the DCOM tool to turn back on the
remote Java/COM object and test the debugger again.
