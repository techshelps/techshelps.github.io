The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Win32 Virtual Machine for Java
<LI>SDK for Java, versions 2.0, 2.01
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0, 4.01 for Windows 95
   on the following platforms: NT, Win95
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0, 4.01 for Windows NT 4.0
   on the following platform: NT
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When Internet Explorer 4.0 or 4.01 loads an applet from a URL that begins
with an IP address (for example, <B>http://207.68.137.65/java/,</B> as opposed to
<B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/java/)">http://www.microsoft.com/java/),</A></B> the class files of the applet download
very slowly, with a delay of roughly five seconds for each class file. The
name of each class file is displayed in the status bar as it downloads.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In this scenario, builds 2252, 2334, and 2339 of the Virtual Machine for
Java does a reverse lookup via DNS, using the IP address to get the host
name, each time it loads a class file. It queries several sources for the
name, receives a timeout for each one, and finally simply uses the IP
address without knowing the host name.
<P>
The delay for each class is relatively short, but it can add up to several
minutes to download a complex applet.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The available workarounds include the following:

<UL><LI>If the Web server has a name, use that in the URL you connect to.

<LI>Provide a name for the Web server by adding it to a Domain Name Server
   or to your HOSTS file. That name can even be a string that matches the
   IP address.

<LI>Place the applet classes in a CAB file. There will be a short delay
   downloading the CAB file, but no further delay loading the applet.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
If you have or can connect to a Web page with an applet, and you know both
the host name and the IP address of the Web server, you can reproduce this
behavior with the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On a machine with Internet Explorer 4, delete the Temporary Internet
   files.

<P><LI>Start a new copy of Internet Explorer. If you are using Internet
</OL>Explorer 4 with Active Desktop, you will need to use CTRL-Refresh to unload
the cached classes the Virtual Machine for Java has loaded.
<P>
Connect to the Web page, using the IP address of the server, for example
<B>http://10.0.0.0/myfolder/mypage.html.</B>
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
The HOSTS file is documented in the Windows 95 Resource Kit, in a section
titled HOSTS and LMHOSTS files for Windows 95.
