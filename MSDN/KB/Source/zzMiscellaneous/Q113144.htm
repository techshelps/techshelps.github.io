<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides a replacement for the SCHDIST.EXE file that is included
with version 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows.
<P>
For complete information about obtaining and installing the SCHDIST.EXE
file, see the following sections:

<UL><LI>To download the updated file
<LI>To update your SCHDIST.EXE file
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This update contains SCHDIST.EXE, a replacement for the SCHDIST.EXE file
that is included with version 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows. This
update corrects the following problems:

<UL><LI>When multiple Mail for PC Networks postoffices have similar network
   and postoffice names, the Schedule Distribution program
   (SCHDIST.EXE) may not fully validate the entire
   &lt;network&gt;\&lt;postoffice&gt; name address to which the free/busy times
   are addressed.

<LI>Trap D errors occur under OS/2 after Schedule+ processes two non-
   Schedule+ messages.

<LI>Trap D errors occur under OS/2 or under the OS/2 subsystem of
   Windows NT while the ADMIN.PRF file is being updated.

<LI>The Schdist program fails to apply changes from PowerCore's
   Schedule/DOS on the third request.

<LI>The Schdist program does not import free/busy times via an SMTP
   gateway. The line length for word wrapping is too long for Schedule
   Distribution messages and, as a result, some encapsulated gateways
   rewrap the message. This causes the Schdist program to reject the
   message because of an improper format. The line length previously
   set at 82 (80 characters of data plus 2 characters for the
   terminator) was changed to 78.
<P>
   NOTE: If Schedule+ is interacting with the IBM PROFS calendar
   system, version 3.4a of the PROFS Host should be used. Version 3.4
   of the PROFS Host still wraps messages at 80 characters and will
   not function with this new version of SCHDIST.EXE.
<P>
</UL><h3>To Download the Updated File</h3>
 
<P>
The following self-extracting file is available for download from the
Microsoft Software Library:
<P>
<PRE> ~ <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/Schdupd.exe">Schdupd.exe</A> <I>(size: 124917 bytes)</I> 

</PRE>For more information about downloading files from the Microsoft Software
Library, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q119591.htm">Q119591</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE>After you download SCHDUPD.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing
"schdupd" at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of the file.
You should receive the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   SCHDIST.EXE  (194,154 bytes, dated 06-09-94, 2:26 P.M.)
   README.TXT

</PRE><h3>To update your SCHDIST.EXE file</h3>
 
<P>
At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<PRE>   copy &lt;path&gt;:\schdist.exe &lt;destination&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self- extracting
SCHDUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where your
SCHDIST.EXE file currently resides. For example, if you ran the self-
extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your SCHDIST.EXE
file is located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following
command:
<P>
<PRE>   copy d:\test\schdist.exe c:\mailexe

   NOTE: SCHDIST.EXE typically resides on the computer dedicated to
   performing schedule distribution. The Schedule+ INSTALL.EXE program
   places SCHDIST.EXE in the path specified for the Admin files during
   installation. The default path is to the ADMINSCH directory on
   drive C of the computer where INSTALL.EXE is executed. SCHDIST.EXE
   can also be installed to the postoffice server in the Mail
   executables directory. Make sure you update all copies of
   SCHDIST.EXE.
