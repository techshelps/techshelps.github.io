<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains questions and answers about setting up the new MSN,
The Microsoft Network, from the MSN 2.0 CD-ROM.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. What are the system requirements to install and run MSN?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. The system requirements include the following:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - Windows 95
        - A personal computer with a 486/66 or higher processor
        - 14.4 Kbps or higher modem
        - 8 MB of memory required, 16 MB recommended
        - 50 MB available hard disk space
        - CD-ROM drive (2x or higher)
        - VGA or higher resolution graphics card
        - Sound card recommended
        - Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device

      To fully experience MSN, you need a sound card and speakers. MSN
      will function properly without them, but audio is integral to the
      full experience. Also, the MSN Preview program included on the
      CD-ROM uses audio extensively and will not be useful if you do not
      have sound capabilities.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. What is on the MSN CD-ROM?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. There are three items on the CD-ROM:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - MSN Preview: A multimedia preview of the new MSN. It explains
          some of MSN's features and what you can expect as a member.

        - MSN Setup: A program to install and configure the software
          necessary to access the new MSN.

        - The Connection Troubleshooter.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. What if I have problems with installation?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. One way to fix problems you encounter is to quit the program,
       remove the CD-ROM from your CD-ROM drive, and then reinsert it. As
       the MSN CD-ROM starts up again, it should be able to fix most
       problems you might have encountered. If it does not, see the Tips
       And Trouble- shooting section of Help.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why doesn't anything happen when I insert the MSN CD-ROM into the
<P><PRE>       CD-ROM drive?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. AutoPlay is a Windows 95 feature that automatically starts a
       program when you put its CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive. If the MSN
       CD-ROM does not start automatically, your CD-ROM driver does not
       support AutoPlay, or the AutoPlay feature is disabled.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       To start the MSN CD-ROM manually, follow these steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Insert the MSN CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       2. Click the Start button, and then click Run.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       3. In the Open box, type the following line
</PRE><P>
<PRE>             &lt;drive&gt;:\msnstart

          where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

       4. Click OK.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. What are the video card and display requirements for MSN?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. The MSN CD-ROM will not run if your display is set to 16-color
       mode. It is designed to run at 640 x 480 resolution, or higher,
       with a minimum of 256 colors. If your display is set to show 16
       colors, change your display setting to show 256 colors or more
       using these steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. In Control Panel, double-click Display.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       2. Click the Settings tab.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       3. In the Color Palette box, click 256 colors or anything higher
<PRE></PRE>          than 16 colors, and then click OK.

       Some video cards may encounter problems using accelerated video
       drivers, video drivers with more than 256 colors, or high
       resolution video drivers. If you run into display problems, try
       one of the following tips:

        - Switch to a driver supplied with Windows 95.

        - Change to a different display mode. An alternative to using a
          different driver is to change your video mode to a standard
          video mode such as 640 x 480 resolution with 256 colors.

       For details on how to change drivers or switch to a different
       display mode, see your Windows 95 documentation.

       NOTE: NEC computers using the Alliance Promotion video card do not
       work well with the MSN CD-ROM. Please contact your computer dealer
       for assistance.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. When I try to install the Interactive Music Architecture, I receive
<P><PRE>       the error message "MSNAUDIO.ACM is in use."
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. If you receive this error message, click Cancel. MSN Setup should
       continue without a problem.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. Why doesn't a shortcut to the MSN Program Viewer show up on my
<P><PRE>      desktop after I install MSN?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. The shortcut will probably appear when you restart your computer.
       If necessary, you can create a shortcut to the MSN Program Viewer
       with the following steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       2. In the Named box, type:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>             msnviewr.exe

       3. Click Find Now.

       4. Right-click the Msnviewr.exe file, and then click Create
          Shortcut.

       5. Click Yes to place the shortcut on the desktop.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. Why doesn't the MSN Program Viewer open when I double-click the
<P><PRE>       icon on my desktop?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. An error occurred during MSN Setup. Please follow these steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Restart your computer.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       2. Double-click the MSN Program Viewer icon. If it does not open,
<PRE></PRE>          you need to reinstall MSN.

       3. Disable any anti-virus or TSR software running on your computer.

       4. Insert the MSN CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive. The CD-ROM will walk
          you through MSN Setup again.

</PRE><P><LI> Q. Where are the MSN program files located on my computer after I
<P><PRE>       install MSN?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. Most MSN files need to be stored on your computer's system drive.
       This is the drive from which your computer boots (usually drive C:).
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       If you do not have enough space on your system drive, MSN Setup
       will notify you and provide an Expert option. If you select Expert
       installation, you will be prompted several times during
       installation for an alternative storage area (that is, other than
       your system drive).
</PRE>
<PRE>10. Q. What happens if I cancel the Internet Connection Wizard during
       Setup?

    A. If you cancel the Internet Connection Wizard while setting up MSN,
       you must start MSN Setup again.
