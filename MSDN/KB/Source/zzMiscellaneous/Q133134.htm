                               OVERVIEW
                               ========

</PRE>This Application Note includes two WordPerfect text converters for use
with Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows NT.

<UL><LI>Wpft532.cnv is an updated text converter that you can use to save
   Word 6.0 for Windows NT files in WordPerfect 5.x format and to
   import WordPerfect 5.x files to Word 6.0 for Windows NT. ("5.x"
   includes WordPerfect 5.0 and 5.1 for DOS and WordPerfect 5.1 and
   5.2 for Windows.)

<LI>Wpft632.cnv is a new WordPerfect 6.0 text converter that you can
   use to import WordPerfect 6.0 and 6.1 files to Word 6.0 for Windows
   NT. ("6.0 and 6.1" include WordPerfect 6.0 for DOS and WordPerfect
   6.0 and 6.1 for Windows.)
<P>
</UL>Also included is Wpconv.doc, a Word 6.0 document that contains tables
of conversion-limitation information about both converters. The tables
list only the features that are not converted, that are not supported
in one product or the other, or that require comment.
<P>
<P><h2>INSTALLATION AND CONVERSION</h2>
 
<P>
To use these converters with Word for Windows NT, first copy the
Wpft532.cnv and/or Wpft632.cnv files to your Word for Windows NT
program directory (usually C:\Winword), then copy Wpgimp32.flt to the
&lt;WindowsNT&gt;\Msapps\Grphflt subdirectory (where &lt;WindowsNT&gt; is the path
to your Windows NT program directory, usually C:\Winnt35), and then
open a WordPerfect 5.x, 6.0, or 6.1 file. Following are detailed
instructions.
<P>
<P><h3>To copy the WordPerfect files to your computer</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you received a disk with this Application Note, insert the disk
   in the appropriate floppy disk drive.
<P>
   If you downloaded this Application Note from an online service,
   skip to step 2. This procedure assumes that you have already
   downloaded and extracted the compressed file.

<P><LI>From the Main group in Windows Program Manager, choose the MS-DOS
   Prompt icon. When the MS-DOS prompt appears, type the following
   command and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;source&gt;:\wpft*.cnv &lt;NTWord&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;source&gt; is either the letter of your floppy disk drive or
   the path to the directory containing the file you downloaded and
   extracted from online services, and &lt;NTWord&gt; is the path to your
   Word for Windows NT program directory (usually, C:\Winword). For
   example, if you are installing from a floppy disk that you inserted
   in drive A, and C:\Winword is the path to your Word for Windows NT
   program directory, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\wpft*.cnv c:\winword
</PRE><P>
   Or, for example, if you downloaded Gc1183.exe from online services
   to C:\Download and C:\Windows is the path to your Word for Windows
   NT program directory, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\download\wpft*.cnv c:\winword
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This command copies both the 5.x and 6.0/6.1 converters. If,
   for example, you only need the 5.x converter, substitute
   wpft532.cnv for wpft*.cnv in the COPY command examples above.

<P><LI>Copy Wpgimp32.flt to the Msapps\Grphflt subdirectory of your
   Windows NT program directory. For example, if you are installing
   from a floppy disk that you inserted in drive A, and
   C:\Winnt35\Msapps\Grphflt is the path to your Grphflt subdirectory,
   type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\wpgimp32.flt c:\winnt35\msapps\grphflt
</PRE><P>
   If the Grphflt subdirectory contains an earlier version of the
   Wpgimp32.flt file, a message appears asking if it's okay to
   overwrite the file. Press Y and then press ENTER.
<P>
</OL><h3>To open a WordPerfect 5.x, 6.0, or 6.1 file in Word for Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using Word for Windows NT, first quit and restart Word
before continuing with the steps below.

<OL><P><LI>On the Word File menu, click Open.

<P><LI>In the List Files Of Type list, click All Files.

<P><LI>In the File Name box, type or select the filename of the document
   you want to open.
<P>
   If the document you want to open does not appear in the File Name
   box, select a different drive or directory.

<P><LI>Select the Confirm Conversions check box and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>In the Convert File dialog box, click the appropriate WordPerfect
   5.x or 6.0 file format option, and click OK to convert a copy of
   the document to Word format. (When Word converts and opens the
   document, Word automatically installs the converter, and you should
   now be able to open your WordPerfect documents in Word.)
