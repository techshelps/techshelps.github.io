<P>
</UL><h3>Bulletin Boards</h3>
 

<PRE>1. Q. What is a bulletin board?

   A. A bulletin board is an area where MSN members can post questions
      and view posted answers from the bulletin board's manager. A member
      can also read questions and answers posted by other members. Each
      bulletin board is organized by topic. MSN bulletin boards are
      newsgroups that hold MSN content. These bulletin boards are stored
      on the MSNNews server.

2. Q. How do I view MSN bulletin board content?

   A. In MSN Program Viewer, click any link to a bulletin board. For
      example, the Communicate Home Page has links to bulletin boards.

3. Q. Who can exclude me from a forum chat or bulletin board?

   A. Exclusion from forum chats and bulletin boards is at the discretion
      of the individual forum manager.

</PRE><h3>Forums</h3>
 

<PRE>1. Q. What are forums?

   A. Forums are public meeting areas where MSN members can discuss ideas,
      gather information, or find out what other people have to say. Each
      MSN forum is centered around a specific subject, theme, or hobby.
      There are about 80 special-interest forums on MSN.

2. Q. How do I find a forum on MSN?

   A. To find a forum, click MSN Forums on the Communicate home page, and
      then click the forum you want to view.

3. Q. Who do I contact if I have a problem in a forum?

   A. If you have a problem, contact the forum manager for that forum.

4. Q. How do I contact a forum manager?

   A. To contact a forum manager, follow these steps:

      1. In the forum, click Information.

      2. Send e-mail with your question to the listed forum manager.

5. Q. How do I apply to become a forum assistant, host, or manager?

   A. If you would like to become a forum assistant or host, apply to the
      forum manager of the forum that you want to assist or host. If you
      would like to become a forum manager, e-mail your resume and
      proposal to: Content_Provider. Include a list of your interests and
      hobbies.

</PRE><h3>Newsgroups</h3>
 

<PRE>1. Q. What is a newsgroup?

   A. A newsgroup is a public bulletin board where Internet users can
      post, read, and reply to messages that anyone can see. An Internet
      newsgroup can contain hundreds or thousands of articles posted each
      day from all over the world. These newsgroups originate outside of
      MSN, and we have no control over the names of the newsgroups or the
      content of any newsgroup messages. MSN carries newsgroups as part
      of the service to members, but we do not monitor or claim any
      responsibility for what is contained in these groups.

2. Q. How do I subscribe to a newsgroup?

   A. To subscribe to a newsgroup, follow these steps:

      1. In the Newsgroups box, click the Newsgroups icon.

      2. If a News Servers list is displayed, click one of the servers to
         select it.

      3. Scroll down the newsgroup list. Click one of the newsgroups to
         select it.

      4. Click Subscribe.

3. Q. How do I cancel my subscription to a newsgroup?

   A. To cancel a subscription, on the News menu, click Unsubscribe from
      this Newsgroup.

4. Q. How do I view Internet newsgroups?

   A. Throughout MSN, there are links to bulletin boards and newsgroups.
      Click the Communicate page for access to many of them.

      To access newsgroups, follow these steps:

      1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Internet News.

      2. Click Newsgroups.

5. Q. Why are newsgroup messages no longer posted when I return to a
      newsgroup?

   A. Actually, those messages are usually still there. The default in
      Internet News is set to eliminate messages that you have already
      read. To change this or to check for messages that you have read
      before, click All Messages on the View menu. In a minute or two the
      messages reappear.

6. Q. Is there an extra charge for subscribing to a newsgroup?

   A. There is no extra charge for subscribing to a newsgroup. The term
      "subscribe" means that your newsgroup reader will keep track of the
      messages you have read and downloaded from visit to visit. You can
      subscribe and unsubscribe at any time with no additional charge.

7. Q. Why am I unable to find an Internet newsgroup that I believe should
      be there?

   A. MSN tries to keep its feed as current as possible, but occasionally
      we do miss a new group or fall behind. If you send an e-mail message
      to newsmaster@msn.com, we may be able to get the group up more
      quickly.

8. Q. How long are newsgroup messages kept on MSN?

   A. Currently, messages on MSNNews are kept for 2200 hours (about
      92 days). The NetNews server only serves as a feed, and does not
      determine message duration.

9. Q. How do I read newsgroup messages offline?

    A. Once you download the newsgroup message you want to read, you can
       disconnect from your Internet service provider (ISP) and read the
       message offline. To download messages in a newsgroup, follow these
       steps:

       1. In the message list, click the message you want to download. To
          select more than one message for downloading, hold down the CTRL
          key while clicking each message.

       2. On the Off-line menu, click Mark Message For Download.

       3. On the Off-line menu, click Post And Download.

       4. Click File, and then click Disconnect.

10. Q. Why am I unable to access a newsgroup that appears in the newsgroup
       list?

    A. You may not be able to access the newsgroup because it has been
       removed from the server. You can determine this by resetting the
       newsgroup list. If the title of the newsgroup no longer appears in
       the list, it has been removed.

       To reset the newsgroup list, use the following steps:

       1. Click Internet Community (Culture/Newsgroups) located on
          the Communicate page in MSN.

       2. Click Internet News Groups.

       3. Double-click Try Newsgroups Now!

       4. Click Newsgroups.

       5. In the News Servers box, click the Newsgroup icon of the
          newsgroup you usually access.

       6. Click Reset List.

       7. Look in the list of Newsgroups to see if your newsgroup is still
          listed. If not, the newsgroup has been removed from the server.
          If it is still listed, try to access it again.

       message.

       or More Newsgroup Names Could Not Be Verified. Do You Want To Post

</PRE><h3>Internet News</h3>
 

<PRE>1. Q. What is Internet News?

   A. Internet News is a program you can use to view both MSN bulletin
      boards and Internet newsgroups. Within this program, both Internet
      newsgroups and MSN bulletin boards are referred to as newsgroups.

2. Q. How do I uninstall Internet Mail and News?

   A. To uninstall Internet News and Mail, follow these steps:

      1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

      2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

      3. Click the Install/Uninstall tab.

      4. In the list of installed programs, click Internet Mail And News.

      5. Click Add/Remove.

3. Q. What are the paper clips in the newsgroup messages, and how do I
      open attachments?

   A. Paper clips are symbols for file attachments. To view an attachment,
      click the paper clip icon. It displays the file type as well as the
      size. To open the attachment, click the file, move the mouse pointer
      onto the file, and open it when you are prompted.

4. Q. How do I clean up the news files stored on my computer?

   A. Internet News stores information about newsgroups and messages in
      files kept locally on your computer. This reduces the amount of
      traffic (and connection time) necessary to browse through newsgroups
      and messages. To clear out these files, use the following steps:

      1. On the File menu of the Newsgroups box, click Clean Up Files,
         and then click Delete.

      2. When you are prompted if you are sure you want to delete all your
         newsgroup files, click Yes.

      3. Click Close.

5. Q. What is a thread?

   A. A thread is an original message and any posted replies. Threads are
      sorted and grouped according to the original title. For example, a
      thread that starts with a message titled "Please do not post
      binaries in this newsgroup" includes all of the replies titled "RE:
      Please do not post binaries in this newsgroup."

      If you reply to a message and change the title, you start a new
      thread. For example, posting a reply titled "Let's end this thread:
      Please do not post binaries in this newsgroup" starts a new thread.

6. Q. How do I view messages by thread?

   A. To view messages by thread, follow these steps:

      1. On the View menu, point to Sort By.

      2. Click Group Messages By Thread.

      You can also expand or collapse individual threads by clicking the
      plus (+) or minus (-) sign next to the original message, or by
      clicking the message and then clicking Expand or Collapse on the
      View menu.

7. Q. What is SPAM? How do I avoid becoming a SPAMMER?

   A. By definition, SPAM is posting the same or a very similar article
      to 20 or more newsgroups. This is based entirely on quantity, not
      content. You might post the cure for cancer to 20 newsgroups, and it
      would still be SPAM.

      In addition, some e-mail items are determined by Internet consensus
      to be SPAM, even if someone posts the message only once. This is
      simply because similar articles already have been posted thousands
      of times. Items in this category include pyramid scams, MLM schemes,
      1-900 advertisements, and chain letters. Sending unsolicited e-mail,
      especially commercially related e-mail, normally is classified as
      SPAM.

      MSN does not tolerate SPAM sent by its members. If you send SPAM,
      you may receive a warning letter from the MSN Postmaster or MSN
      Management in a minor case. In a more serious case, MSN may
      terminate your account.

      To avoid becoming a SPAMMER, do not send SPAM.
