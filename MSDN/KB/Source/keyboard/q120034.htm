The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Natural Keyboard with IntelliType software version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start the IntelliType Manager, one of the following error messages
is displayed:

<UL><LI>Error, file not found KBDCTL16.DLL
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Error, file not found CPMGR16.DLL
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors occur when you try to start the IntelliType Manager without
restarting Microsoft Windows after initially installing the Microsoft
IntelliType software version 1.0.
<P>
These errors can also occur if you bypass the KBDCPL and SET commands for
the Microsoft IntelliType software and then try to start the IntelliType
Manager. (These commands are loaded from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.)
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct these errors, restart the computer and Windows. Ensure that both
the KBDCPL and SET commands for the Microsoft IntelliType software are
valid within the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The commands should appear as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   SET MSINPUT=C:\MSINPUT
   C:\MSINPUT\KEYBOARD\KBDCPL.EXE /S

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Task Manager does not generate these errors when the KBDCPL and SET
commands are bypassed or when Windows is not restarted after first
installing the Microsoft IntelliType software. However, in such cases, Task
Manager does not reflect any of the following:

<UL><LI>Pre-programmed buttons
<LI>Program and File Launcher
<LI>Application buttons other than the default Program Manager buttons
<LI>Applications in the StartUp group
<LI>Applications on the Load= or Run= lines of the WIN.INI file
<P>
</UL>The settings are not read from the MSINPUT.INI file because this file was
bypassed during bootup and initialization of the AUTOEXEC.BAT statement for
the KBDCPL and SET commands. The default Program and File Launcher
application buttons are File Manager, IntelliType Manager, Paintbrush,
Notepad, Write, and Calculator. The other application buttons are blank by
default.
<P>
When you install the Microsoft IntelliType software from the MS-DOS level,
you are reminded to restart the system before using IntelliType. However,
the Windows installation of the Microsoft Natural Keyboard with IntelliType
software version 1.0 does not directly state that the system must be
rebooted. You are given the option to restart Windows or return to Windows.
