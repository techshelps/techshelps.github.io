The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Sound System version 2.0
<LI>Microsoft Natural Keyboard with IntelliType software version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft IntelliPoint software version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to run Microsoft IntelliType or IntelliPoint software with the
ProofReader utility that ships with the Microsoft Windows Sound System, the
following error is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   The Sound Input Is Busy

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when two input devices attempt to use the sound device
at the same time. The above error can be generated in the Windows Sound
System ProofReader under the following conditions:

<UL><LI>The IntelliType software is installed and you have enabled sounds for
   keyboard activities, and you have chosen the On Entry command in the
   ProofReader.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The IntelliPoint software is installed and you have enabled sounds for
   mouse actions with the Microsoft Home or Standard Mouse, and you have
   chosen the Selected Range command in the ProofReader.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 

<UL><LI>If you are using IntelliType, open the Microsoft Natural Keyboard
   IntelliType Manager. Click the Keyboard Options tab and disable
   Sounds by selecting Sounds Off.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If you are using IntelliPoint, open IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls and
   disable the sound by clicking the Special Effects tab and selecting
   Unassigned under Scheme. As an alternative, you can remove the mouse
   action sound (.WAV file) that is causing the problem by selecting that
   particular mouse action and changing its action sound to None. Both of
   these techniques allow the Windows Sound System ProofReader to proofread
   selected ranges correctly.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using either IntelliType or IntelliPoint, the software generates
a warning when you first activate or change the sounds. These messages are
listed below.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls</h3>
 
<P>
IntelliPoint sound effects may conflict with other multimedia applications.
Microsoft recommends that you disable IntelliPoint sound while running
audio-enabled applications
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft IntelliType</h3>
 
<P>
IntelliType keyboard sounds may conflict with other multimedia
applications. Microsoft recommends that you disable IntelliType keyboard
sounds while running audio-enabled applications
<P>
For more information about these issues, refer to the README.TXT file that
ships with the IntelliType software.
