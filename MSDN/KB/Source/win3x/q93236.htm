The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups was not designed to support the use of IBM LAN
Support drivers. These drivers provide a data link control interface and
perform many of the same functions as Windows for Workgroups real-mode
components.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
IBM LAN Support drivers DXMAxMOD.SYS and DXMCxMOD.SYS form a monolithic
stack and perform a similar function to the Windows for Workgroups real-
mode protocol manager and NDIS driver. Since these drivers do provide
NetBIOS services, the Windows for Workgroups network, including peer-to-
peer functionality, can be made to work with them.
<P>
The drivers cannot be used with Windows for Workgroups unless the protocol
manager (PROTMAN.DOS) and Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS)
driver (for example, IBMTOK.DOS) have been removed from the CONFIG.SYS
file. By making the modifications below, you can configure your Windows for
Workgroups network to run with the IBM LAN Support drivers.
<P>
WARNING: Once these changes have been made, you will undo them if you make
any changes through Control Panel, Networks, Adapters. This writes the
removed files back into the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing IBM LAN Support Drivers (Data Link Control)</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Edit the CONFIG.SYS file and remove the following lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Device=c:\windows\protman.dos /i:c:\windows  &lt;-- the protocol
<PRE></PRE>                                                        manager
      Device=c:\windows\IBMTOK.DOS                 &lt;-- the NDIS
                                                       driver

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following IBM LAN Support driver lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Device=c:\lansup\DXMA0MOD.SYS
      Device=c:\lansup\DXMC0MOD.SYS
      Device=c:\windows\workgrp.sys /n
      Device=c:\lansup\DXMT0MOD.sys O=N ST=10 S=25 C=22 ES=2 EST=2
</PRE><P>
   In the above syntax, ST=stations, S=sessions, C=commands,
   ES=extra.saps and EST=extra.stations.

<P><LI>Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and remove the following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Net Start
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart the computer and Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
</OL>The data link control IBM LAN Support drivers are most commonly used by
3270 terminal emulators to communicate with IBM mainframes and by 5250
terminal emulators to communicate with IBM AS/400s, using Advanced Program-
to-Program Communications (APPC).
<P>
For help with data link control IBM LAN support drivers, call IBM product
support services.
<P>
For additional information on integrating Microsoft data link control with
Windows for Workgroups, consult the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit,
Appendix E.

Support provided by Microsoft Product Support Services for LAN Manager
is available on a fee-basis. For additional information about Microsoft
support options, call the Microsoft Sales Information Center at
