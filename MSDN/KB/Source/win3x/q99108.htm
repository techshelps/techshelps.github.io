The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses several of the most common issues and
procedures for setting up and using Windows for Workgroups Mail.
<P>
This article is divided into the following topics:

<UL><LI>"Re-creating the Mail Initialization Procedure" describes the steps
   you should use in case errors occur when you initialize Mail for
   the first time. These procedures are useful if you incorrectly
   specify the option of connecting to an existing postoffice or
   becoming the Workgroup Postoffice (WGPO).

<LI>"Setting up a Postoffice Across the Network" describes the steps
   for setting up and administering a postoffice on one machine while
   placing the WGPO on another machine. This section includes
   postoffice naming conventions and troubleshooting steps.

<LI>"Creating a WGPO on a Novell NetWare Server" corrects a
   documentation error in the "Windows for Workgroups Mail User's
   Guide" and provides additional information needed to successfully
   set up a Novell NetWare Postoffice.

<LI>"Moving a WGPO from One Machine to Another" describes steps for
   moving a WGPO to a new server without transferring WGPO
   administration responsibilities.

<LI>"Changing the WGPO Administrator" describes steps for transferring
   WGPO administration and management responsibilities from one person
   to another.

<LI>"Allowing Multiple Users to Log On to Windows for Workgroups Mail
   on the Same Machine" explains how to set up one machine for
   multiple postoffice accounts.

<LI>"Removing a Mail User and Installing a New User on a WFWG Machine"
   describes steps for removing a Windows for Workgroups Mail and
   Schedule+ user from a WFWG machine and adding a new user to that
   machine, without reinstalling Windows for Workgroups.

<LI>"Set Access Privileges or Open Other's Appt. Book Options
   Unavailable/Disabled" explains why these options are unavailable.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: There may be situations in which your needs exceed the capabilities
of Windows for Workgroups Mail, even with the procedures outlined below. If
that is the case, you may want to consider upgrading to Microsoft Mail
version 3.0, or higher.
<P>
<P><h2>RE-CREATING THE MAIL INITIALIZATION PROCEDURE</h2>
 
<P>
When you first run Windows for Workgroups Mail, you are given the option to
connect to an existing postoffice or create a new postoffice. After you
make your selection, you cannot go back and change your selection.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reinitialize Mail</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to change your initial selection, you must use the following
steps to reinitialize Mail so that you can select the option you want.

<OL><P><LI>Open the MSMAIL.INI file in an ASCII text editor, such as Microsoft
   Windows Notepad.

<P><LI>Disable the ServerPath= and the login= lines by typing a semicolon (;)
   at the beginning of each line.

<P><LI>Add or edit the CustomInitHandler= line so that it appears as
   follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CustomInitHandler=WGPOMGR.DLL,10
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run Mail. The initialization procedure begins.
<P>
</OL><h3>How Mail Initialization Works</h3>
 
<P>
The initialization procedure is defined for Mail in the MSMAIL.INI file on
the CustomInitHandler= line. This setting is defined as:
<P>
<PRE>   CustomInitHandler=WGPOMGR.DLL,&lt;procedure #&gt;

</PRE></OL>When you run Mail, it checks for the existence of the CustomInitHandler=
line in the MSMAIL.INI file. If this line exists, Mail attempts to execute
the procedure defined by this parameter setting. If the execution fails
because the dynamic-link library (DLL) file WGPOMGR.DLL cannot be found or
the procedure is undefined, Mail continues without reporting an error.
<P>
The procedure, located in WGPOMGR.DLL, displays the Connect Or Create
dialog box to allow you to either connect to an existing remote
postoffice or create a new Workgroup Postoffice.

<UL><LI>If you choose the Cancel button, WGPOMGR.DLL closes Mail.

<LI>If you choose the OK button, WGPOMGR.DLL removes the CustomInitHandler=
   line from the MSMAIL.INI file and returns to Mail, automatically signing
   you in to the postoffice.
<P>
</UL><h2>SETTING UP A POSTOFFICE ACROSS THE NETWORK</h2>
 
<P>
With Windows for Workgroups Mail, the Workgroup Postoffice can be set
up from one computer to another computer across the network.
<P>
For the example below, assume the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The postoffice is set up and administered from machine 1.

<LI>The postoffice files are actually kept on machine 2.
<P>
   NOTE: The user on machine 1 is the Postoffice Manager, but the
   postoffice files are stored on machine 2

<LI>Machine 1 is a Windows for Workgroups machine.

<LI>Machine 2 is a machine with server/sharing capabilities, such as a
   Windows for Workgroups machine, a LAN Manager 2.1 server, or a Novell
   server.
<P>
   NOTE: Novell servers require some special attention. Refer to the
   "Creating a WGPO on a Novell NetWare Server" section in this
   article.
<P>
</UL><h3>Steps to Connect to Other Machines</h3>
 
<P>
After Windows for Workgroups Setup is complete on machine 1, the
designated administrator of the Workgroup Postoffice should take
the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On machine 1, from the Main group, start Workgroups Mail.

<P><LI>Choose Create A New Workgroup Postoffice.

<P><LI>To connect to machine 2, choose the Network button.
<P>
   If Machine 2 is a Windows for Workgroups machine or a LAN Manager
   2.1 server, type the server name and share name (that is,
   &lt;\\server\share&gt;) where you want the postoffice created, then
   choose OK.
<P>
   NOTE: You must have access rights to the server and the share.
<P>
   If machine 2 is a Novell server, you must be logged onto the
   Novell server and have the correct permissions. Then, you
   should connect to the server and use one of these conventions:
<P>
<P><PRE>      server/share:directory
      \\server\share\directory
      remapped drive:\directory
</PRE><P>
   For more information about the Novell naming conventions, check
   your Novell NetWare documentation. For more information about Windows
   for Workgroups naming conventions, see the "Windows for Workgroups
   Server, Share, and Mail Naming Conventions" section in this article.
<P>
   NOTE: Do not use the double-backslash convention mentioned above on
   Novell NetWare 4.x servers. If you do, you receive the following error
   message when you try to connect to the mail server:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Mail could not connect to your mail server.
</PRE><P>
   If you remove one of the backslashes, you do not encounter this error
   message.

<P><LI>After the Workgroup Postoffice is established, check to ensure
   that the postoffice is shared properly on machine 2.
<P>
</OL><h3>Postoffice Naming Conventions</h3>
 
<P>
The following name length limitations exist in Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups Mail:
<P>
<PRE>   Server Name:                15 characters (including spaces)
   Share Name:                 12 characters (including spaces)
   Workgroup Postoffice Share:  8 characters

</PRE></OL>Windows for Workgroups Mail clients cannot connect to a Workgroup
Postoffice if the share name contains more than eight characters, or
if the Workgroup Postoffice server name or share name contains any
spaces.
<P>
For example, the following are examples of invalid Workgroups Postoffice
server or share names:
<P>
<PRE>   \\ser ver\wgpo
   \\server\wg po
   \\server\post office

</PRE>The following is a valid Workgroups Postoffice server or share name:
<P>
<PRE>   \\server\wgpo

</PRE>NOTE: Microsoft recommends that the share name "WGPO" be used for
consistency across all Workgroup Postoffices.
<P>
<P><h3>Resolving Local Postoffice Connection Problems</h3>
 
<P>
If a Windows for Workgroups mail administrator sets up the Workgroup
Postoffice (WGPO) on another workgroup user's machine, that other
user cannot connect to the postoffice and receives one of the
following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   The selected network path cannot be found

   -or-

   This operation is not supported on this machine

</PRE>For example, if the mail administrator, working at a machine named
"Admin", creates the WGPO on a machine called "machine1," the user of
machine1 is unable to connect to the WGPO. To work around this
problem, you must manually edit or create a new MSMAIL.INI file for
machine1.
<P>
NOTE: Windows for Workgroups Mail defaults to uniform naming conventions
(UNC) to specify the location of the postoffice. UNC cannot be used to
connect a user to a share on his/her local machine. Browsing for the WGPO
share on the local machine results in the "not supported" error message.
Manually typing in the UNC name of the share (&lt;machinename&gt;\WGPO) results
in the path not being found, as does typing in the local path (F:\WGPO).
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Copy the MSMAIL.INI file from a machine that is already connected
   to the WGPO.

<P><LI>Edit the MSMAIL.INI file for machine1 as follows:
<P>
   a. Change the ServerPath= statement to reflect the local path.
<P>
   b. Change the login= statement to reflect the machine1 mailbox
<P><PRE>      (as set up by the Mail Administrator).
</PRE>
<P><LI>Copy the newly edited MSMAIL.INI file to the WINDOWS directory on
   machine1.
<P>
</OL>Note that you can use the Mail Administrator's MSMAIL.INI file as the
source for the MSMAIL.INI file for machine1. If you use this file, be
sure to remove all references to the WGPOMGR.DLL file.
<P>
<P><h2>CREATING A WGPO ON A NOVELL NETWARE SERVER</h2>
 
<P>
Appendix B of the "Windows for Workgroups Mail User's Guide" for version
3.1 describes how to create a Workgroup Postoffice (WGPO) on a Novell
NetWare server. Step 7 of the instructions directs the user to create the
WGPO by following the steps explained in Chapter 5 of the "User's Guide."
<P>
The last step in Chapter 5 is to share the newly created WGPO. This step
should NOT be done since the postoffice will be on a NetWare server. If the
user attempts to share the WGPO directory on the NetWare server, the
following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   You can only share resources that are on your computer. If you
   are trying to share a printer, make sure that it is a local
   printer and that the TEMP directory is on a local drive.

</PRE></OL>Sharing the NetWare postoffice is not necessary because connections to
the WGPO are made with the ServerPath= entry in the MSMAIL.INI, which
reflects the appropriate NetWare Workgroup Postoffice location.
<P>
Sharing a redirected, network drive is not possible in Windows for
Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h2>MOVING A WGPO FROM ONE MACHINE TO ANOTHER</h2>
 
<P>
If you need to transfer a WGPO from one server to another and you don't
want to transfer your administrator responsibilities, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Be sure that you have full access to the share where the WGPO will be
   moved.

<P><LI>Use File Manager to move the WGPO to its new location; be sure to move
   all subdirectories.

<P><LI>For each user and the WGPO Administrator, open the MSMAIL.INI file in a
   text editor (such as Notepad), and change the ServerPath= line so that
   it points to the new server. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ServerPath=c:\windows\wgpo
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save your changes, and restart the system.
<P>
</OL>The WGPO administrator should be able to  administer the postoffice an all
users should be able to connect to the WGPO as they did before.
<P>
<P><h2>CHANGING THE WGPO ADMINISTRATOR</h2>
 
<P>
This section describes the procedure for transferring WGPO administrator
responsibilities from one person to another. In this procedure, the
following conventions are used:

<UL><LI>Admin1 is the current Postoffice Administrator.
<LI>Admin2 will become the new Postoffice Administrator.
<P>
</UL>The following fields are required:
<P>
<PRE>   Name:
   Mailbox:
   Password: (You must know the passwords for Admin1 and Admin2.)

</PRE></OL><h3>Steps to Change Administrators</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Copy the MSMAIL.INI file from the WGPO machine to a floppy disk so
    that you can use it later when establishing the Admin2 account.

<P><LI>From Admin1's machine, sign on to Mail, select the Mail option,
    then select Postoffice Manager.

<P><LI>Select the Details option, and write down the required information
    for Admin1 and Admin2 (obtain the passwords from the Administrators;
    passwords don't appear in the details dialog box).

<P><LI>If Admin1 no longer needs a mail account, delete the user account
    for Admin2 and edit the details of the Admin1 account so that it
    matches the new Postoffice Administrator's account (Admin2).

<P><LI>Open Admin1's MSMAIL.INI file in a text editor (such as Notepad)
    and remove the following lines:
<P>
    WGPOMgr1=3.0;Mail;;13
    WGPOMgr2=3.0;Mail;&amp;Postoffice Manager...;14;WGPOMGR.DLL;0;;Manage
       Workgroup Postoffice;MSMAIL.HLP;2870
<P>
    NOTE: These two lines are the last two lines of the [Custom Commands]
    section.

<P><LI>Admin1 should exit and sign out of Mail.

<P><LI>On Admin2's machine, open the MSMAIL.INI file that was copied to the
    floppy disk. Using a text editor (such as Windows Notepad), cut the
    following lines from this file:
<P>
    WGPOMgr1=3.0;Mail;;13
    WGPOMgr2=3.0;Mail;&amp;Postoffice Manager...;14;WGPOMGR.DLL;0;;Manage
       Workgroup Postoffice;MSMAIL.HLP;2870
<P>
    Then, paste these two lines into the [Custom Commands] section of
    Admin2's MSMAIL.INI file (located in the Windows for Workgroups or
    Windows directory). Be sure that these lines are the last two lines in
    the [Custom Commands] section.

<P><LI>Save the changes made to the MSMAIL.INI file, then start Mail.
<P>
    NOTE: A message may appear that states Mail was unable to find
    your .MMF file. A dialog box that displays the .MMF file that was
    detected then appears. Select the .MMF and choose OK to select the
    .MMF file found on the hard disk drive.

<P><LI>Open Mail and select the Mail option to verify the Postoffice
    Administrator option is now available on Admin2's machine.

<P><LI>If necessary, create a user account for Admin1.
<P>
</OL><h2>ALLOWING MULTIPLE USERS TO LOG ON TO WFWG MAIL ON THE SAME MACHINE</h2>
 
<P>
You can set up Windows for Workgroups Mail so that multiple users can
log on with individual Mail files.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Establish Multiple Users</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Set up the Workgroup Postoffice. This cannot be done on the machine that
   will be used by multiple users.

<P><LI>Start Windows for Workgroups Mail on the machine that multiple users
   will be using, log on to the remote Postoffice, and then exit and sign
   out of Mail. This creates an MSMAIL.INI file.

<P><LI>Open the MSMAIL.INI file in a text editor (such as Notepad), and
   under the [Microsoft Mail] section change the line
<P>
<P><PRE>      Noserveroptions=1
</PRE><P>
   to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Noserveroptions=0
</PRE><P>
   This allows you to select the Server option in Mail.

<P><LI>Start Mail again and choose the Options menu.

<P><LI>From the Mail menu, select the Server option and change
   the MMF path in the File box from
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\WINDOWS\MSMAIL.MMF
</PRE><P>
   to
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\WINDOWS\&lt;Mailbox Name&gt;.MMF
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;Mailbox Name&gt; is the name of the user who logged in.

<P><LI>Choose OK. This renames the MSMAIL.MMF file to the Mailbox Name with an
   .MMF extension.

<P><LI>To add another user, rename the MSMAIL.INI file and log on to the
   mail server with the new user's name. Then, exit and sign out of Mail
   and follow steps 2 through 7. Repeat for as many users as necessary.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The last account that you create is the default account name to
use when starting Mail.
<P>
<P><h2>REMOVING A MAIL USER AND INSTALLING A NEW USER ON A WFWG MACHINE</h2>
 
<P>
The postoffice administrator may need to remove and recreate Mail and
Schedule+ accounts on a machine if that machine is used by a different
person than the person for whom Mail and Schedule were first configured.
<P>
Use the following steps to remove a user from a machine and then add a new
user, without having to remove and reinstall Windows for Workgroups:

<OL><P><LI>To remove the old user from the Mail, start Mail and select the
    Postoffice Manager option. Select the name of the user to be
    deleted, and then choose Remove User.

<P><LI>To add the new employee's account, select Add User and then set
    up the mailbox information for the new user. Choose OK to save your
    entries.

<P><LI>On the machine containing the old user's Mail and Schedule+ files,
    start File Manager, making sure that neither Mail nor Schedule+ are
    running, and delete the following files from the \Windows directory:
<P>
       MSMAIL.MMF
       MSMAIL.INI
       SCHDPLUS.INI
       &lt;login&gt;.CAL.&lt;=== where &lt;login&gt; is the old user's login name

<P><LI>Start Mail from the icon on the user's machine.

<P><LI>You should receive a message asking if you want to connect to an
    existing postoffice or create a new postoffice. Select the connect
    to an existing postoffice option.

<P><LI>From the Network Disk Resources dialog box, select the postoffice
    server and share; for example, "\\server\wgpo" (without the quotation
    marks).

<P><LI>You should receive a message asking if you have an account on the
    postoffice. Respond Yes if you have set up the user's account as
    described in step 2.

<P><LI>When the Mail Sign In screen is displayed, sign in to Mail. When the
    Mail screen appears, exit Mail.

<P><LI>To make the necessary changes for the user's Schedule+ account,
    have each user's on the Postoffice (except the user you are
    removing and the user you are setting up) perform these steps:
<P>
    a. Log in to Schedule+.
<P>
    b. Make a change of some type.
<P>
    c. Exit Schedule+
<P>
    d. Restart Schedule+, and then exit a second time.
<P>
    This updates each existing user's .CAL file on the server (except
    the user you are removing from the system).

<P><LI>To set up Schedule+ for the new user, you need to delete the old
    user's .CAL file from the postoffice's CAL subdirectory. These
    files have a numerical filename and a .CAL extension; for example,
    "00000003.CAL."  To determine which .CAL file to delete, look at the
    file dates. All of the .CAL files except the old user's .CAL file
    should have the current day's date because step 9 updated them.
<P>
    Delete the .CAL file that has a noncurrent date.

<P><LI>Log in to Schedule+ using the new user's Mail login name and
    password.
<P>
</OL>SET ACCESS PRIVILEGES OR OPEN OTHER'S APPT. BOOK OPTIONS
UNAVAILABLE/DISABLED
 
<P>
When you run Schedule+ with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
while using Microsoft At Work PC Fax, you cannot choose Set Access
Privileges from the Options menu or Open Other's Appt. Book from the File
menu (both options are unavailable [dimmed]). No error messages appear, and
both Mail and Schedule+ seem to work correctly.
<P>
If you select the FAX Only option when setting up Microsoft At Work PC Fax
instead of the FAX And Email option, Mail works correctly only if it was
set up before the At Work PC Fax software. However, Mail runs Schedule+
offline only, disabling any of the online options in Schedule+.
<P>
When the FAX Only option is selected, the transport entry in the
SCHDPLUS.INI file is changed to the following value:
<P>
<PRE>   ScheduleTransport=TRNOFF

</PRE></OL>To activate the Set Access Privileges option, change the line to read as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   ScheduleTransport=TRNSCHED.DLL

</PRE>When you restart Schedule+ after making this change, the offline calendar
file updates the server's copy of the calendar file, and you can then use
the Set Access Privileges, Open Other's Appt. Book, Work Online, and Work
Offline menu options.
