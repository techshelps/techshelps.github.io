<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides instructions on how to install the Novell ODINSUP
driver to work with Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Novell's ODINSUP driver
allows NDIS 2 protocols (such as MS TCP/IP) to run on top of Novell's ODI
drivers. This behavior is similar to that of the MSODISUP driver that comes
with Windows for Workgroups 3.11. The only difference is that the MSODISUP
driver allows only NDIS 3 protocols to run on top of it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following instructions assist you in setting up Windows for Workgroups
3.11 to run on the Novell ODINSUP driver with NetWare clients that are
using Novell's NETx redirector. By doing this, you can use NDIS 2 protocols
(such as MS TCP/IP or MS DLC) to run on top of the Novell ODI drivers. The
steps below outline setting up Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with the MS
TCP/IP, NetBEUI, and NWLink protocols in addition to Novell's real-mode IPX
protocol. The network card used throughout this article is the 3COM 3c509
Etherlink III.
<P>
<P><h3>Before You Begin</h3>
 
<P>
Since this configuration requires the Novell IPXODI drivers, you must have
your machine set up and attached to a Novell server using IPXODI.COM at MS-
DOS before proceeding to the "Setup Instructions" section below. You should
also set up a working NET.CFG file in the same directory from which you
load LSL.COM
<P>
Be sure to back up your AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that you can restore this
configuration later if necessary.
<P>
<P><h3>Setup Instructions</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Install Windows for Workgroups using the Custom Setup option. In the
   Network Setup dialog box, select the Other option button, select
   Novell, and then choose the Drivers button. Select the network card
   driver for your adapter along with both the NetBEUI and the IPX/SPX
   Compatible Transport with NetBIOS protocols. (Note that for the
   examples in this article, we chose the Etherlink III network adapter.)
   Next, in the same Network Drivers dialog box, choose Setup and choose
   Real Mode NDIS Driver. This is important because even though you are
   actually running an ODI driver with ODINSUP, Windows for Workgroups
   thinks you are running an NDIS driver. Choose OK and continue with
   Setup. Ignore the error messages about ODI drivers. After you finish
   Setup, reboot your computer and start Windows by using the /N switch
   (WIN /N), then install MS TCP/IP according to the directions that come
   with the MS TCP/IP package.
<P>
   NOTE: If there are any other NDIS 2 protocols (such as MS DLC) you want
   to install, install those now. Also, make sure that you choose which
   protocol you want to be the default protocol in the Network Drivers
   dialog box.

<P><LI>After completing the MS TCP/IP installation, edit the SYSTEM.INI file
   and remove the NDIS 2 driver, &lt;ELNK3.DOS&gt;, from the netcard= line of
   the [Network Drivers] section.
<P>
   NOTE: If you are using a different network card, the NDIS network card
   driver (&lt;ELNK3.DOS&gt; in the above example) will be different.

<P><LI>Edit the CONFIG.SYS file and set LASTDRIVE=P. This allows you to use
   the drive letters before P to connect to other Windows for Workgroups
   servers and driver letters after P to connect to NetWare servers. You
   can adjust this to fit your needs; however, Windows for Workgroups
   drives can map only up to and including the drive to which LASTDRIVE
   has been set.

<P><LI>Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that it contains the following lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\WINDOWS\NET INIT
<PRE></PRE>         &lt;==This loads protman and NDIS protocols&gt;
      C:\&lt;PATH&gt;\LSL.COM
      C:\&lt;PATH&gt;\&lt;your network card's ODI MAC driver&gt;.COM
      C:\&lt;PATH&gt;\ODINSUP.COM
      C:\WINDOWS\NET START NETBIND (This binds the protocols to ODINSUP.)
      C:\&lt;PATH&gt;\IPXODI.COM
      C:\&lt;PATH&gt;\NETX.EXE
         (The rest of these files are for MS TCP/IP.)
      C:\WINDOWS\UMB
      C:\WINDOWS\TCPTSR
      C:\WINDOWS\TINYRFC
      C:\WINDOWS\NMTSR.EXE
      C:\WINDOWS\EMSBFR.EXE

</PRE><P><LI>Edit the NET.CFG file and verify that it contains the following lines.
   If these lines don't exist, add them to the appropriate sections of the
   NET.CFG file. If you do not have a NET.CFG file, create one using a
   text editor (such as Microsoft Windows Notepad), and save it in the
   directory from which LSL.COM is executed. Note that some of the lines
   in the NET.CFG file are indented; this indentation must be maintained.
<P>
<P><PRE>      PB BUFFERS 7
      PROTOCOL ODINSUP
<PRE></PRE>         BIND &lt;3c509&gt; (where &lt;3C509&gt; is the filename of your network
                       card's ODI driver.)
         BUFFERED
      LINK DRIVER &lt;3c509&gt; (where &lt;3C509&gt; is the filename of your network
                           card's ODI driver.)
         INT &lt;n&gt; (where &lt;n&gt; is the one-digit interrupt number.)
         MEM &lt;nnnnn&gt; (where &lt;nnnnn&gt; is the five-digit memory address.)
         PORT &lt;nnn&gt; (where &lt;nnn&gt; is the three-digit I/O port address.)

         FRAME ETHERNET_II
         FRAME ETHERNET_SNAP
         PROTOCOL IPX 0 ETHERNET_802.3

   NOTE: If you have been using ODI to attach to a Novell server at DOS and
   you haven't specified the parameters INT, MEM, PORT, DMA, SLOT, and so
   forth in the NET.CFG file, you probably don't need to add them now.
   However, depending on the ODI MAC driver you are using (Novell refers to
   this as the "MLID"), you may need to place these parameters after the
   FRAME lines. Additionally, list your network's frame type FIRST in the
   list of "FRAME ETHERNET_&lt;xxxx&gt;" entries (where &lt;xxxx&gt; will probably be
   &lt;802.3&gt; or &lt;II&gt;).

</PRE><P><LI>Edit the PROTOCOL.INI file by replacing the BINDINGS= lines in the
   [NWLINK], [NETBEUI], [MS$NDISHLP], and [TCPIP] sections with the Novell
   ODI MAC driver (MLID) as follows:
<P>
   [NWLINK]
   ;BINDINGS=&lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; (where &lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; corresponds to your NDIS MAC
<PRE>                         driver; in this case, ELINK3.DOS. The semicolon
                         comments out this line.)
   BINDINGS=&lt;x3c509&gt; (where &lt;x3c509&gt; corresponds to your ODI MLID;
                      in this case, 3c509.COM. The "x" must be added if the
                      ODI MLID filename begins with a numeral.)

   [NETBEUI]
   ;BINDINGS=&lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; (where &lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; corresponds to your NDIS MAC
                         driver; in this case, ELINK3.DOS. The semicolon
                         comments out this line.)
   BINDINGS=&lt;x3c509&gt; (where &lt;x3c509&gt; corresponds to your ODI MLID;
                      in this case, 3c509.COM. The "x" must be added if the
                      ODI MLID filename begins with a numeral.)
   LANABASE=0
   SESSIONS=10
   NCBS=12
   DriverName=netbeui$

   [MS$NDISHLP]
   DriverName=ndishlp$
   ;BINDINGS=&lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; (where &lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; corresponds to your NDIS MAC
                         driver; in this case, ELINK3.DOS. The semicolon
                         comments out this line.)
   BINDINGS=&lt;x3c509&gt; (where &lt;x3c509&gt; corresponds to your ODI MLID;
                      in this case, 3c509.COM. The "x" must be added if the
                      ODI MLID filename begins with a numeral.)

   [TCPIP]
   IPAddress0=&lt;130 25 40 20&gt; (where &lt;130 25 40 20&gt; corresponds to your own
                              IP Addresses.)
   DefaultGateway0=130 25 0 1
   SubNetMask0=255 255 0 0
   NBSessions=6
   NetFiles=C:\WINDOWS
   DriverName=TCPIP$
   ;BINDINGS=&lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; (where &lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; corresponds to your NDIS MAC
                         driver; in this case, ELINK3.DOS. The semicolon
                         comments out this line.)
   BINDINGS=&lt;x3c509&gt; (where &lt;x3c509&gt; corresponds to your ODI MLID;
                      in this case, 3c509.COM. The "x" must be added if the
                      ODI MLID filename begins with a numeral.)
   LANABASE=2

   NOTE: If you are using the Microsoft 32-bit TCP/IP dated 11/21/94, you
   must change the "bindings=" setting in the network card section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file to match the ODI MLID name.

   IMPORTANT: If the ODI MLID filename begins with a numeral, you must
   preface the filename with an "x" (without the quotation marks) in the
   BINDINGS= statement. For example, 3COM's 3C509 network adapter card uses
   an ODI MLID with the filename 3C509.COM. In the PROTOCOL.INI file, the
   BINDINGS= statements would need to be:

      BINDINGS=x3C509

   WARNING: After you make these modifications, do NOT make any changes in
   the Network dialog box of Control Panel. If you do, the AUTOEXEC.BAT,
   SYSTEM.INI and PROTOCOL.INI files will be overwritten. You should make
   backup copies of these files in case this occurs.
