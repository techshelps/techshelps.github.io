</PRE>The device_type is the type of device, and the driver_name is the
filename for the device driver installed for that device type.
Parameters that are specific to a device driver may follow the
driver_name. Alternatively, these parameters may be given in a section
with the same name as the device driver:
<P>
<PRE>   [driver_name]
   keyname=value
   .
   .
   .

</PRE>The following sections describe the settings that Windows with
Multimedia Extensions adds to the [drivers] section. Follow these
steps to change any of the settings:

<P><h3>[MULTIMEDIA.SETUP] SECTION</h3>
 
<P>
The [Multimedia.Setup] section records information about the currently
installed audio and video hardware from your input during setup.
Anytime you run Setup after the initial setup, and anytime you select

<P><h2>SECTIONS FOR WINDOWS WITH MULTIMEDIA DEVICE DRIVERS</h2>
 
<P>
As noted earlier in this file, for any device driver described in
the [drivers] section of SYSTEM.INI, parameters may be defined in
a section with that device driver name. The following device-specific
sections define parameters for the default device drivers provided in
Windows with Multimedia Extensions:
<P>
<PRE>   [ibmjoy.drv]
   [sndblst.drv]

</PRE></OL>The following sections describe the entries that may appear in these
sections. (Additional sections may appear for other audio, video, or
peripheral devices installed on the system.)
<P>
[ibmjoy.drv]
axes=&lt;2-or-3&gt;
timeout=&lt;hex-number&gt;
<P>
<PRE>   Defaults: axes=2
            timeout=0x3000

   Purpose: The axes option specifies whether the joystick is
   two-dimensional (2) or three-dimensional (3). The timeout option is
   a hexadecimal value specifying how many times the joystick driver
   is polled before the system determines that a joystick is not
   installed on the system.

   To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

</PRE>[sndblst.drv]
port=&lt;hex-humber&gt;
interrupt=&lt;number&gt;
DisableWarning=&lt;Boolean&gt;
<P>
<PRE>   Defaults: none

   Purpose: The port option specifies the port number for the
   Sound Blaster audio card. This is the port where the jumper on the
   card is set. The interrupt option specifies which interrupt the
   Sound Blaster uses. The DisableWarning option, if enabled, displays
   a warning message if a DOS application running from the Windows
   DOS prompt tries to access the Sound Blaster port given in the port
   option or the interrupt given in the interrupt option. This option
   is enabled by default.
