The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Borland's Paradox version 3.5 runs in any mode of the Microsoft
Windows operating system version 3.0 or 3.1.
<P>
The line "VCPIWarning=FALSE" needs to be inserted in the [386ENH]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file. This line prevents the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   ERROR: you have attempted to run a protected mode application in
   386 enhanced mode.

</PRE>Paradox normally runs in real mode or protected mode. When you run
Windows 3.0 or 3.1 in standard or 386 enhanced mode, Paradox can only
be run in real mode.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>PIF Settings</h3>
 
<P>
Some default program information file (PIF) settings for Paradox 3.5
may lead to problems in the Microsoft Windows operating system version
3.1. Depending on the circumstances, the -SHARE and -REAL parameters
may or may not be desirable. In addition, the KB Required
default setting is set too low in the PIF.
<P>
The Windows 3.1 PIF for Paradox 3.5 uses the following optional
parameters:
<P>
<PRE>   Standard mode: -REAL -SHARE -WIN
   Enhanced mode: -WIN

</PRE>The -REAL parameter slows down execution and limits the program. It is
required for Paradox to run on a network.
<P>
The -SHARE parameter allows file sharing. It also requires that
SHARE.EXE be loaded. If SHARE.EXE is not loaded, Paradox will fail to
load and will state that you do not have access to a required
directory. This message may not be visible to you because the PIF is
set to close on exit. Paradox will start loading and then return to
Windows. To see the message, clear the Close Window On Exit check box
in the PIF.
<P>
The default KB Required PIF setting for Paradox under Windows 3.1 is
set too low. To determine the best setting, experiment with higher
settings in relation to the amount of memory available on the system.
<P>
<P><h3>64K Contiguous Page Frame Requirement</h3>
 
<P>
Paradox uses expanded memory. It requires a 64K contiguous page frame
but does not check if a contiguous page frame is available. If
expanded memory is available, but the page frame is not 64K
contiguous, Paradox will attempt to use expanded memory and it will
crash. To work around the problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Rearrange hardware adapters in the machine to free up a 64K
   contiguous area in the adapter segment (the area from A000 to EFFF
   hexadecimal).
<P>
  -or-

<LI>Disable expanded memory support in the Paradox PIF. (This applies to
   enhanced mode only; if you are using real or standard mode, you must
   disable the external expanded memory manager.)
<P>
</UL><h3>Running Paradox with Other Applications that Use Expanded Memory</h3>
 
<P>
Under Windows 3.0 enhanced mode, expanded memory handles are global.
Paradox assumes that no other applications are using expanded memory
at the same time. If you want to use expanded memory with Paradox, you
must ensure that no other application that also uses expanded memory
is run simultaneously. If another program uses expanded memory along
with Paradox, Paradox may crash. Paradox installs its own expanded
memory manager, even under Windows.
<P>
