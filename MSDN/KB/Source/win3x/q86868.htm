</PRE>The enclosed WW0553 disk contains the Hewlett-Packard (HP[C]) plotter
driver for use with Microsoft Windows version 3.0. The enclosed disk
contains the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   DINSTALL.EXE
   HPPLOT.DRV
   HPPLOT.INF
   README.TXT

</PRE>HPPLOT.DRV supports the following HP plotters:
<P>
<PRE>   HP 7470A    HP ColorPro
   HP 7475A    HP ColorPro with GEC
   HP 7550A    HP DraftPro
   HP 7580A    HP DraftMaster I
   HP 7585A    HP DraftMaster II
   HP 7580B
   HP 7586B

</PRE><h3>Installing the HP Plotter Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Included on this disk is a program called DINSTALL. It will search all
the directories listed in the PATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
for an earlier version of the printer driver and ask if you want to
delete the old driver and replace it with the updated printer driver.
To run DINSTALL, do the following:

<OL><P><LI> Start Windows 3.0 if it is not already running.

<P><LI>Insert the enclosed WW0553 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive.

<P><LI>From Program Manager's File menu, choose Run.

<P><LI>In the Command Line box of the Run dialog box, type the path to
   DINSTALL.EXE on the floppy disk. For example, if the WW0553 disk is
   in drive A, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a:\dinstall
</PRE><P>
   Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>This will load DINSTALL and bring up a Driver Install window. Using
   the mouse or keyboard, select the driver that you want to install
   and then choose the Install button.

<P><LI>If DINSTALL finds an earlier version of the driver, it will ask if
   you want to delete the old HP driver. Choose the Yes button to
   delete it. The old driver will then be deleted and replaced with
   the updated printer driver.

<P><LI>A DINSTALL Info dialog box will appear with the status of the new
   driver when the installation is complete. Choose the OK button to
   close the dialog box and then choose the Exit button to leave the
   installation program.
<P>
</OL>The driver is now installed and you can configure it by choosing the
Printers icon from the Control Panel. For more information on
configuring plotters for use with Windows, refer to pages 163-176 of
the version 3.0 "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
<P>
If DINSTALL does not work, you can install the drivers manually. For
information on installing the drivers manually, please read the
README.TXT file on the enclosed WW0553 disk.
