</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
The WW1138 disk included with this Application Note contains an updated
version of the Calculator accessory that is shipped with Microsoft Windows
3.1x and Windows for Workgroups 3.1x. Previous versions of Calculator
display simple subtraction errors when you subtract two numbers that
include values to the right of the decimal point. While Calculator is
determining how to display the solution, it encounters a loss of precision
and shows an incorrect answer.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: This rounding error is unrelated to the floating-point unit
   (FPU) in the Intel(R) Pentium(R) chip. This problem occurs only in
   Calculator and does not affect Windows, other components in Windows,
   or other Windows-based applications.

</PRE>In addition to correcting the problem described above, the new rounding
algorithm in Calculator causes it to perform more like most hand-held
calculators. For example, if you enter the following equation in the
updated Calculator accessory or in a hand-held calculator
<P>
<PRE>   [(1/3 + 10 - 10) x 3]

</PRE>the result is 0.9999. The result in previous versions of Calculator is 1.0.
The value 0.9999 is generated because significant digits are lost by adding
and subtracting 10. This is a secondary effect of the changes made in
Calculator to correct the precision errors.
<P>
<P><h3>To install the updated files</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Windows, or open an MS-DOS command prompt within Windows.

<P><LI>Rename the existing CALC.EXE file in your Windows directory. For
   example, if Windows is installed in a directory on drive C called
   WINDOWS, type the following commands, pressing ENTER after each
   line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd\windows
      ren calc.exe calc.old
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you received a disk with this Application Note, insert the disk
   in the appropriate floppy disk drive.
<P>
   If you downloaded this Application Note from an online service,
   skip to step 4. This procedure assumes that you have already
   downloaded and extracted the compressed file.

<P><LI>At an MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;source&gt;:\calc.exe &lt;location&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;source&gt; is either the letter of your floppy disk drive or
   the directory containing the file you downloaded from online
   services, and &lt;location&gt; is the path to your Windows directory. For
   example, if you are installing from a floppy disk that you inserted
   in drive A, and C:\WINDOWS is the path to your Windows directory,
   type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\calc.exe c:\windows
</PRE><P>
   Or, for example, if you downloaded the WW1138.EXE file from online
   services to C:\DOWNLOAD and C:WINDOWS is the path to your Windows
   directory, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\download\calc.exe c:\windows
</PRE><P>
   You are now ready to restart Windows (if necessary) and run the
   updated Calculator accessory.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem Using Previous Versions of Calculator</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>To perform this test, choose two numbers that include values to the
   right of the decimal point (for example, 12.52 and 12.51).

<P><LI>Double-click the Calculator icon in the Accessories group.

<P><LI>Enter the larger number first (for example, 12.52).

<P><LI>Press the MINUS SIGN (-).

<P><LI>Enter the smaller number (for example, 12.51).

<P><LI>Press the EQUAL SIGN (=).
<P>
</OL>Note that in this example you do not receive .01, the expected result.
Instead, you receive one of the following:
<P>
<PRE>   0.00
   0.0099999999
   0.010000001

</PRE></OL>The updated Calculator accessory displays the correct result, which is
.01.
