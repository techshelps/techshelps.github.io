The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Workgroup Connections version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, version 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
On a machine running Workgroup Connections, Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS,
or Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 6118: The list of servers for this workgroup is not currently
   available.

</PRE>Under Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you may also receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   The list of servers for this workgroup is not currently available.

</PRE>In this case, you can see the workgroup but not the individual computers in
the workgroup. You may be able to see the computers under other workgroups.
You can connect to a server by manually typing in the path, but you cannot
browse a list of available servers.
<P>
Or, other computers are able to browse the network but not all workstations
show up on the browse list.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors can occur if you browse or run NET VIEW when connecting to
network drives and one of the following conditions exists:

<UL><LI>Your machine has file and print sharing disabled (Windows for Workgroups
   only).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>There is a space character in the workgroup name.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>There are no browse master machines on the network (Windows for
   Workgroups only).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You are using the Windows for Workgroups basic redirector and you
   have ten network connections established.
<P>
</UL>If there is no master or backup browser present in the workgroup, you
cannot see individual computers in a workgroup when you browse. You may see
the computers in other workgroups if there is a browser present in that
workgroup. If there is only one workgroup present on the network and there
is no browser present, you see the workgroup listed but no servers.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<UL><LI>Enable file and/or print sharing.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Remove the space character from the workgroup name.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      net view /workgroup:"work group"
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The quotation marks are not optional.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use a text editor (such as MS-DOS Editor or Windows for Workgroups
   Notepad) to edit the SYSTEM.INI file on one machine in the workgroup and
   add the following entry to the [Network] section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MaintainServerList=yes
</PRE><P>
   You can also set a second computer in the workgroup to Auto and the
   remainder at "no." On each computer that you edit the SYSTEM.INI file,
   you must quit and restart Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Disconnect from one or more network servers.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MaintainServerList controls the ability of the computer to act as a browse
master. If this entry is set to Auto, the computer acts as a backup browser
or master browser as needed. If the entry is set to Yes, the computer acts
as the master browser. If the entry is set to No, the computer acts as
neither. There must be at least one computer acting as a browser in the
workgroup in order for you to be able to browse.
