1. Q. What is the most common reason for unsuccessful installation
      of Microsoft Windows?

   A. Terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs loaded from the
      CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files are the most common cause of
      unsuccessful Windows installations. If you are having difficulty
      with Windows Setup, insert a system disk in your floppy disk
      drive and restart your computer. The system disk should contain
      CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files without any device drivers or
      TSR programs loaded, unless such items are needed to access the
      hard disk drive. If you use any special drivers for your hard
      disk drive, such as Disk Manager or Stacker(TM), make sure the
      drivers are in your new CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and
      also on the system disk.

2. Q. When Windows Setup attempts to switch from the MS-DOS-based
      portion of Setup to the Windows-based portion of the
      installation, the hourglass disappears and Setup hangs, or
      Windows exits to MS-DOS. Why is this happening?

   A. Setup may stop responding if a corrupted SETUP.INF or SETUP.EXE
      file or an outdated version of one of these files is located in
      the WINDOWS or WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. Search for SETUP.INF
      and SETUP.EXE in these directories and rename these files if you
      find them. (For example, rename SETUP.INF to SETUP.OLD.) After
      you rename the file or files, run the Windows Setup program
      again from the Windows disks.

3. Q. Setup correctly identifies that I have a Video Seven(TM)
      video card; however, when I switch from the MS-DOS-based portion
      of Setup to the Windows-based portion of Setup, my computer
      hangs. How can I correct this problem?

   A. The video drivers that ship with Windows 3.1 support most Video
      Seven video cards, but not those using the Headland Technology
      Video Seven HT-216 or HT-217 chip sets. If your card uses one of
      these chip sets, select standard VGA, rather than Video Seven,
      during Setup. If you need the additional resolution or color
      drivers for the card, contact Video Seven technical support.
