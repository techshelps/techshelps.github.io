<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information is contained in the Microsoft Windows version 3.0
SYSINI.TXT readme file. The Windows Setup program copies this file to the
Windows 3.0 directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>[386Enh] SECTION</h3>
 
<P>
The [386Enh] section contains information specific to running Windows
in 386 enhanced mode, including information used for virtual-memory
page swapping.
<P>
The [386Enh] section can contain the following settings:
<P>
 
AllVMsExclusive=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: false
Purpose: If enabled, this setting forces all applications to run in
<PRE>         exclusive mode, overriding all contrary settings in the
         applications' program information files (PIFs). Enabling this
         setting might prolong the life of network and memory-resident
         software that is incompatible with Windows.
</PRE>Can change by: Using Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
AltPasteDelay=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default: .025
Purpose: Specifies how much time Windows waits before pasting any
<PRE>         characters after the ALT key has been pasted. Some
         applications may require more time for recognition of the ALT
         keystroke.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
CGANoSnow=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: If enabled, causes Windows to do special handling to avoid
<PRE>         snow appearing on an IBM CGA display device.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
COM1AutoAssign=&lt;number&gt;
COM2AutoAssign=&lt;number&gt;
COM3AutoAssign=&lt;number&gt;
COM4AutoAssign=&lt;number&gt;
Default: 2
Purpose: Indicate the contention detection values for each connected
<PRE>         communications port. These values are used by Windows to
         determine how to arbitrate requests for the use of a device
         by more than one application, at least one of which is a
         non-Windows application. If the value is -1, Windows will
         display a warning message that asks the user which
         application should be given control of the port. If the value
         is zero, any application can use the device at any time. If
         the value is a positive integer less than 1,000, this value
         represents the number of seconds after an application stops
         using the device before another application can use the same
         device.
</PRE><h3>To change: Choose the 386 Enhanced icon from the Control Panel window.</h3>
 
COM1Base=&lt;port&gt;
COM2Base=&lt;port&gt;
COM3Base=&lt;port&gt;
COM4Base=&lt;port&gt;
Default: See purpose.
Purpose: Specifies the base (first) port for the serial port adapter
<PRE>         you are using. The default values are as follows:

          Port       Default
          ----       -------
          COM1        3F8h
          COM2        2F8h
          COM3        3E8h
          COM4        2E8h

         Check your hardware documentation for the appropriate value.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
COMBoostTime=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
Default: 2
Purpose: Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to allow a
<PRE>         virtual machine to process a COM interrupt. If an
         communications application is losing keyboard characters on
         the display, you can try increasing this value.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
COM1Irq=&lt;number&gt;
COM2Irq=&lt;number&gt;
COM3Irq=&lt;number&gt;
COM4Irq=&lt;number&gt;
Default: See purpose.
Purpose: Specifies which interrupt line is being used by the device on
<PRE>         the specified communications port. The default values are as
         follows:

          Port       Default
          ----       -------
          COM1          4
          COM2          3
          COM3          4
          COM4          3

         Check your hardware documentation for the appropriate value.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
Device=&lt;filename-or-*devicename&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies which virtual devices are being used with Windows
<PRE>         in 386 enhanced mode. This value can appear two ways: either
         the filename of a specific device driver, or an asterisk (*)
         followed immediately by the device name. The latter case
         refers to a virtual device that is in the WIN386.EXE file.
         Synonyms for device= are display=, keyboard=, network= and
         mouse=. Multiple device settings are required to run Windows
         in 386 enhanced mode.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
Display=&lt;filename&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies the display device that is being used with Windows
<PRE>         in 386 enhanced mode. This setting is a synonym to device=
         and exists to tell Setup which display device driver you are
         using.
</PRE>To change: Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main Group window.
 
DMABufferIn1MB=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: Indicates, if enabled, that the DMA buffer memory should be
<PRE>         in the first 1 MB of memory in order to be compatible with
         8-bit bus master cards.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
DMABufferSize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 16
Purpose: Specifies the amount of memory to be reserved for buffered
<PRE>         direct memory access (DMA). Windows in 386 enhanced mode will
         default to a DMA buffer size that will handle disk access.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
DualDisplay=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: See purpose.
Purpose: Normally, when running in 386 enhanced mode, the memory
<PRE>         between B000:0000 and B7FF:FFFF will be used by the general
         system unless a secondary display is detected. If this
         setting is enabled, this memory will be left unused and
         available for display adapters. If this setting is disabled,
         the address range will available on EGA systems but not under
         VGA systems, since the VGA display device supports monochrome
         modes, which use this address space.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
EMMExclude=&lt;range&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies a range of memory that Windows will not consider
<PRE>         using as an EMM page. This has the side effect of turning off
         the RAM and ROM search code for the range. The range (two
         paragraph values separated by a hyphen) must be between C000
         and EFFF. Windows normally scans this area to find unused
         address space. This scanning can interfere with some adapters
         that use the same memory area. Values are rounded to a
         multiple of 16K. For example, you could set
         EMMExclude=C800-CFFF to prevent Windows from scanning the
         addresses C800:0000 through CFFF:FFFF. You may specify
         multiple memory ranges by using this setting more than once.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
EMMInclude=&lt;range&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies a range of memory that Windows will consider using
<PRE>         as an EMM page regardless of what may be there. EMMInclude
         takes precedence over EMMExclude if you specify ranges that
         overlap. The range (two values separated by a hyphen) must be
         between C000 and EFFF. Values are rounded to the nearest 16K.
         You may specify multiple memory ranges by using this setting
         more than once.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
EMMPageFrame=&lt;address&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies the starting address where the 64K page frame will
<PRE>         begin only when Windows in 386 enhanced mode cannot find a
         suitable page frame. Allows an EMM page frame in an area
         containing some unused RAM or ROM.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
EMMSize=&lt;number-or-kilobytes&gt;
Default: -1
Purpose: Specifies the total amount of memory to be made available for
<PRE>         mapping as expanded memory. The default allows all system
         memory to be allocated as EMM. You should specify a value for
         this setting if you run an application that allocates all of
         the available expanded memory. This will be apparent if, when
         you run the application, you can never create any new virtual
         machine. If this value is zero, then no expanded memory will
         be allocated, but the EMM driver will be loaded.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
FileSysChange=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: yes
Purpose: Indicates whether File Manager will automatically receive
<PRE>         messages anytime a non-Windows application creates, renames,
         or deletes a file. By disabling this setting , a virtual
         machine can be run exclusively even when it manipulates
         files.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
global=&lt;device-name&gt;
Default: (all devices)
Purpose: Used to define DOS devices loaded in CONFIG.SYS that need to
<PRE>         be global to the system. The default setting for all devices
         is global. But certain virtual devices might specify that a
         DOS device be local (for example, MS$MOUSE). Use this setting
         to override that local specification.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
HighFloppyReads=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: yes
Purpose: Normally, Windows turns a DMA verify to the area
<PRE>         E000:0000-EFFF:FFFF into a read. In rare cases, this might
         cause the system to fail because some software might, as a
         result, write over the system's shadow RAM if you have it in
         this area. If this happens, disable this setting and set
         EMMExclude to E000-EFFF.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
IgnoreInstalledEMM=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: Enabling this setting allows Windows to start in 386 enhanced
<PRE>         mode even when there is an unknown expanded memory manager
         (EMM) running. This can cause the system to fail if
         memory-resident software was using EMM before Windows
         started. Enable this setting only if no such software is
         installed or you are sure it will not be active when you are
         running Windows. Note: This only applies to expanded memory
         managers servicing physical EMS hardware; Windows will not
         disable 80386 expanded memory emulators.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
InDOSPolling=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: Some memory-resident software needs to be in a critical
<PRE>         section to do operations off an INT21 hook. Enabling this
         setting assures that this will happen by preventing Windows
         from running other virtual machines when the memory-resident
         software has the InDOS flag set.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
IRQ9Global=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: If enabled, this setting converts IRQ9 masks to global.
<PRE>         Enable if you are using software that leaves IRQ9 masks,
         therefore hanging the system.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
Keyboard=&lt;filename&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Tells Setup which keyboard driver is being used with Windows
<PRE>         in 386 enhanced mode. This is a synonym to device=.
</PRE>To change: Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main Group window.
 
KeyBoostTime=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default: .001
Purpose: Specifies the amount of time an application gets to run with
<PRE>         increased priority when it receives a keystroke. This setting
         can used to increase the response to keystrokes when several
         background applications are running.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
KeyBufferDelay=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default: .2
Purpose: Specifies the amount of time to delay processing keyboard
<PRE>         input after the keyboard buffer is full. Some applications
         may require a larger value than the default.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
KeyPasteDelay=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default: .003
Purpose: Specifies how much time to wait before pasting any characters
<PRE>         after a key has been pasted. Some applications may require
         more time than the default for recognition of a keystroke.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
KeyPasteTimeout=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default: 1
Purpose: Specifies how much time to allow an application to make the
<PRE>         necessary BIOS calls after it reads keyboard input before
         Windows will setting from fast paste to slow paste keyboard
         input.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
Local=&lt;device-name&gt;
Default: CON
Purpose: Used to define device drivers that need to be local to each
<PRE>         virtual machine. This means a separate copy of the driver
         will exist in each virtual machine, and each will keep
         different state information. Most device drivers will not
         function properly when this setting is used. An exception is
         CON, the DOS console device, which should be local to avoid
         filling a buffer with input from multiple virtual machines.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit SYSTEM.INI file.
 
LPT1AutoAssign=&lt;integer&gt;
LPT2AutoAssign=&lt;integer&gt;
LPT3AutoAssign=&lt;integer&gt;
LPT4AutoAssign=&lt;integer&gt;
Default: 60
Purpose: Indicates the contention detection value for each connected
<PRE>         port. These values are used by Windows to determine how to
         arbitrate requests for the use of a device by more than one
         application, at least one of which is a non-Windows
         application. If the value is -1, Windows will display a
         warning message that asks the user which application should
         be given control of the port. If the value is 0, any
         application can use the device at any time. If the value is a
         positive integer less than 1,000, this value represents the
         number of seconds after an application stops using the device
         before another application can use the same device.
</PRE><h3>To change: Choose the 386 Enhanced icon from the Control Panel window.</h3>
 
MapLargeNetTransfers=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: false
Purpose: Indicates whether to map a NetBIOS request when there is not
<PRE>         enough buffer space to buffer it. Setting this setting to
         true may be useful if you do not want to use a lot of memory
         for buffers when running a network application that does
         large data transfers.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
MapPhysAddress=&lt;range&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies the address range (in MB) in which the memory
<PRE>         manager will preallocate physical mappings. Use this setting
         if you are using a DOS device driver (such as an older
         version of RAMDrive that uses extended memory) that uses the
         INT15 MOVEBLOCK service to access memory allocated before
         Windows in 386 enhanced mode is started. Otherwise, if no
         memory is available, the MOVEBLOCK call may not be made.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
MaxPagingFileSize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies the maximum size for a temporary swap file.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
MinTimeSlice=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
Default: 20
Purpose: Specifies the minimum amount of time a virtual machine will
<PRE>         be allowed to run before other virtual machines may take
         over. A smaller value (such as 1 millisecond) will make
         multitasking appear smoother, but will diminish the overall
         system performance.
</PRE><h3>To change: Choose the 386 Enhanced icon from the Control Panel window.</h3>
 
MinUserDiskSpace=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 500
Purpose: Tells Windows how much disk space to leave free when creating
<PRE>         a temporary swap file. You would want to use this setting if
         your system's paging drive has less available space than
         Windows can use for paging. This setting has no effect if a
         permanent swap file exists.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
Mouse=&lt;filename&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies the virtual device that handles the mouse hardware
<PRE>         in 386 enhanced mode. This setting is a synonym for device=.
</PRE>To change: Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main Group window.
 
NetAsynchFallback=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: false
Purpose: When an application issues an asynchronous NetBIOS request,
<PRE>         Windows will attempt to allocate space in its global network
         buffer to receive the data. If there is insufficient space in
         the global buffer, Windows will normally fail the NetBIOS
         request. If this setting is enabled, Windows will attempt to
         save such a request by allocating a buffer in local memory
         and preventing any other VMs from running until the data is
         received and the timeout period (defined by NetAsynchTimeout)
         expires.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
NetAsynchTimeout=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default: 5.0
Purpose: Specifies the timeout period (in seconds) when Windows needs
<PRE>         to enter a critical section in order to service an
         asynchronous NetBIOS request. It is used only when
         NetAsynchFallback is enabled. This value can include a
         decimal (such as 0.5).
</PRE> 
NetDMASize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 32 on Micro Channel machines
<PRE>         0 on non-Micro Channel machines
</PRE>Purpose: Specifies the DMA buffer size for NetBIOS transport software
<PRE>         if a network has been installed. In this case, the buffer
         size is the larger value between this value and the value of
         DMABufferSize.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
NetHeapSize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 12
Purpose: Specifies the size of the buffers that Windows in 386
<PRE>         enhanced mode allocates in conventional memory for
         transferring data over a network. All values are rounded up
         to the nearest 4K.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
Network=&lt;filename&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Tells Setup which type of network you are using. This setting
<PRE>         is a synonym for device=.
</PRE>To change: Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main Group window.
 
NMIReboot=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: If enabled, causes a reboot to occur when an NMI interrupt is
<PRE>         received.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
NoEMMDriver=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: false
Purpose: Causes Windows in 386 enhanced mode to not install its
<PRE>         expanded memory driver. This differs from setting EMMSize to
         zero, which does not prevent the EMM driver from being
         loaded.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
Paging=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: yes
Purpose: Enables or disables demand paging (virtual memory). You would
<PRE>         disable this setting only if you need the disk space normally
         used for a temporary swap file.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
PagingDrive=&lt;drive-letter&gt;
Default: (current drive)
Purpose: Specifies the disk drive where Windows in 386 enhanced mode
<PRE>         will allocate a temporary swap file. If the current drive is
         a network drive, the swap file will be created on the same
         drive as the SYSTEM.INI file. If both are network drives,
         paging will be disabled.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
ReflectDosInt2A=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: false
Purpose: Indicates whether Windows should consume or reflect DOS INT
<PRE>         2A signals. The default means Windows will consume these
         signals and therefore run more efficiently.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
ReservePageFrame=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: true
Purpose: Tells Windows whether to use up EMS page frame space when it
<PRE>         allocates DOS transfer buffers below 640K. Leaving this
         setting disabled gives a non-Windows application more memory
         at the expense of EMS page frame space. Enable this setting
         only for an application that uses an EMS page frame.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
SGrabLPT=&lt;port-number&gt;
Default: (current virtual machine)
Purpose: Routes all printer input on the specified port to the system
<PRE>         virtual machine rather than the current virtual machine.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
SystemRomBreakPoint=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: true
Purpose: Windows in 386 enhanced mode normally searches the ROM
<PRE>         address space between F000 and 1 MB to find a special
         instruction that is used as a system break point. If this
         address space contains something other than permanently
         available ROM, you should disable this setting so that
         Windows will not use this space for a break point.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
SystemVMPriority=&lt;number,number&gt;
Default: 100,50
Purpose: This setting contains two numbers. The first number specifies
<PRE>         the relative amount of processing time (based on the
         MinTimeSlice setting) given to all Windows applications
         running in the foreground relative to the time allocated to
         all non-Windows applications running in the background. The
         second number specifies the relative amount of processing
         time given to all Windows applications running in the
         background when a non-Windows application is running in the
         foreground. The range of numbers that can be entered is 1
         through 10000. The important value is the ratio of these
         settings to the corresponding settings in the program
         information files (PIFs) of the active non-Windows
         applications.
</PRE><h3>To change: Choose the 386 Enhanced icon from the Control Panel window.</h3>
 
SysVMemsLimit=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 0
Purpose: Specifies how many kilobytes of expanded memory Windows
<PRE>         should be permitted to use. Leave this setting at zero to
         prevent Windows from gaining access to any expanded memory.
         Set it to -1 to give Windows all the available expanded
         memory that it requests.
</PRE>To change: Choose the PIF Editor icon from the Accessories Group
<PRE>         window.
</PRE> 
SysVMemsLocked=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: Indicates whether to swap Windows' expanded memory to the
<PRE>         hard disk. Locking EMS memory can improve Windows
         performance, but it slows down the rest of the system.
</PRE>To change: Choose the PIF Editor icon from the Accessories Group
<PRE>         window.
</PRE> 
SysVMemsRequired=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 0
Purpose: Specifies how many kilobytes of expanded memory must be free
<PRE>         in order to start Windows. Leave this setting at zero if no
         Windows application uses expanded memory.
</PRE>To change: Choose the PIF Editor icon from the Accessories Group
<PRE>         window.
</PRE> 
SysVMExclusive=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: Indicates whether Windows always gets all of the computer's
<PRE>         processing time whenever a Windows application is active. If
         this setting is enabled and a Windows application is in the
         foreground, no non-Windows applications will run.
</PRE><h3>To change: Choose the 386 Enhanced icon from the Control Panel window.</h3>
 
SysVMKBDesired=&lt;number-or-kilobytes&gt;
Default: -1
Purpose: Limits the amount of conventional memory Windows can use for
<PRE>         itself. The default value indicates that Windows can use as
         much of this space as it needs. You can try entering a
         positive value if there is not enough memory to run Windows
         in 386 enhanced mode.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
SysVMKBRequired=&lt;number-or-kilobytes&gt;
Default: 256
Purpose: Specifies how much conventional memory (in KB) must be free
<PRE>         in order to start Windows. Setting this setting to -1 gives
         Windows all available conventional memory.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
SysVMV86Locked=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: false
Purpose: Enabling this setting will cause the virtual-mode memory
<PRE>         being used in the system VM to remain locked in memory rather
         that being swappable out to disk. Because Windows handles
         this process, there is no known reason to enable this
         setting.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
SysVMxmsLimit=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 0
Purpose: Specifies the maximum amount of memory the XMS driver will
<PRE>         allocate to DOS device drivers and memory-resident software
         in the system virtual machine. Set to -1 to give an
         application all the available extended memory that it
         requests.
</PRE>To change: Choose the PIF Editor icon from the Accessories Group
<PRE>         window.
</PRE> 
SysVMxmsLocked=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: Indicates whether to swap the memory allocated by the XMS
<PRE>         driver to the hard disk. Locking the XMS memory can improve
         an application's performance, but it slows down the rest of
         the system.
</PRE>To change: Choose the PIF Editor icon from the Accessories Group
<PRE>         window.
</PRE> 
SysVMxmsRequired=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 0
Purpose: Specifies how many kilobytes of extended memory must be
<PRE>         reserved by the XMS driver in order to start Windows. Leave
         this setting at zero if there are no XMS users in the system
         virtual machine.
</PRE>To change: Choose the PIF Editor icon from the Accessories Group
<PRE>         window.
</PRE> 
TokenRingSearch=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: true
Purpose: Tells Windows whether to search for a token ring network
<PRE>         adapter on AT architecture machines. Disable this setting if
         you are not using a token ring card and the search disables
         another device.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
TranslateScans=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: Indicates whether Windows will translate a keyboard's scan
<PRE>         codes to make them compatible with standard IBM scan codes.
         This setting is necessary only for keyboards that generate
         non-standard scan codes. This setting is used only for the
         Switcher Screen and message boxes.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
TrapFloppyFIFO=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: on for Micro Channel machines
<PRE>         off for other machines
</PRE>Purpose: Indicates whether to enable port trapping in the VFD. When
<PRE>         trapping is enabled, the FIFO is never enabled. FIFO can
         interfere with DMA. Normally, you should disable this setting
         if there is a port conflict (port is 03F3h).
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
UniqueDOSPSP=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: false
Purpose: If enabled, this setting tells Windows in 386 enhanced mode
<PRE>         to reserve some paragraphs of memory in each virtual machine
         (VM) prior to starting an application in the VM. This will
         usually ensure that each application has a unique PSP
         (loading address). Some networks use the PSP to identify a
         process to make sure that two processes do not try to modify
         a file at the same time. On such networks, running with this
         setting disabled may result in corrupted files. However,
         enabling this setting will take memory away from each
         application.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
UseInstFile=&lt;filename&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies a data file that the DOS Manager device (DOSMGR)
<PRE>         should use to determine whether data structures within DOS
         need to be local. There are two other methods to do this:
         internal tables within the device, and an INT 2fh call
         documented in the OEM Adaptation Kit. Both methods are
         preferred to using this setting; it is provided only for
         compatibility with Windows/386 Version 2.x.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
VirtualHDIrq=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: on
Purpose: Allows Windows in 386 enhanced mode to terminate interrupts
<PRE>         from hard disk controller, bypassing the ROM routine that
         handles these interrupts. Some hard drives might require that
         this setting be disabled in order for interrupts to be
         processed correctly. If this setting is disabled, the ROM
         routine handles the interrupts, which slows the system's
         performance.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
 
WindowUpdateTime=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
Default: 50
Purpose: Specifies the amount of time Windows takes between updates of
<PRE>         the display for a windowed non-Windows application.
</PRE>To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
