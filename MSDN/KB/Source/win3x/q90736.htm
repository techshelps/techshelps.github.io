<PRE>                 WINDOWS DRIVER LIBRARY CHANGE LOG
                 =================================

</PRE>**********************************************************************
<PRE>*                              AUDIO                                 *
</PRE>**********************************************************************
<P>
<P><h3>Artisoft Sounding Board Driver (ARTIS.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
06/19/92 - The Artisoft Sounding Board driver has been updated to
<PRE>           provide improved performance and quality. It is recommended
           that you upgrade your driver if you are using previously
           released versions of this driver.

           A message was added to the self-extracting .EXE file to
           remind customers NOT to run the .EXE file in the Windows
           directory or the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. A new license
           agreement is also included.

</PRE><h3>Creative Sound Blaster Pro/Pro Basic (CREAT.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
08/19/93 - CREAT.EXE has been deleted from the WDL.
<P>
06/19/92 - THE DRIVERS HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGED.
<P>
<PRE>           A message was added to the self-extracting .EXE file to
           remind customers NOT to run the .EXE file in the Windows
           directory or the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. A new license
           agreement is also included.

</PRE>06/02/92 - No changes were made to any of the Creative Sound Blaster
<PRE>           Pro drivers. The only change occurred in CREATIVE.TXT.

</PRE>05/28/92 - The drivers in CREAT.EXE have been updated to be more
<PRE>           stable. The main changes are to MIDI. The Mixer has also
           been improved from the earlier WDL version of this driver. All
           buttons and features, such as Save Settings, now function
           correctly. CREATIVE.TXT includes more information on
           installing and using these drivers.

</PRE><h3>IBM M-Audio Adapter (IBM.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
06/19/92 - THE DRIVERS HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGED.
<P>
<PRE>           A message was added to the self-extracting .EXE file to
           remind customers NOT to run the .EXE file in the Windows
           directory or the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. A new license
           agreement is also included.

</PRE><h3>PC Speaker Driver (SPEAK.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
06/19/92 - THE DRIVERS HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGED.
<P>
<PRE>           A message was added to the self-extracting .EXE file to
           remind customers NOT to run the .EXE file in the Windows
           directory or the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. A new license
           agreement is also included.

</PRE>06/02/92 - This version of SPEAKER.DRV contains a workaround for
<PRE>           machines (specifically AST, but there may be others) that
           implement speaker ports in a nonstandard way. Specifically, both
           PPI bits are now toggled on and off, rather than just the
           speaker bit.

</PRE>05/06/92 - No change was made to the driver or supporting files.
<P>
<PRE>           This file was replaced because a .TXT file needed to be
           changed.

</PRE><h3>Pro AudioSpectrum Audio Adapters (PROAUD.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
05/14/92 - PROAUD.EXE has been removed from the Windows Driver
<PRE>           Library. These drivers have been found to hang systems
           when running multimedia-intensive tasks (for example,
           animation, video, and sound) at the same time.

</PRE><h3>Thunderboard (THUNDR.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
06/19/92 - THE DRIVERS HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGED.
<P>
<PRE>           A message was added to the self-extracting .EXE file to
           remind customers NOT to run the .EXE file in the Windows
           directory or the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. A new license
           agreement is also included.
