<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You are unable to run or install Microsoft Remote Access Services (RAS)
when the Intel CCCOMM.DRV communications driver is running in place of the
Windows COMM.DRV driver.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the installation programs for Intel PCMCIA data and fax modems
disable the Windows COMM.DRV communications driver and install the
proprietary Intel CCCOMM.DRV driver in its place. ("CCC" in the driver
filename stands for credit card communications.)
<P>
The Intel CCCOMM.DRV driver enhances the performance of Intel cards when
you are running the Intel fax software supplied with Intel modems. However,
CCCOMM.DRV is unnecessary for other communications utilities, such as
Windows Terminal, and it actually conflicts with the operation of Microsoft
RAS.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Intel offers an alternative MODEM.INF file that loads the Windows COMM.DRV
file instead of CCCOMM.DRV when you run Microsoft RAS on your Intel PCMCIA
data and fax modems.
<P>
You can obtain the self-expanding MODINF.EXE file from the Intel bulletin
board service (BBS) at (503) 645-6275.
<P>
After you obtain the updated MODEM.INF file, you should follow its
installation instructions precisely. Specifically, you must run the fix in
your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory to replace the original MODEM.INF file.
You should pick only your particular card from the list, which appears in
the RAS Setup Configure dialog box. If you select the incorrect Intel
modem, or if you try to simply replace the CCCOMM.DRV file with COMM.DRV
without obtaining the fix from Intel, a "Serial Communications Overflow"
error occurs when you try to dial from RAS.
<P>
According to Intel technical support, you can find the version number
(called the "order number") for your modem under the support phone number
on the PCMCIA card label. If no order number is printed on the label for
your Intel data and fax 14.4K baud modem, you probably have version 6830;
in this case, select 6830 in the RAS Setup Configuration dialog box.
