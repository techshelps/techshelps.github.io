<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
This article contains information about using Windows for Workgroups
with a third-party product that has not been tested and is not supported
by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for
more information.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Novell NetWare version 3.12 or 4.0x client software to a
shared copy of Windows or Windows for Workgroups, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   NetWare shell incompatible

   Cannot use a device specified in the SYSTEM.INI file. The device
   may be necessary to run Windows in 386 enhanced mode.

   If you experience problems, run the Setup program again.

   C:\WINDOWS\vnetware.386

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Novell NetWare client install for versions 3.12 and 4.0x uses
VLM.EXE in place of NETX.EXE. If you are using VLM.EXE, the Novell
NetWare client software does not properly update a shared copy of
Windows (SETUP /A and SETUP /N); therefore, you must add the new Windows
support files provided by Novell NetWare.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correctly install the NetWare client software to both the shared
copy of Windows on the NetWare server and to all user directories,
perform the steps below.
<P>
NOTE: These steps assume that you have run SETUP /A on the server
and SETUP /N to a user directory that has not been modified by the
NetWare 4.0x client install:

<OL><P><LI>Create an empty subdirectory on the local drive.

<P><LI>Create two blank files in this directory named WIN.INI and
    SYSTEM.INI.

<P><LI>Run the Novell NetWare client install utility. This utility is
    provided by Novell and will add the files needed for Windows.
    During the NetWare client install process, step 3 gives the option
    to install support for Windows and to provide the location of the
    Windows directory. You must choose Yes to install support for Windows,
    and point it to the empty subdirectory created in Step 1.

<P><LI>Once the installation is finished, delete all *.INI files in the
    subdirectory specified in step 1.

<P><LI>Change to the mapped drive and directory in which the shared Windows
    directory (SETUP /A) is located, and remove the read-only attribute
    from all files in the shared Windows directory.

<P><LI>The NetWare client install creates the following two subdirectories
    under the subdirectory created in step 1:
<P>
       NLS and SYSTEM

<P><LI>Copy the files from the SYSTEM subdirectory to the shared Windows
    directory on the NetWare server (where the SETUP /A was installed).
    This should copy the following five files:
<P>
       NETWARE.DRV
       NETWARE.HLP
       VNETWARE.386
       VIPX.386
       NWPOPUP.EXE

<P><LI>Delete these files in the SYSTEM subdirectory and remove the SYSTEM
    subdirectory.

<P><LI>Copy the remaining files in the subdirectory created in step 1, along
    with the entire NLS subdirectory, to the shared Windows directory on
    the NetWare server.

<P><LI>Delete the NLS subdirectory and the subdirectory created in step 1.

<P><LI>You then need to mark all files in the shared Windows directory with
    the read-only attribute. This can be done by typing
<P>
       attrib *.* +r
<P>
    in the subdirectory in which the shared copy of Windows was installed.

<P><LI>Add the following lines to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file
    in the Windows user directory for all workstations that will be running
    either the NetWare 3.12 or 4.0x client:
<P>
      TimerCriticalSection=10000
      ReflectDOSInt2A=TRUE
      UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
      PSPIncrement=5
      OverlappedIO=OFF
<P>
    NOTE: With Windows for Workgroups 3.11, these lines should already
    exist if support for Novell NetWare 4.x was installed during Setup.

<P><LI>You can then run the client install to all other workstations on the
    network running Novell NetWare version 3.12 or 4.0 as needed. When the
    install utility asks if you want to install support for Windows, choose
    No. Each workstation will use the updated Novell files in the shared
    Windows directory.
<P>
    NOTE: Novell NetWare install adds a group to Windows Program
    Manager for the Novell Utilities. If you want to install this group
    after following the above steps, continue with the following steps;
    otherwise, you can stop here.

<P><LI>Copy the NWUTILS.GRP file from the shared Windows directory to each
    Windows user directory on all workstations to which you want to add
    the group.

<P><LI>From each workstation, run Windows.

<P><LI>In Program Manager, choose New from the File menu.

<P><LI>Select the Program Group option button, then choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Description box, type "NetWare" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>In the Group File box, type "NWUTILS.GRP" (without the quotation
    marks).

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The above steps do not work properly with Windows for Workgroups 3.1
because that version does not support connectivity with Novell NetWare
using Novell's ODI specification.
