The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Under Microsoft Windows, increasing free disk space provides additional
storage space for files and additional capacity for running applications.
<P>
The following files can be deleted to free disk space:

<UL><LI>Delete any ~xxxxxxx.TMP files that remain in the \TEMP directory
   when Windows is not running.

<LI>Delete any files that start with the characters ~WOA.

<LI>Delete the file WIN386.SWP from the \WINDOWS directory if it
   remains when Windows is not running.

<LI>Delete the permanent swap file.

<LI>Delete optional files from the Windows directory.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following text provides more detailed information.

<UL><LI>When Windows is not running, delete any ~xxxxxxx.TMP files that remain
   in the \TEMP directory.
<P>
   This directory is defined as an environment variable in your
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file. To identify the \TEMP directory location, type
   "SET" (without quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt.
   Windows and applications for Windows use the \TEMP directory to
   save temporary work files to the disk. Untracked files hurt the
   performance of some applications for Windows, particularly when
   they are attempting to print.

<LI>Delete any files that start with the characters ~WOA.
<P>
   These files are Windows application swap files. Windows deletes
   application swap files when you exit the associated application.
   However, these files may remain on your hard disk if Windows
   terminates unexpectedly. You can safely delete application swap
   files if Windows is not currently running.

<LI>Delete the file WIN386.SWP from the Windows directory if it
   remains when Windows is not running.
<P>
   WIN386.SWP is the temporary swap file used by Windows in 386
   enhanced mode when a permanent swap file does not exist. Windows
   creates WIN386.SWP when started and then deletes it upon exiting.
   If Windows terminates unexpectedly, it is possible that Windows
   will never have the opportunity to delete WIN386.SWP. You can
   recover room on your hard disk by manually removing this file from
   your Windows directory. CAUTION: The WIN386.SWP file should ONLY
   be removed if it exists on your disk when you are NOT running
   Windows. If you delete WIN386.SWP in the middle of a Windows
   session and Windows is attempting to use a temporary swap file, its
   removal causes your machine to hang.
<P>
   NOTE: Do NOT delete files named 386SPART.PAR or SPART.PAR. Together
   these two files constitute a permanent swap file, and they should
   not be manually removed.

<LI>Delete the permanent swap file. Do not manually delete this file.
   Instead, follow the appropriate procedure listed below.
<P>
   Windows 3.0 and 3.0a

<P><PRE>      marks at the MS-DOS command prompt).

<P>
   c. In the Command Line box, type "swapfile" (without quotation marks).

   list provides more information on files that Windows loads but are
   not essential to its operation:
