The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Sun Microsystems has announced that version 5.0 of its PC-NFS network
operating system software supports connectivity with Microsoft Windows
for Workgroups (WFWG) version 3.1. This article describes how to set
up PC-NFS with Windows for Workgroups. This procedure is designed for
use with PC-NFS version 5.0 only; previous versions of PC-NFS are not
compatible with Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
Microsoft will assist in the installation of PC-NFS with Windows
for Workgroups. Sun Microsystems is responsible for supporting the
installation, configuration, and use of PC-NFS. Customers who have
issues that cannot be resolved with standard network troubleshooting
should contact Sun Microsystems for assistance.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installing WFWG and PC-NFS Version 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
To use PC-NFS version 5.0 with Windows for Workgroups version 3.1, you
must use the updated WFWNET.DRV driver included with PC-NFS. To update
the driver, simply delete the current version located in your
WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory, and replace it with the current version.
<P>
To install and provide connectivity to PC-NFS and Windows for
Workgroups, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Install Windows for Workgroups version 3.1.

<P><LI>Run the PC-NFS Install program, and select NDIS as the network
   adapter.

<P><LI>Run the QuickNDIS utility, and configure it for Windows for
   Workgroups.

<P><LI>Run the Winstall program.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: For further information about installing and configuring PC-NFS,
refer to your PC-NFS documentation.
<P>
The installation program for Sun PC-NFS makes changes to the
AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, PROTOCOL.INI, and SYSTEM.INI files. These
changes are documented in your PC-NFS installation guide.
<P>
AUTOEXEC.BAT
<P>
The following lines are added to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, but the SET
statements vary with each installation:
<P>
<PRE>   Set TZ=EST5EDT
   Set NFSDRIVE=C
   Set NFSPATH=C:\NFS
   Set TN_DIR=C:\NFS\TELNET
   C:\NFS\PRT *
   C:\NFS\NET INIT
   C:\NFS\RTM

</PRE></OL>CONFIG.SYS
<P>
The following lines are added to the CONFIG.SYS file after the device
drivers installed by Windows for Workgroups. The lines should appear
in this order:
<P>
<PRE>   Device=C:\NFS-NDIS.SYS
   Device=C:\NFS\PCNFS.SYS
   Device=C:\NFS\SOCKDRV.SYS

</PRE>PROTOCOL.INI
<P>
The following section is added to the PROTOCOL.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   [NFS-NDIS]
   DriverName=NFSLINK$
   Bindings=MS$ELNKII


</PRE>SYSTEM.INI
<P>
The following lines are added to the identified sections of the
SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   [Boot]
   secondnet.drv=pcnfs.drv

   [386Enh]
   secondnet=pcnfs.386

</PRE><h3>WFWG and Previous Versions of PC-NFS</h3>
 
<P>
If you install Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 on a network running
a version of PC-NFS earlier than version 5.0, Windows for Workgroups
does not display a warning that this version of PC-NFS is not
supported. (Normally, Windows for Workgroups issues a warning during
setup if the currently installed networking software is not compatible
with Windows for Workgroups.)
<P>
Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 Setup does not have the ability to
detect the presence of a PC-NFS network.
<P>
To run Windows for Workgroups properly on a Sun PC-NFS workstation,
you must either update your PC-NFS software to version 5.0 or remove
all references to PC-NFS connectivity from the CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT files. If you don't remove the references to the Sun
client software before rebooting, the system may stop responding
(hang) as the conflicting network device drivers attempt to load.
<P>
The products included here are manufactured by Sun Microsystems, a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
