<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains common questions and answers regarding the
differences between Windows 3.1 and Windows 3.11. The answers cover why
Microsoft released Windows 3.11, who can benefit from it, what files
changed, and issues with OS/2 for Windows.
<P>
This article is a reprint of the Windows 3.11 Q&amp;A document written by
Product Management and made available on the online services. This
article is reproduced in the Knowledge Base for reference only.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>What is Windows 3.11? How is it different from Windows 3.1?
<P>
   Microsoft Windows 3.11 is a "refresh" release that implements
   packaging changes designed to reduce counterfeiting. The release
   also includes some updated device drivers and a few bug fixes to
   address issues such as diskless workstation support.

<P><LI>Why were these changes made?
<P>
   It's been nearly two years since Windows 3.1 was introduced to the
   market. These new drivers and bug fixes will improve the experience of a
   customer buying Windows for the first time. Also, these changes had
   already been incorporated in our Windows for Workgroups 3.11 release.

<P><LI>Who should update to Windows 3.11?
<P>
   There is no new functionality in the 3.11 release of Windows and all of
   the drivers being added or refreshed have been available on the Windows
   Driver Library and Microsoft's Download Service. So unless a customer is
   having a problem related to one of the areas covered by the fixes
   detailed below, there should be no need for them to update to this
   release. If a customer does need to update they should call Microsoft at
   800) 871-3270 for more information.

<P><LI>What is the difference between Windows 3.11 and Windows for
   Workgroups 3.11.
<P>
   Windows 3.11: Windows 3.11 is simply Windows 3.1 plus the additional
   video and printer drivers and the five bug fixes described below. As
   mentioned above, there is no new functionality or performance
   improvements, features, etc.
<P>
   Windows for Workgroups 3.11: WFW 3.11 offers a number of enhancements
   to our Windows 3.1 product. WFW 3.11 includes enhanced performance,
   from 50-150% faster disk I/O and up to 100% faster network access. It
   also includes integrated networking, Microsoft Mail, Microsoft
   Schedule+, Microsoft At Work PC Fax, and Microsoft's Remote Access
   Services, and a number of other enhancements for both standalone and
   networked Windows PCs.

<P><LI>Does Win 3.11 work with OS/2 for Windows?
<P>
   No it does not. From what we have been able to learn without the
   benefit of source code, which IBM refused to provide Microsoft, OS/2
   for Windows patches Windows in memory at fixed address locations. Such
   a design makes OS/2 for Windows extremely fragile because it depends on
   Windows code being frozen over time.
<P>
   Microsoft encourages developers to write well-behaved Windows
   applications using documented application program interface (API)
   functions and good programming practices. By establishing these
   ground rules we can move the platform forward and maintain support for
   these applications. Windows 3.11 did not break any well-behaved
   applications that we are aware of.
<P>
   Though we regret the inconvenience to customers, IBM has to be
   responsible for writing well-behaved applications -- they have taken
   shortcuts with OS/2 for Windows that have put their customers in a bad
   position. We presume that one or more of the bug fixes incorporated in
   Windows 3.11 (which were included in Windows for Workgroups 3.11
   released November 6, 1993) changed the fixed address locations that are
   patched by OS/2 for Windows. As a result, OS/2 for Windows no longer
   runs correctly.

<P><LI>Did Microsoft do this to thwart IBM?
<P>
   No we did not. We have been talking publicly about this release since
   August of last year -- well before IBM even announced their OS/2 for
   Windows product. Negotiations with Novell and a desire not to interrupt
   the Christmas selling season caused us to delay, but Windows has been on
   the market for nearly two years now and we felt that customers would
   benefit from a refresh of the product.

<P><LI>What should customers do that have purchased OS/2 for Windows and want
   to update to Windows 3.11?
<P>
   IBM has the means at its disposal to permit purchasers of OS/2 for
   Windows to use it with Windows 3.11. First IBM can release a new version
   of OS/2 for Windows that patches Windows 3.11 at the appropriate address
   locations in memory. Second, IBM can provide customers with the KERNEL,
   USER, and GDI modules from Windows 3.1 that do not contain the bug fixes
   which apparently are the source of the problem. Alternatively customers
   can purchase the full OS/2 2.1 product from IBM.

<P><LI>What about customers who buy Windows 3.11 and then want to run OS/2 for
   Windows?
<P>
   We think IBM bears the responsibility for designing OS/2 for Windows in
   such a way that virtually guaranteed it would break if Microsoft made
   any changes in Windows. Nonetheless, in an effort to assist our mutual
   customers, Microsoft will provide purchasers of Windows 3.11 who
   experience difficulty running the product with OS/2 for Windows with
   the unimproved Windows 3.1 files which we modified in Windows 3.11 to
   fix various bugs.  Our Product Support Services will distribute these as
   soon as a diskette can be made available.

<P><LI>What exactly are the code changes made to Win 3.11 and what do they do?
<P>
   First the following drivers have been added or refreshed in the Windows
   3.11 release:
<P>
   - HPLJIV driver
   - 256 Color generic SVGA video driver - which will support TSENG ET4000
<P><PRE>     chip sets and V7, but not ATI Ultra or S3 chip sets.
</PRE>   - As well as the following drivers:
<P>
<PRE>   PSCRIPT.DRV             UNIDRV.DLL
   PSCRIPT.HLP             UNIDRV.HLP
   HPPCL5MS.DRV            HPDSKJET.DRV
   HPPCL5E.DRV             HPPCL.DRV
   HPPCL5E.HLP             PAINTJET.DRV
   HPPCL5E1.DLL            L100_425.WPD
   HPPCL5E2.DLL            L300_471.WPD
   HPPCL5E3.DLL            L300_493.WPD
   HPPCL5E4.DLL            L500_493.WPD
   HPPCL5EO.DLL            L200230&amp;.WPD
   FINSTALL.DLL            L330_52&amp;.WPD
   FINSTALL.HLP            L630_52&amp;.WPD
   EPSON24.DRV             EPSON9.DRV
   V7VDD.386               V7VGA.DRV

</PRE></OL>In addition, the following 5 files were changed:

<UL><LI>KRNL386.EXE: Minimal kernel changes to more gracefully shut down the
   Windows system after installing products which call the ExitWindows API
   to shut Windows down before returning focus to program manager.

<LI>GDI.EXE: Changes which assist ISVs currently writing graphics
   applications, especially those that call the 'draw rectangle function'.
   This will minimize the number of API calls the programmer needs to
   write and maximize the system resources available on the system when
   using graphics intensive applications.

<LI>COMMDLG.DLL: Changes which allow Windows applications on diskless
   workstations to use common dialog boxes. (Formerly available as a PSS
   application note).

<LI>PSCRIPT.DRV and UNIDRV.DLL: These files were updated to eliminate a font
   enumeration conflict that occurred with many word processors when 60 or
   more fonts are used in a single document.

<LI>VTDA.386: The updated VTDA.386 solves a very small percentage of timer-
   related problems that occur when starting an MS-DOS-based application
   under Windows on a Novell NetWare network.
