The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you choose the Novell NetWare option in the Networks dialog box
of Control Panel and you are using an ArcNet network interface card
(NIC), you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The network Novell NetWare cannot be added because Windows for
   Workgroups does not support this network with your ArcNet adapter.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Using an ArcNet NIC to connect to your Novell NetWare network from a
Windows for Workgroups workstation is not supported in the current
version of Windows for Workgroups. This is because Windows for
Workgroups and Novell NetWare handle ArcNet data packets somewhat
differently.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups is implemented to fully support Novell NetWare
connectivity. You can upgrade a Novell NetWare client workstation to a
Windows for Workgroups workstation, or configure a Windows for
Workgroups workstation to access a Novell NetWare server. Windows for
Workgroups supports the Microsoft network transport protocol (NetBEUI)
and the Novell network transport protocol (IPX) on the same network
adapter card by including a Novell-compatible protocol, MSIPX.
<P>
MSIPX supports Token Ring and Ethernet MAC* header formats, but not
token-passing bus network header formats, such as ArcNet. When you use
an ArcNet NIC with Windows for Workgroups, the ArcNet NDIS (MAC-level)
driver emulates Ethernet protocol and uses Ethernet header formats.
That is how Windows for Workgroups recognizes data packets sent along
the ArcNet network.
<P>
NOTE: *MAC is the Media Access Control layer, a sublayer of the
data-link level in the OSI model. The MAC layer communicates directly
with the network adapter card.
<P>
Novell NetWare's IPX protocol handles ArcNet data packets by
"fragmenting" them at the sending end, and then reconstructing them at
the receiver end. NetWare does this because ArcNet protocol creates
packets that are smaller than the minimum size that NetWare protocol
supports.
<P>
The problem occurs when you use an ArcNet card with Windows for
Workgroups over a Novell NetWare network. The Novell network protocol
expects to see a fragmented ArcNet data packet; however, since the
ArcNet NDIS driver encapsulates data packets in an Ethernet-type
header so that Windows for Workgroups can read them, the Novell
NetWare network no longer recognizes them.
