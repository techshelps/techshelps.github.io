<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you use a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Pathworks diskless
workstations, you need to take the additional steps described in this
article when installing Windows version 3.1.
<P>
You need to place loadable drivers provided with Windows 3.1 (for
example, HIMEM.SYS, EMM386.EXE, RAMDRIVE.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, and so
on.) on the boot disk for floppy based systems, or the bootable share
for diskless workstations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
DEC Pathworks handles remote boot stations differently than other
networks. It creates a floppy disk from which to boot. In the case of
an actual floppy-based system, this makes sense; however, on a
diskless workstation, this can be confusing.
<P>
The network creates a bootable disk-service share with the
workstations node address as the name. The boot share is given the
drive letter C by the network. Another share must be created by the
administrator to contain the workstation's Windows directory or any
other applications they may use.
<P>
When the station is set up by the network, the administrator has a
choice of floppy-disk sizes; the largest size for the boot share for a
diskless station is 1.44 MB. In this area, DEC puts a DECNET directory
containing the basic network functions necessary to connect and use
the DECNET master share. Because this does not leave much room for
anything else, The MS-DOS command SETUP /N should be pointed to a
common file service share.
<P>
Another point to remember is that loadable drivers provided by
Windows, HIMEM.SYS, EMM386.EXE, RAMDRIVE.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, and so on,
must be placed on the boot disk for floppy-based systems, or the
bootable share for diskless workstations. This is because the
connection to the main Windows share, or the workstation's Windows
share, is not established until STARTNET.BAT is run in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT.
