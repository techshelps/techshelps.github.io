The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After completing Setup, you receive the following error when attempting
to start Microsoft Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find a device file that may be needed to run Windows in 386
   enhanced mode.

   You need to run the Setup program again.
   Vxxxxxxx.386
   Press a key to continue

</PRE>where Vxxxxxxx.386 is the name of the virtual device driver that Windows
cannot find. After you press a key, the following message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Invalid VxD dynamic link call to device number 000A, service 0007.
   Your Windows configuration is Invalid. Run the Windows Setup
   program again to correct this problem.

</PRE>Device number 000A means that the error was caused by a call to the virtual
display device referenced in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
The missing device is listed in the [386Enh] section in a statement similar
to one of the following:
<P>
<PRE>   display=*VDDVGA

   -or-

   display=Vxxxxxxx.386

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors occur after you upgrade from Windows 3.0 to Windows 3.1.
Windows 3.1 may not always update the valid virtual display driver (VDD)
with the new version from the original Windows 3.1 disks.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps outline the location of the proper virtual display
driver and tell you where it should be located so that Windows can find it.
<P>
NOTE: The following steps apply ONLY to video drivers that are shipped with
Windows 3.1. If a third-party display driver is used, these steps should
still work, but all references to SETUP.INF should be replaced with
OEMSETUP.INF (located on the third-party driver disk) along with the
virtual device driver.

<OL><P><LI>Print or view the SETUP.INF file. The SETUP.INF file is located in
   the Windows\SYSTEM directory. The SETUP.INF file is a text file,
   but it is too large to be edited in Notepad. You can view it in
   Write, but be absolutely sure you select the No Conversion button
   when opening the file so it is not converted to Write's format.

<P><LI>Check the [DISPLAY] section of SETUP.INF for your video mode to
   determine which VDD should be used. (The VDD should either be
   *VDDVGA or Vxxxxxxx.386.)
<P>
   NOTE: The format of the line in SETUP.INF can be found at the
   beginning of the [DISPLAY] section.

<P><LI>If the proper VDD is *VDDVGA, change the display= line in the
   [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file as follows and go to
   step 5.
<P>
<P><PRE>      display=*VDDVGA
</PRE>
<P><LI>If the VDD referenced is Vxxxxxxx.386, you need to expand the
   correct file from the original Windows disks.
<P>
   NOTE: The name of the file is Vxxxxxxx.38_ and you must use the
   EXPAND.EXE program from Windows Disk 3 to expand it. Use the following
   command to expand the file to the Windows\SYSTEM directory (this example
   assumes that your Windows directory is named "WINDOWS":
<P>
<P><PRE>      expand a:vxxxxxxx.38_ c:\windows\system\vxxxxxxx.386
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart Windows.
<P>
</OL>If the procedure above doesn't correct the problem, try expanding the
WIN386.EXE file from your original Windows 3.1 installation disks. If the
WIN386.EXE file on your system is corrupted, it can cause the symptoms
mentioned above.
