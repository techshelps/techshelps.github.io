The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) enables you to connect to and use files,
directories, and printers that are shared on a Microsoft LAN Manager
server. In addition, if you use LAN Manager, you can connect to and
use the resources shared on Windows for Workgroups machines.
<P>
To browse a LAN Manager server appearing in the Windows for Workgroups
Connect Network and Connect Network Printers dialog boxes, at least
one computer on the network must have a Workgroup name that matches
the name of the primary domain of the LAN Manager server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use Control Panel to set options for LAN Manager. Options include logging
onto a LAN Manager domain when logging into Windows for Workgroups, and
changing passwords for various LAN Manager servers and domains. (Logon
scripts run when your LAN Manager password is validated by the logon
server.)
<P>
<P><h3>Setting LAN Manager Options</h3>
 
<P>
To set LAN Manager options, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In the Control Panel window, double-click the Network icon, or use
   the arrow keys to select the Network icon, and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Choose the Networks button.

<P><LI>If Microsoft LAN Manager appears in the Other Networks In Use list,
   select it and then choose the Settings button.
<P>
   If Microsoft LAN Manager is not in the Other Networks In Use list
   select it and then choose the Add button. If a dialog box appears
   asking you to insert a disk, insert the disk and choose the OK button.
   Then choose the Settings button in the Network Settings dialog box.

<P><LI>If you want to log on to a LAN Manager domain when you log on to
   Windows for Workgroups, select the Log On To LAN Manager Domain
   check box and then type the name of the domain you want to log on to
   in the Domain Name box.

<P><LI>If you want to change your passwords for LAN Manager servers or
   domains, choose the Set Password button.

<P><LI>In the LAN Manager Settings dialog box, choose the OK button.

<P><LI>In the Compatible Networks dialog box, choose the OK button.

<P><LI>In the Network Settings dialog box, choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>A message appears prompting you to restart Windows. Choose the Restart
Windows button for your changes to take effect.
<P>
If you select the Log On To LAN Manager Domain option when you start
Windows for Workgroups, a dialog box appears asking you to type your
password for the domain. (You can also specify a different domain to
log on to.) If you do not want to be prompted for your domain password
eac h time you start Windows for Workgroups, select the Save This
Password In Your Password List check box.
<P>
NOTE: You can also use the LMAnnounce= parameter if you have existing
LAN Manager clients that need to see a WFWG server (for example, a
print server) in the server lists under Windows or from the NET VIEW
command.
