<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was taken from the Windows &amp; MS-DOS 5
Upgrade README.WRI file. This article contains sections 9.0 through
12.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>9.0  Using Specific Display Adapters with Windows Version 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
This section describes some problems you might encounter using
specific display adapters or drivers with Windows version 3.1.
<P>
9.1  Installing Display Adapters by Following the Manufacturer's
Instructions
 
<P>
The procedures that are provided by display-adapter manufacturers for
installing display adapters may require you to replace or modify the
SETUP.INF file in the Windows SYSTEM directory. This will cause
problems in Windows version 3.1.
<P>
If your third-party display installation replaces or modifies the
SETUP.INF file, follow these instructions instead to install the
display-adapter drivers:

<OL><P><LI>Rename the SETUP.INF file provided with your display-adapter
   package to OEMSETUP.INF, and place it on the disk and in the
   directory containing the third-party display driver files.

<P><LI>Run Windows Setup from the Main group and select Other Display
   (Requires disk from OEM) from the list of Display options.

<P><LI>Insert the disk that contains the OEMSETUP.INF file and the driver
   files for your display adapter. Or, if these files are located on
   your hard disk, type the path to the directory that contains the
   files in the text box, and then choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Select the type of display adapter you want to use, and then choose
   the OK button.Windows Setup copies all necessary files from the
   driver disk, and may request files from the Setup disks.

<P><LI>Insert any additional disks that are requested, and then choose the
   OK button.
<P>
</OL>If you accidentally overwrite the original SETUP.INF file, you can
copy it from Setup Disk 3 back into your Windows SYSTEM directory.
<P>
<P><h3>9.2  Upgrading Display Drivers When Using Soft-Font Packages</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using certain soft-font packages, including Bitstream
Facelift, Publisher PowerPak, and Hewlett-Packard Intellifont, Windows
Setup may not update your display driver when you upgrade to Windows
version 3.1. In this case, you need to update your display driver
after you have set up Windows. To do this, run Windows Setup from the
Main group, and then select the display driver you want to use from
the list of Display options. For more information about using Setup
after you have installed Windows, see Chapter 15, "Maintaining Windows
with Setup," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>9.3  Using Self-Configuring Display Adapters</h3>
 
<P>
Some display adapters can change their configurations to match what an
application tries to do. For example, if an application tries to use a
video graphics adapter (VGA) configuration and your display adapter is
currently configured as an extended graphics adapter (EGA), the
adapter can switch from an EGA configuration to a VGA configuration.
This type of display adapter makes use of non-maskable interrupts
(NMIs) to change its configuration while you work.
<P>
To use this type of display adapter with Windows running in 386
enhanced mode, you must disable the NMI (also called self-configuring,
auto-switching, or auto-emulating) option. First, configure the
display adapter, and then disable the NMI option. For more
information, see your display-adapter documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>9.4  Hercules Graphics Station</h3>
 
<P>
Hercules Graphics Station adapters are supported by Windows version
3.1 using the TIGA display drivers. If you encounter problems running
Windows in 386 enhanced mode with the Hercules GS, try adding the
following line to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   emmexclude=C000-CFFF

</PRE></OL>For more information about modifying settings in the SYSTEM.INI file,
see the SYSINI.WRI online document.
<P>
<P><h3>9.5  LCD</h3>
 
<P>
If you use an LCD screen, set it for white text on a black background
instead of black text on a white background. When using Windows, black
text on a white background wears out LCD screens. See the
documentation for your screen for instructions on how to do this.
<P>
<P><h3>9.6  Super VGA</h3>
 
<P>
- If you are using a video card and monitor (NEC MultiSync 3D/4D/5D or
<PRE>  other multifrequency monitor) capable of 800x600, 16-color
  resolution with a third-party Super VGA driver, or one of the
  following drivers provided in the Windows 3.0 Supplemental Driver
  Library (SDL):

  - ATI Mode 54h (800x600 16 colors) v2.00
  - CHIPS Super VGA 82C451 (800x600 16 colors)
  - CHIPS Super VGA 82C452 (800x600 16 colors)
  - Paradise VGA (800x600 16 colors)

  use the Super VGA (800x600, 16 colors) driver provided with Windows
  instead. If you do not update your driver, Windows may not work
  properly when running in 386 enhanced mode. In addition, the 3.1
  driver contains new features and performance enhancements.

  To install the Windows version 3.1 Super VGA driver, run Windows
  Setup from the Main group, and then select "Super VGA 800x600, 16
  colors" from the list of Display options. For more information on
  using Setup after you have installed Windows, see Chapter 15,
  "Maintaining Windows with Setup," in the Microsoft Windows User's
  Guide.

</PRE>- Super VGA VESA Mode 6Ah
<P>
<PRE>  Some Super VGA adapters support higher monitor-refresh rates at
  800x600 resolution with a special VESA mode. If both your video
  adapter and monitor support a higher refresh rate and if you are
  using the Super VGA driver, you may be able to get better video
  results by including the following setting in the [display] section
  of the SYSTEM.INI file:

     svgamode=106

  If you encounter problems using this mode, delete this setting from
  the SYSTEM.INI file, and then restart Windows.

</PRE><h3>9.7  Third-Party Display Drivers: Running Non-Windows Applications</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a display driver that is not provided with Windows
version 3.1 and you receive one of the following messages while trying
to run a non-Windows application:
<P>
<PRE>   "Incorrect system version. Run the Windows Setup program again."
       or
   "386 System display type mismatch."

</PRE>contact your display manufacturer for an updated driver. You can also
solve this problem manually by installing 3.0 driver files. These
files are included on the Windows and MS-DOS Setup disks.
<P>
If your display driver works in Windows version 3.0 using the standard
VGA virtual-display-device file (specified by the device=*vddvga
setting in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file), then do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Copy and expand the VDDVGA30.386 file from the Windows and MS-DOS
   Setup disks to your Windows 3.1 SYSTEM directory.

<P><LI>Change the display= setting in the [386Enh] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      display=VDDVGA30.386
</PRE>
<P><LI> Restart Windows.
<P>
</OL>If your display driver works in Windows version 3.0 using the standard
VGA grabber file
(specified by the 386Grabber=VGA.GR3 setting in the [boot] section of
the SYSTEM.INI file),
then do the following:

<OL><P><LI>  Copy and expand the VGA30.3GR file from the Windows and MS-DOS
</OL>Setup disks to your
Windows 3.1 SYSTEM directory.

<OL><P><LI> Change the 386Grabber setting in the [386Enh] section of the
</OL>SYSTEM.INI file to:
386Grabber=VGA30.3GR

<OL><P><LI>  Restart Windows.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>9.8  TIGA</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a Texas Instruments Graphics Architecture (TIGA)-
based display adapter, make sure that you are using a TIGA display
driver that is provided by Windows version 3.1. Windows provides two
versions of the TIGA display driver, "TIGA (Small fonts)" and "TIGA
(Large fonts)."
<P>
To install one of the drivers, run Windows Setup from the Main group,
and then select the version you want from the list of Display options.
For more information on using Setup after you have installed Windows,
see Chapter 15, "Maintaining Windows with Setup," in the Microsoft
Windows User's Guide.
<P>
Note: You cannot use Windows Setup to change TIGA screen resolution.
If you want to change the resolution, you must first quit Windows, and
then use the TIGAMODE utility or another resolution utility supplied
with your display adapter. Unless you want to use a different version
of the TIGA driver (Small fonts or Large fonts) to change font sizes,
it is not necessary to run Windows Setup after changing your TIGA
screen resolution.
<P>
<P><h3>9.9  VGA-Compatible</h3>
 
<P>
Most VGA-compatible display-adapter cards and main-adapter chips use
additional memory to enhance their performance. When Windows is
running in 386 enhanced mode and is configured for VGA, Windows
detects most of these cards and automatically excludes the additional
memory.
<P>
However, if you have an enhanced VGA that Windows does not recognize,
you must exclude the additional memory yourself by adding the
following line to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   emmexclude=C400-C7FF

</PRE></OL>For more information about modifying the SYSTEM.INI file, see the
SYSINI.WRI online document.
<P>
<P><h3>9.10  Video Seven: Using 256-Color Support</h3>
 
<P>
Windows version 3.1 provides 256-color support at several resolutions
for Video Seven display adapters that have at least 512K of video
memory. The following table shows the Video Seven 256-color modes that
are supported by the Video Seven display drivers provided with Windows
version 3.1.
<P>
<PRE>Model               640x480     720x512     800x600     1024x768
FastWrite 512K        Yes
1024i 512K            Yes
VRAM 512K             Yes         Yes
VRAM II 512K          Yes         Yes
VRAM II 1MB           Yes         Yes         Yes          Yes

</PRE>If you are using a Video Seven display adapter that has at least 512K
of video memory, you should use one of the Video Seven display drivers
for 256-color video provided with Windows version 3.1. These drivers
take full advantage of the performance improvements and mouse support
in non-Windows applications. To install one of the drivers, run
Windows Setup from the Main group, and then select the driver you want
from the list of Display options. For more information about using
Setup after you have installed Windows, see Chapter 15, "Maintaining
Windows with Setup," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>9.11  WinSpeed</h3>
 
<P>
The WinSpeed version 1.0 installation program, INSTALL.EXE, does not
work properly with Windows version 3.1. It copies an incompatible
version of the SETUP.INF file to your Windows directory. To install
WinSpeed for use with Windows version 3.1, you must get updated
installation disks from Panacea.
<P>
If you have already used the INSTALL.EXE program to install the
WinSpeed drivers onto your system, the following message will appear
when you try to run Windows Setup from the Main group:
<P>
"The SETUP.INF file on your system is not valid for use with this
version of Setup."
<P>
To correct this problem, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>If there is a SETUP.INF file in your Windows directory, delete it.
   (The SETUP.INF file should never be in your Windows directory.)

<P><LI>Copy the SETUP.INF file on Setup Disk 3 to your Windows SYSTEM
   directory.

<P><LI>Contact Panacea Inc. for updated WinSpeed installation disks that
   are compatible with Windows version 3.1, and then reinstall
   WinSpeed.
<P>
</OL><h3>9.12  IBM XGA: Configuring Color and Resolution</h3>
 
<P>
Windows Setup will automatically configure an IBM XGA for 16-color,
640x480 resolution. If your monitor can support 256 colors or higher
resolutions, you can configure your XGA to use the color and
resolution settings you want. To do this, run Windows Setup from the
Main group, and then select one of the following drivers from the list
of Display options:
<P>
- XGA (640x480, 16 colors)
<P>
<PRE>  This is the default setting and should not be changed if you are
  using the plasma screen on the PS/2 model 75.

</PRE></OL>- XGA (640x480, 256 colors)
- XGA (Small fonts)
- XGA (Large fonts)
<P>
Both the Small and Large fonts settings configure the XGA for 1024x786
resolution and 256 colors, if your monitor supports it. Otherwise
these settings configure your display for 640x480 resolution. Select
Small Fonts if you have a large monitor (at least 16 inches) or want
to fit more information on your screen. Select Large Fonts if you want
to improve the readability of text.
<P>
Make sure that your monitor supports the XGA configuration you select.
If it doesn't, you will be returned to the MS-DOS prompt when you try
to start Windows.
<P>
For more information on using Setup after you have installed Windows,
see Chapter 15, "Maintaining Windows with Setup," in the Microsoft
Windows User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>9.13  IBM XGA: Using EMM386</h3>
 
<P>
To use the IBM XGA successfully with the EMM386 expanded-memory
emulator, you need to manually prevent EMM386 from using the memory
address range used by the XGA display. To do this, include the X=
option on the device=EMM386.EXE line in your CONFIG.SYS file. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>   device=EMM386.EXE  X=C600-C7FF

</PRE>Replace "C600-C7FF" with the correct value for the address range used
by your XGA. To identify this range, run the System Configuration
Program on the System Reference Disk for your Personal System/2
(PS/2), and select "Display Memory Map." A common range is C600-C7FF.
<P>
With some PS/2 model 75 plasma screens or with XGA configured for
640x480 resolution and 16 colors, you must also include the NOEMS or
RAM option on the device=EMM386.EXE line in your CONFIG.SYS file. For
example:
<P>
device=EMM386.EXE NOEMS X=C600-C7FF
<P>
Do not include the i=B000-BE00 option on the device=EMM386.EXE line in
your CONFIG.SYS file. This address range is used by the XGA when
running Windows in 386 enhanced mode. Therefore, it cannot be used as
upper memory area. Windows will not recognize XGA configurations if
EMM386 is using this address range.
<P>
For more information about modifying your CONFIG.SYS file, see your
MS-DOS documentation. For more information about installing the EMM386
expanded-memory emulator and configuring the way it uses memory, see
Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows," in the Microsoft Windows User's
Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>9.14   Video Seven: VEGA Deluxe card</h3>
 
<P>
The VDDEGA.386 driver that Windows 3.1 supplies does not support the
Video Seven VEGA Deluxe card. If your computer has this video card and
the VDDEGA.386 driver is specified in the [386Enh] section of your
SYSTEM.INI file, your display may not be readable. To correct this
problem, you can do one of the following:
<P>
<PRE>   - Run Windows in standard mode only.
   - Contact Video Seven for a video display driver that supports the
     VEGA Deluxe card.
   - Replace the VEGA Deluxe card with a Windows-compatible card.

</PRE><h3>10.0  Using Specific Mice with Windows Version 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
This section describes some problems you may encounter using specific
types of mice with Windows version 3.1.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>10.1  Microsoft Mouse</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 3.1 includes version 8.20 of the Microsoft mouse drivers. If
you have a Microsoft mouse, Setup installs the Windows mouse driver
(MOUSE.DRV) in your Windows SYSTEM directory and an MS-DOS mouse
driver (MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS) in your Windows directory. If you have
additional versions of the Microsoft mouse drivers on your system,
make sure that you are using the mouse drivers provided with Windows
3.1.
<P>
If you use the Microsoft Mouse Control Panel version 8.0 or later, you
need to set your MS-DOS mouse variable to the directory on your hard
disk that contains the control-panel program files POINT.EXE and
PANEL.COM. You can do this by modifying your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For
example, if the control-panel program files are located in the \MOUSE
directory, you would add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
<PRE>   set mouse=c:\mouse

</PRE>This ensures that the mouse settings are stored in the MOUSE.INI file
located in the specified directory. If the mouse variable is not set
correctly, you may experience problems with mouse acceleration and
other mouse settings.
<P>
It is recommended that you use the mouse driver MOUSE.COM instead of
MOUSE.SYS, and that you load MOUSE.COM from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If
you use MOUSE.SYS, you may encounter problems saving MS-DOS mouse
control-panel settings. If you must use MOUSE.SYS and encounter
problems saving mouse settings, make sure you load it from your mouse
directory instead of from your Windows directory.
<P>
<P><h3>10.2  Genius Mouse</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a Genius mouse and are running non-Windows
applications in 386 enhanced mode, the mouse may not work properly,
especially if you have several non-Windows applications running at the
same time.
<P>
To correct this problem, add the following line to the [386Enh]
section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   local=PC$MOUSE

</PRE>For more information about changing settings in the SYSTEM.INI file,
see the SYSINI.WRI online document.
<P>
<P><h3>10.3  Logitech Mouse</h3>
 
<P>
- Some Logitech mouse models are detected as "Microsoft or IBM PS/2"
<PRE>  mouse models by the Setup program. In this case, Setup will install
  the mouse driver for the Microsoft or IBM PS/2 mouse. If you have a
  Logitech mouse, you should use the Logitech mouse driver instead.

  To install the Logitech mouse driver, run Windows Setup from the
  Main group, and then select Logitech from the list of Mouse options.
  For more information about using Setup after you have installed
  Windows, see Chapter 15, "Maintaining Windows with Setup," in the
  Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

</PRE>- When installing the Logitech mouse driver, Windows Setup copies the
<PRE>  LMOUSE.COM file to your Windows directory. This is the mouse driver
  that is required in order to use the Logitech mouse with non-Windows
  applications. To use your mouse with non-Windows applications, you
  need to load LMOUSE.COM before you start Windows. You can do this by
  adding it to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. You will also need to add the
  following line to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:

     local=PC$MOUSE

</PRE><h3>10.4  Logitech Cordless Mouse</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a Logitech Cordless mouse and you run Windows in 386
enhanced mode, you may encounter problems, such as an unresponsive
pointer, when running MS-DOS Prompt or non-Windows applications in a
window. To correct this problem, you need to do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Change the baud-rate setting for the mouse driver. To do this, add
   the following line to the [LogiMouse] section of the SYSTEM.INI
   file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      BaudRate=1200
</PRE>
<P><LI>Include the 1200 option in the command line that loads the MS-DOS
   Logitech mouse driver (which is provided with Windows 3.1) as
   follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      LMOUSE 1200
</PRE><P>
</OL>Add the above line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to load the mouse driver
each time you start your system. The next time you start Windows, your
mouse should work correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>10.5  Logitech or Microsoft Ballpoint Mouse on a Toshiba T2200SX</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a Toshiba T2200SX computer with a BIOS version
earlier than 1.20 and you have a Logitech or Microsoft ballpoint mouse
connected to the PS/2 mouse port, you may have problems moving the
mouse pointer. If the mouse does not respond, try connecting your
mouse to the serial port instead, or contact Toshiba for an upgraded
version of the BIOS.
<P>
<P><h3>10.6  Mouse Systems Mouse on PS/2 Ports</h3>
 
<P>
The "Mouse Systems" serial and bus mouse drivers provided with Windows
do not support a Mouse Systems mouse when it is connected to a PS/2
style mouse port. If you are using a Mouse Systems mouse connected to
a PS/2 style mouse port, Setup installs the "Microsoft or IBM PS/2"
mouse driver for you. This is the correct driver. Do not change it.
<P>
<P><h3>10.7  Mouse Systems optical mouse</h3>
 
<P>
Setup does not detect "Mouse Systems" optical mouse. However, the
optical mouse is compatible with Windows 3.1. To use the "Mouse
Systems" optical mouse, you need to install its driver with
Windows Setup. For instructions, see "Installing a Device Driver Not
Supplied with Windows Version 3.1" in Chapter 15, "Maintaining Windows
with Setup," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>11.0 Using Additional Hardware Configurations with Windows Version 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
This section contains information about using Windows version 3.1 with
different types of computers and hardware configurations.
<P>
<P><h3>11.1  CD-ROM Drives</h3>
 
<P>
- If you are using a CD-ROM drive with Windows 3.1, you should use
<PRE>  version 2.21 of Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) with all
  configurations of CD-ROM drives. If you use version 2.20 or later,
  you must also remove the following setting from the [386Enh] section
  of the SYSTEM.INI file:

     device=LANMAN10.386

  This setting can cause some CD-ROM drives to timeout and fail with
  versions later than 2.20 of MSCDEX. However, if you must use a
  version earlier than 2.20 of MSCDEX, the above setting is required
  in the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file.

</PRE></OL>- If a CD-ROM drive causes instability in your system or causes your
<PRE>  system to fail, you may need to update the CD-ROM driver. Also, the
  MCI (Media Control Interface) driver MCICDA.DRV may not work
  properly with older CD-ROM drivers. Contact your CD-ROM-drive
  manufacturer about obtaining an updated driver.

</PRE><h3>11.2  EISA Systems with More Than 16 Megabytes of Extended Memory</h3>
 
<P>
On some EISA (extended industry standard architecture) computers,
there may be more extended memory available than the system's Int
15h/88h BIOS call can detect. On these computers, HIMEM.SYS uses only
the amount of extended memory detected. This can result in a large
amount of unused memory.
<P>
You can have HIMEM.SYS use all available extended memory by using the
/EISA option in the CONFIG.SYS file. For example, if HIMEM.SYS is
located in your WINDOWS directory, you would use the following command
line in the CONFIG.SYS file to take advantage of all available
extended memory:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\windows\himem.sys /EISA

</PRE>If you use the /EISA option, do not load any device drivers that use
the Int 15h/88h BIOS call to allocate extended memory before loading
HIMEM.SYS. If you do, your system may not work properly. If you must
reserve some extended memory for device drivers or applications that
use the Int 15h/88h BIOS call, you can specify the amount of memory in
kilobytes that you want reserve by using the /INT15= option. For
example, if you want to reserve 128 kilobytes of extended memory, you
would use the following command line in the CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\windows\himem.sys /EISA /INT15=128

</PRE>HIMEM.SYS must still be loaded before other device drivers in the
CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
To determine if your device driver or application use the Int15h/88h
BIOS call, see the documentation for your device or contact your
device dealer. For more information about using HIMEM.SYS with the
INT15 option, see Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows," in the Microsoft
Windows User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>11.3  Epson Screen Savers</h3>
 
<P>
Some Epson computers have screen-saver utilities that clear the screen
after a specified period of inactivity. With Windows version 3.1, the
screen saver might detect that the system is idle when it is not.
Windows will function properly even though the screen is blank, but
nothing will be displayed until you quit Windows and then restart it.

<P>
If you are using an NCR 925 with EMM386.EXE, include the following
option on the device=emm386.exe command line in your CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
<PRE>   device=EMM386.EXE X=E000-EFFF

</PRE><h3>11.6  Non-US Keyboard Layouts: Using Application Shortcut Keys</h3>
 
<P>
Some non-US keyboards show two characters per alphabet key and three
characters per alphanumeric key. To type the second or third
character, you must press and hold down CTRL+ALT or ALTGR before
pressing the key. If you are using such a keyboard layout, do not use
keys that show two or three characters as application shortcut keys.
<P>
<P><h3>11.7  Plus Hardcard</h3>
 
<P>
- To run Windows version 3.1 with a Hardcard, you must include the
<PRE>  following line in the [386Enh] section in the SYSTEM.INI file:

      VirtualHDIRQ=Off

  For information on how to modify the SYSTEM.INI file, see the
  SYSINI.WRI online document.

  Note:  This procedure is not necessary if you are using a Hardcard
  II or a Hardcard II XL.

</PRE>- It is also recommended that you use SMARTDrive with a Hardcard. For
<PRE>  more information about using SMARTDrive, see Chapter 14, "Optimizing
  Windows," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.


</PRE><h3>11.8  SCSI Hard Disk Using DMA</h3>
 
<P>
If your computer has a SCSI hard disk that uses Direct Memory Access
(DMA), you must include the following entry in the [386Enh] section of
the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   VirtualHDIRQ=Off

</PRE>In addition, you must have SMARTDrive installed and you must NOT
disable double-buffering by removing or remarking out the \D option in
the CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
<P><h3>11.9 Columbia Data Products SCSI Hard-Disk Controller</h3>
 
<P>
To use the Columbia Data Products SCSI hard-disk controller with
Windows version 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode, you must update the Columbia
Data Products SCSI driver to version 3.35 or higher.
<P>
<P><h3>11.10 Serial Ports on 80286-Based Computers: Improving Performance</h3>
 
<P>
If the bit rate-setting for your COM ports is 9600 bits per second (BPS) or
higher and you are experiencing slow COM performance or are losing
characters when sending or receiving information using a communications
application in standard mode, try the following solutions to correct the
problem. Try solution one first. If that doesn't work, then try solution
two, and so on:

<OL><P><LI>Reduce the number of MS-DOS drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident
   programs (TSRs) loaded from your CONFIG.SYS file.

<P><LI>Add the following line to the [standard] section of the SYSTEM.INI
   file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      FasterModeSwitch=1
</PRE><P>
   Note: The FasterModeSwitch setting may not work on older systems or
   systems that are incompatible with Windows version 3.1. In this
   case, Windows may fail when you start it.

<P><LI>Do not load MS-DOS 5.0 into upper memory (do not include the
   command line dos=high in your CONFIG.SYS file).
<P>
</OL><h3>11.11  Sound Blaster Audio Card</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a Sound Blaster audio card that includes a Digital
Signal Processor (DSP) chip earlier than version 2.0, you may want to
upgrade to version 2.0 to improve audio performance. To find out which
version of the DSP chip you currently have, run the TEST-SBC.EXE
utility included in your Sound Blaster package. To receive version 2.0
of the DSP chip, contact Creative Labs, Inc.
<P>
<P><h3>11.12  Tandy 2500 XL with MS-DOS in ROM</h3>
 
<P>
The Tandy 2500 XL can be configured to use MS-DOS in read-only memory
(ROM). If you want to use this feature, after you run Windows Setup
you must run the Tandy setup program (SETUPXL). Modify your
configuration so that your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files are read
from drive C.
<P>
<P><h3>11.13  Wyse Computers</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a Wyse computer to run Windows, you might need to
modify the device=HIMEM.SYS line in your CONFIG.SYS file to read:
<P>
<PRE>   device=[path]HIMEM.SYS  /M:WYSE

</PRE></OL><h3>11.14  Memory Chips: Parity Errors</h3>
 
<P>
If you are receiving parity errors while running Windows 3.1, you
probably have a bad memory chip, even if you didn't have parity errors
while running Windows 3.0. (Windows 3.0 did not detect parity errors.)
<P>
If you run a memory test utility and it reports that the memory is
fine, you should still have your machine tested. Memory tests, in
general, do not do a good job of detecting parity errors. For
assistance in testing your computer for a bad memory chip, contact
your hardware vendor.
<P>
Some hardware can cause Windows to erroneously generate a parity
error. Windows will display a parity error if the hardware on the
machine generates a nonmaskable interrupt (NMI). Windows will only
display a parity error when a true parity error occurs or when a
system component such as an older autoswitching EGA card can generate
a NMI. It is possible for a card such as this to cause a false parity
error. This only happens when changing video modes.
<P>
For example, if you get a parity error every time you start MS-DOS
Prompt in full-screen mode (the video mode will change from graphics
to text mode), the video card is probably causing an NMI, which causes
Windows 3.1 to display a parity error.
<P>
