The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.1 SETUP.TXT file. This article contains the
second half of the file.
<P>
<P><h2>SETUP.TXT</h2>
 
<P>
This file contains information about problems that may occur while
running Windows for Workgroups Setup and describes problems that can
occur when using terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs or drivers
with Windows for Workgroups or Setup. If you are using a TSR or if you
encounter problems setting up Windows for Workgroups, read this
document BEFORE running Setup again.
<P>
<P><h3>HPEMM386.SYS and HPEMM486.SYS</h3>
 
<P>
These expanded-memory managers are incompatible with Windows for
Workgroups when it is running in 386 enhanced mode. If you plan on
running Windows for Workgroups in 386 enhanced mode, it is recommended
that you use EMM386.EXE to manage memory instead.
<P>
<P><h3>HPMM.SYS - HP Memory Manager</h3>
 
<P>
When HPMM.SYS is running, you cannot set up Windows for Workgroups or
run it in standard mode. You should remove all references to HPMM.SYS
from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files before setting up Windows
for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>Hyperdisk Disk-Cache Utility</h3>
 
<P>
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive.
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows for
Workgroups. It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with
Windows for Workgroups, instead.
<P>
<P><h3>IBM VDISK.SYS (RAM Disk Utility)</h3>
 
<P>
VDISK.SYS is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups because it
occupies extended memory required to run Windows for Workgroups. This
utility prevents any XMS-compatible memory manager from loading.
<P>
<P><h3>IEMM.SYS Memory Manager</h3>
 
<P>
The IEMM.SYS memory manager is incompatible with Windows for
Workgroups. It is recommended that you remove all references to
IEMM.SYS from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and use
EMM386.EXE, provided with Windows for Workgroups, to manage memory
instead.
<P>
<P><h3>ICACHE.SYS Disk-Cache Utility</h3>
 
<P>
Do not use two disk-cache utilities with Windows for Workgroups. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for
Workgroups, and remove all references to other disk-cache utilities
from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If ICACHE.SYS is
detected, Setup removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)
<P>
<P><h3>IBMCACHE.SYS Disk-Cache Utility</h3>
 
<P>
Do not use two disk-cache utilities with Windows for Workgroups. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for
Workgroups, and remove all references to other disk-cache utilities
from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If IBMCACHE.SYS is
detected, Setup removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)
<P>
<P><h3>Intel Expanded-Memory Emulator (ILIM386.SYS)</h3>
 
<P>
The ILIM386.SYS expanded-memory emulator, provided with the Intel
Inboard/386 product, is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups. It
is recommended that you remove all references to this emulator from
your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files before setting up Windows for
Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>JOIN (MS-DOS)</h3>
 
<P>
Do not add or remove "joined" drives while running Windows for
Workgroups. If you use the JOIN command before starting Windows for
Workgroups and do not change the state of the joined drives from MS-
DOS Prompt within Windows, Windows for Workgroups will work properly.
It is recommended that you do not use joined drives at all if you plan
on running Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>KEYB.COM (MS-DOS)</h3>
 
<P>
If you use command-line options to load KEYB.COM, it is recommended
that you load it before starting Windows for Workgroups. After it is
loaded, you can change the keyboard configuration from MS-DOS Prompt
within Windows at any time. If you do not load KEYB.COM before
starting Windows, you may encounter problems when using a KEYB command
that includes an option in an MS-DOS Prompt. However, you can use the
KEYB command without options at any time to display code-page
information.
<P>
<P><h3>Lansight Version 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
Lansight is a utility that you can use to control and monitor other
workstations attached to a Novell network. In some cases, version 2.0
of Lansight may cause the workstation running Windows for Workgroups
to fail.
<P>
Lasertool Control Panel Version 2.2
 
<P>
If you load version 2.2 of the Lasertool Control Panel program
(PCPANEL.EXE) from Windows for Workgroups, your system may fail. This
program works properly if you load it before starting Windows for
Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>Le Menu Version 1.0</h3>
 
<P>
When using Le Menu version 1.0 with Windows for Workgroups,
environment information such as PATH, PROMPT and WINDIR may be lost if
you start MS-DOS Prompt from within Windows. If you want to start
Windows for Workgroups by using a Le Menu menu command, it is
recommended that you set up Windows for Workgroups as a Batch-File
menu command so that COMMAND.COM will load before starting Windows for
Workgroups. For more information, see your Le Menu documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>LOCKIT Version 3.3 (PC Vault, Secure It)</h3>
 
<P>
Version 3.3 of these programs strip out spaces from the load= command
line in the WIN.INI file. Later versions may correct this problem.
<P>
Logitech Mouse Software Version 5.0/6.0 (CLICK, LOGIMENU)
 
<P>
If you want to use CLICK and LOGIMENU from MS-DOS Prompt within
Windows, you must load the TSRs from that MS-DOS Prompt, even if you
loaded the TSRs before starting Windows for Workgroups. When you quit
Windows for Workgroups, you must reload the TSRs for them to work
properly from the command prompt outside of Windows, even if you
loaded them from MS-DOS Prompt within Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Mace Disk-Cache Utility (MCACHE.SYS)</h3>
 
<P>
This disk-cache utility will not work properly with SMARTDrive. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for
Workgroups, and remove all references to other disk-cache utilities
from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If Mace is detected,
Setup removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)
<P>
<P><h3>Maximizer Memory Manager (MAXIMIZE.COM)</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using the Maximizer memory manager, you may not be able to
set up or start Windows for Workgroups. Make sure that you are using
only one memory manager with Windows for Workgroups. It is recommended
that you use HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE, which are provided with Windows
for Workgroups, to manage memory instead.
<P>
<P><h3>MIRROR (MS-DOS)</h3>
 
<P>
If MIRROR is loaded from Windows for Workgroups by using the Run
command in standard mode, you cannot remove it from memory by using
the MIRROR /U command. This will cause an error message to appear.
<P>
<P><h3>NDOSEDIT.COM (Date 1-1-84)</h3>
 
<P>
You may have problems loading this command-line editor. Also, it may
cause unexpected results when running with Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>NetRoom Memory Manager (RM386.SYS)</h3>
 
<P>
With some older versions of NetRoom, you may encounter problems
setting up Windows for Workgroups. In this case, contact Helix
Software for a newer version of NetRoom.
<P>
<P><h3>NetWare NetBIOS</h3>
 
<P>
The NetWare NetBIOS TSR is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups in
many configurations. In most cases, Setup will detect NetWare NetBIOS
and remove the startup command from your system. However, if you have
NetWare NetBIOS set up to start from a location other than your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file (for example, from a batch file), Setup cannot
detect it. In this case, you need to remove NetWare NetBIOS manually.
For information about configuring Windows for Workgroups to work with
the NetWare NetBIOS TSR, see the NETWORKS.WRI online document.
<P>
<P><h3>Newspace Version 1.07</h3>
 
<P>
This disk-compression utility is incompatible with Windows for
Workgroups and may cause several problems.
<P>
<P><h3>Norton Anti-Virus Version 1.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you load version 1.0 of Anti-Virus before setting up Windows for
Workgroups, Setup may fail. It is recommended that you contact
Symantec for the most current version of this program.
<P>
<P><h3>Norton Desktop for Windows (EP.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
If the data-recovery program Erase Protect (EP.EXE) is loaded from the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you need to disable it when setting up Windows for
Workgroups, especially if you are upgrading over a previous version of
Windows. Erase Protect tries to save copies of all deleted files,
which can cause you to run out of disk space while running Setup.
<P>
It is recommended that you run Erase Protect with a permanent swap
file, not a temporary swap file. If you are using a temporary swap
file, you need to exclude files having a .TMP or .SWP extension from
erase protection.
<P>
<P><h3>Norton Utilities Version 5.0 (DISKREET, NCACHE)</h3>
 
<P>
This program is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups and may cause
your system to fail. It is recommended that you upgrade to the most
recent version of Norton Utilities to correct problems.
<P>
<P><h3>Norton Utilities Version. 6.01 (NCACHE)</h3>
 
<P>
Some versions of NCACHE may prevent you from setting up or starting
Windows for Workgroups. When Windows for Workgroups is running in
standard mode, your system may fail, especially if NCACHE is set up as
an EMS cache. Setting up NCACHE as an EMS cache is not recommended.
Setting up NCACHE as an XMS cache may solve the problem.
<P>
You may also encounter additional problems using NCACHE. New versions
may correct these problems. For an updated version of NCACHE, contact
Symantec Corporation. In the meantime, you can use SMARTDrive, which
is provided with Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>Norton Utilities Version 6.01 (DISKMON)</h3>
 
<P>
It is recommended that you do not use DISKMON version 6.01 with
Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>PCED Version 2.00</h3>
 
<P>
Do not load the PCED command-line editor HIGH. Loading it HIGH may
cause unexpected results, such as system failures, when Windows for
Workgroups is running in 386 enhanced mode. If you load this program
before starting Windows for Workgroups, it may be unavailable when
Windows for Workgroups is running in standard mode.
<P>
<P><h3>PCKEY.EXE (MultiSoft Keyboard Enhancer and Command-Line Stack)</h3>
 
<P>
PCKEY.EXE may not work properly with Windows for Workgroups when you
are running more than one MS-DOS--based application at a time. It is
recommended that you unload PCKEY.EXE before starting Windows for
Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>PC-Kwik Disk Accelerator</h3>
 
<P>
If you use PC-Kwik when Windows for Workgroups is running in 386
enhanced mode, make sure that you are using version 3.55 or later and
that PC-Kwik is in extended memory, not expanded memory. To get an
upgraded version of PC-Kwik, contact MultiSoft.
<P>
<P><h3>PC-Kwik Disk-Cache Utility (PC-KWIK.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive.
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows for
Workgroups. It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with
Windows for Workgroups, instead.
<P>
<P><h3>PC-Kwik Version. 1.59 (PCK.EXE, PSKSCRN.EXE, PCKEY.COM)</h3>
 
<P>
If version 1.59 of PC-KWIK is loaded before setting up Windows for
Workgroups, Setup may fail. PC-KWIK Version 2.0 may correct this
problem.
<P>
<P><h3>PCSXMAEM.SYS Utility</h3>
 
<P>
This utility is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups. You should
remove all references to it from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
files before setting up or starting Windows for Workgroups.
PCSXMAEM.SYS is similar to XMAEM.SYS. It has been renamed and slightly
modified. It is provided with current versions of the IBM PC/3270
emulator.
<P>
<P><h3>PCSX2EMS.SYS</h3>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups will run correctly with PCSX2EMS.SYS if it is
loaded on a computer that has an XMA board installed. Otherwise, this
program is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups. PCSX2EMS.SYS is
provided with the IBM PC/3270 emulator.
<P>
<P><h3>PC Tools Deluxe Version 7.1 (DATAMON)</h3>
 
<P>
If you load PC Tools DATAMON using the \SENTRY+ option, Setup may fail
if you are low on disk space. Do not use the \SENTRY+ option when
loading DATAMON.
<P>
Do not load DATAMON after loading SMARTDrive. If DATAMON is loaded
after SMARTDrive, your system may fail. See the PC Tools documentation
for information about how to unload DATAMON.
<P>
<P><h3>PC Tools Deluxe Version 6.0 (DESKTOP)</h3>
 
<P>
If you try to start PC Tools from MS-DOS Prompt within Windows for
Workgroups in standard mode, your system may fail. In enhanced mode,
your system may restart itself. These problems also occur if you use
MS-DOS commands from MS-DOS Prompt within Windows.
<P>
Version 7.0 of PC Tools may correct these problems. However, do not
load DESKTOP from MS-DOS Prompt if it was loaded before starting
Windows for Workgroups. If you do, your system may fail when you quit
Windows for Workgroups. It is recommended that you run DESKTOP from
its PIF, provided with Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>PC Tools Deluxe Version 7.1 (VDEFEND)</h3>
 
<P>
Setup may not work properly if VDEFEND is loaded before running Setup.
You may load VDEFEND after setting up Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>PC Tools Disk-Cache Utility (PC-CACHE.COM)</h3>
 
<P>
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive.
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for
Workgroups, instead.
<P>
<P><h3>PRINT (MS-DOS)</h3>
 
<P>
If you are printing several large documents on a network printer and
run Setup from the network, your system may fail while Setup is
creating Program Manager groups.
<P>
<P><h3>PYRO! Version 1.0</h3>
 
<P>
If this screen saver is loaded before starting Windows for Workgroups,
you may not be able to restore the Windows for Workgroups screen after
this screen saver appears.
<P>
MAPS Memory Manager Version 5.16
 
<P>
If you are using the MAPS memory manager, you may not be able to set
up or start Windows for Workgroups. New versions may correct these
problems. For an updated version of MAPS, contact Quadtel. In the
meantime, you may use HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE, provided with Windows
for Workgroups, to manage memory instead.
<P>
<P><h3>RAMTYPE.SYS - AST RAMpage! Boards</h3>
 
<P>
The RAMTYPE.SYS driver is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups. It
is recommended that you remove this driver before setting up Windows
for Workgroups. If you load the driver from your CONFIG.SYS file,
comment out the command line for the driver as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   rem RAMTYPE.SYS

</PRE>Windows for Workgroups will run correctly without RAMTYPE.SYS.
However, other drivers that rely on RAMTYPE.SYS will not load and
applications will not be able to use the expanded memory on your
system.
<P>
After setting up Windows for Workgroups, you can use version 1.2 and
later of RAMTYPE.SYS with Windows for Workgroups. If you are using an
earlier version on an IBM PS/2 or Micro Channel Architecture computer
and your RAMpage! board is configured for expanded and extended
memory, you need to upgrade your AST RAMTYPE.SYS driver after setting
up Windows for Workgroups. You will also need to remove the "rem"
command from your CONFIG.SYS file so that RAMTYPE.SYS will load
properly.
<P>
<P><h3>Secretdisk II Disk-Cache Utility (FAST512.SYS)</h3>
 
<P>
This disk-cache utility will not work properly with SMARTDrive. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for
Workgroups, and remove all references to other disk-cache utilities
from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If this utility is
detected, Setup removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you).
<P>
<P><h3>SideKick Versions 1.0 and 2.0 and SideKick Plus</h3>
 
<P>
Miscellaneous problems may occur when running SideKick as a TSR with
Windows for Workgroups. It is recommended that you use a PIF to run
SideKick as a MS-DOS--based application, instead of loading it as a
TSR.
<P>
<P><h3>SoftIce Debugger</h3>
 
<P>
If SoftIce is loaded, Setup will fail when starting the Windows
portion of the program. It is recommended that you unload SoftIce
before setting up Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>SpeedFXR</h3>
 
<P>
This program is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups when running
as a TSR. It tries to increase the speed of the floppy disk drives,
but slows them down instead. To get the best results, use the -X
option when loading SpeedFXR. This will prevent SpeedFXR from
remaining in memory and affecting the speed of the floppy disk drives.
<P>
<P><h3>SUBST (MS-DOS)</h3>
 
<P>
Do not add or remove "substituted" drives while running Windows for
Workgroups. If you use the SUBST command before starting Windows for
Workgroups and do not change the state of the substituted drives from
MS-DOS Prompt within Windows, Windows for Workgroups will work
properly.
<P>
<P><h3>Super PC-Kwik Disk-Cache Utility (SUPERPCK.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive.
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for
Workgroups, instead.
<P>
<P><h3>Trantor T100 Host Adapter Driver (TSCSI.SYS)</h3>
 
<P>
(For SCSI hard disk drives) - If you use the Trantor T100 driver
(TSCSI.SYS), you must use version 4.33d or higher. Earlier versions
identify the SCSI hard disk drive as a removable drive. This may cause
problems when using File Manager, such as a system failure while
formatting the drive and unexpected results when deleting files. To
get an updated driver, contact Trantor Systems, Ltd.
<P>
<P><h3>UMB PRO Version 1.07</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running UMB PRO, you may experience problems running
Windows for Workgroups in standard mode. In some cases, your system
may fail. Make sure that you are using only one memory manager with
Windows for Workgroups. It is recommended that you use HIMEM.SYS and
EMM386.EXE, which are provided with Windows for Workgroups, to manage
memory instead.
<P>
<P><h3>Vaccine</h3>
 
<P>
If Vaccine is loaded, Setup fails when trying to modify the CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You should unload Vaccine before setting up
Windows for Workgroups. You may also encounter problems, such as
beeping, while running Windows for Workgroups when Vaccine is loaded.
<P>
<P><h3>VIREX-PC Version 1.11</h3>
 
<P>
If VIREXPC.COM is loaded, Setup and Windows for Workgroups will fail
when KRNL386.EXE performs a write operation. Also, the first time
Windows for Workgroups is loaded, you may be returned to the MS-DOS
prompt.
<P>
<P><h3>Virus Prevention Plus Version 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
If Virus Prevention Plus is loaded, you may not be able to
successfully set up Windows for Workgroups. You may also encounter
problems when running Windows for Workgroups in 386 enhanced mode. The
Keyboard Lock program may cause Windows for Workgroups to fail.
<P>
<P><h3>Virusafe Version 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
If this program is loaded as a TSR, Setup may fail while setting up
Windows for Workgroups. It is recommended that you load Virusafe by
using the /C- option. This option turns off the memory-change
detection provided with Virusafe. Version 4.5 may correct this
problem. For more information, see your Virusafe documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>XGAAIDOS.SYS</h3>
 
<P>
With XGAAIDOS.SYS loaded, Windows for Workgroups will fail at the
opening logo if you use the WIN /S option to start Windows for
Workgroups in standard mode.
<P>
<P><h3>XMAEM.SYS</h3>
 
<P>
XMAEM.SYS is a device which causes extended memory to act like XMA.
This utility is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups. It is
recommended that you remove all references to it from your CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files before setting up or running Windows for
Workgroups. XMAEM.SYS is provided with IBM DOS version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h3>XMA2EMS.SYS</h3>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups will run correctly with XMA2EMS.SYS if it is
loaded on a computer that has an XMA board installed. Otherwise, this
program is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups. XMA2EMS.SYS is
provided with IBM DOS version 4.0.
