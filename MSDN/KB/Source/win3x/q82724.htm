<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, the Setup program
can be used to change the configuration of the network after Windows
has been installed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are several limitations in the Windows version of maintenance
mode Setup. In general, Setup should be run from the command prompt
outside of Windows when modifying the network configuration.
<P>
Although Setup can add entries to the LOAD= line in the WIN.INI file,
it cannot remove them. Therefore, when changing from a network that
puts a utility on the LOAD= line in the WIN.INI file to a network that
provides different network utilities, the first utility installed will
continue loading, probably causing an error message. An example is
NWPOPUP.EXE in Novell NetWare.
<P>
When changing networks, you should remove network utilities from the
LOAD= line in the WIN.INI file.
<P>
Some networks have Windows components that do not ship with Windows.
If these components are found in the network directory during Setup,
Setup will configure Windows to use them; otherwise, Setup will use a
default installation and notify you of the missing software.
<P>
Because the descriptions for these network versions are the same,
Setup will not automatically reconfigure Windows to use the components
if they are later copied to the machine. To correctly reconfigure
Windows to use the added network components, you must run maintenance
mode Setup twice; once to set the network to "No Network Installed,"
and once to set it back to the original network version. Note that
maintenance mode Setup does not perform detection. You must know which
network entry to select.
