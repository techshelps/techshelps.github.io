The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you dial a Remote Access Services (RAS) server, the modem starts to
initialize and then the following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 692: Hardware failure in port or attached device.

</PRE>Or, when you try to manually dial a RAS server, the following error message
appears after you choose the Done button:
<P>
<PRE>   all devices connected

</PRE>The computer then stops responding (hangs).
<P>
NOTE: In this situation, other Windows-based communication applications
(such as Windows for Workgroups Terminal) appear to work correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These error messages occur if RAS cannot correctly communicate with the
modem. There are several possible causes:

<UL><LI>The modem is turned off or malfunctioning. Try resetting the modem.

<LI>The serial cable is incorrect. If you suspect this is the case, refer to
   the "Cabling Requirements" section in Help for more information about
   requirements for correct cabling.

<LI>If the serial cable is loose. Remove the cable and then reattach it.

<LI>The handshaking options for the modem need to be adjusted.

<LI>The modem is unsupported, or the chosen emulation may be incorrect.
<P>
   RAS uses a file called MODEM.INF in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory to
   send the right communication strings to the modem through the selected
   modem in RAS. Use a text editor, such as Windows Write, with the No
   Conversion option selected to open the MODEM.INF file. Then find the
   modem you have selected in RAS and check the COMMAND_INIT string, which
   is the communication string RAS sends to set up the modem for
   communication. Refer to the modem documentation or check with the modem
   manufacturer for the correct communication string for your modem.

<LI>You did not choose the correct modem for use with RAS. Check your
   modem installation as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      1. Choose the RAS icon in the Network group.
      2. Choose Setup from the menu list.
      3. Select Configure.
      4. Check the device selected and the port to which it is assigned.
</PRE>
<LI>The COMM.DRV file located in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory is not the
   one that ships with Windows for Workgroups version 3.11. See the
   appropriate section below.

<LI>You are using an XJACK modem and need an updated MODEM.INF file. See
   the appropriate section below.

<LI>You are using an GVC FM14400 modem need an updated MODEM.INF file. See
   the appropriate section below.

<LI>You are using a US-Robotics 14400 Sportster. See the appropriate
   section below.
<P>
</UL>If you are not using one of the above modems, or if you are using one of
them but have followed the procedures in this article without success, use
the steps in the next section to try to isolate the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Checking for the Correct COMM.DRV File</h3>
 
<P>
The COMM.DRV file that ships with Windows for Workgroups 3.11 has a file
date of 11/01/93 and a file size of 5968 bytes. If the COMM.DRV file is
incorrect, rename it and then expand a new copy from Windows for Workgroups
3.11 Disk 2 (for both the 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch disk sets) by using the
following command
<P>
<PRE>   expand &lt;drive letter&gt;:\comm.dr_ c:\windows\system\comm.drv

</PRE>where &lt;drive letter&gt; names the drive containing Disk 2.
<P>
<P><h3>You Are Using an XJACK Modem and Need an Updated MODEM.INF File</h3>
 
<P>
Obtain the new MODEM.INF file that Megahertz has written for its PCMCIA
modems. The file can be found in the Modem Vendor forum on CompuServe (go
modemvend) in the MEGAHERTZ library. The file to download is RASDRI.EXE.
<P>
To install the new MODEM.INF file, rename the original MODEM.INF in the
Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, and copy the new file to that same directory.
<P>
<P><h3>You Are Using a GVC FM14400 Modem</h3>
 
<P>
Obtain the new GVC MODEM.INF file from the GVC bulletin board service
(BBS). The file to download is WFWRA.EXE.
<P>
To install the new MODEM.INF file, rename the original MODEM.INF in the
Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, and copy the new file to that same directory.
<P>
<P><h3>You Are Using a US-Robotics 14400 Sportster or Courier V.32bis</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft does not encourage nor support user changes to .INF files;
therefore, Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) does not support the
procedure in this article. Although we have tested the following procedure
and it appears to function as described; we strongly recommend that you
make a backup copy of your .INF file before you proceed.
<P>
To correct this problem, edit the modem initialization entry
(COMMAND_INIT=) in the [US Robotics Sportster 14400] or [US Robotics
Courier V.32bis] section of the MODEM.INF file as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Run Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Write and open the MODEM.INF file.

<P><LI>Choose the No Conversion button.

<P><LI>From the Find menu, choose Find.

<P><LI>In the Find What box, type "[US Robotics Sportster 14400]" or
   "[US Robotics Courier V.32bis]" (without the quotation marks) and
   then choose Find Next.

<P><LI>Choose Cancel and then change "AT&amp;F" to "ATZ&amp;F" and add "X7"
   (without the quotation marks). For example, change
<P>
<P><PRE>      COMMAND_INIT=AT&amp;F&amp;C1&amp;D2 V1 S0=0 S2=128 S7=55 W1 S95=44
</PRE><P>
   to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      COMMAND_INIT=ATZ&amp;F&amp;C1&amp;D2 X7 V1 S0=0 S2=128 S7=55 W1 S95=44
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the MODEM.INF file.

<P><LI>Quit and restart RAS Phonebook.
<P>
   This issues a reset command that resets the modem to the factory
   defaults.
<P></OL>
