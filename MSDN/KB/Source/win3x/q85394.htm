<OL><P><LI>Above Board 286 and Above Board Plus Installation
<P><PRE>    Programs
</OL></PRE> 
<P>
CAUTION: The Intel Above Board installation program that
<PRE>         shipped before May 1989 tests extended memory in a
         way that can corrupt extended memory.

</PRE></OL>Before using an Above Board installation program prior to
May 1989, make sure you haven't loaded software such as
SMARTDrive or RAMDrive that uses extended memory.  After the
Above Board has been installed, other software using
extended memory is unaffected.

<OL><P><LI>AutoCAD
</OL> 
To run AutoCAD release 10 and 11 (AutoCad 386) with MS-DOS,
contact Autodesk.
<P>
When running AutoCad 386 under Windows 3.1, note the following:
<P>
<PRE> * AutoCad 386 runs in standard mode only if no LIMulator is
   installed. To run in 386 enhanced mode, you must upgrade to
   AutoCad for Windows.

</PRE></OL>*  The PIF setting for AutoCad 386 are set for a minimum
<PRE>   configuration. Using these setting results in poor performance.
   To improve performance, you can modify the PIF settings, as
   described below.

 PIF Settings
 ------------

 To improve the performance of AutoCad 386, make the following changes
 to the standard mode PIF:

    XMS MEMORY REQUIRED should be set to 1. This forces XMS memory to
</PRE>be
<PRE>    provided to an application. Unless a required amount is listed, no
    XMS memory is provided.

    XMS MEMORY DESIRED should be set from 1024 to 4096. 1024
</PRE>significantly
<PRE>    improves performance. The manufacturer recommends 4096 for best
    performance.

    OTHER REQUIREMENTS: For these settings to work, you must have
    adequate XMS memory available. If there is not enough, no adverse
    effects are apparent, but performance is only improved by the real
    amount of XMS provided. You must also have an equivalent amount of
    disk space free for a swap file.


</PRE><P><LI>AUTORUN.EXE
</OL> 
If you can't use Mountain Network Solutions AUTORUN.EXE, a
tape-drive backup program, contact your vendor for an
upgrade.

<OL><P><LI>CodeView
</OL> 
CAUTION: Using versions 3.0 to 3.13 of the CodeView CV.EXE
file may cause data loss if your system has a 80386 memory
manager (such as EMM386.EXE) and device drivers or programs
that use extended memory. To determine which version you
have, type CV.EXE at the command prompt.
<P>
To start CodeView versions 3.0 to 3.13 safely, use the
CV.COM file included with MS-DOS 5.0, and HIMEM.SYS version
2.77 or later.
<P>
To use the CV.COM file included with MS-DOS 5.0, copy it
from the Setup disks to the directory that contains your
CV.EXE file.
<P>
This problem has been fixed in CodeView version 3.14. Call
Microsoft C Support to get this version.

<OL><P><LI>Easel 6.0
</OL> 
Interactive Images Easel 6.0 is incompatible with the
DOS=HIGH and EMM386 commands. Contact your vendor for an

or
<P>
LOADFIX FBINSTAL.EXE
<P>
For information about the LOADFIX command, see the section

of Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS Getting Started.

<OL><P><LI>GeoWorks
</OL> 
If you have a version of GeoWorks (PC/GEOS) earlier than
1.2, use the SETVER command to report version number 4.01 to
the GEOS.EXE file. Type the following:
<P>
SETVER GEOS.EXE 4.01
<P>

compatible with MS-DOS 5.0. If you have a version earlier
than 1.01, contact your vendor for an upgrade.

<OL><P><LI>Paintbrush 2.0
</OL> 
If you have an EGA monitor and want to run Microsoft or
ZSoft Paintbrush 2.0, you must remove the DEVICE=EGA.SYS
command from your CONFIG.SYS file. After removing the
command, you may have difficulty with screen swapping when
using Task Swapper in MS-DOS Shell.

<OL><P><LI>Paradox 3.5
</OL> 
For information about Paradox version 3.5, see the section
"Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.1 won't start" in Chapter 4 of

earlier than 2.0 into the upper memory area.

<OL><P><LI>PeachTree Complete III Single-User Version
</OL>

Complete III (batch 01 through batch 13), contact PeachTree
for an update.

memory.

<OL><P><LI>Task Swapper and Asynchronous I/O
</OL> 
Some programs that perform asynchronous communications are
incompatible with MS-DOS Shell Task Swapper. Terminal-
emulation software (such as SmartCom and Procomm Plus) and
server/client software (such as Laplink and Blast) are
asynchronous communications programs. If you can't use an
asynchronous program with Task Swapper, contact your vendor
for more information, or disable Task Swapper.
