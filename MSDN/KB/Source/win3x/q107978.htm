The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you exit Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, your system may
stop responding (hang). If EMM386.EXE is loaded, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   EMM Exception Error #6

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because:

<UL><LI>The processor is trying to decode a bit pattern that does not
   correspond to any legal machine instruction.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The processor is trying to execute an instruction that contains
   invalid operands.
<P>
</UL>Both of these causes mean that the processor (CPU) is trying to execute
code from an incorrect area in memory. Either an application is passing an
invalid jump instruction (causing a jump to an incorrect memory location)
or the jump instruction is correct but the memory that the instruction
accesses is corrupted.
<P>
NOTE: Although you receive an EMM exception error, EMM386.EXE is not
causing the problem. When the processor encounters a problem executing
an instruction, it looks for an error handler. When you exit Windows for
Workgroups it uses the default error handler. If EMM386.EXE is installed,
you receive the EMM Exception Error. If EMM386.EXE is not installed, the
machine may stop responding (hang).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot this problem, follow the steps in this procedure. After
each step, you should reboot your computer, run Windows for Workgroups,
and then attempt to successfully exit Windows for Workgroups. When Windows
for Workgroups exits successfully, you have isolated the problem.

<OL><P><LI>If you ran MS-DOS 6 or 6.2 MemMaker before installing Windows for
   Workgroups, run MemMaker again.

<P><LI>Eliminate potential software conflicts as follows:
<P>
   a. Remove any third-party device drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident
<P><PRE>      (TSR) programs  that are not required to access your hard drive from
      your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      For information on device drivers that should not be remarked out,
      query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         wfw clean boot

   b. Ensure that the Windows for Workgroups StartUp group is empty.

   c. Ensure that no screen savers, including built-in Windows screen
      savers, are running. In the Control Panel, choose the Desktop icon
      and verify that the Screen Saver Name list box is empty.

   d. Ensure that Windows is not being run from a menu program, such as
      MS-DOS Shell.

   e. Edit the WIN.INI file and comment out the LOAD= and RUN= lines
      (unless they are already blank). To comment out these lines, place
      a semicolon (;) in front of the line. For example:

         ;load=&lt;filename1&gt; &lt;filename2&gt;

   f. Edit the SYSTEM.INI file and comment out any third-party virtual
      device drivers (VxDs).

   g. If possible, disable NDIS2 protocols like TCP or DLC.

</PRE><P><LI>Eliminate potential hardware conflicts:
<P>
   a. Turn off hardware caching.
<P>
   b. Turn off shadow ram and video memory.

<P><LI>Edit the CONFIG.SYS file and exclude A000-F7FF to eliminate
   potential upper memory area (UMA) conflicts. To do this, add
   "X=A000-F7FF" to the DEVICE command for EMM386.EXE in the
   CONFIG.SYS file.

<P><LI>Remark out the device command for EMM386.EXE in the CONFIG.SYS file
   and then run Windows for Workgroups with the "/D:X" parameter. For
   example, type "win /d:x" (without the quotation marks) at the
   MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Start Windows for Workgroups with the WIN /N command. This loads
   Windows for Workgroups without loading any network support. If the
   problem does not occur without network software loaded, a
   hardware device may be conflicting with your network card.
<P>
</OL>If Windows for Workgroups still hangs when you exit, you still have
a memory conflict; however, it is not in the upper memory area (UMA).
