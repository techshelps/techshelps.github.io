<P><h3>1.0  General Notes</h3>
 
<P>
- There are many settings in the SYSTEM.INI file that affect the way
<PRE>  Windows interacts with a network. You can change these settings to
  correct most problems you might have operating Windows with your
  network. See the SYSINI.WRI online document for information about
  changing the following SYSTEM.INI settings:

</PRE>[Boot]
Network.drv=
<P>
[Standard]
Int28Filter=
NetHeapSize=
<P>
[386Enh]
AllVMsExclusive=
EMMExclude=
FileSysChange=
InDOSPolling=
Int28Critical=
NetAsyncFallback=
NetAsyncTimeout=
NetDMASize=
NetHeapSize=
Network=
PSPIncrement=
ReflectDOSInt2A=
TimerCriticalSection=
TokenRingSearch=
UniqueDOSPSP=
<P>
- Many networks require the TimerCriticalSection entry in the [386Enh]
<PRE>  section of the SYSTEM.INI file to be set to a value of 10000 or
  greater. For more information, see the SYSINI.WRI file.

</PRE>- The default value for the NetHeapSize entry in the [Standard]
<PRE>  section of the SYSTEM.INI file is 8K. Although some applications
  require this value, in most cases you can decrease the value to 4K
  in order to increase the amount of memory available to your
  applications. A few applications require the value to be 4K.

</PRE>- If for some reason you use Setup to change your network
<PRE>  configuration after you have already set up Windows, Setup might not
  remove all support for your previous network selection. Unnecessary
  files might be left in your Windows directory, and entries might be
  left in your WIN.INI or SYSTEM.INI files that could harm your
  system's performance. If you change your network configuration,
  check the notes about both your previous and new selections to see
  if any previous entries are no longer required.

</PRE>- Some network adapter cards require the ExcludeHighRegion (or
<PRE>  EMMExclude) entry in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file to
  be set to the memory range used by the card. For more information,
  see your network-adapter documentation and the SYSINI.WRI file.

  These cards may also require an X= option on the EMM386 command line
  in your CONFIG.SYS file. For more information, see chapter 14,
  "Optimizing Windows," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

</PRE>- Some network cards and some network transport stacks require special
<PRE>  handling. Consult the following sections not only for the
  manufacturer of your network but also for the manufacturer of your
  network adapter and your transport stack.

</PRE>- Many networks have pop-up message facilities that allow you to see
<PRE>  messages sent from other servers or workstations. In most cases,
  these pop-up programs will cause the Windows part of Setup to fail
  if a message is received while setting up. Many networks provide
  additional utilities that allow them to work with Windows once
  Windows is set up, but these are generally not available during
  Setup. You should make sure any such pop-up service is disabled
  before setting up Windows. Please consult specific entries regarding
  your network in the following sections, or consult your network
  documentation for instructions.

</PRE>- If you configured your remote-boot workstation to run Windows
<PRE>  version 3.0, you may be loading a program called RIPLMEM.EXE or
  RPLMEM.EXE in your AUTOEXEC.BAT. This program is no longer required
  for running Windows version 3.1.

</PRE>- The Windows Resource Kit for the Microsoft Windows Operating System
<PRE>  Version 3.1 contains additional information about setting up and
  configuring Windows for use with a network, and information for
  system administrators. This kit provides complete technical
  information about Windows version 3.1 for the support professional.
  It includes a technical reference manual, and a disk containing
  helpful utilities, system resource viewers, drivers, and
  accessories.

  To order the Windows Resource Kit within the United States, dial:

   1-800-642-7676

  To order outside of the United States, dial the phone number for
  your area. You can find this number on the International Subsidiary
  card.

</PRE>- If you are running a shared copy of Windows from a network drive,
<PRE>  make sure both your personal Windows directory and the shared
  network directory are included on the PATH command line in your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

</PRE>- If you receive sharing violations while running a shared copy of
<PRE>  Windows, make sure that all of the files in the shared network
  directory are marked as read-only.

</PRE>- If you have problems running a shared copy of Windows, remove the
<PRE>  MS-DOS SHARE command from your system. With some networks, the
  MS-DOS SHARE utility must not be loaded on a workstation to run a
  shared copy of Windows.

</PRE>- If you have problems and your network software is loaded high (in
<PRE>  the upper memory area between 640K and 1 MB), try loading the
  network in conventional memory.

</PRE>- Windows Print Manager spools print jobs to the location specified by
<PRE>  The MS-DOS environment variable TEMP. If TEMP is not set, Print
  Manager will use the root of drive C. For diskless workstations, set
  the TEMP variable either to a RAM disk or to the location of a
  network directory (you must have full access to this directory). The
  TEMP variable may be set by placing a SET TEMP= statement in the
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file or network login script. For example, to spool to
  the network directory X:\USERNAME\WINUSER\TEMP, you would use the
  statement SET TEMP=x:\username\winuser\temp. Each user must have a
  personal TEMP directory.

</PRE>- On some diskless workstations, you will not be able to start Windows
<PRE>  in standard mode unless you have a TEMP environment variable set or
  you have added a swapdisk entry in the [NonWindowsApp] section of
  the SYSTEM.INI file. For more information about the swapdisk entry,
  see the SYSINI.WRI file.

</PRE>- If you are running a peer-to-peer network, you may not be able to
<PRE>  format a floppy disk by using File Manager. You can use the format
  command at the MS-DOS prompt instead.

</PRE>- Some networks ship with their own copies of files that are included
<PRE>  with Windows version 3.1. Usually Windows includes a newer version,
  and upgrades the one provided with the network when you run Setup.
  However, if you install the network after installing Windows 3.1,
  some network installation programs will overwrite the newer file
  provided with Windows with their own, older version. This older
  version may lack features provided in the newer version, or it may
  not function properly with Windows 3.1. You should back up your
  network and Windows files before upgrading your network software. If
  problems occur, you may need to restore the previous version of some
  files.

</PRE><h3>2.0  Notes About Specific Networks</h3>
 
<P>
This section contains information about specific networks. The
networks are listed in alphabetical order by vendor. If your network
is not listed here, it may be based on or equivalent to one of the
networks listed here. For example, many networks are based on
Microsoft LAN Manager.
<P>
<P><h3>2.1  3Com Networks</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows part of Setup recognizes the following 3Com networks:
<P>
- The 3Com 3+Share network is based on the Microsoft Network product
<PRE>  and will be handled as such by Windows. See the "Microsoft Network
  and Compatibles" section later in this document.

</PRE>- The 3Com 3+Open LAN Manager network is based on Microsoft LAN
<PRE>  Manager and will be handled as such by Windows. See the "Microsoft
  LAN Manager Networks" section later in this document.

</PRE>When you install for 3Com 3+Share or 3Com 3+Open LAN Manager, Setup
adds the following entries to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI
file:
<P>
TimerCriticalSection=10000
UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
PSPIncrement=5
<P>
See SYSINI.WRI for more information on these entries.
<P>
In addition:
<P>
- Some copies of 3Com 3+Open LAN Manager version 1.1 require a
<PRE>  maintenance upgrade to work with Windows. If you encounter problems,
  contact your network customer-support organization.

</PRE>- When you install Windows, Setup modifies your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to
<PRE>  make sure the Windows directory appears in your path ahead of any
  conflicting directories. However,  the 3+Share network might change
  this path when you log in. If so, your system administrator must
  modify the network log-in procedure so that the path is set
  correctly to run Windows.

</PRE>- On a 3Com 3+Open network, the user's name displayed by Windows Print
<PRE>  manager might not match the user's actual log-in name.

</PRE>- Some 3Com 3Station diskless workstations come with an All
<PRE>  ChargeCard. Make sure your machine is not configured to load the
  network into the upper memory area between 640K and 1 megabyte, as
  this will not work reliably with Windows version 3.1 in standard
  mode. You will not be able to set up Windows if your system is
  configured in this way.

</PRE>- If you use the 3C505 Network Adapter Card, you must disable the Link
<PRE>  Plus Optimizer to run Windows in 386 enhanced mode. You can disable
  it by removing the following lines from your CONFIG.SYS file:

  device=psh.sys &lt;arguments&gt;
  device=pth.sys

  In addition, remove the following line from your AUTOEXEC.BAT (or
  any other batch file you use to start your network):

  ldr

  Windows does not support the 3Com network aliasing scheme (three-
  part names).

</PRE><h3>2.2  Artisoft LANtastic</h3>
 
<P>
LANtastic versions below 3.0 are not compatible with Microsoft
Windows.
<P>
For information about LANtastic versions 3.x or 4.x, see the specific
sections that follow. The following notes apply to both versions.
<P>
- The EMMExclude setting, added to the SYSTEM.INI file during Setup,
<PRE>  is required for the default configuration of the Artisoft LANtastic
  Enhanced 2mbps network adapter. If you have changed the memory
  address setting on your adapter, modify this entry in SYSTEM.INI to
  reflect the appropriate address range. If you are not using this
  network adapter, you can remove this entry.

</PRE>- Some commands require the NetHeapSize entry in the SYSTEM.INI file
<PRE>  to be set higher than the default value; for example, xcopy requires
  NetHeapSize=128. Increasing the NetHeapSize value leaves less memory
  available for non-Windows applications, so only increase this value
  if necessary. For more information about the NetHeapSize entry, see
  the SYSINI.WRI file.

</PRE>- You cannot create a permanent swapfile while running Windows on a
<PRE>  LANtastic server. To create a permanent swapfile, restart your
  computer without loading the server software, and create the
  swapfile in Windows. If a dialog box appears asking you to restart
  Windows, you must restart Windows in 386 enhanced mode before you
  start the server software.

</PRE>- If you are running a LANtastic server, you cannot use Windows File
<PRE>  Manager to format a floppy disk. You can use the format command at
  the MS-DOS prompt instead.


</PRE><h3>2.2.1  Artisoft LANtastic 3.x</h3>
 
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with LANtastic 3.x, the following
entries are added to the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI:
<P>
EMMExclude=D800-DFFF
INDOSPolling=TRUE
NetHeapSize=76
NetAsynchFallback=TRUE
NetAsynchTimeout=50
<P>
In addition:
<P>
To print from any mode of Windows across LANtastic 3.x, it is
necessary to
do one of the following:
<P>
- Turn off the Fast Printing Direct To Port option in Control Panel.
<PRE>  To do this, choose the Printers option in Control Panel, and then
  choose the Connect button. In the Connect dialog box, clear the Fast
  Printing Direct To Port check box.

  When you turn off this option, it affects all of your ports.

</PRE>If you want to turn this option off for one port only, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>If you are printing using LPT3, add the following entry to the
   [ports] section of the WIN.INI file:
<P>
   LPT3.DOS=
<P>
   If you are using LPT1 or LPT2, you can use the LPT1.DOS or
   LPT2.DOS entries already in your WIN.INI file.

<P><LI>Quit Windows, and then redirect the LPTx.DOS port (where x is the
   port you are using) by using the LANtastic net use command.

<P><LI>Restart Windows.

<P><LI>Using Control Panel, change your printer port to LPTx.DOS.
<P>
</OL>- If you are running LANtastic version 3.x, you cannot run Windows in
<PRE>  386 enhanced mode on a non-dedicated server.

</PRE></OL>- If you have a network connection on LPT1, it will not be displayed
<PRE>  in Print Manager or Control Panel.

</PRE><h3>2.2.2  Artisoft LANtastic 4.x</h3>
 
When you set up Windows for use with LANtastic 4.x, the following
entries are added to the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI:
<P>
EMMExclude=D800-DFFF
NetAsynchFallback=TRUE
NetAsynchTimeout=50
NetHeapSize=64
PerVMFiles=0
<P>
In addition:
<P>
- If you set up Windows for use with LANtastic 4.x, you must have the
<PRE>  LANTASTI.386 file somewhere on your path. This file should be
  located in your LANtastic directory. If LANTASTI.386 is not in your
  path, the Windows part of Setup adds *dosnet to the [386Enh] section
  of the SYSTEM.INI. To use Windows with LANtastic 4.x, remove this
  entry and add the entries shown above, and make sure LANTASTI.386 is
  somewhere on your path.

</PRE><h3>2.3  Banyan VINES</h3>
 
<P>
Setup will correctly handle the following Banyan VINES versions:
<P>
- Banyan VINES 4.0 is compatible with Microsoft Network and will be
<PRE>  handled as such by Windows.

</PRE>- Banyan VINES 4.1 and later come with additional Windows components,
<PRE>  which are installed when you set up Windows for use with Banyan
  VINES 4.1.

</PRE>See the following sections for information about running these
versions of
VINES with Windows.
<P>
Note: You should start VINES and log in before starting Windows.
Banyan does not support logging in while Windows is running. If you
start Windows when the network is not loaded or you are not logged in,
you will receive one or more error messages indicating that you will
not be able to use VINES functions from within Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>2.3.1  Banyan VINES 4.0x</h3>
 
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with Banyan VINES 4.0x, the following
entries are added to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>        TimerCriticalSection=5000
        UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
        PSPIncrement=5

</PRE>See SYSINI.WRI for more information on these settings.
<P>
- To use Windows printing functions with VINES 4.0, you must have
<PRE>  VINES 4.00(5) or later and must have the NetBIOS support loaded. If
  you cannot print to a network printer, ask your network
  administrator to verify that you are loading NetBIOS and that you
  are running the proper version of VINES.

</PRE>- If you are running VINES 4.0 with Windows running in 386 enhanced
<PRE>  mode and want to run non-Windows applications that use NetBIOS, you
  must install VINES 4.00(5) or later. In addition, you will need to
  start NetBIOS before starting Windows.

  If you start VINES NetBIOS support before starting Windows in
  standard mode, you may not be able to start any non-Windows
  applications. If you have this problem, load NetBIOS from within
  Windows, or contact your Banyan dealer for more information.

</PRE>- Versions below site-specific patch 0H will not support Windows
<PRE>  running in 386 enhanced mode.

</PRE>- If you are running VINES version 4.0x and you have a problem with
<PRE>  print jobs that time-out intermittently, you can either update to
  VINES 4.1x, or use the VINES SETPRINT utility to remove the timeout
  on your printer port by specifying the following:

     SETPRINT lptn servicename /D:INFINITE

  Lptn is the printer port and servicename is the name of the network
  print queue.

</PRE><h3>2.3.2  Banyan VINES 4.1x</h3>
 
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with Banyan VINES 4.1, the following
entries are added to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>        Network=*dosnet, *vnetbios, vvinesd.386
        TimerCriticalSection=5000
        UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
        PSPIncrement=5

</PRE>See SYSINI.WRI for more information on these settings.
<P>
In addition:
<P>
- If you are running VINES 4.10 or 4.11 (below 4.11(5)) and you have
<PRE>  problems printing, you may need to upgrade your VINES.DRV. This
  driver is available from Banyan.

</PRE>- If you are running Banyan VINES 4.10 or 4.11, you do not need to
<PRE>  load NetBIOS unless you are running NetBIOS-specific applications.
  (It is not required for printing, as it is with VINES 4.0x.)

  If you are running version 4.10 and you want to run NetBIOS-specific
  applications with Windows running in 386 enhanced mode, you must
  start NetBIOS before starting Windows. However, you can only run a
  single NetBIOS application at a time.

  If you are running version 4.11, you can load NetBIOS either before
  starting Windows or after starting Windows in 386 enhanced mode.

  If you want to run NetBIOS with Windows running in standard mode,
  you must load NetBIOS from within Windows.  If you load NetBIOS
  before starting Windows, you will not be able to start any
  non-Windows applications.

  For more information on running memory-resident applications after
  starting Windows, see Chapter 7, "Non-Windows Applications," in the
  Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

</PRE><h3>2.4  DEC Pathworks</h3>
 
<P>
Windows version 3.1 supports DEC Pathworks versions 4.0 and above.
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with a DEC Pathworks network, the
following entries are added to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI
file:
<P>
Network=*dosnet, decnet.386, decnb.386
TimerCriticalSection=10000
<P>
For more information about these settings, see the SYSINI.WRI file.
<P>
In addition:
<P>
- DEC Pathworks supports additional API that are not supported by the
<PRE>  files installed by Windows 3.1.

</PRE>- If you have problems starting Windows, or copying or opening files,
<PRE>  you may need to increase the value of the FILES= command in your
  CONFIG.SYS file. Try setting the value to 30.

</PRE>- If you have problems running NetBIOS applications, try replacing the
<PRE>  decnb.386 entry with *vnetbios in the network=  line in the [386Enh]
  section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

</PRE><h3>2.5  IBM OS/2 LAN Server</h3>
 
<P>
IBM OS/2 LAN Server, which is also known as IBM DOS LAN Requester,
is based on Microsoft LAN Manager. Windows supports LAN Server
versions 1.2 and higher.
<P>
- LAN Server versions 1.2 and 1.3 are equivalent to Microsoft Network
<PRE>  and are handled as such by Windows.

</PRE>- LAN Server version 1.3 CSD 5015 or higher is equivalent to Microsoft
<PRE>  LAN Manager version 2.0 and is handled as such by Windows.

</PRE>- LAN Server version 2.0 comes with its own Windows components which
<PRE>  are automatically used by the Windows part of Setup.

</PRE>In addition:
<P>
- If the network Browse functions in Windows File Manager and Control
<PRE>  Panel do not show all the available servers, you may need to
  increase the LAN Server /NVS option. You can do this by adding the
  following line to the DOSLAN.INI file in your LAN Server directory:

  /NVS:1

  Set the value to a number at least as large as the number of servers
  in your domain.

</PRE>- If you want to receive pop-up messages while working in Windows,
<PRE>  make sure the following lines are included in the DOSLAN.INI file in
  your LAN Server directory:

  /NMS:2
  /RCV
  /POP

  The value of /NMS may be set higher but must be a minimum of 2.

  You must also make sure the entry load=WinPopup is included in the
  [windows] section of your WIN.INI file.

</PRE><h3>2.5.1  IBM LAN Server 1.2 and 1.3</h3>
 
<P>
- Running Windows with LAN Server 1.3 with CSD 5015 or later requires
<PRE>  the files LANMAN.DRV, LANMAN.HLP, WINPOPUP.EXE, WINPOPUP.HLP,
  NETAPI.DLL, and PMSPL.DLL. These files should be located in your LAN
  Server directory. If your version of LAN Server does not provide
  these files, the Windows part of Setup will copy them to your
  Windows SYSTEM directory.

</PRE>- LAN Server versions below 2.0 do not allow you to use the IBM OS/2
<PRE>  LAN Server aliasing scheme from inside Windows applications.

</PRE>- LAN Server versions below 2.0 do not allow you to log on through
<PRE>  Windows Control Panel. Doing so may cause your machine to lock up.
  Always log on at an MS-DOS prompt, either before starting Windows or
  while Windows is running.

</PRE>- Windows includes updated versions of the NETAPI.DLL and
<PRE>  PMSPL.DLL files shipped with LAN Server. These files are installed
  during Setup for versions 1.3 with CSD 5015 or higher.

</PRE><h3>2.5.2  IBM LAN Server 2.x</h3>
 
<P>
- Running Windows with LAN Server version 2.x requires the files
<PRE>  LANSRV.DRV, LANSRV.HLP, WINDLR.DLL, NETAPI.DLL, PMSPL.DLL,
  WINPOPUP.EXE, and WINPOPUP.HLP be located on your path. These files
  should be located in your LAN Server directory.

</PRE><h3>2.6  IBM PC LAN Program</h3>
 
<P>
The IBM PC LAN Program is based on the Microsoft Network product
and will be handled as such by Windows.
<P>
When setting up Windows for use with IBM PC LAN Program, the
following entry is added to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI
file:
<P>
INDOSpolling=TRUE
<P>
See the online document, SYSINI.WRI, for more information on this
setting.
<P>
In addition:
<P>
- When you connect to a network share by using File Manager, that
<PRE>  redirection will not be detected by non-Windows applications.

</PRE>- The IBM PCLP Extended Services refers to network drives and printers
<PRE>  by two different names. Usually, when connecting to a network, you
  select connections from a list containing descriptive names, but
  internally connections are made using hidden names such as
  \\SERVER\IBMXS001.

  With PCLP Extended Services, you must type the same name as the
  hidden names in Control Panel or File Manager to make new network
  connections. Consult your network administrator to learn the proper
  names to use.

</PRE>- Some versions of PCLP lock up your system if you receive a broadcast
<PRE>  message while running Windows. You can disable these messages with
  the net pause messenger command. Or you can start up your network
  with net start rdr instead of net start rcv or net start msg
  commands.

</PRE>- When you connect to a network printer by using Control Panel, the
<PRE>  connection will not be detected by non-Windows applications. It
  will, however, still be usable by Windows and Windows applications.

</PRE><h3>2.7  Invisible Software - NET/30 For Windows</h3>
 
<P>
To use NET/30 For Windows, choose the Custom Setup option when you
run Setup. For your network configuration, choose Other Network
(Requires disk from OEM). You are prompted for a path to the directory
containing your NET/30 files. Your SYSTEM.INI and WIN.INI files will
automatically be updated.
<P>
If you are setting up Windows on a nondedicated file server and you
are sharing a serial printer, you must add a line to the SYSTEM.INI
file. If you are sharing COM1, add the following line in the [386Enh]
section:
<P>
COM1AutoAssign=0
<P>
If you are sharing COM2, add the following line to the [386Enh]
section:
<P>
COM2AutoAssign=0
<P>
<P><h3>2.8 Microsoft LAN Manager Networks</h3>
 
<P>
Many networks, such as IBM LAN Server, Digital Pathworks, and 3Com
3+Open are based on Microsoft LAN Manager. Consult your network
documentation, network distributor, or system administrator to learn
whether your network belongs in this category, and if so, on which
version of LAN Manager it is based.
<P>
The following notes include general information about using LAN
Manager networks and information about specific versions of LAN
Manager.
<P>
<P><h3>2.8.1  Using the Ungermann-Bass XNS Transport Stack</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using the Ungermann-Bass XNS transport stack and running
Windows in 386 enhanced mode, you must make sure the transport stack
is not using expanded memory. If your system is configured to provide
expanded memory with a memory manager such as EMM386, you can disable
that product's expanded-memory option. Or, if you want to continue
using expanded memory, you can disable its use by the Ungermann-Bass
transport stack as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Open your PROTOCOL.INI file by using a text editor such as Windows
   Notepad. PROTOCOL.INI is located in your LAN Manager directory.

<P><LI>Find the section [XNS_XIF].
<P>
   If you're using Notepad, you can find this section by choosing Find
   from the Search menu, typing [XNS_XIF], and then choosing the OK
   button.

<P><LI>Add a line NOEMM, or, if the line already exists, make sure that it
   is not commented out with a semicolon (;) at the beginning of the
   line.

<P><LI>Save your PROTOCOL.INI file.

<P><LI>Restart your workstation.
<P>
</OL><h3>2.8.2  Using LAN Manager and Expanded Memory</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode, it is recommended
that you not use expanded memory with LAN Manager. If you do, you may
find that your system slows down considerably or it may lock up
occasionally. If this is a problem, turn off the use of expanded
memory by modifying your LANMAN.INI and PROTOCOL.INI files. The exact
procedure will vary depending on what components you are running. See
your LAN Manager documentation for further details.

<OL><P><LI>Open your LANMAN.INI file by using a text editor such as Notepad.
   LANMAN.INI is located in your LAN Manager directory.

<P><LI>Find or add the section [workstation].
<P>
   If you're using Notepad, you can find this section by choosing Find
   from the Search menu, typing [workstation], and then choosing the
   OK button.

<P><LI>Find or add the lim= line in this section, and then add the
   following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      lim=no
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save your LANMAN.INI file.

<P><LI>Restart your workstation.
<P>
</OL>Or you can stop your workstation and restart it again using the net
stop workstation and net start workstation commands.
<P>
In addition, you may want to configure other network components (such
as protocol stacks) to avoid using expanded memory. Consult your
network documentation for the specific component for instructions on
how to do this.
<P>
<P><h3>2.8.3  Using Pop-up Services</h3>
 
<P>
LAN Manager Enhanced includes pop-up services you can use to see
incoming broadcast messages. These pop-up services can disrupt the
Windows screen display, so you must either disable them or run the LAN
Manager WinPopup utility so they can coexist with Windows.
<P>
The WinPopup utility should be located in your LAN Manager NETPROG
directory, included in your path. To automatically start the utility
when you start Windows, include the following entry in the [windows]
section of your WIN.INI:
<P>
load=winpopup.exe
<P>
If you set up Windows for use with LAN Manager version 2.0 or 2.1
Enhanced, the Windows part of Setup adds this line to your WIN.INI
file. If you are running LAN Manager 1.x Enhanced, you must insert
this line yourself. See WININI.WRI for information on modifying your
WIN.INI file. If you are using LAN Manager 1.x, you also need to
obtain an updated version of NETPOPUP.EXE from your network dealer.
<P>
Note: Windows version 3.1 includes an updated version of the WinPopup
utility. This utility may not be compatible with all networks that are
based on Microsoft LAN Manager. If you are running AT&amp;T/NCR StarGroup
LAN Manager version 2.0 Release 3.5, you should use the WNETMSG
utility provided instead of WinPopup.
<P>
Alternatively, if you want to disable the pop-up services, use the
following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Find your LAN Manager root directory.

<P><LI>Use Notepad to open the LANMAN.INI file, and locate the line that
   begins with wrkservices=.

<P><LI>Remove the netpopup or minipop entry from this line.
<P>
   If you remove the netpopup and minipop entries but leave the
   messenger entry, messages will still be received but will be
   recorded in the MESSAGES.LOG file in your LAN Manager directory
   rather than being displayed on the screen. If you do not want to
   log your messages, you can also remove the messenger entry from
   this same line.

<P><LI>Save the file.

<P><LI>Quit Windows, and then restart your workstation.
<P>
</OL><h3>2.8.4  LAN Manager Basic</h3>
 
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with LAN Manager Basic (all versions),
the following entry is added to the [386Enh] section of your
SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
network=*dosnet, *vnetbios, lanman10.386
<P>
See the SYSINI.WRI file for more information on this entry.
<P>
Network software based on LAN Manager Basic, or on LAN Manager
Enhanced without full API support, must not be loaded in the high
memory area (the first 64K of extended memory).
<P>
You need to modify the LANMAN.INI file in your network directory to
prevent the network from loading in the HMA. Find all lines that begin
with redir and add the following command-line option to each:
<P>
/HIMEM:NO
<P>
<P><h3>2.8.5  LAN Manager 1.x</h3>
 
<P>
Some early copies of LAN Manager 1.x require a maintenance upgrade to
run with Windows. If you experience problems, contact your network
vendor for an upgrade.
<P>
2.8.6  LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced, the
following entry is added to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI
file:
<P>
network=*vnetbios, *dosnet
<P>
See the SYSINI.WRI file for more information on this entry.
<P>
For Windows to support LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced, you must have the
files NETAPI.DLL, PMSPL.DLL, LANMAN.DRV, LANMAN.HLP,
WINPOPUP.EXE, and WINPOPUP.HLP. These files are located in your
LAN Manager NETPROG directory, which should be in your path.
Windows also includes updated versions of these files, which will be
automatically installed on some older versions of LAN Manager.
<P>
<P><h3>2.8.7  LAN Manager 2.1 Basic</h3>
 
<P>
If you upgrade from an earlier version of LAN Manager Basic to version
2.1 Basic using the Over-the-Network Upgrade process, your SYSTEM.INI
and WIN.INI files may be left with incorrect information. This will
only happen if your upgrade procedure has been configured to update
Windows installations.
<P>
This problem will cause you to receive a warning that "WinPopup"
cannot be found, and all network functions in Windows File Manager,
Print Manager, and Control Panel will be unavailable.
<P>
To correct this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI> Open your WIN.INI file by using a text editor such as Notepad.
<P><PRE>    WIN.INI is located in your Windows directory.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Find or add the load= line in the file.
<P>
<P><PRE>    If you're using Notepad, you can find this section by choosing
    Find from the Search menu, typing load=, and then choosing the OK
    button.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Remove the word WinPopup or WinPopup.exe from this line.

<P><LI> Save your WIN.INI file.

<P><LI> Quit Windows.

<P><LI> Change to the Windows directory.

<P><LI> Start Windows Setup by typing setup at the MS-DOS prompt.

<P><LI> Choose the Network entry to display a list of network options.

<P><LI> Choose the option Microsoft LAN Manager (version 2.1 Basic).

<P><LI>Choose to accept the configuration shown.

<P><LI>Restart Windows.
<P>
</OL><h3>2.8.8  LAN Manager 2.1 Enhanced</h3>
 
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with LAN Manager 2.1 Enhanced, the
following entry is added to the [boot] section of your SYSTEM.INI
file:
<P>
Network.drv=lanman21.drv
<P>
See the SYSINI.WRI file for more information on this entry.
<P>
For Windows to support LAN Manager 2.1 Enhanced, you must have the
files NETAPI.DLL, PMSPL.DLL, LANMAN21.DRV, LM21_W31.HLP,
WINPOPUP.EXE, and WINPOPUP.HLP. These files are usually located in
your LAN Manager NETPROG directory, which is on your path. If
Windows cannot find any of these files, you may receive warning
messages when starting Windows, or be unable to use Windows network
functions.
<P>
<P><h3>2.9  Microsoft Network and Compatibles</h3>
 
<P>
If a network is present and detected, but cannot be identified during
Setup, the Microsoft Network is the default network that may be set
up. The following notes apply to the general category of networks that
support the MS-DOS network interface and NetBIOS protocols.
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with Microsoft Network, the following
entries are added to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
TimerCriticalSection=10000
UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
PSPIncrement=5
<P>
For some networks, you may be able to remove one or more of these
entries to improve performance. For more information about these
entries, see the SYSINI.WRI file.
<P>
In addition:
<P>
- If the path to your network software is not included in the path in
<PRE>  your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, Setup does not detect a network and proposes
  "No Network Installed" for your system configuration. Use Custom
  Setup to specify that the Microsoft Network is installed.

</PRE></OL>- Due to the way some networks handle print queues, Print Manager
<PRE>  cannot distinguish multiple print queues on the same server. The
  lists of print jobs in these queues might be displayed improperly.
  In addition, Print Manager might not be able to display the job
  title when displaying queue information.

</PRE>- The Microsoft network driver does not support any vendor's name-
<PRE>  aliasing scheme.

</PRE><h3>2.10  Novell NetWare</h3>
 
<P>
Windows version 3.1 includes updated versions of several Novell
NetWare files that are required to run with Windows 3.1. If you are
running Novell NetWare, the Windows part of Setup will copy the
following files to the SYSTEM subdirectory of your Windows directory
(or the shared network directory if you set up a shared copy of
Windows by using setup /n).
<P>
NETX.COM (version 3.26)
IPX.OBJ (version 3.10)
TBMI2.COM (version 2.1)
IPXODI.COM (version 1.20)
LSL.COM (version 1.21)
<P>
Before running Windows you may need to do the following:
<P>
- Replace your current NetWare shell with the NETX.COM provided (if
<PRE>  your current NetWare shell is older than the version provided).
  Windows 3.1 requires that the NetWare shell components on your
  workstation (such as NET5.COM) be version 3.01 or higher. You can
  use these shell components even if your servers are running older
  versions of NetWare (as early as NetWare 2.10).

  Your current shell may have one of the following names:

  NET3.COM        XMSNET3.EXE     EMSNET3.EXE
  NET4.COM        XMSNET4.EXE     EMSNET4.EXE
  NET5.COM        XMSNET5.EXE     EMSNET5.EXE
  NETX.COM       XMSNETX.EXE     EMSNETX.EXE

  NETX.COM will run on MS-DOS versions 3.1 or higher. The EMS and
  XMS versions of the shell are available from your Novell dealer and
  the Microsoft Windows Driver Library (WDL). For information about
  ordering the WDL, see the Windows and MS-DOS Getting Started
  manual.

  Note: The EMS NetWare shells (EMSNETX.EXE, etc.) are not supported
  when Windows is running in 386 enhanced mode.

</PRE>- If you are running Novell IPXODI.COM and LSL.COM, you need to
<PRE>  upgrade these to versions 1.20 or higher. Use the files provided
  with Windows and copy them from the SYSTEM subdirectory of your
  Windows directory (or your shared network directory) to the
  directory where your existing versions are located.

</PRE>- To run Windows in standard mode, load the TBMI2.COM memory-
<PRE>  resident utility when running Windows. Novell recommends that you
  create a batch file that will load this utility, start Windows, and
  then unload the utility when you quit Windows. The batch file could
  be named RUNWIN.BAT and look like this:

  TBMI2
  WIN
  TBMI2 /U

  TBMI2 enables you to safely run applications that use the NetWare
  IPX and SPX functions in standard mode Windows or the MS-DOS 5.0
  task switcher.

</PRE>- If you are running Novell IPX.COM, you need to have your system
<PRE>  administrator build you a new version using the IPX.OBJ provided
  with Windows.

</PRE>In addition:
<P>
- If you enable 32-bit disk access and you are running the XMS shell
<PRE>  rather than one of the standard NetWare shells (NETX.COM, etc.), you
  can further improve performance by setting the OverlappedIO entry in
  the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file to on.

</PRE>- Do not try to log in, log out, attach, or detach a Novell server
<PRE>  from MS-DOS Prompt within Windows. You should log in before starting
  Windows, and attach or detach servers by using File Manager or the
  Printers option in Control Panel.

</PRE>- If you experience problems starting applications while running
<PRE>  Windows or Windows applications from a file server, make sure you
  are not running the MS-DOS SHARE utility. Current versions of the
  NetWare shell are not fully compatible with SHARE.

</PRE>- If you have a Western Digital Ethercard Plus and have problems
<PRE>  accessing drives by using the MAP ROOT command, contact Western
  Digital for an updated driver.

</PRE>- By default, NetWare gives you access to only 40 files at a time.
<PRE>  When you are running applications with Windows, you can exceed this
  limit rather quickly. If so, you might see unexpected error
  messages. To increase the file access limit, add the following line
  to your SHELL.CFG file:

  file handles = 60

  You should also add the following to your CONFIG.SYS file:

  files = 60

</PRE>- If you get unusable output when printing to a NetWare server (such
<PRE>  as incorrect fonts, garbled text, invalid page breaks, or blank
  lines), you may need to edit your print-job configuration. Try using
  the NetWare PRINTCON utility to set the Auto Endcap and Enable
  Timeout options to No.

</PRE>- When running Windows in 386 enhanced mode, swapping to a drive on a
<PRE>  NetWare 286 server might make starting Windows take up to a minute.
  See Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows," in the Microsoft Windows
  User's Guide for information about controlling the location of your
  swap file.

</PRE>- A NetWare file server does not include the directory entries dot (.)
<PRE>  and double dot (..) as MS-DOS does. However, the NetWare shell
  (version 3.01 or higher) can emulate these entries when applications
  attempt to list the files in a directory. If you have problems
  listing files or deleting directories, turning on the Show Dots
  feature will help. Add the following line to your SHELL.CFG file:

  show dots = on

  Turning on Show Dots will cause problems with earlier versions of
  some 286-based NetWare utilities, such as BINDFIX.EXE and
  MAKEUSER.EXE. Make sure you upgrade these utilities if you upgrade
  your NetWare shell. For more information, contact your Novell
  dealer.

</PRE>- Redirected drives can look different in Windows than they did
<PRE>  without Windows. For example, a device mapped as
  FileServerName/Volume:Directory will appear in Windows as
  FileServerName/Volume:\, showing the root of the file server's
  shared volume, rather than the subdirectory you expected. You can
  correct this with the MAP ROOT entry explained in the following
  information.

</PRE>- In some cases, Windows applications may change the default directory
<PRE>  on a drive. This might cause problems if, for example, your path
  includes the current directory on a network drive (that is, your
  path includes a drive letter without a specific directory, such as
  z: instead of z:\system).

  You can prevent this problem by using MAP.EXE and LOGIN.EXE
  versions 3.0 and later to set up fake roots, or by choosing the MAP
  ROOT function when mapping a connection in File Manager. This
  feature simulates the MS-DOS subst command, which sets the root of a
  given drive to a directory designated by the user instead of to the
  true root of the volume.

  For example, suppose you normally mapped drive F to the HOME\TERRI
  directory on the SERVER\SYS volume, and then included F: in your
  path. You would do this by including the following command in your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file or by typing the command before starting Windows:

  map f:=count\sys:home\terri

  The default directory on drive F would then be HOME\TERRI. To
  prevent Windows from changing this, you would replace the command
  above with the one shown below:

  map root f:=count\sys:home\terri

  This command would make the directory HOME\TERRI appear to be  the
  root drive F.

</PRE>- If you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode, you can adjust the
<PRE>  way Windows handles your network drive mappings by using the Network
  option in Control Panel.

  Normally, when you quit Windows, all of your drive mappings are
  restored to the way they were before you started Windows, and all
  changes you made inside Windows are lost. If you clear the Restore
  Drives option, the mappings you made inside Windows will remain when
  you quit Windows.

  Typically, each instance of MS-DOS Prompt you start from Windows has
  its own set of drive mappings. Changes you make in one instance do
  not affect another. If you set the NWShareHandles option, drive
  mappings  will instead be global, and changes made in one instance
  of MS-DOS Prompt will affect all other applications. If you are
  running a NetWare 286 server, setting NWShareHandles increases the
  number of workstations that can be connected to the server before
  the server runs out of available connections.

  See the Help available in the Network dialog box in Control Panel or
  more information on these options.

</PRE>- When setting up Windows for use with Novell NetWare, the following
<PRE>  entry is added to the [windows] section of your WIN.INI file:

  load=nwpopup.exe

  This automatically starts the NetWare pop-up utility, which displays
  your incoming broadcast messages.

</PRE>- If you are running Novell NetBIOS, you may need to specify
<PRE>  TimerCriticalSection=10000 in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI
  file.

</PRE>- If you have applications or files that use extended characters
<PRE>  (ASCII characters above 128) and you have problems viewing or using
  them, try adding the following line to your SHELL.CFG file:

     special uppercase = on

</PRE>- When connecting or disconnecting network resources from File
<PRE>  Manager, Print Manager, or Control Panel, pay attention to the state
  of the Permanent check box. If this option is checked when you make
  a connection, the connection is automatically made each time you
  restart Windows. To stop reconnecting, disconnect with the Permanent
  option checked. If the option is not checked when you disconnect,
  the connection is removed for the current Windows session, but is
  reconnected when you restart Windows.

</PRE><h3>2.11  TCS 10Net</h3>
 
<P>
Tiara Computer Systems 10Net (formerly known as DCA 10Net) versions
4.1 and above are compatible with Windows version 3.1. The Windows
part of Setup treats these as Microsoft Network compatible.
<P>
When setting up Windows for use with TCS 10Net, the following entry is
added to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
TimerCriticalSection=10000
<P>
The TimerCriticalSection value may be set lower on some versions of
10Net. For more information about this entry, see the SYSINI.WRI file.
<P>
To set up Windows for use with TCS 10Net version 4.1x with the DCA 1Mb
card, run Custom Setup and choose the TCS 10Net (versions 4.1X with

Windows components that will enhance the functionality available in
Windows File Manager, Control Panel, and Print Manager.
<P>
- You cannot use File Manager to format floppy disks when running
versions of 10Net prior to 5.0.
<P>
<P><h3>2.12  Ungermann-Bass Net/One</h3>
 
<P>
Make sure you choose the proper network option when you set up
Windows.
<P>
- Ungermann-Bass Net/One is based on Microsoft Network. Choose the
<PRE>  Microsoft Network Or 100% Compatible option when running the
  Windows and MS-DOS Setup program.

</PRE>- Ungermann-Bass Net/One LAN Manager is based on Microsoft LAN
<PRE>  Manager. Choose the Microsoft LAN Manager option when running the
