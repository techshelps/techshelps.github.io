<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.00a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Trace Access Pack for Windows, version 3.0a is collection of software
utilities that provides several features to make computers easier to
use for people with motion- or hearing-related disabilities.
<P>
Access Pack for Microsoft Windows consists of three main components:

<UL><LI>A modified keyboard driver, which provides most of the features.

<LI>A modified mouse driver, which is required for the mouse-related
   features.

<LI>The Access Utility (ACCESS.EXE), which is used to adjust various
   options and view online Help. The Access Utility is also required
   if you use the SerialKeys feature.
<P>
</UL>Access Pack comes with three modified keyboard drivers that support
most common keyboards. You must have the proper keyboard driver
installed to use any of the Access Pack features.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the current release, the Access Pack mouse driver supports only the
Microsoft PS/2-style mouse, IBM PS/2 mouse, and those 100-percent
compatible with such mice. It does not support the Microsoft BallPoint
mouse.
<P>
<P><h3>If You Can't Install the Mouse Driver</h3>
 
<P>
If you can't install the Access Pack mouse driver, you can use most of
the Access Pack features, but the MouseKeys and SerialKeys features
are unavailable and you cannot run the Access Utility to customize
settings or view online Help.
<P>
If you try to run the Access Utility with improper mouse or keyboard
drivers, the following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Call to Undefined Dynalink

</PRE>For more information on this error, query on the following words in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   windows and "call to undefined dynalink"

</PRE><h3>If You Have an Unsupported Mouse</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a mouse that is not supported by the Access Pack mouse
driver, install the Access Pack keyboard driver. You can then use the
keyboard-activation hot keys to enable most features. (For example,
you can turn the StickyKeys feature on or off by pressing and
releasing the left SHIFT key five times.) The keyboard-activation
sequences are described in the ACCESS.WRI file provided with Microsoft
Access Pack.
<P>
In this configuration, you cannot run the Access Utility to adjust the
user options. However, you can adjust these option by manually editing
the appropriate entries in the WIN.INI file.
<P>
If you edit WIN.INI entries, refer to the WININI.WRI file or the
Windows Resource Kit for procedures, or query on the following words
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   winini.wri and access and pack
