The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information contained in this article is taken from the
SYSINI.WRI file contained in the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit for
the Windows operating system version 3.1. The SYSINI.WRI
file may be viewed with Windows Write.
<P>
The [NonWindowsApp] section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains settings
that affect the performance non-Windows applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The [NonWindowsApp] section can contain the following settings:
____________________________________________________________
<P>
CommandEnvSize=&lt;bytes&gt;
<P>
Default:  0 with MS-DOS versions earlier than 3.2.
<PRE>          Otherwise, the value for the /e: parameter in the
          shell= command line in the CONFIG.SYS file.
</PRE>Purpose:  Specifies the size of the COMMAND.COM environment.
<PRE>          Note that running batch files with the extension
          .BAT starts COMMAND.COM, so this setting also
          applies to batch files. The value for this setting
          must be either 0, or between 160 and 32768. A
          value of 0 disables this setting. If the value is
          not valid, it will be rounded up to 160 or down to
          32768. If the value is less than the current size
          of the actual environment, this setting will be
          disabled, as if it were set to 0. If you have
          specified the environment size in a PIF file for
          COMMAND.COM, the PIF file setting overrides this
          setting.
</PRE>To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
<P>
DisablePositionSave=&lt;Boolean&gt;
<P>
Default:  0
Purpose:  When disabled, the position and font used in a
<PRE>          non-Windows applications is saved in the
          DOSAPP.INI file when you quit the application. If
          enabled, the position and fonts used by a non-
          Windows application whose settings have not been
          previously saved in the DOSAPP.INI file will not
          be saved. If enabled, the setting can be
          overridden for each non-Windows application by
          selecting the Save Settings On Exit check box in
          the Font dialog box.
</PRE>To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
<P>
FontChangeEnable=&lt;Boolean&gt;
<P>
Default:  1 on systems that use Windows 3.1 grabbers. 0 on
<PRE>          systems that use Windows 3.00 grabbers
</PRE>Purpose:  Provides the ability to change the fonts when
<PRE>          running non-Windows applications in a window on
          systems that use version 3.00 of the grabbers
          (usually 3.00 display drivers). Windows version 3.1
          of the video grabbers (used in 3.1 display
          drivers) include built-in support for changing
          fonts when running non-Windows applications in a
          Window. If you are using a 3.00 grabber that has
          not been updated to include the ability to change
          fonts and you want to use this feature, enable
          this setting. However, with this setting enabled,
          your screen may lose characters and the cursor may
          change size and positition slightly.
</PRE>To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
<P>
GlobalHeapSize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
<P>
Default:  0
Purpose:  Specifies the size of a buffer in conventional
<PRE>          memory that Windows allocates when running in
          standard mode. This buffer can be used to share
          information among all non-Windows applications
          that are started from Windows. This setting has no
          effect when Windows is running in 386 enhanced
          mode.
</PRE>To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file. (You
<PRE>            should never need to change this setting.)
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
<P>
LocalTSRs=&lt;list-of-TSR-applications&gt;
<P>
Default:  DOSedit, ced
Purpose:  Specifies which terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
<PRE>          programs work properly if they are copied to each
          instance of a virtual machine. When you start
          Windows, it detects any TSR programs that are
          currently running. If the TSR is on the LocalTSRs
          list, Windows will place a copy of the TSR in each
          virtual machine you run. Many TSR's will not run
          properly if they are added to this list. Make sure
          your TSR is fully compatible with Windows and can
          be copied to a virtual machine before adding it to
          the list.
</PRE>To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
<P>
MouseInDOSBox=&lt;Boolean&gt;
<P>
Default:  1 if an MS-DOS mouse driver with the extension
<PRE>          .COM or .SYS that supports the use of a mouse with
          a non-Windows application is loaded. Oherwise, the
          default is 0.
</PRE>Purpose:  Specifies whether the mouse is supported when
<PRE>          running a non-Windows application in a window.
          Mouse support for non-Windows applications running
          in a window is automatically available if you are
          using a Windows 3.1 version of the grabbers. If
          you are using a Windows 3.00 version of the
          grabbers and you want mouse support, enable this
          setting. If you do not want mouse support, disable
          this setting.
</PRE>To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
<P>
NetAsynchSwitching=&lt;0-or-1&gt;
<P>
Default:  0, unless an application is running that supports
<PRE>          the use of the Task Switcher API by the NETBIOS.
</PRE>Purpose:  Specifies whether or not you can switch away from
<PRE>          an application (running in standard mode) after it
          has made an asynchronous network BIOS call. If
          disabled, you cannot switch away from an
          application after it has made an asynchronous
          network BIOS call. Switching away from some
          applications that make  these calls might cause
          your system to fail. Once Windows detects an
          asynchronous NetBIOS call, you cannont switch away
          from the application, even if no more of these
          calls are made. Enable this setting if you are
          sure that the applications you use will not
          receive network messages while they are inactive.
</PRE>To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
<P>
ScreenLines=&lt;number&gt;
<P>
Default:  25
Purpose:  Specifies the number of lines that will be
<PRE>          displayed on the screen when running a non-Windows
          application. An application that specifies a
          different screen mode can override this setting.
</PRE>To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
<P>
SwapDisk=&lt;drive-colon-directory&gt;
<P>
Default:  The directory pointed to by the TEMP environment
<PRE>          variable; if there is no TEMP variable, then the
          default is the root directory of your first hard
          drive (usually labeled C:). If you do not have a
          hard disk, then the default is the root directory
          of your first floppy drive (usually labeled A:).
</PRE>Purpose:  Provides the name of the disk drive and directory
<PRE>          to which Windows running in standard mode swaps
          non-Windows applications.
</PRE>To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
