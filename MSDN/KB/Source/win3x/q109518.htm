1.0 Using Mail
<P>
This section discusses how to use Mail.
<P>
1.1  Frequency of Checking for New Mail and Sending Mail
<P>
The setting in the Options dialog box that determines how often Mail
checks for new messages also determines how often Mail checks the
Outbox for messages to submit to the post office. A message first
waits in the Outbox for the amount of time specified, and then waits
again for the same amount of time until Mail checks for new messages.
For example, if you specified that Mail should check for new messages
every three minutes, it can take up to six minutes before you receive
new mail.
<P>
If it takes longer than you expect to receive your messages, try
specifying a lower value.
<P>
1.2 Sending a Bitmap as an Attachment
<P>
In a mail message, if you include a bitmap that was created with
Paintbrush or another graphics application, the recipient may not be
able to view the bitmap if he or she is using a display adapter that
has a different resolution from yours.
<P>
1.3  Connecting to a Post Office on a Novell NetWare Server
<P>
When you connect to an existing WGPO by using Mail, Mail displays a
network-share browser which enables you to select the network server
and share on which the post office resides. For NetWare servers, you
must have previously attached to the server. Then, in the Network
Path box, you can specify the path to the post office directory.
<P>
1.4  Mail and Protocols
<P>
You must have the Microsoft Windows Network installed to use Mail to
communicate by electronic mail with others in your workgroup. Mail is
not dependent on any particular protocol.
<P>
1.5  Setting Up Mail for Multiple Users on One Computer
<P>
You can set up one computer so that more than one person can use Mail
on it. A separate .MMF file will be maintained for each user on the
Post Office computer. Note that there must be enough disk space
available on the Post Office computer for all inboxes that are stored
there.
<P>
The setup steps should be followed by the Post Office administrator.
For detailed information about the first four steps, refer to Chapter
4, "Mail" and Appendix A, "Maintaining Mail" in the Microsoft
Workgroup Add-On User's Guide.
<P>
To set up a computer for multiple Mail users:

<OL><P><LI>Set up the Workgroup Post Office. The Post Office must be set up on a
   different computer.

<P><LI>Set up the accounts for each user, rather than having each user set up
   his or her own account.

<P><LI>Start Mail and logon using the mailbox name of the most frequent user.
   The first account created is the default account name used when
   starting Mail.

<P><LI>In the Welcome to Mail dialog box, select Connect to An Existing
   Postoffice.

<P><LI>From the Mail menu, select Options.

<P><LI>Select the Server button.

<P><LI>In the Storage section, check the Postoffice check box, and then choose
   OK.

<P><LI>From the Mail menu, select Exit and Sign Out.
<P>
   One user can now use Mail.

<P><LI>Logon to Mail as each user, and repeat steps 5 through 8.
<P>
</OL>Once setup is complete, anyone who has been added by the administrator can
logon to Mail. The logon dialog box will display the mailbox name of the
first account created, so other users will need to type their mailbox name.
All users on the shared computer must Exit and Sign Out each time they
leave Mail.
<P>
<P>
2.0 Managing the Mail System Files
<P>
Each user and the WGPO has two Mail system files:
<P>
<PRE>   The message file: MSMAIL.MMF

   The Mail file: MSMAIL.INI

</PRE></OL>The message file, MSMAIL.MMF, stores messages, message folders, and
the Personal Address Book. This file is updated as messages are
received.
<P>
The Mail file, MSMAIL.INI, controls the way Mail works.
<P>
Your MSMAIL.MMF and MSMAIL.INI files are located in the directory
where you set up Windows for Workgroups (the default is C:\WINDOWS).
<P>
When you create a WGPO or connect to a post office, these files are
automatically modified as described below. You need to edit the Mail
system files only when you want to change functionality or restore
these files to a particular state. For example, if you set up a WGPO
and then delete it, you need to modify your MSMAIL.INI file to
connect to a different post office.
<P>
2.1 Changes Made to Files When You Connect to a WGPO
<P>
When you connect to a WGPO, the following occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   The following commands are added to the [Microsoft Mail] section
   of your MSMAIL.INI file, which is in the Windows directory:

      ServerPath=\\computername\sharename
      Login=mailbox_name

   A message file is created for you. The default name is MSMAIL.MMF.

</PRE>2.2 Recreating the Mail Initialization Procedure
<P>
When you first run Mail, you are given the option to connect to an existing
post office or create a new post office. After you make your selection, you
cannot go back and change your selection. Use the following procedure if
you chose to set up a new post office, and you did not want to.
<P>
To reinitialize the Mail initialization procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Open the MSMAIL.INI file in an ASCII text editor, such as Notepad.

<P><LI>Disable the ServerPath= and the login= lines by typing a semicolon (;)
   at the beginning of each line.

<P><LI>Add or edit the CustomInitHandler= line so that it appears as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CustomInitHandler=WGPOMGR.DLL,10
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run Mail. The initialization procedure begins.
<P>
<P>
</OL>2.3  Backing Up the MSMAIL.MMF File
<P>
Since the MSMAIL.MMF file contains all your messages, you should back
it up regularly. For instructions on backing up and restoring the
MSMAIL.MMF file, see the Microsoft Workgroup Add-On User's Guide.
<P>
In some circumstances, Mail may encounter problems in the MSMAIL.MMF
file and you will be asked if you want Mail to repair the file.  If
you choose Yes, Mail makes a backup copy of the MSMAIL.MMF file in
the Windows directory or in the directory specified by the MailTmp
parameter in the MSMAIL.INI file. Each time the file is repaired, a
new backup file is created. The first such backup file will be named
MSMAIL.BAK, and subsequent backup files will be named MSMAIL.001,
MSMAIL.002, and so on. You can delete these backup files.
<P>
2.4  Backing Up the MSMAIL.INI File
<P>
In general, you don't need to modify your MSMAIL.INI file; however,
you might want to restore it to a given state or alter it so that you
can change the way Mail works. If you do change your MSMAIL.INI file,
you should make a backup first.
<P>
Important: After altering the MSMAIL.INI file, you must restart Mail
for the changes to take effect.
<P>
To back up your MSMAIL.INI file:

<OL><P><LI>In the Main group, choose the File Manager icon.

<P><LI>Select your MSMAIL.INI file. It is in the directory where you set up
   Mail (the default is C:\WINDOWS).

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Copy.

<P><LI>In the To box, type a name for your backup file for example,
   MSMAIL.OLD.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>To restore your MSMAIL.INI file, you can rename a backup copy, if you have
one, or you can edit your existing MSMAIL.INI file. How you edit the file
depends on whether you created a WGPO or connected to one.
<P>
2.5 Restoring the MSMAIL.INI File
<P>
To restore your MSMAIL.INI file after creating a WGPO:
<P>
If you made a backup copy of your MSMAIL.INI file, rename it as
MSMAIL.INI, and move it to the directory where you set up Mail (the
default is C:\WINDOWS).
<P>
If you don't have a backup copy, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Remove the following lines from the [Custom Commands] section of your
   MSMAIL.INI file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      WGPOMgr1=3.0;Mail;;13
      WGPOMgr2=3.0;Mail;&amp;Postoffice Manager...;14;
      WGPOMGR.DLL;0;;Manage Workgroup Postoffice;MSMAIL.HLP;2870
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove the following lines from the [Microsoft Mail] section of the
   MSMAIL.INI file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ServerPath=drive:\directory
      Login=mailbox_name
</PRE><P>
</OL>2.6  Creating and Accessing Other Message Files
<P>
You can create message files in addition to your primary message file by
using the Backup command or the Export Folders command.
<P>
To access these files, use the /f option to include the name of the file in
the Mail command line, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   msmail.exe  /f  filename

</PRE></OL>Mail starts offline, and then opens the specified message file instead of
your primary message file. To revert to your primary message file, start
Mail without using the /f option.
<P>
<P>
<P>
3.0 Managing a Workgroup Post Office
<P>
3.1  Workgroup Post Office Share Names
<P>
The share name defined for a WGPO should not be longer than eight
characters, and must not include spaces.
<P>
3.2 Compressing Shared Folders
<P>
When compressing shared folders in the Postoffice Manager, the
administrator should ensure that the shared folders are not being
used by Mail users.
<P>
3.3 Postoffice Manager and the Post Office Administrator
<P>
Postoffice Manager is the program used by the post office
administrator to administer the WGPO. By default, Postoffice Manager
is installed on the computer of the person who creates the WGPO.
<P>
3.4 Changes Made to Files When You Create a WGPO
<P>
When you create a WGPO, the following occurs in the administrator account:
<P>
<PRE>   The WGPO directory is created in the specified location.

   The following commands are added to the [Custom Commands]
   section of the MSMAIL.INI file (which is in the Windows directory):

      WGPOMgr1=3.0;Mail;;13
      WGPOMgr2=3.0;Mail;&amp;Postoffice Manager...;14;
      WGPOMGR.DLL;0;;Manage Workgroup Postoffice;MSMAIL.HLP;2870

   The Postoffice Manager command is added to the Mail menu on the
   computer from which the WGPO was created. The commands appear only on
   the Mail menu on this computer. To run Postoffice Manager on another
   computer, you must add the commands to the MSMAIL.INI file on that
   computer and delete them from the original computer.

   The following commands are added to the [Microsoft Mail] section
   of the MSMAIL.INI file:

      ServerPath=drive:\directory
      Login=mailbox_name

   A message file is created for the administrator account. The
   default filename is MSMAIL.MMF.


</PRE>3.5 Workgroup Post Office Must Be at the Root of Share on Server
<P>
If you create a WGPO on a Microsoft Windows NT, LAN Manager, or
similar network server, you must define a share on that server that
has the WGPO directory as its root. When users run Mail to connect to
a post office on the network, they can select only a post office that
resides in the root of the share, not one in a subdirectory of the
share.
<P>
3.6  Setting Up a Post Office on Another Computer
<P>
The WGPO can be set up on another computer across the network.
For the following procedure, assume these conditions are true:
<P>
<PRE>   The post office is set up and administered from computer 1, a
   Windows for Workgroups computer. The user on computer 1 is the post
   office administrator. Postoffice Manager runs on computer 1.

   The post office files are actually kept on computer 2, a computer
   with server/sharing capabilities such as one running Windows for
   Workgroups, Windows NT, LAN Manager, or Novell NetWare.

</PRE>NOTE: Novell servers require some special attention. Refer to the
"Creating a WGPO on a Novell NetWare Server" section in this file.
<P>
To set up a post office on another computer, the designated
administrator of the WGPO should carry out the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>On computer 1, from the Main group, start Mail.

<P><LI>Choose Create A New Workgroup Postoffice.

<P><LI>To connect to computer 2, choose the Network button.
<P>
</OL>If computer 2 is running Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT, or is a LAN
Manager server, type the server name and share name (\\server\share) where
you want the post office created, and then choose the OK button. You must
have access rights to the server and the share.
<P>
If computer 2 is a Novell server, you must be logged onto the Novell server
and have the correct permissions. Then, connect to the server and use one
of these conventions:
<P>
<PRE>   server/share:directory
   \\server\share\directory
   remapped drive:\directory

</PRE><P><LI>After the WGPO is established, check to ensure that it is shared
   properly on computer 2.
<P>
<P>
</OL>3.7 Changing the Post Office Administrator
<P>
You can transfer WGPO administrator responsibilities from one person
to another. In this procedure, the following conventions are used:
<P>
<PRE>   Admin1 is the current Post Office Administrator.
   Admin2 will become the new Post Office Administrator.

</PRE></OL>The following fields are required:
<P>
<PRE>   Name:
   Mailbox:
   Password: (You must know the passwords for Admin1 and Admin2.)

</PRE>To change administrators:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the MSMAIL.INI file from the WGPO computer to a floppy disk so
   that you can use it later when establishing the Admin2 account.

<P><LI>From Admin1's computer, sign on to Mail, select the Mail option, then
   select Postoffice Manager.

<P><LI>Select the Details option, and write down the required information for
   Admin1 and Admin2 (obtain the passwords from the Administrators;
   passwords don't appear in the details dialog box).

<P><LI>Admin1 should delete the user account for Admin2 and edit the details
   of the Admin1 account so that it matches the new Post Office
   Administrator's account (Admin2).

<P><LI>Open Admin1's MSMAIL.INI file in a text editor (such as Notepad) and
   remove the following lines from the end of the [Custom Commands]
   section:
<P>
<P><PRE>       WGPOMgr1=3.0;Mail;;13
       WGPOMgr2=3.0;Mail;&amp;Postoffice Manager...;14;
       WGPOMGR.DLL;0;;ManageWorkgroup Postoffice;MSMAIL.HLP;2870
</PRE>
<P><LI>Admin1 should exit and sign out of Mail.

<P><LI>On Admin2's computer, open the MSMAIL.INI file that was copied to the
   floppy disk. Using a text editor (such as Notepad) cut the following
   lines from this file:
<P>
<P><PRE>       WGPOMgr1=3.0;Mail;;13
       WGPOMgr2=3.0;Mail;&amp;Postoffice Manager...;14;
       WGPOMGR.DLL;0;;ManageWorkgroup Postoffice;MSMAIL.HLP;2870
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    Then, paste these lines into the [Custom Commands] section of
    Admin2's MSMAIL.INI file (located in the Windows directory). Be sure
    that these lines are the last lines in the [Custom Commands] section.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the changes made to the MSMAIL.INI file, then start Mail.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: A message may appear that states Mail was unable to find your .MMF
file. A dialog box then appears that displays the .MMF file that was
detected. Select the detected .MMF file and then choose the OK button.

<OL><P><LI>Open Mail and select the Mail option to verify that Postoffice
   Administrator is now available on Admin2's computer.
<P>
</OL>10.If necessary, create a user account for Admin1.
<P>
3.8 Changing the Name of Your Workgroup Post Office
<P>
Before you rename your WGPO, inform members of your workgroup that they
will not be able to exchange messages until they reconnect to the renamed
WGPO.
<P>
To rename your WGPO:

<OL><P><LI>Ask all people in your workgroup to quit and sign out of Mail.

<P><LI>In the Main group, choose the File Manager icon.

<P><LI>Select the WGPO directory.

</PRE>
<P><LI>If your shared directory has a password, you need to delete or edit the
   line specifying the password for the shared directory.

<P><LI>Inform people in your workgroup of the new name, and ask them to edit
   the following line in the [Microsoft Mail] section of their MSMAIL.INI
   file to reflect the new name of the WGPO:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ServerPath=\\computername\sharename
</PRE><P>
</OL>They may also need to delete or edit a line specifying a password for the
shared directory.
<P>
3.9 Moving Your Workgroup Post Office
<P>
You may need to move your WGPO to a different directory for example,
if the computer on which you set up the WGPO runs out of disk space.
Before you move your WGPO, inform people in your workgroup that they
will not be able to exchange messages until they reconnect to the
relocated post office.
<P>
To move your WGPO:

<PRE></PRE>        WGPOMGR.DLL;0;;Manage Workgroup Postoffice;MSMAIL.HLP;2870

</PRE></OL>4.0 Using Mail with Other Message Systems
<P>
To connect a workgroup post office to another workgroup post office,
you must purchase Microsoft Mail Postoffice Upgrade for Windows for
Workgroups for each post office. To connect to another message
system, such as X.400 or SMTP, the Microsoft Mail Postoffice Upgrade
is required, as well as the gateway software which enables the two
message systems to exchange information.
<P>
Each message system can connect to the workgroup post office by using
one or more specific gateways. The following table is a partial list
of the Microsoft gateways needed for various message systems. If you
use one of the message systems listed in this table, you need to
purchase the appropriate gateway.
<P>
Additional gateways that use the Microsoft Mail File Format API may
also be available. If you are interested in a message system or
gateway that is not listed, contact your local Microsoft subsidiary.

</PRE>5.0  Creating Schedule+ Resources
<P>
To create a Schedule+ resource (for a conference room, overhead
projector, or other shared equipment), the Post Office Administrator
must do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Create a Mail account for that resource by using the Postoffice Manager
   command on the Mail menu.

<P><LI>Exit and sign out of Mail.

<P><LI>Sign in to Mail and Schedule+ by using the mailbox name and password
   that correspond to the resource.

<P><LI>From the Schedule+ Options menu, choose the General Options command.

<P><LI>Select "This account is for a resource," and then choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Quit Mail and Schedule+ by choosing Exit &amp; Sign Out from the Schedule+
   File menu.
<P>
</OL>If you will be setting up resources from a computer that is used by another
Mail account, this process will require you to sign in as multiple Mail
users on the same computer. Resources do not receive mail, so in most cases
there is no need to maintain separate message files for them. Therefore, if
you are setting up resources on a computer that is used by only one other
mail user (or no other mail users), set the passwords for all the accounts
on that computer to be the same. You will be able to sign in as any of the
accounts.
