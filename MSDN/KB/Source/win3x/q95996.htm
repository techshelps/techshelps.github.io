The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the differences between Windows for Workgroups
Mail and Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Workgroup postoffice architecture is similar to the architecture
for Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0. This is so users with
connectivity needs beyond their workgroup can easily upgrade.
<P>
The postoffice structure and Windows client are identical except for the
following:

<UL><LI>No Demo files are in the workgroup postoffice. Microsoft Mail for PC
   Networks does include these files.

<LI>There is no spell checker with Windows for Workgroups Mail. The spell
   checker is supplied with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

<LI>The postoffice in Windows for Workgroups does not support connections
   to external postoffices or gateways. For example, a Windows for
   Workgroups postoffice cannot connect to another postoffice or
   gateway.

<LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks includes support for global aliases
   or network group names while Windows for Workgroups Mail does not.

<LI>The default ADMIN.TPL and ADMIN.INF files in Windows for Workgroups
   Mail are created with predefined user information in the workgroup
   postoffice. For example, the user templates included in Windows for
   Workgroups Mail contain template information regarding Phone number
   #1, Phone number #2, Office, Department, and Notes. These must be
   created separately in Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

<LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks includes an administration program not
   created in Windows for Workgroups Mail. In Windows for Workgroups,
   the administration program is accessed via the Mail menu in the
   Windows Mail client.

<LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks includes an administration utility
   that is used to administer and configure the postoffice. The
   ADMIN.EXE program can be used to configure and administer the
   postoffice from any workstation on the network running MS-DOS. In
   Windows for Workgroups, the administration program is accessed via
   the Mail menu in the Windows Mail client. Only the administrator can
   log on under his or her account and administer the postoffice on
   the workstation only.

<LI>The Mail client included with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version
   3.11 is designed to work with Microsoft At Work PC Fax. However, At
   Work Fax is not supported with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for
   Windows.
