The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you exit Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, you receive the following
error message on a blue screen:
<P>
<PRE>   This application was communicating on the network when you
   terminated it. Although Windows attempted to restore the
   state of the network, you may have problems with network
   communications until you restart your computer.

          Press any key to continue

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you do one of the following:

<UL><LI>You run Microsoft Mail.
<LI>You run After Dark 1.0a.
<LI>You run NetWare NETBIOS.EXE when Windows for Workgroups is configured
   with Novell NetWare as an additional network.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using After Dark, you can work around this problem by removing
After Dark from your Startup group. Otherwise, change the following line in
the [Microsoft Mail] section of the MSMAIL.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   [Microsoft Mail]
   NetBios=0 (instead of NetBios=1)

</PRE>NOTE: NetBios=0 disables the automatic new mail notification. You must
manually check for new mail.
<P>
If you are running Windows for Workgroups with Novell NetWare as an
additional network, you can work around this problem by removing the
NETBIOS.EXE from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and installing IPX/SPX Compatible
Transport or "IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with NetBIOS" as an additional
protocol.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
