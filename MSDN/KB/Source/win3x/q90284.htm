The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups permits two levels of access to a shared
directory or ClipBook page:

<UL><LI>Read-Only Access

<LI>Full Access
<P>
</UL>Each type of access may have a password associated with it, and the
type of access granted to a client depends on which password he/she
provides. This article discusses how Windows for Workgroups handles
the password caching for dual-password shares.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Password caching is implemented differently for two-password shares.
If the password typed for a two-password share was cached and
retrieved the same way as other passwords, a client who knows both
passwords would be confined to a single type of access because the
password cache would prevent any further password prompts and
therefore any chance of typing the other password.
<P>
When Windows for Workgroups restores a persistent connection to a
two-password share, it is assumed that the last type of access used is
the one desired. If a password for the resource is present in the
cache, Windows for Workgroups uses it and does not prompt you for
input.
<P>
If you make an explicit connection (made from the Connect Network
Drive dialog box) to a two-password share, Windows for Workgroups
gives you the option of typing the other password for the resource. If
a password was found in the password cache, it is filled in as a
suggested password to use (it is displayed as asterisks). You can
accept that password or type a different one.
<P>
If one of the passwords is blank, Windows for Workgroups still prompts
you for a password. This gives you the opportunity to type the
nonblank password. If you type nothing, Windows for Workgroups
connects you to the share with the blank password.
<P>
NOTE: To disable password caching and prevent your PWL file from being
accessed, add the following line to the [NETWORK] section of the System.ini
file:
<P>
<PRE>   PasswordCaching=no
</PRE>
