The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information on the following known usage problems
with Microsoft Windows, PC Tools, and the Microsoft Mouse driver:

<UL><LI>Mouse problems with PC Tools version 7.0
<LI>Mouse problems with PC Tools version 6.0
<P>
</UL>PC Tools is manufactured by Central Point Software.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>MOUSE PROBLEMS WITH PC TOOLS VERSION 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
PC Tools version 7.0 may not work correctly with Microsoft Mouse driver
versions 7.0, 7.03, and 7.04. Central Point product support technicians
have noted various problems when using these two driver versions and
recommend updating to Microsoft Mouse driver version 8.0 or later.
<P>
The 7.04 driver (with the "/Y" switch) works in most instances, although
you may encounter some problems with certain system configurations.
<P>
Central Point product support reports no known problems with the 6.24b
driver and PC Tools.
<P>
The reported problems may result because some portions of PC Tools conflict
with the increased file size of the 7.0 and 7.03 drivers. Changing to the
earlier mouse driver, 6.24b, may free 10 to 15K of additional memory in the
contested address space of RAM.
<P>
<P><h3>MOUSE PROBLEMS WITH PC TOOLS VERSION 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
PC Tools version 6.0 may have problems running with a Microsoft mouse
during or after a Windows session. To correct this problem, you can do one
of the following:

<UL><LI>Add the "/M:PS2" parameter to HIMEM.SYS.
<LI>Remove the"/Y" parameter from the mouse driver.
<LI>Run FIXMOUSE.BAT and FIXWIN.BAT.
<P>
</UL>Each of these steps is described more fully in the following paragraphs.
<P>
<P><h3>Adding The "/M:PS2" Parameter</h3>
 
<P>
Adding the "/M:PS2" parameter to the HIMEM.SYS reference line in the
CONFIG.SYS file may resolve this problem. For example, the reference
to HIMEM.SYS in the CONFIG.SYS file should read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=C:\HIMEM.SYS /M:PS2

   -or-

   DEVICE=C:\HIMEM.SYS /M:2

</PRE><h3>Removing the"/Y" Parameter from the Mouse Driver</h3>
 
<P>
If your computer does not have a Video Seven graphics card, removing
the "/Y" parameter from the MOUSE.SYS line in the CONFIG.SYS file may
also resolve this problem. The "/Y" parameter on the mouse driver
helps resolve problems (relating to loss of mouse cursor control) with
a Video Seven graphics card.
<P>
<P><h3>Run FIXMOUSE.BAT and FIXWIN.BAT</h3>
 
<P>
Central Point Software has created FIXMOUSE.BAT and FIXWIN.BAT to correct
the problems. These batch files are available from Central Point Software
customer service or from the Central Point bulletin board service (BBS).
<P>
When you run an MS-DOS based application or exit Windows, the port
designated for the mouse is reset. Windows does a soft reset on the port
that most MS-DOS-based applications are able to use. Some of these
applications, including PC Tools, require a hard reset on the port to use
the mouse. Central Point Software has created FIXWIN.BAT and FIXMOUSE.BAT
to provide a hard reset on the mouse port.
<P>
Running FIXWIN.BAT starts Windows. When you exit, it calls FIXMOUSE.BAT,
which does a hard reset and sends a command string out to the mouse port.
