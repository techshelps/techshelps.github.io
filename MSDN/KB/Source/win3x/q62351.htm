The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article outlines the hard disk controller and drive configurations
that are supported under Microsoft Windows version 3.0, and the steps that
may be taken to maximize Windows version 3.0 hard disk compatibility.
<P>
Windows version 3.0 supports the hard disk controller and drive
combinations that were available as standard configurations in the
supported computers at the time Windows version 3.0 was initially shipped
(May 22, 1990). Supported computers are machines specifically listed in the
"Windows 3.0 Hardware Compatibility List." A copy of the compatibility list
is included in the Windows version 3.0 retail package.
<P>
Additionally, a supported controller and drive combination should be
partitioned exclusively with the FDISK utility included with the DOS
supplied with the supported computer. Third-party partitioning
utilities may cause problems.
<P>
MS-DOS and PC-DOS versions up to 4.00 do not support hard disks with more
than 1024 cylinders. Windows version 3.0 requires MS-DOS to be compatible
with your hardware, so it shares this limitation. Some nonstandard hard
disk controllers attempt to translate a hard disk with more than 1024
cylinders into an apparent 1024-cylinder hard disk. Many such controllers
do not provide 100-percent compatibility.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Real or Standard Mode Compatibility</h3>
 
<P>
Windows version 3.00 real and standard modes should not experience
problems with any type of hard disk controller and drive combination.
If you experience hard disk problems under real or standard modes,
this points to a bad controller, one that is not compatible with your
other hardware, or some other cause. Contact your hardware
manufacturer for further assistance in this case.
<P>
<P><h3>Enhanced Mode Compatibility</h3>
 
<P>
Windows version 3.00 enhanced mode without SMARTDrive loaded supports
only standard ST506 and ESDI controllers. To use enhanced mode with
SCSI or other nonstandard devices, it is necessary to load SMARTDrive
for proper operation.
<P>
When enhanced mode detects the presence of SMARTDrive, it directs all
disk access requests from itself and all applications through SMARTDrive.
This enables SMARTDrive to function effectively as a double-buffering hard
disk device driver, and eliminates most compatibility problems.
<P>
Even if SMARTDrive is loaded, in some configurations you may experience
hard disk access errors such as the following:
<P>
<PRE>   "Cannot Read from Drive C:"
   "Cannot Write to Drive C:"
   "Drive C: Not Ready Error"

</PRE>In this case, you should insert the following line under the [386ENH]
section of the SYSTEM.INI configuration text file:
<P>
<PRE>   [386Enh]
   VirtualHDIRQ=off

</PRE>This line is not case-sensitive. Synonyms for "off" include "no", "0",
and "false".
<P>
If you are still experiencing hard disk problems under Windows version 3.0
with SMARTDrive loaded and virtualHDIRQ=off, contact your manufacturer for
further assistance. This is the highest level of hard disk compatibility
that may be achieved with Windows version 3.0.
