<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Schedule+ for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 is not identical to the full
retail version of Schedule+. The differences between these versions of
Schedule+ are listed below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<UL><LI>The retail version of Schedule+ provides two independent setup programs.
   One installs the client software and the other provides administration
   of accounts on the post office. Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Schedule+
   installs as a part of the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Setup or through
   the Add/Remove Components option available when you choose the Windows
   Setup icon.

<LI>The retail version of Schedule+ provides administrative services for
   direct file storage and connections between post offices. Windows for
   Workgroups 3.11 Schedule+ does not supply file administrative services
   because each user creates his or her calendar data file (*.CAL) on the
   post office automatically when Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Schedule+
   runs.

<LI>The retail version of Schedule+ provides access to multiple post offices
   using a data-transfer program that communicates with multiple Mail 3.0
   post offices. Windows for Workgroups 3.11 does not provide this
   functionality. Windows for Workgroups 3.11 supports one post office and
   a maximum of 500 users.

<LI>The retail version of Schedule+ provides an extensive online help
   demonstration of its features. This feature is not included in the
   Windows for Workgroups 3.11 version of Schedule+.
