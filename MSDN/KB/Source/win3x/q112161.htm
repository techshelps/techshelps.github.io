<P>
<P><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the 3Com EtherLink(R) III (3c509) network interface card (NIC)
and a 3Com ODI MLID (3C509.COM or 3C5X9.COM) with Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 and Novell(R) NetWare(R) is installed as your secondary
network, your system may:

<UL><LI>Stop responding (hang) when you copy large files across the network.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Inadvertently lose network connections.
<P>
</UL>The WG1004 disk included with this Application Note contains an updated
MSODISUP.386 file that corrects both of these problems. The updated file
correctly adjusts the counter for the number of outstanding packets to be
copied off the NIC after the MLID fails to copy an incoming packet off the
NIC.
<P>
The updated file allows you to successfully use multiple 3Com NICs with
Windows for Workgroups. The updated file ensures that all adapter names are
available for binding when multiple ODI drivers are loaded. For example,
you can now have the 3c503 and 3c509 drivers loaded so that you can run two
NICs on separate networks or send one protocol to one NIC and a different
protocol to another NIC.
<P>
NOTE: Although you can use multiple different NICs, you cannot use more
than one of the same NIC. For example, you can use a 3c503 NIC and a 3c509
NIC, but you cannot use two 3c503 NICs.
<P>
The WG1004 disk included with this Application Note contains an updated
NETWORK.INF file that corrects binding entry errors with the 3Com EtherLink
III 3c5x9 driver. The updated NETWORK.INF uses MLID=*:3C5X9.COM instead of
MLID=*:3C509.COM.
<P>
<P><h3>To install the updated files</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>Make a backup copy of the currently installed MSODISUP.386 file by
   typing the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then pressing
   ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;path&gt;\msodisup.386 msodisup.old
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;path&gt; is the location of your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory.
<P>
   For example, if your Windows directory is called WINDOWS and is on drive
   C, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren c:\windows\system\msodisup.386 msodisup.old
</PRE>
<P><LI>Repeat step 2, but substitute NETWORK.INF for MSODISUP.386 and
   NETWORK.OLD for MSODISUP.OLD. For example, if your Windows directory is
   called WINDOWS and is on drive C, type the following at the MS-DOS
   command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren c:\windows\system\network.inf network.old
</PRE>
<P><LI>Insert the enclosed WG1004 disk in the appropriate floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>To copy the MSODISUP.386 and NETWORK.INF files to the Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
   press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:*.* &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the WG1004 disk and
   &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory of your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory.
<P>
   For example, if the WG1004 disk is in drive A and your Windows directory
   is called WINDOWS and is on drive C, type the following at the MS-DOS
   command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:*.* c:\windows\system
</OL></PRE>
