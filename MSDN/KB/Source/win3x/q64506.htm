The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When running under Windows, the Mouse Systems Bus Mouse should be set
to an interrupt level (IRQ) of 2 to 7. You may experience erratic
operation if the bus card is set for an IRQ higher than IRQ 7, or for
an IRQ that the system is already using. (According to Mouse Systems
technical support, the bus mouse can be configured for IRQ 2 to 15.)
<P>
In addition, to ensure compatibility with Windows, be sure that your
Mouse Systems MS-DOS mouse driver is version 7.0 or later.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a list of devices and the IRQ numbers that they
commonly use. Be sure that your mouse setting does not conflict with
any other devices you may be using:

   AT/386 hard disk controller       2
   COM2 (serial port 2)              3
   COM1 (serial port 1)              4
   PC/XT hard disk controller        5
   LPT2 (parallel port 2)
   LPT1 (parallel port 1)            7

</PRE><h3>Update Your Mouse Systems Driver for Windows 3.0, 3.0a</h3>
 
<P>
You may need to update your Mouse Systems mouse drivers to run Windows
3.0 or 3.0a successfully. Mouse Systems provides an application on its
bulletin board (BBS) called WIN3DRV.EXE, which is a self-extracting
file that copies all the files you need to drive A.
<P>
After you download the WIN3DRV.EXE file from the BBS:

<OL><P><LI>Run Setup from the WINDOWS directory, and choose Other for the
   mouse section of Setup.

<P><LI>Follow the directions on the screen to load the correct Windows 3.0
   mouse driver.
<P>
</OL>For further information, please call Mouse Systems technical support.
