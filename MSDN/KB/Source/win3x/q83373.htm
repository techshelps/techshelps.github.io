The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to install MicroSpeed PC-Trackball pointing
devices for use with Windows 3.0.
<P>
These devices can be operated properly when the "Microsoft or IBM PS/2
mouse driver" option is selected while setting up Windows.
<P>
More Information:
<P>
The MicroSpeed PC-Trackball has four interfaces:

<UL><LI>Serial
<LI>PS/2 mouse port
<LI>Microsoft InPort mouse port
<LI>Bus card
<P>
</UL>Of the four interfaces, the bus card interface is the only one not
currently recommended for use with Windows 3.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the PC-Trackball with Bus Card Interface</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the MicroSpeed PC-Trackball with the bus card interface,
you cannot use Windows 3.0 standard or 386 enhanced mode. If you start
Windows 3.0 in standard or 386 enhanced mode with this device, the
logo screen will briefly appear and then Windows will return to the
MS-DOS command prompt. Windows runs correctly in real mode with this
bus card.
<P>
To work around this problem, connect the PC-Trackball to one of the
serial ports and select "Microsoft or IBM PS/2 mouse driver" as the
pointing device during Windows setup.
<P>
MicroSpeed is aware of this problem and is working on a new driver.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the PC-Trackball Serial, InPort, and PS/2 Mouse Port</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Connect the PC-Trackball to the proper port. Do not install any
   MicroSpeed mouse drivers. If these drivers have been installed,
   edit the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Look for the names
   PPR.SYS, PPR.COM, and POINTER.BAT and remove them.

<P><LI>If the PC-Trackball is replacing a Microsoft or PS/2 mouse, install
   for a Microsoft or PS/2 mouse.

<P><LI>If Windows 3.0 is not installed, run the Windows 3.0 Setup program
   and follow the instructions for installing Windows for use with a
   Microsoft or PS/2 mouse.

<P><LI>If you are planning to use the PC-Trackball with non-Windows
   applications, install the Microsoft mouse driver version 7.04 or
   later in either the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The Windows 3.0
   Setup program may do this. If it does not, use the Windows
   EXPAND.EXE utility located on Disk 2 of the Microsoft Windows 3.0
   disk to decompress the MOUSE.SY$ file into the root directory as
   MOUSE.SYS and then edit the CONFIG.SYS file and add the following
   line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      device=c:\mouse.sys /y
</PRE><P>
</OL>Note: MicroSpeed's KEYMAP.COM program should not be used when running
Windows 3.0.
<P>
