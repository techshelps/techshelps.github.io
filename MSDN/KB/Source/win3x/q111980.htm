</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
When you use the Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 ELNK3.386 driver, your
system may stop responding (hang) when it encounters non-802.3 packets.
This problem typically occurs on extremely congested networks that contain
a variety of packet types, especially non-NetBEUI packets.
<P>
The WG0990 disk included with this Application Note contains a new
ELNK3.386 driver to correct this problem. The new driver correctly handles
unknown packet types in heavy network traffic situations.
<P>
<P><h3>To install the new ELNK3.386 file</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>Make a backup copy of the currently installed ELNK3.386 file by
   typing the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then pressing
   ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;path&gt;\elnk3.386 elnk3.old
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;path&gt; is the location of your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory.
<P>
   For example, if your Windows directory is called WINDOWS and is on
   drive C, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
   press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren c:\windows\system\elnk3.386 elnk3.old
</PRE>
<P><LI>Insert the enclosed WG0990 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive.

<P><LI>To copy the file to the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, type the
   following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\elnk3.386 &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the WG0990 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory of your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory.
<P>
   For example, if the WG0990 disk is in drive A and your Windows
   directory is called WINDOWS and is on drive C, type the following
   at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\elnk3.386 c:\windows\system
</PRE><P>
