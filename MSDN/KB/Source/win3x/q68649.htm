The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience problems running Microsoft Windows version 3.0 in
standard mode. These problems include the following:

<UL><LI>Windows hanging at the logo screen
<LI>Unrecoverable Application Errors (UAEs)
<LI>Windows defaulting to real mode even when you type Win
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps may reduce problems running Microsoft Windows
version 3.0 in standard mode:

<OL><P><LI>Ensure that the system has at least an 80286 processor and has
    enough memory to run in standard mode. You need between 384K to
    512K of combined conventional and extended memory to run Windows
    in standard mode. You should have at least 128K free conventional
    memory and at least 192K free extended memory.

<P><LI>Verify that Windows can run in real mode. If so, you may have
    installed mouse, keyboard, video, or printer drivers designed for
    an earlier version of Windows. These drivers often prevent Windows
    from running in standard mode. Update to the proper Windows 3.00
    driver. If Windows doesn't run in real or standard mode, you may
    have selected the wrong driver or computer type. Reinstall Windows.

<P><LI>Check your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files for TSRs
    (terminate-and-stay-resident programs), sufficient buffers, files,
    and environment space. For more information on troubleshooting
    the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files, query on the following
    words:
<P>
       tshoot and AUTOEXEC.BAT

<P><LI>Verify that Windows 3.00 is correctly installed on the system
   by clicking the Setup icon from the Main group of Program
   Manager. Check that the correct keyboard, pointing device,
   video driver, and network were chosen during setup. Also check
   through the "Microsoft Windows Version 3.00 Hardware Compatibility
   List" to see if your computer requires special handling. If so,
   exit Windows and reinstall, using only minimum drivers (no mouse, no
   network, lower-resolution video driver) with the SETUP/I option.

<P><LI>Disable the autoswitching or autosensing feature on the video
    card if applicable.

<P><LI>Disable RAM shadowing if supported by the system.

<P><LI>Verify that you are using the correct version of DOS for the
    system. You should be using a DOS version 3.10 or later that was
    designed for the machine. For example, do NOT use IBM PC DOS on
    non-IBM computers and vice-versa.

<P><LI>Ensure that HIMEM loads successfully. If not, try ALL A20 handlers
    1 to 8. The CONFIG.SYS file should include the /m:x switch on the
    DEVICE=C:\HIMEM.SYS line, where x denotes a handler from 1 to 8.
    For example, if you are using a PS2, this line should read
    DEVICE=C:\HIMEM.SYS /M:2. Some A20 handlers may lock up your
    computer. As a result, have a bootable DOS floppy disk available in
    case of problems.

<P><LI>Install Windows in a clean directory. Do not install Windows
    version 3.00 over a 2.x version of Windows because some files and
    drivers may not get updated properly.

<P><LI>Confirm that you are using a recent system BIOS. If not, you may
    want to contact the manufacturer for an update.

<P><LI>Some 286 computers may not run Windows in standard mode unless you
    put the statement PadCodeSegments=1 in the [Standard] section of
    the SYSTEM.INI file.
