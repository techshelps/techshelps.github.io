If you have been running WordStar for Windows with Windows version

Windows version 3.1. For example, some elements of the WordStar screen
might not be displayed the same as they were in Windows version 3.0.
<P>
Windows version 3.1 uses descriptive printer-model names for printer
drivers. Because WordStar does not recognize the new names, you need
to update your WordStar templates. Do this by opening a template,
selecting the printer you are using, and then saving the new
information in the template.

software vendor or call Wordstar International, Incorporated, at
