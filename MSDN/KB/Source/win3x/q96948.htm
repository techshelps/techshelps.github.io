The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The 3Com 3C509 network interface card (NIC) has a diagnostic setting to
adjust its use of processor time if a modem is present on the computer. If
a higher modem speed is set (such as 38.4 kilobits per second [Kbps] to
14.4 Kbps) instead of the default value of 9600 bits per second (BPS), the
following problems may occur:

<UL><LI>Loss or lack of network functionality, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>    -- Inability to send packets over the network
    -- Inability to maintain network connections
    -- Inability to be "seen" on the network
</PRE>
<LI>Dropped characters and/or excessive retries with modem connections.

<LI>One of the following error messages may appear after the NET START
   command is executed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Error #5: Access Denied
</PRE><P>
   -or-
<P>
<P><PRE>      Error 5740: The Protocol Manager has reported that a protocol
      has failed initialization
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
If any of the above problems occur, use 3Com's diagnostic utility to
change the modem speed setting. Slower computers should lower the
modem speed settings to 2400, 1200, or No Modem to improve
performance.
<P>
If either of the error message persists, reset the adapter to 9600
BPS support (the default), then soft-boot the computer. If the
message still occurs, set the 3C509 card to No Modem.
<P>
NOTE: On faster computers, there should only be a slight difference
between settings.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
3Com's Etherlink III (3C509) card takes advantage of a new standard in
network adapter architecture known as Parallel Tasking. The adapter
uses Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) and other
advanced components to allow a higher level of integration so that an
adapter can handle multiple tasks per frame. Using this technology,
the 3C509 adapter can use "predictive interrupts" to issue an
interrupt to the CPU when something important is about to happen and
continue to process user data until the CPU actually responds.
Accordingly, the 3C509 card can allocate some of its resources to
affect the maximum modem speed setting, which is on the card. This
setting allows for faster access of a modem on a machine using a
network.
<P>
The modem speed setting tells the adapter how long it can disable
interrupts without causing problems with the serial port. The lower
the modem speed, the longer the adapter can keep interrupts disabled.
Performance issues concerning modem settings are more drastic on
slower computers. The default value setting of 9600 BPS works whether
you have a modem or not, or if the modem is slower than the default.
The modem value should not be changed unless performance problems
result.
<P>
Other setting options that may be modified with the 3C509 adapter
diagnostic utility include the following: I/O Base Address, IRQ, Boot
PROM, Transceiver Type, and Network Driver Optimization. Additionally,
the program contains the option to test the card and display
diagnostic and troubleshooting information files.
<P>
If the maximum modem speed of 38.400 is used, 3Com provides a patch
that replaces the ELNK3.DOS driver in the CONFIG.SYS file. With the
maximum modem setting enabled, this patch will protect against the
PRO0032E error message that may display when the NDIS protocols
attempt to bind at startup (bootup).
<P>
The diagnostic utility (3C509N.ZIP) and the patch file (MAX509.EXE)
may be downloaded from 3Com's bulletin board service by calling (408)
980-8204 or from CompuServe by typing "go Threecom" (without the
quotation marks).
<P>

utility program, contact 3Com technical support at (800) 876-3266.
<P>
The 3C509 network interface card is manufactured by 3Com, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
