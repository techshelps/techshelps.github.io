The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows version 3.1 works correctly with Qualitas 386MAX or BlueMAX
memory managers version 5.1 and later.
<P>
<P><h3>Behavior of Windows Setup</h3>
 
<P>
Windows Setup should detect 386MAX or BlueMAX if they are running when
you install Windows, and Setup should take appropriate action. If you
are running 386MAX or BlueMAX versions 5.1, 5.11, or 5.12, Setup
upgrades several files in your 386MAX or BlueMAX directory. These
files are only used for supporting Windows. The files are 386MAX.VXD,
BLUEMAX.VXD, and WINDOWS.LOD.
<P>
The .VXD files are loaded automatically by 386MAX or BlueMAX when
Windows starts in 386 enhanced mode; they are not needed if Windows is
run in standard mode.
<P>
Windows Setup automatically creates or modifies a 386MAX.PRO file in
your memory manager directory, and makes sure this file instructs the
memory manager to load the WINDOWS.LOD file when the memory manager is
started. It does so by including the line
<P>
<PRE>   LOAD=&lt;path&gt;WINDOWS.LOD"

</PRE>[Bin the profile file. It also makes sure the profile is being used by
ensuring that the line
<P>
<PRE>   PRO=&lt;path&gt;\386MAX.PRO

</PRE>is included on the line in CONFIG.SYS, which starts the memory manager.
<P>
The following sections describe known problems that may occur.
<P>
<P><h3>386MAX or BlueMAX Not Configured for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
When you install 386MAX or BlueMAX, the installation program asks you
whether or not you intend to use Windows. If you answer No, then the
program disables all Windows support features by inserting the NOWIN3
keyword in the 386MAX.PRO file or on the command line in CONFIG.SYS.
<P>
If you later install Windows, you must remove this keyword in order to
let the two programs run at the same time.
<P>
<P><h3>Software Loaded High</h3>
 
<P>
Windows Setup may not be able to detect memory-resident software that
is loaded into upper memory blocks using the Qualitas 386LOAD utility.
<P>
<P><h3>Upgrading from to 386MAX or BlueMax 6.0 or Later</h3>
 
<P>
If you have installed Windows for use with 386MAX or BlueMAX versions
below 6.0, and later upgrade to version 6.0, your memory manager
profile file (normally 386MAX.PRO or BLUEMAX.PRO) still contains the
line to load WINDOWS.LOD at boot time. This is no longer required and
can be removed to free up a small amount of additional memory.
<P>
<P><h3>Qualitas Installation May Install QCACHE Along with SMARTDRV.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
Older versions of the 386MAX or BlueMAX installation programs
recommend installing the QCACHE disk cache even if SMARTDRV.EXE
version 4.0 is already installed. You should never attempt to run two
disk cache utilities at the same time. Disable QCACHE.
<P>
<P><h3>Running ASQ Utility Under Windows</h3>
 
<P>
The Qualitas ASQ utility (similar to Microsoft Diagnostics) is not
compatible with Windows and should not be run while Windows is
running. Doing so may cause your workstation to hang.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the VGASWAP Option with 386 Enhanced Mode</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 386 enhanced mode should work correctly when 386MAX or BlueMAX
VGASWAP options are enabled, provided that you do not set the
UseRomFonts=1 switch in the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI. Using that
setting in conjunction with VGASWAP may cause some full-screen
messages to be drawn incorrectly and be difficult to read.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows May Use B000-B7FF</h3>
 
<P>
By default, Windows 3.1 uses the UMA addresses B000-B7FF. Many
loadhigh managers attempt to also use this area, causing a conflict
with Windows. There are two solutions to this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Exclude the range B000-B7FF with the memory manager.
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>Install MONOUMB2.386.
<P>
   a. Copy and expand the MONOUMB2.38_ file that is on your Windows
<P><PRE>      disk to your Windows SYSTEM directory by typing the following at
      the MS-DOS command prompt:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         expand monoumb2.38_ c:\windows\system

   b. Add the following setting to the [386Enh] section in the
      SYSTEM.INI file:

         device=monoumb2.386

</PRE></OL><h3>386MAX Parameter EXT=0 Not Recommended</h3>
 
<P>
Qualitas 386MAX program has a parameter EXT=0 that may cause problems
with Windows version 3.1. Qualitas does not recommend using this
setting; Windows 3.1 does not support it. Do NOT use this setting.
<P>
If you use this setting, Windows 3.1 fails during Setup and may hang
in standard mode when you exit.
