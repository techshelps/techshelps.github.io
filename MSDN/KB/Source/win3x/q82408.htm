This information applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the following changes that are made to your system
files by Norton Desktop for Windows versions 1.0 and 1.1:

<UL><LI>SHELL= Setting Changed in SYSTEM.INI File
<LI>Device Drivers Installed in the SYSTEM.INI File
<LI>Changes to the AUTOEXEC.BAT File
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>SHELL= Setting Changed in SYSTEM.INI File</h3>
 
<P>
Norton Desktop for Windows can be installed as a shell that replaces
the Program Manager of Windows. To do this, Norton Desktop modifies
the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. To temporarily disable
Norton Desktop, edit the SYSTEM.INI file in a text editor (such as
Microsoft Windows Notepad), and change the line "shell=ndw.exe" so
that it reads "shell=progman.exe" (without the quotation marks).
<P>
<P><h3>Device Drivers Installed in the SYSTEM.INI File</h3>
 
<P>
Norton Desktop for Windows installs three virtual device drivers
(VFINTD, VDMADX, and VNSS) in the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory and places
the following four lines in the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI:
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=VFINTD.386
   DEVICE=VDMADX.386
   DEVICE=VNSS.386
   DMABufferSize=21

</PRE>The following is an explanation of the lines in the [386enh] section
of SYSTEM.INI:
<P>
<PRE>   Lines               Description
   -----               -----------

   DEVICE=VFINTD.386   Virtual Floppy Interrupt Device Driver

   DEVICE=VDMADX.386   Virtual direct memory access (DMA) Device
                       Driver (replaces the default VFINTD, VDMADX,
                       VNSS internal DMA device driver *vdmad)

   DEVICE=VNSS.386     Virtual Screen Saver Device Driver

   DMABufferSize=21    Sets amount of RAM reserved for buffered DMA
                       (default=16)

</PRE>Removing or remarking out these lines causes Windows to exit to the
command prompt when you try to start Windows in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
To remove Norton Desktop for Windows, you need to remove the three
device= lines mentioned above and add the following line to the
[386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=*vdmad

</PRE><h3>Changes to the AUTOEXEC.BAT File</h3>
 
<P>
When you install Norton Desktop for Windows version 1.0 or 1.1, your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file may be modified. Toward the end of the installation
the following choices are given:

<UL><LI>Make changes:
<P>
   The NDW directory will be added to the PATH variable. Erase Protect
   (EP) and IMAGE will be added as well.

<LI>Make changes later:
<P>
   Nothing is changed.

<LI>Make no changes:
<P>
   The Norton Desktop for Windows directory is added to the path. It
   is not added if the PATH has reached its limit of 128 characters.
<P>
   Some versions of Norton Desktop delete the 't' from batch file
   extension so the batch file will not run.
<P>
</UL>Norton Desktop for Windows is manufactured by Symantec Corporation, a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding this product's performance or reliability.
