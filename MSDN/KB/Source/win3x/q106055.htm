<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Multimedia PC (MPC) Specification was published by the Multimedia PC
Marketing Council in 1990 to encourage the adoption of a standard
multimedia computing platform. In May 1993, the MPC Marketing Council
published a new specification called MPC2 (or Level 2 Specification) as an
enhanced multimedia computer standard. The original MPC specification, now
also known as the MPC Level 1 Specification, continues in full effect.
<P>
The appearance of the MPC or MPC2 certification mark on a computer
system or upgrade kit indicates that the hardware meets the
corresponding (Level 1 or Level 2) MPC Marketing Council
specification. Software bearing the Multimedia PC mark has been
designed to work on Multimedia PC licensed hardware.
<P>
By establishing a standardized platform, certifying hardware
compliance, and providing interoperability between software and
hardware for the consumer, the MPC Marketing Council is encouraging
widespread use of multimedia applications and hardware.
<P>
The following chart compares key requirements and recommendations of
the Multimedia PC Level 1 and Level 2 Specifications.

</PRE><h3>Full Functional MPC (Level 1) Specification</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>CPU</h3>
 
<P>
Minimum requirement:  386SX (or compatible) microprocessor
<P>
<P><h3>RAM</h3>
 
<P>
Minimum requirement:  2 megabytes of RAM
<P>
<P><h3>Magnetic Storage</h3>
 
<P>
Requirement: 3.5-inch, high density (1.44-MB) floppy disk drive.
<P>
Minimum requirement: 30-MB hard disk drive.
<P>
<P><h3>Optical Storage</h3>
 
<P>
Requirement: CD-ROM drive with sustained 150kB/second transfer rate;
average seek time of 1 second or less; 10,000 hours MTBF; mode 1
capability (mode 2 and form 1 &amp; 2 optional); MSCDEX 2.2 driver that
implements the extended audio APIs; subchannel Q (subchannels P and
R-W optional--if R-W subchannel support is provided, additional APIs
must be implemented in MSCDEX driver; specifications for these
additional APIs are available from Microsoft).
<P>
The drive must be capable of maintaining a sustained transfer rate of
150kB/sec. without consuming more than 40 percent of the CPU bandwidth
in the process. It is recommended that this capability be achieved for
read block sizes no less than 16K and lead time of no more than is
required to load the CD-ROM buffer with 1 read block of data.
<P>
It is recommended that the drive have on-board buffers of 64K and
implement read-ahead buffering.
<P>
<P><h3>Audio</h3>
 
<P>
Requirement: CD-ROM drive with CD-DA (Red Book) outputs and a front
panel volume control.
<P>
Requirement: 8-bit (16-bit recommended) digital-to-analog converter
(DAC) with linear PCM sampling; DMA or FIFO buffered transfer
capability with interrupt on buffer empty; 22.05 and 11.025 kHz sample
rate mandatory.
<P>
44.1 kHz sampling rate desirable; optional stereo channels; no more
than 10 percent of the CPU bandwidth required to output 11.025 or
22.05 kHz; no more than 15 percent for 44.1 kHz.
<P>
Requirement: 8-bit (16-bit recommended) analog-to-digital converter
(ADC) with linear PCM sampling, 11.025 kHz mandatory, (22.01 kHz, or
44.1 kHz sampling rate optional); DMA or FIFO buffered transfer
capability with interrupt on buffer full; microphone input.
<P>
Requirement: Internal synthesizer hardware with multi-voice,
multi-timbral capabilities, six simultaneous melody notes plus two
simultaneous percussive notes.
<P>
Requirement: Internal mixing capabilities to combine input from three
(recommended four) sources and present the output as a stereo,
line-level audio signal at the back panel. The four sources are: CD
Red Book, synthesizer, DAC (waveform), and (recommended but not
required) an auxiliary input source. Each input must have at least a
3-bit volume control (eight steps) with a logarithmic taper.
<P>
A 4-bit or greater volume control is strongly recommended. If all
sources are sourced with -10dB (consumer line level: 1 milliwatt into
700 ohms=0dB) without attenuation, the mixer will not clip and will
output between 0 dB and +3 dB. Individual audio source and master
digital volume control registers and extra line-level audio sources
are highly recommended.
<P>
<P><h3>Video</h3>
 
<P>
Requirement: VGA-compatible display adapter, and a color VGA-
compatible monitor. A basic Multimedia PC uses mode 12h (640 x 480, 16
colors).
<P>
An enhanced configuration referred to as VGA+ is recommended with
640 x 480, 256 colors.
<P>
The recommended performance goal for VGA+ adapters is to be able to
blit 1, 4, and 8 bit-per-pixel DIBs (device independent bitmaps) at
350K pixels/second given 100 percent of the CPU, and at 140K pixels/second
given 40 percent of the CPU. This recommendation applies to run-length
encoded images and non-encoded images. The recommended performance is
needed to fully support high-performance applications, such as
synchronized audio-visual presentations.
<P>
<P><h3>User Input</h3>
 
<P>
Requirement: Standard 101-key IBM-style keyboard with standard DIN
connector, or keyboard that delivers identical functionality utilizing
key-combinations.
<P>
Requirement: Two-button mouse with bus or serial connector, with at least
one additional communication port remaining free.
<P>
<P><h3>I/O</h3>
 
<P>
Requirement: Standard 9-pin or 25-pin asynchronous serial port,
programmable up to 9600 bits per second (BPS), switchable interrupt
channel.
<P>
Requirement: Standard 25-pin bidirectional parallel port with
interrupt capability.
<P>
Requirement: 1 MIDI port with In, Out, and Thru must have interrupt
support for input and FIFO transfer.
<P>
Requirement: IBM-style analog or digital joystick port.
<P>
<P><h3>System Software</h3>
 
<P>
Multimedia PC system software must offer binary compatibility with
Microsoft Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions or Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Minimum Full System MPC2 (Level 2) Configuration</h3>
 
<P>
Same configuration as Level 1 with all elements and components meeting
MPC2 (Level 2) full functional requirements outlined below.
<P>
Unless all the new MPC2 or Level 2 requirements are included, a system
is considered a Level 1 machine.
<P>
<P><h3>Minimum MPC2 (Level 2) Upgrade Kit Configuration</h3>
 
<P>
Same configuration as Level 1 with all elements and components meeting
MPC2 (Level 2) full functional requirements outlined below.
<P>
<P><h3>Full Functional MPC2 (Level 2) Specification</h3>
 
<P>
The following elements are specific to the Level 2 specification; only
changes and additions from the Level 1 specification are listed. All
other elements from the Level 1 specification are in effect as well for
the Level 2 specification.
<P>
<P><h3>CPU</h3>
 
<P>
Minimum requirement: 25 MHz 486SX (or compatible) microprocessor.
<P>
<P><h3>RAM</h3>
 
<P>
Minimum requirement: 4 megabytes of RAM (8 megabytes recommended).
<P>
<P><h3>Magnetic Storage</h3>
 
<P>
Requirement: 160-MB or larger hard disk drive.
<P>
<P><h3>Optical Storage</h3>
 
<P>
Requirements: CD-ROM drive capable of sustained 300 KB/sec. transfer
rate, average seek time of 400 milliseconds or less, CD-ROM XA ready
(mode 1 capable, mode 2 form 1 capable, mode 2 form 2 capable),
multisession capable.
<P>
At 300 KB/sec. sustained transfer rate it is recommended that no more
than 60 percent of the CPU bandwidth be consumed. It is recommended
that the CPU utilization recommendation be achieved for read block
sizes no less than 16K and lead time of no more than is required to
load the CD-ROM buffer with 1 read block of data.
<P>
<P><h3>Audio</h3>
 
<P>
Requirement: 16-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC), 44.1 kHz sample
rate mandatory, stereo channels; no more than 15 percent of the CPU
bandwidth be required to output 44.1 kHz.
<P>
Requirement: 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with Linear PCM
sampling; 44.1 kHz sample rate mandatory.
<P>
CD-ROM XA audio capability is recommended.
<P>
Support for the IMA adopted ADPCM software algorithm is recommended.
<P>
<P><h3>Video</h3>
 
<P>
Requirement: Color monitor with display resolution of 640 x 480 with
65,536 (64K) colors.
<P>
The recommended performance goal for VGA+ adapters is to be able to
blit 1, 4, and 8 bit-per-pixel DIBs (device independent bitmaps) at
1.2 megapixels/second given 40 percent of the CPU. This recommendation
applies to run-length encoded images and non-encoded images. The
recommended performance is needed to fully support demanding
multimedia applications including the delivery of video with 320 x 240
resolution at 16 frames/second and 256 colors.
<P>
<P><h3>User Input</h3>
 
<P>
No changes from Level 1.
<P>
<P><h3>I/O</h3>
 
<P>
No changes from Level 1.
<P>
<P><h3>System Software</h3>
 
<P>
No changes from Level 1.
