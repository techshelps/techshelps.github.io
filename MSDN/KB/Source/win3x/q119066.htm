The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can create a BOOTLOG.TXT file by typing "win /b" (without the quotation
marks) when you are troubleshooting problems starting Windows or Windows
for Workgroups. The /B switch creates the file in the Windows directory.
You can view BOOTLOG.TXT in a text editor, such as Windows Notepad. This
file includes a list of the basic Windows drivers as they are loaded. If
there is a problem loading a driver, a statement appears in the BOOTLOG.TXT
file indicating which driver could not load.
<P>
NOTE: This switch appends new information to the end of an existing
BOOTLOG.TXT file. Therefore, you may want to rename or delete any existing
BOOTLOG.TXT file in the Windows directory before using the /B switch.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In BOOTLOG.TXT, a line reporting a loading failure appears as follows
<P>
<PRE>   LoadFail = &lt;xxxxxxx.xxx&gt; Failure code is &lt;##&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;xxxxxxx.xxx&gt; is the name of the device that failed to load, and &lt;##&gt;
is the numeric failure code.
<P>
The following is a list of failure codes that may appear in the BOOTLOG.TXT
file and their corresponding descriptions:
