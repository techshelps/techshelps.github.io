The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information about the documentation errors in the
manual "Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit Addendum for
Operating System version 3.11."
<P>
The following topics are covered:

<UL><LI>Page 1-25: 32-Bit Disk Cache
<LI>Page 1-28: ForceLazyOn= Goes in [386Enh] Section, Not [vcache] Section
<LI>Page 4-12: DeferBrowsing= Is Not a Valid Entry
<LI>Page 4-14: LogonDisconnected=Entry in SYSTEM.INI Shows Incorrect
   Default
<LI>Page 4-16: PrintBufTime= Goes in the [IFSMGR] Section
<LI>Pages 4-20 &amp; 4-21: ForceLazyOn= and ForceLazyOff= Go in [386Enh] Section
<LI>Page 4-25: Log= Entry in EFAXPUMP.INI Should Be in [MODEM] Section
<LI>Page 4-28: [Message] Section DeliveryFormat Entry Defined Incorrectly
<LI>Page 5-10: ADMINFCFG.EXE Should Be ADMINCFG.EXE
<LI>Page 8-32, 35, 37: Secondnet.drv=Netware.drv Entry Should Be in [Boot]
   Section of SYSTEM.INI
<LI>Page 8-39: Figure 8.13 Should Not Include ODIHLP.EXE
<LI>Page 8-42: Important Note Is Incorrect for Windows for Workgroups 3.11
<LI>Page 10-4: At Work PC Fax Does Not Route Incoming Faxes
<LI>Page 13-5: Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Startup Switches
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Page 1-25: 32-Bit Disk Cache</h3>
 
<P>
The second sentence of the first paragraph in the 32-Bit Disk Cache section
on page 1-25 states: "VFAT is responsible from reading and writing
information from or to the disk device..."
<P>
The sentence should state: "VFAT is responsible for reading and writing
information from or to the disk device..."
<P>
<P><h3>Page 1-28: ForceLazyOn= Goes in [386Enh] Section, Not [vcache] Section</h3>
 
<P>
Page 1-28 of the Resource Kit incorrectly states ForceLazyOn= goes in the
[vcache] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. It actually goes it the [386Enh]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 4-12: DeferBrowsing= Is Not a Valid Entry</h3>
 
<P>
Page 4-12 of the Resource Kit incorrectly lists DeferBrowsing= as a valid
entry for the [Network] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
The correct entry is DeferBrowse=. DeferBrowsing is not valid and has no
effect on Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 4-14: LogonDisconnected=Entry in SYSTEM.INI Shows Incorrect Default</h3>
 
<P>
The LogonDisconnected= entry in the [Network] section of the SYSTEM.INI
file incorrectly states the default for this setting.
<P>
The correct default is YES.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 4-16: PrintBufTime= Goes in the [IFSMGR] Section</h3>
 
<P>
Page 4-16 of the Resource Kit incorrectly states PrintBufTime= goes in the
[network] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. This entry goes in the [IFSMGR]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file. This section does not appear by default,
you must create it.
<P>
The PrintBufTime= entry goes in BOTH sections.
The PrintBufTime= entry in the [IFSMGR] section controls the network
printing timeout for MS-DOS applications running in an MS-DOS VM under
Windows, using the protected-mode redirector (VREDIR.386).
The PrintBufTime= entry in the [network] section controls the network
printing timeout for MS-DOS applications running outside of Windows
entirely, using the real-mode redirector (NET.EXE).
<P>
<P><h3>Pages 4-20 &amp; 4-21: ForceLazyOn= and ForceLazyOff= Go in [386Enh] Section</h3>
 
<P>
Page 4-20 of the Resource Kit incorrectly states ForceLazyOn= goes in the
[vcache] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. Page 4-21 of the Resource Kit
incorrectly states ForceLazyOff= goes in the [vcache] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file. Both of these entries are valid only in the [386Enh]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 4-25: Log= Entry in EFAXPUMP.INI Should Be in [MODEM] Section</h3>
 
<P>
The Log= entry in the [COMn] section of the EFAXPUMP.INI file has no effect
on the logging of transmission information in the FAXWATCH.LOG file.
<P>
However, if you place the Log= entry in the [MODEM] section of the
EFAXPUMP.INI file, the entry generates a FAXWATCH.LOG file, and the
transmission information is saved to FAXWATCH.LOG after you exit Mail.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 4-28: [Message] Section DeliveryFormat Entry Defined Incorrectly</h3>
 
<P>
The DeliveryFormat=n paragraph incorrectly defines the functionality of the
three valid settings (0, 1, and 2). It also incorrectly defines the
default. The following text is correct:
<P>
<PRE>   DeliveryFormat=n specifies the default delivery format for sending an
   outgoing fax message. A value of 2 indicates that the fax message should
   be sent as a binary message. A value of 1 indicates that the fax message
   should be sent as a rendered Group 3 facsimile transmission. A value of
   0 indicates that the fax message should be sent as email if the
   destination machine supports that type of message, otherwise a Group 3
   facsimile is transmitted. The default is 0.

</PRE><h3>Page 5-10: ADMINFCFG.EXE Should Be ADMINCFG.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
On page 5-10, the command for expanding ADMINCFG.EX_ incorrectly instructs
you to expand it as ADMINFCFG.EXE. The command should read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   expand a:admincfg.ex_ c:\windows\admincfg.exe

</PRE>Page 8-32, 35, 37: Secondnet.drv=Netware.drv Entry Should Be in
[Boot] Section of SYSTEM.INI
 
<P>
The Secondnet.drv=Netware.drv entry is incorrectly shown in the [386Enh]
section of the sample SYSTEM.INI files on pages 8-32, 8-35, and 8-37.
<P>
This entry should be placed in the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 8-39: Figure 8.13 Should Not Include ODIHLP.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
The INI file entries in Chapter 8 are correct, but figure 8.13 should not
include ODIHLP.EXE.
<P>
NDIS2SUP provides the ODI layer through ODINSUP NDIS 3.0 protocols.
ODIHLP.EXE would cause problems as both ODIHLP.EXE and ODINSUP.COM would
attempt to grab the same frames.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 8-42: Important Note Is Incorrect for Windows for Workgroups 3.11</h3>
 
<P>
The note labeled "Important" on page 8-42 states the following:
<P>
<PRE>   If the ODI MLID filename begins with a numeral, you must preface the
   filename with an "x" in the BINDINGS= statement. For example, 3COM's
   3C509 network adapter card uses an ODI MLID with a filename of
   "3C509.COM". In the PROTOCOL.INI file, the BINDINGS= statements would
   need to be:

      BINDINGS=X3C509.COM

</PRE>Although this is true for Windows for Workgroups 3.1, it is incorrect for
Windows for Workgroups 3.11.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 10-4: At Work PC Fax Does Not Route Incoming Faxes</h3>
 
<P>
Page 10-4 states the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Inbound faxes are received by the machine with the shared fax board and
   are then automatically routed to the correct recipient's PC.

</PRE>This is incorrect. At Work PC Fax does not route inbound faxes.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 13-5: Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Startup Switches</h3>
 
<P>
Page 13-5 incorrectly states:
<P>
<PRE>   ...starting Windows with the "Win /d:xsvfe" command would start Windows
   with all troubleshooting switches enabled.

</PRE>The command should be "Win /d:xsvfc."
<P>
