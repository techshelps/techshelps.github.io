</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running Novell NetWare when you start an MS-DOS-based
application or an MS-DOS command prompt from Microsoft Windows or
Windows for Workgroups, the screen may turn black and leave the cursor
flashing in the upper-left corner. If you have configured a program
information file (.PIF) so that your MS-DOS-based application starts
in a window, the screen is completely black; the flashing cursor does
not appear when the system stops responding (hangs).
<P>
<P><h3>Cause</h3>
 
<P>
The following factors can contribute to this problem (in order of
probability):

<UL><LI>Third-party device drivers or terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
   programs

<LI>An incorrect system configuration

<LI>A problem in VIPX.386

<LI>A problem in the Windows 3.1 virtual timing driver (VTD)
<P>
</UL>This problem is uncommon and is difficult to reproduce since it is
critical interrupt and/or timing dependent and generally occurs only
on large networks with high traffic volumes, which generate many
interrupts.
<P>
<P><h3>Resolution</h3>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot this problem, use the steps below. It is important to
follow these steps in order and leave each change in place, even
though one particular step alone may not correct the problem. Two or
more independent problems may combine to cause the symptoms described
above.

<OL><P><LI>Remove or comment out all unnecessary commands from your CONFIG.SYS
   and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to prevent conflicts with third-party device
   drivers or TSR programs. (To comment out a line, type REM at the
   beginning of the line. After you make these changes, restart your
   machine.) Starting your machine with a minimal configuration is
   called a "clean boot." A clean boot is a basic troubleshooting step
   to test possible conflicts between Windows and various TSR programs
   and device drivers.
<P>
<P><PRE>    NOTE: Once you implement all the steps in this procedure and
    correct the problem, you can begin to undo the changes you made to
    clean boot your system. If the problem recurs, you can isolate the
    device driver, TSR, or application that is causing the problem.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Ensure your Startup group is empty, and comment out the LOAD= and
   RUN= lines in the [windows] section of the WIN.INI file. (To
   comment out a line, place a semicolon [;] at the beginning of the
   line.) After you make these changes, restart Windows.

<P><LI>In the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, set the
   InDOSPolling= setting as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      InDOSPolling=FALSE
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove the TimerCriticalSection= setting from the [386Enh] section
   of the SYSTEM.INI file, then restart your system. If this doesn't
   correct the problem, reinsert the line as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      TimerCriticalSection=10000
</PRE>
<P><LI>Upgrade to version 3.32 or later of the Novell shell and Windows
   driver components available on Novell's CompuServe(R) NOVLIB forum
   as DOSUP7.ZIP. These components are also available through
   NetWire(R) and authorized Novell resellers.

<P><LI>Novell has updated and released a new VIPX.386 driver that is
   designed to correct a majority of the critical interrupt problems.
   Upgrade to version 1.15 or later of the Novell VIPX.386 driver,
   which is included with this Application Note. To install the new
   VIPX.386, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Rename or back up the old VIPX.386 file.
<P>
   b. Copy VIPX.386 from the enclosed WW0863 disk to your Windows
<P><PRE>      SYSTEM subdirectory. For example, if you inserted the WW0863
      disk in drive A and your Windows directory is called WINDOWS and
      is on drive C, type the following command at the MS-DOS command
      prompt and then press ENTER:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          copy a:\vipx.386 c:\windows\system

   c. If you are using IBM(R) LAN Support, put the network card's IRQ
      in the [VIPX] section of your SYSTEM.INI file.

   d. Reboot the machine, and then load the ODI drivers.

   You should also upgrade to version 2.11 or later of IPXODI.COM and
   version 2.02 or later of LSL.COM. These files are available on
   Novell's CompuServe NOVLIB forum in a self-extracting file called
   BSDUP2.EXE.

</PRE><P><LI>Reboot your system to see if the problem still occurs. If it does,
   go on to step 8.

<P><LI>The VTDA.386 file included with this application note is
   designed to fix a very small percentage of timer-related problems.
   To install VTDA.386, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Copy VTDA.386 from the enclosed WW0863 disk to your Windows
<P><PRE>      SYSTEM subdirectory. For example, if you inserted the WW0863
      disk in drive A and your Windows directory is called WINDOWS and
      is on drive C, type the following command at the MS-DOS command
      prompt and then press ENTER:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         copy a:\vtda.386 c:\windows\system

   b. In a text editor, such as Microsoft Windows Notepad, open the
      SYSTEM.INI file (located in your Windows directory).

   c. In the [386Enh] section, change

         device=*vtd

      to:

         device=vtda.386

   d. Save the file.

   e. Quit and then restart Windows.
