The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
Microsoft does not encourage nor support changes to .INF files; therefore,
Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) does not support the procedure in
this article. Although we have tested the following procedure and it
appears to function as described; we recommend that you make a backup copy
of your .INF file before you proceed.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Disable Modem Speaker option in Remote Access Services (RAS) works with
outgoing calls only. The Disable Modem Speaker option does not work when
the RAS server is in Answer mode.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some modems have a switch that allows you to control the speaker. If your
modem does not include this feature, it is possible to modify the MODEM.INF
file in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory to direct the modem to turn the
speaker off during incoming calls.
<P>
NOTE: The following procedure works only if your modem supports turning the
speaker off with a software command.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Disable the Modem Speaker</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Make a backup copy of your MODEM.INF file.

<P><LI>Make a note of the DeviceName= setting in the SERIAL.INI file in the
   Windows directory.

<P><LI>Load the MODEM.INF file in a text editor.
<P>
   NOTE: The MODEM.INF file is too large for the Microsoft Windows Notepad
   application that ships with Windows for Workgroups; you must use another
   text editor.

<P><LI>Search for the modem name that appeared on the DeviceName setting of the
   SERIAL.INI file.

<P><LI>Retrieve the AT command that appears on the &lt;speaker_off&gt;= line in this
   section.

<P><LI>Place the AT command from step 5 before the &lt;cr&gt; statement on the
   COMMAND_LISTEN= setting.
<P>
</OL><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
If the SERIAL.INI file contains the following line
<P>
<PRE>   DeviceName=Supra Fax Modem V32bis

</PRE></OL>and the MODEM.INF file has the following text
<P>
<PRE>   [Supra Fax Modem V32bis]
   &lt;speaker_on&gt;=M1
   &lt;speaker_off&gt;=M0
   ...
   COMMAND_LISTEN=ATS0=1&lt;cr&gt;
   ...

</PRE>change the Command_Listen setting to:
<P>
<PRE>   [Supra Fax Modem V32bis]
   &lt;speaker_on&gt;=M1
   &lt;speaker_off&gt;=M0
   ...
   COMMAND_LISTEN=ATS0=1 M0&lt;cr&gt;
   ...

</PRE>NOTE: This turns off the speaker when an incoming call is present; however,
the Disable Modem Speaker setting under Options is still a valid selection
for outgoing calls.
