The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows for Workgroups File Manager may be unable to
manipulate files or directories whose names contain extended characters.
Starting an application from File Manager by double-clicking a filename
that contains an extended character may fail, or File Manager may not
display the extended characters correctly and attempt to change to a
directory name containing an extended character.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows for Workgroups
versions 3.1 and 3.11. We are researching this problem and will place more
information here as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each character available to the operating system has a unique number.
MS-DOS reserves characters 0 through 31 for control characters. The
keyboard contains characters 32 through 127. The characters 128
through 255 are referred to as "extended characters."
<P>
Although MS-DOS may allow the use of these extended characters in
filenames and directory names, the Windows for Workgroups File Manager
may have difficulty manipulating files and directories named in this
manner.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem for Directory Name</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>At an MS-DOS command prompt, create a directory with an extended
   character embedded in its name. For example,
<P>
   a. Type:
<P>
<PRE>         md test

   b. Press ALT+255 (255 on the numeric keypad not on the keyboard).

   c. Type:

         dir

   d. Press ENTER.

</PRE><P><LI>From the Windows for Workgroups File Manager, attempt to
   double-click the newly created TEST DIR. Note that File Manager
   represents the directory as TEST_DIR, and that attempts to make it
   the current directory result in being returned to the root
   directory of the current drive.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem for a Filename</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>At an MS-DOS command prompt, copy an existing ASCII text file to a
   filename that contains an extended character. For example, to use
   the SETUP.TXT file in the WINDOWS directory, type the following at
   the WINDOWS directory MS-DOS command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy \windows\setup.txt \windows\test&lt;ALT+255&gt;fil.txt
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: &lt;ALT+255&gt; means press ALT+255 (255 on the numeric keypad and
   not on the keyboard).

<P><LI>From the Windows for Workgroup File Manager, double-click the newly
   created TEST FIL.TXT. Note that File Manager represents the file as
   TEST_FIL.TXT, and returns the follow message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      File Manager cannot find the specified file (or one of its
      components). Make sure the path and filename are correct and
      that all required libraries are available.
