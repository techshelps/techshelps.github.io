The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
From within Program Manager, you can use the /P parameter to run the
Windows Setup, forcing it to rebuild the default Program Manager groups and
icons. This feature behaves differently in Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1.
<P>
You can interfere with this maintenance mode operation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION WINDOWS 3.0</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>How Setup /P Works</h3>
 
<P>
For Windows 3.0, Setup /P will rebuild the default groups for Program
Manager, (Main, Accessories, Games) in a "destructive" manner. That
is, when it rebuilds the groups, it will do so from scratch; the new
groups will NOT include any icons that you added to the group. In
addition, the window's size and location will be overwritten.
<P>
<P><h3>Possible Problems</h3>
 
<P>
During the process of rebuilding the groups, the mouse cursor is live.
If you select a group during the process, an Unrecoverable Application
Error (UAE) may occur, or the system may stop, except for the mouse
cursor.
<P>
It is also possible that if you select one of the groups as they are
being rebuilt, the next icons added in the sequence will be put in the
wrong group. If a group is selected before it is rebuilt, the next
icons to be added will be put in the wrong group temporarily, until
the additional groups are rebuilt.
<P>
To correct these problems, run Setup /P again and do not use the
keyboard or mouse while the process is running.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION WINDOWS 3.1</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>How Setup /P Works</h3>
 
<P>
For Windows 3.1, Setup /P will rebuild the default Program Manager
Groups, (Main, Accessories, Games, Startup), in a non-destructive
manner. This process will KEEP any icons you have added to the default
groups, and it will not alter the size or window location of these
groups. Setup will restore the original icons for any of the default
items if they have been changed.
<P>
Because this is a "non-destructive" process, you will have to use the
following procedure to restore the default groups as they would be at
installation time:

<OL><P><LI>Exit Windows 3.1.

<P><LI>Delete the file PROGMAN.INI from the WINDOWS directory.

<P><LI>Start Windows again. Program Manager should load without any
   groups.

<P><LI>From the File Menu, choose Run.

<P><LI>Type the following text and press ENTER.
<P>
<P><PRE>     setup /p
</PRE><P>
</OL>This will rebuild the groups back to their default contents.
<P>
<P><h3>Possible Problems</h3>
 
<P>
The mouse cursor is active during this rebuilding process. If you
select either an open group, or a minimized group, the rebuilding
process will add the next icons in the rebuilding sequence to that
group. Whether you exit Windows Saving Settings or not, you will still
have these groups with non-default icons. Due to the "non-destructive"
process, use the method above for deleting PROGMAN.INI, and returning
to the original default groups.
<P>
If you select a minimized group (which opens the Control menu) during
the rebuilding process, after the rebuilding process the hourglass
pointer will not return to a standard pointer. Moving the mouse will
return it to the standard mouse pointer.
