<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, objects are passed
between applications through memory with OLE version 1.0; therefore, memory
availability is often the limiting factor for OLE operations. Using an
embedding function (such as OLE drag and dropping) with large objects can
cause duplication of data and require storage space.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Locality</h3>
 
<P>
To perform OLE functions, both the client and the server applications
must be on the same local machine. The information (that is, the
container document and the source files) can be stored on the file
server.
<P>
<P><h3>Embedding and Packaging</h3>
 
<P>
Embedding and creating packages by dragging and dropping an object from the
File Manager creates a copy of the object, which is stored in the container
document. Embedding large objects (such as sound) duplicates a large amount
of information and requires storage space. Embedding and OLE drag and
dropping large objects requires large amounts of memory.
<P>
<P><h3>Memory Limitations</h3>
 
<P>
All objects are passed through memory in OLE version 1.0. This places
limitations on OLE operations especially with low memory conditions.
<P>
<P><h3>Size of the Object</h3>
 
<P>
The size of objects being embedded or linked is limited by the system
resources (memory and storage) only.
<P>
<P><h3>Number of Linked or Embedded Objects per Document</h3>
 
<P>
The number of objects that you can embed or link is limited by the
system resources (memory and storage) only.
<P>
<P><h3>Activation Time for Objects</h3>
 
<P>
Different servers have different times of activation. For example, a
large spreadsheet application has a longer activation time than a
specialized mini-server. Also if the server is already running when
you activate an object, the activation time is significantly shorter.
