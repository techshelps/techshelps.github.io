</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
The WG0992 disk included with this Application Note contains updated files
for Microsoft At Work PC Fax version 1.0. The updated files correct the
following problems:

<UL><LI>Slow performance when you are using a shared fax device.
<P>
   Now when you use a shared fax device, you receive better
   performance because At Work PC Fax polls from the client only when
   pending fax jobs are on the server.

<LI>Extended characters are not rendered on cover pages.

<LI>The redial level cannot be set from the EFAXPUMP.INI file.
<P>
   You can now set the RedialLevel=&lt;n&gt; entry in the [EfaxPump] section
   of the EFAXPUMP.INI file. If RedialLevel is not set, or is set to 0
   (zero), Microsoft At Work PC Fax redials only when the line is
   busy. If RedialLevel is  set to 1, Microsoft At Work PC Fax redials
   when any dial failure occurs (for example, the line is busy, the
   other party does not answer, or there is no dial tone).

<LI>Microsoft At Work PC Fax stops responding (hangs) when the
   EFAXPUMP.INI file becomes too large.
<P>
   Previously, Microsoft At Work PC Fax would hang when the
   EFAXPUMP.INI file reached approximately 55 kilobytes in size.
   Microsoft At Work PC Fax now displays a warning message when the
   EFAXPUMP.INI file becomes too large.

<LI>Timing problems occur when you send a fax in facsimile format from
   an application that does not support running multiple instances
   during printing.
<P>
   Microsoft At Work PC Fax now recognizes the [PCFaxCompatibility]
   section in the WIN.INI file. This allows Microsoft At Work PC Fax
   to keep track of applications that do not support running multiple
   instances during printing. The format of the [PCFaxCompatibility]
   section is as follows
<P>
<P><PRE>      [PCFaxCompatibility]
      &lt;AppExeName&gt;=0x0001
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;AppExeName&gt; is the application's filename (without its
   extension).

<LI>Shared CAS modems fail when capability is set to RES_SUPER_SUPER.
<P>
   Previously, a shared CAS modem would return the unsupported
   capabilities resolution RES_SUPER_SUPER to the client. Shared CAS
   fax modems no longer return capabilities to the fax client since
   these are needed only by the shared fax server.
<P>
</UL><h3>To install the updated Microsoft At Work PC Fax files</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>Insert the enclosed WG0992 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive.

<P><LI>To copy the files to the Windows directory, type the following at
   the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\*.dll &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the WG0992 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is your Windows drive and directory.
<P>
   For example, if the WG0992 disk is in drive A and your Windows
   directory is called WINDOWS and is on drive C, type the following
   at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\*.dll c:\windows
</PRE><P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
