The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using Bitstream FaceLift, you may receive one of the following
two error messages when you attempt to print from a Windows-based
application:
<P>
<PRE>   Data in section "Shell devices" in WIN.INI is corrupted
   or SHELL PRT is directly assigned

   -or-

   Shellprt directly assigned in shell devices

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These messages indicate that Bitstream FaceLift is installed and not
functioning correctly. Contact Bitstream technical support for help in
correcting this error message.
<P>
Bitstream FaceLift replaces the drivers listed for the printer devices
under the [devices], [PrinterPorts], and [Shelldevices] sections of
the WIN.INI file with its own printer driver. The error message above
specifically relates to an invalid entry in the [Shelldevices]
section.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
The error messages can be caused by any of the following conditions:

<UL><LI>There is an invalid entry in FaceLift's [Shelldevices] section.
<P>
   Solution
   --------
<P>
   1. Run the FaceLift icon and select Parameters.
<P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: If you can't find the icon, from Program Manager, open the File
      menu and choose Run. On the Command Line type "facelift" (without
      the quotation marks) and choose OK. (FACELIFT.EXE is installed in the
      Windows directory so you don't need to specify a drive or
      directory.)
</PRE><P>
   2. Clear the FaceLift active box.
<P>
   3. Choose OK.
<P>
   4. Select Printers and unassign the FaceLift shell-driver.
<P>
   5. Exit and restart Windows.
<P>
   6. Reinstall FaceLift.

<LI>A default printer has not been selected in the Windows Control
   Panel.
<P>
   Solution
   --------
<P>
   1. Run Control Panel and choose the Printers icon.
<P>
   2. Check and make sure that there is a default printer selected.

<LI>A Windows version 3.0 printer driver is assigned to the same printer
   port as a Windows version 3.1 driver.
<P>
   Solution
   --------
<P>
   1. Run Control Panel and choose the Printers icon.
<P>
   2. Remove or change the port that the Windows 3.0 driver uses.

<LI>The Atech PowerPak printer driver is on the same port as a
   Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet driver.
<P>
   Solution
   --------
<P>
   1. Run Control Panel and choose the Printers icon.
<P>
   2. Remove or change the port that is being used by one of these
<P><PRE>      font applications.
</PRE><P>
