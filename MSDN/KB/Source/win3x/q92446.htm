</PRE><h3>About This Update</h3>
 
<P>
The enclosed WW0634 disk contains an updated version of the
LANMAN21.DRV file for use with Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.1 and
Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1.
<P>
<PRE>  NOTE: By using the following Windows 3.1 driver (the "Software"),
  you are hereby agreeing to the included license agreement. Please
  review the LICENSE.TXT file on the enclosed disk.

</PRE>The updated driver corrects a problem that produces the following
error message when you install WinLogin:

<PRE>   WinLogin Client Setup Error

   machine's configuration files are to be stored.
   Please ensure this machine has access to the remote network
   resource and retry.

</PRE><h3>Added Features</h3>
 
<P>
The updated driver also supplies Windows 3.1 with the following
features:

<UL><LI>Shows only one dialog box for both net connections and net
   disconnections. Previously, there were two separate dialog boxes.

<LI>Allows you to make multiple disconnections without having to
   leave the dialog box. Previously, the dialog box closed after each
   disconnection.

<LI>Allows you to view your previous connections in a drop-down
   list box from the Net Connections dialog box.

<LI>Includes a Reconnect At Startup check box that allows you to
   designate a connection as a "persistent connection" (that is,
   Windows 3.1 will make the connection to this share each time you
</UL>log
<PRE>   on).
