The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are many problems that may be related to the VGA card. If you
don't know the brand of your VGA card or if there is no information
available for the card, you can use the following procedures to
troubleshoot possible video problems.
<P>
The following symptoms may indicate a problem with your VGA card:

<UL><LI>Windows Setup may hang while Disk 2 attempts to change to a
   graphics screen.

<LI>Windows may not start in one or more modes.

<LI>The screen may be garbled or show incorrect colors in Windows or in
   MS-DOS applications.

<LI>MS-DOS applications may not run properly. This includes the machine
   locking and "System Integrity Violation" errors.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Before Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<P>
Make sure that Windows version 3.0 or 3.0a was installed using one of
the VGA drivers provided in the Windows package. If not, run Setup,
and change to the standard VGA driver.
<P>
NOTE: If the problem occurs only when using a driver supplied by the
manufacturer of the VGA card, contact that manufacturer.
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting Procedures</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Some cards may work better with the VGA driver for "QuadVGA, ATI
   VIP VGA, and 82C441 VGAs." Try changing to this driver if the
   standard VGA driver isn't working. If the problem continues,
   reinstall the standard VGA driver and continue troubleshooting.

<P><LI>If the VGA card manufacturer has provided a driver that is Windows
   version 3.0 compatible, try changing to this driver. If the
   problem continues, reinstall the standard VGA driver and continue
   troubleshooting.

<P><LI>Windows running in 386 enhanced mode may not properly detect the
   presence of the VGA card in memory, and it may try to use the same
   addresses that the cards are using. Most VGA cards make use of the
   address ranges A000-C7FF. A few cards may extend up to CA7F. For
   testing purposes, try using EMMExclude=A000-CBFF in the [386Enh]
   section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

<P><LI>Determine if the VGA card auto switches. If it does, disable this
   feature.

<P><LI>Check the system for situations that could have led to a corrupted
   installation of Windows (that is, MS-DOS version 4.01 commands, TSR
   [terminate-and-stay-resident] programs, and so on).

<P><LI>Some VGA cards may require an updated BIOS to run properly with
   Windows. If the above procedures fail to correct the video
   problems, refer to the card's manufacturer.
<P>
</OL>If the VGA video driver does not work, try the VGA 3.0 driver included
with Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1. If this works
correctly, contact the video card manufacturer. The Windows 3.0 video
driver does not have all the functionality of the standard VGA driver,
and should not be considered a final solution.
