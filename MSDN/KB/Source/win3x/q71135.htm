The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you run Microsoft Windows version 3.0 in enhanced mode on a Novell
network with a DCA Irmatrak Token ring board, you may not be able to see
files on a network drive within File Manager, and the print servers may not
show up when you select the network printers in Control Panel.
<P>
This information applies to Microsoft Windows version 3.0, and 3.0a. This
information does not apply to later versions of  Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is a known problem with the DCA Network drivers supplied with the
card.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
There are two methods you can use to work around these problems:

<UL><LI>Run Windows in standard or real mode.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Disable the DMA for the Network card.
<P>
   To disable the DMA, you need to run the JUMPERS utility. JUMPERS is
   a Novell shareware utility that allows you to change the IPX.COM
   without rerunning SHELLGEN. (SHELLGEN is a Novell utility for
   generating IPX.COM. It allows you to specify the type of network
   card and its configuration.) JUMPERS is located on the Installation
   and Configuration disk that comes with the DCA board. To run the
   JUMPERS utility, type "jumpers ipx.com" (without the quotation
   marks) from the MS-DOS prompt and then select none for DMA.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve the problem on a more permanent basis, you need to update
your driver files. Check if the following Novell files are earlier than
version 3.02 or have dates earlier than the following:
<P>
<PRE>   IPX.OBJ             12/18/90
   NETx.COM            02/06/91
   VNETWARE.386        03/11/91
   NETWARE.DRV         04/01/91

</PRE>These files can be downloaded via NETWIRE on COMPUSERV. To get them,
type "GO NOVLIB" and then download the WINUP2.ZIP file.
<P>
Version 1.10 is the minimum required to correct the problem. If you have
version 1.10 or later, you do not need the updated Novell files above.
You can obtain a current version of the DCA network drivers from the
DCA Update Department.
