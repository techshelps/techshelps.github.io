The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Workgroup Connections version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Workgroup Connections workstation services may run either the basic or
full redirector.
<P>
Type the following to load basic workstation services (basic services
are the default):
<P>
<PRE>   net start workstation

   -or-

   net start basic

</PRE>Type the following to load the full redirector services:
<P>
<PRE>   net start full

</PRE>You can change the default workstation service to full by adding the
entry AutoStart=Full in the [Network] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The full redirector differs from the basic redirector in that it
allows named-pipe support and full LAN Manager API support.
<P>
The AutoStart= entry specifies which network terminate-and-stay-
resident (TSR) programs are loaded when the NET START command is
issued with no arguments. By default, this performs only a NETBIND to
complete loading of protocols and adapter drivers. If a later NET
command requires loading of a redirector, the full redirector is
loaded by default.
<P>
If, however, you change the entry to AutoStart=Basic as the Workgroup
Connections installation program does, the NET START command placed in
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file starts the basic redirector. When the
redirector loads, the NetBEUI TSR also loads (if you don't already
have a NetBIOS protocol present).
<P>
Other NET START options include:
<P>
<PRE>   NET START [{POPUP | BASIC | FULL | WORKSTATION | NETBIND |
   NETBEUI}] [/LIST] [/YES]

   POPUP           Loads the pop-up interface into memory.
                   Use this option if the pop-up interface
                   is not automatically loaded each time you
                   start your computer.
   BASIC           Starts the basic redirector.
   FULL            Starts the full redirector.
   WORKSTATION     Starts the default redirector.
   NETBIND         Binds protocols and network card drivers.
   NETBEUI         Starts the NetBIOS interface.
   /LIST           Displays a list of the Workgroup Connection
                   components that have been started.
   /YES            Carries out the NET START command without
                   first prompting you to provide information or
                   confirm actions.

</PRE>This entry takes a comma-separated list; for example
<P>
<PRE>   AutoStart=NETBEUI,BASIC,POPUP

</PRE>causes the indicated three services to start when NET START is issued
from AUTOEXEC.BAT.
