The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If Windows for Workgroups 3.11 has been configured to provide Novell
NetWare connectivity and you try to connect to a Windows for Workgroups
3.1, 3.11, or Windows NT 3.1 server with the real-mode redirector, the
following error may occur:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 53:  The computer name specified in the network path
              cannot be located.

</PRE>This error may occur when you run a NET USE or NET VIEW command with the
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 real-mode redirector. This error may also occur
when you are using the real-mode redirector even though no error occurs
when you are connected to the same servers from within Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 while using the protected-mode redirector.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When Windows for Workgroups 3.11 is configured to provide Novell NetWare
connectivity, the real-mode redirector uses the IPX transport provided by
the Novell NetWare IPXODI driver.
<P>
A relationship called direct hosting is formed between the real-mode
redirector and the IPX transport. Direct hosting allows data to be
transferred between these two layers without requiring the presence of a
NetBIOS interface.
<P>
Under this configuration, you cannot use the real-mode redirector to access
a server unless the server is running an IPX/SPX compatible transport.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
With this configuration, a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 server must be
configured to use the IPX/SPX Compatible Transport or IPX/SPX Compatible
Transport with NetBIOS to be accessible by the real-mode redirector.
<P>
There is no resolution available for a Windows NT server because the NWLink
IPX/SPX Compatible Transport provided with Windows NT requires a NetBIOS
interface that is not provided by the real-mode redirector in Windows for
Workgroups when a direct-hosting relationship exists.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 in a Novell
NetWare environment, you can install support for Novell NetWare
connectivity in addition to the Microsoft Windows Network.
<P>
To install support for Novell NetWare connectivity, select Novell NetWare
(Workstation Shell) as an additional network in the Networks dialog box of
Network Setup. This support also requires selecting one of the following
drivers from the Network Driver dialog box of Network Setup:
<P>
<PRE>   IPXODI Support Driver (ArcNet)
   IPXODI Support Driver (Ethernet)
   IPXODI Support Driver (Token Ring)

</PRE>This configuration allows Windows for Workgroups 3.11 to enable Novell
NetWare connectivity by interfacing with the IPX transport contained in the
Novell NetWare ODI drivers.
<P>
When you use this configuration with the Windows for Workgroups real-mode
redirector to connect to Windows for Workgroups servers, one of the
following protocol drivers should be selected in the Network Drivers dialog
box of Network Setup on the Windows for Workgroups server machine.
<P>
<PRE>   IPX/SPX Compatible Transport

   -or-

   IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with NetBIOS

</PRE>Installing one of these IPX/SPX compatible transports enables the real-mode
redirector to connect to the Windows for Workgroups server.
