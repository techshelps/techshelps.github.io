The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11 README.WRI file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
10.2  Upgrading Display Drivers When Using Soft-Font Packages
<P>
If you are using certain soft-font packages, including Bitstream
Facelift, Publisher PowerPak, and Hewlett-Packard Intellifont, Setup
may not update your display driver when you upgrade to Windows for
Workgroups. In this case, you need to update your display driver
after you have set up Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
To update your display driver after you have set up Windows for Workgroups:

<OL><P><LI>From the Main group, run Windows Setup.

<P><LI>Choose Change System Settings from the Options menu.

<P><LI>From the list of Display options, select the display drivers you
   want to use.
<P>
</OL>For more information about using Setup after you have installed
Windows, see "Configuring Hardware" in your Windows or Windows for
Workgroups user's guide.
<P>
10.3  Using Self-Configuring Display Adapters
<P>
Some display adapters can change their configurations to match what
an application tries to do. For example, if an application tries to
use a video graphics adapter (VGA) configuration and your display
adapter is currently configured as an enhanced graphics adapter
(EGA), the adapter can switch from an EGA configuration to a VGA
configuration. This type of display adapter makes use of nonmaskable
interrupts (NMIs) to change its configuration while you work.
<P>
To use this type of display adapter, you must disable the NMI (also
called self-configuring, auto-switching, or auto-emulating) option
after you configure the display adapter. For more information, see
your display-adapter documentation.
<P>
10.4  LCD
<P>
If you use an LCD screen, set it for white text on a black background
instead of black text on a white background. When Windows is running,
black text on a white background wears out LCD screens. See the
documentation for your screen for instructions on how to do this.
<P>
10.5  Super VGA
<P>
If you are using a video card and monitor (NEC MultiSync 3D/4D/5D or
other multifrequency monitor) capable of 800x600, 16-color resolution
with a third-party Super VGA driver, use the Super VGA (800x600, 16
colors) driver provided with Windows for Workgroups instead. If you
do not update your driver, Windows may not work properly.
<P>
To install the Windows for Workgroups Super VGA driver, run Windows
Setup from the Main group, and then select "Super VGA 800x600, 16
colors" from the list of Display options. For more information about
using Setup after you have installed Windows for Workgroups, see your
user's guide.
<P>
Super VGA VESA Mode 6Ah
<P>
Some Super VGA adapters support higher monitor-refresh rates at
800x600 resolution with a special VESA mode. If both your video
adapter and monitor support a higher refresh rate and if you are
using the Super VGA driver, you may be able to get better video
results by including the following setting in the [display] section
of the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
svgamode=106
<P>
If you encounter problems using this mode, delete this setting from
the SYSTEM.INI file, and then restart Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
10.6  Third-Party Display Drivers: Running MS-DOS Based Applications
<P>
If you are using a display driver that is not provided with Windows
for Workgroups and you receive one of the following messages while
trying to run a MS-DOS based application:
<P>
"Incorrect system version. Run the Windows Setup program again."
<PRE>     or
</PRE></OL>"386 System display type mismatch."
<P>
Run Setup again, and if that doesn't work, contact your display
manufacturer for an updated driver.
<P>
10.7  VGA-Compatible
<P>
Most VGA-compatible display-adapter cards and main-adapter chips use
additional memory to enhance their performance. When Windows is
configured for VGA, Windows detects most of these cards and
automatically excludes the additional memory.
<P>
However, if you have an enhanced VGA that Windows does not recognize,
you must exclude the additional memory yourself by adding the
following line to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
emmexclude=C400-C7FF
<P>
For more information about modifying the SYSTEM.INI file, see the
SYSINI.WRI online document.
<P>
10.8  Video Seven: Using 256-Color Support
<P>
Windows for Workgroups provides 256-color support at several
resolutions for Video Seven display adapters that have at least 512K
of video memory. The following table shows the Video Seven 256-color
modes that are supported by the display drivers provided with Windows
for Workgroups.
<P>
<PRE>Model          640x480     720x512     800x600     1024x768
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
<P>
<PRE>FastWrite 512K   Yes
1024i 512K       Yes
VRAM 512K        Yes         Yes
VRAM II 512K     Yes         Yes
VRAM II 1MB      Yes         Yes         Yes         Yes

</PRE>If you are using a Video Seven display adapter that has at least 512K of
video memory, you should use one of these display drivers. These drivers
take full advantage of the performance improvements and mouse support in MS-
DOS based applications. To install one of the drivers, run Windows Setup
from the Main group, and then select the driver you want from the list of
Display options. For more information about using Setup after you have
installed Windows, see "Configuring Hardware" in your Windows or Windows
for Workgroups user's guide.
<P>
Note:  Windows for Workgroups does not include drivers for the new Video
Seven display adapters that are based on Headland Technology/Video 7 HT216,
HT216-32, or HT217. If you have one of these display adapters, Setup
automatically installs a VGA driver. Your display-adapter package may
include an updated driver, which you can install by using the instructions
included in the package. If no updated driver is included, you can obtain
one by contacting your display-adapter vendor.
<P>
10.9  WinSpeed
<P>
The WinSpeed version 1.0 installation program, INSTALL.EXE, does not
work properly with Windows for Workgroups. It copies an incompatible
version of the SETUP.INF file to your Windows directory. To install
WinSpeed for use with Windows for Workgroups, you must get updated
installation disks from Panacea.
<P>
If you have already used the INSTALL.EXE program to install the
WinSpeed drivers on your system, the following message appears when
you try to run Windows Setup from the Main group:
<P>
"The SETUP.INF file on your system is not valid for use with this
version of Setup."
<P>
To correct this problem:

<OL><P><LI>If there is a SETUP.INF file in your Windows directory, delete
   it. (The SETUP.INF file should never be in your Windows directory.)

<P><LI>Copy the SETUP.INF file on Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
   Disk 1 to your Windows SYSTEM directory.

<P><LI>Contact Panacea, Inc. for updated WinSpeed installation disks
   that are compatible with Windows for Workgroups, and then use these
   to reinstall WinSpeed.
<P>
</OL>10.10  IBM XGA: Configuring Color and Resolution
<P>
Windows Setup automatically configures an IBM XGA for 16-color,
640x480 resolution. If your monitor can support 256 colors or higher
resolutions, you can configure your XGA to use the color and
resolution settings you want. To do this, run Windows Setup from the
Main group, and then select one of the following drivers from the
list of Display options:

<UL><LI>XGA (640x480, 16 colors)
   This is the default setting and should not be changed if you are
   using the plasma screen on the PS/2 model 75.
<LI>XGA (640x480, 256 colors)
<LI>XGA (Small fonts)
<LI>XGA (Large fonts)
<P>
</UL>Both the Small and Large fonts settings configure the XGA for
1024x786 resolution and 256 colors, if your monitor supports it.
Otherwise, these settings configure your display for 640x480
resolution. Select Small Fonts if you have a large monitor (at least
16 inches) or want to fit more information on your screen. Select
Large Fonts if you want to improve the readability of text.
<P>
Make sure that your monitor supports the XGA configuration you
select. If it does not, you will return to the MS-DOS prompt when you
try to start Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
For more information about using Setup after you have installed
Windows, see "Configuring Hardware" in your Windows or Windows for
Workgroups user's guide.
<P>
10.11  IBM XGA: Using EMM386
<P>
To use the IBM XGA display adapter successfully with the EMM386
expanded-memory emulator, you need to manually prevent EMM386 from
using the memory address range used by the XGA display. A common
range is C600-C7FF. To prevent the memory manager from using this
range, include the X= option on the device=EMM386.EXE line in your
CONFIG.SYS file, as follows:
<P>
device=EMM386.EXE  X=C600-C7FF
<P>
To identify the exact range that your XGA display adapter uses, run
the System Configuration Program on the System Reference Disk for
your Personal System/2 (PS/2), and select "Display Memory Map."
<P>
With some PS/2 model 75 plasma screens, or with XGA display adapters
configured for 640x480 resolution and 16 colors, you must also
include the NOEMS or RAM option on the device=EMM386.EXE line in your
CONFIG.SYS file. For example:
<P>
device=EMM386.EXE  NOEMS  X=C600-C7FF
<P>
Do not include the i=B000-BE00 option on the device=EMM386.EXE line
in your CONFIG.SYS file. This address range is used by the XGA when
running Windows. Therefore, it cannot be used as upper memory area.
Windows will not recognize XGA configurations if EMM386 is using this
address range.
<P>
For more information about modifying your CONFIG.SYS file, see your
MS-DOS documentation. For more information about installing the
EMM386 expanded-memory emulator and configuring the way it uses
memory, see "Managing Memory and Performance" in your Windows or
Windows for Workgroups user's guide.
<P>
<P>
11.0  Using Specific Mice with Windows for Workgroups
<P>
This section describes some problems you may encounter using specific
types of mice with Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
11.1  Microsoft Mouse
<P>
Windows for Workgroups includes version 8.20 of the Microsoft mouse
drivers. If you have a Microsoft mouse, Setup installs the Windows
mouse driver (MOUSE.DRV) in your Windows SYSTEM directory and an
MS-DOS mouse driver (MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS) in your Windows
directory. If you have additional versions of the Microsoft mouse
drivers on your system, make sure that you are using the mouse
drivers provided with Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
If you use the Microsoft Mouse Control Panel version 8.0 or later,
you need to set your MS-DOS mouse variable to the directory on your
hard disk that contains the control-panel program files POINT.EXE and
PANEL.COM.
<P>
You can do this by modifying your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For example, if
the control-panel program files are located in the \MOUSE directory,
you would add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
set mouse=c:\mouse
<P>
This ensures that the mouse settings are stored in the MOUSE.INI file
located in the specified directory. If the mouse variable is not set
correctly, you may experience problems with mouse acceleration and
other mouse settings.
<P>
It is recommended that you use the mouse driver MOUSE.COM instead of
MOUSE.SYS, and that you load MOUSE.COM from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
If you use MOUSE.SYS, you may encounter problems saving MS-DOS mouse
control-panel settings. If you must use MOUSE.SYS and you encounter
problems saving mouse settings, make sure you load the driver from
your mouse directory instead of from your Windows directory.
<P>
For more information about installing the mouse drivers, see your
Windows or Windows for Workgroups user's guide.
<P>
11.2  Genius Mouse
<P>
If you are using a Genius mouse and are running MS-DOS based
applications, the mouse may not work properly, especially if you have
several MS-DOS based applications running at the same time.
<P>
To correct this problem, add the following line to the [386Enh]
section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
local=PC$MOUSE
<P>
For more information about changing settings in the SYSTEM.INI file,
see the SYSINI.WRI online document.
<P>
11.3  Logitech Mouse

<UL><LI>Some Logitech mouse models are detected as "Microsoft or IBM PS/2"
   mouse models by the Setup program. In this case, Setup installs the
   mouse driver for the Microsoft or IBM PS/2 mouse. If you have a
   Logitech mouse, you should use the Logitech mouse driver instead.
<P>
   To install the Logitech mouse driver, run Windows Setup from the Main
   group, and then select Logitech from the list of Mouse options. For
   more information about using Setup after you have installed Windows,
   see "Configuring Hardware" in your Windows or Windows for Workgroups
   user's guide.

<LI>When installing the Logitech mouse driver, Windows Setup copies
   the LMOUSE.COM file to your Windows directory. This is the mouse
   driver that is required in order to use the Logitech mouse with
   MS-DOS based applications. To use your mouse with MS-DOS based
   applications, you need to load LMOUSE.COM before you start Windows.
   You can do this by adding it to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. You also need
   to add the following line to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI
   file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      local=PC$MOUSE
</PRE><P>
</UL>11.4  Logitech Cordless Mouse
<P>
If you have a Logitech Cordless mouse, you may encounter problems,
such as an unresponsive pointer, when you are running the MS-DOS
Prompt or MS-DOS based applications in a window.
<P>
To correct this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Change the baud-rate setting for the mouse driver. To do this,
   add the following line to the [LogiMouse] section of the SYSTEM.INI
   file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      BaudRate=1200
</PRE>
<P><LI>Include the 1200 option in the command line that loads the MS-DOS
   Logitech mouse driver (which is provided with Windows for Workgroups)
   as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      LMOUSE 1200
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the above line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to load the mouse
   driver each time you start your system. The next time you start
   Windows for Workgroups, your mouse should work correctly.
<P>
   For more information about changing settings in the SYSTEM.INI file,
   see the SYSINI.WRI online document.
<P>
</OL>11.5  Logitech or Microsoft BallPoint Mouse on a Toshiba T2200SX
<P>
If you are using a Toshiba T2200SX computer with a BIOS version
earlier than 1.20 and you have a Logitech or Microsoft ballpoint
mouse connected to the PS/2 mouse port, you may have problems moving
the mouse pointer. If the mouse does not respond, try connecting your
mouse to the serial port instead, or contact Toshiba for an upgraded
version of the BIOS.
<P>
11.6  Mouse Systems Mouse on PS/2 Ports
<P>
The "Mouse Systems" serial and bus mouse drivers provided with
Windows do not support a Mouse Systems mouse when it is connected to
a PS/2-style mouse port. If you are using a Mouse Systems mouse
connected to a PS/2-style mouse port, Setup installs the "Microsoft
or IBM PS/2" mouse driver for you. This is the correct driver. Do not
change it.
<P>
<P>
12.0  Using Additional Hardware Configurations with Windows for Workgroups
<P>
This section contains information about using Windows for Workgroups
with different types of computers and hardware configurations.
<P>
12.1  CD-ROM Drives

<UL><LI>If you are using a CD-ROM drive, you should use version 2.23 of
   Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX), the version shipped with
   Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, with all configurations of
   CD-ROM drives.
<P>
   If you have upgraded from Windows version 3.1 or Windows for
   Workgroups version 3.1, you must remove the following setting from
   the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      device=LANMAN10.386
</PRE><P>
   This setting can cause some CD-ROM drives to timeout and fail with
   versions later than 2.20 of MSCDEX. However, if you must use a
   version earlier than 2.20 of MSCDEX, the above setting is required in
   the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
   For more information about changing settings in the SYSTEM.INI file,
   see the SYSINI.WRI online document.

<LI>If a CD-ROM drive causes instability in your system or causes your
   system to fail, you may need to update the CD-ROM driver. Also, the
   MCI (Media Control Interface) driver MCICDA.DRV may not work properly
   with older CD-ROM drivers. Contact your CD-ROM-drive manufacturer
   about obtaining an updated driver.
