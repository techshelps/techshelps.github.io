The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The CalComp Wiz Mouse requires a special driver to work properly with
Windows. If you use the CalComp Wiz Mouse with any of the mouse
drivers that ship with Windows, you may experience slow hard disk
access time (for example, 3 to 5 minutes to load Microsoft Excel) or
programs may return to an MS-DOS Prompt unexpectedly.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
CalComp technical support has confirmed that the CalComp Wiz Mouse
does not work properly with any mouse drivers supplied with Windows.
They have developed and tested a mouse driver for use with Windows 3.0
and 3.0a. This driver will also allow you to use the Wiz Mouse with
Windows 3.1, but is not 100-percent compatible. CalComp is currently
developing a new driver for use with Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
According to CalComp, the following temporary workaround allows the Wiz
Mouse to be used with Windows 3.0 until you can obtain the CalComp driver:

<OL><P><LI>From Windows Setup, install the Mouse Systems serial mouse on either
   your COM1 or COM2 driver.

<P><LI>Using a text editor, insert the following two lines in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      mode comx: 9600,n,8,1  (where comx = com1, com2, com3..)
</PRE><P>
<PRE>      echo 2 m&gt;comx:         (where comx = com1, com2, com3..)

</PRE><P><LI>Restart the computer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Obtaining the CalComp Driver</h3>
 
<P>
To obtain the Wiz Mouse driver for Windows 3.0 and 3.0a, call CalComp
technical support or call the CalComp BBS. The driver for Windows is WIZ11D-
W.ZIP and the driver for MS-DOS is WIZ11D-D.ZIP.
<P>
Once downloaded, these files must be unzipped and the files WIZ-DRV1.DRV
and WIZ-DRV2.DRV should be copied to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
To install the Wiz Mouse Windows drivers, use a text editor such as
Notepad to change the following lines in the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   [Boot]
   mouse.drv=wiz-drv1.drv  (for mouse on Com1)

      -or-

   mouse.drv=wiz-drv2.drv  (for mouse on Com2)

   [Boot.description]
   mouse.drv=WIZ driver 1.01 for Windows(R) 3.00 Feb. 4. 1991

</PRE></OL>The CalComp Wiz Mouse is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft;
