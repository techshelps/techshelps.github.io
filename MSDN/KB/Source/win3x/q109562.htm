</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
When you start a Windows-based application under Windows for
Workgroups 3.11, you may experience a five-second delay before any
disk activity occurs and the application begins to load. This delay
occurs if you have 32-bit file access enabled and you are using one of
the following network configurations:
<P>
<PRE>   MSIPX
   Novell(R) NE2000.COM ODI driver and IPXODI

  NOTE: Microsoft has confirmed this problem occurs with version 1.34
  of the NE2000 multiple link interface device (MLID) driver (dated
  6/3/91) and the versions included in the Novell DOSUP7 and DOSUP8
  client files (dated 1/18/93 and 7/30/93, respectively).

</PRE>This delay is caused by the 32-bit file access real-mode mapper
(RMM.D32) timing out. Once the application loads, it runs at normal
speed because it is now stored in the 32-bit disk cache (VCACHE.386).
<P>
You can work around this delay by disabling 32-bit file access or by
installing the updated RMM.D32 file contained on the WG0973 disk
included with this Application Note. The updated RMM.D32 file is not
hard-coded for a five-second time-out. Instead, it has a one-second
default time-out and can be configured using the RMMTimeout= entry in
the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
<P><h3>To install the updated RMM.D32 file</h3>
 
<P>
Insert the enclosed WG0973 disk in the appropriate floppy disk drive.
Copy RMM.D32 to your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory using the following
command
<P>
<PRE>   copy &lt;drive&gt;:\rmm.d32 &lt;destination&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the WG0973 disk and
&lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory of your Windows SYSTEM
subdirectory. For example, if your WG0973 disk is in drive A, and your
Windows directory is C:\WINDOWS, type the following at the MS-DOS
command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<PRE>   copy a:\rmm.d32 c:\windows\system

</PRE><h3>Configuring the RMM.D32 Time-Out Setting</h3>
 
<P>
To change the one-second default time-out value for the updated
RMM.D32 file, open your SYSTEM.INI file in Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups Notepad, locate the [386Enh] section, and add the
RMMTimeout= entry setting (which is expressed in milliseconds). For
example, to increase the time-out for RMM.D32 to two seconds, add the
following entry to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   RMMTimeout=2000

</PRE>To decrease the time-out for RMM.D32 to half a second, change the
setting as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   RMMTimeout=500
