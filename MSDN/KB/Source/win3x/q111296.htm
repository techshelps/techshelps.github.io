The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, 3.11
<P>
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start some of the utilities that come with the Windows for
Workgroups Resource Kit version 3.11, the following error message is
displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   The file THREED.VBX is out of date. This program requires a newer
   version.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message is displayed because an older version of THREED.VBX is
on the hard disk drive and still in memory. Some of the utilities in the
Resource Kit use the file THREED.VBX to display 3-dimensional controls.
Other third party applications also use THREED.VBX, so this may occur even
though the Resource Kit is not installed on the machine.
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, search the hard disk drive for any THREED.VBX
files that are not 64,544 in size and delete them. The correct THREED.VBX,
which is installed by the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit, should be
located in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. The file date should be the
date that the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Resource Kit utilities were
installed on the machine.
<P>
After you delete any THREED.VBX files that are not 64,544 in size, exit and
reenter Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
If there is not a THREED.VBX file with the size 64,544, you should expand
this file from the Resource Kit disk by using the EXPAND.EXE utility. To
expand THREED.VB_ from the Resource Kit disk, type the following from the
Windows directory at an MS-DOS command prompt
<P>
<PRE>   expand &lt;a&gt;:\mail\threed.vb_ &lt;c&gt;:\windows\system\threed.vbx

</PRE>where &lt;a&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the Resource Kit disk, &lt;c&gt; is
your hard disk drive, and &lt;windows\system&gt; is your Windows SYSTEM
subdirectory.
