The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Compaq Corporation is now including the EXMEM.EXE memory manager with its
COMPAQ desktop computers. According to Compaq, this memory manager should
be removed prior to the installation of Windows, Windows for Workgroups, or
MS-DOS Upgrade.
<P>
During installation of Windows or MS-DOS, EXMEM.EXE may be detected as an
incompatible terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program, and other problems
may cause Setup to fail.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>EXMEM.EXE with Windows 3.1 and 3.11</h3>
 
<P>
The EXMEM.EXE memory manager is a combined extended and expanded memory
manager for COMPAQ desktop computers. According to Compaq Technical
Support, EXMEM.EXE was designed to eliminate the need for two memory
managers in the CONFIG.SYS file (HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE).
<P>
Windows 3.1 does not recognize EXMEM.EXE as an expanded memory provider. If
you need expanded memory support, use EMM386.EXE and HIMEM.SYS, which are
provided on the Windows disks, instead of EXMEM.EXE.
<P>
To use EXMEM.EXE with Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode, your CONFIG.SYS
file should include the following line:
<P>
<PRE>   Device=C:\DOS\EXMEM.EXE NoEMS

</PRE>If you plan to use EXMEM.EXE after you install Windows or Windows for
Workgroups, you must obtain an updated driver called CPQVDD.386. This
driver is available as either as SP0298.EXE or SP0298.ZIP from the Compaq
bulletin board service (BBS).
<P>
<P><h3>EXMEM.EXE with MS-DOS 6.x</h3>
 
<P>
EMM386.EXE is included with MS-DOS 6.x as well. The MS-DOS 6.x MemMaker
utility does not recognize EXMEM.EXE and its loadhigh component, RUNHI.EXE.
<P>
Compaq includes the RUNHI command with its version of MS-DOS 5.0. This
command replaces both DEVICEHIGH and LOADHIGH, and provides more control
over where programs are loaded. RUNHI is compatible with MS-DOS 6.x, but
the following problems can occur:

<UL><LI>DoubleSpace cannot be loaded high with RUNHI.

<LI>Setup does not parse lines in CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT that start
   with RUNHI, so you may end up with duplicate driver invocations.
<P>
   For example, if you have RUNHI MOUSE.COM in AUTOEXEC.BAT, Setup
   finds that you have a mouse driver loaded and tries to update it,
   but it cannot find the line in AUTOEXEC.BAT where the driver is loaded,
   and adds C:\DOS\MOUSE at the end of AUTOEXEC.BAT. The original line
   is undisturbed.
