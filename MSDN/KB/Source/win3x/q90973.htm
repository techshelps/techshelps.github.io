1. Q. What are the requirements for using Microsoft LAN Manager
      with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups?

   A. Windows for Workgroups is compatible with Microsoft LAN Manager
      versions 1.x and 2.x. We recommend using version 2.1 or later.
      For more information, please refer the section titled "Using
      Network Features Under Windows for Workgroups" in Chapter 6 of
      the "Getting Started" manual.

      To add LAN Manager functionality to Windows for Workgroups, you
      may need to edit both the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. All
      references to the LAN Manager directories must be removed from
      these files. This includes the directory entries for the network
      device drivers in the CONFIG.SYS file and the PATH statement in
      the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Removing the LAN Manager references
      should eliminate errors referring to the protocol manager,
      PROTMAN.DOS.

      Adding LAN Manager connectivity to Windows for Workgroups
      provides most of the additional LAN Manager features; however,
      network pop-up messaging services are not available.

2. Q. How can I connect to Microsoft LAN Manager resources using
      Microsoft Windows for Workgroups?

   A. You can add the Microsoft LAN Manager network-specific features
      either during or after Windows for Workgroups setup. If you have
      already installed Windows for Workgroups, use the following five
      steps. If you are adding LAN Manager during setup, skip steps 1
      and 2.

      1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon.

      2. At the bottom of the Network Settings dialog box, choose
         the Networks button.

      3. In the Available Network Types box, select Microsoft LAN
         Manager, then choose the Add button.

      4. After you provide the appropriate files from the Setup
         disks, Microsoft LAN Manager appears in the box titled "Other
         Networks In Use." Choose the OK button.

      5. Choose the OK button again. You must restart Windows
         before the change can take effect.

      Your LAN Manager server may be running protocols in addition to
      those you have already installed. Windows for Workgroups
      supports only the NetBEUI protocol.

3. Q. How do you connect to Microsoft LAN Manager drives and
      printers using Windows for Workgroups?

   A. To connect to LAN Manager drives and printers, you must have
      access rights for those servers and their resources. To view LAN
      Manager servers in a LAN Manager domain, at least one Windows
      for Workgroups server must have a workgroup name identical to
      the name of the LAN Manager domain. If you cannot view LAN
      Manager drives and printers in the Connect Network Drive and
      Connect Network Printer dialog boxes, you can manually enter the
      server name and directory in the Path box. The proper syntax for
      this entry is "\\&lt;servername&gt;\&lt;directoryname&gt;" (without the
      quotation marks).

      To connect to LAN Manager servers for disk and printer access,
      your workstation must use the same protocols. If you do not know
      which protocols your LAN Manager server uses, check with the
      system administrator.

4. Q. How can I determine which protocols are installed on my
      computer?

   A. To determine which protocols are configured on your computer,
      use the following two steps:

      1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon.

      2. In the Network Settings dialog box, choose the Adapters
         button.

      The protocols are listed in parentheses beside the network
      adapter card name. Windows for Workgroups supports only the
      NetBEUI protocol.
