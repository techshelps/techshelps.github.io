The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows MIDI Mapper provides a way for users to customize MIDI
setups to meet the special needs of their MIDI systems. For proper MIDI
file playing, you must have the correct MIDI setup selected.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MIDI files played with the Media Player (MPLAYER.EXE) application
supplied with Windows 3.1 are played according to the configuration of
the current MIDI setup, NOT the current value of the patch maps or key
maps that appear in the Names box.
<P>
The patch maps and key maps that are used are specified within each
MIDI setup. Changing the current patch map setting that is visible
from the MIDI Mapper Show Patch Maps option in the Name box will not
affect the patch map that is used by the Media Player unless the
current MIDI setup uses that patch map. The same functionality applies
to the Key Maps setting of the Show option of the MIDI Mapper.
<P>
If Media Player is not playing MIDI files correctly, the current MIDI
setup may need to be changed or a custom (new) MIDI setup may need to
be created for the system.
<P>
Use the information below to determine if a suitable MIDI map exists
for the system, or to create a new MIDI map.
<P>
<P><h3>Determining the Current MIDI Setup</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Run Control Panel.

<P><LI>Run the MIDI Mapper application. If the MIDI Mapper icon is not
   present, this indicates that no MIDI-compatible driver is
   installed. Before proceeding, you must correct this problem by
   installing a MIDI-compatible driver using the Drivers application
   within the Control Panel.

<P><LI>After the MIDI Mapper starts, change to Show Setups by pressing
   ALT+S. The current MIDI Mapper setup will be displayed in the Name
   box.
<P>
</OL><h3>Components of a MIDI Map</h3>
 
<P>
A MIDI map is composed of four components:

<OL><P><LI>Dest Chan (Destination Channel): The channel used by the
   synthesizer to play the sounds on the source channel.

<P><LI>Port Name: The MIDI output port that the sounds on the source
   channel are sent to or played on. A correct value in this box is
   key to producing desired results. Determining the correct port name
   is discussed later in this article.

<P><LI>Patch Map Name: The name of the patch map to be used with the
   source channel. Patch maps are used to define which instruments are
   to be used with the MIDI device. Different patch maps can be
   assigned for each channel through this field.

<P><LI>Active: Determines if MIDI information from the source channel is
   sent to the port.
<P>
</OL><h3>Choosing Which Channels to Configure</h3>
 
<P>
A few general guidelines are offered below. Consult the sound card
manufacturer to determine which channels the sound card supports if
MIDI files do not sound correct when used according to the guidelines
below.
<P>
FM Synthesizers will work best with the last four channels, 13-16.
Common sound cards in this category are the Media Vision Thunder Board
and the Sound Blaster I and II cards.
<P>
MIDI cards with genuine synthesizers (based on actual sampled sounds)
will work best with the first ten channels, 1-10. Common sound cards
in this category are the Roland LAPC-1, Roland Sound Canvas, and
Turtle Beach MultiSound card.
<P>
<P><h3>Examining MIDI Port Settings of a MIDI Map</h3>
 
<P>
The proper port should be verified for each channel supported by the
MIDI device. If no sounds are played from Media Player with MIDI
files, check the port settings of the MIDI map very carefully. Many
sound cards have multiple ports and the correct one should be chosen.
<P>
For example, the Media Vision Pro AudioSpectrum card supports two MIDI
ports: one for connecting an external MIDI connector box through a
15-pin connector, the other for an internal FM synthesizer.
<P>
When editing a MIDI map, view the port settings supported by the
synthesizer by highlighting the Port Name box and examining the list
box (press ALT+DOWN ARROW). This reveals the port options for the Pro
AudioSpectrum card:
<P>
<PRE>   Pro Audio MIDI Output
   Media Vision FM Synth

</PRE></OL>In this case, the Pro Audio MIDI Output option is the external MIDI
port, and the Media Vision FM Synth option is for the built-in MIDI
synthesizer connected to the same speakers that generate output for
.WAV files.
<P>
If nothing is connected to the external MIDI port, no MIDI sounds will
play if this port is selected. If .WAV files can play (startup sounds,
and so on), then an internal synthesizer should be able to be selected
if the card supports MIDI.
<P>
<P><h3>Problems Playing Certain MIDI Files</h3>
 
<P>
Not all MIDI files are the same. Depending on how the MIDI file was
authored or created, the MIDI file might contain MIDI information on
channels other than those supported by the MIDI device. Usually a MIDI
file will contain data on channels 1-10 or 13-16. If no output is
produced, create a MIDI map that uses all channels. (The MIDI file
supplied with Windows 3.1, CANYON.MID, contains MIDI information on
all channels.)
<P>
For more information, see pages 185-198 in the "Microsoft Windows
User's Guide" version 3.1 manual.
