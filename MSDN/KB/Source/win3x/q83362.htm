The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Every time a Windows-based application is opened after being closed,
its display window will appear slightly lower and to the right of the
screen.
<P>
This will occur even if there are no other applications running.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This is known as the "cascading" effect. This behavior is by design to
prevent most applications from hiding previous Windows. In most
programs, the application window will show in such a way that part of
the required display will not show completely. Solitaire, for example,
will not display some of the cards. If the application is then closed
and reopened multiple times, it will eventually show in such a
position where its display will be optimal.
<P>
In Windows 3.1 the cascading effect can still be observed in the
following applications: Paintbrush, Write, Notepad, Terminal,
Cardfile, Calendar, Clipboard, Sound Recorder, and Object Packager.
<P>
This behavior is only characteristic of some Windows applications. In
Windows 3.0, only the File Manager and the PIF Editor will not cascade
(File Manager will not allow more than one instance at the same time).
<P>
Other Windows-based applications such as Word and Excel will also
behave in the same manner. The only way to reset the original position
for all applications is to exit Windows and start it again.
