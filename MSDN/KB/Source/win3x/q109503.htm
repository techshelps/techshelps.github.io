1.0  General Notes

<UL><LI>Many settings in the SYSTEM.INI file affect the way Windows for
   Workgroups works. You can change these settings to correct most
   problems you might have while you are using Windows for Workgroups
   and other networks. See the SYSINI.WRI online document for
   information about changing the following SYSTEM.INI settings:
<P>
</UL>[Boot]
Network.drv=
SecondNet.drv=
<P>
[386Enh]
32BitAccess=
AllVMsExclusive=
EMMExclude=
FileSysChange=
InDOSPolling=
Int28Critical=
NetAsyncFallback=
NetAsyncTimeout=
NetCard=
NetDMASize=
NetHeapSize=
NetMisc=
Network=
ReflectDOSInt2A=
SecondNet=
TimerCriticalSection=
Transport=
TokenRingSearch=
V86ModeLANAs=
UniqueDOSPSP=
<P>
[network]
EnableSharing=
Exclude=
FileSharing=
LANAs=
LogonValidated=
Multinet=
PrintSharing=
Reshare=

<UL><LI>The Windows for Workgroups Setup program places the following lines
   in your SYSTEM.INI file that are required for Windows for Workgroups
   to run correctly. Do not remove any of the following entries:
<P>
</UL>[boot]
network.drv=wfwnet.drv
<P>
[386Enh]
network=*vnetbios,vnetsup.386,vredir.386,vserver.386,*vwc
<P>
If you have upgraded over a previous version of Windows 3.1 or Windows for
Workgroups 3.1 with an installed network, Setup may leave unnecessary
files, causing performance problems or incorrect network behavior. If you
experience network problems and have any of these lines in your SYSTEM.INI
file (or WIN.INI file), try removing the lines to see if the problem can be
corrected.
<P>
In the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
[386Enh]
INDOSPolling=TRUE
EMMExclude=D800-DFFF (or other memory range)
TimerCriticalSection=5000 (or other value)
UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
PSPIncrement=5
NetHeapSize=76 (or other value)
NetAsynchTimeout=50
NetAsynchFallback=true
PerVMFiles=0
OverlappedIO=off
<P>
In the WIN.INI file:
<P>
load=winpopup.exe
load=nwpopup.exe
<P>
[ports]
LPT1.DOS=
LPT2.DOS=
LPT3.DOS=

<UL><LI>Many protocols and other networks require the TimerCriticalSection
   line in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file to be set to a
   value of 10000 or greater. For more information, see the SYSINI.WRI
   online document.

<LI>The default value for the NetHeapSize line in the [386Enh] section
   of the SYSTEM.INI file is 16K. Although some applications require
   this value, in most cases you can decrease the value to 4K in order
   to increase the amount of memory available to your applications. A
   few applications require the value to be 4K.

<LI>If you want to change your network configuration, use Windows Setup
   to make the changes.

<LI>Some network adapters require the EMMExclude line in the [386Enh]
   section of the SYSTEM.INI file to be set to the memory range used by
   the adapter. For more information, see your network-adapter
   documentation and the SYSINI.WRI online document.
<P>
   These cards may also require an x= option on the EMM386 command line
   in your CONFIG.SYS file. For more information, see Appendix C,
   "Troubleshooting," in the Microsoft Workgroup Add-On "User's Guide." If
   you are using 386Max, QEMM, or another memory manager, see your
   memory-manager documentation to find out whether you need to exclude
   this area.

<LI>The Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Resource Kit contains additional
   information about setting up and configuring Windows for Workgroups
   for use with other networks and information for system
   administrators. This kit provides complete technical information
   about Windows for Workgroups for the support professional. It
   includes a technical reference manual and a disk containing helpful
   utilities, drivers, and accessories.
<P>
   If you currently own the Windows for Workgroups 3.1 Resource Kit, an
   addendum is available. It provides information about the new features
   and enhancements available in Windows for Workgroups 3.11.
<P>
   To order the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Resource Kit or the Windows
   for Workgroups Resource Kit Addendum for Version 3.11 within the
   United States, dial:
<P>
   1-800-642-7676
<P>
   To order outside of the United States, dial the phone number for your
   area. You can find this number on the International Subsidiary card.

<LI>If you are running a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups from a
   network drive, make sure both your personal Windows directory and the
   shared network directory are included on the path command line in
   your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. To run a shared copy of Windows for
   Workgroups, you must start the network before starting Windows for
   Workgroups. (When you start the network before you start Windows for
   Workgroups, about 100K less conventional memory is available.)

<LI>If you used setup /n to set up a shared copy of Windows for
   Workgroups and you specified a network directory for your personal
   Windows directory, you cannot start the network (real-mode
   redirector) before you start Windows for Workgroups unless you first
   copy your SYSTEM.INI file to the directory on your hard disk where
   NET.EXE is located. NET.EXE should be located in the root directory
   of your startup drive.
<P>
   Also, if you used setup /n to set up your shared copy of Windows for
   Workgroups over a Windows NT or LAN Manager network, you will not be
   able to share your files or printers.  This is because you need to
   Microsoft Windows Network by using the real-mode redirector, and you
   cannot share files or printers with the real-mode redirector.  For
   more information, see the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Resource Kit.

<LI>If you receive sharing violations while running a shared copy of
   Windows for Workgroups, make sure that all of the files in the shared
   network directory are marked as read-only.

<LI>The NetBEUI protocol is the only protocol included with Windows
   for Workgroups that can be used with the Microsoft Windows Network
   from the DOS prompt. All others can be used only while Windows for
   Workgroups is running. If you will be using the Microsoft Windows
   Network from the DOS prompt, make sure the NetBEUI protocol is one of
   the protocols you are using.

<LI>Windows Print Manager spools print jobs to the location specified
   by the MS-DOS environment variable TEMP. If the TEMP variable is not
   set, Print Manager will use the root of drive C.  The TEMP variable
   may be set by placing a set temp= statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
   or network login script. For example, to spool to the network
   directory C:\WINDOWS\TEMP, you would use the statement set
   temp=c:\windows\temp. Each user must have a personal TEMP directory.
<P>
<P>
</UL>2.0  Using Novell NetWare
<P>
For information about setting up Novell NetWare support in Windows
for Workgroups, see Chapter 9, "Using Other Networks," in the
Microsoft Workgroup Add-On "User's Guide."
<P>
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 supports NDIS, IPX, and ODI
network-adapter drivers.
<P>
If you are upgrading from Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and you were
using the MSIPX drivers that were included with Windows for
Workgroups 3.1, you should use either the IPX.COM driver or the
IPXODI.COM driver supplied by Novell. We recommend that you use
IPXODI.COM. To do this, see the following section, "Setting up Novell
NetWare to Work With Windows for Workgroups 3.11."
<P>
Once you have set up Novell NetWare to work with either the IPX.COM
driver or the IPXODI.COM driver, remove NetWare support from Windows
for Workgroups. Then reinstall NetWare support. This will give you
the option to choose either IPX.COM or IPXODI.COM.
<P>
2.1 Setting Up Novell NetWare to Work with Windows for Workgroups 3.11
<P>
We recommend that you set up Novell NetWare to work with the
IPXODI.COM driver. However, the IPX.COM monolithic driver is also
supported.
<P>
Note:
If you are using IPXODI.COM, you must make sure that your copies of
IPXODI.COM and LSL.COM are versions 1.20 or higher. Otherwise,
Windows for Workgroups will not be able to run.
<P>
<P>
To set up Novell NetWare on your computer:

<OL><P><LI>If you are setting up Novell NetWare version 4.0 or higher, add
   the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      lastdrive=z
</PRE><P>
   Otherwise, add the line lastdrive=p. This will make your login drive Q:

<P><LI>If you are installing Novell NetWare to work with IPXODI.COM, add
   the following lines to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd c:\&lt;NetWare directory&gt;
      lsl
      &lt;appropriate ODI driver for your network card&gt;
      ipxodi
      netx /ps=&lt;preferred server name&gt;
      q:login &lt;username&gt;
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    If you are installing Novell NetWare to work with IPX.COM, add the
    following lines to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       ipx
       netx /ps=&lt;preferred server name&gt;
       q:login &lt;username&gt;
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the name of your NetWare directory to the PATH line in your
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<P><LI>Create a NET.CFG file in your NetWare directory. See your NetWare
   documentation for information on how to do this.
<P>
   This is a sample NET.CFG file:
<P>
   Link Driver EXP16ODI
<PRE>        Frame Ethernet_802.3
        Frame Ethernet_II
        Frame Ethernet_802.2
        Frame Ethernet_SNAP
        port 300
        int 5

</PRE><P><LI>Restart your computer. Once you are able to log on to your
   preferred server successfully, you can set up Windows for Workgroups
   to work with NetWare. See the Microsoft Workgroup Add-On "User's Guide"
   for more information.
