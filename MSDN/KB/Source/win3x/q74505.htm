The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There is no built-in setting within Microsoft Write to set the default
font and point size, or to set the default margins. However, it is possible
to create a blank file with the font and point sizes and margins in it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are the steps to set up Write with a default font and point
size and default margins. If you have different printers connected that
have different font capabilities, you may want to have multiple Write
icons, each starting with a font that is compatible with the desired
printer.
<P>
NOTE: The listed fonts within Write are not necessarily compatible
with all printers. Write will update its configuration (within WIN.INI)
with fonts that are addressable through the printer's driver. These fonts
are not changed when using a different printer. Therefore, printing to a
different printer with a font that is not built into that printer results
in the printer using its default font.
<P>
<P><h3>Step to Set Up Default Font Only (Windows 3.0 or 3.0a)</h3>
 
<P>
Edit the [MSWrite] section in the WIN.INI file to default to the desired
font with the Font1 entry. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   [MSWrite]
   Font1=Script,48,255
   Font2=Courier,48,0
   Font3=LinePrinter,48,0

</PRE><h3>Steps to Set Up the Default Font and Point Size for Write</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Run Write.

<P><LI>From the Document menu, choose Page Layout.

<P><LI>Select the margins desired.

<P><LI>From the Character menu, choose Fonts.

<P><LI>Select the font and point size desired.

<P><LI>Type a few spaces for the changes to take effect.

<P><LI>Save the file as a filename such as WRITEFON.WRI, and exit Write.

<P><LI>Highlight the Write icon in Program Manager.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Properties.

<P><LI>Change the command line from
<P>
       WRITE.EXE
<P>
    to:
<P>
       WRITE.EXE WRITEFON.WRI
<P>
    and choose OK.
<P>
</OL>Every time you select the Write icon, it loads WRITEFON.WRI, which contains
the font and point size and margin settings. If you are creating multiple
Write icons for multiple printers, you need to have a unique filename for
each one. For example WRITEFON1.WRI for printer 1 and WRITEFON2.WRI for
printer 2. To ensure that the file is not accidentally overwritten, start
Windows File Manager and change the file attributes to "read only". When
you try to save a document write will inform you that the file is read only
and prompt you to save the file under a different name.
