<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver for Microsoft
Windows 3.0 supports both the HP DeskJet 500 and HP DeskJet PLUS printers.
This printer driver is also completely compatible with the HP DeskJet
printer, but the print speed is slower. The print quality is the same for
all three HP DeskJet printers.
<P>
The HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver can be obtained from HP's
fulfillment center (StarPack). The driver is free if you own an HP DeskJet
500 (the serial number of the printer must be provided) or can be
purchased.
<P>
NOTE: This driver can only be obtained from HP. Microsoft does not
distribute this driver due to licensing agreements.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver incorporates the IntelliFont
Scalable Outline Font system and includes three scalable typefaces from the
HP MasterType Library: CG Times, Courier, and Univers. It can also be used
with additional MasterType Library scalable typefaces.
<P>
The IntelliFont type scaling technology scales and rasterizes the HP
MasterType Library format typefaces on your computer. It has been built
directly into the HP DeskJet 500 printer driver so you do not need HP Type
Director 2.0 to use the scalable HP MasterType Library typefaces. If you
have previously installed any HP MasterType Library typefaces with HP Type
Director 2.0, you need to reinstall these typefaces by using the HP DeskJet
500 Scalable Printer Driver.
<P>
Information for installing HP MasterType Library format typefaces is
available by choosing Troubleshooting from the Help menu in the HP DeskJet
500 Scalable On... dialog box.
<P>
NOTE: The HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver does not support internal
printer fonts, font cartridges, or soft fonts. To access these fonts,
use the HP DeskJet Family printer driver.
<P>
The HP Deskjet 500 does not physically print graphics in landscape mode.
Instead, it sends the graphic out in portrait mode and rotates it to
appear in landscape mode.
<P>
The HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver requires approximately 1 MB of
free disk space for installation of the driver and the three printer fonts
that come with it (Courier, CG Times, and Universe).
<P>
To use the HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver for Microsoft Windows
3.0, do the following through the Windows Control Panel:

<OL><P><LI>Install the driver and its support files on your hard disk.

<P><LI>Select printer settings.

<P><LI>Install printer fonts.

<P><LI>Create screen fonts (optional).

<P><LI>Activate your printer.
<P>
</OL>For information on installing unlisted printer drivers, please refer to
pages 158-174, "Installing a Printer," in the "Microsoft Windows User's
Guide."
<P>
