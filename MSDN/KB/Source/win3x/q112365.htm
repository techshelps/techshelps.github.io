The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article details the information displayed by the NET DIAG /STATUS
command.
<P>
When you run the NET DIAG /STATUS command, it returns information similar
to the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Remote Adapter Status:

   Permanent node name: 00AA003B1DE8

   Adapter operational for 1379 minutes.
   240 Free NCBs out of 255 with 255 the maximum.
   4 Sessions in use
   10 Sessions allocated
   16262 packets transmitted 9070683 packets received.
   5 retransmissions 0 retrys exhausted.
   0 crc errors 0 alignment errors 0 collisions 0 Aborted transmissions.
   name 2 RANDY              status 04
   name 3 WORKGROUP          status 84
   name 4 RANDY          *   status 04
   name 5 RANDY              status 04
   name 6 WORKGROUP      $   status 84
   name 7 RANDY          @   status 04
   name 8 SCOTT          &amp;   status 04
   The command completed successfully.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Permanent node name: 00AA003B1DE8
<P>
   The permanent node name is a unique identifier burned into the ROM on
   your network card. The first six characters identify the vendor (Intel
   in the above example).

<LI>Adapter operational for 1379 minutes.
<P>
   This value indicates how long it has been since the card has been
   initialized. Windows NT does not support this field; therefore, the
   value returned from an NT machine is always zero.

<LI>240 Free NCBs out of 255 with 255 the maximum.
<P>
   This is the number of non-pending NCBs.

<LI>4 Sessions in use
<P>
   This data indicates the number of NetBIOS sessions that have been
   established on this particular lana. A session is essentially a
   communication channel between one machine and another. Two machines
   never have more than one session established with one another,
   regardless of the number of connections.

<LI>10 Sessions allocated
<P>
   The enhanced mode NetBIOS provider dynamically allocates more sessions
   as they are needed. With real-mode transports, you may need to increase
   the number of sessions in the PROTOCOL.INI file if the number of
   sessions in use is nearing the sessions allocated value.

<LI>16262 packets transmitted 9070683 packets received.

<LI>5 retransmissions 0 retries exhausted.
<P>
   The NetBIOS interface retransmits dropped frames a limited number of
   times before it gives up.

<LI>0 crc errors 0 alignment errors 0 collisions 0 Aborted transmissions.
<P>
   These are statistics kept mainly for use by the Macintosh systems.

<LI>name 2 RANDY              status 04
<PRE>   name 3 WORKGROUP          status 84
   name 4 RANDY          *   status 04
   name 5 RANDY              status 04
   name 6 WORKGROUP      $   status 84
   name 7 RANDY          @   status 04
   name 8 SCOTT          &amp;   status 04

   This is the NetBIOS name table. When a redirector, network server, or
   application needs to use the NetBIOS interface, it can, depending on its
   needs, add a name to the list of names in the NetBIOS name table. Two
   major types of names can be added. The first type (status 04) is a
   unique name. Before NetBIOS accepts this name, it sends a NetBIOS
   name query to see if this name currently exists on the network (as
   either status 04 or 84). If it exists, NetBIOS refuses to add the name
   to its own table. The other type (status 84) is a group name. This type
   does not need to be unique and can be used to send a message to a group
   of addresses. NetBIOS also checks to see if this name is registered as
   type 04 on any machine.

   In the above example, the computername is listed four times (each
   unique), the workgroup is listed twice (group names), and the user name
   is listed once. It is likely that the server added several of the
   computer names and the redirector added one computername, one user name,
   and one workgroup name.

   The ASCII characters (* $ @ &amp;) are required because the names are
   registered as unique names. You cannot have two identical names,
   even on your own system. Anything that uses the name table (the server,
   redirector, browser, and so forth) modifies the last byte of the name to
   ensure it is unique. Some names may appear to be identical, but that is
   because the modified last bits happen to print as a blank character.
