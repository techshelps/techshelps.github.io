<P><h2>RECONFIGURING MICROSOFT WINDOWS VERSION 3.11</h2>
 
<P>
This Application Note includes the Windows 3.10 versions of seven core
Windows files. To replace your Windows 3.11 versions of these files, follow
the procedure below that is appropriate to your configuration.
<P>
To Install Windows 3.10 Files over
<P><h3>a Local Installation of Windows 3.11</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Windows.

<P><LI>Create a backup directory. For example, to create a backup directory off
   the root of drive C, type "md c:\oldwin" (without the quotation marks)
   at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Copy the files listed below from your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory
   to the backup directory or a floppy disk.
<P>
<P><PRE>      COMMDLG.DLL
      GDI.EXE
      KRNL386.EXE
      PSCRIPT.DRV
      SHELL.DLL
      UNIDRV.DLL
      USER.EXE
</PRE><P>
   To do this, use the following syntax
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;windir&gt;\system\&lt;filename&gt; &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;backdir&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard disk drive, &lt;windir&gt; is your Windows
   directory, &lt;filename&gt; is the file you are copying, and &lt;backdir&gt; is
   your backup directory.
<P>
   For example, if your hard disk drive is C, your Windows directory
   is named WINDOWS, your backup directory is called OLDWIN, and you
   are copying COMMDLG.DLL, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\windows\system\commdlg.dll c:\oldwin
</PRE><P>
   Repeat this command for the remaining files.
<P>
   NOTE: You may receive the "File not found" error message when you
   try to copy PSCRIPT.DRV or UNIDRV.DLL because these files may not
   be on your system.

<P><LI>Insert the enclosed WW1007 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and then
   press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\*.* &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is your floppy disk drive and &lt;destination&gt; is your
   Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
   For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\*.* c:\windows\system
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: After you copy the new USER.EXE file to your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory, your registered user and company name will be blank.

<P><LI>If you use Novell(R) NetWare(R) connectivity, do the following:
<P>
   a. Use a text editor (such as Windows Notepad) to open your
<P><PRE>      SYSTEM.INI file, which is located in your Windows directory.
</PRE><P>
   b. In the [386Enh] section, change device=vtda.386 to device=*vtd.
<P>
   c. Save the file and quit the text editor.
<P>
</OL>To Install Windows 3.10 Files over
<P><h3>a Network Installation of Windows 3.11</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Determine the location of your SYSTEM.INI file and the network
   share that contains your shared Windows files. For example, if the
   network drive containing your Windows program files is Q, the
   location of your shared Windows files may be Q:\WINSHARE and your
   user directory may be Q:\USER\&lt;YOURNAME&gt; (or your user directory
   may be located on your local hard disk drive).

<P><LI>Quit Microsoft Windows.

<P><LI>Create a backup directory. For example, to create a backup directory off
   the root of drive C, type "md c:\oldwin" (without the quotation marks)
   at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Copy the files below from the network share to the backup directory on
   your hard disk drive using the following syntax at the MS-DOS command
   prompt and then press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;netdrive&gt;:\&lt;netshare&gt;\&lt;filename&gt; &lt;harddrive&gt;:\&lt;backdir&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;netdrive&gt; is the network drive, &lt;netshare&gt; is the network
   share containing your SYSTEM.INI file, &lt;filename&gt; is the file you
   are copying, &lt;harddrive&gt; is your hard disk drive, and &lt;backdir&gt; is
   your backup directory.
<P>
   For example, if your network drive is Q, the network share is
   WINSHARE, the file you want to copy is COMMDLG.DLL, your hard disk
   drive is C, and your backup directory is called OLDWIN, type the
   following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy q:\winshare\commdlg.dll c:\oldwin
</PRE><P>
   Repeat this command for the remaining files:
<P>
<P><PRE>      COMMDLG.DLL
      GDI.EXE
      KRNL386.EXE
      PSCRIPT.DRV
      SHELL.DLL
      UNIDRV.DLL
      USER.EXE
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: After you copy the new USER.EXE file to your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory, your registered user and company name will be blank.

<P><LI>Remove the Read-Only file attributes on the shared Windows files
   using the MS-DOS ATTRIB command.

<P><LI>Insert the enclosed WW1007 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and then
   press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\*.* &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is your floppy disk drive and &lt;destination&gt; is the
   network drive and share.
<P>
   For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\*.* q:\winshare
</PRE>
<P><LI>Reset the Read-Only file attributes on the shared Windows files
   using the MS-DOS ATTRIB command.

<P><LI>If you use Novell NetWare connectivity, do the following:
<P>
   a. Use a text editor (such as Windows Notepad) to open your
<P><PRE>      SYSTEM.INI file.
</PRE><P>
   b. In the [386Enh] section, change device=vtda.386 to device=*vtd.
