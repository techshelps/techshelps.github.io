<P><h3>1.0  Running Windows with an Operating System Other Than MS-DOS</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS work together as an integrated system.
They were designed together and extensively tested together on a wide
variety of computers and hardware configurations. Running Windows
version 3.1 on an operating system other than MS-DOS could cause
unexpected results or poor performance.
<P>
<P><h3>2.0  Preventing Stack Overflow</h3>
 
<P>
Stacks are temporary data structures that MS-DOS and applications use
for processing hardware events. If, while setting up Windows, Setup
detects hardware or software that require a certain stack size, Setup
will place the following command line in your CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
stacks=9,256
<P>
This should be sufficient most of the time. However, if you receive
the Internal Stack Overflow message when running Windows in 386
enhanced mode, or if your system fails for no apparent reason when
running Windows in standard mode (especially if you are setting up or
moving the mouse), first try increasing the second number on the
stacks= command line (for example, 256)  If that doesn't work, try
increasing the first number (for example, 9). For more information
about the stacks setting and modifying the CONFIG.SYS file, see your
MS-DOS documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>3.0  Using 32-Bit Disk Access</h3>
 
<P>
By default, 32-bit disk access is turned off to prevent disk errors on
some battery-powered portable computers. However, 32-bit disk access
may run correctly with some battery-powered portable computers, such
as the Zenith MasterSport SL. If you want to try using 32-bit disk
access, select the 32-bit disk access check box in the Virtual Memory
dialog box (choose the 386 Enhanced option in Control Panel). For more
information, see Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows," in the Microsoft
Windows User's Guide.
<P>
Caution: Before using 32-bit disk access on a battery-powered portable
computer, it is highly recommended that you back up your hard disk.
Because 32-bit Disk Access has not been fully tested on all battery-
powered systems, you may receive disk errors while using it.
<P>
<P><h3>4.0  Using Memory Managers</h3>
 
<P>
This section describes problems you may encounter using memory
managers with Windows
version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>4.1  Solving Memory Conflicts by Using MONOUMB.386 or MONOUMB2.386</h3>
 
<P>
If you encounter the following message when starting Windows in 386
enhanced mode, your display driver may be accessing the monochrome
address range (B000-B7FF), which prevents the memory manager from
using this range for upper memory blocks:
<P>
"Windows cannot set up an upper memory block at segment B000. Exclude
this address space by using the syntax of your memory manager. For
more information, see the README.WRI file. Type WIN /S to start
Windows in standard mode and choose the Read Me icon,"
<P>
To solve this problem, try installing MONOUMB2.386 on your system.
MONOUMB2.386 is a device driver provided with Windows that allows
certain memory managers to use the monochrome address range for upper
memory blocks, even if your display driver is accessing this range.
<P>
To install MONOUMB2.386:

<OL><P><LI> Copy and expand the MONOUMB2.38_ file that is on your Windows disk
<P><PRE>    to your Windows SYSTEM directory by typing the following at the
    MS-DOS prompt:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        expand a:monoumb2.38_ c:\windows\system\monoumb2.386

</PRE><P><LI> Add the following setting to the [386Enh] section in the
<P><PRE>    SYSTEM.INI file:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        device=monoumb2.386

</PRE><P><LI> Start Windows.
<P>
</OL>Note: MONOUMB2.386 may not work with some memory managers, such as
EMM386.EXE. In this case, you can try using MONOUMB.386, provided with
the Windows Driver Library. To obtain a copy of the Windows Driver
Library, contact Microsoft.
<P>
You can also exclude the address region B000-B7FF, which specifies
that the memory manager should not try to use this address range for
upper memory blocks.  For information about excluding specific address
ranges, see the following topic.
<P>
4.2  Solving Memory Conflicts by Excluding an Address Range
<P>
If you encounter the following message when starting Windows in 386
enhanced mode, and the address specified is not B000, you must exclude
the address range.
<P>
"Windows cannot set up an upper memory block at segment xxxx. Exclude
this address space by using the syntax of your memory manager. For
more information, see the README.WRI file. Type WIN /S to start
Windows in standard mode and choose the Read Me icon."
<P>
If the address specified is B000, you can try using MONOUMB2.386 or
MONOUMB.386, as described in the preceding topic.
<P>
The method you use to exclude an address range depends on the memory
manager you are using. For example, if you are using EMM386.EXE, you
need to remove the I=xxxxx option from the device=emm386.exe command
line in your CONFIG.SYS file, where xxxxx is the address range
starting at the address specified in the error message.
<P>
If you are using QEMM, you need to include the X= option on the
device=qemm386.sys command line in your CONFIG.SYS file. For example,
to exclude the address range C000-C7FF, you would specify the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   device=qemm386.sys X=C000-C7FF

</PRE></OL>For more information about modifying your CONFIG.SYS file, see your
MS-DOS documentation. For more information about installing and
configuring EMM386.EXE, see Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows," in the
Microsoft Windows User's Guide. For information about installing
and configuring other memory managers, see the documentation provided
with your memory manager.
<P>
<P><h3>4.3  Using 386MAX</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running 386MAX with Windows version 3.1, note the
following:
<P>
- Do not use options that limit the EMS swap region in the upper
memory area. If you include exclude= options on the 386max or bluemax
command line or in the .PRO file (usually called 386MAX.PRO), make
sure that the address range specified does not extend beyond A000.
<P>
For example, exclude=1800-A000 is acceptable, but exclude=1800-B800 is
not. If the address range specified by using the exclude= option
extends beyond A000, Windows may not run properly in 386 enhanced
mode. If you must exclude an address range above A000, use the
RAM= option instead. For more information about this and other
options, see your 386MAX documentation.
<P>
- Do not load SMARTDrive when QCache is running.
<P>
Note: The 386MAX setup program does not detect SMARTDrive version 4.0
and may recommend that you install QCache.
<P>
- If you update an earlier version of 386MAX to version 6.0, the
386MAX version 6.0 setup program may not remove the LOAD=WINDOWS.LOD
line from your .PRO file. You can remove this line manually. It is not
needed and removing it will free up a small amount of memory.
<P>
<P><h3>5.0  Using Advanced Power Management (APM)</h3>
 
<P>
Windows version 3.1 includes support for Advanced Power Management
(APM). This enables Windows to extend battery life, display power-
status information, and work together with the suspend features of
battery-powered personal computers. To find out if your computer
supports APM, contact your computer manufacturer.
<P>
If your computer supports APM, do the following to install it on your
system:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Windows.

<P><LI>Run Windows Setup and select one of the following system types:
<P>
   - MS-DOS System with APM
   - Intel 386SL Based System with APM
<P>
  Select "Intel 386SL Based System with APM" if your computer has an
  Intel 386SL processor and supports the SL Enhanced Options for APM.
  Otherwise, select "MS-DOS System with APM."

<P><LI> Restart Windows.
<P>
<P><PRE>     A Power icon appears in the Control Panel window.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Choose the Power icon to configure power-management settings.
<P>
</OL>For more information about the settings, press F1 or choose the Help
button while using the Power
Management dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>6.0  Using SMARTDrive Version 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
This section describes some solutions to problems that you might
encounter when using SMARTDrive version 4.0 (provided with Windows
version 3.1) together with specific applications or hardware.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>6.1  Accessing Floppy Disk Drives on Older COMPAQ DESKPROS</h3>
 
<P>
On some COMPAQ DESKPRO 386/16 and 386/20 computers, you might
experience problems accessing floppy disks when SMARTDrive version 4.0
is installed. To work around the problem, you can try one of the
following solutions:
<P>
- Place the SMARTDrive buffer into low memory by adding the following
option to the smartdrv command line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
<PRE>      smartdrv /L

</PRE></OL>- Disable the caching on floppy disk drives by adding the following
options to the smartdrv command line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
<PRE>      smartdrv A- B-

</PRE>For more information about these options, see Chapter 14, "Optimizing
Windows," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>6.2  Using SMARTDrive with Double Buffering</h3>
 
<P>
Most expanded-memory emulators attempt to optimize SMARTDrive by
configuring it to load into upper memory blocks (UMBs). This will
cause problems if you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode with
double buffering. If you need to use double buffering with SMARTDrive,
make sure that SMARTDrive is configured in the CONFIG.SYS file to load
into low memory. The command line should look like this:
<P>
<PRE>        device=smartdrv.exe /double_buffer

</PRE>This problem applies only to the smartdrv command line in the
CONFIG.SYS file. It does not apply to the references to SMARTDrive in
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For more information about using double
buffering with SMARTDrive, see Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows," in
the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>6.3  Using SMARTDrive with Norton Utilities Version 6.0 Disk Monitor</h3>
 
<P>
Do not use the Disk Protect feature in Norton Utilities Version 6.0
Disk Monitor with SMARTDrive version 4.0. If you try to write to the
protected drive, you will encounter an error and your system will
fail. If you want to write to and cache a protected drive, add the
drive letter to the smartdrv command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
For example, if drive D is a protected drive, you would add the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   smartdrv d

</PRE>Or you can use the Norton cache program instead when using Disk
Monitor.
<P>
<P><h3>6.4  Using SMARTDrive with SuperStor Disk-Compression Utility</h3>
 
<P>
-  Do not use the Create Mountable Drive, Mount, and Dismount features
of SuperStor after SMARTDrive is loaded. You must configure your
SuperStor partitions before loading SMARTDrive. Windows Setup places
the smartdrv command line first in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file includes "mount" configuration commands, make sure
that the smartdrv command line follows the SuperStor configuration
command lines.
<P>
-  Also, you will receive read-write errors if you use SMARTDrive to
cache a SuperStor compressed drive. To prevent SMARTDrive from caching
the compressed drive, you must include the drive letter- option on the
smartdrv command line.
<P>
For example, if drive C is the uncompressed drive, and drives E and F
are the compressed SuperStor drives, you would include the following
command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
<PRE>        smartdrv e- f-

</PRE><h3>6.5  Using SMARTDrive with Copy-Protected Games and Applications</h3>
 
<P>
When using SMARTDrive, you may encounter problems starting a copy-
protected application that requires you to place the master disk in
the floppy disk drive. To solve this problem, you need to disable
caching on the floppy disk drive by using the drive letter - option
when you load SMARTDrive. For example, if you load SMARTDrive from
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and are using drive A, you need to include the
following command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
<PRE>   smartdrv a-

</PRE><h3>7.0  Using Multimedia Extensions Version 1.0 with Windows Version 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
This section covers information that is specific to using the
Multimedia Extensions version 1.0 with Windows version 3.1. It also
covers additional tasks you need to perform to configure your system
properly for use with the multimedia extensions.
<P>
<P><h3>7.1  Upgrading to Windows Version 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
To use the multimedia extensions with Windows version 3.1, first set
up Windows with Multimedia version 1.0, and then upgrade to Windows
version 3.1 by installing it into the same directory. If you set up
Windows version 3.1 before setting up Windows with Multimedia, not all
the files will be properly installed.
<P>
<P><h3>7.2  Configuring MIDI Setups</h3>
 
<P>
When you set up Windows version 3.1, Setup copies the multimedia
extensions MIDI-setup file MIDIMAP.CFG to MIDIMAP.OLD, and then
replaces it with an updated version. This version contains several new
MIDI setups that support playing MIDI information authored according
to General MIDI guidelines. If you want to use a setup in the new
MIDIMAP.CFG file and are using sound drivers that are not provided by
Windows, you will need to change the port settings to match the ports
used by your sound device. To do this, use the MIDI Mapper option in
Control Panel.
<P>
You can also use the original MIDIMAP.CFG file (renamed by Setup to
MIDIMAP.OLD). You might want to do this if the original file contains
custom MIDI setups that you created yourself or that were provided by
your sound-device manufacturer. To use the original file, rename
MIDIMAP.CFG to MIDIMAP.WIN, and then rename MIDIMAP.OLD to
MIDIMAP.CFG. If the port settings in your original setups refer to the
Ad Lib or Sound Blaster ports and you are using different drivers,
then you will need to change the port settings to match the output
ports used by your sound device.
<P>
For more information about using MIDI Mapper to modify MIDI setups,
see Chapter 5, "Control Panel," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>7.3  Configuring Your Display</h3>
 
<P>
The multimedia extensions Display icon in Control Panel is not
available when you upgrade from Windows with Multimedia version 1.0 to
Windows version 3.1. If you need to change options for your display,
use the Windows Setup application in the Main group in Program Manager
to make these changes.
<P>
<P><h3>7.4  Sample MIDI File</h3>
 
<P>
The sample MIDI file CANYON.MID included with Windows version 3.1 that
you can play with Windows Media Player is provided by Passport
Designs, Inc.
<P>
<P><h3>7.5  Using HyperGuide</h3>
 
<P>
The information in HyperGuide refers to Windows version 3.0, not
Windows version 3.1. If you need to use Windows documentation, see the
Microsoft Windows User's Guide that comes with Windows version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>7.6  Using Music Box</h3>
 
<P>
Music Box is not fully compatible with Windows version 3.1. Although
your compact discs will play correctly, you will encounter problems
using the Save Info button in the Program dialog box to save disc-
title and track-title information. If you want to modify this
information, you must do so manually by editing the MUSICBOX.INI file.
To add a new disc to the file, you can determine the disc ID number by
viewing the information in the About dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>7.7  Using Alarm Clock</h3>
 
<P>
The Alarm Clock in the Multimedia Extensions version 1.0 is not fully
compatible with Windows version 3.1. If you are using the digital
display, the time may appear slanted or a system error may occur,
depending on the size of the Alarm Clock window.
<P>
<P><h3>8.0  Running Specific Non-Windows Applications</h3>
 
<P>
This section provides general information about running applications
in Windows version 3.1. It also describes problems you might encounter
while running specific non-Windows applications with Windows version
3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>8.1  Communications Applications</h3>
 
<P>
For best results when running a non-Windows communications application
in the background, run it as an icon instead of in a window. Also,
create a PIF (program information file) for the non-Windows
Communications application (if one does not already exist) and do the
following:
<P>
- Select the Execute: Background check box.
<P>
- If you encounter errors during file transfers while running the
<PRE>  application in the background, increase the Background Priority
  option in the Advanced Options dialog box.

</PRE>- If you use a permanent swap file with 32-bit disk access, select the
<PRE>  Lock Application Memory check box in the Advanced Options dialog
  box.

</PRE>For information about using and creating PIFs, see Chapter 8, "PIF
Editor,"in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>8.2  Creative Labs JukeBox</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a Sound Blaster sound card, do not set up or use the
JukeBox application included in your Sound Blaster package with
Windows version 3.1.  JukeBox interferes with the Windows version 3.1
driver for the Ad Lib synthesizer and causes errors when you try to
install the drivers for the Sound Blaster card.
<P>
<P><h3>8.3  Game or Timing-Sensitive Applications</h3>
 
<P>
Some game applications or applications that rely on the computer's
timer may perform poorly in Windows version 3.1. You can try
increasing the performance by turning off the TrapTimerPorts
setting in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   TrapTimerPorts=Off

</PRE>Note: The TrapTimerPorts setting is on by default. Turning it off may
cause errors or a loss of data when transferring files by using a
communications application. It is recommended that you leave this
setting turned on when using a communications application.
<P>
<P><h3>8.4  Third-Party Expanded-Memory Emulators with MS-DOS Version 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
Many expanded-memory emulators will cause problems if you use them to
provide upper memory blocks (UMBs) for the MS-DOS version 5.0 loadhigh
and devicehigh commands. If you want to use these MS-DOS commands to
load drivers or applications high, then use the Windows EMM386.EXE
expanded-memory emulator to provide UMBs instead. If you must use a
third-party expanded-memory emulator, then use the load high feature
provided with the emulator, instead of the MS-DOS commands.
<P>
<P><h3>8.5  PC Tools Applications</h3>
 
<P>
If you run a PC Tools non-Windows application in a window, or if you
switch to it while Windows is running in standard mode, the display
might be garbled, because PC Tools applications use a graphics font
that is not displayed correctly (this problem does not occur if you
run the application in a full screen when Windows is running in 386
enhanced mode).
<P>
To correct the problem, start your PC Tools non-Windows applications
by using the /NF option. If your PC Tools non-Windows applications are
included in a Program Manager group, use the Properties command to add
the /NF option to the command line for the application. For more
information about changing application properties, see Chapter 3,
"Program Manager," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.
<P>
You can also include the /NF option in the application's program
information file (PIF) by typing it in the Optional Parameters text
box in PIF Editor, or you can use the PC Tools PC Config program to
specify that PC Tools applications should use the Text Font to display
information. For more information about changing an application's PIF,
see Chapter 8, "PIF Editor," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

<P><h3>9.0  Using Specific Display Adapters with Windows Version 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
This section describes some problems you might encounter using
specific display adapters or drivers with Windows version 3.1.
<P>
9.1  Installing Display Adapters by
<P><h3>Following the Manufacturer's Instructions</h3>
 
<P>
The procedures that are provided by display-adapter manufacturers for
installing display adapters may require you to replace or modify the
SETUP.INF file in the Windows SYSTEM directory. This will cause
problems in Windows version 3.1.
<P>
If your third-party display installation replaces or modifies the
SETUP.INF file, follow these instructions instead to install the
display-adapter drivers:

<OL><P><LI> Rename the SETUP.INF file provided with your display-adapter
</OL>package to OEMSETUP.INF, and place it on the disk and in the directory
containing the third-party display driver files.

<OL><P><LI> Run Windows Setup from the Main group and select Other Display
</OL>(Requires disk from OEM) from the list of Display options.

<OL><P><LI> Insert the disk that contains the OEMSETUP.INF file and the driver
</OL>files for your display adapter. Or, if these files are located on your
hard disk, type the path to the directory that contains the files in
the text box, and then choose the OK button.

<OL><P><LI> Select the type of display adapter you want to use, and then
</OL>choose the OK button. Windows Setup copies all necessary files from
the driver disk, and may request files from the Setup disks.

<OL><P><LI> Insert any additional disks that are requested, and then choose
</OL>the OK button.
<P>
If you accidentally overwrite the original SETUP.INF file, you can
copy it from Setup Disk 3 back into your Windows SYSTEM directory.
<P>
<P><h3>9.2  Upgrading Display Drivers When Using Soft-Font Packages</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using certain soft-font packages, including Bitstream
Facelift, Publisher PowerPak, and Hewlett-Packard Intellifont, Windows
Setup may not update your display driver when you upgrade to Windows
version 3.1. In this case, you need to update your display driver
after you have set up Windows. To do this, run Windows Setup from the
Main group, and then select the display driver you want to use from
the list of Display options. For more information about using Setup
after you have installed Windows, see Chapter 15, "Maintaining Windows
with Setup," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>9.3  Using Self-Configuring Display Adapters</h3>
 
<P>
Some display adapters can change their configurations to match what an
application tries to do. For example, if an application tries to use a
video graphics adapter (VGA) configuration and your display adapter is
currently configured as an extended graphics adapter (EGA), the
adapter can switch from an EGA configuration to a VGA configuration.
This type of display adapter makes use of non-maskable interrupts
(NMIs) to change its configuration while you work.
<P>
To use this type of display adapter with Windows running in 386
enhanced mode, you must disable the NMI (also called self-configuring,
auto-switching, or auto-emulating) option. First, configure
the display adapter, and then disable the NMI option. For more
information, see your display-adapter documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>9.4  Hercules Graphics Station</h3>
 
<P>
Hercules Graphics Station adapters are supported by Windows version
3.1 using the TIGA display drivers. If you encounter problems running
Windows in 386 enhanced mode with the Hercules GS, try adding the
following line to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   emmexclude=C000-CFFF

</PRE></OL>For more information about modifying settings in the SYSTEM.INI file,
see the SYSINI.WRI online document.
<P>
<P><h3>9.5  LCD</h3>
 
<P>
If you use an LCD screen, set it for white text on a black background
instead of black text on a white background. When using Windows, black
text on a white background wears out LCD screens. See the
documentation for your screen for instructions on how to do this.
<P>
<P><h3>9.6  Super VGA</h3>
 
<P>
- If you are using a video card and monitor (NEC MultiSync 3D/4D/5D or
other multifrequency monitor) capable of 800x600, 16-color resolution
with a third-party Super VGA driver, or one of the following drivers
provided in the Windows 3.0 Supplemental Driver Library (SDL):
<P>
- ATI Mode 54h (800x600 16 colors) v2.00
- CHIPS Super VGA 82C451 (800x600 16 colors)
- CHIPS Super VGA 82C452 (800x600 16 colors)
- Paradise VGA (800x600 16 colors)
<P>
use the Super VGA (800x600, 16 colors) driver provided with Windows
instead. If you do not update your driver, Windows may not work
properly when running in 386 enhanced mode. In addition, the 3.1
driver contains new features and performance enhancements.
<P>
To install the Windows version 3.1 Super VGA driver, run Windows Setup
from the Main group, and then select "Super VGA 800x600, 16 colors"
from the list of Display options. For more information on using Setup
after you have installed Windows, see Chapter 15, "Maintaining Windows
with Setup," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.
<P>
- Super VGA VESA Mode 6Ah
<P>
Some Super VGA adapters support higher monitor-refresh rates at
800x600 resolution with a special VESA mode. If both your video
adapter and monitor support a higher refresh rate and if you are using
the Super VGA driver, you may be able to get better video results by
including the following setting in the [display] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   svgamode=106

</PRE>If you encounter problems using this mode, delete this setting from
the SYSTEM.INI file, and then restart Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>9.7  Third-Party Display Drivers: Running Non-Windows Applications</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a display driver that is not provided with Windows
version 3.1 and you receive one of the following messages while trying
to run a non-Windows application:
<P>
"Incorrect system version. Run the Windows Setup program again."
<PRE>        or
</PRE>"386 System display type mismatch."
<P>
contact your display manufacturer for an updated driver. You can also
solve this problem manually by installing 3.0 driver files. These
files are included on the Windows and MS-DOS Setup disks.
<P>
If your display driver works in Windows version 3.0 using the standard
VGA virtual-display-device file (specified by the device=*vddvga
setting in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file), then do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Copy and expand the VDDVGA30.386 file from the Windows and MS-DOS
   Setup disks to your Windows 3.1 SYSTEM directory.

<P><LI>Change the display= setting in the [386Enh] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file to: display=VDDVGA30.386

<P><LI>Restart Windows.
<P>
</OL>If your display driver works in Windows version 3.0 using the standard
VGA grabber file (specified by the 386Grabber=VGA.GR3 setting in the
[boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file), then do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Copy and expand the VGA30.3GR file from the Windows and MS-DOS
   Setup disks to your Windows 3.1 SYSTEM directory.

<P><LI>Change the 386Grabber setting in the [386Enh] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file to: 386Grabber=VGA30.3GR

<P><LI>Restart Windows.
<P>
</OL><h3>9.8  TIGA</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a Texas Instruments Graphics Architecture (TIGA)-
based display adapter, make sure that you are using a TIGA display
driver that is provided by Windows version 3.1. Windows provides two
versions of the TIGA display driver, "TIGA (Small fonts)" and "TIGA
(Large fonts)."
<P>
To install one of the drivers, run Windows Setup from the Main group,
and then select the version you want from the list of Display options.
For more information on using Setup after you have installed Windows,
see Chapter 15, "Maintaining Windows with Setup," in the Microsoft
Windows User's Guide.
<P>
Note: You cannot use Windows Setup to change TIGA screen resolution.
If you want to change the resolution, you must first quit Windows, and
then use the TIGAMODE utility or another resolution utility supplied
with your display adapter. Unless you want to use a different version
of the TIGA driver (Small fonts or Large fonts) to change font sizes,
it is not necessary to run Windows Setup after changing your TIGA
screen resolution.
<P>
<P><h3>9.9  VGA-Compatible</h3>
 
<P>
Most VGA-compatible display-adapter cards and main-adapter chips use
additional memory to enhance their performance. When Windows is
running in 386 enhanced mode and is configured for VGA, Windows
detects most of these cards and automatically excludes the additional
memory.
<P>
However, if you have an enhanced VGA that Windows does not recognize,
you must exclude the additional memory yourself by adding the
following line to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   emmexclude=C400-C7FF

</PRE></OL>For more information about modifying the SYSTEM.INI file, see the
SYSINI.WRI online document.
<P>
<P><h3>9.10  Video Seven: Using 256-Color Support</h3>
 
<P>
Windows version 3.1 provides 256-color support at several resolutions
for Video Seven display adapters that have at least 512K of video
memory. The following table shows the Video Seven 256-color modes that
are supported by the Video Seven display drivers provided with Windows
version 3.1.
<P>
<PRE>Model                   640x480     720x512     800x600     1024x768

FastWrite 512K            Yes
1024i 512K                Yes
VRAM 512K                 Yes         Yes
VRAM II 512K              Yes         Yes
VRAM II 1MB               Yes         Yes         Yes          Yes

</PRE>If you are using a Video Seven display adapter that has at least 512K
of video memory, you should use one of the Video Seven display drivers
for 256-color video provided with Windows version 3.1. These drivers
take full advantage of the performance improvements and mouse support
in non-Windows applications. To install one of the drivers, run
Windows Setup from the Main group, and then select the driver you want
from the list of Display options. For more information about using
Setup after you have installed Windows, see Chapter 15, "Maintaining
Windows with Setup," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>9.11  WinSpeed</h3>
 
<P>
The WinSpeed version 1.0 installation program, INSTALL.EXE, does not
work properly with Windows version 3.1. It copies an incompatible
version of the SETUP.INF file to your Windows directory. To install
WinSpeed for use with Windows version 3.1, you must get updated
installation disks from Panacea.
<P>
If you have already used the INSTALL.EXE program to install the
WinSpeed drivers onto your system, the following message will appear
when you try to run Windows Setup from the Main group:
<P>
"The SETUP.INF file on your system is not valid for use with this
version of Setup."
<P>
To correct this problem, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>If there is a SETUP.INF file in your Windows directory, delete it.
   (The SETUP.INF file should never be in your Windows directory.)

<P><LI>Copy the SETUP.INF file on Setup Disk 3 to your Windows SYSTEM
   directory.

<P><LI>Contact Panacea Inc. for updated WinSpeed installation disks that
   are compatible with Windows version 3.1, and then reinstall
   WinSpeed.
<P>
</OL><h3>9.12  IBM XGA: Configuring Color and Resolution</h3>
 
<P>
Windows Setup will automatically configure an IBM XGA for 16-color,
640x480 resolution. If your monitor can support 256 colors or higher
resolutions, you can configure your XGA to use the color and
resolution settings you want. To do this, run Windows Setup from the
Main group, and then select one of the following drivers from the list
of Display options:
<P>
- XGA (640x480, 16 colors)
<P>
This is the default setting and should not be changed if you are using
the plasma screen on the PS/2 model 75.
<P>
- XGA (640x480, 256 colors)
- XGA (Small fonts)
- XGA (Large fonts)
<P>
Both the Small and Large fonts settings configure the XGA for 1024x786
resolution and 256 colors, if your monitor supports it. Otherwise
these settings configure your display for 640x480 resolution. Select
Small Fonts if you have a large monitor (at least 16 inches) or want
to fit more information on your screen. Select Large Fonts if you want
to improve the readability of text.\177
<P>
Make sure that your monitor supports the XGA configuration you select.
If it doesn't, you will be returned to the MS-DOS prompt when you try
to start Windows.
<P>
For more information on using Setup after you have installed Windows,
see Chapter 15, "Maintaining Windows with Setup," in the Microsoft
Windows User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>9.13  IBM XGA: Using EMM386</h3>
 
<P>
To use the IBM XGA successfully with the EMM386 expanded-memory
emulator, you need to manually prevent EMM386 from using the memory
address range used by the XGA display. To do this, include the X=
option on the device=EMM386.EXE line in your CONFIG.SYS file. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>   device=EMM386.EXE  X=C600-C7FF

</PRE></OL>Replace "C600-C7FF" with the correct value for the address range used
by your XGA. To identify this range, run the System Configuration
Program on the System Reference Disk for your Personal System/2
(PS/2), and select "Display Memory Map." A common range is C600-C7FF.
<P>
With some PS/2 model 75 plasma screens or with XGA configured for
640x480 resolution and 16 colors, you must also include the NOEMS or
RAM option on the device=EMM386.EXE line in your CONFIG.SYS file. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>   device=EMM386.EXE NOEMS X=C600-C7FF

</PRE>Do not include the i=B000-BE00 option on the device=EMM386.EXE line in
your CONFIG.SYS file. This address range is used by the XGA when
running Windows in 386 enhanced mode. Therefore, it cannot be used as
upper memory area. Windows will not recognize XGA configurations if
EMM386 is using this address range.
<P>
For more information about modifying your CONFIG.SYS file, see your
MS-DOS documentation. For more information about installing the EMM386
expanded-memory emulator and configuring the way it uses memory, see
Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows," in the Microsoft Windows User's
Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>9.14   Video Seven: VEGA Deluxe card</h3>
 
<P>
The VDDEGA.386 driver that Windows 3.1 supplies does not support the
Video Seven VEGA Deluxe card. If your computer has this video card and
the VDDEGA.386 driver is specified in the [386Enh] section of your
SYSTEM.INI file, your display may not be readable. To correct this
problem, you can do one of the following:
<P>
<PRE>   - Run Windows in standard mode only.
   - Contact Video Seven for a video display driver that supports the
     VEGA Deluxe card.
   - Replace the VEGA Deluxe card with a Windows-compatible card.

</PRE><h3>10.0  Using Specific Mice with Windows Version 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
This section describes some problems you may encounter using specific
types of mice with
Windows version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>10.1  Microsoft Mouse</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 3.1 includes version 8.20 of the Microsoft mouse drivers. If
you have a Microsoft mouse, Setup installs the Windows mouse driver
(MOUSE.DRV) in your Windows SYSTEM directory and an MS-DOS mouse
driver (MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS) in your Windows directory. If you have
additional versions of the Microsoft mouse drivers on your system,
make sure that you are using the mouse drivers provided with Windows
3.1.
<P>
If you use the Microsoft Mouse Control Panel version 8.0 or later, you
need to set your MS-DOS mouse variable to the directory on your hard
disk that contains the control-panel program files POINT.EXE and
PANEL.COM. You can do this by modifying your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For
example, if the control-panel program files are located in the \MOUSE
directory, you would add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
<PRE>   set mouse=c:\mouse

</PRE>This ensures that the mouse settings are stored in the MOUSE.INI file
located in the specified directory. If the mouse variable is not set
correctly, you may experience problems with mouse acceleration and
other mouse settings.
<P>
It is recommended that you use the mouse driver MOUSE.COM instead of
MOUSE.SYS, and that you load MOUSE.COM from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If
you use MOUSE.SYS, you may encounter problems saving MS-DOS mouse
control-panel settings. If you must use MOUSE.SYS and encounter
problems saving mouse settings, make sure you load it from your mouse
directory instead of from your Windows directory.
<P>
For more information about installing the mouse drivers, see Chapter
3, "Troubleshooting," in the Windows and MS-DOS Getting Started
manual.
<P>
<P><h3>10.2  Genius Mouse</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a Genius mouse and are running non-Windows
applications in 386 enhanced mode, the mouse may not work properly,
especially if you have several non-Windows applications running at the
same time.
<P>
To correct this problem, add the following line to the [386Enh]
section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   local=PC$MOUSE

</PRE>For more information about changing settings in the SYSTEM.INI file,
see the SYSINI.WRI online document.
<P>
<P><h3>10.3  Logitech Mouse</h3>
 
<P>
- Some Logitech mouse models are detected as "Microsoft or IBM PS/2"
mouse models by the Setup program. In this case, Setup will install
the mouse driver for the Microsoft or IBM PS/2 mouse. If you have a
Logitech mouse, you should use the Logitech mouse driver instead.
<P>
To install the Logitech mouse driver, run Windows Setup from the Main
group, and then select Logitech from the list of Mouse options. For
more information about using Setup after you have installed Windows,
see Chapter 15, "Maintaining Windows with Setup," in the Microsoft
Windows User's Guide.
<P>
- When installing the Logitech mouse driver, Windows Setup copies the
LMOUSE.COM file to your Windows directory. This is the mouse driver
that is required in order to use the Logitech mouse with non-Windows
applications. To use your mouse with non-Windows applications, you
need to load LMOUSE.COM before you start Windows. You can do this by
adding it to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. You will also need to add the
following line to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   local=PC$MOUSE

</PRE><h3>10.4  Logitech Cordless Mouse</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a Logitech Cordless mouse and you run Windows in 386
enhanced mode, you may encounter problems, such as an unresponsive
pointer, when running MS-DOS Prompt or non-Windows applications in a
window. To correct this problem, you need to do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Change the baud-rate setting for the mouse driver. To do this, add
   the following line to the [LogiMouse] section of the SYSTEM.INI
   file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      BaudRate=1200
</PRE>
<P><LI>Include the 1200 option in the command line that loads the MS-DOS
   Logitech mouse driver (which is provided with Windows 3.1) as
   follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      LMOUSE 1200
</PRE><P>
</OL>Add the above line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to load the mouse driver
each time you start your system. The next time you start Windows, your
mouse should work correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>10.5  Logitech or Microsoft Ballpoint Mouse on a Toshiba T2200SX</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a Toshiba T2200SX computer with a BIOS version
earlier than 1.20 and you have a Logitech or Microsoft ballpoint mouse
connected to the PS/2 mouse port, you may have problems moving the
mouse pointer. If the mouse does not respond, try connecting your
mouse to the serial port instead, or contact Toshiba for an upgraded
version of the BIOS.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>10.6  Mouse Systems Mouse on PS/2 Ports</h3>
 
<P>
The "Mouse Systems" serial and bus mouse drivers provided with Windows
do not support a Mouse Systems mouse when it is connected to a PS/2
style mouse port. If you are using a Mouse Systems mouse connected to
a PS/2 style mouse port, Setup installs the "Microsoft or IBM PS/2"
mouse driver for you. This is the correct driver. Do not change it.
<P>
<P><h3>10.7  Mouse Systems optical mouse</h3>
 
<P>
Setup does not detect "Mouse Systems" optical mouse. However, the
optical mouse is compatible with Windows 3.1. To use the "Mouse
Systems" optical mouse, you need to install its driver with
Windows Setup. For instructions, see "Installing a Device Driver Not
Supplied with Windows Version 3.1" in Chapter 15, "Maintaining Windows
with Setup," in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
<P>
<P><h3>11.0  Using Additional Hardware Configurations with Windows 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
This section contains information about using Windows version 3.1 with
different types of computers and hardware configurations.
<P>
<P><h3>11.1  CD-ROM Drives</h3>
 
<P>
- If you are using a CD-ROM drive with Windows 3.1, you should use
version 2.21 of Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) with all
configurations of CD-ROM drives. If you use version 2.20 or later, you
must also remove the following setting from the [386Enh] section of
the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>     device=LANMAN10.386

</PRE></OL>This setting can cause some CD-ROM drives to timeout and fail with
versions later than 2.20 of MSCDEX. However, if you must use a version
earlier than 2.20 of MSCDEX, the above setting is required in the
[386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
- If a CD-ROM drive causes instability in your system or causes your
system to fail, you may need to update the CD-ROM driver. Also, the
MCI (Media Control Interface) driver MCICDA.DRV may not work properly
with older CD-ROM drivers. Contact your CD-ROM-drive manufacturer
about obtaining an updated driver.
<P>
<P><h3>11.2  EISA Systems with More Than 16 Megabytes of Extended Memory</h3>
 
<P>
On some EISA (extended industry standard architecture) computers,
there may be more extended memory available than the system's Int
15h/88h BIOS call can detect. On these computers, HIMEM.SYS uses only
the amount of extended memory detected. This can result in a large
amount of unused memory.
<P>
You can have HIMEM.SYS use all available extended memory by using the
/EISA option in the CONFIG.SYS file. For example, if HIMEM.SYS is
located in your WINDOWS directory, you would use the following command
line in the CONFIG.SYS file to take advantage of all available
extended memory:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\windows\himem.sys /EISA

</PRE>If you use the /EISA option, do not load any device drivers that use
the Int 15h/88h BIOS call to allocate extended memory before loading
HIMEM.SYS. If you do, your system may not work properly. If you must
reserve some extended memory for device drivers or applications that
use the Int 15h/88h BIOS call, you can specify the amount of memory in
kilobytes that you want reserve by using the /INT15= option. For
example, if you want to reserve 128 kilobytes of extended memory, you
would use the following command line in the CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\windows\himem.sys /EISA /INT15=128

</PRE>HIMEM.SYS must still be loaded before other device drivers in the
CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
To determine if your device driver or application use the Int15h/88h
BIOS call, see the
documentation for your device or contact your device dealer. For more
information about using
HIMEM.SYS with the INT15 option, see Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows,"
in the Microsoft
Windows User's Guide.
<P>
<P>
11.3  Epson Screen Savers
<P>
Some Epson computers have screen-saver utilities that clear the screen
after a specified period of
inactivity. With Windows version 3.1, the screen saver might detect
that the system is idle when it
is not. Windows will function properly even though the screen is
blank, but nothing will be
displayed until you quit Windows and then restart it.
<P>
See the documentation that you received with your Epson computer for
instructions on how to turn

<P>
<P><h3>11.4  Everex 386/25 with EMM386.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using an Everex 386/25 with EMM386.EXE, include the
following options on the device=emm386.exe command line in your
CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
<PRE>   device=EMM386.EXE X=C600-C7FF

</PRE><h3>11.5  NCR 925 with EMM386.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using an NCR 925 with EMM386.EXE, include the following
option on the device=emm386.exe command line in your CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
<PRE>   device=EMM386.EXE X=E000-EFFF

</PRE><h2>11.6  Non-US Keyboard Layouts: Using Application Shortcut Keys</h2>
 
<P>
Some non-US keyboards show two characters per alphabet key and three
characters per alphanumeric key. To type the second or third
character, you must press and hold down CTRL+ALT or ALTGR before
pressing the key. If you are using such a keyboard layout, do not use
keys that show two or three characters as application shortcut keys.
<P>
<P><h3>11.7  Plus Hardcard</h3>
 
<P>
- To run Windows version 3.1 with a Hardcard, you must include the
following line in the [386Enh] section in the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   VirtualHDIRQ=Off

</PRE>For information on how to modify the SYSTEM.INI file, see the
SYSINI.WRI online document.
<P>
Note:  This procedure is not necessary if you are using a Hardcard II
or a Hardcard II XL.
<P>
- It is also recommended that you use SMARTDrive with a Hardcard. For
more information about using SMARTDrive, see Chapter 14, "Optimizing
Windows," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>11.8  SCSI Hard Disk Using DMA</h3>
 
<P>
If your computer has a SCSI hard disk that uses Direct Memory Access
(DMA), you must include the following entry in the [386Enh] section of
the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   VirtualHDIRQ=Off

</PRE>In addition, you must have SMARTDrive installed and you must NOT
disable double-buffering by removing or remarking out the \D option in
the CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
<P><h3>11.9 Columbia Data Products SCSI Hard-Disk Controller</h3>
 
<P>
To use the Columbia Data Products SCSI hard-disk controller with
Windows version 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode, you must update the Columbia
Data Products SCSI driver to version 3.35 or higher.
<P>
<P><h3>11.10 Serial Ports on 80286-Based Computers: Improving Performance</h3>
 
<P>
If the baud rate-setting for your COM ports is 9600 or higher and you
are experiencing slow COM performance or are losing characters when
sending or receiving information using a communications application in
standard mode, try the following solutions to correct the problem.
Try solution one first. If that doesn't work, then try solution two,
and so on:

<OL><P><LI>Reduce the number of MS-DOS drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident
   programs (TSRs) loaded from your CONFIG.SYS file.

<P><LI>Add the following line to the [standard] section of the SYSTEM.INI
   file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      FasterModeSwitch=1
</PRE><P>
</OL>Note: The FasterModeSwitch setting may not work on older systems or
systems that are incompatible with Windows version 3.1. In this case,
Windows may fail when you start it.

<OL><P><LI>  Do not load MS-DOS 5.0 into upper memory (do not include the
</OL>command line dos=high in your CONFIG.SYS file).
<P>
<P><h3>11.11  Sound Blaster Audio Card</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a Sound Blaster audio card that includes a Digital
Signal Processor (DSP) chip earlier than version 2.0, you may want to
upgrade to version 2.0 to improve audio performance. To find out which
version of the DSP chip you currently have, run the TEST-SBC.EXE
utility included in your Sound Blaster package. To receive version 2.0
of the DSP chip, contact Creative Labs, Inc.
<P>
<P><h3>11.12  Tandy 2500 XL with MS-DOS in ROM</h3>
 
<P>
The Tandy 2500 XL can be configured to use MS-DOS in read-only memory
(ROM). If you want to use this feature, after you run Windows Setup
you must run the Tandy setup program (SETUPXL). Modify your
configuration so that your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files are read
from drive C.
<P>
<P><h3>11.13  Wyse Computers</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using a Wyse computer to run Windows, you might need to
modify the device=HIMEM.SYS line in your CONFIG.SYS file to read:
<P>
<PRE>   device=[path]HIMEM.SYS  /M:WYSE

</PRE></OL><h3>11.14  Memory Chips: Parity Errors</h3>
 
<P>
If you are receiving parity errors while running Windows 3.1, you
probably have a bad memory chip, even if you didn't have parity errors
while running Windows 3.0. (Windows 3.0 did not detect parity errors.)
<P>
If you run a memory test utility and it reports that the memory is
fine, you should still have your machine tested. Memory tests, in
general, do not do a good job of detecting parity errors. For
assistance in testing your computer for a bad memory chip, contact
your hardware vendor.
<P>
Some hardware can cause Windows to erroneously generate a parity
error. Windows will display a parity error if the hardware on the
machine generates a nonmaskable interrupt (NMI). Windows will only
display a parity error when a true parity error occurs or when a
system component such as an older autoswitching EGA card can generate
a NMI. It is possible for a card such as this to cause a false parity
error. This only happens when changing video modes.
<P>
For example, if you get a parity error every time you start MS-DOS
Prompt in full-screen mode (the video mode will change from graphics
to text mode), the video card is probably causing an NMI, which causes
Windows 3.1 to display a parity error.
<P>
