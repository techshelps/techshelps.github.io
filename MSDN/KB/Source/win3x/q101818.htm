<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>LAYOUTS.WRI Lists Wrong Size for MONOUMB2.386</h3>
 
<P>
The LAYOUTS.WRI file included with the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit
(WRK) for version 3.1 incorrectly lists the expanded size for
MONOUMB2.386. The listed size is 46161 bytes.
<P>
The actual size of the expanded MONOUMB2.386 file is 4745 bytes.
<P>
<P><h3>LAYOUTS.WRI Lists Wrong Size for UNIDRV.DLL</h3>
 
<P>
The LAYOUTS.WRI file included with the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit
(WRK) for version 3.1 incorrectly lists the expanded file size for
UNIDRV.DLL. The listed size is 119008 bytes.
<P>
The actual size of the UNIDRV.DLL file included with the original WRK
is 119296 bytes, and the file date is 3/10/92.
<P>
NOTE: The UNIDRV.DLL file is occasionally updated and the file size
and date may change.
<P>
For more information about this driver, query the following in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   unidrv.dll and windows and update

</PRE><h3>PRINTERS.WRI Incorrectly References Minoutlineppem</h3>
 
<P>
Section 4.5 of the PRINTERS.WRI file included with Microsoft Windows
3.1 and with the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit for version 3.1
incorrectly spells the WIN.INI PostScript setting  "minoutlineppem."
<P>
Section 4.5, "Controlling TrueType Font Downloading on PostScript
Printers," references the following WIN.INI setting:
<P>
<PRE>   minoutlineeppem=&lt;number&gt;

</PRE>This is spelled incorrectly. It should be spelled as follows
<P>
<PRE>   minoutlineppem=&lt;number&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;number&gt; refers to points per em space (an em space is a unit of
measurement where the width of the space is about as wide as it is
tall).
<P>
Using the incorrect spelling results in Windows using the default
value of 101 points per em space.
<P>
NOTE: If you change the minoutlineppem setting, you must exit and
restart Windows for the changes to take effect.
<P>
Additional information on the minoutlineppem setting can be found by
querying on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   postscript and minoutlineppem and win.ini

</PRE><h3>Page 12 Incorrectly States T3100/20 Laptop Requires Updated BIOS</h3>
 
<P>
Page 12 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for Windows
3.1 incorrectly states that BIOS version 4.2 or later is necessary for
the T3100/20 laptop computer to run Windows.
<P>
The T3100/20 works with Windows 3.0 with a BIOS of 2.01, provided
CGA is selected as the display.
<P>
For more information about this model, query on the following keywords:
<P>
<PRE>   toshiba and bios and t3100

</PRE><h3>Page 12 Incorrectly States Which Phoenix ROM BIOS Needs Update</h3>
 
<P>
Chart 1.4 on page 12 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK)
guide for Windows 3.1 states:
<P>
<PRE>   According to Phoenix, any BIOS dated earlier than 1988 should be
   upgraded. There are several OEM versions of Phoenix BIOS that
   cause problems. Contact the computer manufacturer for more
   information.

</PRE>The information above should state:
<P>
<PRE>   ...any BIOS dated 1988 and earlier should be upgraded.

</PRE><h3>Page 12 Incorrectly States Information Regarding AMI BIOS</h3>
 
<P>
Page 12, chart 1.4, incorrectly states the following in the AMI BIOS box:
<P>
<PRE>   1989 - Causes intermittent UAEs and system hangs.

   1991 - Serial port problems. Most often seen as mouse and modem
   problems.

</PRE>The 1989 BIOS description should read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   1989 - On a computer with an IDE hard disk, you may experience
   intermittent unrecoverable application errors (UAEs) or general
   protection (GP) faults, and the system consequently hangs.

</PRE>The 1991 BIOS description should not be included because AMI has confirmed
that this information is erroneous.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 17 Flowchart Incorrectly States SMARTDrive Cache Parameter</h3>
 
<P>
Page 17, chart 1.8, of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK)
guide for Windows 3.1 states the following in the fifth flowchart
step:
<P>
<PRE>   Note: The SMARTDrive command line can be edited to allow caching
   of "stacked" volumes by adding a +&lt;drive&gt; (where &lt;drive&gt; is a
   "stacked" volume). If caching...

</PRE>The +&lt;drive&gt; parameter is incorrect. The correct command line syntax
to turn on the SMARTDrive disk cache is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE &lt;drive&gt;+

</PRE>SMARTDrive automatically detects the existence of Stacker and caches
the underlying Stacker drive. SMARTDrive should not be used to cache a
Stacker volume. Typing "smartdrv /?" (without the quotation marks) at
the MS-DOS command prompt lists the command line parameters for
SMARTDrive with their meanings.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 21 Flowchart Incorrectly Uses LANMAN10.DOS for LANMAN10.386</h3>
 
<P>
The flowchart on page 21 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK)
guide for Windows 3.1 incorrectly uses the term LANMAN10.DOS where
LANMAN10.386 is intended.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 23 IRQ Line in SYSTEM.INI Referenced Incorrectly</h3>
 
<P>
In Flowchart 2.5 B on page 23 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit"
(WRK) guide for Windows 3.1, the following line is incorrect:
<P>
<PRE>   Leave the IRQ9=Global line in the SYSTEM.INI.

</PRE>The line should read:
<P>
<PRE>   Leave the IRQ9Global=Yes line in the SYSTEM.INI file.

</PRE><h3>Page 30 Flowchart Shows Incorrect Directory for TESTPS.TXT</h3>
 
<P>
The "Cannot Print on Stand-Alone PC" flowchart (4.1) on page 30 of the
"Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for Windows 3.1 suggests
that you copy the TESTPS.TXT file from the Windows directory to the
PostScript printer if you have a PostScript printer.
<P>
The TESTPS.TXT file is located in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory, not
the Windows directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 78 Incorrectly States .SHH File Prompts for Directory</h3>
 
<P>
Page 78 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" guide for Windows 3.1
states that if the [windir] section of the SETUP.SHH file is left
blank, Windows Setup prompts you for a directory. This information is
incorrect.
<P>
If the directory is not specified in the [windir] section, the dialog
box never appears, and Windows installs to the default directory
WINDOWS.
<P>
The system settings template file, SETUP.SHH, that comes with Windows
is used to create a custom system settings file. This file is used in
conjunction with the SETUP /H:&lt;filespec&gt; option (where &lt;filespec&gt; is
SETUP.SHH with its fully qualified path if SETUP.SHH does not exist in
the Windows directory). The [windir] section is used to specify the
directory where the user files are installed.
<P>
To work around this situation:

<OL><P><LI>Add the line "C:\* " (without the quotation marks) to the [windir]
   section of SETUP.SHH:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [windir]
      C:\*
</PRE><P>
   C:\* is an invalid directory, and this entry forces Setup to
   prompt you for a valid directory.

<P><LI>Run Setup. Setup displays a red warning box that states that an
   error has occurred and asks you to press ENTER to continue or press
   F3 to exit.

<P><LI>Press ENTER. The next screen prompts you for the correct directory.

<P><LI>Type the name of the directory where you want to install the
   Windows user files and press ENTER.
<P>
</OL><h3>Page 131 Incorrectly States SETUP /N Creates Directories</h3>
 
<P>
When you initiate a network setup (using the SETUP /N command) for
Windows 3.1, you should be able to create directories and copy files
to them by modifying the SETUP.INF file.
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for Windows 3.1
documents this procedure on page 131; however, this procedure does not
create the directory.
<P>
If you follow the example listed in the WRK guide, SETUP /N should
create the APPDIR directory within the Windows user directory and copy
the files in the [custom.apps] section. However, this directory is
never created and Setup copies the files to the Windows user directory
before completing the installation.
<P>
To create the APPDIR directory, use the MS-DOS MD (MAKE DIRECTORY)
command.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 143 Incorrectly Lists Sound Blaster Driver Versions</h3>
 
<P>
Page 143 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for
Windows 3.1 incorrectly states the association of Sound Blaster
drivers and versions as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   SNDBLST.DRV=SoundBlaster 1.5 DSP driver
   SNDBLST2.DRV=SoundBlaster 2.0 DSP driver

</PRE></OL>The correct associations are:
<P>
<PRE>   SNDBLST.DRV=SoundBlaster 1.0 DSP driver (for a Sound Blaster
   version 1.0 card or a version 1.5 card with an old DSP 1.05 chip)

   SNDBLST2.DRV=SoundBlaster 1.5 DSP driver (for a Sound Blaster
   version 1.5 card with a DSP 2.0 chip, or a version 2.0 card [this
   is the Sound Blaster Pro])

</PRE>With the Sound Blaster Pro card (these have DSP versions 3.x), you can
use SNDBLST2.DRV; however, Windows may display a warning message when
setting the port and IRQ, indicating that new drivers are needed from
the manufacturer.
<P>
These drivers are available from Creative Labs Technical Support.
<P>
For more information, query on the following words:
<P>
<PRE>   dsp and specific and soundblaster

</PRE><h3>Page 172 Incorrectly Lists iNegCurr= Value</h3>
 
<P>
Page 172 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for
Windows 3.1 lists an incorrect value for the iNegCurr= entry in the
[intl] section of the WIN.INI file. The Windows Resource Kit (WRK)
lists both "($1)" and "$ 1-" as having the iNegCurr value of 0. The
value for "$ 1-" is incorrect. The correct value for "$ 1-" is 10.
<P>
The [intl] section of the WIN.INI file describes how to display dates,
times, currency amounts, and other items for countries around the
world. The default values reflect U.S. options.
<P>
The iNegCurr entry indicates the format to use for negative values for
currency. This entry can be changed by choosing the International icon
from Control Panel, and using the Currency Format option.
<P>
Valid entries for the iNegCurr= entry are:
<P>
<PRE>   Value    Format
   ---------------

   0        ($1)
   1        -$1
   2        $-1
   3        $1-
   4        (1$)
   5        -1$
   6        1-$
   7        1$-
   8        -1 $
   9        -$ 1
   10        $ 1-

</PRE>For example, the entry iNegCurr=5 would cause a negative currency
value to be displayed in the format "-1$."
<P>
Page 176 Incorrectly Documents TTIfCollisions=
 
<P>
Page 176 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for
Windows 3.1 incorrectly documents the TTIfCollisions= entry of the
[TRUETYPE] section of the WIN.INI file. The same error occurs in the
WININI.WRI file.
<P>
Both page 176 and WININI.WRI state the following about the
TTIfCollisions= entry in the WIN.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   If you set this value to 0, Windows will use the TrueType version.

</PRE>The correct statement should be:
<P>
<PRE>   If you set this value to 1, Windows will use the TrueType version.

</PRE>The TTIfCollisions= entry specifies whether to use TrueType fonts in
place of other fonts if both types of fonts are installed on the system
and have the same font name.
<P>
<P><h3>Page 196 Incorrectly Indicates COMxFIFO is Boolean Aware</h3>
 
<P>
Page 196 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for
Windows 3.1 incorrectly identifies On/Off as functioning with the
COMxFIFO switch. The SYSINI.WRI file included with the WRK also
incorrectly identifies TRUE/FALSE as functioning with this switch.
<P>
The SYSTEM.INI's [386Enh] setting COMxFIFO= is not fully Boolean
aware. It can be set to either 0 for off or 1 for on, but does not
correctly understand True/False, On/Off, Yes/No.
<P>
COMxFIFO=1 and COMxFIFO=0 are the usable switches (where "x" is the
communications port).
<P>
For more information about this setting, query on:
<P>
<PRE>   commq&amp;a and windows 3.1

</PRE><h3>Page 196 Incorrectly Documents COMMdrv30= as COMdrv30=</h3>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for Windows 3.1
incorrectly documents the SYSTEM.INI [386Enh] switch for using the
Windows 3.0 communications driver on page 196. The WRK incorrectly
spells the switch as COMdrv30=. The correct spelling of this switch is
COMMdrv30=.
<P>
This error also exists in the WRK's version of the SYSINI.WRI dated
4/6/92.
<P>
COMMdrv30=&lt;Boolean&gt;
<P>
This switch should be set for Yes or True, if you are:

<UL><LI>Using the COMM.DRV driver that came with Windows 3.0
<P>
  -or-

<LI>Using a third-party driver compatible with the Windows 3.0
   communication driver, but not with Windows 3.1's driver. When set
   to True or Yes, the Virtual COM Driver (VCD) will use its own copy
   of the serial communications driver's interrupt handler. By
   default, this line does not exist, which is the same as saying
   COMMdrv30=False or No.
