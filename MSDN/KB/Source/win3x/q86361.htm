</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was taken from the Windows &amp; MS-DOS 5
Upgrade NETWORKS.TXT file. This article contains sections 7 through
17.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>    Artisoft LANtastic
<P>
</OL>7.1.   MS-DOS Procedure
<P>
Before you run Setup with any version of Artisoft LANtastic,
make sure to shut down the LANtastic server. Do not shut down
the workstation client.
<P>
7.1.1. Artisoft LANtastic Versions 3.01 or Earlier
<P>
Artisoft LANtastic versions 3.02 and higher are compatible
with MS-DOS 5.0
<P>
If you are using LANtastic versions 2.5 through 3.01,
you need to type two SETVER commands at the command prompt.
The SETVER command reports to your network software the
version of DOS that it was designed to run with--in this
case, version 4.0.
<P>
If you are using a LANtastic version earlier than 2.5,
contact your network vendor for an update.
<P>
To update LANtastic versions 3.01 or earlier:

<OL><P><LI>Shut down the LANtastic server. Do not shut down the
   workstation client.

<P><LI>Set up MS-DOS 5.0 on your computer. For more information
   about installing MS-DOS 5.0, see "Getting Started."
<P>
   MS-DOS may display two "Incorrect DOS version" messages
   when your network restarts. Ignore these.

<P><LI>Type the following commands at the command prompt:
<P>
   setver redir.exe 4.00
<P>
   setver server.exe 4.00

<P><LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
</OL>If you are using EMM386, you might need to exclude the
memory area used by the network adapter card. To do this,
use the x switch with the DEVICE command for EMM386.EXE in
your CONFIG.SYS file. If you are using the factory-set
defaults for the LANtastic 2Mbps adapter, include the x=d800-
dfff switch with the DEVICE command for EMM386.EXE. If this
memory region is not excluded, you might experience problems
with programs that use expanded memory.
<P>
For more information about EMM386 options, see Chapter 15 of
the "Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."
<P>
<P>
7.2. Windows Procedure
<P>
LANtastic versions below 3.0 are not compatible with
Microsoft Windows.
<P>
For information about LANtastic versions 3.x or 4.x, see the
specific sections that follow. The following notes apply to
both versions.
<P>
o The EMMExclude setting, added to the SYSTEM.INI file
<PRE>  during Setup, is required for the default configuration of
  the Artisoft LANtastic Enhanced 2mbps network adapter. If
  you have changed the memory address setting on your
  adapter, modify this entry in SYSTEM.INI to reflect the
  appropriate address range. If you are not using this
  network adapter, you can remove this entry.

</PRE></OL>o Some commands require the NetHeapSize entry in the
<PRE>  SYSTEM.INI file to be set higher than the default value;
  for example, XCOPY requires NetHeapSize=128. Increasing
  the NetHeapSize value leaves less memory available for non-
  Windows applications, so only increase this value if
  necessary. For more information about the NetHeapSize
  entry, see the SYSINI.WRI file.

</PRE>o You cannot create a permanent swapfile while running
<PRE>  Windows on a LANtastic server. To create a permanent
  swapfile, restart your computer without loading the server
  software, and create the swapfile in Windows. If a dialog
  box appears asking you to restart Windows, you must
  restart Windows in 386 enhanced mode before you start the
  server software.

</PRE>o If you are running a LANtastic server, you cannot use
<PRE>  Windows File Manager to format a floppy disk. You can use
  the FORMAT command at the MS-DOS prompt instead.


</PRE>7.2.1. Artisoft LANtastic 3.x
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with LANtastic 3.x, the
following entries are added to the [386Enh] section of
SYSTEM.INI:
<P>
EMMExclude=D800-DFFF
INDOSPolling=TRUE
NetHeapSize=76
NetAsynchFallback=TRUE
NetAsynchTimeout=50
<P>
In addition:
<P>
To print from any mode of Windows across LANtastic 3.x, it
is necessary to do one of the following:
<P>
o Turn off the Fast Printing Direct To Port option in
<PRE>  Control Panel. To do this, choose the Printers option in
  Control Panel, and then choose the Connect button. In the
  Connect dialog box, clear the Fast Printing Direct To Port
  check box.

</PRE>When you turn off this option, it affects all of your ports.
<P>
If you want to turn this option off for one port only,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>If you are printing using LPT3, add the following
   entry to the [ports] section of the WIN.INI file:
<P>
   LPT3.DOS=
<P>
   If you are using LPT1 or LPT2, you can use the LPT1.DOS or
   LPT2.DOS entries already in your WIN.INI file.

<P><LI>Quit Windows, and then redirect the LPTx port
   (where x is the port you are using) by using the LANtastic
   NET USE command.

<P><LI>Restart Windows.

<P><LI>Using Control Panel, change your printer port to
   LPTx.DOS.
<P>
<P>
</OL>o If you are running LANtastic version 3.x, you cannot run
<PRE>  Windows in 386 enhanced mode on a non-dedicated server.

</PRE></OL>o If you have a network connection on LPT1, it will not be
<PRE>  displayed in Print Manager or Control Panel.

</PRE>7.2.2. Artisoft LANtastic 4.x
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with LANtastic 4.x, the
following entries are added to the [386Enh] section of
SYSTEM.INI:
<P>
EMMExclude=D800-DFFF
NetAsynchFallback=TRUE
NetAsynchTimeout=50
NetHeapSize=64
PerVMFiles=0
<P>
In addition:
<P>
o If you set up Windows for use with LANtastic 4.x, you must
<PRE>  have the LANTASTI.386 file somewhere on your path. This
  file should be located in your LANtastic directory. If
  LANTASTI.386 is not in your path, the Windows part of
  Setup adds *dosnet to the [386Enh] section of the
  SYSTEM.INI file. To use Windows with LANtastic 4.x, remove
  this entry and add the entries shown above, and make sure
  LANTASTI.386 is somewhere on your path.


</PRE><P><LI>    Microsoft MS-Net and 100-Percent Compatible Networks
<P>
</OL>8.1.   MS-DOS Procedure
<P>
8.1.1. General Instructions
<P>
Follow the instructions in this section if you are using one
of the following networks:
<P>
o Microsoft MS-Net, all versions
<P>
o Hewlett-Packard Office Works, all versions
<P>
o NCR PC LAN, all versions
<P>
o Olivetti Olinet-LAN, version 1.23 or earlier
<P>
o Ungermann-Bass Net/One PC, versions 2.0 through 2.1
<P>
Note: If you are using 3Com 3+Share Version 1.6 or
<PRE>      earlier, see the separate section for this network
      below.

</PRE></OL>To update MS-NET or 100-percent compatible networks, replace
your current REDIR.EXE and SETNAME.EXE files with the new
versions included with the Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0
Upgrade. It's a good idea to preserve your current files by
renaming them with a different extension, such as .OLD or
.BAK.
<P>
To update MS-NET or a 100-percent compatible network:

<OL><P><LI>Rename the following files:
<P>
   REDIR.EXE (usually in the directory that contains your
   network files)
   SETNAME.EXE (usually in the directory that contains your
   network files)

<P><LI>Copy the EXPAND.EXE file on Setup disk 1 to the DOS directory
   on the hard drive.

<P><LI>Open the PACKING.LST file on Setup disk 1 to determine the
   location of the REDIR.2X_ file.

<P><LI>Use the following syntax to expand and copy the new
   files to your network directory:
<P>
   expand [drive1:]redir.2x_ [drive2:][path]redir.exe
   expand [drive1:]setname.ex_ [drive2:][path]setname.exe
<P>
   The [drive1:] parameter specifies the location of the
   compressed file you want to expand. The [drive2:][path]
   parameter specifies the destination for the expanded file.
<P>
   For example, if the REDIR.2X_ file is on a disk in drive A,
   and your REDIR.EXE file is in the NETWORK directory on drive C,
   type this at the command prompt:
<P>
   expand a:\redir.2x_ c:\network\redir.exe

<P><LI>Review your MSNET.INI file to make sure the REDIR command appears
   before the SETNAME command when both appear in the same command
   set.
<P>
   For example, suppose one of your command sets in MSNET.INI appears
   as follows:
<P>
   start rdr $1
   chknet
   loadniu -r -d -m:d -i:5 exniuw.xfm stdlc
   xnsbios -m:d -i:5
   session
   setname $1
   redir /l:26 /s:9
   prtsc
<P>
   You would reverse the order of the SETNAME and REDIR commands
   so the command set appears as follows:
<P>
   start rdr $1
   chknet
   loadniu -r -d -m:d -i:5 exniuw.xfm stdlc
   xnsbios -m:d -i:5
   session
   redir /l:26 /s:9
   setname $1
   prtsc
<P>
</OL>Note: If Ungermann-Bass Net/One PC does not load with MS-
<PRE>      DOS 5.0, do one of the following:
      o Contact your vendor to get an updated LOADNIU.EXE
        file.
      o Put an UBPAUSE command between the LOADNIU and
        XNSBIOS lines of the MSNET.INI file.
      o Issue network commands from a batch file that
        includes a PAUSE command between the LOADNIU and
        XNSBIOS lines.


</PRE></OL>After you complete the procedure, set up MS-DOS 5.0 on your
computer. For information about installing MS-DOS, see
"Getting Started."
<P>
8.1.2. 3Com 3+Share Version 1.6 or Earlier
<P>
To update 3Com 3+Share version 1.6, replace your current
MSREDIR.EXE file with the new version included with the
Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0 Upgrade. It's a good idea to
preserve your current file by renaming it with a different
extension, such as .OLD or .BAK.
<P>
If you have a 3+Share version earlier than 1.6, contact your
network vendor for an update. You cannot run a server with
3+ Share version 1.6 or earlier and MS-DOS 5.0.
<P>
Note: Version 1.6 or earlier of 3+Start, the remote-
<PRE>      startup software from 3Com, is not compatible with MS-
      DOS version 4.x or 5.0.

</PRE>To update 3Com 3+Share version 1.6:

<OL><P><LI>Rename the following file:
<P>
   MSREDIR.EXE (usually in C:\3SHARE)

<P><LI>Copy the EXPAND.EXE file on Setup disk 1 to the DOS directory
   on the hard drive.

<P><LI>Open the PACKING.LST file on Setup disk 1 to determine the
   the location of the REDIR.2X_ file.

<P><LI>Use the following syntax to expand and copy the new file
   to your network directory:
<P>
   expand [drive1:]redir.2x_ [drive2:][path]msredir.exe
<P>
   The [drive1:] parameter specifies the location of the
   compressed file you want to expand. The [drive2:][path]
   parameter specifies the destination for the expanded file.
<P>
   For example, if the REDIR.2X_ file is on a disk in drive
   A, and your MSREDIR.EXE file is in the 3SHARE directory on
   drive C, type this at the command prompt:
<P>
   expand a:\redir.2x_ c:\3share\msredir.exe
<P>
</OL>After you complete the procedure, set up MS-DOS 5.0 on your
computer. For more information about installing MS-DOS 5.0,
see "Getting Started."
<P>
8.2.   Windows Procedure
<P>
8.2.1. General Instructions
<P>
If a network is present and detected, but cannot be
identified during the Windows part of Setup, the Microsoft
Network is the default network that may be set up. The
following notes apply to the general category of networks
that support the MS-DOS network interface and NetBIOS
protocols.
<P>
For specific notes on Ungermann-Bass Net/One and 3Com
Networks, see these separate sections below.
<P>
When you set up Windows for use with Microsoft Network, the
following entries are added to the [386Enh] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
TimerCriticalSection=10000
UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
PSPIncrement=5
<P>
For some networks, you may be able to remove one or more of
these entries to improve performance. For more information
about these entries, see the SYSINI.WRI file.
<P>
In addition:
<P>
o If the path to your network software is not included in
<PRE>  the path in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, Setup does not detect
  a network and proposes "No Network Installed" for your
  system configuration. Use Custom Setup to specify that the
  Microsoft Network is installed.

</PRE></OL>o Due to the way some networks handle print queues, Print
<PRE>  Manager cannot distinguish multiple print queues on the
  same server. The lists of print jobs in these queues might
  be displayed improperly. In addition, Print Manager might
  not be able to display the job title when displaying queue
  information.

</PRE>o The Microsoft network driver does not support any vendor's
<PRE>  name-aliasing scheme.


</PRE>8.2.2. Ungermann-Bass Net/One
<P>
Ungermann-Bass Net/One is based on Microsoft Network.  Make
sure you choose the proper network option when you set up
Windows.
<P>
o Choose the Microsoft Network Or 100 Compatible option
<PRE>  when running the Windows and MS-DOS Setup program.

</PRE>o Ungermann-Bass Net/One LAN Manager is based on Microsoft
<PRE>  LAN Manager. See the Microsoft LAN Manager section earlier
  in this document for more information.

</PRE>In addition:
<P>
If you are using an Ungermann-Bass network card with any
network, including networks not produced by Ungermann-Bass,
your system may not run correctly in 386 enhanced mode
unless you have the proper settings in your SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
If you experience problems, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open your SYSTEM.INI file by using a text editor
   such as Notepad. SYSTEM.INI is located in your Windows
   directory.

<P><LI>Find or add the [386Enh] section in the file.
<P>
   If you're using Notepad, you can find this section by
   choosing Find from the Search menu, typing [386Enh], and
   then choosing the OK button.

<P><LI>Find or add the TimerCriticalSection=10000 line
   in this section.

<P><LI>Save your SYSTEM.INI file.

<P><LI>Quit and restart Windows.
<P>
</OL>o If you are using an Ungermann-Bass XNS transport stack,
<PRE>  you must make sure it is configured not to use expanded
  memory when running Windows version 3.1 in 386 enhanced
  mode.

</PRE></OL>8.2.3. 3Com Networks
<P>
The Windows part of Setup recognizes the following 3Com
networks:
<P>
o The 3Com 3+Share network is based on the Microsoft Network
<PRE>  product and will be handled as such by Windows. See the
  "Microsoft Network and Compatibles" section later in this
  document.

</PRE>o The 3Com 3+Open LAN Manager network is based on Microsoft
<PRE>  LAN Manager and will be handled as such by Windows. See
  the "Microsoft LAN Manager Networks" section earlier in
  this document.

</PRE>When you install for 3Com 3+Share or 3Com 3+Open LAN
Manager, Setup adds the following entries to the [386Enh]
section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
TimerCriticalSection=10000
UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
PSPIncrement=5
<P>
See SYSINI.WRI for more information on these entries.
<P>
In addition:
<P>
o Some copies of 3Com 3+Open LAN Manager version 1.1 require
<PRE>  a maintenance upgrade to work with Windows. If you
  encounter problems, contact your network customer-support
  organization.

</PRE>o When you install Windows, Setup modifies your AUTOEXEC.BAT
<PRE>  file to make sure the Windows directory appears in your
  path ahead of any conflicting directories. However,  the
  3+Share network might change this path when you log in. If
  so, your system administrator must modify the network log-
  in procedure so that the path is set correctly to run
  Windows.

</PRE>o On a 3Com 3+Open network, the user's name displayed by
<PRE>  Windows Print Manager might not match the user's actual
  log-in name.

</PRE>o Some 3Com 3Station diskless workstations come with an All
<PRE>  ChargeCard. Make sure your machine is not configured to
  load the network into the upper memory area between 640K
  and 1 megabyte, as this will not work reliably with
  Windows version 3.1 in standard mode. You will not be able
  to set up Windows if your system is configured in this
  way.

</PRE>o If you use the 3C505 Network Adapter Card, you must
<PRE>  disable the Link Plus Optimizer to run Windows in 386
  enhanced mode. You can disable it by removing the
  following lines from your CONFIG.SYS file:

  device=psh.sys arguments
  device=pth.sys

  In addition, remove the following line from your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT (or any other batch file you use to start
  your network):

  ldr

</PRE>o Windows does not support the 3Com network aliasing scheme
<PRE>  (three-part names).

10.2.   Windows Procedure

</PRE></OL>10.2.1. IBM PC LAN Program
<P>
The IBM PC LAN Program is based on the Microsoft Network
product and will be handled as such by Windows.
<P>
When setting up Windows for use with the IBM PC LAN Program,
the following entry is added to the [386Enh] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
INDOSpolling=TRUE
<P>
See the online document, SYSINI.WRI, for more information on
this setting.
<P>
In addition:
<P>
o When you connect to a network share by using File Manager,
<PRE>  that redirection will not be detected by non-Windows
  applications.

</PRE>o The IBM PCLP Extended Services refers to network drives
<PRE>  and printers by two different names. Usually, when
  connecting to a network, you select connections from a
  list containing descriptive names, but internally
  connections are made using hidden names such as
  \\SERVER\IBMXS001.

  With PCLP Extended Services, you must type the same name
  as the hidden names in Control Panel or File Manager to
  make new network connections. Consult your network
  administrator to learn the proper names to use.

</PRE>o Some versions of PCLP lock up your system if you receive a
<PRE>  broadcast message while running Windows. You can disable
  these messages with the net pause messenger command. Or
  you can start up your network with NET START RDR instead
  of NET START RCV or NET START MSG commands.

</PRE>o When you connect to a network printer by using Control
<PRE>  Panel, the connection will not be detected by non-Windows
  applications. It will, however, still be usable by Windows
  and Windows applications.

</PRE>o If you use "setup /a" to copy and expand Windows files
<PRE>  to the network, then use "setup /n" to set up Windows
  over the network, make sure the NET.COM file appears in the path
  before NET.EXE.

</PRE></OL>11.1.1. DCA 10Net Plus Version 4.20 (10) or Earlier and
<PRE>        DCA 10Net Version 3.3 (40) or Earlier

</PRE>DCA 10Net Plus versions 4.20 (20) and later, and DCA 10Net
versions 3.3 (41) and later, are compatible with MS-DOS 5.0.
If you have an earlier version, contact your network vendor
for an update.
<P>
<PRE>11.2.   Windows Procedure

</PRE>Tiara Computer Systems 10Net (formerly known as DCA 10Net)
versions 4.1 and above are compatible with Windows version
3.1. The Windows part of Setup treats these as Microsoft
Network compatible.
<P>
When setting up Windows for use with TCS 10Net, the
following entry is added to the [386Enh] section of your
SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
TimerCriticalSection=10000
<P>
The TimerCriticalSection value may be set lower on some
versions of 10Net. For more information about this entry,
see the SYSINI.WRI file.
<P>
To set up Windows for use with TCS 10Net version 4.1x with
the DCA 1MB card, run Custom Setup and choose the TCS 10Net
(versions 4.1X with DCA 1M card) network option. The Windows
part of Setup adds the following entries to the [386Enh]
section of your SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
INDOSPolling=TRUE
PSPIncrement=5
TimerCriticalSection=10000
UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
<P>
For more information about these settings, see the
SYSINI.WRI file.
<P>
In addition:
<P>
o If you purchase 10Net for Windows, it will install
<PRE>  additional Windows components that will enhance the
  functionality available in Windows File Manager, Control
  Panel, and Print Manager.

</PRE>o You cannot use File Manager to format floppy disks when
<PRE>  running versions of 10Net prior to 5.0.


</PRE><P><LI>  Farallon PhoneNet Talk Version 2.02 or Earlier
<P>
</OL>Note: Please contact Farallon for information about
<PRE>      running this network with Windows 3.1.  No information
      was available at press time.

</PRE></OL>12.1. MS-DOS Procedure
<P>
To update Farallon PhoneNet Talk version 2.02, replace your
current REDIR.EXE file with the new version included with
the Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0 Upgrade.  It's a good idea to
preserve your current file by renaming it with a different
extension, such as .OLD or .BAK.
<P>
If you are using a PhoneNet Talk version earlier than 2.02,
contact your network vendor for an update.
<P>
To update Farallon PhoneNet Talk version 2.02:

<OL><P><LI>Rename the following file:
<P>
   REDIR.EXE (usually in C:\\PNTALK)

<P><LI>Copy the EXPAND.EXE file on Setup disk 1 to the DOS directory
   on the hard drive.

<P><LI>Open the PACKING.LST file on Setup disk 1 to determine the
   location of the REDIR.2X_ file.

<P><LI>Use the following syntax to expand and copy the new file
   to your network directory:
<P>
   expand [drive1:]redir.2x_ [drive2:][path]redir.exe
<P>
   The [drive1:] parameter specifies the location of the
   compressed file you want to expand. The [drive2:][path]
   parameter specifies the destination for the expanded file.
<P>
   For example, if the REDIR.2X_ file is on a disk in drive
   A, and your REDIR.EXE file is in the PNTALK directory on
   drive C, type this at the command prompt:
<P>
   expand a:\redir.2x_ c:\pntalk\redir.exe
<P>

<P><LI>  Sitka TOPS Version 3.0 or Earlier
<P>
</OL>Note: Please contact Sitka for information about running
<PRE>      this network with Windows 3.1.  No information was
      available at press time.

</PRE></OL>13.1. MS-DOS Procedure
<P>
Sitka TOPS version 3.0 is compatible with MS-DOS version
5.0. However, do not load any TOPS files into the upper
memory area. This might result in memory conflicts that
could cause your system to fail. Do not use the LOADHIGH
command with a TOPS network.
<P>
If your system is a TOPS workstation, the MS-DOS Shell MOVE
command may not work.
<P>
If you are using a TOPS version earlier than 3.0, contact
your network vendor for an update.
<P>

<OL><P><LI>  Invisible Software - NET/30 For Windows

a path to the directory containing your NET/30 files. Your
SYSTEM.INI and WIN.INI files will automatically be updated.
<P>
If you are setting up Windows on a nondedicated file server
and you are sharing a serial printer, you must add a line to
the SYSTEM.INI file. If you are sharing COM1, add the
following line in the [386Enh] section:
<P>
COM1AutoAssign=0
<P>
If you are sharing COM2, add the following line to the
[386Enh] section:
<P>
