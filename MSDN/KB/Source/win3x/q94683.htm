The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows Driver Library (WDL) is no longer available as a
complete disk set from Microsoft. Instead, Microsoft is providing
individual drivers on disk on an as-needed basis to customers that do not
have access to a modem.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft WDL contains device drivers for printers, displays, and
audio devices. These drivers enable these devices to run with
Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1. This library also
contains a few additional items, such as Access Pack for Microsoft
Windows software and a Novell NetWare upgrade.
<P>
Microsoft has released several new and updated drivers since the release of
Windows 3.1. These drivers have been added to the WDL and are available for
download at no charge on the Microsoft Download Service (MSDL), and the
InterNet. However, standard connect-time fees and long-distance telephone
charges, if any, still apply during downloading. You can reach the MSDL by
modem at (425) 936-6735.
<P>
Download WDL.TXT, a list of files included in the WDL, from the Microsoft
Software Library (MSL) on the following services:

obtaining the WDL contents:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q119923</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Obtain an Index of WDL Contents

</PRE>As Microsoft continues to improve existing drivers and introduce new
Windows drivers these drivers will be added the WDL. New drivers are
added often to the WDL and may replace older drivers that were
available on the WDL disk set. The WDL disk set was only updated four
times a year but new WDL drivers are added to the electronic services
(listed above) more often.
<P>
If you do not have access to a modem an individual WDL driver can be
mailed to you on an as-needed basis. Contact Microsoft Product Support
Services to determine if a new driver is needed.
