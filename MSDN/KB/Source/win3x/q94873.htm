<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When running the Full Page Color display driver for Windows that ships
with More Windows by Aristosoft, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   [Application] has caused a General Protection Fault in module
   VGACLR.DRV.

</PRE>Where [Application] is the Windows application that is currently
running.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Aristosoft Technical Support has confirmed that you may get GP faults
in Windows when using the Full Page Color display driver, VGACLR.DRV,
that ships with More Windows.
<P>
More Windows is a Windows application that eliminates the need for
scroll bars in Windows. For example, with More Windows you are able to
scroll to Windows or icons not shown in Program Manager by moving your
mouse to the edge of the Program Manager window.
<P>
More Windows ships several different display drivers, but Aristosoft
has confirmed that the problem only occurs with the Full Page Color
driver.
<P>
As a workaround, you can change your display driver to one of the
other More Windows display drivers, or you can use one of the display
drivers that shipped with Windows. However, using a Windows display
driver will not allow More Windows to work correctly.
<P>
For more information, call Aristosoft Technical Support.
<P>
More Windows is manufactured by Aristosoft, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
