<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Shiva is incorporating support for Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 in its upcoming Shiva Remote 3.1 client software. Shiva
Remote 3.1 works in Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Shiva
Remote 3.1 will be released as the standard client software shipped
with all Shiva products.
<P>

</PRE><h3>Dial-Out Support Included in Shiva Remote 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
Shiva supports shared dial-out from within Windows for Workgroups, using
either IPX or TCP/IP. To connect to a shared communications port across the
LAN, Shiva provides a special communications driver that replaces the
Microsoft communications driver. This driver redirects one of the user's
serial ports to a shared serial port available on the network. These shared
serial ports, on either the Shiva NetModem/E or LanRover, can be pooled to
allow the user to connect to the first available port.
<P>
<P><h3>Availability</h3>
 
<P>
Shiva Remote 3.1 will be released on March 31, 1994. By the end of April
1994, it will be incorporated into all Shiva products, including
LanRover/E, LanRover/T, and NetModem/E. It will also be available upon
release on the Shiva bulletin board service (BBS) and as a nominally priced
upgrade for Shiva customers. Beta versions of Shiva Remote will be
available in February 1994. To apply to be on the beta list, send
electronic mail to mikef@shiva.com, or send a fax to Mike Feinstein at
(617) 270-8599.
<P>
NOTE: The original Shiva Remote 1.0 still supports Windows for Workgroups
3.1 but does not support Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Shiva Remote 1.0 will
only be available on the Shiva BBS in order to support the current
installed base. The Shiva 3.0 MS-DOS client supports remote file sharing
using the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 MS-DOS client software.
<P>
The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
