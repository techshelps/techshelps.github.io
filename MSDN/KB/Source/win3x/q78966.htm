     Questions and Answers: Using MS-DOS Applications with Windows 3.0
     -----------------------------------------------------------------


1. Q. What is a PIF file?

   A. Program information files (PIF) are used by Windows to run
      specific DOS applications correctly. For more information on PIF
      files, see Chapter 12, page 440, in your "Microsoft Windows
      User's Guide" for version 3.0.

2. Q. I am running Windows in 386 enhanced mode and yet I can only run
      one or two DOS applications at a time. Sometimes I can't even
      run one DOS application. How can I correct this problem so that
      I can use my DOS applications?

   A. Windows 3.0 in 386 enhanced mode can run multiple DOS
      applications at the same time provided your computer has
      sufficient memory. Multitasking does take a lot of memory.
      Running just two DOS applications may use more than 1.5
      megabytes (MB) of memory. To help meet this demand, Windows 3.0
      running on a 386 computer can use some of the free space on the
      hard drive as virtual memory.

      If your computer has less than 4 MB of memory, Windows may be
      able to run only one or two DOS applications concurrently, even
      if there are several MB of free space on your hard disk.

      If your computer has only 2 MB of memory and your hard drive has
      less than 4 MB free, then Windows may not be able to run even
      one DOS application. In this case, freeing up an additional 2 or
      3 MB of space on your hard drive that Windows can use as virtual
      memory may let you run these DOS applications.

3. Q. I am trying to run a DOS application that talks to a modem or
      another computer. Every time I switch back to Windows it loses
      the connection. What can I do?

   A. If you are running Windows on a 286 computer or in standard or
      real mode on a 386 computer, DOS applications cannot be run in
      the background. When you switch to another program, the previous
      application is put on hold. Programs that require constant
      contact with a modem or other communications device will not run
      properly in real or standard mode when you switch back to
      Windows or switch to another application.

      If you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode and have 4 MB or
      more of memory, by making the following changes to its PIF file,
      you may be able to run in the background a DOS application that
      requires constant contact with a modem.

      Note: If you are not familiar with Windows PIF files and the PIF
      Editor, we recommend that you review Chapter 12 of your
      "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0 before carrying
      out this procedure.

      a. Using the PIF Editor, open the PIF file for your DOS
         application.

      b. In the main PIF Editor dialog box, enable the "Background"
         option by clicking its box. An "X" will appear to show that
         this option is enabled.

      c. Click "Advanced" to open the Advanced Options dialog box.

      d. In the section labeled "Multitasking Options," if
         there is an X in the box for "Detect Idle Time," click it to
         turn it off.

      e. Click OK to exit Advanced Options, then select "File" and
         "Save" to save these changes.

      For more information on enabling your DOS applications to
      multitask see pages 461 through 465 of your "Microsoft Windows
      User's Guide" for version 3.0.
