The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You may install Microsoft Windows version 3.0, then later want to copy or
move it to a new location (on another directory, drive, or system).
Although this is not a problem with Windows versions 2.x, such an action
causes difficulties with Windows version 3.0. We recommend making a
complete new installation if it is necessary to change the Windows 3.0
location.
<P>
If you must move the existing installation, you must make the following
modifications:

<OL><P><LI>Modify any entries in your .INI files that contain absolute paths (such
   as PROGMAN.INI and any others such as the [HPPCL,LPT2] section of the
   WIN.INI).

<P><LI>Your PIF files may contain the absolute paths to various
   applications that might differ on another system. These must be
   either recreated by Setup or modified by hand with the PIF Editor.

<P><LI>Your Program Manager group (GRP) files contain absolute paths, both
   to the Windows accessories and to any other applications detected by
   the Setup program. The standard groups normally created by Setup must
   be modified by hand with an ASCII text editor, such as Notepad. Setup
   can be used to help re-create the Windows Applications and Non-Windows
   Applications groups.

<P><LI>If you have changed machine types, you should run the character
   mode Setup on the target system before starting Windows and
   adjust any settings as necessary.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you move your Windows installation from one machine to another by
copying the files with the MS-DOS program XCOPY.EXE or third-party programs
such as Laplink Release III or Brooklyn Bridge, then the following error
messages will appear if the SYSTEM subdirectory located in the WINDOWS
directory is not copied at the same time:
<P>
<PRE>Command         Message
</PRE></OL> 
<P>
<PRE>win            "Cannot find KERNEL.EXE needed to run in real mode;
                check to ensure the path is correct or reinstall
                Windows."

win /s          "Cannot find DOSX.EXE needed to run in standard mode;
                 check to ensure the path is correct or reinstall
                 Windows."

win /3         "Cannot find WIN386.EXE needed to run in 386 enhanced
                 mode; check to ensure the path is correct or reinstall
                 Windows."

</PRE>The SYSTEM directory could be copied over to the new machine, but this
is an improper installation and may not run correctly.
<P>
The only correct way to install Windows 3.0 on a computer is to run
the SETUP.EXE Setup program.
