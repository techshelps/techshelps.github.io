The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
 
<P>
If you run Microsoft Windows configured for a Microsoft LAN Manager 2.0 or
2.1 enhanced (or 100% compatible) network, and the network is currently
loaded with the NetPopup service active, you cannot start Windows without
WinPopup being loaded.
<P>
If you remove WinPopup from the LOAD= line in the WIN.INI file, and you
exit Windows and restart Windows while the NetPopup service is active,
WinPopup is added back to the LOAD= line. This occurs because NetPopup
determines that Windows is active and then checks to determine if WinPopup
is there. If it WinPopup isn't already there, NetPopup adds it.
<P>
If you want to remove WinPopup, you must first prevent NetPopup from being
automatically loaded. This article describes that procedure.

<P><h3>Preventing NetPopup From Loading Automatically</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Switch to the directory that contains the LANMAN.INI file. The
   default is C:\LANMAN.DOS.

<P><LI>Make a backup copy of the LANMAN.INI file.

<P><LI>Open LANMAN.INI with a text editor, such as Notepad.

<P><LI>In the [workstation] section, find the following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      WRKSERVICES=
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove NETPOPUP from the WRKSERVICES= line, and save the file.

<P><LI>Restart the network.

<P><LI>Open the WIN.INI file with a text editor, such as Notepad.

<P><LI>Remove WinPopup from the LOAD= line, and save the file.

<P><LI>Restart Windows and the WinPopup icon should not be present.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Any messages received are not displayed but are written to the
MESSAGES.LOG file that is in the LOGS subdirectory under the LANMAN.DOS
directory and can be viewed using any text editor, such as Notepad.
<P>
<P><h3>Restarting NetPopup</h3>
 
<P>
After exiting Windows, if you desire to start the NetPopup service,
type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   net start netpopup

</PRE></OL>NOTE: To end this service, you must restart the network. If you run
NetPopup and then start Windows while this service is active, it adds
WinPopup back in the LOAD= line.
<P>
The NET PAUSE NETPOPUP command does not work because message service is
still active, although it does not send any messages through.
