The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a list of the PS/2 BIOS problems corrected by the various
versions of IBM's DASDDRVR.SYS patch file:

<UL><LI>Intermittent "Not ready error reading drive A:"

<LI>Intermittent "General failure" errors reading a fixed disk drive

<LI>"Track 0 bad, or invalid media" when formatting multiple 3.5-inch
   disks

<LI>301 and 8602 errors when the system is powered off and on
   quickly

<LI>162 and 163 errors with loss of date and time

<LI>Being prompted for password (on warm boot) even though password
   security is not implemented or incorrectly told password already
   exists when installing the power-on password function
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The first three corrections listed above were originally provided on the PC-
DOS version 3.3 patch disk. The DASDDRVR.SYS file (also called DOS33FIX)
was 648 bytes.
<P>
The next two corrections were added in the next version, which was 698
bytes, and included on all version 1.02 Reference Disks (50/60 and 70/80).
<P>
The last correction was added on all 50/60 and 70/80 Reference Disks,
versions 1.03 or later. It is now up to 734 bytes.
<P>
<P><h3>PS/2 Models Affected</h3>
 
<P>
The IBM System Update Diskette, DASDDRVR.SYS version 1.56, affects the
following PS/2 models: 30-286, 50, 50Z, 55SX, 60, 70, 80, and PC-DOS 3.3
and 4.0.
<P>
<P><h3>DASDDRVR's Load Procedure</h3>
 
<P>
When the DASDDRVR patch is loaded from CONFIG.SYS, it looks at the system
model ID and submodel bytes, as well as the BIOS date. If these don't match
what it is looking for, DASDDRVR doesn't even apply the patches. All you do
is waste a small piece of disk space. Later versions of DASDDRVR than those
mentioned here may apply to other model PS/2 machines. When in doubt, load
DASDDRVR.
<P>
NOTE: DASDDRVR.SYS should not be loaded high.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes on Use of DASDDRVR.SYS with Windows</h3>
 
<P>
Proper functioning of Microsoft Windows (all versions) and all Windows
applications requires that DASDDRVR.SYS be loaded upon installing and
running these programs as described here.
<P>
<P><h3>Note on PS/2 Model 30-286</h3>
 
<P>
The 30-286 also has a DASDDRVR.SYS, but this is not the same DASDDRVR file
and corrects entirely different problems. The Model 55 Reference Disk does
(unintentionally) contain the 734-byte DASDDRVR file, but it is not needed.
<P>
<P><h3>Obtaining the IBM PS/2 System Update Diskette</h3>
 
<P>
You can obtain the free IBM PS/2 System Update Diskette from IBM PC Books
and Software.
<P>
These facts were obtained from the IBM National Support Center PC User's
Group Bulletin Board. For more information on DASDDRVR.SYS, please contact
your local IBM representative.
<P>
The IBM products included here were manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
