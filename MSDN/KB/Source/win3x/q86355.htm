<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows &amp; MS-DOS 5 Upgrade
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was taken from the Windows &amp; MS-DOS 5
Upgrade SETUP.TXT file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MICROSOFT WINDOWS 3.1 &amp; MS-DOS 5 UPGRADE
<P>
SETUP.TXT
 
<P>
This file provides important information not included in the
"Microsoft Getting Started" manual, the "Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide
and Reference," the "Windows User's Guide" or in online Help.
<P>
Specifically, this file contains information about problems that might
occur while running the Windows and MS-DOS Setup program and describes
problems that can occur when using terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
programs or drivers with Windows or the Windows and MS-DOS Setup
program. If you are using a TSR or if you encounter problems setting
up Windows version 3.1, read this document BEFORE running Setup again.
<P>
For information about other files and documentation, see the "Welcome"
section of "Getting Started."
<P>
Note: Within this document, "Windows Setup" refers to the Windows part
of the Windows and MS-DOS Setup program.  You can execute the Windows
only part of this program by following the instructions below:
<P>
When this file instructs you to run Windows Setup, do the following:
<P>
--If this file instructs you to run Setup from the Main Group within
<PRE>  the Windows Program Manager, carry out the procedure as stated.

</PRE>--If you have not installed Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS,
<PRE>  carry out the procedure described in "Getting Started."

</PRE>--If you have installed Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS, and this
<PRE>  file does not instruct you to run Setup from the Main Group,
  carry out the following procedure to run Setup for Windows only:

  1. Make drive C your current drive.
  2. Insert Setup Disk #1 into drive A.
  3. Type the following at the command prompt:
        a:setup /w

  This procedure for running a "Windows only" setup after MS-DOS has
  been installed is also described in Appendix A of "Getting Started."


</PRE>General Setup Notes for the Windows portion of Setup
 
<P>
This section includes notes on specific system configurations that may
prevent Setup from installing Windows successfully. A solution to each
problem is provided.
<P>
If you are using a hardware or software product listed here, follow
the proposed recommendations before running Setup.
<P>
MS-DOS Screen Savers
 
<P>
If you are using an MS-DOS screen saver, you should disable it before
running Setup. These screen savers can cause problems when running
Setup.
<P>
AT&amp;T Safari Computer
 
If you have an AT&amp;T Safari computer, you cannot maintain two versions
of Windows (version 3.0 and version 3.1) on your system. You must
upgrade over version 3.0. If you set up Windows 3.1 in its own
directory, Windows will not use the special drivers required for it to
run on the Safari computer.
<P>
<P>
Using the TIGA Display Driver
 
After successfully setting up Windows, you can increase the amount of
conventional memory available to non-Windows applications when Windows
is running in 386 enhanced mode by loading TIGACD.EXE from the
WINSTART.BAT file. The WINSTART.BAT file runs only in 386 enhanced
mode. If you want to run Windows in standard mode, you must load
TIGACD.EXE manually. For more information, see the README.WRI online
document.
<P>
<P>
Displays That Are Incompatible with Windows Version 3.1
 
Certain display adapters can cause problems with Windows version 3.1.
The most serious problem is a system failure while running the Windows
and MS-DOS Setup program. If you encounter this problem, run Custom
Setup, and then select one of the standard display types, such as VGA,
provided with Windows version 3.1.
<P>
With other display drivers, Windows may be set up successfully but
TrueType fonts may not appear correctly on your screen. An updated
driver may be available in the Windows Driver Library or from your
display vendor or manufacturer. For information about obtaining the
Windows Driver Library, see "You have special hardware to set up with
Windows" in Chapter 3, "Troubleshooting During Setup," in "Getting
Started."
<P>
The following display adapters may cause problems:
<P>
-  ATI Graphics Ultra and Vantage
<P>
<PRE>   Note: These adapters are 8514/a-compatible and run well
         with the 8514/a driver provided with Windows 3.1.

</PRE>- All DGIS display adapters (Direct Graphics Interface Standard)
<PRE>  from Graphic Software Systems, including the following:
        NEC MultiSynch Graphics Engine (MGE)
        Zenith Z-649
        HP IGC-10, IGC-20
        GSS 1000 Series

   NOTE: Some DGIS-based adapters are TIGA-compatible and
         run well when used with the appropriate TIGACD.EXE
         MS-DOS driver and with the TIGA driver provided with
         Windows 3.1.

</PRE>- HP Ultra VGA
- IBM Image Adapter/A
- Matrox MG Series/M-WIN Series
- Palettized VGA 640x480, 16-color (provided with Windows
<PRE>  Multimedia Extensions version 1.0)
</PRE>- Radius SVGA MultiView
<P>
- All RGDI (Renaissance Graphics Device Interface) display
<PRE>  adapters from Appian, Inc., including the following:
       Appian Rendition II, IIe, II/XE, and III
       Appian GV1024
       Decpc 433

</PRE>- All S3 adapters, including the following:
<PRE>      Orchid Fahrenheit 1280
      STB WIND/X
      Diamond Stealth VRAM


</PRE><h3>Using Stacker</h3>
 
If you are using Stacker to compress your hard disk, there are certain
steps you need to take before setting up Windows.
*  Before you run Setup, install MS-DOS 5.0 manually. For
<PRE>   instructions, see section 2.21 of the README.TXT file.

</PRE>*  If you have not set up MS-DOS 5.0, and you want to set up
<PRE>   Windows only on a computer with an older version of Stacker,
   your computer might halt on Setup disk 3 while it is analyzing
   your system software. If this happens, remove the Setup disk,
   restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL, and run
   Setup again by typing the following at the command prompt:

   a:setup /w /c

   Note: Before you run Setup again, make sure all the commands
         that load memory-resident programs have been disabled
         in your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. To disable
         a command, type "rem" and a space in front of the command
         in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Then save the file,
         and restart your computer.


</PRE>*  If you want to use a swap file with Windows, you must
<PRE>   set up the swap file on the uncompressed drive. When
   setting up Stacker, you can leave at least 1 megabyte (MB)
   of disk space uncompressed for storing system files. To
   leave enough space for the swap file, it is recommended
   that the amount of uncompressed disk space equal at least
   twice the amount of system memory. For example, if your
   system has 4 MB of memory, you should leave at least 8 MB
   of disk space uncompressed. For more information about
   swap files, see "Working with Windows Swap Files" in Chapter 14,
   "Optimizing Windows," in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."

   If Stacker is already set up on your system and there is not
   enough uncompressed disk space for a swap file, you can run
   the STAC utility provided with Stacker to increase the amount
   of uncompressed disk space. For more information, see your
   Stacker documentation.

</PRE>*  If you upgraded from an earlier version of Stacker to
<PRE>   Stacker 2.0 or later, choose the Custom Setup option
   when you run Setup. When Setup prompts you, don't choose to let
   Setup modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Modify
   these files yourself after Setup is complete by carrying out
   the following steps:

   * In your AUTOEXEC.BAT, add Windows to your path.

   * Copy the HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE files to your
     uncompressed drive, unless you use a different memory
     manager, such as QEMM-386.

   * Add DEVICE commands for HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE to
     your CONFIG.SYS file, unless you use a different memory
     manager such as QEMM-386. The command lines that load
     these drivers should appear before the command that loads
     STACKER.COM.

   * Make sure a copy of SMARTDRV.EXE is on the
     uncompressed drive. In your CONFIG.SYS file, the
     SMARTDRV.EXE command line should include the
     "/double_buffer" switch and should be the path
     of the file at boot time. For example, if SMARTDRV.EXE
     is in the root directory at boot time, you would include
     the following command in your CONFIG.SYS:

     DEVICE=C:\SMARTDRV.EXE /DOUBLE_BUFFER

     SMARTDRV.EXE should be loaded before STACKER.COM in the
     CONFIG.SYS file.

   * In the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, the SMARTDRV.EXE command
     line should be the path of the file after disk drives
     are swapped. Also, add the /L switch to the SMARTDRV.EXE
     command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

</PRE>*  If you are using Stacker version 2.0 or later, but didn't
<PRE>   upgrade from Stacker version 1.1, choose the Express Setup
   option when you are prompted. Setup will modify your CONFIG.SYS
   and AUTOEXEC.BAT files for you. When Setup is finished making
   the modifications, it displays a message at the end
   of the Windows portion of Setup that notifies you of the
   modifications that have been made. If you have used Stacker to
   swap your startup drive, when you restart your system Stacker will
   ask whether you want to update to the new version of the
   CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Choose Yes.

</PRE>*  If you are using a version of Stacker earlier than 2.0, you
<PRE>   need to modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
   yourself, using the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN files that
   Setup generates. For information about using these files,
   see "Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself,"
   following this topic.

</PRE>*  After you have set up MS-DOS manually, type the following at
<PRE>   the command prompt to set up Windows:

   a:setup /w


</PRE><h3>Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself</h3>
 
When you set up Windows, Setup usually places the HIMEM.SYS,
SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE files in the Windows directory.
If the Windows directory is on a disk that is not available
when you start your computer, such as a removable or nonlocal
disk, or if Setup detects one of the following conditions,
Setup does not modify the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
- Your boot drive has been modified by a disk-compression
<PRE>  utility.

</PRE>- Your CONFIG.SYS file contains references to block device
<PRE>  drivers.

</PRE>- There is not enough available space on your hard disk to
<PRE>  copy the files.

</PRE>- The files are already installed on your system and Setup
<PRE>  cannot overwrite them (they are read-only).

</PRE>- The path in your AUTOEXEC.BAT is too long.
<P>
Instead, Setup writes proposed changes to the CONFIG.WIN and
AUTOEXEC.WIN or the CONFIG.00x and AUTOEXEC.00x files.
In this case, you must either move the HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE,
and EMM386.EXE files to a drive that is available when you start
your computer, or use a text editor to modify your CONFIG.SYS or
AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that any references to HIMEM.SYS,
SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE appear after the DEVICE=
command line used to load the drivers for your disk drives. Refer
to the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN or the CONFIG.00x and
AUTOEXEC.00x files for the proposed changes.
<P>
Setting Up XGA on a PS/2 Model 75 or 90
 
If you have a PS/2 model 75 or 90 with an XGA, the
Windows and MS-DOS Setup program will configure
the display adapter for 16-color, 640x480 resolution.
Do not change this configuration during Setup.
Specifying a different XGA configuration while setting
up Windows may cause Setup to fail.
<P>
After you have successfully installed Windows, you can
configure your XGA to use a different resolution or 256 colors,
if your monitor supports it. For more information on how to do
this, see the topic "IBM XGA" in the README.WRI online
document.
<P>
If you are using the plasma screen on the PS/2 model 75, use
ONLY the 640x480, 16-color configuration. If you change this
configuration, you will be returned to the MS-DOS prompt when
you try to start Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Correcting the "Out of Environment Space" Error Message</h3>
 
If you receive an "out of environment space" message when
starting Windows, you can either:
<P>
*  Increase the size of your environment by adding the SHELL=
<PRE>   command line to your CONFIG.SYS file. See your MS-DOS
   documentation for more information about the SHELL command
   and modifying your CONFIG.SYS file.

</PRE>*  Move the SET commands in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
<PRE>   to the beginning of the file so that they run before the
   commands that load terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
   programs or drivers, such as SMARTDrive.

</PRE>If Setup Does Not Detect Your Network
 
If you have a network installed, you choose Custom Setup,
and Setup specifies "No Network" in the System-Information
screen, Setup is not able to detect your network. For Setup to
detect certain networks, the directory that contains the
network program files must be included in your path.
<P>
This is a known problem with these networks: 3Share, 3Open,
LAN Manager, and MSNet. If your path does not include the
directory where the network files are located, you can either:
<P>
*  Add the directory to the PATH line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
<PRE>   file.

</PRE>*  Run Custom Setup again and specify the full path for your
<PRE>   network in the System-Information screen.

</PRE>Using Terminate-and-Stay-Resident (TSR) Programs and Drivers
with Windows Version 3.1
 
<P>
The Program Listing section of this document lists several
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs and drivers that
are known to cause problems when running with Windows version
3.1. Some of the problems you may encounter include system
failures or an incorrect display of information on your screen.
In some cases, special steps are provided to solve the problems.
<P>
While setting up Windows version 3.1, the Windows portion of
Setup searches the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files
for references to TSR programs and drivers, in addition to
scanning memory for TSRs that are currently running. If Setup
detects a TSR that is known to cause problems when running
with Windows version 3.1, a message appears, asking whether
you want to continue or quit Setup.
<P>
If you receive such a message, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Locate your TSR in the Program Listing section of this document
   and use the information to determine if the situation encountered
   prevents Windows Setup from successfully installing Windows 3.1.

<P><LI>If the situation does not affect Windows Setup, you can continue
   setting up Windows 3.1 by following the instructions on your
   screen.
<P>
   If the situation does affect Windows Setup and prevents it from
   installing Windows on your computer, follow the instructions
   on the screen to quit Setup, and then complete the following
   steps.

<P><LI>Quit the TSR and remove all references to it from your
   AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. For more information,
   see the documentation for your TSR.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.

<P><LI>Run Windows Setup again.
<P>
</OL>After Windows is successfully set up, you may want to restore
your TSRs.
<P>
Not all TSRs or drivers included in the Program Listing section
are detected by Setup. The TSRs and drivers that Setup detects
are in the SETUP.INF file, listed under the names "incomptsr1"
and "incomptsr2".
<P>
<P><h2>Program Listing</h2>
 
This section describes some problems, discovered during testing, that
you might encounter while using a TSR with Windows version 3.1. It
does not include all possible problems that can occur.
<P>
<P><h3>386MAX</h3>
 
The documentation for 386MAX recommends against setting the EXT
parameter below 64. If you set this parameter to 0, Windows Setup and
Windows running in standard mode will fail.
<P>
See the README.WRI online document for more information about running
386MAX with Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>386MAX Disk-Cache Utility (QCACHE.EXE)</h3>
 
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive.
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, which is installed with Windows
3.1, instead.
<P>
<P><h3>All Charge 386 Version 3.1</h3>
 
ALLEMM4.SYS is a memory manager that causes problems with Setup and
Windows 3.1. If you encounter problems running this program with
Windows, it is recommended that you use EMM386.EXE and HIMEM.SYS,
provided with Windows 3.1, to manage memory instead.
<P>
<P><h3>Anarkey Version 4.00</h3>
 
With some memory configurations, Anarkey version 4.00 running with
Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode may cause unpredictable system
failures. In rare cases, this program can also corrupt hard-disk data.
In addition, Windows 3.1 might not start when this program is running.
<P>
Do not run Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode when Anarkey version
4.00 is running. Version 4.01 may correct these problems. Contact
Moderne Software for a free upgrade of Anarkey 4.01.
<P>
<P><h3>Anarkey Version 4.01</h3>
 
If Anarkey version 4.01 is loaded before starting Windows in standard
mode, it is not available in any MS-DOS Prompt that you start from
Windows. In this case, it is recommended that you load Anarkey from
each MS-DOS Prompt, as needed.
<P>
Do not load Anarkey HIGH before starting Windows in 386 enhanced mode.
If you load Anarkey HIGH, your system may fail when you try to start
an application.
<P>
<P><h3>APPEND (MS-DOS)</h3>
 
Do not use the APPEND utility with Windows 3.1. It prevents Windows
and Windows applications from creating valid Well-Formed-Path (WFP)
names for the files they are using. (A WFP is the complete name of a
file, including the drive letter and full path specification, starting
from the root directory.)
<P>
<P><h3>ASP Integrity Toolkit Version 3.7</h3>
 
This product is a virus-protection program that can cause problems
when running Windows Setup, including system failure, automatic
restarting of the system, and the inability to use the keyboard. You
should turn off protection in the toolkit before setting up Windows
3.1. For information about how to do this, see your ASP Integrity
documentation.
<P>
Note: Setting up Windows is considered a system-administration
<PRE>      task. The ASP Integrity Toolkit documentation instructs
      you to turn off protection when performing these types
      of tasks.

</PRE></OL><h3>ASSIGN.COM</h3>
 
If you are using this MS-DOS utility to reassign a drive letter,
change the drive back to its original letter by typing the following
at the command prompt before you run Setup:
<P>
assign
<P>
<P><h3>Autocon Version 2.0e</h3>
 
Autocon enables you to select up to fifty different configurations
when starting your system. To do this, it modifies the CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, based on information in its database
(AUTOCON.DAT), when you restart your system from within AUTOCON.
<P>
Windows Setup modifies only the first section in the CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. If you want to use specific configurations
with Windows, you must run Autocon and then manually edit the
configurations in the database that you want to use. You must do
this after setting up Windows. For your changes to take effect,
you must restart your system from within Autocon. For more
information, see your Autocon documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Bootcon Version 1.60</h3>
 
Using Bootcon, you can maintain different system-configuration
information in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You can then
select the configuration you want to use from a menu when starting
your system.
<P>
Windows Setup modifies only the first section in the CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You must edit the sections of those files
that contain the configurations you want to use after you set up
Windows. For more information, see your Bootcon documentation.
<P>
BOOT.SYS
 
Using BOOT.SYS, you can maintain different system-configuration
information in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You can then
select the configuration you want to use from a menu when starting
your system.
<P>
Windows Setup modifies only the first section in the CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You must edit the sections of those files
that contain the configurations you want to use after you set
up Windows. For more information, see your BOOT.SYS documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Bootsafe</h3>
 
If you are running Bootsafe, you may experience problems while
running Setup. Carry out the following procedure:
<P>
1    Open your AUTOEXEC.BAT with any text editor.
2    Type "REM" and a space in front of the line that loads
<PRE>     Bootsafe. For example, the line might look something like this:

     rem c:\cpav\bootsafe

</PRE>3    Save the file, and restart your computer by pressing
<PRE>     CTRL+ALT+DEL.
</PRE>4    Run Setup again.
<P>
<P><h3>CACHE.EXE Disk-Cache Utility</h3>
 
Do not use two disk-cache utilities with Windows 3.1. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows 3.1, and
remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If CACHE.EXE is detected, Setup
removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)
<P>
<P><h3>CACHE.SYS Disk-Cache Utility</h3>
 
This disk-cache utility will not work properly with SMARTDrive. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows 3.1, and
remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If CACHE.SYS is detected, Setup
removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)
<P>
<P><h3>CED Version 1.0e</h3>
 
Using CED with Windows 3.1 may cause problems, including system
failure. It is recommended that you do not use CED with Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Central Point Anti-Virus Version 1.1 (VSAFE.COM/VSAFE.SYS)</h3>
 
VSAFE.COM/VSAFE.SYS should not be loaded when you set up Windows 3.1.
Otherwise, Setup may not run properly. After you set up Windows 3.1,
you can load VSAFE.
<P>
Because Windows uses the disk for memory swapping, you should turn off
the VSAFE write-protection option when running Windows. For more
information, see the Central Point Anti-Virus documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>CMDEDIT.COM Version 2.0 (Date 12-6-91)</h3>
 
If this command-line editor is loaded before starting Windows, it may
cause a General Protection Fault when running multiple MS-DOS Prompts
in 386 enhanced mode. Also, it cannot be loaded from an MS-DOS Prompt
within Windows when Windows is running in standard mode.
<P>
<P><h3>Cubit Version 3.01</h3>
 
When using Cubit with Windows 3.1, do not compress the Windows SYSTEM
directory or any file that is loaded from the CONFIG.SYS file.
Compressing these files could cause problems.
<P>
Before upgrading to Windows 3.1, make sure that the earlier version of
Windows is uncompressed on your hard disk. You may recompress the
files after you have successfully set up Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Data Physician Plus Version 2.0 (VirALERT)</h3>
 
It is recommended that you do not set up Windows while VirALERT is
running. If you do, VirALERT will display a warning message every few
seconds while Setup is running.
<P>
After you have set up Windows, you can run VirALERT. Press ALT+V to
display the VirALERT menu. You can use the commands on this menu to
disable and enable VirALERT.
<P>
<P><h3>DOSCUE.COM Command-Line Editor</h3>
 
The DOSCUE command-line editor produces unexpected results when used
with Windows version 3.1. It is recommended that you do not use this
editor with Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Doubledisk Version 2.5</h3>
 
Windows 3.1 may try to access "phantom" disk drives if you use
Doubledisk with Windows 3.1. Phantom drives occur when you
use Doubledisk to create a compressed drive. For example, if you
have drives A, B, and C on your computer and you use Doubledisk
to create drive F, Windows 3.1 (and MS-DOS) recognize drives D
and E as valid drives, even though they do not actually exist. You
can use the DRVOFF utility to prevent Windows from recognizing
phantom drives. Contact Vertisoft to order a copy of the DRVOFF
utility.
<P>
<P><h3>FASTOPEN (MS-DOS)</h3>
 
FASTOPEN is a RAM resident utility. Problems involving the file
allocation table (FAT) may occur if FASTOPEN is used together with
disk de-fragmenting utilities. In low-memory situations, you may need
to remove FASTOPEN for Windows 3.1 to run properly.
<P>

AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you need to disable it when setting up Windows 3.1,
especially if you are upgrading over a previous version of Windows.
Erase Protect tries to save copies of all deleted files, which can
cause you to run out of disk space while running Setup. It is
recommended that you run Erase Protect with a permanent swap file, not
a temporary swap file. If you are using a temporary swap file, you
need to exclude files with a .TMP or .SWP extension from erase
protection.
