The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
This article contains information about using Windows for Workgroups
with third-party products or configurations that have not been tested
and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, use a supported configuration or contact the manufacturer of
the third-party product for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The IBM LAN Server 1.3 network operating system is a Server Message
Block (SMB) compliant network and can be accessed from Windows for
Workgroups workstations with Microsoft LAN Manager connectivity using
the procedure outlined in this article.
<P>
Microsoft can ensure connectivity between Windows for Workgroups and
Microsoft LAN Manager or Novell NetWare only. Although the information
stated in this article may allow Windows for Workgroups and LAN Server
to coexist, Microsoft does not ensure the stability of Windows for
Workgroups running with this configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the following procedure to access a LAN Server network:

<OL><P><LI>At least one Windows for Workgroups machine on the network MUST use
   the LAN Server Domain name as its Workgroup name.

<P><LI>To install Microsoft LAN Manager as a secondary network, open
   Control Panel and choose the Network icon.
<P>
   Similar to Microsoft LAN Manager, IBM LAN Server is an SMB-compliant
   network that can interact with Windows for Workgroups as long as the
   same transport protocol (NetBEUI, for example) is used. The LAN
   Manager driver must be selected because Windows for Workgroups does
   not contain a specific LAN Server driver that would allow access and
   logon to a LAN Server Domain.

<P><LI>Under Options, select Networks.

<P><LI>Select Microsoft LAN Manager and choose the Add button so that it
   appears in the Other Networks In Use section.

<P><LI>Select Microsoft LAN Manager, choose the Settings button, and then
   select the appropriate Domain and/or Password settings.

<P><LI>The above procedure should permit LAN Server LOGON, but the HOME
   directory may still be inaccessible.
<P>
</OL>For more information on connecting to a LAN Server HOME directory,
query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   directory and home and ibm and lan and server and share

</PRE></OL>Windows for Workgroups will automatically reestablish the connection
to the HOME directory (although it may be inaccessible) and any other
directory that the user has rights to each time Windows for Workgroups
is started. A user can also access two separate servers using the same
user identification without the passwords being identical with Windows
for Workgroups. With a LAN Server-only connection, this function would
require that the passwords be identical.
<P>
For additional information, contact IBM Technical Support.
<P>
LAN Server is manufactured by IBM, a vendor independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
