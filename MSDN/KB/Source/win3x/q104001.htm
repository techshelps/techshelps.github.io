The following information applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists the steps needed to install a video driver from the
Microsoft Download Service (MSDL) on a network installation of Windows or
Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h3>NOTES</h3>
 

<UL><LI>In this example, the SETUP /A (the network administrative setup) is
   set up to F:\WINSHARE and the SETUP /N (network node setup) is set up
   to the user's local hard disk in the C:\WIN31 directory and the video
   driver from the MSDL is S3.EXE. Replace these directory names and
   driver names with the names specific to your installation.

<LI>This procedure does NOT apply to network MSDL printer driver
   installations.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Log on as Supervisor or Administrator (or an equivalent with
    FULL rights) to the workstation that requires the upgraded video
    driver.

<P><LI>Go to the WINSHARE directory on drive F.

<P><LI>Create a subdirectory called S3 and then change to that
    subdirectory.

<P><LI>Copy the file S3.EXE to the S3 subdirectory (F:\WINSHARE\S3), type
    "S3" (without the quotation marks) to extract the files, then delete
    the file S3.EXE.

<P><LI>Ensure that the PATH statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file (or in your
    login script) is correct. It should be similar to the following:
<P>
       path=c:\win31;f:\winshare;c:\dos

<P><LI>Use the EXPAND command in the Windows directory to decompress all
    the files in the S3 subdirectory by typing:
<P>
       expand -r *.*

<P><LI>Delete the uncompressed files by typing:
<P>
       del *.??_

<P><LI>Rename the expanded files by typing the following (in the given
    order), pressing ENTER after each line:
<P>
       ren *.fo *.fon
       ren *.lg *.lgo
       ren *.38 *.386
       ren *.rl *.rle
       ren *.?g *.?gr
       ren *.dr *.drv

<P><LI>Copy the OEMSETUP.INF file to the root directory of drive C and
    delete the OEMSETUP.INF file in the S3 subdirectory.

<P><LI>Change to the WINSHARE subdirectory and remove the read-only
    attribute on the files in the WINSHARE subdirectory by typing the
    following at the F:\WINSHARE prompt:
<P>
       attrib -r *.*
<P>
    NOTE: It may also be necessary to take off any network-specific flags.

<P><LI>Change to the S3 subdirectory and copy all the files from the S3
    subdirectory to the WINSHARE subdirectory as follows:
<P>
       copy *.* \winshare

<P><LI>Delete the files in the S3 subdirectory with the following
    command:
<P>
       del *.*

<P><LI>Type the following command:
<P>
       copy c:\oemsetup.inf f:\winshare\s3

<P><LI>Type the following command:
<P>
       del c:\oemsetup.inf

<P><LI>Change to the WINSHARE subdirectory and make the files in the
    WINSHARE subdirectory read-only by typing the following:
<P>
       attrib +r *.*
<P>
    NOTE: It may also be necessary to replace any network-specific flags.

<P><LI>Change to the WIN31 subdirectory.

<P><LI>Run Setup and choose Display, then select "Other (Requires Disk
    Provided by a Hardware Manufacturer)." When prompted for the location
    of the files, type "f:\winshare" (without the quotation marks) and
    choose the appropriate driver from the list that appears.
<P>
    This ends Setup, returns you to the C:\WIN31 directory, and creates
    an OEM0.INF file. If you install more than one MSDL driver, the
    OEM&lt;#&gt;.INF file is incremented (for example, OEM1.INF, OEM2.INF,
    and so on).

<P><LI>Restart Windows.
<P></OL>
