The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The AnyKey keyboard on your Gateway 2000 computer performs incorrectly or
doesn't respond.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you accidentally or incorrectly reprogram a key or key combination on
this keyboard, certain keys may perform incorrectly or may not respond at
all. This may cause you to assume there is a problem with either MS-DOS or
Microsoft Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you program your AnyKey keyboard incorrectly, you must reprogram the
key(s) involved or reset the keyboard to restore normal functionality. You
cannot restore keyboard functionality by restarting your computer or by
unplugging the keyboard or computer.
<P>
To determine whether you have the AnyKey model of the Gateway 2000
keyboard, look at the diagram on page 3-12 of your "Gateway 2000 Computer
System User's Guide." The AnyKey keyboard has a red Program indicator light
in the upper right corner, above the numeric keypad. The AnyKey keyboard
also has two complete sets of function keys, one across the top and one on
the left side of the keyboard.
<P>
<P><h3>Reprogramming a Key on the AnyKey Keyboard</h3>
 
<P>
Use the following instructions to reprogram a key on the AnyKey keyboard:

<OL><P><LI>Press the REMAP key.

<P><LI>Press the key (or key combination) you want to reprogram.
<P>
   For example, to remap the F9 key, press F9.

<P><LI>Press the key (or key combination) you want to map to the key you
   pressed in step 2 above. If you want to remap the key to itself,
   press the key you pressed in step 2 again (that is, to reset a key,
   press REMAP, then press the key you want to reset twice.
<P>
   For example, to restore the original functionality of the F9 key, press
   F9 again.
<P>
</OL><h3>Resetting the Entire AnyKey Keyboard</h3>
 
<P>
When your keyboard is malfunctioning due to incorrect AnyKey programming,
you may be unable to determine which keys to reset, especially if more than
one key or a key combination has been reprogrammed. In this case, you may
need to reset the entire keyboard.
<P>
To reset the entire AnyKey keyboard to the default settings, press
CTRL+ALT+SUSPEND MACRO. The Program indicator light on the keyboard flashes
for a few seconds. When the Program light stops flashing, the process is
complete.
<P>
NOTE: This procedure only works if the CTRL or ALT keys have not been
reprogrammed. If the Program indicator light does not flash when you press
CTRL+ALT+SUSPEND MACRO, you must reset the CTRL and ALT keys individually,
using the procedure in the preceding section (for example, to reset the
CTRL key, press REMAP, CTRL, CTRL). After you reset the CTRL and ALT keys,
you can reset the entire keyboard.
<P>
