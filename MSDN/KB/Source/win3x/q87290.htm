The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A "clean boot" (starting your computer after all unnecessary commands have
been removed from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files) is used as a
basic troubleshooting step to test possible conflicts between Windows 3.1
and various terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs and device drivers.
There are different types of clean boots; the correct one to use depends on
whether or not Microsoft Windows has been installed.
<P>
More information about clean booting can be found on pages 99-100 of the
"Getting Started with Microsoft Windows" version 3.1 manual and on
pages 528-531 of the version 3.1 "Microsoft Windows Users Guide."
<P>
NOTE: This article explains how to clean boot your system up to the point
when you start Windows. To start Windows without loading any third-party
programs, you must clear the StartUp group, clear the LOAD= and RUN=
entries in the WIN.INI file, and ensure the SHELL= entry in the SYSTEM.INI
file is loading PROGMAN.EXE. Also, make sure the SYSTEM.INI file does not
include third-party virtual device drivers (VxDs) or other third-party
Windows components.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Before Clean Booting</h3>
 
<P>
Create a bootable floppy disk that contains the MS-DOS system files
and any other files that are required to make the system operational,
such as disk-compression utilities (for example, Stacker), disk
partitioning drivers (for example, Disk Manager), and other third-party
device drivers.
<P>
<P><h3>To Clean Boot Before Running Windows 3.1 Setup</h3>
 
<P>
If there is no disk compression software, disk partitioning software,
or other third-party drivers necessary to boot the computer, the
machine can be booted on a floppy disk that contains only the MS-DOS
system files, without a CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
If there is disk partitioning, disk compression, or other third-party
software required to boot the computer, the startup files on the disk
created above should appear as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   CONFIG.SYS                              AUTOEXEC.BAT
   ----------                              ------------

   FILES=45                                PROMPT $P$G
   BUFFERS=20
   &lt;Third-party disk partitioner&gt;
   &lt;Third-party disk compression driver&gt;
   &lt;Other third-party driver&gt;

</PRE>AFTER Windows 3.1 is installed, a clean boot should appear as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   CONFIG.SYS                              AUTOEXEC.BAT
   ----------                              ------------
   FILES=45                                PROMPT $P$G
   BUFFERS=20                              PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\DOS;C:\
   DEVICE=C:\&lt;dir&gt;\HIMEM.SYS               SET TEMP=C:\&lt;valid path&gt;
   &lt;Third-party disk partitioner&gt;
   &lt;Third-party disk compression driver&gt;
   &lt;Other third-party drivers&gt;
   STACKS=9,256
   SHELL=C:\&lt;valid path&gt;\COMMAND.COM  /E:1024 /P

</PRE><h3>Exceptions</h3>
 
<P>
The following are examples of drivers that SHOULD NOT be removed; they
are used when the computer is turned on to make the hard drive
accessible. This is not a complete list, but it does include most of
the commonly used drivers:
<P>
<PRE>   Hard Disk Drivers:          SQY55.SYS, SSTBIO.SYS, SSTDRIVE.SYS,
                               AH1544.SYS, ILIM386.SYS, ASPI4DOS.SYS,
                               SCSIHA.SYS, SCSIDSK.EXE, SKYDRVI.SYS,
                               ATDOSXL.SYS, NONSTD.SYS

   Disk Partitioners:          DMDRVR.BIN, SSTOR.SYS, HARDRIVE.SYS,
                               EDVR.SYS, FIXT_DRV.SYS, LDRIVE.SYS,
                               ENHDISK.SYS

   Disk Compression Utilities: STACKER.COM, SSWAP.COM, SSTOR.EXE,
                               DEVSWAP.COM

</PRE>If the purpose of a device driver or program is unknown, DO NOT remove
it. Most device drivers and programs will display a message describing
their purpose when they are initialized.
<P>
A clean boot DOES NOT include:

<UL><LI>DOS=HIGH,UMB
<LI>EMM386.EXE
<LI>INSTALL=SHARE.EXE
<LI>INSTALL=FASTOPEN.EXE
<LI>Third-party memory managers
<LI>RAM disk devices
