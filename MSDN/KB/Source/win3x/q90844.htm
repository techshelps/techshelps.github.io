</PRE><h3>Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet Driver (HPPCL.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>

<PRE>           uploaded in the WDL to correct the duplexing problem on the
           LaserJet IID and the page-feed problem on the 500+ printer
           with 512K RAM.

</PRE>10/08/92 - This file has been updated with version 3.1.2 of the

              international WDL.

            - Epson models. EPL-7000, EPL-6000, and GQ-3500 have been
              removed from the driver. The EPL-7000 is covered by the
              WDL driver EPLAZER.DRV. The other Epson models will be
              added to the EPLAZER.DRV driver.

<PRE>           for the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet III, IIID, IIIP, and IIISi
           printers is an update to the one previously provided on the
           WDL and is an update to the version included in Windows for
           Workgroups. It corrects the following problems:

            - When installing to upgrade over HPPCL5A.DRV, the
              LaserJet III could not be installed if the IIIP, IIID,
              IIISi, or IIISi PostScript drivers were already
              installed.

            - A general protection (GP) fault occurs when installing
              any model except the LaserJet III on 286-based
              computers.

            - Support for the envelope tray has been enabled for the
              III and IIIP models.

</PRE>10/08/92 - HPPCL5.EXE IS NEW TO THE WDL. This version of the Microsoft

           originally included in the Windows 3.1 package. This driver
           is included with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups. It
           corrects the following problems:

            - Not maintaining separate driver settings for the same
              printer installed on different ports. Previously, if an
              HP LaserJet III (for example) was installed on both LPT1
              and LPT2, changing any settings of the one installed on
              LPT1 would also be applied to the one on LPT2.

            - Rotated fonts not printing in some cases.

            - Loss of data when printing multiple jobs to the same
              port at the same time.
