The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If an Intel EtherExpress 16 is installed on a machine and there is a
hardware conflict, such as an I/O Port address or an interrupt request
line (IRQ) being duplicated on two devices, the following error
message may occur during startup:
<P>
<PRE>   Failure: EtherExpress 16 Hardware Not Found, Driver not loaded.
   Failure: NDIS environment invalid, Driver not loaded.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Because the Intel EtherExpress 16 is a software-configured network card,
the only workaround to this error message is to put the card into another
machine and use the following steps to reconfigure it.
<P>
NOTE: This message may occur if the network card isn't seated properly
in the machine. Check to be sure that this isn't the problem before
reconfiguring the card as discussed below.

<OL><P><LI>On the first machine, load Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>Run Control Panel.

<P><LI>In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon.

<P><LI>Choose the Adapters option to remove the driver for the Intel
    EtherExpress 16 network card.

<P><LI>When prompted to Restart Computer or Continue, choose Continue, then
    exit Windows and turn off the machine.

<P><LI>Remove the Intel card from the first machine, turn off a second machine
    which doesn't have a hardware conflict, remove any network cards from
    the second machine, and place the Intel card into the second machine.

<P><LI>Turn on the second machine and load Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>Run Control Panel.

<P><LI>In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon, and choose the
    Adapters option to remove any other network card drivers and install
    the driver for the Intel EtherExpress 16.

<P><LI>Change either the I/O Port address or the IRQ to an unused value on the
    first machine.

<P><LI>When prompted to Restart Computer or Continue, choose Restart Computer
    and then let the machine restart. Once it has restarted, turn the
    second machine off and remove the Intel card.

<P><LI>Place the card back into the first machine, turn it on, and load
    Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>Run Control Panel.

<P><LI>In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon and choose the
    Adapters option to add the driver for the Intel EtherExpress 16. Use
    Setup to configure it for the new settings, which were set up on the
    second machine.

<P><LI>When prompted to Restart Computer or Continue, choose Restart
    Computer and then let the machine restart. The error message should
    no longer occur and Windows for Workgroups should operate normally.

<P><LI>If the error message still occurs, there may still be a hardware
    conflict and the above steps should be repeated until it is resolved.
<P>
</OL>The Intel EtherExpress 16 network interface card is set up exclusively
with software, either with Windows for Workgroups or Intel's Softset
utility. If there is a hardware conflict, the options changed by the
Setup software are never written to the card because the software
can't communicate with it due to the I/O Port address or IRQ conflict.
Because there is no other way to adjust the hardware settings on the
Intel EtherExpress 16, it has to be configured in another machine and
then moved back to the original machine.
