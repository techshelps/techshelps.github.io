The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Workgroup Connections version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If the Windows for Workgroups network card device drivers load
correctly when you start your computer, but you cannot see the network
when you start Windows for Workgroups or Workgroup Connections, your
network card is probably improperly configured.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Most network cards have multiple transceiver options. These correspond
to the connectors on the back of the card (BNC, AUI, TP, or twisted
pair, and so on). Make sure the network card is configured to use the
connector on the back of the card to which the network cable is
attached.
<P>
There are several common ways to configure the connector for a net
card. Your connector probably uses ONE of the following:

<UL><LI>Jumpers on the card itself. You will need the documentation that
   came with the network card in order to set the jumper to the
   correct position.

<LI>Software configurable. These network cards can be configured by
   running a program, that comes with the card and will allow you to
   change the settings.

<LI>Set by Parameters in the PROTOCOL.INI file. This is similar to
   software configurable. These settings can be changed with the
   Windows for Workgroups or Workgroup Connections Setup programs.
<P>
</UL>For a more detailed description of connector types (BNC, AUI, TP, and
so on), please see the Windows for Workgroups installation
documentation.
<P>
Some other possible causes for this problem:

<UL><LI>There is an interrupt conflict. Try putting the net card on a
   different interrupt.

<LI>The network cable is not plugged in to the net card or is loose.

<LI>The network cable is faulty.

<LI>The network card is not functioning properly. This can be caused by
   a conflict between the net card and some other device in the system.

<LI>The network card driver is not functioning properly. Make sure you
   are using the correct version of the network card driver (the one
   that comes with Windows for Workgroups or Workgroup Connections).
   Some network cards come with a disk containing NDIS Network drivers;
   these may not work correctly.
