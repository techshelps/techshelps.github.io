The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If a shell other than Program Manager (PROGMAN.EXE) is specified on
the SHELL= line in the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, programs
in the Windows 3.1 StartUp group may not run. Also, any applications
listed on the LOAD= and RUN= lines may not run with Windows 3.0 and
3.1, depending on the shell.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>LOAD and RUN= Lines</h3>
 
<P>
When you start Windows, Program Manager looks at the LOAD= and RUN=
lines for programs to run at startup. Third-party shells may not read
these line. For information on compatibility and functionality with
LOAD= and RUN= lines, contact the product vendor.
<P>
Note: Norton Desktop for Windows (NDW) does read these lines and loads
programs on the LOAD= and RUN= lines.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows StartUp Group and Norton Desktop for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
If you install Norton Desktop for Windows over Windows 3.1, none of
the applications in the StartUp group run when you start Windows.
Although NDW converts the group to its shell, it does not transfer the
applications in the StartUp group to its autostart group. You must
transfer the StartUp group to the autostart group that NDW creates.
<P>
<P><h3>UAE with Excel for Windows or Word for Windows as Shell</h3>
 
<P>
In Windows 3.0, if you use Microsoft Excel for Windows or Microsoft
Word for Windows as the shell, an Unrecoverable Application Error
(UAE) is generated.
<P>
In Windows 3.1, most Microsoft applications can be loaded as a shell
without problems. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Project are examples of
Microsoft programs that can be loaded as a shell but do not recognize
the Load= and Run= lines or the StartUp group.
<P>
Currently, Program Manager, File Manager, and the Windows 3.0 MS-DOS
Executive are the only Microsoft programs created for Windows that
recognize the Load= and Run= functions. In Windows 3.1, the StartUp
group is also ignored because it is also run only by the default
Windows Program Manager.
<P>
Norton Desktop for Windows is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
