<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the entries that the PC-Speaker driver for
Microsoft Windows version 3.1 makes in the SYSTEM.INI and what they
mean. The following are the default entries:
<P>
<PRE>   [drivers]
   Wave=speaker.drv

   [Speaker.drv]
   CpuSpeed=28
   Volume=500
   Version=774
   Enhanced=1
   MaxSeconds=3
   LeaveInterruptsEnabled=0

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: This driver can be manually installed into Windows. Query on the
following here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for more information:
<P>
<PRE>   pc-speaker and driver and setup and initializes

</PRE><h3>CpuSpeed</h3>
 
<P>
This indicates the setting for speaker speed (5-300). Changing this
setting slows down or speeds up the play back of the wave file, and is
similar to setting the speeds on a record turntable. This setting can
be changed by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>Run Control Panel.

<P><LI>Choose the Drivers icon, and select the Wave Driver For PC-Speaker
   driver.

<P><LI>Make any necessary changes and then choose OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Volume</h3>
 
<P>
This indicates the volume level for the speaker. This setting can be
adjusted through the Control Panel as described above.
<P>
<P><h3>Version</h3>
 
<P>
This indicates the version number of the speaker driver.
<P>
<P><h3>Enhanced</h3>
 
<P>
This indicates whether Windows is running in 386 enhanced mode or not.
The value is changed when Windows is run in 386 enhanced mode (1), or
in standard mode (0).
<P>
<P><h3>MaxSeconds</h3>
 
<P>
This indicates the maximum number of seconds a wave file will play
(1-10, none). When set to "none" the maximum becomes a combination of
the wave file size and system memory. This setting can be adjusted
through the Control Panel as described above.
<P>
<P><h3>LeaveInterruptsEnabled</h3>
 
<P>
When this is set to 1, it allows the mouse and other interrupt
sensitive devices to function while a wave file is playing. If left at
the default, 0, it will not allow these devices to function. This
setting can be adjusted through the Control Panel as described above.
<P>
The PC-Speaker driver is available on the Microsoft Download Service
by dialing (425) 936-6735. The file is SPEAK.EXE and is also contained
on the Windows Driver Library (WDL).
<P>
For a complete listing of the WDL's contents and instructions for
obtaining the WDL, query on "<B><A HREF="../WIN3X/Q82006.htm">Q82006</A></B>" in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
