          Questions and Answers: Using a Mouse with Windows 3.0
          -----------------------------------------------------

1. Q. I am using a Microsoft Mouse. I see a pointer when Windows
      starts  up but I can't make the pointer move. What is wrong?

   A. If there is a pointer, Windows thinks it has found a mouse.
      There are two situations that can cause Windows to incorrectly
      detect a mouse so that you get an on-screen pointer but can't
      move it:

      a. Windows Setup may have detected an unused mouse port. If your
         computer has a built-in mouse port that is not being used,
         contact your dealer or manufacture for instructions on how to
         disable this port.

      b. Windows may be mistakenly identifying other hardware in your
         computer as a mouse (for example, a card for a scanner,
         modem, or network). If you are using a serial mouse on COM 1
         and a modem on COM 2, just switching this setup may resolve
         the problem. There is another solution if you are using the
         Microsoft Mouse driver version 8.0 or later. You can place an
         entry in the MOUSE.INI file that will tell the new mouse
         software exactly where your mouse is located:

         1) Start Windows Notepad and open the MOUSE.INI file in the
            MOUSE directory.

         2) Find the line that begins "MouseType=" and edit it to
            read:

               MouseType=SerialPort1

         3) Save your edited MOUSE.INI file and reboot your computer.

         If you want to upgrade to the newest version of the software
         for your Microsoft Mouse, call Microsoft Customer Service at
         (800) 426-9400.

2. Q. I am using a mouse that is not a Microsoft Mouse, and I'm having
      trouble with it. What should I do?

   A. Contact the manufacturer of your mouse to confirm that you are
      using the correct version of its mouse software for Windows 3.0,
      and that the mouse is installed correctly. Please do this first.
      The best source of support for using your mouse with Windows is
      the mouse manufacturer. If that doesn't resolve your problem,
      call Microsoft Product Support.
