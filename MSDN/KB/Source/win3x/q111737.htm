The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
Microsoft cannot guarantee this procedure will work in every situation. If
this procedure fails, you must reinstall Windows 3.1 and Windows-based
applications to a new directory.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, it may be possible
to restore your installation of Microsoft Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This procedure can be used only if you ran Windows for Workgroups Setup
once. If you ran Setup more than once, it is not possible to restore the
original Windows configuration files; therefore, Windows 3.1 must be
reinstalled to an empty directory. Also, any third-party software that
replaces Windows virtual device drivers (VxDs) may need to be reinstalled
after you reinstall Windows 3.1.
<P>
If you did run Windows for Workgroups Setup one time only, and you want to
restore your Windows 3.1 installation, follow the steps below.

<OL><P><LI>Start your machine with MS-DOS.

<P><LI>Edit the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to remove the Windows for
    Workgroups 3.11 IFSHLP.SYS and NET START lines. For example, remove
    "device=c:\windows\ifshlp.sys" from the CONFIG.SYS file and
    "c:\windows\net start" from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<P><LI>Copy the WININI.W31 and SYSINI.W31 files from the Windows directory to
    a floppy disk.

<P><LI>Run Windows version 3.1 Setup and choose Custom Setup. A message then
    appears stating that Setup has found a previous version of Microsoft
    Windows on your system and recommends that you perform an upgrade.
    Specify the Windows for Workgroups directory as the target directory
    and press ENTER. When the System Information screen appears, change the
    "Network = Microsoft Windows Network (version 3.11)" entry to:
<P>
       Network = No Network Installed &lt;or the specific network in use&gt;

<P><LI>The Windows 3.1 Setup program detects some newer drivers (for
    example, COMM.DRV) and prompts you to replace them with the Windows
    3.1 drivers. Press the ESC key to replace each file with the older
    version of the file.

<P><LI>After Setup loads Windows, it begins to copy files to your system.
    Setup again finds newer versions than those provided with Windows 3.1.
    Setup prompts you to keep or replace each file. Replace each file by
    choosing Yes when prompted.
<P>
    Setup finds version conflicts for the following files:
<P>
<PRE>       SYSEDIT.EXE   DDEML.DLL    OLECLI.DLL  MAIN.CPL     TOOLHELP.DLL
       PRINTMAN.EXE  WINFILE.EXE  SHELL.DLL   COMMDLG.DLL  CLIPBRD.EXE
       WINOA386.MOD

</PRE><P><LI>From the floppy disk used in step 3, copy the WININI.W31 file to the
    Windows directory as WIN.INI and the SYSINI.W31 file to the Windows
    directory as SYSTEM.INI. For example, if your Windows directory is
    C:\WINDOWS and the floppy disk is in drive A, type the following two
    commands at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER after each line:
<P>
       copy a:winini.w31 c:\windows\win.ini
       copy a:sysini.w31 c:\windows\system.ini

<P><LI>Reboot your computer and start Windows 3.1 by typing "win" (without the
    quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then pressing ENTER.

<P><LI>Remove the program icons that were added by the Windows for Workgroups
    Setup program. To do so:
<P>
    a. Delete the following icon from the Main group:
<P>
<PRE>          Clipbook Viewer

    b. Delete the Network group.

    c. Delete the Hearts icon from the Games group.

</PRE><P><LI>Remove the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 files below from the Windows
    directory and Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>

    FAXCODEC.DLL    FAXCOVER.DLL     FAXMGR.EXE     FAXEPT.DLL

    FAXSTUB.DLL     FRAMEWRK.DLL     IFSMGR.386     IOS.386
    LM21DRV.UPD     LMSCRIPT.EXE     LMSCRIPT.PIF   LPT.386
    MAILMGR.DLL     MAILSPL.EXE      MAPI.DLL       MSSFS.DLL

    NETBEUI.386     NETWORK.INF      NWLINK.386     NWNBLINK.386
    PABNSP.DLL      RMM.D32          SCONFIG.DLL    SENDFILE.DLL

    VCACHE.386      VCOMM.386        VFAT.386       VFORMS.DLL
    VNETSUP.386     VPMTD.386        VREDIR.386     VSERVER.386
    VSHARE.386      VXDLDR.386       WFWAUDIT.386   WFWNET.DRV
    WFWSETUP.DLL    WINNET.INF

    NOTE: The file DECLAN.386 in the list above is the 386 enhanced mode
    version of the network interface card (NIC) referenced in the section
    above. The NIC driver for your particular network card may be
    different.

</PRE><P><LI>Quit and then restart Windows.

<P><LI>Correct the Windows Setup icon command line.
<P>
    a. From the Program Manager Main group, select Windows Setup
       either by using the keyboard or by clicking the icon once (do not
       double-click the Setup icon).
<P>
    b. From the File menu, choose Properties.
<P>
    c. Change the Command Line entry from WINSETUP.EXE to SETUP.EXE.
<P>
    d. Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>After you follow these steps, Windows 3.1 should be successfully
reinstalled. However, if Windows 3.1 does not perform as expected (for
example, you receive error messages or the system stops responding
[hangs]), you must reinstall Windows 3.1 and all Windows-based software to
a new directory.
