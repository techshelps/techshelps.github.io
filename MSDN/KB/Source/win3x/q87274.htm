The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The [RenFiles] section of the SETUP.INF file is used to rename files
located in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory during the upgrade from
Windows 3.0 to Windows 3.1. Renaming these files will prevent them
from being overwritten during the Windows 3.1 setup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The default [RenFiles] section of the SETUP.INF file on upgrade
disk no. 1 is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   [RenFiles]
      MIDIMAP.CFG,MIDIMAP.OLD
      ADLIB.DRV,MSADLIB.DRV

</PRE>The first file in a line (for example, MIDIMAP.CFG) is the file that
already exists in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory; the second file
(for example, MIDIMAP.OLD) is the name that the first file will be
renamed to.
<P>
NOTE: Files not in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory will not be
renamed unless the full path to that file is given.
<P>
To rename files in a directory other than the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory,
you must first change directories. The change is made by using two periods
(..) to move down one directory or one period to move up a directory. Also,
the change must be in relation to the directory that you are currently
logged to. For example, if you want to rename the following files
<P>
<PRE>   [drive:]\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\BLUE.TXT
   [drive:]\WINDOWS\WHITE.TXT
   [drive:]\WINDOWS\YELLOW.TXT
   [drive:]\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\GREEN.TXT
   [drive:]\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\BLACK.TXT

   ([drive:] refers to the drive where the Windows files are located)

</PRE>add the following lines to the [RenFiles] section of the SETUP.INF,
respectively:
<P>
<PRE>   [RenFiles]
   BLUE.TXT,RED.TXT
   ..\WHITE.TXT,PURPLE.TXT
   YELLOW.TXT,CYAN.TXT
   .\SYSTEM\GREEN.TXT,TAN.TXT
   BLACK.TXT,ORANGE.TXT
