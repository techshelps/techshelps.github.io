</PRE>07/17/92 - This version (2.0) of the Microsoft Windows Panasonic
<PRE>           24-pin printer driver is an update to the one
           provided in the Windows 3.1 package (version 1.0). It
           corrects the following problems:

            - Some extended characters do not map to the correct
              Windows ANSI character set
            - Some extended characters use incorrect character widths
              for proportionally spaced fonts
            - A3, 11-by-17-inches, and fanfold 14 7/8-by-11-inches
              paper sizes added
            - User-defined paper sizes not functioning correctly.

              and the Panasonic KX-P2624
            - Provides a way for users to adjust where the driver
              should expect the unprintable regions to occur. This is
              accessed through the Options Margins dialog box. The
              default values are provided as specified by the
              manufacturer.

</PRE><h3>PostScript Driver - PSCRIPT.DRV (PSCRIP.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
11/04/93 - This version (3.58) updates version 3.56. It contains a fix
<PRE>           for the ResetDC() general protection (GP) fault problem that
           occurs when a large number of TrueType fonts are installed. It
           also contains a fix to stop requests for printing 16dpp DIB
           images, rather than generating incorrect data as the previous
           driver does.

</PRE>07/01/93 - This version (3.56) of the Microsoft Windows
<PRE>           PostScript driver is an update to the one previously
           provided (version 3.55) in the WDL. It is the same as
           version 3.55 except for the addition of new escapes
           specifically for Aldus PageMaker 5.0.

</PRE>12/09/92 - This version (3.55) of the Microsoft Windows printer driver
<PRE>           for PostScript printers is an update to the driver previously
           provided in the WDL. This release of PSCRIPT.DRV includes all
           the changes that were in version 3.53 (the last version released
           on the WDL), version 3.54 (the version of the PostScript driver
           that was released with the Microsoft TrueType Font Pack 2 [see
           below]), as well as the following change:

            - Corrects problems printing extended characters from non-ANSI
              fonts on TrueImage printers.

          Version 3.54 of the Microsoft Windows printer driver for
          PostScript printers was only released as part of the Microsoft
          TrueType Font Pack 2. Version 3.54 of PSCRIPT.DRV corrects the
          following problems:

            - Corrects problems with following LaserMaster products:

                 LaserMaster WinPrinter 800, versions 1.0 and 1.5
                 LaserMaster WinJet 800, versions 1.0 and 1.5
                 LaserMaster WinJet 300, version 1.0

            - Corrects problems printing some complex TrueType fonts as
              Type 1 fonts, such as "Augsberger Initials" from the
              Microsoft TrueType Font Pack 2.

            - Corrects problems in tracking PostScript virtual memory that
              would cause some older PostScript printers to reset during a
              print job.

</PRE>08/12/92 - THE DRIVER HAS NOT CHANGED. A label in the code was
<PRE>           changed. You do not need to download the 8/12/92 version.

</PRE>07/17/92 - This version (3.53) of the Microsoft Windows PostScript
<PRE>           driver is an update to the one previously provided in the
           WDL (version 3.52). It corrects the problem introduced in
           the 3.52 version with PostScript errors occurring with the
           "setresolution" command on IBM PostScript printers other than
           the IBM 4029.

</PRE>06/25/92 - This version (3.52) of the Microsoft Windows PostScript driver
<PRE>           is an update to the version provided in the Windows 3.1 package
           (3.5) and the version previously provided with the WDL (3.51).
            It corrects the following problems:

            - 600 dpi resolution not functioning with IBM 4029 in
              PostScript mode
            - Certain files generating PostScript errors for an "arcto"
              command from various applications.
            - System resource loss with applications using the ResetDC
              call, such as Microsoft Word version 2.0 for Windows.
            - Performance loss when many soft fonts are installed.
            - Downloading TrueType fonts as native TrueType fonts
              mapping extended characters incorrectly.
            - Error handler not downloaded when minimal PostScript
              header is requested by CorelDRAW.
            - GP fault in PSCRIPT.DRV with Harvard Graphics for
              Windows when requesting KernPairs information from
              driver.
            - Workaround available for envelopes printing upside down.
              Add envelopeOrient=270 under the [Printername, port] section
              of the WIN.INI file. Functionally equivalent to
              LandscapeOrient=270, as described in section 4.7 of the
              PRINTERS.WRI file.
            - Four new Escape commands available to applications
              capable of generating their own PostScript output.
              Details on these commands are available in the Windows
              SDK/DDK portion of the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
            - EPS files created by the PostScript driver (selected in
              the Options Dialog box) are no longer rotated based on
              currently selected orientation.
            - Various Linotype typesetter problems described below:

               - Support for Linotype 100, 300, and 500 added
               - Support for "basic 35" PostScript fonts added
               - Problems with "Extra" paper sizes (for example,
                 "Letter Extra," "Legal Extra," and so on) corrected.

               - Various "Transverse" and "Extra Transverse" paper sizes
                 added.
               - Extra graphics resolutions added as follows:

                    Linotype 100          1270 dpi
