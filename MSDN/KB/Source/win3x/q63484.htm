The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows-based portion of the Windows 3.0 Setup program does
not support the installation of third-party display, keyboard, mouse, or
network drivers. To install a third-party driver, it is necessary to use
one of two methods below, depending on how the third-party driver
manufacturer has supplied the drivers to you.
<P>
This information does not apply to third-party printer drivers. Third-party
printer drivers may be installed with the Windows Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Using the MS-DOS Portion of Setup</h3>
 
<P>
If the third-party driver(s) are supplied on a disk that contains an
OEMSETUP.INF file, they may be installed through the MS-DOS portion of
Setup. Exit Windows to the MS-DOS command prompt, and run Setup from the
Windows 3.0 directory. Since Windows 3.0 is already installed, the MS-DOS
Setup program goes into maintenance mode and does not require you to
reinstall Windows.
<P>
At this point, override the default detection for the type of driver you
are installing (that is, display, keyboard, mouse, or network). Then choose
"Other - Requires Disk Provided by Hardware Manufacturer." Setup then
prompts you to insert the driver disk and installs the drivers.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Manually with SYSTEM.INI</h3>
 
<P>
If the third-party driver(s) are supplied without an OEMSETUP.INF
file, they must be installed by manually editing the SYSTEM.INI file.
Instructions for the necessary modifications should be provided to you
along with the third-party driver(s). If not, contact the driver
manufacturer for assistance.
