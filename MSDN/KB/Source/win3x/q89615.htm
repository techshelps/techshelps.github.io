The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Hauppauge Win/TV video system with Windows, you may
notice the following limitations:

<UL><LI>The color magenta (purple with red) does not display correctly.
   This is a limitation of the Hauppauge video, and may apply to
   other television video boards also.

<LI>You may experience problems loading and saving still-frame
   pictures.

<LI>You may experience difficulty using WinTV with Microsoft Video for
   Windows.
<P>
</UL>In addition, the 16,000,000 color mode that some video adapters
support will not work with WinTV.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Win/TV is a combination hardware/software system that allows Windows
users to view full-motion video and television in a resizable window.
Win/TV also allows Windows users to capture screens and save them in a
variety of graphic file formats (for example, BMP, GIF, PCX, MMP).
<P>
In order to use Microsoft Video for Windows, the WinTV card and
software must be revision 'D' or later. To upgrade the card, you must
return it to the factory so that the IRQ can be reset to IRQ 15.
<P>
<P><h3>Magenta Displays Incorrectly</h3>
 
<P>
The magenta display problem occurs because the Win/TV system uses a
technique called "color keying" to mix the computer's standard video
signal with a television signal generated by the Win/TV hardware.
<P>
The color keying process does not actually send the television signal
through Windows. Rather, the Win/TV software fills its on-screen
window (the display area) with a solid block of magenta and sends the
location of the display area to the Win/TV hardware.
<P>
When the video signal is sent out from the computer's video adapter,
the Win/TV hardware superimposes its television signal over any
occurrence of magenta that lies within the bounds of the display area.
Under normal circumstances, this allows other windows to be displayed
on top of the Win/TV window.
<P>
<P><h3>Problems Loading/Saving Still-Frame Pictures</h3>
 
<P>
If a computer has 16 megabytes (MB) of RAM installed, the user should
upgrade to WinTV version 2.03 or later. This solves the problem of
loading and saving still-frame pictures. The current versions of WinTV
can save and load still-frame pictures while Windows is in 386
enhanced mode only. This is by design.
<P>
<P><h3>Using WinTV with Microsoft Video for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
To use Microsoft Video for Windows, the WinTV card and software must
be revision 'D' or later. To upgrade the card, you must return it to
the factory so that the IRQ can be reset to IRQ 15.
