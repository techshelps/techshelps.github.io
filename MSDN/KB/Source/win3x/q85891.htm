<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are running Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and the File menu is
missing, or an option normally available under a Program Manager menu
is unavailable (dimmed) or missing, then either the PROGMAN.INI file or
selected group files (.GRP) have been modified.
<P>
For more information on modifying the PROGMAN.INI file, refer to pages 219-
221 in the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" manual for version 3.1.
<P>
The following is a list of disabled options and the procedure used to
disable them. These changes are normally made by the system administrator
of the network to have more control of the Windows environment.
