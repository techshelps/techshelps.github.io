The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a WinPopup message is sent to a workgroup, everyone in that workgroup
may receive the message multiple times. The number of times the message is
received is dependent on what protocol(s) the sending machine is using.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following behavior has been reported:

<UL><LI>If you use only the NetBEUI protocol on the sending workstation,
   members of the workgroup receive one message.

<LI>If you use only the IPX/SPX Compatible Transport on the sending
   workstation, members of the workgroup receive one message.

<LI>If you use only the IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with NetBIOS on
   the sending computer, members of the workgroup receive two messages.

<LI>If you use the NetBEUI protocol and the IPX/SPX Compatible Transport
   on the sending machine, members of the workgroup receive two messages.

<LI>If you use the NetBEUI protocol and the IPX/SPX Compatible Transport
   with NetBIOS on the sending workstation, members of the workgroup
   receive three messages.

<LI>If you use the NetBEUI protocol and TCP/IP on the sending machine,
   members of the workgroup receive three messages.

<LI>If you use the NetBEUI, IPX/SPX Compatible Transport, and TCP/IP on the
   sending workstation, members of the workgroup receive four messages.
