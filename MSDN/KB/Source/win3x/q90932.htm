The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups may not start in 386 enhanced mode if the PC Tools
VxD VDMAD.386 file is present in either the WINDOWS or WINDOWS\SYSTEM
directory.
<P>
To correct this problem, remove the PC Tools VDMAD.386 file and expand
the Windows for Workgroups VDMAD.386 file from the original disks.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups and PC Tools version 7.x use a VxD called
VDMAD.386. This file should reside in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
This file is referenced in the SYSTEM.INI file's [386Enh] section on
the line:
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=VDMAD.386

</PRE>The Windows for Workgroups VxD can be identified by its date, which
should be 10/01/92, and its file size, which should be 12246 bytes.
<P>
When PC Tools version 7.x is installed after Windows for Workgroups,
the PC Tools installation may overwrite the Windows for Workgroups VxD
file VDMAD.386 with the PC Tools VxD file VDMAD.386. If this is the
case, delete or rename the VDMAD.386 file in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
directory and expand the Windows for Workgroups VDMAD.386 file from
the original disks.
<P>
If the PC Tools VxD VDMAD.386 file is located in the WINDOWS
directory, Windows for Workgroups may load this file instead of the
correct Windows for Workgroups VxD from the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
If this is the case, first verify that the correct VDMAD.386 file is
located in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory (by checking the date), and
then delete or rename the VDMAD.386 located in the WINDOWS directory.
<P>
PC Tools is manufactured by Central Point Software, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.
