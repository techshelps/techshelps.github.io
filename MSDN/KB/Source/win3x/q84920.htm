The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When upgrading a shared network installation (using the SETUP /N command)
from Microsoft Windows version 3.0 to Microsoft Windows version 3.1, the
Windows 3.0 files contained in the shared directory must be removed
completely and replaced with files from Windows 3.1 before performing the
upgrade for the Windows user directories.
<P>
The Windows 3.1 SETUP /N command can only be used to upgrade Windows 3.0
user directories if the directories were originally created using the SETUP
/N command from the Windows 3.0 program.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Perform the following steps to correctly upgrade a Windows 3.0 shared
network to Windows 3.1:

<OL><P><LI>All users on the network exit from Windows.

<P><LI>Log onto the network as supervisor.

<P><LI>Remove all the read-only attributes on the Windows 3.0 files in the
   shared directory using the MS-DOS ATTRIB command or Novell FLAG
   command. (The shared directory was created using steps 1-9 on page
   553 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0, and
   should contain between 282-286 files.)
<P>
   From the Windows Shared Directory MS-DOS Prompt, type the following
   command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      attrib -r *.*
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      flag *.* rw
</PRE><P>
   Note: The flag *.* rw command is for Novell users only.

<P><LI>If no third-party applications, DLLs, or drivers have been
   installed (for example PC Tools, Norton Desktop, drivers from OEMs
   or the SDL), and their files do not reside in the same shared
   directory as Windows 3.0:
<P>
   a. Delete the Windows 3.0 files.
<P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
   b. Move the Windows 3.0 files to a new location. (If these files
<P><PRE>      are moved, make sure they are not placed in a directory that is
      in the path or on a Novell search drive.)
</PRE><P>
   If ANY third-party applications, DLLs or drivers have been
   installed (PC Tools, Norton Desktop, drivers from OEMs or the SDL)
   and their files reside in the same shared directory, perform the
   following procedure to remove only those files that were provided
   by Windows 3.0:
<P>
   a. Place the Windows 3.0 Disk 1 in a floppy drive.
<P>
   b. Make the floppy drive the current MS-DOS drive.
<P>
   c. At the floppy drive MS-DOS command line, enter the following
<P><PRE>      MS-DOS command
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         FOR %A IN (*.*) DO DEL x:\path\%A

     where "x:\path" is the network drive and path to the Windows 3.0
     shared directory.

  d. Repeat steps a-c above for each of the original Windows 3.0
     floppy disks.

   NOTE: In a small number of cases, third-party display drivers will
   either be using the 386grabber (*.gr3) and 286grabber (*.gr2) files
   supplied by Windows 3.0 or replacing the Windows 3.0 grabber files
   with their own and using the same filename. In these cases, Windows
   3.1 Setup will not update the SYSTEM.INI file for the Windows 3.1
   grabber files (*.3gr and *.2gr) and you will get errors upon
   loading Windows 3.1 after upgrading the user if you delete these
   files. To be absolutely safe, copy the *.gr2 and *.gr3 files in the
   shared Windows directory to a floppy or separate directory before
   performing the above procedure, and copy them back if needed.

</PRE><P><LI>Follow the instruction on page 9 of the "Microsoft Windows Getting
   Started" guide for version 3.1 to place the Windows 3.1 files into
   a clean Windows shared directory by executing the following
   command:
<P>
<PRE>        SETUP /A

   NOTE: If you have a network requiring a workstation driver update
   for Windows 3.1, you may want to upgrade the workstation network
   software before completing the next step. For example, Novell users
   should update the IPX to 3.1 and NETX to 3.26 or IPXODI to 1.2 and
   LSL to 1.21.

</PRE><P><LI>Have each user follow the instructions on page 8 of the "Microsoft
   Windows Getting Started" guide for version 3.1 to upgrade the
   Windows user files to Windows 3.1. When prompted for the directory
   to install to, specify the location of the existing Windows 3.0
   user directory. (User directories generally have less than 20 files
   in them and do not have a subdirectory called SYSTEM.) This will
   upgrade all necessary files and Windows 3.1 will now be
   operational.
<P>
</OL>For additional information on setting up Windows on a network, see
pages 6-9 of the "Microsoft Windows Getting Started" guide for version
3.1, pages 71-74 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit," and
the NETWORKS.WRI file in the Windows 3.1 directory.
