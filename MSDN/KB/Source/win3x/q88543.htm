The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses troubleshooting the Microsoft Mouse and Microsoft-
compatible mice in Microsoft Windows and Windows for Workgroups. This
article has the following two sections:

<UL><LI>Mouse Does Not Function in Windows
<LI>Mouse Pointer Movement Is Erratic
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before troubleshooting, determine the following:

<UL><LI>Is it a Microsoft Mouse or a Microsoft-compatible mouse?
   NOTE: A "Microsoft-compatible" mouse is not a Microsoft Mouse.

<LI>How is the mouse connected to the machine? Is it a bus mouse,
   PS/2-style mouse, or a serial mouse?

<LI>If it is a serial mouse, to which COM port is it connected?

<LI>Some BIOS problems result in a non-functioning serial mouse in Windows
   (usually on COM2) and can be resolved by a BIOS upgrade. You may want
   to check the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit for version 3.1 to see if
   your system BIOS could be the problem.
<P>
</UL><h3>Mouse Does Not Function in Windows</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Load the MS-DOS Mouse driver to enable the use of a mouse in
   MS-DOS-based applications.
<P>
   If you are having problems using the mouse in MS-DOS-based
   applications under Windows, make sure the mouse functions in your
   MS-DOS-based application before starting Windows. If it does not,
   then the mouse probably won't function in an MS-DOS-based application
   running inside of Windows. Consult your mouse manufacturer for
   assistance configuring the mouse so it will run in MS-DOS-based
   applications outside of Windows.
<P>
   If you are using a Microsoft mouse, you can test this by running
   MOUSE.COM and then running an application that uses the mouse such as
   the MS-DOS 5.0 Edit program or MS-DOS Shell.
<P>
   Version 8.2 of the mouse driver should be used if you are using a
   Microsoft Mouse. This driver comes with Windows 3.1. If you do not
   have the correct MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS file on your hard disk drive,
   expand MOUSE.SY_ and MOUSE.CO_ from the Windows disks to the hard
   disk drive as MOUSE.SYS and MOUSE.COM. For more information about
   expanding files, refer to page 61 of the "Getting Started with Microsoft
   Windows" manual for version 3.1.

<P><LI>Make sure the correct Windows mouse driver was installed.
<P>
   To determine if the correct mouse driver was installed during Setup,
   exit Windows, change to the C:\WINDOWS directory and type "setup"
   (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt. If "No
   mouse or other pointing device" or an incorrect mouse is selected,
   select the "Microsoft, or IBM PS/2" option.
<P>
   Some "Microsoft-compatible" mice are more compatible with the Mouse
   Systems driver or another mouse driver listed in Setup. It may be
   necessary to try other mouse driver selections. Some "compatible"
   mice may come with a driver disk that contains both Windows and MS-
   DOS mouse drivers. These should be tried in place of the Microsoft
   drivers.
<P>
   NOTE: The MS-DOS- and Windows-level driver may need to be from the
   same vendor (that is, use both the Microsoft drivers or both the
   vendor-supplied drivers). Microsoft MS-DOS drivers are only licensed
   for use with the Microsoft Mouse and only guaranteed to work with the
   Microsoft Mouse.

<P><LI>Look for multiple MOUSE.DRV files.
<P>
   Search the drive for multiple MOUSE.DRV files. If you find multiple
   mouse driver files, rename them to something else, except for the one
   in the Windows SYSTEM directory. To search for multiple mouse
   files, choose Search from the File Manager File menu, or type the
   following command at the MS-DOS root directory command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dir mouse.drv /s
</PRE><P>
   You can also check for other mouse-related files by typing:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dir mouse.* /s
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This DIR command only works if you have MS-DOS version 5.0 or
   later.

<P><LI>The MOUSE.DRV file located in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory may be
   corrupted or damaged. Rename the file and then expand MOUSE.DR_ from
   the original Windows disks to the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory by typing
   the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and pressing ENTER after
   each line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren c:\windows\system\mouse.drv mouse.old
      expand a:\mouse.dr_ c:\windows\system\mouse.drv
</PRE><P>
   Make sure the file is the correct size and date. The mouse driver
   supplied with Windows 3.1 is:
<P>
<PRE>      MOUSE.DRV     10672 03-10-92   3:10a

</PRE><P><LI>Make sure the correct mouse driver entry is in the SYSTEM.INI file.
<P>
   For the Microsoft Mouse, the following line should be in the [boot]
   section of the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      mouse.drv=mouse.drv
</PRE><P>
   No additional path to MOUSE.DRV should be indicated in this line.

<P><LI>Clean boot the system without loading an MS-DOS mouse driver.
<P>
   For more information about this procedure, query on the following
   words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      what and clean and boot and windows and tsr
</PRE>
<P><LI>Check the communications port (COM), I/O address, and interrupt (IRQ)
   being used by the mouse. Consider the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - You cannot use a mouse on COM3 or COM4.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - All hardware devices need a dedicated I/O or base address.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - The mouse should not share an interrupt (IRO setting) with
      another installed peripheral device.
</PRE><P>
   If there is a conflict, make the appropriate changes to the hardware
   settings and then retest the problem in Windows.
<P>
   Standard IRQ and I/O information for the Microsoft Mouse:
<P>
<PRE>      Device                  IRQ         I/O
      ---------------------------------------

      COM1                    4           03F8h
      COM2                    3           02F8h
      PS/2 port               12          060h
      Microsoft Bus Card      2,3,4,5     23Ch-23Fh or 238h-23Bh

   To test this hardware information, use the Microsoft Diagnostics
   utility (MSD) after loading an MS-DOS level mouse driver, or use the
   MS-DOS DEBUG command. For more information on using Debug, query on
   the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      debug and serial and mouse and prompt and displayed

</PRE><P><LI>Choosing a different port to test the mouse.
<P>
   The Windows mouse driver searches in the following order:
<P>
<P><PRE>      InPort, Bus, PS/2, COM2, COM1
</PRE><P>
   If a mouse is on COM1 and one of these other ports exists and is
   incorrectly identified as having a mouse connected, the port may
   trick the Windows mouse driver into thinking the mouse is located on
   the wrong port. If the mouse is on a PS/2-style port, you may
   want to try it on COM1 or COM2. If on COM2, then try COM1.

<P><LI>Some third-party applications replace the Windows mouse, keyboard, or
   communications drivers. The normal values in the SYSTEM.INI file for
   these drivers are:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [boot]
      mouse.drv=mouse.drv
      comm.drv=comm.drv
      keyboard.drv=keyboard.drv
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      [386enh]
      mouse=*vmd
</PRE><P>
   Check the size and dates of the MOUSE.DRV, COMM.DRV, and KEYBOARD.DRV
   drivers to make sure they are the correct drivers. The following
   versions of these driver are supplied with Windows 3.1:
<P>
<PRE>      COMM.DRV          9280 03-10-92   3:10a
      KEYBOARD.DRV      7568 03-10-92   3:10a
      MOUSE.DRV        10672 03-10-92   3:10a

   If necessary, expand these files from the original disks.

</PRE><P><LI>Check the MOUSE.INI settings:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Make sure there is only one MOUSE.INI file and that it is located
      in the Windows directory or where the MOUSE= environment
      variable is pointing. To search for multiple MOUSE.INI files,
      choose Search from the File menu in File Manager, or issue the
      following command from the MS-DOS root directory command prompt:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         dir mouse.ini /s

      NOTE: This DIR command only works if you have MS-DOS 5.0.

    - Make sure the MouseType= line in the [mouse] section of the
      MOUSE.INI file is pointing to the correct port for your mouse:

      Line           Description
      -------------------------------------------------------

      Serial1        For the mouse on COM1
      Serial2        For the mouse on COM2
      PS2            For the mouse on a PS/2-style mouse port
      Bus            If you are using an earlier bus card
      InPort1        If you are using an InPort card:
                     - Jumper 3 set to primary
      InPort2        If you are using an InPort card:
                     - Jumper 3 set to secondary

    The Bus setting is for the earlier Microsoft Bus mouse; the InPort
    setting is for the later Microsoft InPort mouse.

</PRE><P><LI>Try running in standard mode. If the problem only occurs in 386
<P><PRE>    enhanced mode, try starting Windows with the /D:X parameter
    (WIN /D:X). If the mouse works, add the following line to the
    [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       EmmExclude=A000-EFFF
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    If this solves the problem, you should continue to troubleshoot in
    this area, either forcing the mouse driver to load low, or
    determining where there is an address conflict.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Try using the standard video drivers that ship with Windows
<P><PRE>    (either EGA or VGA).
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you are having trouble using a mouse from a third-party vendor
<P><PRE>    that supplied its own mouse driver for Windows, if possible, try
    another brand of mouse that uses a driver supplied by Windows. If
    this mouse works in Windows on your machine, contact the
    manufacturer of the non-functional mouse for technical support.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Mouse Pointer Movement Is Erratic</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If the mouse is jumpy, lower the Sensitivity value in the Mouse section
   of Control Panel.

<P><LI>If the mouse is jumpy in Program Manager group windows, lower the
   granularity settings in the Desktop icon of Control Panel.

<P><LI>If you are using the MS-DOS-based mouse driver MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS
   version 7.04 or later, add the /Y switch to the end of the mouse command
   line as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\windows\mouse.com /y
</PRE>
<P><LI>Follow the troubleshooting steps in the above section, "Mouse Does
   Not Function in Windows."

<P><LI>It is possible that the erratic mouse movement you are experiencing
   is highly specific to the application, video card, machine BIOS,
   keyboard BIOS, or machine type you are using. For more information about
   these specific issues, query on the following words in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      mouse and erratic or jumpy or wild or jerky
