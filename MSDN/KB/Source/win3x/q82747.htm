<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows version 3.1 uses a network device driver to manage
printing to network servers by integrating many network printing
utilities into Windows. Printing enhancements that are not supported by
the network driver and that rely on hooking MS-DOS calls or ROM BIOS
calls may not work correctly when Windows prints directly to the port.
Using LPT1.DOS (or LPT1.OS2) passes printer output through MS-DOS to
these enhancements; however, being terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR),
these enhancements may create problems in Windows unless the program
takes the usual precautions necessary to make a TSR program compatible
with Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The most common MS-DOS enhancement for printing is the network printer
redirection, which allows a network user to print documents on a
printer attached to a server. Examples of printer redirection
utilities include the NET USE command in Microsoft LAN Manager and the
CAPTURE command in Novell NetWare.
<P>
Windows handles network redirections using a Windows network driver, a
program that Windows uses to manage the network. These drivers make
printing over the network transparent to the user and also allow the
user to connect and disconnect to network printers.
<P>
If you have a network for which a network driver is not installed by
Windows Setup, contact your network vendor to determine if a Windows
driver is available. Windows 3.1 installs a driver for all major
networks, including Novell Netware, Microsoft LAN Manager, Microsoft
MS-Net, Banyan Vines, 3Com 3+Share and 3+Open, Artisoft LANtastic, and
IBM DOS LAN Requester. In some cases, the driver ships with the
network software and not Windows itself.
<P>
When you print a document on a network, Windows calls the network
driver to determine if the port in use is connected to a network
printer. If so, the network driver is expected to open a file handle
to the network device. If the network driver reports that the device
is not connected to the network, Windows prints to the port using the
Windows COMM driver. The COMM driver does direct port input/output
(I/O); it does not call MS-DOS or the BIOS. Therefore, a printing
enhancement not supported by the network driver is bypassed by
Windows. Printing enhancements work by hooking either INT 21h writes
or INT 17h, the BIOS functions to control the printer. The COMM driver
cannot use INT 17h because of performance considerations; calling INT
17h from Windows would require multiple protected-to-real mode
transitions for each byte of output.
<P>
Remote spooling enhancements such as Novell's RPRINTER do not require
any special support on the machine that creates the printout; the
network driver supports connections to network printers whether they
are on a server or on another workstation. There are known problems
with earlier versions of RPRINTER that were corrected by Novell. If
you encounter problems with RPRINTER in Windows 3.1, contact Novell
for the latest version.
<P>
The only caution for using RPRINTER or LANSpool is not to print to the
same port as a local port through the Windows COMM driver. This causes
the output to be mixed randomly with the output from RPRINTER. If the
workstation running RPRINTER needs to print to the same printer,
connect the port over the network. Printing is not as fast in this
case, but the output is correctly sequenced.
<P>
There is no explicit support in Windows for non-network printing
enhancements that hook MS-DOS or ROM BIOS function calls. In general,
the way to use these enhancements is to cause Windows to use MS-DOS
calls instead of the Windows COMM driver. This is the reason for
LPT1.DOS and LPT1.OS2 (new Windows 3.1 users see the former).
Connecting to these ports causes Windows to print using MS-DOS calls
instead of the Windows COMM driver. Alternately, you can turn off the
Fast Printing Direct To Port check box in the Connect dialog box. (To
access this dialog box, open Printers icon in Control Panel.) In
general, printing performance and error condition handling are poorer;
however, printing enhancements see the output to the printer when they
are passed through MS-DOS.
<P>
Printing enhancements are TSR programs. Like all TSR programs, they
require special precautions to avoid problems in Windows. If a
printing enhancement fails in Windows, by crashing or causing
incorrect output, it may be incompatible with Windows because it does
not handle multiple MS-DOS Virtual Machines (VMs) or critical
sections. Some enhancements may work if no MS-DOS VMs are open; try
printing from a Windows application without any MS-DOS applications or
MS-DOS prompts running.
