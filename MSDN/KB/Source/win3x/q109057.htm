<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 installs a Network group in the
Program Manager. The icons included in this group depend on the network
installation you chose during Setup.
<P>
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 allows you to rebuild the default program
groups (Accessories, Games, Main, Startup, and Network). To rebuild the
defaults, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Run.

<P><LI>On the Command Line, type "WINSETUP /P" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>The contents of the new Network group depends on the network installation
chosen during the initial Setup.
<P>
NOTE: Previous versions of Microsoft Windows use SETUP /P to rebuild the
default groups.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Setup has several different options. You can
install Windows for Workgroups for no network functionality, for the
Windows for Workgroups network, for a primary network other than the
Windows for Workgroups network, or for the Windows for Workgroups network
and a secondary network. The icons available in the Network group are
dependent on the installation choice you make. The icons re-created by the
WINSETUP /P command are also dependent on your installation choice.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 1</h3>
 
<P>
If you install Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with the No Windows Support For
Networks option, a Network group containing the following icons is
generated:
<P>
<PRE>   Network Setup, Mail, Schedule+, and Remote Access.

</PRE></OL>WINSETUP /P re-creates the Network group as listed above.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 2</h3>
 
<P>

Networks option and choose not to install Mail and Schedule+, a Network
group containing the following icons is generated:
<P>
<PRE>   Network Setup, Mail, and Remote Access.

</PRE>NOTE: Mail is installed for Microsoft At Work PC Fax support. The only way
to not install Mail is to NOT install At Work PC Fax.
<P>
WINSETUP /P re-creates the Network group as mentioned above and adds a
Schedule+ icon with a plain design. (The plain icon is generated because
SCHDPLUS.EXE is not on your computer. If you choose not to install At
Work PC Fax and Mail, a plain Mail icon is also generated.)
<P>
<P><h3>Example 3</h3>
 
<P>

<PRE>   Network Setup, Mail, Remote Access, Log On/Off, Net Watcher, WinPopUp,
