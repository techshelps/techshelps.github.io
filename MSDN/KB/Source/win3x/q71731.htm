The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are several special steps that must be taken to successfully
install Windows on the IBM L40 386SX Laptop. If these steps are not
taken, the following may occur:

<UL><LI>The system stops responding (hang) during setup.
<LI>The system hangs during bootup when HIMEM.SYS is executed.
<LI>Windows exhibits erratic behavior.
<P>
</UL>This information applies to Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, and 3.0a. This
information does not apply to later versions of Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Keyboard</h3>
 
<P>
The IBM L40 386SX Laptop has a detachable numeric keypad that must be
attached when the Setup program is run. If the keypad is not attached,
Setup will detect an 84-key keyboard, rather than the 101-key
keyboard. In this case, the "Enhanced 101 or 102 key US" choice should
be selected.
<P>
Accepting the 84-key choice will not allow the keypad to be used with
Windows, if it is attached later.
<P>
<P><h3>Mouse</h3>
 
<P>
"Microsoft or IBM PS/2 Mouse" should be selected in Setup.
<P>
<P><h3>HIMEM.SYS</h3>
 
<P>
The IBM L40 is a PS/2, but it does not have a Micro Channel bus. The
L40 uses the AT-style bus, which causes HIMEM.SYS to use A20 handler
number 1. This will cause the system to hang, or cause repeated beeps,
during bootup. The IBM L40 requires HIMEM.SYS to use handler number 2.
The following line needs to be in the CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=&lt;drive&gt;&lt;pathname&gt;HIMEM.SYS /M:2

</PRE><h3>L40 Suspend/Resume Option</h3>
 
<P>
The L40 has a Suspend/Resume option, which allows you to close the
machine to change batteries and retain work in memory. This option
will cause erratic behavior in Windows unless the following procedure
is performed:

<OL><P><LI>The file PM_BIOS.386 must be in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. This
   file can be found on the IBM Reference Disk accompanying the L40.

<P><LI>The following lines must be added to the [386ENH] section of the
   SYSTEM.INI:
<P>
<P><PRE>      EMMExclude=E000-EFFF
      DMABufferSize=064
      Device=PM_BIOS.386
</PRE><P>
</OL>According to IBM, Windows should function normally on the L40 Laptop
after these steps have been taken.
