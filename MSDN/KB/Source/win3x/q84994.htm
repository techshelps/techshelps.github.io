<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The order in which the cursor highlights cycles through the Group icons in
Program Manager (when you press CTRL+TAB or CTRL+F6) cannot be set,
changed, or preserved in any way. Although you may prefer the cursor
highlight to always move from left to right through the icons on the bottom
of the program manager, this logical order (left to right) is not always
present and cannot be set.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot set or preserve the order in which the cursor selection
moves. An order does exist, but it results from a nonlinear algorithm
within the Windows internal code (USER.EXE). This order, by nature of
the algorithm, is not always predictable.
<P>
The order assignment that USER.EXE issues is called the "z-order".
This name was chosen by analogy to the z-axis on a multidimensional
Cartesian coordinate system. As you look at a representation of such a
coordinate system illustrated on the printed page, you must visualize
the z-axis rising up vertically toward you perpendicular to the plane
of the page. Similarly, opening all of the group windows in Program
Manager and selecting the Cascade command from the Windows menu
results in the z-order arrangement of the open document windows.
<P>
When you cycle through the selections by pressing CTRL+TAB, you will
find the highlight moves sequentially through the stack.
<P>
The z-order may be temporarily reflected in the closed group icons if
you were to close each of the windows following the cascaded
arrangement. The highlight movement would then proceed from left to
right using CTRL+TAB, but the order would eventually be lost as you
continue to use the Program Manager.
<P>
The z-order associated with the movement of the cursor highlight in
the Program Manager should not be confused with the left to right
arrangement of the group icons themselves or the order in which they
are displayed in the Window menu of the Program Manager. These
settings can be saved by selecting Save Settings On Exit from the
Options menu in Program Manager.
<P>
