The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run SETUP.EXE from Microsoft Windows to change the system
configuration, the Setup program checks the hard drive for the necessary
files. If the files are not already on the hard drive, SETUP.EXE refers to
the SETUP.INF file for the locations of the files on the source disks and
prompts you to insert the correct disk in drive A.
<P>
If you attempt to use 5.25-inch disks after originally installing from
3.5-inch disks or attempt to use 3.5-inch disks after originally
installing from 5.25-inch disks, the Setup program may continue to
prompt for the correct disk at some point during installation.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the SETUP.INF files differ between the 3.5-inch
and 5.25-inch versions.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you no longer have the same size disks from which you originally
installed, you can work around this problem by backing up the SETUP.INF
file in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. Then replace it with the SETUP.INF
file (which is not compressed) on Disk 1 of the source disks that you want
to use.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can be reproduced as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Install for a VGA monitor from 3.5-inch disks.

<P><LI>Run SETUP.EXE.

<P><LI>From the Options menu, choose Change System Configuration.

<P><LI>Choose EGA.

<P><LI>When prompted for a disk, try all five 5.25-inch disks. By trying
   all five disks each time Setup prompts you for a new disk, you can
   get past several prompts. However, eventually Setup prompts you for
   Disk 5 and refuses to accept any of the 5.25-inch disks.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This test does not work if you have previously installed for EGA
because the required files will already be on the hard drive.
