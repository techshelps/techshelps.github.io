The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A SoftRIP error message is an indication of depleted or insufficient
resources (most likely GDI) that usually occurs when you try to print a
complex image.
<P>
Even though the Program Manager may show a lot of available resources, it
cannot accurately report how much of each kind of resource is available. As
a result, you cannot use the percentage of resources available as an
indication of whether a specific action is possible or will produce a
SoftRIP failure. (The RIP portion of the term SoftRIP stands for "raster
imaging program.")
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When this error occurs, the workaround is to take the same steps you
would normally take for any reduced resources problem. The following
is a list of things you can do to increase the amount of resources
available. Where the action suggested requires making modifications to
an .INI file, be sure to make a backup copy of the .INI file before
making any changes.

<OL><P><LI>Reduce the number of resources being consumed by the application by
   closing open windows, eliminating custom menu bars and commands,
   turning off resource consuming options (that is, in Word for Windows,
   don't display the Ruler or Ribbon because of the many icons they
   contain).

<P><LI>If the application allows you to print the same image from different
   views, print from a view that consumes fewer resources (that is, in
   PowerPoint for Windows, try printing from the Title Sorter view).

<P><LI>Reduce the number of applications running concurrently.

<P><LI>Reduce the number of icons being used by the Program Manager
   (eliminate groups by removing the appropriate line(s) in the
   PROGMAN.INI file and restart Windows).

<P><LI>Remove the unused screen fonts from your WIN.INI [FONTS] section, and
   restart Windows.

<P><LI>Remove the unused soft fonts from your WIN.INI printer section and
   restart Windows.

<P><LI>Reduce the complexity of the image or document.
<P>
</OL>A common situation that can produce this error message is printing a
complex image to a device that has no internal memory. As a result,
the entire image must be rendered in the computer's memory and then
sent to the device as a bitmap (raster imaging program - RIP). A
common device of this type is the Hewlett-Packard (HP) PaintJet.
<P>
The measure of an image's complexity is the number of graphics
primitives that must be used to render that image. An image that may
not seem too complex, might actually consume a great deal of
resources. Typically images that contain ovals with gradient fills or
shading require far more resources to render than rectangular objects.
