The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Running Microsoft Windows for Workgroups on a computer with one
5.25-inch or 3.5-inch high-density disk drive and a hard disk with 9.5
megabytes (MB) available memory is fully supported. (We recommend that
you have a hard disk with 14.5 MB available memory). Windows for
Workgroups is not designed to be installed on workstations without
hard disks (computers without hard disks that are connected to a
network), and Microsoft does not support running Windows for
Workgroups with any type of diskless workstation. However, a
workaround to set up Windows for Workgroups on Novell workstations
that do not have hard disks is available.
<P>
This article contains information that you can use to install Windows
for Workgroups on a Novell NetWare workstation that does not have a
hard disk.
<P>
NOTE: A true diskless workstation (one with no floppy disk drive or
hard disk drive) using a network adapter with a boot ROM does not work
with Windows for Workgroups. This is because the boot ROM establishes
a network connection and does not allow the Windows for Workgroups
network drivers to coexist with the boot ROM.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To set up Windows for Workgroups on a diskless workstation on a Novell
network, use the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Start the computer with a network boot disk and log on as
   supervisor.
<P>
   NOTE: If you upgraded from Windows 3.1 by using the SETUP /A command
   should remove the Windows 3.1 shared directory before continuing. For
   more information on upgrading a shared networked Windows directory,
   query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      and attrib and flag
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run SETUP /A from the Windows for Workgroups Disk 1. This process
   expands the Windows for Workgroups files and places them in a shared
   network directory.

<P><LI>Have each user start his or her computer with a network boot disk
   and log on. Run SETUP or SETUP /N (recommended) from the shared
   directory created in step 2. When prompted for the directory name,
   enter the network user's home directory.
<P>
   (A network boot disk contains the MS-DOS operating system and
   necessary files to establish network connection, that is, IPX and
   NETX. The boot disk must have approximately 1 MB of free disk space.
   The free disk space needed varies depending on which NDIS network card
   driver is installed.)
<P>
   NOTE: Windows 3.1 directories created with SETUP /N can only be
   upgraded to Windows for Workgroups with SETUP /N. Windows 3.1
   installations created with SETUP must be upgraded by SETUP.

<P><LI>After selecting the network adapter type and settings, the
   Compatible Networks dialog box appears. Select Novell NetWare and
   choose the Add button.
<P>
   During the setup process the following message appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Setup cannot find or cannot update your system
      files on drive A:. If you started your system from
      a floppy disk, be sure to remove write-protection
      from your system startup (boot) disk. Then insert
      the disk into drive A and choose Retry.
      To copy system files to your Windows directory
      choose Cancel.
</PRE><P>
   This is normal. If your bootable floppy boot contains approximately 1
   MB of free disk space, select Retry.
<P>
</OL>When the setup process is finished, the boot disk will contain the
following files:

</PRE><h3>Notes on Using Workstations Without Hard Disks</h3>
 

<UL><LI>A workstation without a hard disk has the same system requirements
   for running Windows for Workgroups 3.1 as a workstation with a hard
   disk drive. (The RAM requirement may be greater if you are using a
   RAM drive).

<LI>Running Windows for Workgroups in standard mode (the highest mode on
   an 80286 computer) makes it necessary to log on to the Windows for
   Workgroups network before you run Windows. Network commands such as
   Net Start and Net Logon Username will require information from the
   SYSTEM.INI file in the Windows user directory. Copy this file from the
   Windows for Workgroups user directory to the network boot disk. Note
   that changes made in the Networks dialog box in Control Panel will not
   update the SYSTEM.INI file on the boot disk. If you make changes in
   Control Panel, you must recopy the SYSTEM.INI file to the boot floppy
   disk before the changes can take effect.

<LI>To share local workstation resources (such as floppy disk drives,
   printers, and CD-ROM drives), you must create a RAM drive and set your
   SET TEMP environment variable to its location. The RAM drive needs to
   be of considerable size (2048K or larger) if you are planning to share
   a local printer because Print Manager will queue jobs into the RAM
   drive. To set up a 2 MB RAM drive, add the following line to your
   CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
<PRE>        DEVICE=A:\RAMDRIVE.SYS 2048 /E
</PRE>
