The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Intel EtherExpress 16 MCA is not directly supported or
specifically listed in the Network Adapter options in Windows for
Workgroups version 3.1. However, this network adapter should operate
with Windows for Workgroups if it is set up correctly.
<P>
NOTE: The Intel EtherExpress MCA IS supported in later versions of
Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
The Intel EtherExpress 16 MCA is the Microchannel version of the Intel
EtherExpress 16 or 16 TP that Microsoft ships with the Windows for
Workgroups Starter Kits and User Kits. Both network adapters use the
same Media Access Control (MAC) driver. The Microchannel version of
the Intel EtherExpress 16 should not require any changes to the
PROTOCOL.INI or any other configuration files in order to operate with
Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To install and configure the EtherExpress MCA LAN Adapter for use with
Windows for Workgroups version 3.1, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Install and set up the Intel EtherExpress MCA using the reference
   disk provided with the adapter.

<P><LI>Make note of the configuration, such as the IRQ, I/O Port address,
   and Base Memory settings.

<P><LI>During the installation of Windows for Workgroups, select the Intel
   EtherExpress 16 or 16 TP when prompted for the network adapter card
   information.

<P><LI>The IRQ, I/O Port, and Base Memory settings must match those that
   were set up using the reference disk.
<P>
   NOTE: If the card settings are changed at any time in the future,
   make sure those same changes are made in the Control Panel Network
   Adapters Settings section. Conversely, if IRQ, I/O or Base Memory
   settings are ever changed with the Control Panel or in the
   PROTOCOL.INI file, be sure to use the reference diskette and make
   the corresponding changes.
<P>
</OL>For additional information, contact Intel technical support.
<P>
The EtherExpress 16 MCA is manufactured by Intel, a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this products' performance or reliability.
