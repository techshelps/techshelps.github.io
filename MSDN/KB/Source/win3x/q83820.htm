The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0 and 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX.EXE) allows MS-DOS to
communicate with a CD-ROM drive. If MSCDEX.EXE is loaded and a
permanent swap file is created in the extended partition, Windows
version 3.0 Setup may report it as temporary. Actually, the permanent
swap file has indeed been created, and is in use by Windows.
<P>
NOTE: The information in this article does NOT apply to Windows
versions later than 3.0a.
<P>
<P><h3>Definitions of Primary and Extended Partitions</h3>
 
<P>
The following are definitions of primary and extended partitions:

<UL><LI>The primary partition is the area on a hard drive that is set up,
   using the MS-DOS FDISK utility or some other partitioning software,
   and assigned drive letter C.

<LI>The extended partition is the area on a hard drive that is set up,
   using the MS-DOS FDISK utility or some other partitioning software,
   as an additional logical drive.
<P>
   For example, with a 40 MB hard drive, you can create a primary
   partition of 20 MB, which can be assigned to drive C, and an
   extended partition of 20 MB, which can be assigned a logical drive
   D. Drive D is the extended partition and, if specified, will be 20
   MB. Using the same example, if you want three logical drives, then
   drive D can be allocated 10 MB, and drive E can be allocated the
   remaining 10 MB of the extended partition. The extended partition
   now has two logical drives within it: drives D and E.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Determining if Swap File Is in Use</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps can be performed to see if the permanent swap file
is actually in use.
<P>
Important: If a permanent swap file already resides in the extended
partition, do not perform step 3. Make no changes other than what is
described below.

<OL><P><LI>Add the setting Paging=no to the [386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI
   file.

<P><LI>Start Windows in 386 enhanced mode and determine the amount of free
   memory.
<P>
   To determine this information, from the Help menu, choose About
   Program Manager. This information is referred to as "free RAM."

<P><LI>Restart Windows in real mode, and create a permanent swap file in the
   extended partition.
<P>
   Make sure you note the size of the swap file.

<P><LI>Remove the setting Paging=no from the SYSTEM.INI file.

<P><LI>Restart Windows in 386 enhanced mode and note the amount of free
   memory. This should be very close to the amount of "free RAM"
   plus the size of the permanent swap file.

<P><LI>Create a new, permanent swap file of a different size, and restart
   Windows in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
   Note the amount of free memory. This should reflect the change in
   size that was made to the permanent swap file.
<P>
</OL>If the permanent swap file is created in the primary partition, the
Windows Setup program will accurately report this information even if
MSCDEX is loaded. If MSCDEX is NOT loaded, Setup will accurately
report the status of the permanent swap file regardless of where it
resides. This is not, however, a problem with MSCDEX or the swap file
program. Rather, it is the way in which Setup handles the detection of
the swap file.
<P>
This information applies to MSCDEX.EXE versions 2.0 and later. Users
running 386 enhanced mode Windows should not be running MSCDEX.EXE
versions earlier than 2.0. You can obtain the latest update through
your CD-ROM drive manufacturer.
<P>
For more information about swap files, see Chapter 13, "Optimizing
Windows," starting on page 520 of the version 3.0 "Microsoft Windows
User's Guide."
