The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains the process Windows follows to find or re-create
an existing permanent swap file if a swap file problem is detected.
<P>
The swap file is an element of the memory management services Windows
provides. It is used to swap application code and data that is not
being used from RAM to the hard disk. In this manner, Windows can
provide more memory to your applications than is physically installed
on your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After you type "win" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt,
Windows reads the SYSTEM.INI file for various startup information,
including the size, type and whereabouts of the swap file. If Windows finds
a reference to a swap file, it looks for it (386SPART.PAR) on the hard
disk.
<P>
If 386SPART.PAR is the wrong size (zero bytes, for example), Windows
(WIN386.EXE) deletes and recreates 386SPART.PAR. If 386SPART.PAR does
not exist at all, the following error message is displayed on a blue
screen:
<P>
<PRE>   Corrupt Swap-File Warning

</PRE>This error message asks if you would like to delete the corrupted swap
file. If you choose No, Windows does not attempt to correct the bad
permanent swap file, and starts normally. Until you choose Yes, every
time you start Windows, you will receive this error message.
<P>
If you choose Yes, the next time you start Windows, CPWIN386.CPL (the
386 Enhanced portion of Control Panel) is used to create a new swap
file. If the permanent swap file is created successfully, no further
problems occur and all the settings in your Windows configuration
should be the same as they were before you had swap file problems.
<P>
If Windows cannot find CPWIN386.CPL or if there is a problem with the
file, the following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   The CPWIN386.CPL utility could not be run. Either CPWIN386.CPL
   could not be found, an access error occurred on the file, or there
   was insufficient memory to run the utility. The permanent swap file
   can not be set up.

</PRE>If you receive this error message, make sure the file, CPWIN386.CPL,
is in your SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
If CPWIN386.CPL loads successfully but fails to create a permanent
swap file, the following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   The CPWIN386 utility was not able to set up the permanent swap
   file.

</PRE>This error message could be caused by insufficient disk space or other
problems that normally prevent permanent swap file creation.
