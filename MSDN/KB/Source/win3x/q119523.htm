<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you are troubleshooting printing problems on a notebook computer,
first determine whether the computer is connected to a docking station. If
the printer cable connects to the docking station, the problems may be
caused by a poor connection between the port and its connector in the
docking station, or the connector in the docking station may be defective.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A docking station acts as an intermediate device between the notebook
computer and external devices such as printers, CD players, standard
keyboards, and disk drives. These devices are permanently connected to the
docking station. This allows notebook computer users to use these devices,
yet quickly mount or unmount the computer from them. The computer plugs
into the station rather than the devices.
<P>
When you print from a notebook computer connected to a docking station, you
may receive garbled output, even when printing from MS-DOS. If you
experience this problem when your computer is connected to a docking
station, do the following to correct the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Turn off the computer and the printer.

<P><LI>Disconnect the printer cable from the docking station and connect it to
   the appropriate port on the notebook computer.

<P><LI>Turn on both the computer and the printer.

<P><LI>Print a text file from MS-DOS (for example, the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or the
   SETUP.TXT file from the Windows directory). If this file prints
   successfully, proceed to step 5; if not, use another printer cable and
   repeat the test. If the test fails again, take the computer to a service
   technician to test the port.

<P><LI>Continue with the standard Windows printing troubleshooting steps (print
   from Windows Write, print to a file, and so forth).
