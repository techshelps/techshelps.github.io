<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
All Windows communications applications will benefit from the improved
system-wide communications features in Microsoft Windows operating
system version 3.1. Most of the serial communications problems
experienced by users of Windows 3.0 are corrected in Windows 3.1.
Below is a summary of the changes:

<UL><LI>COM port addresses and IRQs can be configured in the Control
   Panel. Windows 3.0 used preset address values for serial ports.
   Windows 3.1 now allows any port address and IRQ to be used. This
   solves problems using ports COM3 and COM4, for which Windows 3.0
   used nonstandard default values.

<LI>Faster bit rates. Applications for Windows can now set speeds
   higher than 19.2 kilobits per second (Kbps), up to 57.6 Kbps. Contact
   your Windows software manufacturer for an update to support this new
   feature.

<LI>Reduced system overhead. Windows 3.1 is fine-tuned for better
   performance overall, including faster throughput and fewer
   errors during serial communications. A new driver interface
   allows Windows to pass data in blocks to the driver, rather than
   passing data a character at a time.  See the Windows 3.1 Device
   Development Kit (DDK) for details. Windows 3.0 passes data one
   character at a time.

<LI>The high-speed 16550 UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver
   Transmitter) is now supported for Windows applications.

<LI>EnableCommNotification API. Windows applications can register to
   be notified by a window message when serial port events occur,
   rather than performing constant polling, which reduces overall
   system performance.

<LI>Serial ports on the same IRQ can be used "in rotation." Although
   on most PCs, serial ports that use the same IRQ cannot be used
   simultaneously, Windows 3.0 sometimes prevented them from being
   used in rotation, one after another. This is corrected in
   Windows 3.1.

<LI>Full-duplex improvements. Some users experienced lockups during
   full-duplex transfers at fast bit rates under Windows 3.0.
   These problems are corrected in Windows 3.1.
