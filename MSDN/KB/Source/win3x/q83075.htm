The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, the free memory
reported by the MEM /D command is defined by the following items:

<OL><P><LI>The PIF file that was used for running the MS-DOS virtual machine.

<P><LI>The free conventional memory available when Windows was started.

<P><LI>The load location of the Windows applications programming interface
   (API) translation buffers (in 386 enhanced mode only).
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The KB Required and KB Desired setting of the DOSPRMPT.PIF file is, by
default, -1 for KB desired and -1 for KB required. This is a special
setting that means the memory settings for the MS-DOS virtual machine
must be set to a maximum. Settings must be as high as possible and
cannot be smaller. If there is room for a 572K MS-DOS virtual machine
on a system, then it will be 572K, and will not be less than 572K.
<P>
Note: This maximum virtual machine size is not determined by available
memory, it is determined by the amount of available address space.
Available address space is determined by the amount of free
conventional memory when Windows is started.
<P>
In order to free a greater amount of available conventional memory
before going into Windows, it may be necessary to limit the number of
device drivers that load into conventional memory. This may be done by
either not allowing those drivers to load, or if the drivers do load,
loading them into the UMB (upper memory block) area.
<P>
The API Translation buffers also affect the available memory in an
MS-DOS virtual machine. The API Translation buffers allow protected
mode and real mode to communicate. These buffers will load into the
UMB area if space is available. If space is not available, then the
API buffers will load into conventional memory and will use between 4K
and 16K.
<P>
Note: Due to memory rounding, the numbers reported by the MEM command
may often differ slightly because the allocated settings are
translated into KB Required and KB Desired PIF settings.
