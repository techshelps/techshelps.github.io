The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Windows, you may get the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Group file &lt;xxxx&gt;.GRP is invalid or damaged; reconstruct the group.

</PRE>When you choose the OK button to continue, you may see a blank screen
within Program Manager, or you may be missing some of your groups.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem could occur for any of the following reasons:

<UL><LI>You are running in real mode. (This applies to Windows 3.0 and 3.0a
   only.) To conserve memory, real mode limits the number of groups
   that can be displayed in Program Manager. Typically you will be
   limited to 8-10 groups. Combine some of your groups or start up in
   standard or enhanced mode.

<LI>A group (.GRP) file is deleted or damaged.

<LI>The Windows files were moved into another directory without
   reinstalling, and the PROGMAN.INI file was not updated to reflect
   this change.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can rebuild the Main, Accessories, and Games groups by doing the
following:

<OL><P><LI>From the Program Manager's File menu, choose Run.

<P><LI>Program Manager prompts you for a command line. Type
<P>
<P><PRE>      setup /p
</PRE><P>
   and choose the OK button. Be sure to leave a space between "setup" and
   "/p", or you the error message "Specified path is invalid" will be
   displayed. ("Setup/p" is interpreted as one single filename which
   cannot be found.)
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Setup /P rebuilds only the Main, Accessories, and Games group with
the default Windows application icons. Any other external groups or icons
that may have been damaged or lost are not restored with this Setup switch.
There is no automatic method available for individual groups that may have
been damaged or lost. If you do not want your Main, Games, or Accessories
group to be reset to their defaults, edit the PROGMAN.INI file as follows:

<OL><P><LI>From Program Manager's File menu, choose Run.

<P><LI>Type
<P>
<P><PRE>      progman.ini
</PRE><P>
   and press ENTER. This starts Notepad and opens the PROGMAN.INI file.

<P><LI>In the [Groups] section, find the damaged or missing group and
   delete that line (see the example below). Renumber the remaining
   lines so they are in proper numerical order and the first group is
   labeled "group1."

<P><LI>From Notepad's File menu, choose Save.

<P><LI>Exit and restart Windows.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Upon exiting Windows, the Save Changes command may be unavailable
(dimmed) until the group file error is corrected.
<P>
The following is an example of a PROGMAN.INI file with a bad
TOOLBOOK.GRP file:
<P>
<PRE>   [Settings]
   Window=-1 -2 641 419 1
   SaveSettings=1
   MinOnRun=0
   AutoArrange=0

   [Groups]
   Group1=C:\WIN3\GAMES.GRP
   Group2=C:\WIN3\WINDOWSA.GRP
   Group3=c:\win3\TOOLBOOK.GRP
   Group4=C:\WIN3\MAIN.GRP
   Group5=C:\WIN3\ACCESSOR.GRP

</PRE></OL>It should appear as follows (please note that the [Settings] section
has not changed):
<P>
<PRE>   [Settings]
   Window=-1 -2 641 419 1
   SaveSettings=1
   MinOnRun=0
   AutoArrange=0

   [Groups]
   GROUP1=C:\WIN3\GAMES.GRP
   GROUP2=C:\WIN3\WINDOWSA.GRP
   GROUP3=C:\WIN3\MAIN.GRP
   GROUP4=C:\WIN3\ACCESSOR.GRP

</PRE>To rebuild single groups manually, follow the procedure outlined in
the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" on pages 87-88 for version 3.0
and on pages 76-77 for version 3.1. The "/p" parameter is not
documented in the documentation sent with the Windows product.
