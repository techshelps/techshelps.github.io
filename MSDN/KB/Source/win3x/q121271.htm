<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you are troubleshooting Novell NetWare issues, it is sometimes helpful
to eliminate the NetWare login script as a source of possible configuration
problems. This is consistent with the "clean boot" approach of eliminating
as many unknown factors as possible to isolate the cause of a specific
problem.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Novell NetWare employs a system of login scripts. These scripts are similar
to batch files and are executed whenever a user logs on to a NetWare file
server. Listed below are some of the various login scripts.
<P>
<P><h3>System Login Script</h3>
 
<P>
This script is processed first and applies to all users who log on to the
file server. It can be edited only by a NetWare Supervisor through the
SYSCON utility.
<P>
<P><h3>User Login Script</h3>
 
<P>
This script is unique to each user and is processed after the System Login
script. It can usually be edited by the user through SYSCON.
<P>
<P><h3>Default Login Script</h3>
 
<P>
This script is processed after the System Login script if there is no User
Login script for the user who is currently logging on. The Default Login
script is hard-coded into LOGIN.EXE and therefore cannot be edited.
<P>
There is a parameter on the LOGIN command that allows the user to specify a
text file to be used as an alternate login script, overriding all the
standard login scripts listed above. The command
<P>
<PRE>   LOGIN /S C:\LOGIN.TXT

</PRE>logs the user on to the currently attached file server and processes the
file C:\LOGIN.TXT as the login script, overriding all the standard NetWare
login scripts.
<P>
For a "clean logon" during troubleshooting, it is suggested that this login
script contain the following command line:
<P>
<PRE>   MAP INSERT S16:=SYS:PUBLIC

</PRE>This command assigns the drive letter Z: to the PUBLIC directory on the
file server (which contains the standard NetWare user utilities) and adds
this drive to the search path (MS-DOS PATH) so that the standard NetWare
commands are accessible to the user.
<P>
Novell NetWare is manufactured by Novell, Inc., a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
