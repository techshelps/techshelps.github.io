<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains commonly asked questions and answers for Microsoft At
Work PC Fax.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. Why does Mail constantly poll for new messages with At Work PC Fax
      installed?

   A. This behavior occurs only if you are attached to a shared fax modem.

      To correct this problem:

      1. Open Mail.

      2. From the Fax menu, choose Mode.

      3. Select the Work Off-Line check box. (When you are ready to send a
         fax, remove the check mark and choose View New Messages from the
         Fax menu.)

2. Q. Sometimes when I try to open a new fax message, Mail generates a
      general protection fault. This problem seems to occur randomly. How
      can I correct this problem?

   A. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
      here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

3. Q. When I start Mail and the fax tries to go online, I receive the
      following error. How can I avoid this error?

         Fax Transport cannot go on-line. Off-Line operation will continue.

   A. This error occurs under the following circumstances:

      - You have an external fax modem, and it is turned off or not
        correctly connected to the port.

      - You are attached to a shared network fax that is on a server
        not running Microsoft Mail, or the MAPI engine has not been
        started.

      - The shared fax user is connecting to the wrong share. Check
        the EFAXPUMP.INI file to ensure the path to the network fax is
        correct.

      - The network fax is working offline. (Go to Microsoft Mail on the
        network fax machine and choose Mode from the Fax menu to ensure
        the fax is working online.)

4. Q. What causes a fax to render correctly but then appear in my Inbox?

   A. If you send a fax to the same number that was entered during At Work
      PC Fax Setup in Control Panel, At Work PC Fax recognizes that it
      cannot call itself; therefore, it renders the fax and places it in
      your Inbox.

5. Q. Why does my Intel CAS modem fail to render the fax every time I
      try to send one?

   A. Changing the Image Quality setting from Best Available to Fine should
      correct this problem. To do this:

      1. Go to Microsoft Mail.

      2. From the Fax menu, choose Options.

      3. Change the Image Quality from Best Available to Fine.
