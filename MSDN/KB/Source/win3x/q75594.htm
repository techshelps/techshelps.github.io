<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The colors of a PCX image viewed in Windows 3.0's Paintbrush may not
match the color of the same PCX image viewed through another application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are several reasons for this discrepancy:

<UL><LI>The PCX graphical file format has no standard. It has gone through
   numerous changes dating back to the CGA (color graphics adapter).
   It is impossible to have one viewing program compatible with all
   these different versions.

<LI>Individual companies implement their own standards in different
   ways and to different extents.

<LI>Graphical standards are defined through different display adapters.
   Each display adapter has its own variation of a color palette and
   palette limitations (for example, number of colors appearing at one
   time).

<LI>Windows has a graphical user interface (GUI), which is making
   demands on display adapter memory at the same time the PCX image
   is. The hardware or display driver may not be able to handle the
   demand.

<LI>PCX images have a file header that contains a self-defining color
   table. This information may not transfer correctly.

<LI>Windows has defined and was built-around a new level of graphical
   format, the device independent bitmap (DIB), which is not directly
   compatible with PCX. DIBs were designed to get beyond the problems
   associated with the PCX format.
