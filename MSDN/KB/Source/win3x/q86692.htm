<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Drivers for the Thunder Board audio card from Media Vision are available in
the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 package. The drivers supplied with
Windows 3.1 use the Sound Blaster 1.5 driver to play wave audio files on
the Thunder Board. An updated wave audio driver written specifically for
the Thunder Board is available as part of the Windows 3.1 Windows Driver
Library (WDL).
<P>
The updated driver can be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Service
(MSDL) at (425) 936-6735. The file containing the driver is called
THUNDR.EXE. After updating the Thunder Board driver, remove the VSBD.386
and SNDBLST2.DRV files from your Windows\SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to the SYSTEM.INI File</h3>
 
<P>
The standard Windows 3.1 driver makes these changes to the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   [386Enh]
   device=vadlibd.386
   device=vsbd.386

   [drivers]
   MIDI=msadlib.drv
   Wave=sndblst2.drv

   [sndblst.drv]
   port=220
   int=5

</PRE>The updated Wave Audio driver makes these changes to the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   [386Enh]
   device=vadlibd.386
   device=vtbd.386

   [drivers]
   MIDI=msadlib.drv
   Wave=tbwave.drv

   [tbwave.drv]
   port=220
   int=5

</PRE>The settings for the I/O port address (220) and interrupt (5) are the
factory defaults. Valid settings for the I/O port address are 210, 220,
230, 240, 250, and 260. Valid settings for the interrupt are 2, 3, 5, and
7. The DMA channel is permanently set to channel 1 on the Thunder Board and
thus cannot be configured. To check the Thunder Board settings, run the
TBTEST program from the THUNDER directory on the hard drive.
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to the WIN.INI File</h3>
 
<P>
There are no changes made to the WIN.INI file.
<P>
Files Copied to the Windows\SYSTEM Subdirectory
 
<P>
The standard Windows 3.1 driver copies these files to the Windows\SYSTEM
subdirectory:
<P>
<PRE>   MSADLIB.DRV     3/10/92 22064
   SNDBLST2.DRV    3/10/92 14464
   VADLIBD.386     3/10/92  5542
   VSBD.386        3/10/92  5650

</PRE>The updated Wave Audio driver copies these files (in addition to those
listed above:
<P>
<PRE>   TBWAVE.DRV      3/19/92 25600
   VTBD.386        2/27/92  5665
