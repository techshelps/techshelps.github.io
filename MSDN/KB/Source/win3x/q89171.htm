The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information on Invisible Software's product Invisible
Network and its use with Microsoft Windows 3.0 and 3.1. The following
topics are included:

<UL><LI>Using Invisible Network with Windows 3.0
<LI>Using Invisible Network with Windows 3.1
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Using Invisible Network with Windows 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
Invisible Network provides nondedicated MS-DOS server operation in a
peer-to-peer environment. It will only function with Invisible
Software's proprietary Ethernet or twisted pair network adapters.
<P>
<P><h3>Setup</h3>
 
<P>
Invisible Network 2.21a or later should be used. It will be detected
by Windows 3.0 as "IBM PC LAN," provided that the network was loaded
before the Windows Setup program is run, and that the /I parameter
(used to disable Windows automatic hardware detection) is not being
used. This is the correct choice for this network.
<P>
<P><h3>Printing</h3>
 
<P>
Printing over the network to a shared printer should work correctly
using LPT1:, LPT2:, or LPT3:. It has been noted, however, that the
Windows Print Manager displays the message "A general network error
has occurred." In addition, "[NETWORK ERROR]" is displayed on the
status line for the redirected printer. For this reason, it is
recommended that you disable the use of the Print Manager by choosing
the Printers icon from the Control Panel and clearing the Use Print
Manager check box.
<P>
WARNING: If a job is printed while the Print Manager is in a restored
state (not minimized), the workstation hangs. This is an additional
reason to disable the Print Manager. Invisible Software is researching
this problem.
<P>
<P><h3>386 Enhanced Mode</h3>
 
<P>
386 enhanced mode is not recommended at this time on any machine that
is designated as a server (that is, any machine that shares a printer
and/or disk service). Workstations can run 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
Invisible Software recommends adding the following entries to the
[386enh] section of the Windows SYSTEM.INI file on workstations
running in 386 enhanced mode:
<P>
<PRE>   network=*vnetbios,*dosnet
   FileSysChange=off
   InDOSPolling=TRUE
   INT28Critical=TRUE
   ReflectDosInt2A=FALSE
   UniqueDOSPSP=FALSE
   LPT1AutoAssign=0
   LPT2AutoAssign=0
   LPT3AutoAssign=0
   PerVMFiles=0

</PRE>Additionally, you may need to add the line
<P>
<PRE>   EMMExclude=XXXX-YYYY

</PRE>where XXXX is the beginning address and YYYY is the ending address of
the network adapter in the reserved memory area.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Invisible Network with Windows 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
To run the Invisible Network with Windows 3.1, you must use
version 3.13.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Install Invisible Network into Windows 3.1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Run Windows 3.1.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Run.

<P><LI>Type "setup" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

<P><LI>From the Options menu, choose Change System Settings.

<P><LI>From the Network list box, choose Other Network.

<P><LI>When asked to insert the network driver disk, supply the
   following path:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\NET30
</PRE><P>
</OL>The Invisible Network software loads. You will have to exit and
restart Windows.
<P>
