</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows for Workgroups, password caching is a feature that maintains a
list of the passwords you have used and the resources to which they apply.
Passwords are saved and retrieved transparently to the user. The password
cache facilitates restoration of connections to shared resources when you
log on.
<P>
This article describes the functionality of file caching in Windows
for Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Password List File</h3>
 
<P>
When you log on to Windows for Workgroups, the network driver looks up your
username in the [Password Lists] section of SYSTEM.INI. This entry gives
the path to your password list file (PWL), which is encrypted to maintain
system security. Part of this file is decrypted using your logon password.
If the decryption is successful, your password cache file is unlocked. When
you log off, the password to your PWL file is erased from memory.
<P>
If there is no SYSTEM.INI entry for your username, or if the file named
there doesn't exist, a new PWL file is created for you, initially with no
passwords in it. Windows for Workgroups asks you to confirm your logon
password before it encrypts your PWL file.
<P>
When you need to establish a connection to a network resource (either
explicitly, from the Connect dialog box, or implicitly, at logon), the
network driver first attempts to make the connection with a blank password.
If the resource requires a password, the network driver then searches your
PWL file for an entry corresponding to the resource to which you are
connecting. That password is used on the next attempt to make a connection.
If there is no entry in the file for the resource, or if the password
recorded in the file is not correct (if, for example, the owner of the
server changed the password), a password prompt is displayed.
<P>
Whenever a password prompt is displayed, and the password you type turns
out to be the correct one for the resource, it is saved in your PWL file
for later use. If the server is running with share-level security (this
applies to Windows for Workgroups servers and to some Microsoft LAN Manager
servers), the server name and share name are recorded in the PWL file. If
the server is running with user-level security, the password you used works
for any share on that server, so a separate record containing only the
server name is created.
<P>
Additionally, if you choose to have your logon validated at a LAN Manager
domain controller, your LAN Manager logon password is stored in your PWL
file also, so that the only logon password you need to type is the one that
encrypts the PWL file.
<P>
NOTE: If a Windows for Workgroups client belongs to a workgroup and a
domain, and is using the same password (which may be cached) to logon, a
problem may occur if the passwords expire at different times and are no
longer synchronized. This can occur if the Windows for Workgroups
administrator enforces password changing (also called "aging"). The user is
prompted to change the workgroup password, but not the domain password.
When the domain password eventually expires, the user may not be able to
remember it and may not be able to logon to the domain.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Prevent the Saving of a Password in Your PWL File</h3>
 
<P>
Sometimes you may not want Windows for Workgroups to save a password. To
prevent the saving of a password, clear the Save This Password In Your
Password List option in the Enter Network Password dialog box. Next time
Windows for Workgroups attempts to connect to this resource, another
password prompt appears.
<P>
If you connect from the MS-DOS prompt (using the NET USE command), use the
/SAVEPW:NO option to prevent Windows for Workgroups from recording the
password in the PWL file.
<P>
If you connect without saving the password, Windows for Workgroups does not
add the password to your PWL file, but it does not delete the password if
it's already in the PWL file.
<P>
To disable password caching and prevent your PWL file from being accessed,
add the following line to the [NETWORK] section of the System.ini file:
<P>
<PRE>   PasswordCaching=no

</PRE><h3>PWL File Limits</h3>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups does not limit the length of time a password
remains valid. The PWL file is limited to 255 password entries. Once
there are 255 entries in the PWL file, adding another password causes
Windows for Workgroups to delete the oldest password. Each time a
password entry is used to make a connection, it's marked as the
"newest" entry, so frequently-used passwords are not the first
candidates for removal.
<P>
<P><h3>Password Caching Does Not Work When You Connect Using a UNC Name</h3>
 
<P>
If you try to open a file on a password-protected share by typing the UNC
name, password caching is not activated, so Windows for Workgroups cannot
make later connections for you. This happens because password caching is
done by the network driver, at the user interface (UI) level (the UI level
is where most interaction with the password cache occurs in Windows for
Workgroups). To make it possible for password caching to be available in
all circumstances, it would need to be implemented in the redirector
instead of at the UI level. Password caching at the redirector level would
have made Windows for Workgroups more complicated, due to the additional
interfaces, which would result in slower connection time. Password caching
at the redirector level would also increase the amount of memory used by
the basic and full redirectors, leaving less available memory for other MS-
DOS-based applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Location of the PWL File</h3>
 
<P>
Your PWL file can reside on any directory that Windows for Workgroups can
access without a password. If you move your PWL file, you must edit the
[Password Lists] section of your SYSTEM.INI file so it lists the correct
path. If you want to put the PWL file on a network server, there are some
restrictions:

<OL><P><LI>Because persistent connections are not restored until after the PWL
   file is open, if the file is to be stored on a Windows for
   Workgroups or LAN Manager server, you must type the path in UNC
   format, such as \\server\share\user\user.pwl (rather than
   x:\user\user.pwl).

<P><LI>Because the file is accessed using UNC when it is located on a
   network server, the server or share cannot require a password to
   connect. Additionally, Because the PWL file is not yet open, caching
   the password for the file's location does not help.

<P><LI>If you do not have write access to the server, you cannot save any
   new passwords in your PWL file.
