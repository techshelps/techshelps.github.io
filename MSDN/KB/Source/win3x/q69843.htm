The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses error messages that may be returned when you run
Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.1 from Microsoft Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following error messages may be returned when you run Lotus 1-2-3
version 3.1 from Windows 3.0 or 3.0a in real or standard mode or from
later versions of Windows in standard mode:
<P>
<P><h3>VM error[27]</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   VM error[27]: Not enough disk space for swap file
   "d:\XXXXXXXXX'"  (where XXXXXXXXX is a file name)

</PRE>This indicates that Lotus 1-2-3 has its swap file path set to a directory
that does not have sufficient space to create the swap file.
<P>
To work around the problem, try the following:

<OL><P><LI>Specify the SET 123SWAPPATH statement (located in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file) to point to another drive that has sufficient space.

<P><LI>Reduce the amount of memory allocated for Lotus 1-2-3 by adjusting
   the SET 123MEMSIZE statement to a lower value.

<P><LI>Back up and erase all nonessential files from the hard drive to
   provide more disk space for the swap file.
<P>
</OL><h3>VM error[26]</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   VM error[26]: Cannot create swap file. Make sure the
   123SWAPPATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file contains
   only existing directories and no diskette drives. "name=
   g:\XXXXXXXXX"

   (where XXXXXXXXX is a filename)

</PRE></OL>This indicates that Lotus has its swap file path set to a directory
that does not exist.
<P>
To work around the problem, set the SET 123SWAPPATH statement (located in
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file) to point to another drive that exists and has
sufficient disk space.
<P>
<P><h2>ENHANCED MODE</h2>
 
<P>
The following error message may be returned when Lotus 1-2-3 version
3.1 is run from Windows in enhanced mode:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot load driver file xxxx
   Cannot initialize resident segments
   (where xxxx refers to the driver filename)

</PRE>This indicates a low-memory situation and frequently occurs on
computers configured with two megabytes (MB) of RAM. Under these
circumstances, the following changes are recommended to ensure that
there is ample available memory to run Lotus 1-2-3.
<P>
To work around the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Remove or reduce the size of SMARTDrive. Normally, 2 MBs is not
   enough memory to load program code in physical memory if SMARTDrive
   consumes too much RAM. If there is insufficient physical RAM and/or
   insufficient swap file space, MS-DOS applications (that is, non-DPMI
   applications) will not be able to load into memory. It's better to
   run a program slower (that is, without caching support) rather than
   not having enough memory to run it at all.

<P><LI>Ensure that there is sufficient swap file space. For more
   information about swap file, query on:
<P>
<P><PRE>      enhanced and mode and 2 mb
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use the standard PIF settings from either the 123.PIF, supplied
   with Lotus, or the _DEFAULT.PIF, supplied with Windows. Lotus 1-2-3
   must have at least 64K of XMS memory available to run.

<P><LI>Verify that the SET statements included in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
   are correct. Because Lotus 1-2-3 3.1 has both DPMI and virtual
   memory support, optional SET statements can be added to adjust the
   program's memory usage. The SET 123MEMSIZE= statement (in the
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file) controls the total memory consumption (physical
   and virtual memory) by Lotus 1-2-3. This should not exceed the
   amount of memory available in Windows.
<P>
</OL>Please refer to the "Setting Up 1-2-3" section in the "Lotus User Manual"
for more information on configuration, syntax on SET statements, and
Windows-related issues.
