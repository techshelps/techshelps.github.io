       Questions and Answers: Special Video Driver Installation
       --------------------------------------------------------

1. Q. I have a high resolution or special video card and want to use
      its special features with Windows. How do I do this?

   A. Windows 3.0 includes driver software for standard video formats.
      For Windows to use the extra features of your special video
      card, you need software specifically written by the manufacturer
      to support those special features.

      Note: Unless you have this software from the video card
      manufacturer, Microsoft Product Support unfortunately will be
      unable to help you.

      There are three ways to obtain this software:

      a. Many special video cards, especially video cards purchased
         after June 1990, are sold with disks that include Windows 3.0
         drivers. Instructions for installing this software should
         come with the video card. Call your dealer or the video card
         manufacturer for assistance.

      b. Several companies have now provided Microsoft with their
         super VGA drivers. Microsoft makes these available on the
         Windows 3.0 Supplemental Driver Library (SDL) disks. To find
         out if drivers for your super VGA card are included, call
         Microsoft Customer Service at (800) 426-9400.

      c. If you don't have the proper Windows 3.0 driver now, and if
         it is not included in the Windows 3.0 Supplemental Driver
         Library, you will need to contact your dealer or the video
         card manufacturer for this software.

2. Q. I have a CGA graphics card but Windows 3.0 runs in black and
      white. Why is this?

   A. In graphics mode, Windows 3.0 must run in 640 x 200 or higher
      resolution. Under the official CGA standard, this mode is only
      black and white. If you have other programs that run in color,
      they are using a graphics mode not supported by Windows or they
      are using text mode.
