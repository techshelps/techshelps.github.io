The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Sitka TOPS is not a supported network by Microsoft Windows; however, it
may be possible to run Windows on the Sitka TOPS network. This article
discusses the following:

<UL><LI>Setup issues for Sitka TOPS with Windows
<LI>Software issues when running Sitka TOPS with Windows
<LI>Hardware issues when running Sitka TOPS with Windows
<P>
</UL><h2>SETUP ISSUES FOR SITKA TOPS WITH WINDOWS</h2>
 
<P>
On a Sitka TOPS network, programs cannot be executed from the server.
Therefore, it is not possible to perform a network installation of Windows
3.0 by running SETUP /N, or Windows 3.1 by running SETUP /A and SETUP /N.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
Set up Windows on the local hard drive.
<P>
<P><h2>SOFTWARE ISSUES WHEN RUNNING SITKA TOPS WITH WINDOWS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Network Connections</h3>
 
<P>
Any network connections (file servers, print servers, or network devices)
established before starting Windows are not recognized from within Windows
version 3.0, 3.0a, or 3.1. In general, those connections are available if
you exit Windows. You should always load Sitka NetPrint before starting
Windows. For more information on this limitation, contact Sitka TOPS
technical support.
<P>
<P><h3>Network Printing</h3>
 
<P>
Sitka does NOT recommend that you configure TOPS/DOS as a file server or
print server when using TOPS/DOS in the Windows 3.0 environment. Configure
TOPS/DOS as a Network Printer Client, Remote Printer Client or File Client
only. You must edit the TOPS.DAT file to increase the "Max number of open
files" setting (listed under the File Client parameters) to at least 20. If
you receive an error message indicating that your application "can't find a
.TMP file, insert disk in drive A," try setting the MS-DOS SET TEMP
variable in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to the remote drive letter.
<P>
Loading TOPS/DOS or NetPrint in conventional memory and Windows in standard
mode should work in most cases. You will not be able to run TOPS/DOS in
extended memory while Windows is running in 386 enhanced mode. The MS-DOS
extender program that TOPS/DOS 3.0 uses for extended memory is not
compatible with the Windows.
<P>
For more information about printing on the Sitka TOPS network, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   UNIX and CTRLD and TOPS

</PRE><h2>HARDWARE ISSUES WHEN RUNNING SITKA TOPS WITH WINDOWS</h2>
 
<P>
For the best results, use a TOPS-supported Ethernet card. With Windows in
enhanced mode, and to a lesser extent in standard mode, a TOPS FlashCard is
not serviced often enough to maintain network connections. The operation of
the TOPS FlashCard and driver is dependent upon standard servicing of
hardware interrupts. If you want to try using a FlashCard, make sure that
you configure the card and driver for DMA=NONE and BOARDINT=3. Also, be
advised that network activity may only work intermittently.
