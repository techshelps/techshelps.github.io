2.x 3.00 3.00a 3.10 3.11
WINDOWS
kberrmsg kbdisplay
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 2.x, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The "Divide by zero" error message is often caused by a command or a series
of commands that result in the mathematical division by zero, which is an
illegal operation. This error can also be triggered by other error
conditions, such as a quotient too large to fit in the designated register.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are possible causes of the "Divide By Zero" error when you
are running Windows:

<UL><LI>Memory-resident software of any kind.
<P>
   Remove all memory-resident software from your AUTOEXEC.BAT and
   CONFIG.SYS files. (Booting from an original MS-DOS floppy disk for
   testing purposes is helpful.)

<LI>Incompatible disk-partitioning software.
<P>
   Windows supports the use of the MS-DOS FDISK command to partition
   the hard disk. Third-party disk-partitioning programs (such as
   Golden Bow VFeature, Disk Manager, and SpeedStor) may cause problems.
   Contact the software manufacturer for information about Windows
   compatibility.

<LI>Improperly installed extended or expanded memory.
<P>
   Verify that your extended-memory board has the correct starting
   address and amount of memory set using its dip switches or jumpers.
   It may be set to overlap other memory in the system or to leave
   memory gaps.

<LI>Corrupted installation of Windows
<P>
   Boot from an original MS-DOS floppy disk, reinstall Windows from the
   original disks, and test. If the problem still occurs, you may have
   corrupted disks or a hardware incompatibility. Contact Microsoft
   Product Support Services for assistance at (425) 637-7098.

<LI>Incompatible caching or shadow RAM hardware.
<P>
   Disable your computers disk-caching and shadow-RAM features.

<LI>Corrupted, incompatible, or poorly written high-resolution video display
   drivers.
<P>
   To work around this problem, use the standard Windows or Windows for
   Workgroups VGA driver.
