The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the differences in the user interface (UI)
between Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 and Microsoft
Windows operating system version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Toolbars</h3>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups adds a toolbar to File Manager and Print
Manager.
<P>
Each toolbar contains a number of buttons that facilitate the most
common procedures. Windows for Workgroups displays an explanation of
each toolbar button and menu item on the status bar when you select
it. You can customize each toolbar.
<P>
<P><h3>File Manager</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The toolbar contains a list box for selecting a drive to display in
   the directory window.

<LI>The drive bar is located in the main File Manager window, providing
   more display area for files.

<LI>An option has been added that opens a new directory window when you
   connect to a network drive.

<LI>When you select a single file, its size, date, and time display on
   the status bar.

<LI>The Properties dialog box includes version stamp and copyright
   information. The Properties dialog box contains an Open By button
   that allows you to view users on the network who are currently
   accessing that file.

<LI>When you share a directory, its icon changes. When you select a
   shared directory, its network path displays on the status bar.

<LI>A directory window can exist for an unavailable drive; in 3.1,
   when you started File Manager, the only saved windows that were
   restored were ones on drives that actually existed.

<LI>The Tile command is expanded to Tile Horizontally or Tile
   Vertically.
<P>
</UL><h3>Print Manager</h3>
 

<UL><LI>A new display format allows more compact and flexible display of
   information.

<LI>When a printer is shared or connected, its network path is shown in
   the main display.

<LI>All jobs in a remote print queue are shown, not just those that
   belong to you.

<LI>The display font can now be customized.

<LI>The default printer can be set from within Print Manager, so you
   don't have to switch to Control Panel to set it.

<LI>You can insert a separator page before each print job.
<P>
</UL><h3>Control Panel</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The Network icon provides access to all Windows for Workgroups
   configuration settings.

<LI>The Printers icon only provides access to a Connect dialog box. You
   cannot disconnect from within the Printers window. You must use
   Print Manager instead. The Printers icon in Control Panel is
   primarily dedicated to set up and remove printers from your system.
<P>
</UL><h3>Connection UI (Both File Manager and Print Manager)</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Windows for Workgroups integrates browsing into the Connect Network
   Printer and Connect Network Drive dialog boxes, so you don't have
   to choose a separate button to browse. Similarly, the network Path
   drop-down list contains the last 12 network paths used, so you
   don't have to open a separate dialog box to browse that list.

<LI>The Drive or Device list displays all devices, including those that
   are already connected and what they are connected to. You can
   replace an existing connection with a new one without manually
   disconnecting first.

<LI>When Windows for Workgroups prompts you for a password, that
   password can be saved in a password list file (PWL) for later use.

<LI>On dual-network systems, you can choose a button that opens the
   secondary network's connect dialog box.

<LI>On dual-network systems, you can type a network path to the
   secondary network in the Windows for Workgroups Path field without
   having to use the secondary network's Connect dialog box.
<P>
</UL><h3>Disconnect UI (Both File Manager and Print Manager)</h3>
 

<UL><LI>You can select multiple drives for disconnecting at once.

<LI>On dual-network systems, both Windows for Workgroups and secondary-
   network connections can be disconnected using the same dialog box.
<P>
</UL><h3>Common Dialog Boxes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The common Open, Save As, and Print Setup dialog boxes contain a
   Network button that provides access to a Connect dialog box.

<LI>In the Open and Save As dialog boxes, you can type a share name in
   UNC (universal naming convention) format to access a list of files
   without explicitly connecting to that share.
<P>
</UL>Note to ISVs (independent software vendors): If a common dialog box
called by your application lacks a Network button, there may be a
control ID conflict (the ID is psh14), or there may not be enough room
in your custom dialog template for the button to fit. If, on a
dual-network system, the Connect dialog box lacks a NetWare button,
your application may have insufficient stack space to support the
NetWare connect dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Built-In Applications</h3>
 

<UL><LI>ClipBook Viewer replaces Clipboard Viewer.

<LI>New applications include WinMeter, Net Watcher, and Chat.
