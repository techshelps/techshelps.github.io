The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Windows or Windows for Workgroups from a Novell NetWare
workstation, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The NETWARE.DLL file cannot be located

</PRE>NOTE: There is no file named NETWARE.DLL that is used with Microsoft
Windows or Microsoft Windows for Workgroups; this error message is invalid.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The following are possible causes of and solutions to this error:

<UL><LI>The versions of NETX.COM and IPX.COM are incompatible. (For
   example, IPX.COM version 3.1 is incompatible with NETX.COM version
   3.22. To correct this problem, install NETX.COM version 3.26.)
<P>
   For more information on correct versions of IPX.COM and NETX.COM,
   query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      novell and driver and versions and windows and 3.1 and netx.com
</PRE>
<LI>The NETWARE.DRV file is corrupted. To correct this problem, remove
   and then re-expand the NETWARE.DRV file.

<LI>If you issue a LAPLINK command from a workstation that is set up
   for a Novell network to a workstation that is not, you may receive the
   above error. To eliminate it, run Windows Setup on the computer that
   is set up for a network and change the Network option to No Network.

<LI>If you are running the After Dark screen saver, manufactured by
   Berkeley Systems, you may receive the above error. To correct this
   problem, disable After Dark.

<LI>If you start FileMaker PRO for Windows, manufactured by Claris,
   while running Windows version 3.1 on a Novell NetWare network, you may
   receive the above error message. This problem is caused by using an
   incorrect installation of FileMaker PRO.
<P>
   According to Claris Technical Support, FileMaker PRO should be
   installed with a "clean boot" and without any virus-detection software
   running. Additionally, the Novell NetWare option must be selected if
   the workstation is attached to a Novell NetWare network. After
   installation, the original workstation configuration can be restored.
   For additional information, contact Claris Technical Support.

<LI>If you are running Intel Storage Express, you may encounter this error.
   To correct the problem, disable Storage Express.
