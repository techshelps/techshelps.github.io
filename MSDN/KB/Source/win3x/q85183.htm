</PRE>The enclosed WW0511 disk contains Panasonic 9-pin printer drivers to
be used with Windows version 3.0. These drivers support the Panasonic
KX-P1180 and KX-P1695 printers.
<P>
The following files are contained on the enclosed WW0511 disk:
<P>
<PRE>   DINSTALL.EXE
   PANSON9.INF
   PANSON9.DRV
   UNIDRV.DLL
   UNIDRV.HLP
   DMCOLOR.DLL
   README.TXT

</PRE><h3>Installing the Panasonic Printer Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
Included on this disk is a program called DINSTALL. It will search all
the directories listed in the PATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
for earlier versions of the printer driver and ask if you want to
delete the old driver and replace it with the updated printer driver.
To run DINSTALL, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Start Windows 3.0 if it is not already running.

<P><LI>Insert the enclosed WW0511 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive.

<P><LI>From Program Manager's File menu, choose Run.

<P><LI>In the Command Line box of the Run dialog box, type the path to
   DINSTALL.EXE on the floppy disk. For example, if the WW0511 disk is
   in drive A, type the following:  "a:\dinstall" (without the
   quotation marks). Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>This will load DINSTALL and bring up a Driver Install window. Using
   the mouse or keyboard, select the driver that you want to install
   and then choose the Install button.

<P><LI>If DINSTALL finds earlier versions of the driver, it will ask if
   you want to delete the old Panasonic drivers. Choose the Yes button
   to delete them. The old drivers will then be deleted and replaced
   with the updated printer drivers.

<P><LI>A DINSTALL Info dialog box will appear with the status of the new
   driver when the installation is complete. Choose the OK button to
   remove the dialog box and then choose the Exit button to leave the
   installation program.
<P>
</OL>The driver is now installed and you can configure it by choosing the
Printers icon from the Control Panel. For more information on
configuring printers for use with Windows, refer to pages 163-176 of
your version 3.0 "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
<P>
If DINSTALL does not work, you can install the drivers manually. For
information on installing the drivers manually, please read the
README.TXT file on the enclosed WW0511 disk.
