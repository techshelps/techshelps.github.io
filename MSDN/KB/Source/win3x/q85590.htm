The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a line is added to the SETUP.INF file in the [run] section to
launch a Windows-based application that is named SETUP.XXX, the line
is ignored by Windows Setup, regardless of where the file is located
(where XXX is the file's extension).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The [run] section of the SETUP.INF file is where you put any programs that
are to be run at the end of the Windows 3.1 Setup program. Even if a file
named SETUP.XXX is located on a network drive, or another directory on the
local PC, Windows Setup ignores the line in the SETUP.INF file in the [run]
section if the file is named SETUP.XXX.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem rename the file to something else. For Example,
adding any additional letter to the beginning of the name will permit
Windows Setup to launch the other Setup program. (For example, change the
name of Setup for Microsoft Word from SETUP.EXE to WSETUP.EXE.)
<P>
NOTE: The filename of INSTALL.XXX will execute correctly when listed in the
[run] section of the SETUP.INF file (where XXX is the file's extension).
