The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When creating a swap file, you may receive an error message similar to
the following:
<P>
<PRE>   The partitioning scheme used on your hard disk prevents the
   creation of a permanent swap file.

</PRE>This error message can display whether you use the Virtual Memory
dialog box during a custom Windows Setup, or the 386 Enhanced option
in Control Panel to create swap files.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This message can result from one of the following:

<UL><LI>A partition manager
<LI>A virus
<LI>Uninitialized fields in the partition table
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows is very careful about what hard disks it uses when it creates
permanent swap files. Windows would cause serious disk errors and data
loss if it incorrectly modified a disk that is formatted with special
software. To prevent damaged disks and lost data, Windows makes
absolutely sure that it understands the exact format of the disk.
<P>
One of the checks performed by Control Panel (and Setup, because Setup
uses Control Panel to create a swap file when a custom setup is
performed) is to look for disk partitioning software, such as Disk
Manager or SuperStor. This is done by examining the partition table on
the disk.
<P>
If partitioning software is found, Control Panel displays an error
message. This message does not imply that the partitioning software is
incompatible with Windows; it simply means that a permanent swap file
cannot be created on that disk.
<P>
The following conditions can cause Control Panel to mistakenly detect
partitioning software:

<UL><LI>Another operating system is installed on the computer and happens
   to use the same partition type number (there are only 255 partition
   type numbers available); that partition is detected as one using
   partitioning software. There is no way to work around this
   problem if this is the cause.

<LI>The machine is infected with a virus. Some viruses create their own
   "foreign" disk partitions and set themselves up as the boot
   operating system (for example, the Michelangelo virus). If no other
   explanation for the disk partition error can be found, the disk
   should be scanned for viruses. When the virus is removed, Windows
   should be able to create the permanent swap file.

<LI>The disk drive may have been partitioned in the past with
   partitioning software, and was later repartitioned using MS-DOS
   version 4.01 or 5.0 FDISK. MS-DOS and FDISK support only four
   partitions on a disk, while some partition software supports more
   than four. Therefore, FDISK does not reset partitions in the extra
   entries. As a result, Windows interprets these invalid entries
   as an incompatible disk partition.

<LI>Ontrack Software Disk Manager-N utility partitions and formats
   part of a hard drive as a Novell file server. When a machine
   configured with Disk Manager-N is started, the Novell utility
   attached to the master boot record (MBR) loads and gives you the
   option of starting the system on the MS-DOS partition or to the
   Novell file server partition. If your hard disk has been
   partitioned with Disk Manager-N, you cannot create a permanent
   swap file under Microsoft Windows 3.1.
<P>
   The following text was taken from the Disk Manager README file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DISK MANAGER - N
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      DISK MANAGER - N is a disk installation utility tailored
      specifically for the NOVELL local area network. This utility
      replaces the COMPSURF utility from NOVELL. DISK MANAGER - N
      installs disks running under NETWARE 86, ADVANCED NETWARE 86,
      and ADVANCED NETWARE 286.
