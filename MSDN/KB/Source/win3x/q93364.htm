1. Q. When I start File Manager, I receive the error message
      "Cannot read from drive I." After I choose the OK button to
      close the error message, File Manager displays all my drives,
      but I cannot access any files. What is causing this error?

   A. If you are using MS-DOS version 4.x, a file named GRAPHICS.COM
      may be causing this error. To correct this problem, open your
      AUTOEXEC.BAT file and try removing the command line that
      specifies GRAPHICS.COM. The MS-DOS version 5.0 GRAPHICS.COM file
      does not cause this problem.

2. Q. What should I do when I receive the "Inadequate DPMI server"
      error?

   A. The error message "Inadequate DPMI server" is displayed if the
      files KRNL386.EXE and WIN386.EXE are from different versions of
      Windows. (Specifically, the error message occurs if one file is
      from Windows 3.0 and the other is from 3.1.) To determine if
      this is causing the problem, check the dates on the KRNL386.EXE
      and WIN386.EXE files. These files are located in the
      WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. It is possible that older versions of
      these files may be in the PATH statement or in the WINDOWS
      directory; therefore, be sure to search all the directories
      listed in the PATH statement. If necessary, rename or delete old
      versions of these files and then use the EXPAND utility, which
      is located in the WINDOWS directory, to expand new copies of
      these files from the Windows Setup disks.

      The "Inadequate DPMI server" error message may also appear if
      your system memory-configuration settings do not match the
      amount of memory the system actually has. The setting changes
      necessary depend on the type of hardware you have. For more
      information about changing these settings, please refer to your
      hardware documentation.

3. Q. When I switch to the command prompt from Windows, I receive
      the error message "Incorrect system version. Please install the
      386 Enhanced section and run Setup again." What is causing this
      error and how can I correct it?

   A. This error can be caused by either of the following two
      conditions:

      1. An old WINOA386.MOD file is located in the WINDOWS
         directory or in the PATH statement. Delete the old file and
         use the EXPAND utility to expand an updated version from the
         Windows 3.1 disks by typing the following:

           EXPAND A:\WINOA386.MO_ C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WINOA386.MOD

      2. In the SYSTEM.INI file, three lines specify what kind of
         video driver Windows uses when running in 386 enhanced mode.
         These lines are 386Grabber=, display.drv= (both of these are
         located in the [boot] section), and display= (which is
         located in the [386Enh] section). The "Incorrect system
         version" error message usually occurs if one of these entries
         is not consistent with the others.

      To reset these drivers, use the following five steps:

      1. Quit Windows. Change to the WINDOWS directory.

      2. Type "setup" (without the quotation marks) and press
         ENTER.

      3. Select the current Display option and press ENTER.

      4. From the Display list box, select VGA (version 3 point 0)
         and press ENTER.

      5. If you are prompted to use an existing driver, press the
         ESC key to load new drivers. (When you press ESC, you are
         prompted to insert the appropriate Windows Setup disk.)

4. Q. Why do I receive the error message "Call to Undefined
      Dynalink" when I am running Windows?

   A. This error is usually caused by an outdated .DLL file located in
      the WINDOWS directory. The outdated file most often is
      TOOLHELP.DLL. To correct this problem, locate this file and
      rename it, then restart Windows. The correct version of
      TOOLHELP.DLL is located in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory, is
      dated 3/10/92, and has a size of 14,128 bytes. This problem can
      also occur with an earlier version of SHELL.DLL, OLECLI.DLL,
      OLESVR.DLL, and COMMDLG.DLL. All these files should be located
      in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory and should be dated 3/10/92.

      The "Call to Undefined Dynalink" error message is also commonly
      caused by installing an older version of PrinterControl Panel in
      Windows. To correct this problem, contact LaserTools Corporation
      to obtain an updated version of PrinterControl Panel or for
      information on removing PrinterControl Panel from Windows.
