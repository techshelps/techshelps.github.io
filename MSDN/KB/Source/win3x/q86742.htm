The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to use the Microsoft Mouse as a primary input device in
Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, but it is not recommended. This
configuration should be used only for development and limited testing
of Windows for Pen applications and drivers.
<P>
Currently, pen tablets/computers, drivers, and the retail version of
Windows for Pens are available only through OEMs (original equipment
manufacturers); therefore, the components necessary to use the Microsoft
Mouse as an inking device are only available with the Windows 3.1 SDK.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To get inking capabilities from the mouse, the mouse driver must be removed
(or replaced) and a tablet driver must be loaded. Microsoft has written two
drivers for this functionality: the YESMOUSE driver and the MSMOUSE driver.
The YESMOUSE driver is a replacement for the mouse driver that instructs
Windows to display a mouse cursor without loading any mouse driver. (Note
that tablet drivers do not display mouse cursors by default. The only way
to get a mouse cursor is if a mouse driver or YESMOUSE driver is loaded.)
The MSMOUSE driver is actually a tablet driver that is loaded as an
installable device driver.
<P>
To ink with the Microsoft Mouse, insert the following lines into the
appropriate sections of the SYSTEM.INI. Make sure that the files referenced
in those lines are present in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory or that the
full path to their location is specified:
<P>
<PRE>   [boot]
   mouse.drv=YESMOUSE.DRV

   [drivers]
   pen=MSMOUSE.DRV
</PRE>
