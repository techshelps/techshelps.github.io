The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When using File Manager included with Windows 3.0 or 3.0a, it is possible
to delete all data on a logical drive (either floppy or hard drive).
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur in later versions of Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: The following steps will delete all the data on your logical drive.
Be sure to back up your drive before performing these steps.

<OL><P><LI>Run File Manager and select the [..] entry in a directory one level
   down from the root.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Delete. Because [..] always refers to the
   parent directory, File Manager will interpret this as a request to
   delete everything on a logical drive, proceeding to delete all files
   and all subdirectories, and even IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS if these exist.
<P>
</OL><h3>Reasons for Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
This behavior can seemingly "spontaneously" happen if the following
circumstances apply:

<OL><P><LI>[..] was inadvertently highlighted prior to exercising the Delete
   command.

<P><LI>Confirm On Delete and Confirm On Subtree Delete are not selected in
   the dialog box that appears when you choose Confirmation from the
   Options menu.
<P>
<P><PRE>    File Manager would otherwise generate warnings about the deletions
    that would occur.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Safely Deleting All the Files in a Directory</h3>
 
<P>
From the File menu, choose Select All to select all of the files in a
directory. This command will not select the [..] entry.
