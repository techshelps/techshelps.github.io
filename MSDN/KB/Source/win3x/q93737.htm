The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses using OnTrack's Disk Manager version 5.1 with
Microsoft Windows version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Compatibility with SmartDrive version 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
According to OnTrack Technical Support, Disk Manager version 5.1 is
compatible with SmartDrive version 4.0, although there may be some problems
using it with SmartDrive's Double_Buffer command, depending upon your
hardware configuration:

<UL><LI>System with no SCSI adapter
<P>
   OnTrack recommends removing the DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE
   /DOUBLE_BUFFER line in the CONFIG.SYS on all systems that do not
   have a SCSI host adapter.

<LI>System with a SCSI adapter, but no drives with more than 1024 cylinders
<P>
   OnTrack recommends adding the line DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE
   /DOUBLE_BUFFER+ in order to support partitions larger than 32 MB
   with MS- DOS versions 3.3 and earlier. If the plus sign is omitted,
   SmartDrive will fail.

<LI>System with a SCSI adapter and drives with more than 1024 cylinders
<P>
   OnTrack recommends removing the SmartDrive DEVICE= statement (even
   if it is using the Double_Buffer command) in the CONFIG.SYS file on
   all systems with a SCSI adapter and drives with more than 1024
   cylinders. It should be noted that with this configuration Windows
   will not run in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
</UL><h3>Compatibility with Windows 3.1 Swap Files</h3>
 
<P>
According to OnTrack, Disk Manager 5.1 is compatible with Windows 3.1
swap files but you may be prevented from creating a permanent swap
file in the following situations:

<UL><LI>Head or sector-per-track mismatch (unless IDE)
<P>
   If the number of heads and sectors per track specified by your CMOS
   drive type entry does not match the actual number of heads and
   sectors per track of your drive, your configuration prevents the
   use of a permanent swap file. Resolving this conflict requires that
   you reinstall your drive and will likely result in lost disk space.
   If you must use a permanent swap file, OnTrack Technical Support
   can provide suggestions on reconfiguring your system to allow it.

<LI>Large partitions with MS-DOS version 3.3 and earlier
<P>
   If you are using MS-DOS 3.3 or earlier and have a partition larger
   than 32 MB, you cannot use a permanent swap file. To use a
   permanent swap file with your system, you must either upgrade to
   MS-DOS 4.0 or later and reinstall your system or make all
   partitions 32 MB or less and reinstall with your current version of
   MS-DOS.

<LI>Drives with more than 1024 cylinders
<P>
   Permanent swap files can be accessed by Windows only if they are
   created within the first 1024 cylinders of your drive. Make sure
   you create your swap file on a partition that contains 1024
   cylinders or less. Otherwise, Windows will issue a corrupt swap
   file error when started. If you have a drive with more than 1024
   cylinders, you need to manually enable permanent swap file support
   by modifying the DMDRVR device statement in your CONFIG.SYS file to
   include a /P option as shown below:
<P>
<P><PRE>      device=c:\dmdrvr.bin /p
</PRE><P>
</UL>If you have problems with corrupt swap file errors when using the /P
option, it is likely that your drive partition is not located within
the first 1024 cylinders.
