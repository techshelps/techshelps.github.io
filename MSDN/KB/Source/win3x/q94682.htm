The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows 3.1 COMM.DRV designed for external modems that are
connected to the on board serial port (COM1) may not work with early
models of the IBM PS/2 50Z. Windows may not be able to communicate
with the modem, or the computer may lock up.
<P>
The following information does not apply to internal modems because
they do not use the external serial port on the 50Z. They should work
with Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Early versions of the IBM PS/2 model 50Z may have shipped with ZM41
system boards that use a non-standard serial communications port.
<P>
At speeds less than 9600bps, the external (COM1) serial port may fail
with Windows 3.1 and other communications programs, including Autosig
for MS-DOS and the CompuServe Information Manager (CIM) for MS-DOS.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
As a possible workaround, you can try using the COMM.DRV driver for
Windows 3.0. If you have this driver available, install it as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Make a backup copy of the COMM.DRV that is located in your Windows
   system subdirectory.

<P><LI>Insert the Windows 3.0 disk that contains COMM.DR_ into a floppy
   disk drive. This file is located on disk 1 (5.25-inch high-density),
   disk 2 (3.5-inch low-density) or disk 4 (5.25-inch low-density).

<P><LI>Use the EXPAND command to expand the file to the hard disk. For
   example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      EXPAND A:COMM.DR_ c:\Windows\SYSTEM
</PRE><P>
</OL>For further information, please contact IBM.
