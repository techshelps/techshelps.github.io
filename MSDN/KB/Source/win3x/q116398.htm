The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains steps to remove the PrintCache utility from your
Windows configuration and suggestions for troubleshooting specific problems
related to using PrintCache in Windows. If you need additional assistance
with PrintCache, contact LaserTools Technical Support.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
LaserTools PrintCache versions 3.0 and 3.1 modify all installed printer
drivers to send their information to PrintCache's GDX.EXE instead of
Windows' GDI.EXE. It is sometimes necessary to disable PrintCache for
troubleshooting purposes.
<P>
NOTE: To use 32-bit file access (VFAT) in Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you
must disable PrintCache. If you install PrintCache and then start Windows
for Workgroups, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   32-Bit File Access was unable to run.
   This may be because you started the network before starting
   Windows, because Windows could not find the IFSHLP.SYS driver, or your
   hard disk(s) may be incompatible with 32-bit File Access.

</PRE><h3>Removing PrintCache</h3>
 
<P>
To remove PrintCache from Windows:

<OL><P><LI>Run INSTALL.EXE from the PCACHE directory and then press ENTER to
   continue.

<P><LI>Select the Windows Pcache option.

<P><LI>Choose Remove.

<P><LI>If you are using PrintCache version 3.1, also remove the Voice Warning
   option.

<P><LI>To complete the removal of PrintCache, exit and then restart Windows.
<P>
</OL>In some instances, this procedure may not completely remove the
modifications made to the printer drivers. In addition to running the
uninstall program, you may need to change to the PCACHE directory and type
the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   nogdx \windows\system\*.drv

</PRE></OL>This removes modifications made to the printer driver files in the Windows
SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
If this fails to repair the driver files, completely remove the printers
from the Printers dialog box in Control Panel, rename the printer driver(s)
in question, and then reinstall them from your original Windows disks.
<P>
<P><h3>Using PrintCache with Windows</h3>
 
<P>
When you use a PrintCache version earlier than 3.0 with Windows, you must
either clear the "Fast Printing Direct To Port" check box in the Connect
dialog box, or print to LPTx.xxx (any extension can be used). To access the
Connect dialog box, choose the Printers icon in Control Panel, and choose
Connect.
<P>
With PrintCache version 3.0, you do not need to disable "Fast Printing
Direct To Port" because PrintCache 3.0 has a Windows installation utility
and dynamic-link library (DLL) that handle routing data to the printer
while taking advantage of MS-DOS interrupts. In both cases, because
PrintCache is handling the MS-DOS interrupts, no performance degradation
results from clearing the Fast Print Direct To Port option. Also, when you
are using PrintCache with Windows version 3.0, you must choose the 386
Enhanced icon in Control Panel and select the Never Warn option under
Device Contention. If Device Contention is not set to Never Warn, you
receive a "Device Conflict" error when you print.
<P>
In PrintCache versions earlier than 3.0, if LPTx.xxx is not selected,
Windows 3.0 bypasses the PrintCache buffer and prints directly to the
parallel port.
<P>
PrintCache is manufactured by LaserTools, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
