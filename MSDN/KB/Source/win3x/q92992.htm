The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1.
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Thomas Conrad TC5043 series of network adapters are built to be 100-
percent compatible with the Novell NE1000 and NE2000 network interface
cards.
<P>
The NDIS driver provided with Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) does not
function properly with revision A of this board when operating in NE2000
compatibility mode. Thomas Conrad now has ROM upgrade that works with one
version of this board.
<P>
As a temporary workaround for this problem, place the adapter in NE1000
compatibility mode and then use the NE1000 NDIS driver from Windows for
Workgroups.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Thomas Conrad has confirmed this to be a problem with revision A of this
series of network adapters. For additional information, contact Thomas
Conrad technical support.
<P>
You can determine the revision number of the TC5043 series adapters by
examining the Serial number on the back edge of the network adapter. The
revision letter is located at the end of the serial number.
<P>
<P><h3>Updated ROM</h3>
 
<P>
Thomas Conrad has an updated ROM for the TC5043 that allows the board to
operate as fully NE2000-compatible. The problem with revision A of this
board resulted from 2 bytes of code that had to be corrected in their ROM.
<P>
Contact Thomas Conrad technical support to obtain this ROM update.
<P>
NOTE: There are two versions of the TC5043: one uses SMT (Surface Mount
Technology) and one uses the standard DIP (Dual Inline Package) technology.
The SMT boards CANNOT be upgraded, since the ROM is not a removable chip.
The cards that can be upgraded have the ROM chip in a socket on the left
side of the card, just above center. The ROM has a white sticker on it with
a number. Thomas Conrad needs this number when you request your update.
<P>
The TC5043 series of network adapters are manufactured by Thomas Conrad, a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
