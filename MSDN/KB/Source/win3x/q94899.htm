The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
Microsoft has tested Windows for Workgroups with versions 3.3 and
later of Microsoft MS-DOS and PC-DOS. Microsoft does not recommend or
support running Windows or Windows for Workgroups with Digital
Research DOS (DR-DOS).
<P>
IMPORTANT: Read these instructions before proceeding. Microsoft cannot
guarantee this procedure will work in every situation. If this
procedure fails, you must reinstall Windows 3.1 and Windows-based
applications to a new directory.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Windows for Workgroups on a computer running DR-DOS
version 6.0, the system may stop responding (hang) while loading the
protocol manager, PROTMAN.DOS. If the problem occurs and Windows for
Workgroups was installed over Windows 3.1, use the following
procedures to return to Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: This procedure can be used ONLY if the Setup program for Windows for
Workgroups was run one time. If the Setup program was run more than once,
it is not possible to restore the original Windows configuration files and
therefore Windows 3.1 must be reinstalled to an empty subdirectory.
Additionally, any third-party software that replaces Windows virtual device
drivers (VxDs) may need to be reinstalled after reinstalling Windows 3.1.

<OL><P><LI>Start up the machine with DR-DOS 6.0 from the DR-DOS startup disk. DR-
   DOS immediately runs a batch file. Press CTRL+C (or CTRL+BREAK) to stop
   the batch file. The A&gt; prompt appears.

<P><LI>Edit the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to remove the Windows for
   Workgroups network device drivers. These drivers are PROTMAN.DOS,
   WORKGRP.SYS, and the network interface card driver (media access
   control [MAC] driver). If NetWare connectivity has been added, also
   remove the referenced lines.
<P>
<P><PRE>    Below is an example of lines to remove:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       CONFIG.SYS
       ----------
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\PROTMAN.DOS /I:C:\WINDOWS
       DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\WORKGRP.SYS
<PRE></PRE>       DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EXP16.DOS   ;or other specific MAC driver
       DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\MSIPX.SYS   ;if NetWare Connectivity added

       AUTOEXEC.BAT
       ------------

       C:\WINDOWS\NET START
       C:\WINDOWS\MSIPX    ;if NetWare Connectivity added
       C:\WINDOWS\NETX     ;if NetWare Connectivity added

</PRE><P><LI>Copy the files WININI.W31 and SYSINI.W31 to a floppy disk. These files
   should be located in the WINDOWS directory.

<P><LI>Run the Windows version 3.1 Setup program. Choose the Custom Setup
   button. A blue screen will appear stating that setup has found a
   previous version of Microsoft Windows on your system and recommends
   that you perform an upgrade. Specify the Windows for Workgroups
   directory as the target directory and press ENTER to upgrade. When the
   System Information screen appears, change the line
<P>
<P><PRE>       Network = Windows for Workgroups (version 3.1)
</PRE><P>
   to:
<P>
<P><PRE>       Network = No Network Installed (or the specific network in use)
</PRE><P>
   The Windows 3.1 Setup program detects some newer drivers (for example,
   COMM.DRV) and prompts you to replace them with the ones from Windows
   3.1. In the following example, Setup detects conflicts between the
   version of COMM.DRV currently on your system and the version that Setup
   is attempting to copy. You can choose to use the currently installed
   file or replace it with the file Setup is trying to copy.
<P>
   Example
   -------
<P>
<PRE>       Current file : Version 3.10a   Language: U.S. English
                     220800 bytes           10/1/92  3:11
       Proposed file: Version 3.10    Language: U.S. English
                     220800 bytes           03/10/92 3:10

   The replacement file is an older version than your current file.

    - To keep your currently installed driver file, press ENTER.
    - To replace the currently installed driver file, press ESC.

   At this point, each driver file should be replaced by pressing the ESC
   key.

   After Setup loads Windows, the Setup program begins to copy files,
   again finding newer versions than those provided with Windows 3.1.
   Setup prompts for action on each conflicting file as follows:

   The following file conflicts with the version already on your system:

       File: CLIPBRD.EXE

       Description: Windows for Workgroups

       The new version of the file ((Unknown)) you are trying to install is
       older than the currently installed version (3.10a).

       Do you want to replace the file that is already on your system?

          Yes      Help        No

   Replace these files by selecting the Yes option. Setup finds version
   conflicts with the following files:

       COMM.DRV
       DDEML.DLL
       GDI.EXE
       MAIN.CPL
       USER.EXE
       PRINTMAN.CPL
       WINFILE.EXE
       SHELL.DLL
       COMMDLG.DLL
       CLIPBRD.EXE

</PRE><P><LI>From the floppy disk used in step 3, copy WININI.W31 to the WINDOWS
   directory as WIN.INI and SYSINI.W31 to the WINDOWS directory as
   SYSTEM.INI.

<P><LI>Reboot the system, and start Windows 3.1 by typing WIN at the command
   prompt and pressing ENTER.

<P><LI>Remove the program icons that were added by the Windows for Workgroups
   Setup program.
<P>
   Delete the following icons from the Main Group:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Clipbook Viewer
      Mail
      Schedule+
</PRE><P>
   Delete the following icons from the Accessories group:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Chat
      WinMeter
      Net Watcher
</PRE><P>
   Delete the following icons from the Games Group:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Hearts
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove the files from the WINDOWS directory and the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
   subdirectory that are specific to Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
   Files in the WINDOWS directory to delete:
<P>
<PRE>   CARDS.DLL     IMPEXP.DLL    MSSCHED.DLL  NDDENB.DLL    SCHEDMSG.DLL
   TRNSCHED.DLL  WGPOMGR.DLL   CLIPSRV.EXE  MSHEARTS.EXE  MSMAIL.EXE

   SCHDPLUS.HLP  WINCHAT.HLP   WFWNET.HLP   NET.MSG       NETH.MSG
   RINGIN.WAV    RINGOUT.WAV

   Files in the SYSTEM directory to delete:

   WFWSETUP.CPL  VBROWSE.386   VCD.386      VDMAD.386     VNB.386
   VNETBIOS.386  VNETSUP.386   VPD.386      VPICD.386     VREDIR.386
   VSERVER.386   VSHARE.386    VWC.386      AB.DLL        COMMCTRL.DLL

   WFWNET.DRV    MAILSPL.EXE   NETWORK.INF  MIDIMAP.OLD   LM21DRV.UPD

</PRE></OL>After performing these steps, Windows 3.1 should be successfully
reinstalled. However, if Windows 3.1 does not perform as expected, you must
reinstall Windows 3.1 and all Windows-based software to a new subdirectory.
