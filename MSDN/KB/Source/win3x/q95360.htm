The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You are unable to log on to the Banyan VINES network from the
Windows for Workgroups directory, but can log on from the Banyan
directory.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may be experiencing problems with the default workstation
environment settings in the PCCONFIG.DB file in your Windows for
Workgroups directory.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, run PCCONFIG.EXE from the Windows for
Workgroups directory, and set your default environment settings to the
same values as those in the PCCONFIG.DB file in the Banyan directory.
<P>
NOTE: If you have had three unsuccessful log on attempts, reboot your
computer. Banyan VINES networks require you to reboot the computer
after three unsuccessful log on attempts.
<P>
Follow these steps to resolve the problem:

<OL><P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt from your Windows for Workgroups directory,
   type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      PCCONFIG
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select the Login Environment Settings option.

<P><LI>Select the Edit/View Login Group Search List option.

<P><LI>You are prompted for a Login Group Search List. Enter the Group you
   belong to, an At Sign (@), then the Organization that your group
   resides in.
<P>
   For example, if your group is "Composers" and your organization is
   "Music," type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Composers@Music
</PRE>
<P><LI>Press the F10 key until you return to the MS-DOS prompt.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
</OL>This change allows you to access your network by typing only a user
name or nickname, instead of the full path. A nickname in Banyan VINES
is a symbolic link to a full text string, such as your full User name.
For example, "Bob" might be a nickname standing for "Bob
Brown@Composers@Music."
