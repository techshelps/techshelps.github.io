The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Certain hardware revisions of the AST Premium/286 computer are required for
proper operation under Microsoft Windows in standard mode, and under
enhanced mode on machines using the FAST BOARD 80386 upgrade. If a system
does not have the proper revisions, the following problems may result.
<P>
<P><h3>Standard Mode</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Keyboard lockup, erratic or slow keyboard input, and system locks
   when key is pressed
<LI>Unrecoverable Application Errors (UAEs) in 3.0; general protection
   (GP) fault error in 3.1
<LI>Network read/write errors
<LI>Video problems
<P>
</UL><h3>Enhanced Mode</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Problems using FAST BOARD 80386 upgrade
<P>
</UL>This article contains detailed technical information on the hardware
revisions required. This information is intended for persons familiar with
microcomputer repair and maintenance. If you do not feel comfortable
partially dismantling your computer, refer this information to a qualified
service person. These problems are not specific to Windows, but occur in
other protected-mode applications such as Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.x.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>KEYBOARD PROBLEMS OR UAEs/GP FAULTS IN STANDARD MODE</h3>
 
<P>
To prevent these problems, the following chip revisions are required:
<P>
<P><h3>System Board ROM BIOS:</h3>
 
<P>
AST BIOS - version 2.0
AST Phoenix BIOS - version 3.03
<P>
These chips are located at system board locations U10 (odd) and U12
(even). The AST part numbers are 107000-656 (odd) and 107000-657
(even). They are also included in the comprehensive AST Premium/286
BIOS Upgrade Kit (see below).
<P>
<P><h3>System Board Keyboard Controller</h3>
 
<P>
The Keyboard controller chip (located at system board location U50)
should have AST part number 107000-669 on the chip label. This
keyboard controller is also included in the AST Premium/286 BIOS
Upgrade Kit described below.
<P>
<P><h3>Keyboard ROM BIOS</h3>
 
<P>
The Keyboard ROM BIOS (located on the keyboard itself) should be AST
part number 107210-008. The proper version of this chip is included in
the AST BIOS upgrade kit (see below).
<P>
<P><h3>AST Premium/286 Comprehensive BIOS Upgrade Kit</h3>
 
<P>
All of the chip updates specified above are included in the AST BIOS
upgrade kit, which is AST part number 500529-001 (101-key keyboards) or
500529-002 (102-key keyboards).
<P>
<P><h3>NETWORK READ ERRORS IN STANDARD MODE</h3>
 
<P>
Some Premium/286 systems will exhibit network read/write errors,
especially during large data transfers (2MB-6MB in size). Errors
displayed by Windows may include the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot read from device NETWORK
   Cannot write to device NETWORK
   Network Error on drive x:

</PRE>This problem occurs even at the MS-DOS level outside of Windows, but
will happen more often under Windows because of the large data
transfers frequently requested by the environment.
<P>
These symptoms are caused by a problem found in a particular release
of the interrupt controller chips used on some Premium/286
motherboards. The interrupt controllers are soldered to the
motherboard at locations U25 and U26. This affects Premium/286
motherboard part numbers 202143-004 and 202322-001.
<P>
The chips in question are Toshiba 82C59 Interrupt Controllers, release
A. They may be identified by the large letter "T" and the word
"JAPAN", followed by an "xxxxEAI" code (for example, "8822EAI"). If an
EAI code is present, these chips must be replaced by an authorized AST
service center.
<P>
NOTE: If an AST Premium/286 is used as the server, it must also be
inspected for the proper interrupt controller revision.
<P>
If any of the following network cards are used in a Premium/286, there
may be some hardware compatibility issues. Contact AST Technical
Support for further information.
<P>
<PRE>   Novell NE1000
   Western Digital Ethernet
   Gateway Ethernet
   IBM Token Ring

</PRE><h3>VIDEO PROBLEMS IN STANDARD MODE</h3>
 
<P>
If an AST VGA adapter is used, a VGA card BIOS upgrade may be required
for proper operation. Everex EV-678 display cards may cause
compatibility problems. Contact AST Technical Support for further
information.
<P>
<P><h3>ENHANCED MODE PROBLEMS USING FAST BOARD 80386 UPGRADE</h3>
 
<P>
AST Premium/286 machines using this 386 upgrade require AST BIOS
version 2.0 or later to run Windows in enhanced mode. Machines with
the earlier AST BIOS or AST Phoenix BIOS may not be able to run
Windows in 386-enhanced mode. The BIOS upgrades are AST part numbers
107000-656 (odd) and 107000-657 (even), and are included with the AST
BIOS Upgrade Kit described above.
