<P><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
When you use the Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 IBMTOK.386
driver, you may experience the following problems:

<UL><LI>A stack overflow error message occurs when you exit Windows for
   Workgroups.

<LI>Your system stops responding (hangs) when you exit Windows for
   Workgroups.
<P>
</UL>The WG0988 disk included with this Application Note contains a new
IBMTOK.386 driver to correct these problems. The new driver allows the
MCA IBM(R) token ring card to correctly disengage from the network
ring when the network interface card (NIC) is set for IRQ 2.
<P>
<P><h3>To install the new IBMTOK.386 file</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>Make a backup copy of the currently installed IBMTOK.386 file by
   typing the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then pressing
   ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;path&gt;\ibmtok.386 ibmtok.old
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;path&gt; is the location of your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory.
<P>
   For example, if your Windows directory is called WINDOWS and is on
   drive C, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
   press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren c:\windows\system\ibmtok.386 ibmtok.old
</PRE>
<P><LI>Insert the enclosed WG0988 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive.

<P><LI>To copy the file to the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, type the
   following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\ibmtok.386 &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the WG0988 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory of your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory.
<P>
   For example, if the WG0988 disk is in drive A and your Windows
   directory is called WINDOWS and is on drive C, type the following
   at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\ibmtok.386 c:\windows\system
</PRE><P>
