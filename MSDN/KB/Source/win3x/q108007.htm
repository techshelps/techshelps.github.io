The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Wollongong Group's Pathway Runtime and Pathway Access version 1.2,
which comes with an RFC-compliant NetBIOS interface, can be used with
Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Pathway Runtime is the Wollongong TCP/IP
stack, and Pathway Access is a set of TCP/IP utilities provided by
Wollongong. (The TCP/IP stack is a real-mode stack and operates with NDIS 2
drivers.)
<P>
This article provides the steps needed to install Pathway Runtime 1.2 on
Windows for Workgroups 3.11.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To install Pathway Runtime on Windows for Workgroups, do the following:
<P>
WARNING: Although this procedure allows you to run Pathway Runtime with
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, it disables the NetBEUI protocol. As a
result, your machine won't be able to view or access any other Windows for
Workgroups machines or LAN Manager servers on the network that are running
NetBEUI exclusively.

<OL><P><LI>Install Windows for Workgroups with the default NetBEUI transport.

<P><LI>Install Pathway Runtime using PWSETUP.EXE from the setup disk supplied
   with the Wollongong product.

<P><LI>Complete the installation using the complete NDIS installation option.
   (For more information, please refer to the Pathway Runtime manual.)

<P><LI>After the installation is complete, change the AUTOEXEC.BAT file so
   that the NET INIT command is executed immediately before the NDIS
   command. Replace the PWBIND command with the NET START NETBIND command,
   which comes before the PWTCP command. Remove the NET START line added
   by Windows for Workgroups. The following is an example of the
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file after these changes:
<P>
</OL>rem #----------------------- The Wollongong Group --------------------#
rem # The following lines are for Pathway Runtime setup. Please DO NOT#
rem # modify or remove any of them. If you DO want to, please run the #
<PRE>rem # setup program to modify or deinstall Pathway for DOS.           #

</PRE></OL>SET PATH=C:\PATHWAY;%PATH%
c:\pathway\PWCONFIG -N:65
net init
c:\pathway\ndis -I:5 -D:3
net start netbind
rem if you are not using the bootp protocol comment out the bootp line.
c:\pathway\bootp -d
c:\pathway\pwtcp
c:\pathway\netbios
rem #----------------------- The Wollongong Group --------------------#

<OL><P><LI>Make sure that the -I option for the NDIS command matches the IRQ being
   used by the network card. The -D option refers to the section number in
   the PROTOCOL.INI file referring to the network card.

<P><LI>Run NETBIOS.EXE after PWTCP.EXE. (NETBIOS.EXE is the RFC-compliant
   driver.)

<P><LI>Edit the SYSTEM.INI file in the Windows directory and make the
   following changes:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. In the [386enh] section, change the line
</PRE><P>
<PRE>          transport=netbeui.386,nwlink.386,nwnblink.386

       to:

          transport=nwlink.386,nwnblink.386

    b. In the [network drivers] section, change the lines

          transport=ndishlp.sys,*netbeui
          LoadRMDrivers=No

       to:

          transport=ndishlp.sys
          LoadRMDrivers=Yes

</PRE></OL>These changes indicate that the real-mode protocol stack will use Lana 0.
(Pathway Runtime can use Lana 0 only).

<OL><P><LI>Edit the CONFIG.SYS file and remark out (using the REM command) the
   entries added by the Pathway Access installation program:
<P>
   rem #---------------------- The Wollongong Group ----------------------#
   rem #  The following lines are for Pathway Runtime setup. Please DO NOT#
   rem #  modify or remove any of them. If you DO want to, please run the#
<PRE>   rem #  setup program to modify or deinstall Pathway for DOS.          #
   rem DEVICE=C:\PATHWAY\PROTMAN.EXE /i:C:\PATHWAY\LANMAN
   rem DEVICE=C:\PATHWAY\LANMAN\ELNK3.DOS
   rem #---------------------- The Wollongong Group ---------------------#

   The only entry needed is:

      Device=c:\Windows\ifshlp.sys

</PRE><P><LI>Reboot and start Windows.
<P>
</OL>You can now install Pathway Access by following the instructions provided
by Wollongong.
