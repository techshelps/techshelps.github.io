The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
Terminal program, you have problems connecting to the modem, or you receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The COM&lt;x&gt; port is currently assigned to a MS-DOS application.
   Do you want to reassign the port to Windows?

</PRE>You may also have difficulty attaching to the modem through other Windows-
based communications packages, or your mouse (or other serial device) may
not operate properly in Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Most problems associated with the serial ports occur when a machine does
not recognize that it has the specified communications (COM) port
available.
<P>
Windows supports the use of COM ports 3 and 4, although the following steps
may be necessary to make them accessible. For example, if your mouse is not
working in Windows, or you cannot access your modem through Windows, you
may need to rewrite the BIOS Data Area for your serial ports. By placing an
address for each serial port in a Debug script file, you can ensure future
compatibility if you add or remove a device. (Creating a Debug script file
should not be required for Windows for Workgroups 3.11.)
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>When you troubleshoot communications problems in Windows, an MS-DOS-
   level communications program is often required to test the modem and
   ports outside Windows.
<P>
   If an MS-DOS-based application cannot be used, you can test the modem
   connections by typing the following command at the MS-DOS command prompt
   outside Windows
<P>
<P><PRE>      Echo ATDT &gt; COMx
</PRE><P>
   where "x" represents the COM port in question.
<P>
   The modem should respond with a dial-tone or just a communication
   signal.
<P>
   To stop the dial tone, type
<P>
   Echo ATH0 &gt; COMx
<P>
   where "x" represents the COM port in question.
<P>
   The ATDT command is a signal to the modem that is interpreted as
   Attention Dial Tone. The first command, Attention, signals to the
   modem that it is about to receive information, and the Dial Tone
   command instructs the modem to enable a line to dial out.
<P>
   NOTE: The modem may not always give a dial tone with this test
   procedure because a number does not follow the command; however,
   the modem should give some kind of signal that information was
   received.

<P><LI>To determine if your machine is recognizing the existence of the
   COM port your modem or mouse is on, do the following:
<P>
   a. Use the MS-DOS DEBUG command to look at the BIOS table.
<P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: You may also run the Microsoft Diagnostics utility (MSD).
</PRE><P>
   b. Quit Windows. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type:
<P>
<PRE>         debug

      This returns a hyphen prompt (-).

   c. At the hyphen prompt, type:

         d40:0

      This returns a listing of the BIOS data and the hyphen prompt.

      NOTE: After you review the table, you can type "Q" (without the
      quotation marks) to quit Debug.

   d. Look at the table of data on the screen. The first row is the
      important one. It shows a line resembling the following:

      0040:0000  F8 03 F8 02 E8 03 00 00-78 03 00 00 00 00 00 00

      All values to the left of the hyphen are COM ports; all values
      to the right are LPT ports. The example above shows that the
      computer has COM1 at address 03F8 (it is listed in reverse byte
      order), COM2 at 02F8, and COM3 at 03E8. COM4 is not found;
      therefore, 0000 is displayed just to the left of the hyphen. If
      the machine does not recognize the COM port desired to be used
      by Terminal (identified by the 0000 entries), continue as
      follows. If the machine does recognize the desired COM port,
      skip to the "SYSTEM.INI Modifications" section below in this
      article.

</PRE><P><LI>The following instructions help you write the Debug script and
   place it in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
   a. Use a text editor such as Microsoft Windows Notepad and create
<P><PRE>      the following file:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         E40:0
         F8 03 F8 02 E8 03 E8 02
         q

      NOTE: You must follow the "Q" with a carriage return (press ENTER).

   b. Save the three-line file, and give it a name such as:

         c:\fixcom.deb.

   c. Execute the Debug script file by typing the following at an
      MS-DOS command prompt outside Windows:

         debug &lt; fixcom.deb &gt; nul


   d. If the step above works correctly, add a line to the end of the
      AUTOEXEC.BAT file (but before launching Windows), such as the
      following:

         debug &lt; fixcom.deb &gt; nul

      NOTE: The &gt; NUL ending is just to keep the script from being
      echoed back to the screen. You can use Debug again to look at
      d40:0 and see if the change took effect.

   e. Save the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and reboot the machine.

   This procedure should work even if the machine does not have
   devices on all four serial ports. This also corrects problems if a
   device has been removed from COM1 and the addresses have slid down,
   which may cause mouse problems.

   You should now be able to run MSD or Debug and see all four COM
   ports.

</PRE></OL><h3>SYSTEM.INI Modifications</h3>
 
<P>
If the port is recognized by the machine, note the address that is listed
when using Debug, and, for Windows 3.0 and 3.0a, edit the SYSTEM.INI file
and include the following COMxBase= lines to coincide with the base I/O
address used by the hardware. The examples given above for COM1 and COM2 do
not require any changes to the SYSTEM.INI file. If you are using Windows
3.0, the examples given below for COM3 and COM4 require the following
entries in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   COMxBase Setting                Windows 3.0 Default
   ---------------------------------------------------

   COM1Base=3F8h                   &lt;default is 3F8h&gt;
   COM2Base=2F8h                   &lt;default is 2F8h&gt;
   COM3Base=3E8h                   &lt;default is 2E8h&gt;
   COM4Base=2E8h                   &lt;default is 2E0h&gt;

</PRE>For Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and 3.11, choose the Ports
icon in Control Panel to set the base I/O address and interrupt for each
COM port instead of editing the SYSTEM.INI file.(This is the only step
required for Windows for Workgroups 3.11.)
<P>
The defaults for Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.x are:
<P>
<PRE>   COM1Base=3F8h                   &lt;default is 3F8h&gt;
   COM2Base=2F8h                   &lt;default is 2F8h&gt;
   COM3Base=3E8h                   &lt;default is 3E8h&gt;
   COM4Base=2E8h                   &lt;default is 2E8h&gt;

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using a serial mouse on COM1 and you have an internal modem on
COM3, this configuration may not work because the mouse is using the
interrupt that COM3 wants to share. This behavior also occurs if you are
using a serial mouse on COM2 and want to use an internal modem on COM4.
This configuration is more likely to work on machines that allow for IRQ
sharing (such as Micro Channel Architecture [MCA] computers).
<P>
If COM3 is required, it should be reconfigured at the board level to
use a different interrupt that is free, such as IRQ 5.
