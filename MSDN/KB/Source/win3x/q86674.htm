The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the following error message during Windows Setup or when
running MS-DOS-based applications in standard or 386 enhanced mode:
<P>
<PRE>   Standard mode switcher is not running

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Problem Occurs During Setup</h3>
 
<P>
If any programs are placed below the [run] section in the SETUP.INF file,
Windows Setup starts the application after completing the installation of
Windows. If an entry for an MS-DOS-based application appears here, you will
receive the error message noted above.
<P>
MS-DOS-based applications cannot be run if standard-mode Switcher
(DSWAP.EXE) is not loaded. WIN.COM starts DSWAP.EXE, so when Windows is
started, you can run MS-DOS-based applications. Because the graphical
portion of Windows Setup is started by DOSX.EXE, not WIN.COM, DSWAP.EXE is
not loaded during Setup.
<P>
<P><h3>Problem Occurs When You Run MS-DOS-Based Applications</h3>
 
<P>
If the problem occurs when running an MS-DOS-based application or MS-DOS
Prompt, you will need to re-create WIN.COM.
<P>
The standard-mode Switcher (DSWAP.EXE) is initialized by WIN.COM when you
start Windows. If WIN.COM is corrupted or damaged, DSWAP.EXE may not be
initialized properly. If DSWAP.EXE is not loaded, or is loaded incorrectly,
you will get the error message noted above.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Re-creating WIN.COM</h3>
 
<P>
You can re-create WIN.COM by reinstalling Windows, or by selecting a
different video driver and then switching back to the original. To
cause WIN.COM to be updated by switching video drivers:

<OL><P><LI>Run Windows Setup from MS-DOS Prompt at the WINDOWS directory.

<P><LI>Change the Display to a different resolution, usually the next
   lowest option. For example, if you are using VGA, install for EGA.
   The resolution you choose does not matter because you will not
   actually be running Windows with the driver.

<P><LI>Follow the instruction on the screen to install the new display
   driver.

<P><LI>Run Windows Setup again.

<P><LI>Change the Display back to its original setting.
<P>
</OL>When you change the Display setting, WIN.COM is re-created. The
disadvantage of this procedure is the additional video driver and font
files will remain on your hard drive in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory,
unless you manually delete them.
<P>
