The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
 
<P>
This article contains information about the use of Windows for Workgroups
with third-party products or configurations that have not been tested and
are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With Windows for Workgroups 3.11, RPRINTER (or NPRINTER in Novell NetWare
4.01) can be used successfully under certain conditions. If you run the
RPRINTER utility without print sharing, RPRINTER, Windows for Workgroups
3.11, and NetWare 3.x or 4.x can coexist with minimal difficulty, as long
as you do not send simultaneous print jobs. Problems may occur if multiple
print jobs are sent from different workstations and you are sharing
printers. On larger networks, this is not realistic. The only workaround is
to use Windows for Workgroups print- sharing capabilities without RPRINTER
or vice versa.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: With Windows for Workgroups 3.1, RPRINTER could not be used
   successfully. According to Novell's Tech Bulletin TB.P.303, titled
   "Microsoft Windows for Workgroups and Novell NetWare," using RPRINTER
   with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 would cause the machine to stop
   responding (hang). Novell has no solution or workaround at this time.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Although you can use RPRINTER with Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you may
encounter problems. For example, if you share a local printer that is being
serviced by RPRINTER and several Windows for Workgroups workstations send
multiple print jobs simultaneously to this shared printer, the following
error message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Windows File Server&gt; is attempting to use the LPTx device which Windows
   is currently using. Do you want 'Windows File Server' to take control of
   the device?

   YES or NO?

</PRE>If you respond YES, the jobs queued in Print Manager should continue
printing, followed by those in the NetWare queue; however, choosing YES
causes the screen to turn black (and remain so after the print jobs have
been completed). Pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL and then ESC may restore the video
display.
<P>
Even if you don't receive this error message, print jobs may be mixed
together and/or have garbled output from the two separate print queues.
<P>
NOTE: This error message may also appear if you are you use the NPRINTER
file in Novell version 4.01.
