<OL><P><LI>Above Board 286 and Above Board Plus Installation
<P><PRE>    Programs
</OL></PRE> 
<P>
CAUTION: The Intel Above Board installation program that
<PRE>         shipped before May 1989 tests extended memory in a
         way that can corrupt extended memory.

</PRE></OL>Before using an Above Board installation program prior to
May 1989, make sure you haven't loaded software such as
SMARTDrive or RAMDrive that uses extended memory.  After the
Above Board has been installed, other software using
extended memory is unaffected.

<OL><P><LI>AutoCAD
</OL> 
To run AutoCAD release 10 and 11 (AutoCad 386) with MS-DOS,
contact Autodesk.

<OL><P><LI>AUTORUN.EXE
</OL> 
If you can't use Mountain Network Solutions AUTORUN.EXE, a
tape-drive backup program, contact your vendor for an
upgrade.

<OL><P><LI>CodeView
</OL> 
CAUTION: Using versions 3.0 to 3.13 of the CodeView CV.EXE
file may cause data loss if your system has a 80386 memory
manager (such as EMM386.EXE) and device drivers or programs
that use extended memory. To determine which version you
have, type CV.EXE at the command prompt.
<P>
To start CodeView versions 3.0 to 3.13 safely, use the
CV.COM file included with MS-DOS 5.0, and HIMEM.SYS version
2.77 or later.
<P>
To use the CV.COM file included with MS-DOS 5.0, copy it
from the Setup disks to the directory that contains your
CV.EXE file.
<P>
This problem has been fixed in CodeView version 3.14. Call
Microsoft C Support to get this version.

<OL><P><LI>Easel 6.0
</OL> 
Interactive Images Easel 6.0 is incompatible with the
DOS=HIGH and EMM386 commands. Contact your vendor for an
