<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
SMARTDrive 4.0, which is included with Windows 3.1, is able to report
information about the performance of SMARTDrive. Typing in the command
SMARTDRV /S reports cache hits, misses, element size, and disk caching
status. This information indicates the effectiveness of SMARTDrive.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Loading SMARTDrive (SMARTDRV.EXE) at the command line by typing
<P>
<PRE>   smartdrv.exe 2048 2048

</PRE>and then typing
<P>
<PRE>   smartdrv /s

</PRE>provides information similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Room for 256 elements of 8,192 bytes each
   There have been 8,980 cache hits
   and 1,966 cache misses

   Cache size: 2,097,152 bytes
   Cache size while running Windows: 2,097,152 bytes

               Disk Caching Status
   drive   read cache   write cache   buffering
   --------------------------------------------
   A:       yes          no            no
   B:       yes          no            no
   C:       yes          yes           no

</PRE><h2>DEFINITIONS</h2>
 
<P>
The following information defines the output of each line
in SMARTDRV /S.
<P>
Room for 256 Elements of 8,192 Bytes Each
 
<P>
The number of elements is modified depending upon the specified cache
size and the element size. In this case, 2,097,152 (the specified
cache size) divided by 8,192 (the element size) is 256 (the number of
elements). Therefore, there are 256 elements, each containing 8,192
bytes. Element size is the number of bytes that will be moved at one
time by SMARTDrive.
<P>
The number of elements reported can only be modified by changing the
element size or the cache size. The number of elements cannot be
modified directly. Information on how to change the cache size and
element size can be found on page 539 of the "Microsoft Windows User's
Guide" for version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>There Have Been 8,980 Cache Hits and 1,966 Cache Misses</h3>
 
<P>
The number of hits indicates how many times an element has been found
in the cache before going to the hard disk. The number of misses
indicates the element was not found in the read cache and a hard disk
access occurs.
<P>
Generally a larger specified cache size results in a higher
hit-to-miss ratio, although this depends on the type of usage. Because
the cache size is larger, more data will be found in the cache and
should result in a higher amount of hits. Note that allocating too
much memory to SMARTDrive can cause memory problems because there may
not be adequate memory for other programs.
<P>
Cache Size: 2,097,152 Bytes, Cache Size While Running
Windows: 2,097,152 Bytes
 
<P>
Cache size is determined by the number of elements multiplied by the
number of bytes in each element. In the above example, 256 (elements)
multiplied by 8,192 (number of bytes in each element) is 2,097,152.
<P>
<P><h3>Disk Caching Status</h3>
 
<P>
This reports the caching status of each drive (read cache, write
cache). It also reports buffering of each drive. For each drive
that is being cached, it can have one of three values in the
buffering column:
<P>
<PRE>   yes, no, or -

</PRE>"Yes" indicates that double buffering is needed. "No" indicates that
buffering is not needed. "-" indicates that SMARTDrive has not yet
determined the necessity of double buffering. If the buffering column
has all no's in it, the double-buffer driver is unneeded.
<P>
In most cases, double buffering is not needed. If it is determined that
double buffering is needed and Windows 3.1 Setup did not install it,
see page 541 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for information
about installing SMARTDrive in the CONFIG.SYS file with double
buffering.
<P>
For more information about SMARTDrive, see page 537 of the "Microsoft
Windows User's Guide" and page 252 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource
Kit" manual.
