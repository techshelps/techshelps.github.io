<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Many options exist to control access to resources in the NetWare
environment. The part of NetWare security used most often is trustee
rights. A trustee assignment is created by giving certain rights to a
user in a file server directory. It is through these trustee
assignments that users are granted access to programs and data on the
file server.
<P>
Trustee rights consist of both rights assigned to individuals at the
user level and rights assigned to groups as a whole. For instance,
Read, Open, and Search rights may be assigned at the group level for a
certain directory. However, it may be appropriate to grant only one
individual in the group Write privileges, which can be assigned at the
user level. The only rights that need to be assigned at the user level
are any that are in addition to those rights assigned at the group
level.
<P>
NOTE: Once a trustee assignment is granted, it includes all
subdirectories beneath the subject directory. For instance, if the
Read privilege is granted in the SYS:PUBLIC directory, that Read
privilege is automatically granted in the SYS:PUBLIC\UTILS directory.
<P>
Various combinations of the basic NetWare/286 (and earlier) rights --
Read, Write, Open, Create, Delete, Parental, Search, and Modify, which
are shown as [RWOCDPSM] -- provide a flexible means of defining the
security of a LAN.
<P>
Windows requires certain rights for setup to complete Setup /N.
<P>
For more information about these requirements and explanation of
symptoms, query on the following words:

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Assignment of rights can take two approaches, as follows:
<P>
<P><h3>The Trustee Approach</h3>
 
<P>
With the trustee approach, rights are granted to users at the
user or group level, using the SYSCON utility (or MAKEUSER).
<P>
<P><h3>The Directory Approach</h3>
 
<P>
With the directory approach, trustees are assigned on a
directory-by-directory basis, using the FILER utility.
<P>
The trustee privileges are stored in a hidden system file called
DIRSTAMP.SYS.
