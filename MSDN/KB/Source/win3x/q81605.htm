The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to install LANtastic versions 4.x network drivers
for use with Windows 3.0. According to Artisoft, the peer-to-peer network
LANtastic 4.x is fully compatible with Windows 3.0. In addition, according
to Artisoft, Windows 386 enhanced mode will now run on a LANtastic server
also being used as a workstation (nondedicated server).
<P>
The information that follows discusses both installation and upgrade of
LANtastic drivers for a local installation of Windows 3.0 on a workstation
and the setup of LANtastic drivers for a shared network installation of
Windows 3.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Setup for Local Installation of Windows</h3>
 
<P>
You must run the SETUP.EXE program from Windows to add the enhanced mode
LANtastic 4.x drivers for Windows.
<P>
NOTE: You must have the drivers copied to the appropriate directory on your
hard drive before you run the Windows Setup program (so that Windows can
find the drivers).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To install the LANtastic 4.x drivers for Windows 3.0:

<OL><P><LI>Change to your Windows directory (C:\WINDOWS by default).

<P><LI>Run Windows Setup without any parameters by typing the following
   at the MS-DOS command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      setup
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the System Information Screen, select Network.

<P><LI>Select Other (requires disk provided by manufacturer).

<P><LI>Replace the A:\ path with the path to the directory where you
   installed the LANtastic Network Operating System (NOS) files. For
   example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\lantasti
</PRE><P>
   Setup will find the file OEMSETUP.INF that contains the necessary
   settings for Windows to use when it executes. These settings will
   be copied into the Windows SYSTEM.INI file so that these parameters
   will be used each time you run Windows.

<P><LI>Select LANtastic Network Operating System 4.0.

<P><LI>Setup will return to the main menu with LANtastic NOS 4.0 as the
   network. Press ENTER to accept the new Windows configuration. Setup
   will make the changes and return to the MS-DOS command prompt.
<P>
</OL>Setup for a Shared Copy of Windows
 
<P>
To install a shared copy of Windows on a LANtastic network, follow the
instructions in the "Putting Windows on a Network" section on page 553 of
the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide." After expanding all the Windows disks
into the shared directory, change to the shared directory and make all the
files read-only by using the MS-DOS ATTRIB command, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   attrib +r *.*

</PRE></OL>Each network workstation can now log into the network and redirect a drive
designation to the shared Windows directory on the server. For example,
type the following:
<P>
<PRE>   net use w: \\server_name\c-drive
   cd\winshare
   setup /n

</PRE>Users can now set up to either their local hard drives or their directory
on the server drive. The network selected should be Microsoft Network or
100-percent compatible.
<P>
Once Windows is installed, exit to MS-DOS and run Windows Setup from the
WINDOWS directory using the SETUP /N command. Then do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Select Network.

<P><LI>Select Other (requires disk provided by manufacturer).

<P><LI>Backspace over the A:\ path and enter the path to the user's
   LANtastic Network Operating System (NOS) files. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\lantasti
</PRE>
<P><LI>Setup will use the OEMSETUP.INF from this directory. Select
   LANTASTIC NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEM 4.0.

<P><LI>Press ENTER to accept this configuration. Windows is now set up to
   run on the LANtastic network.
<P>
</OL><h3>Additional Notes for Both Configurations</h3>
 
<P>
The following line should have been added to the [boot] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   network.drv=LANTNET.DRV

</PRE></OL>The following lines should have been added in the [386Enh] section of
the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   network=*vnetbios,lantasti.386
   EMMExclude=D800-DFFF
   PerVMFiles=0
   NetHeapSize=64
   NetAsynchTimeout=5.0
   NetAsynchFallback=TRUE

</PRE>Note: If you are upgrading from earlier versions of LANtastic 2.x or
3.x, you need to remove the following lines from the [386Enh] section
of the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   InDOSPolling=TRUE
   ReflectDOSInt2a=TRUE
   UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
