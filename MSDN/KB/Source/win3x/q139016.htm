The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are using a program or tool that relies on the real-mode NetBIOS
interface provided by NetBEUI, your network session may be dropped in
Windows for Workgroups 3.11. This problem is most likely to occur with
programs or tools that load a real-mode TSR that interfaces with NetBIOS
and have Windows-based components that communicate with the TSR.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can be caused by a number of different timing and
optimization problems that can occur when a Windows-based component
uses the protected- mode NetBIOS interface to communicate with a real-
mode TSR running over real-mode NetBEUI.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Disabling the protected-mode NetBEUI component and optimizing the real-
mode NetBEUI protocol may increase the reliability of layered applications
based on a real-mode NetBIOS interface requiring real-mode NetBEUI.
<P>
The instructions in the following sections may help you to resolve the
problem described in this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Remove Protected-Mode NetBEUI/Use Real-Mode NetBEUI Only</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the Network group, double-click the Network Setup icon.

<P><LI>Click Drivers.

<P><LI>Click the network adapter driver, and then click Setup.

<P><LI>In the Driver Type box, click Real Mode NDIS Driver, and then click
   OK until you exit Network Setup.

<P><LI>When you are prompted to restart your computer, click Continue.

<P><LI>Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the System.ini file.
   Locate the line that reads
<P>
<P><PRE>      transport=netbeui.386
</PRE><P>
   and change it to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      transport=
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the following line to the [Network] section of the file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      AutoStart=NETBEUI
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save and then close the System.ini file.
<P>
</OL><h3>Optimize the Real-Mode NetBEUI Protocol</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the Network group, double-click the Network Setup icon.

<P><LI>Click Drivers.

<P><LI>Click the NetBEUI protocol, and then click Set As Default Protocol.

<P><LI>Click Setup, click Sessions, and increase the value to at least 16
   (depending on your results).

<P><LI>Click Set, click NCBS, and increase the value to at least 32
   (depending on your results).

<P><LI>Click Set, and then click OK until you exit Network Setup. When you
   are prompted to restart your computer, click Continue.
<P>
</OL><h3>Optimize the Virtualized Network Interface</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the System.ini file.

<P><LI>Locate the line that reads
<P>
<P><PRE>      NetHeapSize=20
</PRE><P>
   and change it to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NetHeapSize=32
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: You can use a value greater than 32, depending on your
   results.

<P><LI>Save and then close the System.ini file

<P><LI>Restart your computer.

</PRE></OL>The configuration described in this article was tested and is stable with
the original versions of the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 files. This
configuration was not found to be stable with the updated Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 files included on the Microsoft Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51
Server CD-ROMs or with the updated files included in Application Note
WG1129.
