The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Logitech has released an RF- (radio frequency) based serial, cordless
mouse called the Cordless Mouseman. Standard mouse troubleshooting
techniques generally apply with this mouse; however, some additional
considerations should be taken into account when troubleshooting this
mouse.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In addition to standard troubleshooting techniques, follow these steps
when troubleshooting the Logitech Cordless Mouseman:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the mouse and the receiver are on the same horizontal
   plane (that is, both are on the desktop). It is acceptable for the
   receiver to be out of the line-of-sight of the mouse (that is
   behind the CPU); however, both should be on the same horizontal
   plane for proper operation.

<P><LI>Verify that the mouse is no greater than 2 meters (about 5 feet)
   from the receiver because this is the maximum reception distance
   for the Cordless Mouseman.

<P><LI>Temporarily remove any possible source of RF interference, such as
   a cordless phone or other transmitting device, from the general
   area.

<P><LI>Check for the correct mouse driver. The latest version of the
   Cordless Mouseman is version 5.01, which is dated 3/19/91 and has a
   file size of 33,977 bytes.

<P><LI>Verify that the mouse (transmitter) and the receiver are operating
   at the same frequency by removing the battery from the mouse for a
   few seconds and then placing it back into the mouse. This will
   reset both the mouse and the receiver to frequency 4. Frequencies
   1-7 are available and can be selected manually so that the receiver
   and mouse match each other at another frequency if desired. To set
   the frequency manually, you must be at the MS-DOS command prompt.
<P>
   Do the following:
<P>
   a. Take the cover off of the mouse and note the number of flashes
<P><PRE>      per second that the green light indicates--this number is the
      current frequency.
</PRE><P>
   b. Use the left mouse button to set the frequency lower and use the
<P><PRE>      right mouse button to set the frequency higher.
</PRE><P>
   c. Turn the dial on the receiver to the same frequency number that
<P><PRE>      you set the mouse to.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Review the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to ensure that there is a MODE command
   to initialize the applicable COM port for 9600 bits per second (BPS)
   (that is, "mode com1:96,n,8,1,p" [without the quotation marks]).
<P>
   Also, from Windows, review the Settings option (accessed by
   choosing the Ports icon in Control Panel) to ensure that the port
   being used is set at 9600 BPS. This setting is required for the
   Cordless Mouseman to operate correctly.

<P><LI>Make sure the COM ports are correctly configured. The Logitech
   virtual mouse driver (LVMD.386) is hard coded for the standard base
   port addresses and interrupt requests (IRQs). The base addresses
   for COM1 and COM2 should be 3F8h and 2F8h, respectively. If the COM
   addresses are not configured correctly, or the IRQs are not
   standard, the Logitech series mouse fails to work in 386 enhanced
   mode.

<P><LI>If you are running Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode, you may
   encounter problems, such as an unresponsive pointer, when the
   MS-DOS Prompt or any MS-DOS-based application is run in a window.
   To correct this problem, do the following:
<P>
   a. Change the baud-rate setting for the mouse driver. To do this,
<P><PRE>      add the following line to the [LogiMouse] section of the
      SYSTEM.INI file:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         BaudRate=1200

   b. Include the 1200 option on the command line that loads the
      MS-DOS Logitech mouse driver (which is provided with Windows
      3.1) as follows:

         LMOUSE 1200

      Add the above line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to load the mouse
      driver each time you start your system. The next time you start
      Windows, your mouse should work correctly.

</PRE></OL>NOTE: The command lines "logimenu" and "click" (without the quotation
marks), which are usually loaded from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, are
included with this mouse as well as other Logitech mice. They are
terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs), and as such, may cause
problems with Windows installation and/or operation.
