The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following Novell NetWare 286 rights are required to run the
Microsoft Windows SETUP /N command from a shared server directory to a
network user directory:
<P>
<PRE>   In the shared directory, the user running SETUP /N must have Search
   (S), Open (O), and Read (R) rights.

   In the user directory, the user running SETUP /N must have Create
   (C), Delete (D), Read (R), Write (W), Open (O), Modify (M), and
   Search (S) rights. (That is, the user must have all rights except
   Parental [P].) NetWare 386 uses slightly different privilege
   naming, but this can be used as a guideline.

</PRE>This information applies to Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a discussion of the symptoms of not having the
various rights (privileges) to the directories when running SETUP /N.
<P>
<PRE>Shared Directory        SETUP /N Returns
----------------        ----------------

No Search right (S)     Bad command or filename
No Open right   (O)     Bad command or filename
No Read right   (R)     Access denied

User Directory          SETUP /N Returns
--------------          ----------------

No Create right (C)     *
No Delete right (D)     *
No Read right   (R)     **
No Write right  (W)     **
No Open right   (O)     **
No Modify right (M)     **
No Search right (S)     Returns to MS-DOS command prompt with no
                        message

</PRE>* File Copy Error. Unknown File Copy Failure: X:win.src
<P>
** Setup is having trouble making changes to
<PRE>    your SYSTEM.INI file.

</PRE>In order to make changes to your Windows configuration, you must
delete WINVER.EXE from your Windows directory and then run Setup again
to reinstall Windows.
<P>
Using the SETUP /N or SETUP command on a local hard drive has been
reported to also fail in systems with some ARCNET boards configured
for IRQ2. In test configurations, changing the interrupt from IRQ2 to
IRQ3 corrected the problems. Novell also confirmed that changing the
interrupt on certain cards corrects several problems with different
(usually older) ARCNET boards. In the test, there was nothing to
indicate that there should have been any sort of interrupt conflict.
<P>
The following error message may occur when running SETUP /N
on systems with some ARCNET cards:
<P>
<PRE>   File copy error:  Unknown File Copy Failure

</PRE>To correct this, use SETUP /I /N. Be sure to use the switches in this
order, otherwise the /I switch will be ignored. Also confirm the
following are true:

<OL><P><LI>The Novell Shell version 3.01 is being used.

<P><LI>All the Windows 3.0 or 3.0a files have been expanded to the
   network.

<P><LI>All rights for the target directory (except for Parental) are
   present.

<P><LI>All expanded .SY$ files have been renamed.
<P>
</OL>Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here as it becomes available.
