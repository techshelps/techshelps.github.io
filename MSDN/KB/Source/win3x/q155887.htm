<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Since the release of the Windows Telephony (TAPI) SDK for Windows 3.1 in
November, 1993, there have been changes in the telephone dialing procedures
used in several countries/regions. In addition, some countries/regions have
changed country/region codes, new countries/regions have come into
existence, and other changes have occurred. TAPI obtains information
related to countries/regions and dialing rules from the [Countries] section
of the Telephon.ini file in the Windows folder. You must update the
Telephon.ini file in the Windows folder in order to use the most recent
information available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There is an entry in the [Countries] section of the Telephon.ini file for
each country/region. For example, Singapore has the following entry:
<P>
<PRE>   Country65=65,66,"Singapore","G","","001EFG"

</PRE>The sections in this entry are described below:

<UL><LI>"Country65" identifies the entry in the country/region list. The "65"
   after the word "Country" is the country/region code ID (identifier),
   which must be unique in the list (and, for most countries/regions, is usually
   the same as the country/region code). For example, the "65" here is for
   Singapore. If you needed to change the access code for the United
   states, you would use "Country1."

<LI>The "65" to the right of the equal sign is the country/region code for
   Singapore. "66" is the next number in the sequence of country/region
   codes. This second number may or may not be contiguous, but it must be
   correct.

<LI>"Singapore" is the country/region name in this example.

<LI>"G" is the local dialing rules. This indicates that local dialing
   requires only the local number.

<LI>"" represents the long distance dialing rules. In Singapore, there are
   no long distance calls; therefore, there are no dialing rules for long
   distance. In the United States, this would be "1FG" indicating a 1,
   the area code, and a local number.

<LI>"001EFG" represents the dialing rules for international dialing. 001
   is the international dialing access number for the country/region. "EFG"
   represents the country/region code, area code, and local number for the
   number being dialed.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Localized versions of Windows (for languages other than English) need
the same entries in the Telephon.ini file. The only part of the entry that
is localized is the name of the country/region.
<P>
To update your Telephon.ini file to contain the latest country/region
information and dialing rules, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a backup copy of the Telephon.ini file by copying it to another
   name (such as Telephon.sav).

<P><LI>Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the Telephon.ini file
   in the Windows folder.

<P><LI>Delete the [Countries] section of the file, including the [Countries]
   header and all the "Country" lines below it.

<P><LI>Insert the following [Countries] section into the Telephon.ini file and
   then save and close the file:
