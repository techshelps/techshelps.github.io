The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When Media Player does not play MIDI files, one or more of the following
conditions may be causing the problem:

<UL><LI>The sound card is not installed properly.

<LI>A MIDI driver is not installed.

<LI>The MIDI Mapper is set incorrectly.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Before attempting complicated troubleshooting, restart Windows and
see whether your system functions correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Making Sure the Sound Card Is Properly Installed</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Determine whether the sound card can generate sounds from MS-DOS. Most
   sound cards come with MS-DOS programs for playing sounds and testing
   card configurations. If these do not work, the Windows sound support
   cannot work either.

<P><LI>Make sure the sound card does not conflict with other hardware.

<P><LI>Verify Port and IRQ settings.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If the sound card also supports digitized sound and wave (.WAV) files
and .WAV files can be played, the card is properly installed.
<P>
<P><h3>Making Sure the MIDI Driver Is Installed</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>The Device.Midi Sequencer command should be available in Media Player.
   If not, the MIDI driver should be reinstalled. It may be necessary to
   remove the current installed MIDI driver and then reinstall it. To do
   this:
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, choose the Drivers icon.
<P>
   b. Select the current installed [MCI] Midi Sequencer driver, choose
<P><PRE>      Remove, and then restart Windows.
</PRE><P>
   c. In Control Panel, choose the Drivers icon.
<P>
   d. Choose Add, then choose the Midi Sequencer. If you have the Windows
<P><PRE>      disks, choose New; otherwise, choose Current.
</PRE><P>
   e. Restart Windows before you use Media Player.

<P><LI>Check to see whether the MIDI driver is installed under Drivers in
   Control Panel. If the sound card is Ad Lib compatible, try using the
   Ad Lib driver that ships with Windows 3.1. To install the Ad Lib driver:
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, choose the Drivers icon.
<P>
   b. Choose the Add button.
<P>
   c. Select the Ad Lib driver from the list, or select the Unlisted
<P><PRE>      or Updated driver if the driver is on an OEM disk.
</PRE><P>
   d. Choose Restart Windows to activate the driver.
<P>
</OL>Note that the PC Speaker driver does not support playing MIDI files.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting MIDI Mapper Correctly</h3>
 
<P>
After loading CANYON.MID with Media Player and pressing the Play button,
the following message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   The current MIDI Mapper setup refers to a MIDI device that is not
   installed on the system. Use MIDI Mapper to edit the setup.

</PRE></OL>If this message appears, run Control Panel and check the default setup
in the MIDI Mapper. It should be set to the correct device that is
installed.
<P>
If the Ad Lib driver is installed, the MIDI Mapper should be set to
the Ad Lib setup. If a different MIDI device is installed, choose an
appropriate setup for the device.
<P>
To set the MIDI Mapper to use the Ad Lib setup:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, choose the MIDI Mapper icon.

<P><LI>Press ALT+S to show setups.

<P><LI>Press ALT+A to move to the name field for setups.

<P><LI>Use the UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys to set the name field to Ad Lib,
   and the description below the name field to "Base-level setup."

<P><LI>Close the MIDI Mapper to accept this setup.
<P>
</OL><h3>SYSTEM.INI Settings for Systems Using the Sound Blaster 1.5 Driver</h3>

<P><h3>Other Problems Preventing MIDI Playing</h3>
 
<P>
The following are other situations that prevent MIDI playing:

<UL><LI>Norton Desktop for Windows 1.0 is installed.

<LI>You have upgraded from Multimedia Extensions version 1.0 (see
   README.WRI section 7.0). Windows 3.1 SETUP.EXE renames existing
   MIDI Mapper configuration files to MIDIMAP.OLD in the SYSTEM
   directory.
