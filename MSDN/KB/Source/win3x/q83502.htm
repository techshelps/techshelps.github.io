The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows operating
system version 3.1 SETUP.TXT file. This article contains Setup notes and
machine and video notes.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This file contains information about problems that may occur while
running Windows Setup and describes problems that can occur when using
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs or drivers with Windows or
Windows Setup. If you are using a TSR or if you encounter problems
setting up Windows version 3.1, read this document BEFORE running
Setup again.
<P>
General Setup Notes
 
This section includes notes on specific system configurations that may
prevent Setup from installing Windows successfully. A solution to each
problem is provided.
<P>
If you are using a hardware or software product listed here, follow
the proposed recommendations before running Setup.
<P>
MS-DOS Screen Savers
 
If you are using an MS-DOS screen saver, you should disable it before
running Setup. These screen savers can cause problems when running
Setup.
<P>
COMPAQ Computer with MS-DOS Version 5.0 and EGA or VGA
 
If you are using the upgrade version of Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0, check
your CONFIG.SYS file to make sure the following drivers appear in this
order:
<P>
<PRE>    HIMEM.SYS
    EMM386.EXE
    ANSI.SYS

</PRE>Note: If you are using the COMPAQ version of MS-DOS 5.0,
<PRE>      HIMEM.EXE is used in place of HIMEM.SYS and CEMM.EXE
      is used in place of EMM386.EXE.

</PRE>If ANSI.SYS is loaded before HIMEM.SYS or EMM386.EXE (or if you are
using COMPAQ MS-DOS 5.0 before HIMEM.EXE or CEMM.EXE), Setup may
restart your system before Windows is installed. Also, if you are
using the DOS=HIGH,UMB command line to load MS-DOS into upper memory,
loading EMM386.EXE (or CEMM.EXE) before loading ANSI.SYS will create
the maximum amount of upper memory space on a COMPAQ computer.
<P>
<P><h3>AT&amp;T Safari Computer</h3>
 
If you have an AT&amp;T Safari computer, you cannot maintain two versions
of Windows (version 3.0 and version 3.1) on your system. You must
upgrade over version 3.0. If you set up Windows 3.1 in its own
directory, Windows will not use the special drivers required for it to
run on the Safari computer.
<P>
Using the TIGA Display Driver
 
If you are using the TIGA display driver, you must load the TIGACD.EXE
MS-DOS driver manually before running Setup to upgrade Windows.
Otherwise, Windows will not upgrade your system properly.
<P>
After successfully setting up Windows, you can increase the amount of
conventional memory available to non-Windows applications when Windows
is running in 386 enhanced mode by loading TIGACD.EXE from the
WINSTART.BAT file. The WINSTART.BAT file runs only in 386 enhanced
mode. If you want to run Windows in standard mode, you must load
TIGACD.EXE manually. For more information, see the README.WRI online
document.
<P>
<P><h3>Displays That Are Incompatible with Windows Version 3.1</h3>
 
Certain display adapters can cause problems with Windows version 3.1.
The most serious problem is a system failure while running Windows
Setup. If you encounter this problem, run Custom Setup, and then
select one of the standard display types, such as VGA, provided with
Windows version 3.1.
<P>
With other display drivers, Windows may be set up successfully but
TrueType fonts may not appear correctly on your screen. An updated
driver may be available in the Windows Driver Library or from your
display vendor or manufacturer. For information about obtaining the
Windows Driver Library, see "Getting Started with Microsoft Windows."
<P>
The following display adapters may cause problems:
<P>
-  ATI Graphics Ultra and Vantage
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: These adapters are 8514/a-compatible and run well
         with the 8514/a driver provided with Windows 3.1.

</PRE>- All DGIS display adapters (Direct Graphics Interface Standard)
<PRE>  from Graphic Software Systems, including the following:
        NEC MultiSynch Graphics Engine (MGE)
        Zenith Z-649
        HP IGC-10, IGC-20
        GSS 1000 Series

   NOTE: Some DGIS-based adapters are TIGA-compatible and
         run well when used with the appropriate TIGACD.EXE
         MS-DOS driver and with the TIGA driver provided with
         Windows 3.1.

</PRE>- HP Ultra VGA
- IBM Image Adapter/A
- Matrox MG Series/M-WIN Series
- Palettized VGA 640x480, 16-color (provided with Windows
<PRE>  Multimedia Extensions version 1.0)
</PRE>- Radius SVGA MultiView
<P>
- All RGDI (Renaissance Graphics Device Interface) display
<PRE>  adapters from Appian, Inc., including the following:
       Appian Rendition II, IIe, II/XE, and III
       Appian GV1024
       Decpc 433

</PRE>- All S3 adapters, including the following:
<PRE>      Orchid Fahrenheit 1280
      STB WIND/X
      Diamond Stealth VRAM

</PRE><h3>Using Stacker</h3>
 
If you are using Stacker to compress your hard disk, there are certain
steps you need to take before setting up Windows.
<P>
*  If you want to use a swap file with Windows, you must
<PRE>   set up the swap file on the uncompressed drive. When
   setting up Stacker, you can leave at least 1 megabyte (MB)
   of disk space uncompressed for storing system files. To
   leave enough space for the swap file, it is recommended
   that the amount of uncompressed disk space equal at least
   twice the amount of system memory. For example, if your
   system has 4 MB of memory, you should leave at least 8 MB
   of disk space uncompressed.

   If Stacker is already set up on your system and there is not
   enough uncompressed disk space for a swap file, you can run
   the STAC utility provided with Stacker to increase the amount
   of uncompressed disk space. For more information, see your
   Stacker documentation.

</PRE>*  If you are using Stacker version 2.0 or later, Windows Setup
<PRE>   modifies your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. When Setup
   is finished making the modifications, it displays a message
   at the end of the Windows portion of Setup notifying you of
   the modifications. If you have used Stacker to swap your
   startup drive, when you restart your system Stacker will
   ask whether you want to update to the new version of the
   CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. It is recommended that you
   update.

   If you are using a version of Stacker earlier than 2.0, you
   may need to modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
   yourself. For more information, see "Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS
   and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself," following this topic.

</PRE>*  For best performance, do not use SMARTDrive to cache the
<PRE>   compressed drive. You only need to cache the uncompressed
   drive. You can include options on the SMARTDRV.EXE line of
   the CONFIG.SYS file to specify which drives to cache.

   For example, if the Stacker swap utility swaps drives C and
   D so that C is compressed and D is uncompressed, you would
   include the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

        device=\windows\smartdrv.exe C- D+

</PRE>For more information about swap files and using SMARTDrive, see
Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows," in the "Microsoft Windows User's
Guide."
<P>
<P><h3>Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself</h3>
 
When you set up Windows, Setup usually places the HIMEM.SYS,
SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE files in the Windows directory. If the
Windows directory is on a disk that is not available when you start
your computer, such as a removable or nonlocal disk, or if Setup
detects one of the following conditions, Setup does not modify the
CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
- Your boot drive has been modified by a disk-compression
<PRE>  utility.

</PRE>- Your CONFIG.SYS file contains references to block device
<PRE>  drivers.

</PRE>- There is not enough available space on your hard disk to
<PRE>  copy the files.

</PRE>- The files are already installed on your system and Setup
<PRE>  cannot overwrite them (they are read-only).

</PRE>Instead, Setup writes proposed changes to the CONFIG.WIN and
AUTOEXEC.WIN or the CONFIG.00x and AUTOEXEC.00x files. In this case,
you must either move the HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE files
to a drive that is available when you start your computer, or use a
text editor to modify your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that any
references to HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE appear after the
device= command line used to load the drivers for your disk drives.
Refer to the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN or the CONFIG.00x and
AUTOEXEC.00x files for the proposed changes.
<P>
Setting Up XGA on a PS/2 Model 75 or 90
 
If you have a PS/2 model 75 or 90 with an XGA, Windows Setup will
configure the display adapter for 16-color, 640x480 resolution. Do not
change this configuration during Setup. Specifying a different XGA
configuration while setting up Windows may cause Setup to fail.
<P>
After you have successfully installed Windows, you can configure your
XGA to use a different resolution or 256 colors, if your monitor
supports it. For more information on how to do this, see the topic
"IBM XGA" in the README.WRI online document.
<P>
If you are using the plasma screen on the PS/2 model 75, use ONLY the
640x480, 16-color configuration. If you change this configuration, you
will be returned to the MS-DOS prompt when you try to start Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Correcting the "Out of Environment Space" Error Message</h3>
 
If you receive an "out of environment space" message when starting
Windows, you can either:
<P>
*  Increase the size of your environment by adding the SHELL=
<PRE>   command line to your CONFIG.SYS file. See your MS-DOS
   documentation for more information about the SHELL command
   and modifying your CONFIG.SYS file.

</PRE>*  Move the SET commands in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
<PRE>   to the beginning of the file so that they run before the
   commands that load terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
   programs or drivers, such as SMARTDrive.

</PRE><h3>If Windows Setup Does Not Detect Your Network</h3>
 
If you have a network installed and Setup specifies "No Network" in
the System-Information screen, Setup is not able to detect your
network. For Setup to detect certain networks, the directory that
contains the network program files must be included in your path.
<P>
This is a known problem with these networks: 3Share, 3Open, LAN
Manager, and MSNet. If your path does not include the directory where
the network files are located, you can either:
<P>
*  Add the directory to the PATH line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
<PRE>   file.

</PRE>*  Run Custom Setup and specify the full path for your
<PRE>   network in the System-Information screen.
