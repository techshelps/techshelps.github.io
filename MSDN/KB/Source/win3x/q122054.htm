<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a list of PCMCIA card sizes and types.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Physical Specifications</h3>
 
<P>
PCMCIA cards have one of the following standard physical dimensions:
<P>
<PRE>Type I Card         54 mm by 85.6 mm by 3.3 mm
Type II Card        54 mm by 85.6 mm by 5 mm
Type III Card       54 mm by 85.6 mm by 10.5 mm

</PRE>The PCMCIA card size is the same as a standard credit card except for
thickness and corner rounding. Sometimes PCMCIA cards are referred to as
credit-card memory or adapters.
<P>
Certain Toshiba notebook computers and other machines have a non-standard,
oversized slot for which there are non-standard, oversized cards ranging
from 14.5 millimeter (mm) to 16 mm (or more) thick. These cards and slots
are sometimes incorrectly referred to as "Type IV." This size card will
probably not become part of the PCMCIA standard.
<P>
A Type II card has the same thickness as a Type I card along the long sides
and connector end; this provides mechanical compatibility. A bubble 0.85 mm
thick on the top and bottom surfaces increases the card's total thickness
to 5 mm. A Type III card has a additional 5.5 mm on the top surface bubble
for a total thickness of 10.5 mm.
<P>
The standard allows a maximum card length of 135.6 mm, which means the card
can extend outside the host. This accommodates bulky devices such as
batteries, oversized connectors, removable media, transceivers, and the
antenna required by some devices.
