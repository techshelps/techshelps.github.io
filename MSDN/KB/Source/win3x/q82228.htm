The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, the TimerCriticalSection=
setting can be used in Microsoft Windows running in 386 enhanced mode to
prevent system corruption for some networks and terminate-and-stay-resident
(TSR) programs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The TimerCriticalSection= setting must be entered as follows
<P>
<PRE>   [386Enh]
   TimerCriticalSection=nnnn

</PRE>where "nnnn" is the amount of time in milliseconds before the critical
section is timed out. For example, a value of 1000 would indicate a 1
second time-out for the timer critical section.
<P>
When this feature is enabled, the virtual machine (VM) assumes ownership of
the critical section before sending a timer interrupt. This prevents timer
interrupts from being serviced in one virtual machine while another virtual
machine is in the critical section (for example, making an MS-DOS call).
<P>
The time-out feature allows you to fine-tune the amount of time Windows
blocks a timer interrupt from being serviced in a virtual machine. When a
virtual machine returns from servicing a timer interrupt, the critical
section is released and the time-out is canceled to allow other virtual
machines to service timer interrupts. Typically the time-out will never
occur, so it is best to set the TimerCriticalSection= value to a large
value such as 5000. A virtual machine would then be allowed to "own" all
timer interrupts for up to 5 seconds before other virtual machines would be
allowed to run. Because timer interrupt service routines return very
quickly in almost all situations, this will not present a problem. However,
a pop-up program such as Borland's SideKick pops-up on a timer interrupt
and does not return until you pop it down. The time-out is provided to
handle this situation.
<P>
TimerCriticalSection=2000 has prevented system corruption on both Banyan
and Novell networks.
