The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information on potential causes of the Microsoft
Windows version 3.0 error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unrecoverable Application Error
   Terminating current application

</PRE>This error occurs only in standard- and enhanced-mode Windows 3.0. It
indicates that a Windows application has caused a protection violation
(that is, an application has written to a memory space to which it
does not have access, potentially corrupting other code in that area
of memory).
<P>
If you receive this error, the Windows 3.0 system will be unstable
until you exit Windows, reboot the system, and restart Windows. After
one application causes such an error, memory will be corrupted. This
could cause other applications to subsequently receive the same error,
even though they are not actually the cause of the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are possible causes for an unrecoverable application
error.
<P>
<P><h3>Application Designed for Previous Windows Version</h3>
 
<P>
You are running an application that was designed for Windows versions 2.x
under Windows 3.0 in standard or enhanced mode.
<P>
If an application has not been properly designed to function correctly
under Windows 3.0 protected modes, it causes an  error. If an application
is designed for Windows versions 2.x, it generates a dialog box when
executed that advises you of this error. Such applications should be run
only under Windows 3.0 real mode as the dialog box suggests.
<P>
<P><h3>Incorrect Setup</h3>
 
<P>
You have selected an incorrect machine and/or network while using the Setup
program.
<P>
Some machines and networks require you to override the default detection
made by Windows 3.0 Setup and make a specific selection. If the correct
selection is not made, Windows cannot operate correctly.
<P>
Machines that must be specifically selected in Windows Setup include the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   All 80386- and 80486-based AST machines
   All 80386-based Zenith machines
   All Hewlett-Packard machines
   Everex Step 386/25
   NCR PC 386SX
   NCR PC 925
   NEC PowerMate SX Plus
   NEC ProSpeed 386
   Toshiba 1600
   Toshiba 5200

</PRE>Networks that must be specifically selected in Windows Setup include the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   3Com 3+Open LAN Manager (XNS only)
   3Com 3+Share
   Banyan VINES version 4.0
   LAN Manager versions 1.x (or 100-percent compatible)
   IBM PC LAN program

</PRE>If you did not choose your machine or network specifically during Setup,
you should exit Windows and run the MS-DOS version of Setup from the
WINDOWS directory. This allows you to make the proper selection without
having to completely reinstall Windows 3.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Incompatible TSRs</h3>
 
<P>
You have incompatible TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) programs or
unsupported network drivers in the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
<P>
Temporarily remove all suspect drivers and TSR programs to bring the system
to a minimum configuration for testing purposes. If this eliminates the
problem, then the problem was caused by one of the drivers or TSRs that was
removed. Replace the removed lines one by one until the problem reappears,
thus showing which line was causing the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Page-Mapping Conflict</h3>
 
<P>
You have a page-mapping conflict in enhanced mode.
<P>
This cause applies only to enhanced-mode Windows. Test the problem under
standard mode by running Windows with the WIN /S parameter. If the problem
does not occur in standard mode, it may be a page-mapping conflict in the
adapter segment area of memory (between A000 and EFFF hexadecimal). Use an
ASCII text editor, such as Notepad or SysEdit, to edit the SYSTEM.INI file
and insert the following line in the [386Enh] section:
<P>
<PRE>      EMMExclude=A000-EFFF

</PRE>This excludes the entire adapter segment from mapping. This line is not
case sensitive. If inserting this line solves the problem, you may want to
determine the position of all hardware adapters in the adapter segment and
exclude them specifically rather than excluding the entire region. Multiple
EMMExclude lines may be used if necessary. If you are using a Micro Channel
Architecture (MCA) bus machine such as an IBM PS/2, you may determine the
adapter location by booting with the machine's Reference Disk. If you are
using a Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus machine, consult your
adapter documentation and/or manufacturer's technical support service for
information on memory locations used, if any.
<P>
NOTE: You shouldn't leave the entire range excluded because Windows will
not be able to use any of the memory there to set up such things as
expanded memory for MS-DOS applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Incorrect DOS Version</h3>
 
<P>
Machines should have the proper DOS version for their hardware type. OEM
(Original Equipment Manufacturer) versions of MS-DOS such as COMPAQ DOS or
IBM PC-DOS should not be used except on their respective OEM hardware
platforms (that is, COMPAQ DOS only on COMPAQ machines, IBM PC-DOS only on
IBM machines).
<P>
On other machines, the proper DOS should be determined by the following
rule: If the manufacturer has an OEM version of DOS, it should be used. If
the manufacturer does not have an OEM version of DOS, generic Microsoft
MS-DOS should be used.
