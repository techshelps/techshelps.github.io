<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are a number of Windows independent software vendor (ISV)
applications and some hardware installation programs that install their own
Windows communications drivers to replace the Windows-provided drivers.
Most of these replacement drivers are Windows 3.0 compatible. To use them
in Windows 3.1 386 enhanced mode, the following switch is required in the
[386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI: "commdrv30=true". These drivers should
work in standard mode without any modifications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If a Windows 3.0 communications driver has been installed and you try to
access a communications port, Windows 3.1 displays a full-screen MS-DOS box
warning you that a Windows 3.0 compatible communications driver is
installed and to use the aforementioned switch. It is recommended that you
use this switch and the Windows 3.0 compatible drivers only if the Windows
3.1 communications drivers fail to work.
<P>
Most replacement drivers typically replace three key device lines in the
SYSTEM.INI file. Below is a sample listing of the relevant portions of
SYSTEM.INI. If any of these device lines look different from what is listed
below, it is a good indication that a replacement communication driver has
been installed.
