</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
This application note contains an updated sound driver for use with
Microsoft Windows Sound System version 1.0. This driver was created
for use on computers with 386 or higher processors that exhibit
problems with demand-mode direct memory access (DMA) transfers.
<P>
Symptoms of demand-mode DMA transfer problems may include:
<P>
<PRE>   - Compressed wave (.WAV) files produce only static when played.

   - Uncompressed wave (.WAV) files produce some static when played.

   - Wave (.WAV) files play at a rate of speed that is approximately
     twice the normal speed.

</PRE>33 and 50 megahertz (MHz) machines using the Symphony chip set are
known to exhibit all or some of the above symptoms.
<P>
The updated driver included with this application note changes the DMA
mode used during data transfers to the Windows Sound System hardware.
It allows the Windows Sound System software to perform single-mode DMA
transfers.
<P>
By default, the Windows Sound System uses demand-mode DMA. This means
that multibyte transfers can occur during a single data request cycle.
Certain chip sets may have difficulty handling the timing of this
cycle, sometimes causing multibyte transfers to work incorrectly. By
using single-mode DMA, a single byte is transferred per data request
cycle. This allows certain chip sets to function with the Windows
Sound System hardware; however, it does reduce the bus bandwidth.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: If your chip set can only operate with single-mode DMA
   transfers, high bandwidth data formats (such as stereo, 16-bit 22
   kilohertz [kHz], and 16-bit 44kHz) may cause pops and clicks when
   the bus is busy due to high network or disk activity. At this time,
   there is no software workaround for this problem. If you encounter
   this problem, contact your chip set manufacturer for a workaround
   and/or upgrade.

</PRE>The WW0764 disk included with this application note contains one file:
SNDSYS.DRV. This file replaces the file of the same name located in
your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>To install the updated driver:</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following, and then
   press enter
<P>
<P><PRE>    cd \&lt;windir&gt;\system
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;windir&gt; is the name of your Windows directory. If your
   Windows directory is called WINDOWS, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>    cd \windows\system
</PRE>
<P><LI>Rename the existing file by typing:
<P>
<P><PRE>    ren sndsys.drv sndsys.old
</PRE>
<P><LI>Insert the enclosed WW0764 disk in your floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following, and then
   press enter
<P>
<P><PRE>    copy &lt;drive:&gt;\sndsys.drv &lt;destination:&gt;\windows\system
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive:&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the WW0764 disk
   and &lt;destination:&gt; is the drive where your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory resides. For example, if the WW0764 disk is in drive A
   and your Windows directory is called WINDOWS and is on drive C,
</OL>type
<PRE>   the following command:

    copy a:\sndsys.drv c:\windows\system

</PRE><P><LI>Using a text editor, such as Microsoft Windows Notepad, add the
   following line to the [SNDSYS.DRV] section of your SYSTEM.INI file
   (usually located in the Windows directory):
<P>
<P><PRE>    SingleModeDMA=TRUE
</PRE><P>
</OL>NOTE: This line must be present in order for the updated driver to
perform single-mode DMA transfers.
