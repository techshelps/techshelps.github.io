The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you try to install updated sound card drivers in Windows, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   These drivers require a newer version of Windows 3.1

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message occurs under the following circumstances:

<UL><LI>You attempt to add updated sound card drivers designed for Windows
   3.1 to Windows 3.0 with multimedia extensions.

<LI>You have installed both Norton Desktop for Windows and Berkeley
   System's After Dark screen saver on Windows 3.1. Norton Desktop and
   After Dark add virtual device drivers (VxDs) in the [386ENH]
   section of the SYSTEM.INI file. These drivers can cause the error
   message to occur.

<LI>You have a tape drive, SCSI drive, or other hardware device installed
   on the system, and that device is using the same DMA channel as the
   sound card.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting Steps</h3>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, follow these troubleshooting steps:

<OL><P><LI>If this error message occurs under Windows 3.0, install the drivers
   that were provided by the manufacturer for use with the Windows 3.0
   multimedia extensions, or check with the manufacturer to make sure
   that the drivers were intended to be used with Windows 3.0.

<P><LI>Make sure that no terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs or
   device drivers are loading in the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
   that may be conflicting with Windows. For more information, query
   on "clean boot" in the Knowledge Base.

<P><LI>Run Windows in standard mode (use the WIN /S command), then try
   installing the drivers for the sound card.

<P><LI>If the problem still occurs in standard mode, make sure there is no
   conflict between the sound card and another hardware device. For
   more information on configuring the sound card, consult the
   manufacturer.

<P><LI>If there is no hardware conflict, try reinstalling Windows 3.1 into
   a new directory. Make sure that no third-party applications (for
   example, Norton Desktop or After Dark) are installed on top of
   Windows. Then try adding the drivers for the sound card.
<P>
</OL>Norton Desktop for Windows and Berkeley Systems' After Dark are
manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or
reliability.
