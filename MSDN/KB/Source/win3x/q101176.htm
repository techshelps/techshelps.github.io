The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0 and 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information on the documentation errors in the
"Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0. The following topics
are covered:

<UL><LI>Printing a File from the Search Results Window
<LI>EMM386.SYS Page Frame Uses "p3" Parameter, Not "p4"
<LI>Setup Does Not Detect That Windows 3.0 Is Already Installed
<LI>Configuring an 8086 or 8088 System
<LI>Null Modem Connector Settings in Terminal
<LI>Invalid Set Temp Directory Name
<LI>Windows 3.0 File Manager Will Not Search Entire Hard Disk Drive
<LI>How Paintbrush Uses Fonts
<LI>SPART.PAR and 386SPART.PAR Incorrectly Described
<LI>Clicking Outside a Copied Cutout in Paintbrush
<LI>Dithered Colored Text Can be Drawn in Paintbrush
<LI>Blank Window Title in PIF Editor Defaults to PIF Name
<LI>Terminal Will Not Accept Eight Data Bits and Odd Parity
<LI>Location of Terminal Function Keys Incorrect in "User's Guide"
<P>
</UL><h3>Printing a File from the Search Results Window</h3>
 
<P>
Pages 124-125 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0,
incorrectly states you can select files and directories in the Search
Results window and use File menu commands to print, copy, and move
window contents. You can copy and move Search Results window contents,
but you cannot print them.
<P>
Under Windows version 3.0 you cannot print a file from the Search
Results window. The Print option is unavailable (dimmed) and cannot be
chosen.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.0.
This problem was corrected in Windows version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>EMM386.SYS Page Frame Uses "p3" Parameter, Not "p4"</h3>
 
<P>
Page 598 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0
discusses two methods for indicating the beginning address of the
expanded-memory page frame created by EMM386.SYS. The second method is
incorrect.
<P>
The first method uses the frame= parameter and creates a LIM
3.2-compatible page frame beginning at D000:0000. The second method is
incorrect and is shown as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   device=emm386.sys 512 p0=D000 p1=D400 p2=D800 p4=DC00

</PRE>This command line in CONFIG.SYS will generate the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   WARNING - EMM386 installed without a LIM 3.2 compatible Page Frame

</PRE>The "p4" parameter on the command line is the source of the error. The
fourth page of the page frame is specified with the parameter "p3,"
not "p4." Hence, to generate a LIM 3.2 compatible page frame, the
command line should read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   device=emm386.sys 512 p0=D000 p1=D400 p2=D800 p3=DC00

</PRE><h3>Setup Does Not Detect That Windows 3.0 Is Already Installed</h3>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0 provides
instructions on how to install new Windows device drivers on page 564
under "To install a device driver not supplied with Windows." Step 1
is correct but does not specify that you must be in the Windows
directory after exiting Windows in order for Setup to display the list
of the current Windows configuration as expected in step 2.
<P>
If you attempt to change the Windows configuration and you are NOT
logged into the Windows directory (where the SETUP.EXE resides) before
you start Windows 3.0 SETUP.EXE, the Setup program will not detect
that Windows 3.0 is already installed and will not display the current
Windows configuration as you would expect. Setup will begin installing
a new copy of Windows 3.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Program Manager Doesn't Shrink Group to Program Item Icon</h3>
 
<P>
There is a documentation error on page 82 of the "Microsoft Windows
User's Guide." The statement reads as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Group Windows do not close like other Windows. If you double-click
   the group's Control-menu box or choose Close from the Control
   menu, Program Manager shrinks the group to a program item icon.

</PRE>Program Manager group windows shrink to group icons, not program item
icons.
<P>
<P><h3>Configuring an 8086 or 8088 System</h3>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0 contains
incorrect information in the "Configuring an 8086 or 8088 Computer"
on page 502. The statement reads:
<P>
<PRE>   If your system has an EGA monitor and you run non-Windows
   applications with Windows in real mode or standard mode,
   your CONFIG.SYS file should contain a command line like the
   following:

      device=c:\windows\ega.sys

</PRE>An 8086 or 8088 computer cannot run Windows in standard mode. Standard
mode requires a 80286, 80386, or 80486 microprocessor and extended
memory.
<P>
<P><h3>Null Modem Connector Settings in Terminal</h3>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" incorrectly states on page 328
that "If you are using a null modem, select None" for the Connector
field of the Communications dialog box under the Settings menu of
Terminal. If the Connector is set to None, Terminal cannot send or
receive data.
<P>
When using Terminal for null modem communications, you must set the
Connector field to match the communications port to which the null
modem cable is connected.
<P>
<P><h3>Invalid Set Temp Directory Name</h3>
 
<P>
On page 538 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide," the example of
the set temp directory variable is incorrect:
<P>
<PRE>   set temp=c:\tempfiles


</PRE>This is a nine character directory name; MS-DOS has a limit of eight
characters.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 3.0 File Manager Will Not Search Entire Hard Disk Drive</h3>
 
<P>
The Search Entire Disk option in File Manager's Search dialog box
causes File Manager to search the entire partition, not the entire
disk. For example, if you want to search partitions C, D, and E, you
need to perform a separate search for each partition.
<P>
On page 124 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide," step 4 states
that after you select the Search Entire Disk check box, "File Manager
will search the entire disk drive." This is incorrect.
<P>
<P><h3>How Paintbrush Uses Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
Page 275 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0
incorrectly states:
<P>
<PRE>   The availability of point sizes depends on the resolution of your
   printer.

</PRE>It should state:
<P>
<PRE>   The availability of point sizes depends on the resolution of your
   screen.

</PRE>To determine what fonts Paintbrush will use, look at the [FONTS]
section of the WIN.INI file. Up to the first 15 fonts listed will
appear in the Fonts menu of Paintbrush. When Paintbrush selects these
fonts, it will ignore duplicate instances of the same font, showing
only the first instance.
<P>
<P><h3>SPART.PAR and 386SPART.PAR Incorrectly Described</h3>
 
<P>
Page 521 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version 3.0
incorrectly states:
<P>
<PRE>   A permanent Windows swap file consists of two hidden, write-
   protected files. The files are named SPART.PAR and 386SPART.PAR. Do
   not delete, move, or rename these files."

</PRE>The 386SPART.PAR file is hidden but not write protected, while
SPART.PAR is write protected (read-only attribute) but not hidden.
<P>
Performing a directory listing from the MS-DOS command prompt of the
Windows directory using "DIR *.PAR" will show the SPART.PAR. Through
File Manager, performing a Search for *.PAR with or without showing
HIDDEN/SYSTEMS FILES, will show both files.
<P>
<P><h3>Clicking Outside a Copied Cutout in Paintbrush</h3>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" explains how to use the mouse and
the SHIFT key to move a cutout in Paintbrush. The directions tell you
to:

<OL><P><LI>Move the cutout and release the mouse when the cutout is were you
   want to leave it.

<P><LI>Click outside the cutout to paste the cutout permanently.
<P>
</OL>However, the guide does not explain that if you don't click outside
the cutout, it will appear to work correctly. The cutout will be
pasted on the screen, but when the file is saved, it will not save the
newly pasted cutout.
<P>
<P><h3>Dithered Colored Text Can be Drawn in Paintbrush</h3>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" incorrectly states on page 277
that text can only be drawn in solid colors, and that when a dithered
color is selected, Paintbrush will use the solid color that is closest
to the selected dithered color. Paintbrush will draw text in dithered
colors.
<P>
<P><h3>Blank Window Title in PIF Editor Defaults to PIF Name</h3>
 
<P>
Pages 451 and 459 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version
3.0 incorrectly state that when creating a program information file
(PIF) and leaving the Window Title text box blank, the icon title,
when minimized, will contain the application's filename without the
extension.
<P>
If you leave the Window Title text box blank while in real, standard,
or 386 enhanced mode, the icon title does not assume the application's
filename without the extension. Rather, the icon title assumes the
name of the application's PIF without the .PIF extension.
<P>
Note: This also holds true for the title that appears in the Task List
when you press CTRL+ESC. While the manual is incorrect, the on-screen
Help program that appears when you place the cursor in the Window
Title text box and press F1 correctly states that the title bar will
display the name of the PIF without the .PIF extension.
<P>
<P><h3>Terminal Will Not Accept Eight Data Bits and Odd Parity</h3>
 
<P>
Page 339 of the "Microsoft Window User's Guide" states that when using
the Kermit protocol and eight data bits, parity can be specified as
even, odd, or none.
<P>
By definition, parity is the eighth bit. If eight data bits are
specified, parity cannot be specified (odd, even, mark or space). This
is the definition and is supported in the serial chip (Intel 8250).
<P>
Terminal simply supports the available communications protocols,
which are unrelated to the download protocol chosen (Xmodem, Kermit,
ASCII, and so on).
<P>
<P><h3>Location of Terminal Function Keys Incorrect in "User's Guide"</h3>
 
<P>
The Terminal function key chart incorrectly displays the Fx key
layouts (where x is a value between 1 and 8) on page 331 of the
"Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for Windows 3.0:
<P>
<PRE>   F1              F2              F3              F4
   F5              F6              F7              F8

</PRE></OL>The correct layout is:
<P>
<PRE>   F1              F3              F5              F7
   F2              F4              F6              F8
</PRE>
