</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Schedule+ on One Workstation with Multiple Microsoft Mail Accounts</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Schedule+.

<P><LI>Sign in with the last Microsoft Mail account created. You receive the
   error message "Your Schedule+ files could not be accessed. Is this the
   first time you are using Schedule+ on this computer?"

<P><LI>Choose Yes and confirm the Microsoft Mail password.

<P><LI>Exit and sign out of Schedule+.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 1-4 for each remaining account.
<P>
</OL><h3>Schedule+ on Workstation Without Microsoft Mail Accounts</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Schedule+. You receive the following error message:
<P>
       Until you run mail once, you will not be able to use any
       of the Workgroup features of Schedule+. Do you want to use
       only the personal features of Schedule+ now?

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.
<P>
    NOTE: You may want to create the first account with the name USER and
    a password of PASSWORD. This allows others to know the Microsoft Mail
    password without using anyone's actual password.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Mail Sign In screen, enter USER as the user name
    and PASSWORD as the password. Do not select the Remember Password
    check box. You receive the error message "Your message file could not
    be found."

<P><LI>Choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Open Message File dialog box, choose the New button. You
    receive the following message:
<P>
       Warning: The existence of multiple message files can result
       in a loss of database integrity. Delete all other message
       files. Your new message file can be found in the
       C:\&lt;WINDOWS&gt;\MSMAIL.MMF.

<P><LI>Choose OK. You receive the following message:
<P>
       A new file has been created for you. Your password has
       been set to 'password'. You can change it by using the
       Change Password command.

<P><LI>Choose OK. From the Schedule+ Options menu, choose General Options.
    Select Startup Off-Line and then choose OK.

<P><LI>Exit and sign out of Schedule+.

<P><LI>Start Schedule+.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Mail Sign In screen, enter USER as the user name
    and PASSWORD as the password. You receive the following error
    message:
<P>
       This message file is a backup file. Would you like to make
       it your primary message file?

<P><LI>Choose the Yes button. Exit and sign out of Schedule+.

<P><LI>Start Schedule+.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Mail Sign In screen, enter a new user's name
    as the user name and PASSWORD as the password.

<P><LI>Choose OK. You receive the following error message:
<P>
       The local copy of your schedule file could not be accessed
       in the location specified in your SCHDPLUS.INI file.

<P><LI>Choose OK.

<P><LI>In the Find Local File dialog box, choose OK to accept the filename
    &lt;username&gt;.CAL. You receive the following message:
<P>
       A new file has been created for you. Your password has been
       set to 'password'. You can change it by using the Change
       Password command.

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
    NOTE: The Microsoft Mail message file and the Schedule+ file both have
    a password of PASSWORD. If you leave these passwords both set to
    PASSWORD, users will not need to confirm the Schedule+ password when
    they start Schedule+.

<P><LI>To change the Schedule+ password, choose Change Password from the
    Schedule+ Options menu. You will be prompted for the current password
    and the new password you want to use.
<P>
    NOTE: When the user logs in to Schedule+, he or she needs to use his
    or her Mailbox name and PASSWORD as the password and then enter his or
    her Schedule+ password in the Confirm Password box.

<P><LI>Exit and sign out of Schedule+.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 12-18 for each additional account.
