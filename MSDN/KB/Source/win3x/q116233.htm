</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
When you are using the Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 NWLINK.386
file to connect to a network that uses a Cisco router, the following
problems may occur:

<UL><LI>Windows for Workgroups workstations configured with the "IPX/SPX
   Compatible Transport with NetBIOS" option cannot communicate across
   a Cisco router when both Novell(R) routing and DECnet(TM) routing
   are enabled.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>A Windows for Workgroups workstation displays the "Error 51:
   Failure to Connect" message in response to the NET USE
   \\&lt;SERVER&gt;\&lt;SHARENAME&gt; COMMAND.
<P>
</UL>These problems occur when NWLINK.386 does not correctly handle certain
Cisco router addresses that begin with the letter A. Any address with
the high-order bit set on an end or intermediate system results in
NWNBlink truncating the routing address, which causes the network
connection to fail.
<P>
The WG1027 disk included with this Application Note contains a revised
NWLINK.386 file that corrects this problem.
<P>
<P><h3>To install the new NWLINK.386 file</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Windows for Workgroups.

<P><LI>Make a backup copy of the currently installed NWLINK.386 file by
   typing the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then pressing
   ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren &lt;drive:path&gt;\nwlink.386 nwlink.old
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive:path&gt; is the location of your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory.
<P>
   For example, if your Windows directory is called WINDOWS and is on
   drive C, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
   press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren c:\windows\system\nwlink.386 nwlink.old
</PRE>
<P><LI>Insert the enclosed WG1027 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive.

<P><LI>To copy the file to the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, type the
   following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\nwlink.386 &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the WG1027 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory of your Windows SYSTEM
   subdirectory.
<P>
   For example, if the WG1027 disk is in drive A and your Windows
   directory is called WINDOWS and is on drive C, type the following
   at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\nwlink.386 c:\windows\system
