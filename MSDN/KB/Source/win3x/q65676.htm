The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You may get the message: "Cannot disable A20" when the HIMEM.SYS file
is loaded.
<P>
The A20 line is the key to the first 64K of memory above the first megabyte
of memory in the computer (also known as the High Memory Area or HMA). It
is necessary that HIMEM.SYS enable this line; however, it is not necessary
that HIMEM.SYS disable it. If the line cannot be disabled, there is a risk
that other applications will use this line, possibly resulting in damage to
HIMEM.SYS code and a loss of functionality.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible causes for this message:

<UL><LI>Another application is already using the A20 line when HIMEM.SYS
   tries to disable it. Check the CONFIG.SYS file for applications
   that are using the high-memory area (for example, VDISK, old
   versions of QEMM, or 386 to the Max). Either REMark these
   applications out or ensure HIMEM.SYS is loaded first in the
   CONFIG.SYS. Reboot the machine to check if this solves the
   problem.

<LI>The hardware in the computer does not support disabling the A20
   line. Although the problem can be in the design of the
   motherboard, usually the BIOS is responsible. An upgrade of the
   system BIOS may solve the problem. However, if the problem lies
   in the design of the motherboard, there is no workaround for this.
