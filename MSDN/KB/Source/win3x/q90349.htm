The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows for Workgroups ClipBook Viewer offers the options Full Access
and Read Only when a page is shared. This article describes what these mean
and when each should be used.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Although your own shared ClipBook pages are never changed by someone
accessing them through their ClipBook viewer, some ClipBook pages contain a
reference to the application that created the original page information.
These pages can be used to establish a link to that application and receive
updates when the information changes. The application that contains the
original information and provides updates is called the "server
application." The application that receives the updated information is
called the "client application."
<P>
In addition to receiving information from the server application, some
client applications may provide ways to make changes to the original data.
If you grant Full Access to a share, you allow the client applications of
this type to change your data.
<P>
If you grant Read Only access to a share, clients can receive updates but
cannot change your information.
<P>
NOTE: "Editing the linked object" is not supported for network links
and is not affected by the Read Only or Full Access settings.
<P>
