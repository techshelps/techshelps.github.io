The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article summarizes the Print Screen capabilities in Microsoft
Windows. The following topics are discussed:

<UL><LI>Full Screen MS-DOS-Based Application
<LI>Windows-based and Windowed MS-DOS-Based Applications
<LI>Modifying the Image
<LI>Print Screen from MS-DOS-Based Application to Printer Using Windows
<LI>Printing a Windows Application Screen to a Printer
<P>
</UL>Windows has three different Print Screen capabilities: full screen to
the Clipboard, active windows to the Clipboard, and MS-DOS-based
application (full screen to printer) in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
The PRINT SCREEN key combinations behave differently when you run an
MS-DOS-based application full screen than when the application is
windowed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Full-Screen MS-DOS-Based Application (Windows 3.x and Windows 95)</h3>
 
<P>
Pressing the PRINT SCREEN key or ALT+PRINT SCREEN captures the entire
screen and places the text in the Clipboard. If your MS-DOS-based
application runs in text mode, the data is copied to the Clipboard as
straight ASCII text. If the MS-DOS-based application runs in graphics
mode, the data is copied to the Clipboard as a bitmap.
<P>
Windows-Based and Windowed MS-DOS-Based Applications (Windows 3.x and
Windows 95)
 
<P>
When you are using Windows-based or windowed MS-DOS-based applications,
pressing the PRINT SCREEN key copies the entire screen to the Clipboard.
Pressing ALT+PRINT SCREEN copies the image of the current window to the
Clipboard.
<P>
<P><h3>Modifying the Image (Windows 3.x and Windows 95)</h3>
 
<P>
If you only want a portion of the window, or you want to modify the
graphic, you can paste the image into Paintbrush, make modifications
if you choose, and then copy a portion or all of the image back to the
Clipboard. The image can also be saved as a .BMP or .PCX file at this
point.
<P>
Print Screen from MS-DOS-Based Application to Printer Using Windows
(Windows 3.x)
 
<P>
When you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode you can print an
MS-DOS-based application's screen contents directly to a printer, by
doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>Using PIF Editor, open the PIF file for the MS-DOS application
   from which you want to print the screen.

<P><LI>Choose the Advanced button.

<P><LI>In the Other Options box, select the PrtSc and Alt+PrtSc check
   boxes.
<P>
</OL>This feature is not available in real mode (Windows 3.0 only) or
standard mode.
<P>
If you clear the PrtSc and Alt+PrtSc check boxes, nothing happens. If
you do not disable these shortcut keys, the screen or current
application's screen is copied to the Clipboard.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.0 in
real and standard modes, and in Windows 3.1 in standard mode. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h3>Printing a Windows-Based Application Screen to a Printer (Windows 3.x)</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot print a screen image to a printer from a Windows-based
application by using the PRINT SCREEN key. However, you can copy the
image to Paintbrush and print the image. You can automate this process
by creating a Recorder macro.
<P>
To write a macro that captures a screen image from a Windows
application to the Clipboard and then prints through Paintbrush, do
the following:

<OL><P><LI>Minimize all applications except Program Manager.

<P><LI>Run Paintbrush (do not minimize).

<P><LI>From the Options menu, choose Image Attributes. In the Image
    Attributes dialog box, choose the Default button.

<P><LI>Run File Manager (do not minimize).

<P><LI>Run Recorder (do not minimize).

<P><LI>Minimize Program Manager.

<P><LI>From the Macro menu in Recorder, choose Record.

<P><LI>Enter a macro name under Record Macro Name.

<P><LI>Choose a shortcut key combination under Shortcut Key.

<P><LI>Under Playback To, choose Any Application.

<P><LI>Under Record Mouse, choose Ignore Mouse.

<P><LI>Choose Start.

<P><LI>Press PRINT SCREEN.

<P><LI>Press CTRL+ESC.

<P><LI>Press P+ENTER.

<P><LI>Press ALT+V, then the O key.

<P><LI>Press ALT+E, then the P key. Repeat this command once to paste
    the image into Paintbrush.

<P><LI>Press ALT+V, then the I key.

<P><LI>Press ALT+F, then the P key.

<P><LI>Press ENTER.

<P><LI>Press CTRL+ESC.

<P><LI>Press DOWN ARROW.

<P><LI>Press ENTER.

<P><LI>Press CTRL+BREAK.

<P><LI>Choose Save Macro.

<P><LI>Choose OK.

<P><LI>From the File menu in Recorder, choose Save.

<P><LI>Enter the macro filename and press ENTER.
<P>
</OL>Paintbrush must be open and not minimized to use this Macro. Also,
there must be at least one non-minimized application open other than
Paintbrush when the macro executes. To execute the macro, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Open Recorder.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open.

<P><LI>Enter the macro filename and press ENTER (or set the macro up as
   an icon in Program Manager and execute it).

<P><LI>Activate the Paintbrush window.

<P><LI>Activate the window of another non-minimized application.

<P><LI>Execute the macro by pressing the shortcut key combination you
   selected when you recorded the macro.
<P>
</OL>This should copy the image to the Clipboard, paste it into Paintbrush,
and send it to the selected printer. Steps 1 to 3 need only be done
once per session.
<P>
NOTE: You cannot print another screen until Paintbrush has finished
printing the first one to Print Manager.
