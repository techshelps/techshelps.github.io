The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows version 1.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Rooms or other physical items, such as a conference room or vehicle,
can be set up as a resource to be scheduled using Microsoft's
Schedule+ program included with Windows for Workgroups (WFWG).
<P>
Only the postoffice administrator can set up a resource to be
scheduled.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Workgroups for Windows Mail Postoffice (WGPO) and Windows for
Workgroups Schedule+ must be installed and set up before beginning
this process.

<OL><P><LI>The Mail Postoffice administrator needs to create an account for the
   room. An example would be for the Conference room #1.

<P><LI>Create a mail account called CONFER1 for the Name and CONFER1 for
   the Mailbox. The password must be the same as the administrator's
   password for the Mail Postoffice.

<P><LI>Exit and sign out of Mail and Schedule+.

<P><LI>Rename the MSMAIL.MMF file in your local Windows directory.

<P><LI>Start Schedule+. When it prompts for a name and password, use
   CONFER1 as the name and enter the password. This starts the account
   for this room.

<P><LI>From the Schedule+ Options menu, choose General Options. Select
   This Account Is For A Resource, then chose OK.

<P><LI>If each person running Schedule+ is to have the ability to add
   and delete appointments for the room CONFER1, follow these steps.

   and modifying the times for the room CONFER1, do the following:
<P>
   a. From the Options menu, choose Set Access Privileges.
   b. Set the default Privilege to "Read Appointments &amp; Tasks."
   c. Select the Add option and choose the person who is to be in
