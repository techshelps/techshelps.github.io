    Questions and Answers: Installing Windows 3.0 from Floppy Disks
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Q. When I try to set up Windows, why does it keep asking me for
      disk number 2 even when disk 2 is in my floppy drive?

   A. If Windows Setup asks for disk 2 when disk 2 is already in the
      floppy drive, there could be a problem with your computer's
      floppy drive, interference from memory-resident programs, or a
      problem with the Windows disk. The following answer covers
      floppy drive problems. In the answer to the next question, we'll
      cover checking the Windows disks and checking for
      memory-resident software.

      To test your floppy drive:

      a. Remove all disks from the floppy drives and reboot your
         computer.

      b. Put Windows disk 1 into the drive and use the DOS DIR command
         to do a directory listing.

      c. Remove the disk from the floppy drive and repeat the DOS DIR
         command with the floppy drive empty.

      If DOS gives the error "Not ready reading drive A," your drive
      is probably working correctly.

      If DOS gives a file list on step c when the drive is empty, or
      if DOS tries to do a directory listing and then gives you an
      error, your computer may need servicing.

2. Q. When I try to set up Windows, Setup asks me for the next disk
      even if that disk is already in the drive. What can I do about
      this problem?

   A. Setup may not be able to find the next file it needs to copy,
      perhaps because of an improperly labeled or bad disk. This
      problem can also be caused by memory-resident programs
      interfering with Windows Setup.

      It's rare for an original Windows disk to be mislabeled. If
      you are installing from backup copies and suspect that they
      may be mislabeled, try your other backup disks to see if
      Windows Setup recognizes one of them as the disk its looking
      for, or run Setup with your original Windows disks, with
      write-protection on.

      It's also rare that a customer receives a defective original
      disk. To test your disks:

      a. Use the DOS DIR command to list the contents of each original
         Windows disk. All Windows disks should give normal directory
         listings. If you cannot get a directory listing or if there
         are some garbled filenames, you probably have a bad disk.

      b. If the DOS DIR command works correctly, then use the DOS COPY
         command to copy the files from each original Windows disk to
         a temporary directory on your hard drive. If you receive a
         DOS error message during this process, you probably have a
         bad disk.

         If either of these tests indicates a bad original Windows
         disk, call Microsoft Customer Service at (800) 426-9400 to
         arrange for replacement disks.

         If either of these tests indicates a bad original Windows
         disk, call Microsoft Customer Service at (800) 426-9400 to
         arrange for replacement disks.

         To make sure that a memory-resident program does not
         interfere with Windows Setup, perform the following steps.
         You may want to refer to your DOS manual for additional
         information.

      a. Make a bootable floppy disk by using the DOS FORMAT command
         with the forward slash S (/S) option:

            FORMAT A: /S

      b. Create a CONFIG.SYS file on that disk that reads:

            FILES=20
            BUFFERS=20

         If you use a word processor to create this file, be sure to
         save the file to the floppy disk as a text file.

      c. Reboot your computer with this floppy disk in drive A, and
         then continue with the normal Windows setup.

         This procedure assures that there are no memory-resident
         programs loaded when you run Windows Setup. If this procedure
         does not solve your problem, contact your local computer
         support person or call Microsoft Product Support at (425)
         637-7098.

3. Q. When I run Windows Setup, it gets part way through disk 2 and
      then the screen goes blank. What is the problem?

   A. If Setup hangs while copying files from disk 2, most likely it
      is having a problem either with memory-resident software or with
      special hardware in your computer.

      The following steps may resolve this problem. Use your original
      Windows disks, set to write-protected. These procedures do not
      apply to installing Windows for shared use on a network, and may
      not work if your hard drive uses special partitioning software.

      a. To make sure that a memory-resident program does not
         interfere with Windows Setup, perform the procedure described
         in steps 2a, 2b, and 2c above. You may want to refer to your
         DOS manual for additional information.

      b. Boot from your floppy disk that you prepared, then insert
         Windows disk 1. At the A:\ prompt, enter SETUP /I. The /I
         option prevents Setup from detecting hardware components.
         Change the settings as needed to match your computer,
         following the instructions on each Setup screen. Refer to the
         written "Hardware Compatibility List" included with the
         Windows packaged product. Find the name of your computer on
         this list. If there is an asterisk after your computer's
         name, go to the top option in Setup and select your computer.

      c. On the Setup screen that lists your computer's configuration,
         make sure that it is set for NO NETWORK and NO MOUSE. Trying
         Setup with these features turned off may allow Setup to
         finish. If you need network or mouse support, you can run
         Setup again later from Windows to add these. Appendix A, page
         559, in your "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for version
         3.0, gives step-by-step instructions for running Setup from
         Windows to modify an existing installation.

         If this does not solve your problem, contact your local
         computer support person or call Microsoft Windows Product
         Support at (425) 637-7098.
