The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The initial release of Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.0 came
with run-time versions of Asymetrix DayBook and ToolBook. Microsoft was
responsible for supporting these run-time versions. As of the release of
the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, Asymetrix is
responsible for supporting all versions of DayBook and ToolBook.
<P>
This article includes information on some specific problems with
DayBook and ToolBook and possible solutions or workarounds.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Can't Drag Icons When Mouse Buttons Are Swapped</h3>
 
<P>
DayBook version 1.0 with the run-time version of ToolBook does not
allow you to drag icons when the mouse buttons are reversed or swapped
in Control Panel. To work around this behavior, click both the mouse
buttons in quick succession; for example, if the right button is the
"active" button, quickly click the right button, then click and hold
down the left button.
<P>
<P><h3>Error When Compiling Script</h3>
 
<P>
"Error when compiling script: Syntax Error" may occur when DayBook is
running and either Setup Applications is started from the Windows
Setup Options menu or Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows is being set
up. Quit DayBook and run Setup again.
<P>
<P><h3>Valid Dates Problem</h3>
 
<P>
"Valid dates for this version of DayBook are 1-1-91 through 12-31-91.
Please check your system date" may occur when the internal clock
reaches 1992. According to Asymetrix, this problem occurs only in
ToolBook's DayBook version 1.5, in both the full and run-time
versions. There are two solutions to this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Download DB15FIX.ZIP from the Asymetrix bulletin board service
   (BBS) at (425) 451-1173.

<P><LI>If the full version of ToolBook 1.5 is being used, the DAYBOOK.SBK
   script file can be edited; the following two changes need to be
   made:
<P>
   a. Change "12-31-91" to "12-31-93".
   b. Change "12,31,91" to "12,31,93".
<P>
</OL>ToolBook and DayBook are manufactured by Asymetrix, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
