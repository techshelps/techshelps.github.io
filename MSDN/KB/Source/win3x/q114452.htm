The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You receive the following error when receiving a file using Windows
Terminal:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot create specified file. Make sure that:

      You have enough disk space.
      The file is not read-only.
      The filename is valid.

</PRE>You may receive this error when you are using either the Receive Text File
or Receive Binary File command on the Transfers menu in Terminal.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Any of the following conditions can cause this error message:

<UL><LI>There is not enough free disk space for the downloaded file.

<LI>The file to be downloaded is read only.

<LI>The filename is invalid. The filename is not valid if an extension for
   the filename was not supplied. Any three-character extension is
   accepted. In versions of Windows earlier than 3.1, an extension was not
   required.

<LI>The FileAssist feature of Norton Desktop for Windows 3.0 is being used.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure sufficient disk space exists on the destination drive for the
file to be downloaded. Also, make sure that a valid filename (including an
extension) is being used for the file to be downloaded and that the file is
not marked read only.
<P>
If you are using Norton Desktop for Windows, disable the FileAssist feature
for Terminal with the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save As.

<P><LI>In the FileAssist File Save As dialog box, choose Config.

<P><LI>Clear the "FileAssist Enabled for Terminal" check box.

<P><LI>Choose OK. (FileAssist warns you that it will be disabled for Terminal.)

<P><LI>Choose Yes to continue.

<P><LI>Choose Cancel to close the File Save As dialog box.
<P>
</OL>FileAssist is disabled for Terminal only after you have closed the dialog
box.
<P>
NOTE: FileAssist can be re-enabled from Norton Desktop's Control Center
application. If you need assistance in disabling FileAssist for Terminal or
any other application, contact Symantec Technical Support.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>

Desktop for Windows. For more information, contact Symantec Technical
Support at (541) 465-8600 or through its CompuServe support forum (type "go

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
FileAssist is a Common Dialog replacement that adds "on-the-fly" features
to the Open, Save, and Save As dialog boxes. FileAssist features include
View File, File Search, Create Directory, Rename File, and Delete File.
