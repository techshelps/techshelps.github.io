</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
The WG1126 disk included with this Application Note contains an
updated version of the AWFAXIO.DLL file that corrects a problem
associated with some fax modems that use a Rockwell chip. If you have
a fax modem with a Rockwell chip (for example, the Megahertz XJACK)
and are using Microsoft At Work PC Fax, your system may stop
responding (hang) during the initialization process. To determine
whether the updated AWFAXIO.DLL file is needed, perform the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open Windows Terminal (usually located in the Accessories group).

<P><LI>Type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      AT*F2
</PRE><P>
</OL>If this command displays the message "Download Initiated" and your
system then hangs, install the updated AWFAXIO.DLL file.
<P>
The previous version of the AWFAXIO.DLL file from Microsoft At Work PC
Fax sends an *F2 command to the modem to force XON/XOFF flow control.
This command causes the Rockwell chip to start a Flash ROM download
routine. The updated version of AWFAXIO.DLL does not contain the *F2
command.
<P>
<P><h3>To Install the Updated File</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert the enclosed WG1126 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\awfaxio.dll &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the WG1126 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where your AWFAXIO.DLL
   file currently resides. For example, if the WG1126 disk is in drive
   A and Windows for Workgroups is installed on drive C in a directory
   called Windows, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\awfaxio.dll c:\windows\system
</OL></PRE>
