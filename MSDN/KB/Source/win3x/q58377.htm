<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses some common File Manager usage problems in Microsoft
Windows 3.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>When File Manager Updates Its Display</h3>
 
<P>
Windows File Manager's directory list window updates automatically
when files are changed, added, or deleted under the following
circumstances only:

<UL><LI>If a Windows-based application makes the change and uses proper
   Windows calls to do so

<LI>If an MS-DOS-based application running under Windows in 386 enhanced
   mode makes the change, and the SYSTEM.INI setting FileSysChange is
   set to YES (the default):
<P>
<P><PRE>      FileSysChange=yes
</PRE><P>
   Files changed by MS-DOS-based applications running from Windows
   in real or standard mode will not update File Manager. To update the
   directory list display, choose Refresh from the Windows menu, or
   press F5.
<P>
</UL><h3>Search Window Not Updated</h3>
 
<P>
If you move, delete, or rename a file from the File Manager Search
window with the mouse, the Search window is correctly updated.
However, if you move, delete, or rename a file by choosing Move from
the File menu, the Search window isn't updated.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows versions 3.0
and 3.0a. This problem was corrected in Windows version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Network Drives Not Updated</h3>
 
<P>
File Manager's active drive listing includes any network drives to
which a connection has been established prior to running Microsoft
Windows.
<P>
Additional drives may be added by choosing the Connect Net Drive
command from the Disk menu. If a third-party utility is used to
establish network connections, File Manager's drive list does not
update, and the drives are not available in File Manager. The only way
to update the drive list without closing and restarting File Manager
is to connect to or disconnect from a network drive through File
Manager, at which point File Manager rereads and updates the drive
list.
<P>
If a third-party utility establishes or removes network connections,
connecting or disconnecting a drive through File Manager forces File
Manager to update its drive list, which will then include all changes
made by the third-party network utility.
<P>
Note that the Refresh command on the Window menu only refreshes the
directory tree -- not the drive list. Choosing this command does not
make the network drives available.
