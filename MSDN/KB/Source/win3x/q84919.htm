<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When the Microsoft Windows Terminal accessory application is used on
an ANSI-based system, the screen may become corrupt, with portions of
the screen appearing in the correct locations and others overwriting
other portions or appearing on the left margin. This problem may occur
even though the terminal emulation is set to DEC VT-100 (ANSI).
<P>
Although VT-100 codes are very similar to ANSI, two functions used by
ANSI-based systems are not present in the VT-100 command set. These
are the Save and Restore Cursor Position commands. These ANSI commands
are ignored by Terminal, which causes the cursor to be in the wrong
position as more ANSI commands are sent. This makes the screen appear
disjointed or broken up.
<P>
To work around this problem, use a straight ASCII, non-graphics mode
from the host or recreate the ANSI menus on the host to remove these
commands.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Save Cursor Position command is &lt;esc&gt;[s and the Restore Cursor
Position command is &lt;esc&gt;[u. These commands are typically used to
shorten a stream of ANSI characters. When you are creating a menu with
an ANSI editor, the editor will typically ask for the maximum line
length. This will determine the number of codes and text sent on one
line.
<P>
For example, if the line length is set to 80, the editor will send no
more than 80 characters before forcing a carriage return and linefeed.
If there were a number of color or attribute changes on that line, it
may not have finished drawing the line. Rather than remembering the
absolute location on the screen where it needs to resume, it inserts a
Save Cursor Position command before sending the carriage
return-linefeed (&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;) combination.
<P>
At the beginning of the new line, the editor can then issue a Restore
Cursor Position command to return the cursor to the end of the
previous line and continue where it was interrupted. When Terminal is
used, the Restore Cursor Position command will be ignored and the line
will be restarted from the left margin where the cursor was placed
by the &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; combination.
<P>
It is usually possible to select an option when creating these menus
to avoid the use of the Save and Restore Cursor Position commands. If
the maximum line length function is ignored, these commands will
normally not be used.
