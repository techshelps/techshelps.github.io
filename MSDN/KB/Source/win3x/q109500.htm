The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11 SYSINI.WRI.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
[386Enh] Section Settings
<P>
The [386Enh] section contains information used for virtual-memory
page swapping; virtual-memory network drivers; and 32-bit disk
access, file access, and SCSI port drivers.
<P>
The [386Enh] section can contain the following settings:
____________________________________________________________
32BitDiskAccess=&lt;on-or-off&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     Off
Purpose:     If on, this setting attempts to use 32-bit disk
</PRE>access for all disk drives. If your disk drive controllers cannot
support 32-bit disk access, this setting may still show as on.
____________________________________________________________
AllVMsExclusive=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     False
Purpose:     If enabled, this setting forces all applications to
</PRE>run in exclusive full-screen mode, overriding all contrary settings
in the applications' program information files (PIFs). Enabling this
setting might prolong the length of the Windows session when you are
running network and memory-resident software that is incompatible
with Windows for Workgroups.
____________________________________________________________
COMBoostTime=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     2
Purpose:     Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to
</PRE>allow a virtual machine to process a COM interrupt. If, while running
a communications application, you lose keyboard characters on the
screen, you can try increasing this value.
____________________________________________________________
COMMdrv30=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     False
Purpose:     If enabled, the Virtual COM Driver (VCD) uses its own
</PRE>copy of the interrupt handler for the serial communications driver.
This  improves performance of your COM ports. Enable this setting if
you are using a Windows version 3.0 serial communications driver.
Disable this setting if you are using the standard Windows version
3.1 serial communications driver.
____________________________________________________________
COM1FIFO=&lt;0-or-1&gt;
COM2FIFO=&lt;0-or-1&gt;
COM3FIFO=&lt;0-or-1&gt;
COM4FIFO=&lt;0-or-1&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     True
Purpose:     Specifies whether the FIFO buffer of a COM port's
</PRE>16550 Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) should be
enabled (True) or disabled (False). If a serial port does not have a
16550 UART, this setting is ignored.
<P>
____________________________________________________________
COMIrqSharing=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     True for Micro Channel Architecture and EISA
</PRE>machines; False for all other machines.
<PRE>Purpose:     Specifies whether COM interrupt lines are sharable
</PRE>between multiple serial ports or with other devices. Enable this
setting if your machine uses the same interrupt for COM3 or COM4 as
it does for COM1 or COM2.
____________________________________________________________
DOSPromptExitInstruc=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     Yes
Purpose:     If this setting is enabled, when you start MS-DOS
</PRE>Prompt, a message appears with instructions on how to exit and switch
away from MS-DOS Prompt. Disable this setting if you do not want to
see the message.
____________________________________________________________
DualDisplay=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     See "Purpose" below.
Purpose:     Typically, the memory between B000:0000 and B7FF:000F
</PRE>is used by the general system unless a secondary display is detected.
Enable this setting if you are using a VGA-based color display and
want EMM386.EXE to include this address space as an upper memory
block (UMB). In addition to enabling this setting, you must include
the i= option in the device=EMM386.EXE command line in your
CONFIG.SYS file as follows:
<P>
<PRE>          device=EMM386.EXE  i=B000-B7FF

</PRE>If this setting is disabled, the address range is available on EGA
systems, but not on VGA systems, because the VGA display device
supports monochrome modes, which use this address space.
____________________________________________________________
EMMExclude=&lt;paragraph-range&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     None
Purpose:     Specifies a range of memory that Windows for
</PRE>Workgroups will not scan to find unused address space. This has the
side effect of turning off the RAM and ROM search code for the range.
The range (two paragraph values separated by a hyphen) must be
between A000 and EFFF. This scanning can interfere with some adapters
that use the same memory area. The starting value is rounded down and
the ending value is rounded up to a multiple of 16K. For example, you
could set EMMExclude=C800-CFFF to prevent Windows for Workgroups from
scanning the addresses C800:0000 through CFFF:000F. You can specify
more than one range by including more than one EMMExclude line.
____________________________________________________________
EMMInclude=&lt;paragraph-range&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     None
Purpose:     Specifies a range of memory that Windows for
</PRE>Workgroups will treat as unused address space regardless of what may
be there. EMMInclude takes precedence over EMMExclude if you specify
ranges that overlap. The range (two values separated by a hyphen)
must be between A000 and EFFF. The starting value is rounded down and
the ending value is rounded up to a multiple of 16K. For example, you
could set EMMInclude=C800-CFFF to ensure that Windows for Workgroups
can use the addresses C800:0000 through CFFF:000F. You may specify
more than one range by including more than one EMMInclude line.
____________________________________________________________
EMMPageFrame=&lt;paragraph&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     None
Purpose:     Specifies the starting paragraph where the 64K page
</PRE>frame will begin when Windows for Workgroups cannot find a suitable
page frame. Allows an EMM page frame in an area containing some
unused RAM or ROM. For example, you could set EMMPageFrame=C400 to
start the page frame at C400:0000.
____________________________________________________________
EMMSize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     65536
Purpose:     Specifies the total amount of memory available for
</PRE>mapping as expanded memory. The default value allocates the maximum
possible amount of system memory as expanded memory. Specify a value
for this setting if you run an application that allocates all of the
available expanded memory. If this is the case, you cannot create new
virtual machines. If this value is zero, no expanded memory is
allocated, but the EMM driver will load. To disable EMM and prevent
the EMM driver from loading, use the NoEMMDriver setting.
____________________________________________________________
EnableSharingPopUps=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     False
Purpose:     Specifies whether a SHARE.EXE sharing-violation
</PRE>message should appear when a sharing violation occurs while you are
using VSHARE. If this setting is enabled, the SHARE.EXE messages will
appear. If this setting is disabled, the SHARE.EXE message will not
appear and you will not be notified of a sharing violation. Enable
this setting if you are using an MS-DOS based application that relies
on the sharing-violation message.
____________________________________________________________
FileSysChange=&lt;on-or-off&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     Off
Purpose:     Indicates whether File Manager automatically updates
</PRE>file information any time an MS-DOS based application creates,
renames, or deletes a file. If this setting is disabled, a virtual
machine can run exclusively, even if it modifies files. Enabling this
setting can slow system performance significantly. If you are sharing
directories and someone else changes the contents of your directories
by using an MS-DOS based application, File Manager does not update
the directory or file information, even if this setting is enabled.
____________________________________________________________
InDOSPolling=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     No
Purpose:     If enabled, prevents Windows for Workgroups from
</PRE>running other applications when memory-resident software has the
InDOS flag set. Enabling this setting is necessary if the
memory-resident software needs to be in a critical section to do
operations off an INT21 hook, but will slow system performance
slightly.
____________________________________________________________
INT28Critical=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     True
Purpose:     Specifies whether a critical section is needed to
</PRE>handle INT28h interrupts used by memory-resident software. Some
networks do internal task switching on INT28h interrupts. These
interrupts might lock up some network software, indicating the need
for an INT28h critical section. If you are not using such software,
you might improve Windows task switching by disabling this setting.
____________________________________________________________
LocalReboot=&lt;on-or-off&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     On
Purpose:     Specifies whether you can press CTRL+ALT+DEL to quit
</PRE>applications that cause an unrecoverable error. If this setting is
enabled, you can quit the applications without restarting Windows for
Workgroups. If this setting is disabled, pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL will
restart your entire system.
____________________________________________________________
MaxBPs=&lt;number&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     200
Purpose:     Specifies the maximum number of break points (a
</PRE>method for transferring control to Windows) that can be used by the
virtual-memory manager. You may need to increase this value if you
are using Microsoft C version 7.0 or a third-party virtual-device
driver that requires more break points than the default value.
____________________________________________________________
MaxCOMPort=&lt;number&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     4
Purpose:     Specifies the maximum number of COM ports supported.
</PRE>Change this value if you have more than four COM ports installed in
your computer.
____________________________________________________________
NetAsynchFallback=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     False
Purpose:     If this setting is enabled, Windows for Workgroups
</PRE>attempts to save a failing NetBIOS request. When an application
issues an asynchronous NetBIOS request, Windows for Workgroups
attempts to allocate space in its global network buffer to receive
the data. If there is insufficient space in the global buffer,
Windows for Workgroups typically fails the NetBIOS request. If this
setting is enabled, Windows for Workgroups attempts to save such a
request by allocating a buffer in local memory and preventing any
other virtual machines from running until the data is received or the
time-out period (specified by the NetAsynchTimeout setting) expires.
____________________________________________________________
NetAsynchTimeout=&lt;seconds&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     5.0
Purpose:     Specifies the time-out period (in seconds) when
</PRE>Windows for Workgroups will enter a critical section in order to
service an asynchronous NetBIOS request. It is used only when the
NetAsynchFallback setting is enabled. This value can include a
decimal (such as 0.5).
____________________________________________________________
NetCard=&lt;list-of-filenames&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     None (Setup sets this value to match your configuration.)
Purpose:     Specifies the virtual-device driver(s) for your
</PRE>network adapter that Windows for Workgroups uses. This driver is
loaded when Windows for Workgroups starts, unless the equivalent
real-mode driver has already been loaded or Windows for Workgroups is
started with the /n switch.
____________________________________________________________
NetCard3=&lt;list-of-filenames&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     None (Setup sets this value to match your configuration.)
Purpose:     Specifies the virtual-device driver(s) for your
</PRE>network adapter that Windows for Workgroups uses. Setup uses this
parameter only if there is no equivalent real-mode driver for the
network adapter card specified. This driver is loaded when Windows
for Workgroups starts, unless Windows for Workgroups is started with
the /n switch.
____________________________________________________________
NetDMASize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     32 on Micro Channel Architecture machines (IBM PS/2
</PRE>or compatible); 0 on non-Micro Channel Architecture machines (IBM
PC/AT or compatible)
<PRE>Purpose:     Specifies the DMA buffer size (in kilobytes) for
</PRE>NetBIOS transport software if a network has been installed. In this
case, the buffer size is the larger of this value or the value of
DMABufferSize.
____________________________________________________________
NetHeapSize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     12
Purpose:     Specifies the size (in kilobytes) of the
</PRE>data-transfer buffers in conventional memory that Windows for
Workgroups allocates for transferring data over a network. This
setting is needed only if you are using real-mode protocols. It is
not required if you are using the NETBEUI.386 protocol. All values
are rounded up to the nearest 4K.
____________________________________________________________
NetMisc=&lt;list-of-filenames&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     None (Setup sets this value to match your configuration.)
Purpose:     Specifies virtual-device drivers needed to run your
</PRE>network software. These drivers are loaded when Windows for
Workgroups starts, unless Windows for Workgroups is started with the
/n switch.
____________________________________________________________
Network=&lt;list-of-filenames-or-devicenames&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     None (Setup sets this value to match your configuration)
Purpose:     Specifies the virtual-network drivers that Windows
</PRE>for Workgroups uses.
____________________________________________________________
ReflectDosInt2A=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     False
Purpose:     Indicates whether Windows for Workgroups should
</PRE>consume or reflect DOS INT 2A signals. The default means Windows for
Workgroups will consume these signals and therefore run more
efficiently. Enable this setting if you are running memory-resident
software that relies on detecting INT2A messages.
____________________________________________________________
SecondNet=&lt;filename&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     None (Setup sets this value to match your configuration.)
Purpose:     Specifies the virtual-network drivers for the
</PRE>networks you have added support for additional networks installed
during Setup.
____________________________________________________________
SyncTime=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     True
Purpose:     If this setting is enabled, Windows for Workgroups
</PRE>periodically synchronizes its time with the computer's CMOS clock. If
this setting is disabled, Windows for Workgroups usually maintains
the correct time, unless TrapTimerPorts is disabled and you are
running applications that can cause the system time to run faster or
slower than the actual time. This setting is related to the
TrapTimerPorts setting.
____________________________________________________________
TimerCriticalSection=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     0
Purpose:     Instructs Windows for Workgroups to go into a
</PRE>critical section around all timer interrupt code and specifies a
time-out period (in milliseconds). Specifying a positive value causes
only one virtual machine at a time to receive timer interrupts. Some
networks, protocols, and other global memory-resident software may
fail unless this setting is used. However, using this setting slows
performance and can make the system seem to stop for short periods of
time.
____________________________________________________________
Transport=&lt;list-of-filenames&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     netbeui.386 (Microsoft NetBEUI)
Purpose:     Specifies the network-protocol virtual-device-driver
</PRE>file that Windows for Workgroups uses.
____________________________________________________________
TrapTimerPorts=&lt;boolean&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     True
Purpose:     Specifies whether Windows for Workgroups should trap
</PRE>read and write operations to the system timer ports that are
performed by applications. If this setting is disabled, Windows for
Workgroups will not trap these operations, allowing applications that
frequently read or write to the timer to run faster. However, this
may interfere with the ability of Windows for Workgroups to keep
accurate system time. If this setting is disabled, Windows for
Workgroups can usually detect when an application has changed the
timer interrupt interval and then make any adjustments to the time.
If your system's time appears to be running fast or slow, enable this
setting. If you do not want to enable this setting, enable the
SyncTime setting. This causes Windows for Workgroups to check the
time periodically and then make any necessary adjustments.
____________________________________________________________
V86ModeLANAs=&lt;lana number, lana number&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     None
Purpose:     Specifies the LANA numbers for all the real-mode
</PRE>protocols and NetBIOS's that Windows for Workgroups recognizes. This
setting is for real-mode protocols and NetBIOS's only. This setting
should not include any LANA numbers for protected-mode protocols or
NetBIOS's. If you start the network before starting Windows for
Workgroups, the values for this setting must include the LANA numbers
for the real-mode protocols and NetBIOS's that you want to use. If
you do not start the network before starting Windows for Workgroups,
make sure that the values for this setting do not include LANA
numbers for protected-mode protocols or NetBIOS's.
____________________________________________________________
VirtualHDIrq=&lt;on-or-off&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:     On for AT-compatible computers; Off for all other computers
Purpose:     If enabled, Windows for Workgroups can terminate
</PRE>interrupts from the hard disk controller, bypassing the ROM routine
that handles these interrupts. Some hard-disk drives might require
this setting to be disabled in order for interrupts to be processed
correctly. If this setting is disabled, the ROM routine handles the
interrupts, which slows system performance.
