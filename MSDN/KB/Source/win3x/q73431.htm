The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows Setup program may return you to an MS-DOS prompt or stop
responding (hang) immediately after the Windows directory has been
specified.
<P>
This problem occurs before the System Information screen appears in
Windows Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This may be caused by installing Windows to a hard drive with an
excessive number of lost clusters. In such a situation, when the Setup
program tries to create the Windows directory, it fails.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use the steps below to troubleshoot the problem.
<P>
CAUTION: The following troubleshooting steps advise the use of the
MS-DOS utility CHKDSK with the /F parameter. Running CHKDSK/F on a hard
drive with a large number of lost clusters may result in damaged files,
loss of data, and the loss of directory integrity.  For more information
regarding CHKDSK, please read the "Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and
User's Reference" (pages 44-45 for version 4.01 and pages 381-383 for
version 5.0).
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting Steps</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Read the entire procedure before beginning, then either do steps
1-5 or skip steps 1-2 and begin with step 1b.

<OL><P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      chkdsk/f
</PRE><P>
   If the CHKDSK reveals lost clusters, convert those lost clusters to
   files by typing Y when prompted to do so.

<P><LI>Delete all files with the CHK extension in the root directory by
   typing:
<P>
<P><PRE>      del *.chk
</PRE><P>
   -or-
<P>
</OL>1b. At the MS-DOS prompt, type:
<P>
<PRE>      chkdsk/f

   If the CHKDSK utility reveals lost clusters, and you type N, MS-DOS
   corrects the disk, but does not save the contents of the lost
   allocation units.

   NOTE: If the number of lost clusters is excessive, there may be a
   hardware problem. It is difficult to provide a specific definition
   for excessive because some situations are more likely to produce
   lost clusters than others. For instance, it is far more likely that
   there would be lost clusters on a machine running software that
   creates large temporary files because an improper exit from such a
   program can result in many lost clusters. In any event, running
   CHKDSK/F in such a situation may result in the loss of data. When
   the CHKDSK reveals anything more than 100-200K of lost clusters,
   you may want to contact your service technician to have your
   hardware checked.

</PRE><P><LI>After following steps 1-2 or step 1b above, continue with step 3.
<P>
   If CHKDSK/F reveals no lost clusters, try to create a directory
   named WINDOWS by typing:
<P>
<P><PRE>      md windows
</PRE>
<P><LI>If the command is not successful (and you are not able to create
   the directory from MS-DOS), there may be a hardware problem. Contact
   your service technician.

<P><LI>If the command is successful, try running the Windows Setup program
   with the Windows directory already on the hard drive.
<P>
</OL>If these steps are not successful, query on the word "tshoot" (without
the quotation marks) to find more troubleshooting steps to resolve an
improper installation of Windows.
