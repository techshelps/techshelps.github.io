The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information about modifying Windows for Workgroups
version 3.1 for use with Artisoft's LANtastic network operating system.
If the following procedures do not allow connectivity between Windows
for Workgroups and LANtastic, call Artisoft Technical Support at (602)
670-7000.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft does not ensure the stability of Windows for Workgroups when
running with Artisoft's LANtastic.
<P>
Artisoft has provided the following modifications so that you can use
components of Windows for Workgroups with MS-DOS-based LANtastic
versions 4.x and with LANtastic for Windows.
<P>
NOTE: If you make the following changes according to Artisoft's
specifications, the Windows for Workgroups peer-to-peer and networking
capabilities are disabled.
<P>
LANtastic provides its own networking functionality as if it were
running with Windows 3.1, with added support for Mail and Schedule+.
For the MS-DOS based versions of LANtastic to use any Windows for
Workgroups components, a file called LANTNET.DRV is required. This
file may be obtained from Artisoft's bulletin board service (BBS) at
(602) 293-0065.
<P>
Windows for Workgroups can use all Artisoft's "AE" boards when the
cards are set for the NE2000 mode. Additionally, the Intel
EtherExpress 16-bit network interface card that ships with Windows for
Workgroups is compatible with LANtastic/AI cards. It requires the
driver EXP16LAN.EXE, which is available by calling Intel's BBS at
(503) 645-6275. If you loaded Windows for Workgroups using the Intel
EtherExpress adapter card, the low-level drivers from the CONFIG.SYS
file must be removed. The current network card compatibility list on
Artisoft's BBS should be checked for further information on other
types of compatible adapters.
<P>
With a normal installation of Windows for Workgroups, a LANtastic
network does not function at all. Windows for Workgroups has its own
redirector (REDIR), server functions, and low-level drivers (which are
incompatible with the LANtastic system).
<P>
<P><h3>Required Changes to SYSTEM.INI</h3>
 
<P>
To replace a Windows for Workgroups network with a LANtastic network,
make the following changes to the SYSTEM.INI file.

<OL><P><LI>In the [Boot] section, change
<P>
<P><PRE>      network=wfwnet.drv
</PRE><P>
   to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      network.drv=lantnet.drv
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the [386Enh] section, change
<P>
<P><PRE>      NetHeapSize=20
</PRE><P>
   to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NetHeapSize=64
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the following lines to the [386Enh] section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NetAsynchFallback=TRUE
      NetAsynchTimout=5.0
      PerVMFiles=0
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the following lines to the [LANtastic] section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Network_IRQ=xx
</PRE><P>
   where xx is the appropriate IRQ setting for your machine.
<P>
</OL><h3>Resulting Functionality</h3>
 
<P>
After you make these changes, normal LANtastic networking
functionality is available, with the following additions:
<P>
<PRE>   Mail
   Schedule+
   Network File Manager
   ClipBook Viewer

</PRE></OL>NOTE: The ClipBook Viewer cannot share files across the network, but
it does work locally.
<P>
The LANtastic for Windows dynamic data exchange (DDE) features
function; however, the following Windows for Workgroups network DDE
programs do not work:
<P>
<PRE>   Chat
   Hearts
   VSERVER.386
   NetWatcher
   WinMeter

</PRE><h3>Questions</h3>
 
<P>
Any questions concerning the conversion of Windows for Workgroups
network should be directed to Artisoft Technical Support.
<P>
LANtastic and LANtastic for Windows are manufactured by Artisoft, a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
