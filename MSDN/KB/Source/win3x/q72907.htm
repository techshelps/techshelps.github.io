</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows 3.0 Program Manager features a dynamic data exchange
(DDE) interface that allows other applications that support DDE (for
example, Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word for Windows) to control certain
aspects of Program Manager.
<P>
This can be done using any of the following commands:
<P>
<PRE>CreateGroup()   Instructs the Program Manager to create a
                new group or activate the window of an
                existing group.

ShowGroup()     Instructs the Program Manager to maximize,
                minimize, or restore a group window.

AddItem()       Instructs the Program Manager to create a
                new program item (icon) in the currently
                active group window.

DeleteGroup()   Instructs the Program Manager to delete
                a group.


ExitProgman()   Instructs the Program Manager to close.
                This command is only available when Program
                Manager is NOT the current Windows shell.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The section below describes each command in detail.
<P>
<P><h3>CreateGroup()</h3>
 
<P>
The following is the syntax for the CreateGroup() command:
<P>
<PRE>   CreateGroup(GroupName,GroupPath)

</PRE>GroupName is a string that names the group to be created. If a group
already exists, with the name specified by GroupName, the group window
will be activated.
<P>
GroupPath is a string that contains the path to the group file. If
this parameter is omitted, Windows will use a default filename for the
group in the Windows directory. This parameter is optional.
<P>
<P><h3>ShowGroup()</h3>
 
<P>
The following is the syntax for the ShowGroup() command:
<P>
<PRE>   ShowGroup(GroupName,ShowCommand).

</PRE>GroupName is a string that names the group window to be altered.
<P>
ShowCommand is an integer that specifies the action to be taken, based
on the following list:
<P>
<PRE>   Value                    Meaning
   -----                    -------

   1                        Activates and displays the group
                            window, or restores the group window
                            if the group is currently iconic or
                            maximized.

   2                        Activates the group window and
                            displays it as iconic.

   3                        Activates the group window and
                            displays it as maximized.

   4                        Restores the group window in its
                            most recent size and position and
                            activates it (similar to Value 1).

   5                        Activates the group window in its
                            current size and position.

   6                        Minimizes the group window.

   7                        Displays the group window as
                            iconic. The window that is
                            currently active remains active.

   8                        Displays the group window in its
                            current state. The window that is
                            currently active remains active.

</PRE><h3>AddItem()</h3>
 
<P>
The following is the syntax for the AddItem() command:
<P>
<PRE>   AddItem(CommandLine,Name,IconPath,IconIndex,xPos,yPos)

</PRE>CommandLine is a string that contains the full command line required
to execute the application. At a minimum, this is the name of the
application's executable file. It can also be the full pathname of the
application and any parameters required by the application.
<P>
Name is a string that supplies the title displayed below the icon in
the group window. This parameter is optional.
<P>
IconPath is a string that contains the name of the file containing the
icon to be displayed in the group window. This can be either a Windows
executable file or an .ICO (icon resource) file. If you do not supply
IconPath, Program Manager uses the first icon in the file specified by
CommandLine. If that file does not contain an icon, then Program
Manager uses a default icon (DOS icon). This parameter is optional.
<P>
IconIndex is an integer that specifies the index of the icon in the
IconPath file that Program Manager is supposed to display. PROGMAN.EXE
(Program Manager) contains five built-in icons that you can use for
Windows or non-Windows programs. This parameter is optional.
<P>
xPos &amp; yPos are integers that specify the horizontal and vertical
position of the icon within the group. You must use both parameters to
specify the icon's position. If you do not specify the position,
Program Manager places the icon in the next available space. These
parameters are optional.
<P>
<P><h3>DeleteGroup()</h3>
 
<P>
The following is the syntax for the DeleteGroup() command:
<P>
<PRE>   DeleteGroup(GroupName)

</PRE>GroupName is a string that names the group to be deleted.
<P>
<P><h3>ExitProgman()</h3>
 
<P>
The following is the syntax for the ExitProgman() command:
<P>
<PRE>   ExitProgman(bSaveState)

</PRE>bSaveState is a boolean value that, if TRUE, instructs Program Manager
to save its state before closing. If bSaveState is FALSE, Program
Manager does not save its state.
