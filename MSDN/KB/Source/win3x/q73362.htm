The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Two different Epson printers using the same driver (either 24 pin or 9
pin) cannot be set up concurrently in the Windows 3.0 Printers dialog
box, even if different ports are chosen for each driver.
<P>
The printer information that was chosen last is saved for both printer
entries.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
(The following assumes there are no existing printer drivers installed
on LPT1 or LPT2.)

<OL><P><LI>From the Main Group, select Printers from the Control Panel,
    choose Add Printers, select the Epson LQ-2500/2550 [Epson 24 pin]
    driver, and choose install.

<P><LI>When the driver is loaded from either the Windows 3.0 Disk 5 (5.25
    inch) or Disk 7 (3.5 inch) and it appears in the Installed Printers
    list, choose Configure and configure this driver for LPT1.

<P><LI>Choose Setup, select LQ 2500/2550 from the printer list, and
    choose OK twice.

<P><LI>From the printers screen, choose Active from the Status box.

<P><LI>Select the Epson LQ 850/950/1050 [Epson 24 pin] from the printer
    list and choose Install.

<P><LI>You will get the following message:
<P>
       A printer driver for this printer is
       already on the system.  Do you
       want to use the current driver or
       install a new driver?
<P>
<PRE>       CURRENT    NEW   CANCEL

</PRE><P><LI>Choose Current.

<P><LI>When this second driver appears, choose Configure and configure the
    driver for LPT2.

<P><LI>Choose Setup, select LQ 850/950/1050 from the printer list,
    and choose OK twice.

<P><LI>From the Printers dialog box, choose Active from the Status box.
<P>
   You now have two Epson 24-pin printer drivers configured: one on
   LPT1 set to LQ-2500/2550 and one on LPT2 set to LQ-850/950/1050 in
   the Control Panel. Both are active.

<P><LI>Choose OK to return to the Control Panel and exit to Program
    Manager.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Exit.

<P><LI>At the C prompt, type "win" (without the quotation marks) to
    return to Windows.

<P><LI>Open the Control Panel and select Printers.

<P><LI>Select the Epson 24-pin driver on LPT1.

<P><LI>Choose Configure and Setup, and note that the driver has changed to
    LQ-850/950/1050.

<P><LI>Choose OK twice and select the Epson 24-pin driver on LPT2. Choose
    Configure and Setup, and note that the driver has stayed
    LQ-850/950/1050, as set up last.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The steps are somewhat different to set the two drivers up as
outlined if you choose New at step 6, but the results are the same.
