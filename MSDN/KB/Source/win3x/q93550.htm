<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you run an MS-DOS application from Windows version 3.1, the system may
hang if Windows tries to play a Wave audio file (*.WAV) through the Pro
Audio Spectrum 16 audio card. This happens if a Windows application running
in the background attempts to play a Wave audio file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you use Pro Audio Spectrum Windows 3.1 driver
versions earlier than 1.42. Versions 1.42 and later correct this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Pro Audio Spectrum 16 has the ability to have separate DMA and IRQ
settings for Windows and MS-DOS. The default settings for both MS-DOS and
Windows are DMA 3 and IRQ 7. Having different DMA and IRQ settings allows
Windows 3.1 applications to be configured for maximum performance since DMA
channels 5, 6, and 7 are 16-bit channels. Most MS-DOS applications cannot
access DMA channels 5, 6, or 7 and thus typically use channels 1 or 3,
which are only 8-bit channels. For this reason, it is beneficial to have
separate DMA and IRQ settings for Windows and MS-DOS.
<P>
According to Media Vision Technical Support, the Pro Audio Spectrum 16 must
reset itself when switching from Windows to MS-DOS or from MS-DOS to
Windows. Even if the DMA and IRQ settings are set the same for both Windows
and MS-DOS, the Spectrum 16 must still reset itself when switching
environments.
<P>
For this reason, Windows 3.1 may hang if a Windows application tries to
play a Wave audio file while an MS-DOS application is running. Since the
Spectrum 16 is reset when switching from Windows to MS-DOS, Windows will be
unable to play the Wave audio file. Upon exiting the MS-DOS application,
Windows attempts to play the buffered Wave audio file. If the Wave audio
file is more than a few seconds long, Windows may hang. Products, such as
Microsoft SoundBits, that add the playing of Wave audio files to certain
events in Windows (such as, the closing of an application) should function
fine because of the relative short length of the their Wave audio files.
Even with SoundBits, exiting an MS-DOS application in Windows will produce
audible distortion in the Wave audio file as the Spectrum 16 is resetting
itself.
<P>
Setting the DMABufferSize line in the [386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI
file to a number higher than the default of 16 may help the problem, but
may not totally eliminate it.
<P>
Example:
<P>
<PRE>   DMABufferSize=64
