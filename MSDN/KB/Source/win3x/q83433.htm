<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information contained in this article is contained in the WININI.WRI
file in the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit for the Microsoft Windows
operating system version 3.1. The WININI.WRI file may be viewed within the
Windows Write utility in the Windows Accessories Group.
<P>
The WININI.WRI file contains specific information about the entries.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>WIN.INI File Settings</h3>
 
<P>
Windows initialization files contain information that defines your
Windows environment. Windows and Windows applications can use the
information stored in these files to configure themselves to meet your
needs and preferences.
<P>
There are two standard Windows initialization files:

<OL><P><LI>WIN.INI, which primarily contains settings that you can use to
   customize your Windows environment according to your preferences.

<P><LI>SYSTEM.INI, which primarily contains settings that you can use to
   customize Windows to meet your system's hardware needs.
<P>
</OL>Caution: Changing settings can lead to undesirable results when you
run Windows. Before changing any setting, read "Changing Settings"
later in this document.
<P>
<P><h3>Format of the WIN.INI File</h3>
 
<P>
The WIN.INI file contains several sections, each of which consists of
a group of related settings. The sections and settings are listed in
the WIN.INI file in the following format:
<P>
<PRE>  [section name]
  keyname=value

</PRE></OL>In this example, [section name] is the name of a section. The
enclosing brackets ([]) are required, and the left bracket must be in
the leftmost column on the screen.
<P>
The keyname=value statement defines the value of each setting. A
keyname is the name of a setting. It can consist of any combination of
letters and digits, and must be followed immediately by an equal sign
(=). The value can be an integer, a string, or a quoted string,
depending on the setting.
<P>
You can include comments in initialization files. You must begin each
line of  a comment with a semicolon (;).
<P>
<P><h3>Sections in the WIN.INI File</h3>
 
<P>
The sections described in the list below most often appear in the
WIN.INI file. Your WIN.INI file might not have all of these sections,
or it might have additional sections, depending on your system's
hardware and software requirements and configuration. For example, if
you install a printer or set up applications, additional sections and
settings might be inserted by your applications or the software that
controls your printer. Refer to your application's documentation for
information on those sections and settings.
<P>
The following sections appear in WIN.INI and in this document in the
following order (however, the order of these sections is not
important):
<P>

</PRE><h3>Updating WIN.INI from Previous Versions of Windows</h3>
 
<P>
If you update your system to Windows version 3.1 from Windows version
3.0, Setup automatically updates your WIN.INI file by making the
following changes:
<P>
In the [windows] section, Setup adds three new settings:
<P>
KeyboardDelay=
ScreenSaverTimeout=
DosPrint=
<P>
If the following settings are already present in the 3.0 version of
the WIN.INI file, Setup will not change them. If they are not present,
Setup will add them:
<P>
Device=
Documents=
Programs=com exe bat pif
<P>
In the [extensions] section, Setup adds one new setting:
<P>
bmp=pbrush.exe ^.bmp
<P>
Setup adds two new settings, if they are not already present in the
3.0 version of the WIN.INI file:
<P>
pcx=pbrush.exe ^.pcx
rec=recorder.exe ^.rec
<P>
In the [ports] section, Setup adds:
<P>
LPT1.DOS
LPT2.DOS
<P>
Setup adds three additional settings, if they are not already present
in the 3.0 version of WIN.INI:
<P>
FILE:
COM3:=9600,n,8,1,x
COM4:=9600,n,8,1,x
<P>
Setup adds the following section and settings to support TrueType
fonts:
<P>
[FontSubstitutes]
Helv=MS Sans Serif

Times=Times New Roman
Helvetica=Arial
<P>
Setup adds the following sections and settings to support multimedia:
<P>
[mci extensions]
wav=waveaudio
mid=sequencer
rmi=sequencer
<P>
Setup adds the following sections and settings to support sound:
<P>
[sounds]
SystemDefault=ding.wav, Default Beep
SystemExclamation=chord.wav, Exclamation
SystemStart=tada.wav, Windows Start
SystemExit=chimes.wav, Windows Exit
SystemHand=chord.wav, Critical Stop
SystemQuestion=chord.wav, Question
SystemAsterisk=chord.wav, Asterisk
<P>
Setup adds the following section and settings to support OLE:
<P>
[embedding]
SoundRec=Sound,Sound,SoundRec.exe,picture
Package=Package,Package,packager.exe,picture
PBrush=Paintbrush Picture,Paintbrush Picture,pbrush.exe,picture
<P>
Setup also makes additional changed, depending on the applications and
devices installed on your system.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Read this Document</h3>
 
<P>
In this document, WIN.INI settings are listed alphabetically within
sections. However, the settings do not appear alphabetically in the
WIN.INI file. If you want to change a setting, you will have to search
for it within the appropriate section.
<P>
This document lists the syntax, purpose, and recommended method for
changing each setting using the following format:
<P>
SettingName=&lt;value-type&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        This is Windows' built-in value for this setting.
Purpose:        This paragraph briefly describes the function of the
</PRE>setting
<PRE>                and its default value (if applicable).
To change:      This sentence states the recommended method for changing
                the value of this setting.

</PRE>The &lt;value-type&gt; indicates whether the value should be a number, a
letter, a range of numbers, or something else.
<P>
<P><h3>Changing Settings</h3>
 
<P>
When the Setup program created the WIN.INI, file it assigned default
values to the settings. Some settings that are listed in this
document, may not appear in your WIN.INI file. These settings have the
default value. You might want to change one or more of these values to
change the appearance or performance of Windows to suit your needs.
<P>
Caution:  Always back up your WIN.INI file before you make changes so
that you can restore the original file in cause you accidently damage
the WIN.INI file or make changes that cause problems when running
Windows.
<P>
There are two ways to change WIN.INI settings:
<P>
By using Control Panel to change most settings. This is the safest
and most recommended way because there is no need to open the
WIN.INI file, where it is easier to make mistakes. For more
information on Control Panel, see Chapter 5, "Control Panel," in the
Windows User's Guide.
<P>
By using a text editor, such as Notepad, to edit the WIN.INI file
directly. (Don't use a formatting editor; it can corrupt your
WIN.INI file.) This is the method you must use to change the
settings that cannot be changed with Control Panel. After you have
edited the WIN.INI file, you must restart Windows for the settings
to take affect. For more information on how to use Notepad, see
Chapter 12, "Additional Accessories," in the Windows User's Guide.
<P>
Caution:  Be extra careful when using a text editor to edit the
WIN.INI file. Incorrect changes to WIN.INI can cause unexpected
results when you run Windows. In addition, some editors can damage
certain characters  (those with ANSI values of greater than 127). It
is recommended that you use Notepad to change the settings that cannot
be changed with Control Panel. The listings in this document indicate
which settings you can change with Control Panel.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>[windows] Section Settings</h3>
 
<P>
The [windows] section contains settings that affect the following
parts of your Windows environment:
<P>
<PRE>  Applications that start when you start Windows
  Warning beep
  Printing
  Window border width
  Keyboard speed
  Mouse settings
  Definition of files as documents or programs

</PRE>The [windows] section can contain the following settings:
<P>
Beep=&lt;yes-or-no&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        Yes
Purpose:        If this setting is enabled, Windows sounds a warning
                beep when you  attempt to do something that is not
                allowed.
To change:      Choose the Sound icon from the Control Panel window.

</PRE>BorderWidth=&lt;number&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        3
Purpose:        Sets the width of the borders around all the windows on
                your desktop except those that have a fixed size. The
                allowed range is 1 (narrowest) to 49 (widest).
To change:      Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel window.

</PRE>CoolSwitch=&lt;0-or-1&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        1
Purpose:        Turns fast task switching on or off. A value of 1 turns
                this feature on. A value of 0 turns it off.
To change:      Choose the Desktop icon in the Control Panel window and
                select or clear the Fast "Alt+TAB" Switching check box.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
CursorBlinkRate=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        530
Purpose:        Indicates how many milliseconds elapse between each blink
of
                the selection cursor.
To change:      Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel window.
</PRE>_____________________________________________________________
Device=&lt;output-device-name&gt;, &lt;device-driver&gt;, &lt;port-connection&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        None
Purpose:        Defines the default printer. The &lt;output-device-name&gt; value
                can be any device name given in the [devices] section. An
                explicit port and driver must be assigned to the device.
The
                &lt;device-driver&gt; value is the filename (without the
</PRE>extension)
<PRE>                of the device-driver file. The &lt;port-connection&gt; value is
any
                portname given in the [ports] section.
To change:      Choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel window or
                the Printer Setup command from the Print Manager Options
                menu.
</PRE>_____________________________________________________________
DefaultQueueSize=&lt;number&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        8
Purpose:        Specifies the number of messages an application's message
                queue can hold.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file. (You should never
                need to change this setting.)
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
DeviceNotSelectedTimeout=&lt;seconds&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        15
Purpose:        Specifies the default number of seconds for Windows to wait
                for a device to be switched on. A value is saved for each
                printer listed in the [PrinterPorts] section. If the device
                is not turned on during this time, Windows won't print to
the
                device. Note that for some devices, Windows immediately
                displays an error message if the device is not already
</PRE>turned
<PRE>                on.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file. This setting serves
                only as the system default value. To change the value for a
                particular printer, choose the Printers icon from the
</PRE>Control
<PRE>                Panel window or the Printer Setup command from the Print
                Manager Options menu. This changes the corresponding value
                only in the [PrinterPorts] section.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
Documents=&lt;extensions&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        None
Purpose:        Defines files that are considered "documents" by Windows
                File Manager. The listings in the [extensions] section also
                determine which files File Manager recognizes as document
                files, and associates them with a particular application.
The
                extensions listed here are not associated with any
                application. Use this setting to define only document file
                extensions that are not in the [extensions] section.
</PRE>Separate
<PRE>                extension names with a space, and do not include the
                preceding periods.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
DosPrint=&lt;yes-or-no&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        No
Purpose:        Specifies whether Windows should use MS-DOS interrupts
                when printing. When this setting is yes, MS-DOS interrupts
                are used. When this setting is no, printing output is sent
                directly to the port that the printer is assigned to.
To change:      Choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel window or
                the Printer Setup command from the Print Manager Options
                menu, and then clear the Fast Printing Direct to Port check
                box in the Connect dialog box.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
DoubleClickHeight=&lt;pixels&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        4
Purpose:        Specifies the height (in pixels) that the mouse pointer can
                move between clicks in a double-click. If the mouse pointer
                is moved further up or down,  the two clicks will be
</PRE>treated
<PRE>                as separate single clicks. For example, if
                DoubleClickHeight=10, the mouse pointer cannot move
                vertically more than 5 pixels between clicks for the two
                clicks to be recognized as a double-click. If you enter an
                odd number, it is rounded up to the nearest even number.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
DoubleClickSpeed=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        452
Purpose:        Establishes the maximum amount of time between clicks of
                the mouse button that the system will permit for one double-
                click. The lower the value, the less time you have to click
                twice in order to effect a double-click.
To change:      Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel window.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
DoubleClickWidth=&lt;pixels&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        4
Purpose:        Specifies the width (in pixels) that the mouse pointer can
                move between clicks in a double-click. If the mouse pointer
                is moved further right or left, the two clicks will be
                treated as separate single clicks. For example, if
                DoubleClickWIDTH=10, the mouse pointer cannot move
                horizontally more than 5 pixels between clicks for the two
                clicks to be recognized as a double-click. If you enter an
                odd number, it is rounded up to the nearest even number.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
KeyboardDelay=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        2
Purpose:        Establishes how much time elapses after you hold down a key
                before the key starts to repeat.
To change:      Choose the Keyboard icon from the Control Panel window.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
KeyboardSpeed=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        31
Purpose:        Establishes how much time elapses between repetitions of a
                character on the display when you hold down a keyboard key.
                This setting does not  work for all keyboards. If you
</PRE>delete
<PRE>                this setting from WIN.INI, Windows Setup will not set this
                speed, but the speed will still be set if you choose the
                Keyboard icon in Control Panel (even if you cancel out of
                it).
To change:      Choose the Keyboard icon from the Control Panel window.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
Load=&lt;filename(s)&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        none
Purpose:        Specifies one or more applications that will run as icons
                when Windows is started. This value is a list of one or
more
                program filenames for applications, or documents that are
                associated with an application, each separated by a space.
                Make sure you specify the complete path if the application
or
                document is not located in the Windows directory.
To change:      Add the application to the Startup group in Program
                Manager and then, select the Minimize on Use check box in
the
                Properties dialog box.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
MenuDropAlignment=&lt;0-or-1&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        0
Purpose:        Specifies whether menus open so that they are right aligned
                or left aligned with the menu title. If this setting is 0,
                menus open so that they are left aligned. If it is 1, menus
                open so that they are right aligned.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
MenuShowDelay=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        0 for 386 computers; 400 for 286 computers
Purpose:        Specifies how long to wait before displaying a cascading
                menu.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
MouseSpeed=&lt;0-or-1-or-2&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        1
Purpose:        Establishes the relationship between mouse movement and
                cursor movement when the value of either MouseThreshold1 or
                MouseThreshold2 is exceeded. When this occurs, Windows
</PRE>causes
<PRE>                cursor movement to accelerate according to the value of
                MouseSpeed. If it is 0,  there is no acceleration. If it is
                1, the cursor is moved twice the normal speed when mouse
                movement exceeds the value of MouseThreshold1. If  it is 2,
                the cursor is moved twice the normal speed when mouse
                movement exceeds the value of MouseThreshold1 or four times
                the normal speed if mouse movement exceeds MouseThreshold2.
To change:      Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel window.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
MouseThreshold1=&lt;pixels&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        5
Purpose:        Establishes the maximum number of pixels that the mouse can
                move between mouse interrupts before Windows alters the
                relationship between mouse movement and cursor movement. If
                the mouse movement exceeds this threshold and MouseSpeed is
                greater than zero, Windows moves the cursor at twice the
                normal speed.
To change:      Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel window.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
MouseThreshold2=&lt;pixels&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        10
Purpose:        Establishes the maximum number of pixels that the mouse can
                move between mouse interrupts before Windows alters the
                relationship between mouse movement and cursor movement. If
                the mouse movement exceeds this threshold and MouseSpeed is

</PRE>specified).
<PRE>Purpose:        Specifies a pattern that is used to paint the screen
                background. The eight numeric values define a bitmap eight
                pixels wide and eight pixels high. Each decimal value
                represents a byte, and each byte represents a row of eight
                pixels. The following shows the effect of setting a bit:

   Setting      Effect
   0            Sets the corresponding pixel to the
                background color specified by the Background
                setting in the [colors] section).

   1            Sets the corresponding pixel to the foreground

<P>
[extensions] Section Settings
<P>
The [extensions] section contains settings that link groups of
document files with an application so that opening one of the document
files automatically starts the application.
<P>
The [extensions] section can contain settings of the following type:
____________________________________________________________
&lt;extension&gt;=&lt;command-line&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Purpose:        Contains a list of filename extensions that identify
                documents, and corresponding command lines that are invoked
                when you choose a file that has  the associated extensions.

                The &lt;extension&gt; keyname is an extension of one to three
                characters. The &lt;command-line&gt; value is an ordinary DOS
                command line. The command line always begins with an
                application filename (with the .EXE extension). This can be
                followed by any command parameters the application needs,
                usually including the document filename. The caret (^)
                character can be used when the original document filename
is
                needed in the command line; the caret is replaced by the
                document filename without any extension. The most typical
                &lt;extension&gt; entries list the application name and the
                document name; for example:

                cal=calendar.exe ^.cal

                If you run a file called MYFILE.CAL after this association
                has been made, the Calendar progam will start and
                automatically open the file named MYFILE.

To change:      Choose Associate from the File menu in File Manager.

<P>
[ports] Section
<P>
The [ports] section lists all available communications and printer
ports, and defines default values; it also lists files to which
printer output can be sent.
<P>
The [ports] section can contain up to 10 occurrences of the following
setting. Any additional occurrences are ignored by Windows.
____________________________________________________________
&lt;portname&gt;:=&lt;baud-rate&gt;,&lt;parity&gt;,&lt;word-length&gt;,&lt;stop-bits&gt;[[,p]]
<P>
<PRE>Purpose:        Specifies an available output port. You can specify no more
                than 10 ports.

                The &lt;portname&gt; keyname must be the name of an output port
as
                it is recognized by MS-DOS. This keyname can be COMx:
</PRE>(serial
<PRE>                port, where x represents the port number), LPTx: (a
</PRE>parallel
<PRE>                port, where x represents the port number), EPT: (used for a
                specific IBM printer), LPTx.DOS (a parallel port used to
                bypass Windows printing and print directly to a port, where
x
                represents the port number), FILE:, or a filename.

                For COM ports, the &lt;baud-rate&gt; value specifies the port's
                baud rate; the &lt;word-length&gt; value gives the length of a
word
                (in bits); the &lt;stop-bits&gt; value gives the number of stop
                bits to be used; and the [[,p]] option specifies that
                hardware handshaking is in effect.

                LPT (parallel), EPT, FILE, and LPTx.DOSports do not take
any
                parameters.

                The LPTx.DOS ports are used (instead of the corresponding
LPT
                port) to print directly to the port and bypass the Windows'
                special output handling. This port is provides compatiblity
                with Windows version 3.0.

                Specifying a filename for the &lt;portname&gt; will direct output
                to that file. A filename, unlike the other port names, must
                not be followed by a colon (:).

                By using FILE:=, Windows will prompt you to specify a
                filename for the print file when you print.

</PRE>To change COM port settings: Choose the Ports icon from the Control Panel
<PRE>                window. To change or add other ports:  Use Notepad to edit
                the WIN.INI file.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
LPT1.DOS=&lt;pathname&gt;
LPT2.DOS=&lt;pathname&gt;
LPT3.DOS=&lt;pathname&gt;
LPT4.DOS=&lt;pathname&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        None
Purpose:        Enables printing directly to a parallel port. Use these
                settings to bypass Windows' special parallel port output
                handling when printing.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.

<P>
The [FontSubstitutes] section contains one or more occurrences of the
following setting:
____________________________________________________________
&lt;font-name&gt;=&lt;font-name&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        Helv=MS Sans Serif
                Tms Rmn=MS Serif
                Times=Times New Roman
                Helvetica=Arial
Purpose:        Specifies the font that Windows will use in place of
                another font, only if that font is not installed on your
                system. For example, if you are viewing a document that is
                formatted in Helvetica, but Helvetica is not installed on
                your system, Windows will use Arial to display the
</PRE>document.
<PRE>To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.

<P>
[TrueType] Section Settings
<P>
The [TrueType] section describes options that affect the use and
display of TrueType fonts in your Windows applications.
<P>
The [TrueType] section can contain the following settings:
____________________________________________________________
OutlineThreshold=&lt;number-of-pels-per-em&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        256
Purpose:        Specifies the number of pels-per-em at which Windows will
                render TrueType fonts as outline fonts instead of as bitmap
                fonts. Using bitmap fonts is faster, but requires more
                memory. If you are low on memory, decrease this value. Do
not
                specify a value over 300. If you do, you might encounter
                problems using  TrueType fonts.
 To change:     Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
TTEnable=&lt;0-or-1&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        1
Purpose:        Enables or disables TrueType fonts. Setting this value to 1
                enables TrueType fonts so that they are available in your
                Windows applications. Setting this value to 0 disables
                TrueType fonts. In this case, TrueType fonts are not
                available in your applications.
To change:      Choose the Fonts icon from the Control Panel window.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
TTIfCollisions=&lt;0-or-1&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        0
Purpose:        Specifies whether or not to use TrueType fonts in place of
                other fonts if both types of fonts are installed on your
                system and have the same font name. If this value is set to
                1, the TrueType font will be used. For example, Windows
                provides both a bitmap and a TrueType version of the Symbol
                font. If you set this value to 0, Windows will use the
                TrueType version.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
</PRE>____________________________________________________________
TTOnly=&lt;0-or-1&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Default:        0
Purpose:        Specifies whether or not to list only TrueType fonts in the
                fonts dialog box in Windows applications. If this value is
                set to 1, only TrueType fonts are listed. If this value is

<P>
The [Windows Help] section can include the following settings:
____________________________________________________________
M_WindowPosition=&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;, &lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;
H_WindowPosition=&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;, &lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;
A_WindowPosition=&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;, &lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;
C_WindowPosition=&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;, &lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;
<P>
<PRE>Purpose:        Defines the default size and position of the main Help
                window, and the History, Annotate, and Copy dialog boxes.

                The first &lt;number&gt; defines the x coordinate of the upper-
left
                corner. The second &lt;number&gt; defines the y coordinate of the
                upper-left corner. Both these numbers define the default
                position of the main Help window, and the History,
</PRE>Annotate,
<PRE>                and Copy dialog boxes.

                The third &lt;number&gt; defines the default width of the Help
                window and dialog boxes. The fourth &lt;number&gt; defines the
                default height of the Help window and dialog boxes. Both
                height and width are measured in pixels.

                The fifth &lt;number&gt; specifies whether or not the main Help
                window is maximized. A value of 1 indicates that it is
                maximized. A value of 0 indicates that the main window is
the
                default height and width. Changing this value has no effect
                on the size of the dialog boxes, since they cannot be
                maximized.

To change:      Move or size the main Help window, or the History,
                Annotate, or Copy dialog boxes. The values are updated in
the
                WIN.IN file automatically.

&lt;DeviceNotSelectedTimeout&gt;,&lt;TransmissionRetryTimeout&gt;
[[,&lt;port-name&gt;,&lt;DeviceNotSelectedTimeout&gt;,
&lt;TransmissionRetryTimeout&gt;,...]]
<P>
<PRE>Purpose:        Specifies driver, port, and timeout information for a
                printer.

                The &lt;device-name&gt; keyname is the name of the printer. The
                &lt;driver-name&gt;  value is the printer driver filename.

                The &lt;port-name&gt; value is the name of the port assigned to
the
                printer. If a printer is not assigned to a port the
                &lt;port-name&gt; value is the string specified in the NullPort
                setting (in the [windows] section).

                The &lt;TransmissionRetryTimeout&gt; value determines the amount
of
                time (in  seconds) allowed for attempted transmission
                retries.

                The &lt;DeviceNotSelectedTimeout&gt; value determines the number
of
                seconds Print Manager will wait for the device to be
</PRE>switched
<PRE>                on.

                If the timeout values are not specified for a particular
                port, Windows uses the default settings listed in the
                [windows] section for that port.

</PRE>Caution: When changing a setting in this section, be sure it does not
conflict with a corresponding setting in the [devices] section. Problems
may occur if an installed printer does not appear in the [PrinterPorts]
section.
<P>
<PRE>To change:      Choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel window or
                choose the Printer Setup command from the Print Manager
                Options menu.

<P>
<PRE>  Purpose:      Specifies an installed printer.

                The &lt;device-name&gt; keyname is the name of the printer. The
                &lt;driver-name&gt; value is the printer driver filename. The
                &lt;port-name&gt; value specifies the port that is assigned to
the
                printer. If the printer is not currently assigned to a
</PRE>port,
<PRE>                the &lt;port-name&gt; value is the string specified in the
</PRE>NullPort
<PRE>                setting (in the [windows] section).

</PRE>Caution: When changing a setting in this section, be sure it does not
conflict with a corresponding setting in the [PrinterPorts] section.
