<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the Novell NetWare shell NETX.COM by resets the local
workstation time to match that of the default (or preferred) server
when loaded. If that server is in a different time zone, or otherwise
has a different time-of-day (or date) than the local workstation, the
local workstation's system clock may be reset to match the server's
date and time.
<P>
This behavior can be avoided by placing the following command in the
workstation's SHELL.CFG file:
<P>
<PRE>   SET STATION TIME=OFF

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Novell NetWare redirector (shell) NETX.COM (or equivalent) must be
installed to allow connectivity to a Novell LAN. When NETX loads, it
attaches the workstation to a default server, or a preferred server as
specified by the user or network administrator.
<P>
When the server is attached, NETX.COM by default resets the local
workstation's date and time to match that of the server. If the server
resides in a different time zone, or maintains a different date or
time-of-day than that of the local workstation, the resetting of the
workstation clock may result in an incorrect date and/or time relative
to local time.
<P>
To override the resetting of the local workstation time, the above
line should be added to the SHELL.CFG file.
<P>
The SHELL.CFG file is an ASCII text file and may be created and/or
edited using any text editor, such as the MS-DOS 5.0 EDIT command, or
the Windows for Workgroups Notepad program. NETX.COM should then be
loaded in the following manner to read the configuration file:
<P>
<PRE>   NETX /C=[drive:][\path\]SHELL.CFG

</PRE>This instructs NETX to load and read the SHELL.CFG file from the drive
and directory specified for proper configuration information. If
SHELL.CFG is properly recognized, a verification appears that these
features are enabled when the NetWare shell loads.
<P>
For more information on other SHELL.CFG options, see the "NetWare
Supervisor Reference Guide." Note that some SHELL.CFG options are new
and will not be present in earlier versions of the NetWare
documentation.
<P>
