The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not been
tested and are not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Although Microsoft Windows for Workgroups is designed to provide peer-to-
peer networking functions (such as local file sharing and local printer
sharing), you may occasionally need to disable the ability to share local
resources, or you may need to disable network functionality completely.
<P>
NOTE: This article applies to version 3.1 of Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups. It does not apply to later versions of the product. Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11 allows you to do this during installation and
through Network Setup.
<P>
This article contains procedures to disable various features and
capabilities of Windows for Workgroups. You can re-enable a feature by
reversing the procedure.
<P>

<P><h3>To Disable Sharing Local Resources</h3>
 
<P>
To disable the ability to share local resources (both files and
printers), while maintaining the ability to connect to other network
servers, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Clear the Enable Sharing box in the Network Settings dialog box of
   Control Panel.

<P><LI>Use a text editor (such as Notepad) to add the following entry to
   the [network] section of the SYSTEM.INI file located in the Windows
   directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [network]
      NoSharingControl=1
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>To Disable Sharing Local Files</h3>
 
<P>
To disable the ability to share resources (files) from the File
Manager, use a text editor to modify the WINFILE.INI file in the
Windows directory, and add the following section heading and entry:
<P>
<PRE>   [restrictions]
   NoShareCommands=1

</PRE></OL><h3>To Disable Sharing Local Printers</h3>
 
<P>
To disable the ability to share local print resources from Print Manager,
use a text editor to modify the WIN.INI file in the Windows directory. Add
the following line to the [Spooler] section of the file:
<P>
<PRE>   NoShareCommands=1

</PRE><h3>To Disable All Network Functionality</h3>
 
<P>
To disable network functionality completely, including the ability to
share local resources, use a text editor to modify the [boot] section
of the SYSTEM.INI file located in the Windows directory. Change the
"network.drv=" entry from:
<P>
<PRE>   network.drv=wfwnet.drv

</PRE>to:
<P>
<PRE>   network.drv=

</PRE>NOTE: It is not possible to disable local printer sharing without also
disabling local file sharing.
