1. Q. When you are using Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, what
      are the system requirements for using File Manager or Print
      Manager to share resources?

   A. To share network resources using File Manager or Print Manager,
      you must have at least 3 megabytes (MB) of RAM on your machine
      and be operating in 386 enhanced mode. You can only share
      resources that are on your machine; you cannot share resources
      to which you are connected over the network.

2. Q. How can I share my local CD-ROM drive using Microsoft
      Windows for Workgroups?

   A. To share a CD-ROM drive using Windows for Workgroups, use the
      following five steps:

      1. Load the device-dependent CD-ROM driver in the CONFIG.SYS
         file. This driver can be obtained from your CD-ROM vendor.

      2. Load MSCDEX.EXE /S in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. MSCDEX.EXE
         must be version 2.21 and loaded with the /S switch to allow
         sharing capability. MSCDEX.EXE can be obtained from your CD-
         ROM vendor. If you are running Novell(R) NetWare(R) with
         Windows for Workgroups, MSCDEX must be loaded prior to MSIPX.

      3. After you make these modifications, save the files,
         restart the machine, then start Windows.

      4. The CD-ROM drive can be shared in the same way any other
         local hard disk drive can be shared. Choose the CD-ROM icon
         and select the directories to be shared.

      5. In File Manager, choose Share As from the Disk menu. In
         the Share Directory dialog box, type the Share Name
         information, any comments you want to use to describe the
         shared resource, and then set the Access Type and Password
         options.

      For more information on troubleshooting CD-ROM sharing issues,
      please refer to your Windows for Workgroups documentation.

3. Q. Are there differences between Windows for Workgroups Print
      Manager and Print Manager in Windows 3.1?

   A. Yes. Please note the following three differences in the Windows
      for Workgroups Print Manager:

      1. The user interfaces for both Print Manager and the
         Printers icon in Control Panel are different from those used
         in Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1. For
         example, you must disconnect printers from Print Manager
         only; you can no longer disconnect printers from Control
         Panel.

      2. The toolbar in Print Manager is a new feature. Unlike the
         toolbar in File Manager, the Print Manager toolbar cannot be
         customized.

      3. Print Manager cannot pause print jobs locally.

      For more information, please refer to your Windows for Workgroups
      documentation.
