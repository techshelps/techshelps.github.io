<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a Setup error message contains an error code, it also includes some
text indicating what Setup was trying to do, for example, copying a file.
The text of the error message  indicates whether the error is fatal or not.
In some non-fatal cases, Setup may be performing an operation (such as
copying a file) that is needed in order to run Windows. Other times the
error may prevent some specific feature of Windows from operating properly.
<P>
In many cases, the error code is an MS-DOS extended error code. These error
codes are between 0 and 100. Setup-specific error codes have two different
formats, depending on whether the error occurs during the character
(MS-DOS) mode or the Windows graphical user interface (GUI) mode portion of
Setup. The character mode Setup-specific error numbers are in the format
"Snnn", where "nnn" is any three digits. The GUI mode error numbers have
codes greater than 200.

S001
<P>
<PRE>   Could not open SETUP.INF. SETUP.INF should reside on the
   first Windows Setup disk for first-time installations or
   upgrades and should reside in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
   subdirectory when Setup is used to change the system
   configuration after Windows has been set up. If you are
   changing the configuration, make sure SETUP.INF does not
   exist in the WINDOWS directory and copy SETUP.INF from
   the first Windows Setup disk to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
   subdirectory and try again. If it is a first-time
   installation or upgrade, make sure to set the current
   drive and directory to the location of the Setup program
   and then run Setup from the
   MS-DOS prompt.

</PRE>S002
<P>
<PRE>   Could not load SETUP.INF. Usually due to lack of memory.
   May also be due to a corrupt SETUP.INF. Should not occur
   during a first-time installation or upgrade. After
   making sure that there is enough memory, follow the
   instructions for S001.

</PRE>S004

   user's system. Follow the instructions for S001.

</PRE>S018
<P>
<PRE>   Entry not found in SETUP.INF: [user] section corrupt.
   Setup has probably found an invalid SETUP.INF on the
   user's system. Follow the instructions for S001.

</PRE>S019
<P>
<PRE>   WIN.COM not created. This may be due to missing files, a
   bad SETUP.INF or OEMSETUP.INF, lack of disk space, or an
   inability to create or modify the WIN.COM file. When you
   first install Windows or change display drivers, Setup
   creates the file WIN.COM from the file WIN.CNF and
   displays the dependent logo files, usually named *.lgo
   and *.rle. The logo files are specified in the .INF file
   for the chosen display.

   Make sure you do not have virus-protection software that
   does not allow executables to be modified. Try changing
   the display after exiting Windows and running Setup from
   the MS-DOS prompt. If you are selecting an original
   equipment manufacturer (OEM) display, try one of the
   display drivers that are shipped with Windows 3.1 to see
   if the OEMSETUP.INF file is not valid or if it specifies
   files that do not exist. If selecting a supplied display
   driver does not work, make sure the SETUP.INF file is
   valid (see error S001 above).

</PRE>S020
<P>
<PRE>   SYSTEM.INI was not correctly updated. This will occur
   when attempting to configure Windows with a new device
   or for a new system software configuration. The main
   reason for this problem occurring is lack of memory or a
   corrupt SYSTEM.INI file. It is also possible to get this
   error because of a corrupt .INF file. Make sure there is
   enough memory and that the SYSTEM.INI file is of a
   reasonable size (not much more than 5K) and try the
   operation again. Try selecting a different component
   (for example, select No Network instead of the network
   selected or select VGA instead of the display that is
   selected). If this succeeds, copy the SYSTEM.INI file to
   a backup disk and try again. If not, the SYSTEM.INI or
   SETUP.INF file is probably corrupted.

</PRE>S021
<P>
<PRE>   SYSTEM.INI was not correctly updated. See S020 above.

</PRE>S022
<P>
<PRE>   Setup did not save its state in the SYSTEM.INI file.
   This is due to either insufficient memory or a corrupt
   SYSTEM.INI file.
