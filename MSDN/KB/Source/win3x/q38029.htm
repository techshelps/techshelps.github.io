The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 2.x, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1,
   3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive either of the following error messages when you start
Microsoft Windows in 386 enhanced mode:

<UL><LI>WARNING: The Intel 80386 CPU in this computer does not reliably
   execute 32-bit operations. Windows will usually work correctly
   on computers with this problem, but may occasionally fail.

<LI>WARNING: the Intel 80386 processor in the computer does not reliably
   execute 32-bit multiply operations, Windows usually works correctly
   on computers with this problem but may occasionally fail, you may want
   to replace your 80386 processor. Press any key to continue.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When Intel introduced the 80386 CPU, it released some chips that had not
been fully tested using 32-bit operations. Windows checks for this to warn
you that you may want to replace the CPU with one of the newer, more
reliable 80386 chips.
<P>
This is normally not a problem, as most programs do not use the true 32-
bit capabilities of the 80386 CPU. However, since Windows does use 32-bit
operations, you may experience problems.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 2.x</h3>
 
<P>
Two important files come with enhanced-mode Windows, WIN386.EXE and
WIN86.COM. WIN386.EXE provides memory management and support for standard
applications; WIN86.COM is essentially the same as Windows/286 without
support for standard applications. After WIN386.EXE is loaded, it creates
a virtual machine, loads WIN86.COM, and executes it.
<P>
If the problem seems to be resolved by running WIN86.COM instead of
WIN386.EXE, you may need to replace the CPU in your computer. If Windows
acts the same with either WIN386.EXE or WIN86.COM, the problem is probably
not related to the CPU.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 3.0, 3.1, and 3.11 and Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and 3.11</h3>
 
<P>
You must upgrade the 80386 CPU in your computer to work around this
problem.
<P>
