<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows 3.1 ships with one virtual hard-drive controller device:
WDCTRL. WDCTRL supports hard-drive controllers that are compatible with the
Western Digital WD1003 standard. According to Western Digital, it has two
hard-drive controller cards that are compatible with Windows 3.1 and the 32-
Bit Disk Access feature.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>WD1006 Controller Card</h3>
 
<P>
The Western Digital WD1006 hard-drive controller is compatible with the
WD1003 hard-drive controller in some cases. If the card is configured
correctly, it should work correctly with the 32-Bit Disk Access feature.
<P>
WD1006 has a jumper setting to specify whether the drive format is
compatible with the WD1003 standard. If the drive has more than eight
heads, the drive is slightly incompatible with the WD1003 standard when
used with the WD1006 hard-drive controller card. This is due to the way the
WD1006 numbers the heads differently than the WD1003. Using a jumper to
connect pins seven and eight will correct this problem. This problem does
not occur if the hard drive has less than eight heads.
<P>
Some original equipment manufacturers (OEM) of this hard-drive controller
may not follow the same jumper settings. Consult your documentation or call
your manufacturer before changing these jumper settings.
<P>
<P><h3>WD1007A ESDI Controller Card</h3>
 
<P>
According to Western Digital, the WD1007A ESDI controller card is
100-percent compatible with the WD1003 controller, and can be used
with the 32-Bit Disk Access feature in Windows 3.1.
<P>
The Western Digital products included here are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
