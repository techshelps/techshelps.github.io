The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information explains the dialing modifiers used in the
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Remote Access Services (RAS) client.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Touch-Tone Dialing and Pulse/Rotary Dialing</h3>
 
<P>
By default, Windows for Workgroups RAS uses your current telephone system
format for dialing (either touch-tone or pulse/rotary dialing). It may be
necessary to use touch-tone only, pulse/rotary only, or both to get an
outside line on some telephone systems.
<P>
Use the following information to switch between dialing scripts when
you enter numbers to dial:

<UL><LI>The letter "T" switches from pulse/rotary to touch-tone dialing.
<P>
   Example: If you are dialing from a telephone system that supports
   pulse/rotary dialing and you need to enter a touch-tone format for a
   calling card, the dial string is 555-5678T1234. Every digit after the
   "T" is in touch-tone format.

<LI>The letter "P" switches from touch-tone to pulse/rotary dialing.
<P>
   Example: If you are dialing from a telephone system that supports
   touch-tone dialing but it is connected to the telephone company through
   pulse/rotary dialing, the dial string is 123P555-5678. The "123" prefix
   tones may be used to access specific in-house functions or access
   specific telephone lines. Every digit after the "P" is in pulse/rotary
   format.

<LI>You can use the "T" and "P" switches together to switch between formats.
<P>
   Example: 555-1234P123T456 (tone-pulse-tone)
<P>
</UL><h3>Telephone Number Modifiers for RAS</h3>
 
<P>
The following telephone-number modifiers are used to help get an outside
line on some telephone systems.

<UL><LI>The comma (,) causes the dialing to pause briefly (two seconds for most
   modems) before continuing.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Example: 9,555-1234. The "9" is used on some telephone systems to get
      an outside line. The comma inserts a pause before dialing the
      telephone number. You can use as many commas as needed to create a
      longer pause before the telephone number is dialed.
</PRE>
<LI>The at sign (@) waits for extended silence before continuing. This
   symbol causes the modem to listen to silence for five seconds. If a
   five-second silence has not been detected within the period predefined
   in the BIOS S7 register of the modem (the default is 50 seconds), the
   modem disconnects. If five seconds of silence are detected, the modem
   continues dialing the dial string.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Example: 9@555-1212
</PRE>
<LI>The letter "W" waits for a dial tone before continuing (for modems
   operating at 2400 bits per second [BPS] or greater). This dial modifier
   causes the modem to wait for an additional dial tone before dialing the
   numbers that follow the "W." The length of time the modem waits is up to
   the value in the BIOS S7 register of the modem (the default is 50
   seconds). The modem can be instructed to dial through a private branch
   exchange (PBX) or a long-distance calling service that requires delays
   during dialing.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Example: 9W555-1212. The "9" accesses the outside (public) telephone
      line. The "W" causes the modem to wait 50 seconds for a secondary
      dial tone (unless the default value in the BIOS S7 register of the
      modem has been changed). Then the 555-1212 telephone number is
      dialed.
