The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If Windows for Workgroups Mail is unable to find the MASTER.GLB file
in the GLB subdirectory of the Workgroup Mail postoffice directory
structure, you will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Mail could not connect to your mail server

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Mail is unable to find MASTER.GLB under any one of the following
conditions:

<UL><LI>The Workgroup postoffice computer is unavailable.

<LI>The postoffice directory is not shared.

<LI>You are using the wrong workgroup postoffice name.

<LI>The workgroup postoffice name is invalid.

<LI>The ServerPath= line in your MSMAIL.INI file is incorrect.

<LI>NetWare connectivity is installed.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information describes these conditions in detail.
<P>
<P><h3>Workgroup Postoffice Computer Unavailable</h3>
 
<P>
To use the Windows for Workgroups mail system, one workgroup computer
must be set up as the postoffice. This computer handles user accounts
and mail messages for the workgroup. To provide these services, the
postoffice computer must contain the workgroup postoffice directory
structure and it must be running in 386 enhanced mode (it must also be
turned on).
<P>
NOTE: There can be only one postoffice per workgroup.
<P>
The Postoffice Directory Is Not Shared
 
<P>
If the postoffice computer is not sharing the postoffice directory
structure, no one will be able to access the postoffice. Workgroup
users will be able to work off line, but they will not be able to
receive or send messages.
<P>
Use File Manager to make sure the postoffice directory structure is
being shared on the postoffice computer.
<P>
Using Wrong Workgroup Postoffice Name
 
<P>
By default, the workgroup postoffice is named WGPO. However, in your
workgroup, the name may be different. Make sure the name you are using
for the postoffice is correct. (It should be the same as the share
name on the workgroup postoffice computer.)
<P>
<P><h3>Workgroup Postoffice Name is Invalid</h3>
 
<P>
By default, the workgroup postoffice is named WGPO. You can use
another name provided that it doesn't exceed 8 characters and doesn't
contain any spaces. For example, changing the share name from "WGPO"
to "Post Ofc" (without the quotation marks) would cause unsuccessful
connections. Make sure that the name each user is trying to connect to
matches the name that was used as the share name on the postoffice
computer.
<P>
To correct this error, change the share name of the postoffice
directory to a valid name with eight or fewer characters. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>Open File Manager on the postoffice machine.

<P><LI>Select the postoffice directory.

<P><LI>From the Disk menu, choose Share As.

<P><LI>From the Share Directory menu, change the Share Name entry to a
   name with eight or fewer characters. (Spaces count as characters.)
<P>
</OL><h3>ServerPath= Line in MSMAIL.INI Is Incorrect</h3>
 
<P>
When you log on to the workgroup mail system, Workgroup Mail checks
the ServerPath= line in your local MSMAIL.INI file to locate the post
office computer and directory structure.
<P>
If you are using universal naming convention (UNC) style paths to
refer to the postoffice computer, make sure the computer name and
share name are correct. If you are not sure of the names, you can use
File Manager to connect to the postoffice computer and verify the
computer and share names.
<P>
If you are using a redirected drive letter (M for example) for your
postoffice, make sure you have a network connection in File Manager
that agrees with the ServerPath= statement.
<P>
<P><h3>NetWare Connectivity Is Installed</h3>
 
<P>
When you load the real mode redirector, the NetWare portion of the
protocol stack intercepts Interrupt 21h calls before any other protocol
(such as Microsoft NetBEUI). When you start Mail, Interrupt 21h is used to
find the postoffice computer. This results in a problem if your post
office is referred to by a UNC style path. NetWare does not understand
UNC and does not forward the UNC information to NetBEUI. Therefore, if
NetWare connectivity is installed, Mail displays the error message if
you start the real mode redirector before you start Windows. To avoid
this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Switch to a redirected drive letter style path.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Do not load the real mode redirector before you start Windows.
<P>
</UL>To switch to a redirected drive letter style path:

<OL><P><LI>Add the following to the PROTOCOL.INI file.
<P>
   a. Increase the value for SESSIONS= to 20.
<P>
   b. Increase the value for NCBS= to 40.

<P><LI>In the MSMAIL.INI file, set the SERVERPATH= setting to the valid
   server drive (for example, SERVERPATH=M:).

<P><LI>Quit Windows and redirect the drive letter (M in this example) to
   the appropriate server and share name (\\&lt;servername&gt;\&lt;sharename&gt;).
<P></OL>
