The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows applications normally start in the directory in which the program
files are located. You may want to have a Windows application start in a
different directory when running under Microsoft Windows version 3.0. To
have a Windows application start up in a different directory, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the application's directory is listed in the DOS path
   statement.

<P><LI>Verify that an icon exists for this application and that clicking
   the icon runs the application.

<P><LI>Highlight the icon and from the Program Manager File menu, choose
   Properties.

<P><LI>Type the path of the new default directory in the command line of
   the Program Item Properties dialog box. For example, type
   "C:\XLDATA\EXCEL.EXE" (without the quotation marks) to have Excel
   start in the XLDATA directory.

<P><LI>At this point, you will get the error message "The specified path
   is invalid." Click OK to bypass this message.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Program Manager will search for the executable file in the
directory specified in the Command Line entry of the Program Item
Properties dialog box. If the file is not found in that directory, the
Program Manager will search the DOS path, leaving the specified
directory as the default.
<P>
There are two problems with this technique. First, when the Command
Line is originally entered in the Program Item Properties dialog box,
the error message "The specified path is invalid" will appear. This
indicates that Windows cannot find the executable file in the path
specified. This does not prohibit Windows from accepting the entry,
and Windows will add the program item to the group once OK is chosen.
<P>
The second drawback is that Windows will use the default application
program item icon instead of the program's actual icon when displaying
the program item in its group within the Program Manager. To correct
this behavior, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Select the icon in Program Manager.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Properties.

<P><LI>Select Change Icon.

<P><LI>Type the path to the executable file and press the ENTER key.
<P>
</OL>Pages 89-91 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for Windows
version 3.0 has more information about using Windows applications with
the Program Manager.
<P>
You may also have non-Windows applications start in different directories.
The best method of doing this is to specify the directory you want the
application to start in at the Start-Up Directory box within the PIF file
for that application.
