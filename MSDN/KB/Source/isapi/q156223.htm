<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft OLE libraries included with:
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
An OLE server that is an EXE must include the IUSR_computername Internet
guest account in its launch and access security permissions before it can
be launched by an ISAPI extension DLL. In addition, if the server is an EXE
server that is not a Win32 service, it must be configured to run under a
specific user account using the RunAs registry value.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Adding Launch and Access Permissions</h3>
 
<P>
In NT 4.0, EXE OLE servers use activation security to specify the security
contexts of clients that can activate the server. The server specifies this
by using the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AppID\{...}\LaunchPermission &amp;
AccessPermission keys or by defaulting to the default activation security
for all servers on a machine specified by the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\OLE\DefaultLaunchPermission and
DefaultAccessPermission keys. The values of these keys can be set using the
DCOMCNFG.EXE graphical utility included in NT 4.0. Activation security is
automatically applied by the Service Control Manager of a particular
machine. Upon receipt of a request to activate an object from a client
running in a different security context, the Service Control Manager checks
the request against the Access Control List (ACL) specified by the above
keys and will fail the activation if the client's security identifier is
not in the ACL.
<P>
The Internet Information Service (IIS) runs in the LocalSystem account.
However, the IIS thread that executes an ISAPI extension DLL impersonates
the IUSR_computername account, which is an Internet guest account created
when IIS is installed. The default launch and access permissions of OLE
servers do not give IUSR_computername permission to launch the server. As a
consequence, a CoCreateInstance call from an ISAPI extension DLL will fail
with E_ACCESSDENIED.
<P>
This problem can be solved by adding the IUSR_computername to the OLE
server's launch and access permissions using the DCOMCNFG.EXE utility.
<P>
IUSR_computername need not be added to the launch and access permissions
of inproc OLE servers. For inproc OLE servers, make sure that SYSTEM is
listed in the DefaultAccessPermissions, and CoCreateInstance will
succeed.
<P>
For example, use the following steps to add to the Default Launch and
Activation permissions:

<OL><P><LI>Launch DCOMCNFG.EXE, which can be found in the system32 directory of
   the Windows NT 4.0 installation.

<P><LI>Click the Default Security tab.

<P><LI>Click the Edit Default button in the Default Launch Permissions
   group.

<P><LI>Click the Add button in the Registry Value Permissions dialog.

<P><LI>Click the computer name from the “List Names From” combo box.

<P><LI>Click the Show Users button.

<P><LI>Select and add the IUSR_computername Internet Guest Account. For
   example, add IUSR_FOO, where FOO is the machine name. Click OK to get
   out of the dialogs, and then click Apply.

<P><LI>Similarly, add IUSR_computername to the Default Access Permissions.
<P>
</OL>The above process grants permission to launch all OLE servers.
Permission can also be granted to launch individual servers by selecting
the Applications tab in DCOMCNFG and selecting the server from the list of
servers, and by using the Properties button and the Security tab to add to
the permissions of an individual server.
<P>
<P><h3>Preventing USER32 Window Station/Desktop Failure</h3>
 
<P>
When IIS calls OleInitialize, OLE will cache the window station and desktop
that are connected to the IIS process in the LocalSystem account. The IIS
thread that executes the ISAPI extension DLL impersonates the
IUSR_computername account. When the extension DLL calls CoCreateInstance to
create an EXE server (which is not a service and is not marked with RunAs
in the registry), OLE will call CreateProcess to create the server and will
pass the cached window station and desktop in the STARTUPINFO parameter.
The server will be run in the client's security context (IUSR_computername)
because it is not a service and not marked with RunAs. The launched server
will cause the following USER32 error:
<P>
<PRE>   "Initialization of the dynamic linked library USER32.DLL failed. The
   process is terminating abnormally".

</PRE></OL>CoCreateInstance will then fail with CO_E_SERVER_EXEC_FAILURE. The error
occurs because the server is running in the IUSR_computername account
and therefore cannot connect to the window station and desktop of the IIS
process in the LocalSystem account. This USER32 failure will not occur
for inprocess servers because the server runs in the IIS process and
USER32 has already been initialized when the IIS process started.
<P>
This problem can be solved by configuring the server using the RunAs
registry value to run under a user account. This can be “Interactive
User” if an interactive user will be logged on, or can be a specific user
account if an interactive user will not be logged on. If “Interactive
User” is specified, the server will run in the interactive user's
account and will connect to the interactive desktop. If a specific user
account is specified, the server will run in that account and connect to
its own window station and desktop. As a consequence, the USER32 error
will not occur.
<P>
For example, use the following steps to configure a server to run under
a user account:

<OL><P><LI>Run DCOMCNFG.EXE.

<P><LI>Click the Applications tab, and then click the server.

<P><LI>Click the Properties button, and then click the Identity tab.

<P><LI>Select “The interactive user” if an interactive user will be logged
   on when the server is launched, or select “This user” and specify a user
   if an interactive user will not be logged on when the server is
   launched. This will add a RunAs registry entry under the APPID key of
   the server.

<P><LI>Make sure that the specified user is given launch and access
   permissions to the server.
<P>
</OL>DCOMCNFG will even allow adding the RunAs named value to old OLE servers
that did not provide an APPID key. It creates an APPID key for these
servers.
<P>
Another solution to this USER32 problem is to call RevertToSelf before
calling CoCreateInstance in the ISAPI extension. The thread will revert
from the IUSR_computername account to the LocalSystem account and the
launched server will run in the LocalSystem account. The USER32 error
will not occur because the server will be able to connect to the window
station and desktop of the IIS process, which also runs in the
LocalSystem account. However, running a server in LocalSystem has a
couple of problems:

<OL><P><LI>LocalSystem is a highly-privileged account, and running a server in it
   may give it more privileges than may be acceptable to you.

<P><LI>The server will not be able to call to another machine using any
   secure communications mechanism, including DCOM, because LocalSystem
   does not have network rights. Consequently, the first solution is
   recommended.
