The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you log on to a computer running Windows NT Workstation or Server, you
get a dialog box with the following error message or you get a blank
desktop:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't access this folder. The path is too long.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If a user logs on to a workstation (either locally or to a domain) and is
not listed by group or name to have any access permissions to the root
directory where the system files reside, the following problems can occur:

<UL><LI>If the user logs on to the domain from the workstation or member server,
   he or she will get a dialog box with the following error, followed by a
   blank desktop:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Can't access this folder. The path is too long.
</PRE><P>
   However, a profile is created in the %SystemRoot%\Profiles directory for
   that user.

<LI>If the workstation or server is not a member of a domain, or if the user
   decides to log on locally, the error message may or may not be
   displayed, but a blank desktop with the profile created in the profiles
   directory will occur.
<P>
</UL>The scenarios described above have only been confirmed with Windows NT 4.0
clients. The domain that a user logs on to can be either a Windows NT 3.51
or a Windows NT 4.0 domain with the same results. This is one type of
scenario that can occur if directory permissions are not set up properly on
a client.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P>
Log on as the local Administrator and verify that either the user or a
group (of which the user is a member) has at least read access to the root
of the system drive.  To accomplish this if the desktop is blank, follow
the procedure below:

<OL><P><LI> Bring up Task Manager by pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL.
</OL>2.  Select File, New Task
3.  In the run dialog box launch Explorer or Winfile.
4.  View the security permissions of the system drive.
<P>
If the user  or group does not have this access, add it to the directory
permissions for the user or group.  Do not select the Apply To
Subdirectories check box.
<P>
