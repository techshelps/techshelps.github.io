The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
</UL><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After applying any service pack to a computer outfitted with a #9FX Reality
332 video card that requires a third-party driver, the computer restarts to
a black screen and stops responding. This will also happen if an Emergency
Repair Disk (ERD) is run against the computer for repair purposes. Starting
the computer to VGA mode allows the computer to start; however, using the
Last Known Good Configuration will not.
<P>
Some Dell Dimensions XPS Pro 200 computers come with this video card, and
exhibit this problem.
<P>
The problem occurs if both of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>Windows NT 3.51 was initially installed using the third-party video
   driver.

<LI>The video card is set for at least 1280 X 768 resolution and 256 colors.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The #9FX Reality 332 video card is based on the S3 chipset and uses a set
of drivers with the same name as the standard S3 compatible video card;
S3.sys and S3.dll. However, the drivers that come with Windows NT 3.51 and
its service packs are not 100 percent compatible with this video adapter.
When applying the service pack or running an ERD, these files are replaced
by the standard S3 drivers, which cause the computer to fail. When Windows
NT 3.51 is preinstalled by the manufacturer, the standard S3 driver is not
used. The Last Known Good startup option does not work because the last
successful restart included drivers with the same name as the failed
attempt.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Obtain the correct drivers from Number Nine Visual Technology. You can
   obtain these drivers by connecting to <B><A HREF="http://www.nine.com/drivers.html">http://www.nine.com/drivers.html</A></B>
   and downloading the 325n3009.exe file.

<P><LI>Start the computer to VGA mode.

<P><LI>Install the newer drivers.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>

independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
