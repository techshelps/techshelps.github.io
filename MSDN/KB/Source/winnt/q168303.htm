<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the following error message in the system log of Event
Viewer when you use a PC Card:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 7000
   Source:  Service Control Manager
   Description:  A device attached to the system is not functioning

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the PC Card attempts to use an IRQ that is already
in use.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT does not provide a user interface to set a PC Card to a specific
IRQ. Therefore, you must edit the registry to resolve this problem.
<P>
NOTE: For these steps to work, you must already have Windows NT installed
on the computer that has the PC Card connected to it.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
Use Registry Editor to perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Pcmcia.
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Add Value.

<P><LI>Add the following values:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name:  InterruptMask
<PRE></PRE>      Data Type:   REG_DWORD
      Data:        see note below
      RADIX:       HEX

   NOTE: The Data field will actually be a four digit hexadecimal number.
   To determine the value of the data field you must know which IRQ's you
   are trying to mask or hide. You must also know what the valid IRQ's are
   for this card. You can use the Pcmcmd.exe command from the
   Support\Debug\i386 directory on the Windows NT 4.0 CD. Look for the IRQ
   Level Mask to get the valid IRQ's for the card.

   Each IRQ is represented by it's associated binary place holder 0 - 15.
   Each of the four hexadecimal numbers in the Data field represent 4
   binary digits of the Interrupt Mask. So if we had a PCMCIA card that
   could take IRQ 11, 10, 9, 7, 5, and 3, the default InterruptMask would
   be f157. Also, if you wanted to mask IRQ 5, you would set the 5th digit
   to 1 which could be achieved with a DATA value of f177. This would look
   similar to the following table:


   IRQ's:  15 14 13 12   11 10  9  8    7  6  5  4    3  2  1  0
   VALUE:   1  1  1  1    0  0  0  1    0  1  1  1    0  1  1  1 = f177

   A value of 1 in the mask makes the IRQ unavailable. A value of 0 leaves
   it available. With the preceding example, the f of f177 masks IRQ's 12-
   15, the 1 of f177 leaves IRQ 9, 10, 11, but masks 8. The middle 7 of
   f177 mask IRQ 4-6 and leaves 7 available, and the last 7 of f177 mask 0-
   2 and leaves 3 available.

</PRE><P><LI>Click OK, and then exit Regedt32.

<P><LI>Restart the computer and the PC Card should no longer select IRQ 5.
