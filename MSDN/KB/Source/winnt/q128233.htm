<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following article on Windows NT protocols is a copy of an article
published in Microsoft's "Premier Showing" newsletter.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>              Comparison of Windows NT Network Protocols

</PRE><h3>Overview</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides three transport drivers (i.e., protocols) with Windows
NT 3.5: TCP/IP, NWLink, and NBF. Windows NT 3.5 also ships with the DLC
protocol, which does not provide transport layer services. In this article
the terms TCP/IP, NWLink and NBF refer to the Windows NT transport drivers
that implement the Internet TCP/IP, Novell SPX/IPX and IBM NetBEUI network
protocol suites, respectively. This article compares these protocols as
implemented in the Windows NT 3.5 transport drivers, to assist users in
selecting the appropriate protocol(s) for their network.
<P>
Since each customer will be concerned with a different set of protocol
characteristics, this article does not recommend which protocol customers
should use. Instead, it discusses the merits of each, thereby enabling
customers to make the best choice for their environment. Microsoft will
continue to support these three protocols, today and in the long term.
<P>
Windows NT installs NWLink by default, primarily because IPX is the most
common protocol in PC networks and it has relatively simple configuration
requirements. However, administrators can modify setup.inf files to
install other protocols by default. This default setting does not imply
preference of NWLink over TCP/IP or NBF.
<P>
NOTE: In the Windows NT 3.51 release, TCP/IP is now installed by default.
<P>
Customers should generally use the minimum protocols necessary, because
multiple protocols usually result in the following:

<UL><LI>Higher memory requirement for clients.

<LI>More complex client configuration and network administration.

<LI>Higher support and software license costs.
<P>
</UL><h3>Windows NT Transport Driver Architecture</h3>
 
<P>
The Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS) standard, which was
originally developed for IBM by Sytek in 1983 defines two entities:

<UL><LI>A Session Layer interface that is a standard API for user applications
   to submit network I/O and control directives to underlying network
   protocol software. NetBIOS commands are submitted via Network Control
   Blocks (NCBs).

<LI>A session management/data transport protocol called NetBIOS Frames
   Protocol (NBFP). NBFP functions at the Session and Transport Layers to
   perform the network I/O to accommodate the NetBIOS interface command
   set.
<P>
</UL>An application program that uses the NetBIOS interface API for network
communication can operate on any transport driver that exposes the NetBIOS
interface. Transport drivers that do not implement NBFP (e.g., TCP/IP and
IPX) must expose the NetBIOS interface and have a means of mapping each
NetBIOS interface command to some sequence of their own native network
frames and protocols.
<P>
Unlike the 16 bit Windows, MS DOS and OS/2 versions of Microsoft Network
software, Windows NT transport drivers do not expose the NetBIOS interface;
instead, they expose the more flexible Transport Driver Interface (TDI).
Windows NT includes a NetBIOS Emulator to map NetBIOS commands to TDI
commands and events. Internal Windows NT network components use TDI
commands and events, rather than NetBIOS commands, to communicate with
underlying transport drivers.
<P>
The TDI clients require support for NetBIOS address format and message mode
data transfer. NBF supports this natively through NBFP. Transports that
do not include NBFP implement a  NetBIOS compatibility layer to resolve
NetBIOS format addresses to the transport's native address format, and to
implement message mode data transfer over the transport's native data
transfer protocol.
<P>
Windows NT transport drivers provide the services defined in several layers
of the OSI Reference Model:  Some Session Layer services; all Transport and
Network Layer services; and the services of the LLC sub layer of the Data
Link Layer. This constitutes all services between the TDI and the Network
Driver Interface Specification 3.0 (NDIS) interface. All Windows NT
transport drivers except DLC export the TDI interface at their upper edge
for communication with TDI client applications, such as the Windows NT
redirector and server. They export the NDIS interface at the lower edge
for communication with the underlying network interface card (NIC) driver.
<P>
<P><h3>Background on Windows NT Transport Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
NBF (NetBEUI)
<P>
IBM first introduced the NetBIOS Extended User Interface (NetBEUI) protocol
specification in 1985. It is optimized for departmental LANs or LAN
segments. The Windows NT NetBEUI Frame (NBF) transport driver implements
the IBM NetBEUI 3.0 specification, and is completely compatible with the
NetBEUI shipped with past Microsoft networking products. NBF implements
NBFP, and therefore requires no NetBIOS compatibility layer.
<P>
TCP/IP
<P>
Windows NT includes an implementation of the Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). In general usage, the term TCP/IP
refers to a suite of protocols that includes TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, and ARP.
Since TCP/IP is available for many diverse operating systems such as UNIX,
MVS, VM, VMS, NetWare and OS/2, Windows NT can use TCP/IP to communicate
with these different operating systems. TCP/IP also provides compatibility
with the global Internet. TCP/IP is Microsoft's strategic protocol for
scaleable Windows-based networking. The Windows NT TCP/IP transport driver
includes TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, ARP and NBT. Microsoft completely redesigned
the TCP/IP transport driver in Windows NT 3.5, providing many enhancements
over the Streams based TCP/IP transport driver in Windows NT 3.1. The
NetBIOS compatibility layer for TCP/IP is NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT in
Windows NT 3.5; NBT in Windows NT 3.1).
<P>
NWLink (IPX)
<P>
Novell NetWare currently has the largest market share among PC based
network operating systems. NetWare's native Network Layer protocol is IPX,
a Novell proprietary descendant of the Xerox XNS protocol. Microsoft
implements the lower level NetWare protocols in the NWLink transport
driver, which includes IPX, SPX, RIPX and NBIPX. The NetBIOS compatibility
layer for NWLink is NetBIOS over IPX, also known as NBIPX (NwLnkNb in
Windows NT 3.5; NWNBLink in Windows NT 3.1).
<P>
<P><h3>Comparing Transport Driver Characteristics</h3>
 
<P>
This section compares the Windows NT transport drivers in each of the
following areas:

<UL><LI>Industry acceptance and experience

<LI>Open or proprietary specifications

<LI>Interoperability

<LI>Simplicity of configuration and administration

<LI>Network segmentation

<LI>Routing capabilities

<LI>Name registration and resolution requirements

<LI>Network traffic

<LI>Network status reporting

<LI>Memory requirements

<LI>Performance

<LI>Application programming support
<P>
</UL>As mentioned previously, the customer's computing environment will
determine which protocol characteristics are desired, and which are most
important. The applicability and importance of the foregoing
characteristics will be dependent upon factors such as the following:

<UL><LI>Size of the network

<LI>Single or multiple locations

<LI>Homogeneous or heterogeneous nodes

<LI>Internet connectivity requirements

<LI>Application programming requirements

<LI>Size and expertise of support staff
<P>
</UL>Industry Acceptance and Experience
<P>
The more popular protocols have a larger based of experienced support and
design engineers. In late 1994 Sage Research, Inc. performed a study of
router based LAN backbones with at least 250 nodes in Fortune 500
companies. Their study concluded that TCP/IP is used on 95% of all such
networks, while SPX/IPX is used on 87%.

<UL><LI>NetBEUI usage is limited primarily to Microsoft and IBM PC network
   environments.

<LI>TCP/IP is widely accepted, established and understood, especially in
   UNIX and non PC networks. It is the protocol of the global Internet.

<LI>SPX/IPX is the most popular protocol in PC network environments.
<P>
</UL>Open or Proprietary Specifications
<P>
Open protocol specifications enable programmers to obtain all the
information necessary to develop their own protocol drivers without paying
license fees.

<UL><LI>NetBEUI is a proprietary specification owned by IBM. However, IBM makes
   this specification available to developers.

<LI>TCP/IP is an open specification. Anyone can easily obtain RFCs for
   implementing the TCP/IP protocols. Anyone can also submit RFCs to the
   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for consideration.

<LI>SPX/IPX is a proprietary specification owned by Novell, which can make
   it difficult to obtain specifications for the upper layers like NCP.
   However, Novell has made the new SPX II specification available.
<P>
</UL>Interoperability
<P>
The availability of a protocol on a variety of operating systems and
hardware platforms provides the advantage of interoperability. Windows NT
provides native support for NetBEUI, TCP/IP and SPX/IPX through the NBF,
TCP/IP and NWLink transport drivers.

<UL><LI>NetBEUI is limited almost exclusively to Microsoft and IBM PC networks:
   Microsoft LAN Manager, Windows NT, Windows for Workgroups; LAN Manager
   for UNIX; and IBM PCLAN and LAN Server environments.

<LI>TCP/IP is available on a wide variety of operating systems such as
   Windows NT, UNIX, NetWare, VMS, VM, MVS, MS DOS, Macintosh, and OS/2.
   It is the protocol of the global Internet. NetWare/IP will enable
   NetWare customers to run TCP/IP-only networks, accessing NetWare
   services without requiring SPX/IPX. However, NetWare/IP is not native
   IP for NetWare; it emulates the IPX stack to NCP, which still requires
   an underlying IPX (or emulated IPX) layer. In comparison, Windows NT
   provides true protocol independent networking, running SMBs over its
   transport drivers without emulation requirements.

<LI>IPX is the native protocol of Novell NetWare. However, SPX/IPX is also
   available on other operating systems:  Microsoft provides NWLink for
   Windows NT; TGV provides IPX for DEC VMS; Novell offers IPX on UnixWare.
<P>
</UL>Simplicity of Configuration and Administration
<P>
Administrators of any size network desire simplicity of client
configuration and network administration. Large sites have many clients to
configure, while small sites may not have sufficient support personnel.
All three protocols are self tuning in their Windows NT 3.5 implementation.
However, Microsoft exposes certain tuning parameters for manual
configuration in special situations.

<UL><LI>NBF requires little or no initial configuration or network
   administration.

<LI>TCP/IP is potentially difficult to configure due to the relative
   complexity of its multi part naming scheme, and the fact that a default
   gateway (router) must be identified for each station. To reduce the
   client configuration burden, Windows NT 3.5 supports the Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP), an open standard that transparently
   provides dynamic negotiation of client configuration. DHCP clients
   require no manual IP configuration, and administrators do not have to
   manually assign IP addresses. However, DHCP does require proper planning
   and administration of DHCP servers.

<LI>NWLink requires little or no initial client configuration on small non
   routed networks. The node ID component of the IPX address is simply the
   six byte MAC address of the NIC. This simple node ID eliminates the need
   for manual client configuration. Configuring a server's external and
   internal networks is more complex, however.
<P>
</UL>Network Segmentation
<P>
Administrators of large networks desire the ability to differentiate
between multiple interconnected networks. Hierarchical network addresses
provide the ability to manage a hierarchy of subnetworks within networks,
allowing smarter forwarding and security. Creating smaller segments with
fewer stations produces more manageable networks with reduced traffic
levels. This ability may not be critical for small networks.

<UL><LI>NetBEUI uses a single part naming scheme, and therefore has no facility
   for differentiating between multiple interconnected networks.

<LI>TCP/IP uses a multi part naming scheme that allows very large multi
   location networks to be logically segmented into multiple levels of
   subnets. Network administrators can use the network ID component of the
   IP address in conjunction with a subnet mask to configure and manage
   subnetworks within subnetworks. IP uses subnetworks to logically segment
   large networks into separate, smaller interconnected subnetworks.

<LI>IPX uses a simple two part naming scheme that allows large multi
   location networks to be logically segmented into multiple subnets.
   However, the IPX network ID is not hierarchical; it does not divide into
   subcomponents.
<P>
</UL>Routing Capabilities
<P>
Multi location networks require routing capabilities, while single location
networks have little use for such capabilities. Routable protocols do not
generally allow broadcast packets to traverse routers, thereby reducing
network congestion. Both IP and IPX are natively routable; they do not
require encapsulation for routing. Both employ interior gateway protocols
(IGPs) to exchange routing information among routers within an autonomous
network (i.e., a group of nodes controlled by a single administrative
authority). One of the most common IGPs is the Routing Information
Protocol (RIP), which uses a vector distance algorithm to determine optimum
routes. The RIP implementations used in IP and IPX are based upon the XNS
RIP developed by Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC).

<UL><LI>NetBEUI is not routable. NBF does support a simple form of routing known
   as Token ring Source Routing, offered only on Token Ring networks.
   However, source routing is not actually implemented at the OSI Network
   Layer.

<LI>TCP/IP packets are routeable by third-party routers that use RIP, IGPs
   such as Cisco Systems' Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP), or
   IETF's Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol, even though Windows NT
   itself does not understand these protocols. However, if MPR is
   installed, Windows NT uses RIP. You may configure Windows NT as a static
   TCP/IP router by checking the Enable IP Routing check box in Control
   Panel. Dynamic routing must be implemented with third party routers.

<LI>Windows NT cannot act as an IPX router, but IPX provides full inter
   network routing support. NWLink uses Routing Information Protocol over
   IPX (RIPX) to implement route and router discovery services used by SPX
   and NBIPX. When NWLink loads, it sends out a RIPX request for a network
   number to be used for addressing at the IPX level. NetWare servers
   respond with a RIP packet containing the network number of the local
   network. If there is no RIPX response, NWLink uses 0 for the network
   number and indicates that the IPX packet is for the local subnet.
<P>
</UL>Name Registration and Resolution Requirements
<P>
Name resolution requirements impact the simplicity of client configuration
and network administration. The methods of name registration and
resolution impact the amount of broadcast or multicast activity present on
the network, discussed later in the section on network traffic.
<P>
NetBIOS Name Registration
<P>
All transport drivers must register NetBIOS names to ensure that each
name is unique.
<P>
NetBIOS Name Resolution
<P>
Application Layer names (NetBIOS and Sockets host names) must ultimately
resolve to Data Link Layer (MAC) addresses. Transport drivers that do
not process NetBIOS names natively have an intermediate name resolution
step at the Network Layer, where the NetBIOS names resolve to the
transport's native address format.

<UL><LI>NBF uses NetBIOS names natively, then resolves them to MAC addresses.

<LI>In TCP/IP, NetBT resolves NetBIOS names to IP addresses, which then
   resolve to MAC addresses via ARP cache or broadcast.

<LI>In NWLink, NBIPX resolves NetBIOS names to IPX addresses. IPX
   addresses contain the MAC address as the host ID, so IPX requires no
   further resolution.
<P>
</UL>Sockets Host Name Resolution
<P>
For Windows Sockets applications, TCP/IP resolves host names to IP
addresses, which then resolve to MAC addresses.
<P>
Network Traffic
<P>
The method of name registration and resolution often impacts the amount of
broadcast or multicast (limited broadcast) activity present on the network.
Broadcast and multicast activity uses network bandwidth on the local
segment and on all bridged segments, and consumes processing cycles on
every network station the same protocol. Protocols with a high level of
broadcast or multicast activity are not generally well suited for large
networks.
<P>
Name Registration Broadcasts
<P>
NetBIOS names must be registered to ensure that each name is unique.
All transport drivers use broadcast, with one exception. In TCP/IP,
WINS clients send directed name registration request to the WINS server.
Non WINS clients may use WINS proxy agent for name resolution, but rely
on broadcast for name registration. The MS DOS WINS clients send
directed name resolution requests to the WINS server, but rely on
broadcast for name registration.
<P>
Name Resolution Broadcasts
<P>
Name resolution may be accomplished by broadcast, cached mappings,
lookup in a local mapping file or query a name service.

<UL><LI>NBF does not cache NetBIOS names that have already been resolved to
   MAC addresses. NBF also does not use a mapping file or name service.
   Therefore, NBF will generate multicast activity each time a link to
   another station is re established.

<LI>TCP/IP in Windows NT 3.5 provides many options for name resolution,
   resulting in few broadcasts if configured properly. For NetBIOS name
   resolution, TCP/IP can use cache, LMHOSTS lookup, WINS query,
   broadcast, DNS query and HOSTS lookup. For host name resolution,
   TCP/IP can use all of these methods except cache. Regardless of the
   method used for resolving NetBIOS and host names, IP must resolve IP
   addresses to MAC addresses. This final resolution stage is
   accomplished by ARP cache or ARP broadcast.

<LI>NWLink uses broadcast to resolve names to addresses. However, NWLink
   reduces name resolution broadcast activity by caching NetBIOS name to
   IPX address mappings. NWLink does not use an address mapping file or
   name service. A future version may implement a name service similar
   to WINS or DNS.
<P>
</UL>Router Broadcasts
<P>
NetBEUI is not routable, and therefore has no impact on router
broadcasts. Dynamic IP and IPX routers maintain routing tables by
issuing a RIP broadcast on every port at regular intervals. IP
broadcasts every 30 seconds; IPX, every 60 seconds. All NetWare file
servers are inherently routers, and therefore issue RIP broadcasts. IP
RIP allows for active or passive participants. Active participants
issue RIP broadcasts; passive or silent participants only listen. IP
routers are active whereas IP hosts are typically passive.
Unfortunately, IP RIP does not communicate with IPX RIP, resulting in
redundant RIP broadcasts on networks running both IP and IPX.
<P>
SAP Broadcasts
<P>
IPX servers use the Service Advertising Protocol (SAP) to automatically
notify other IPX nodes of their presence and the services they provide.
IPX servers, but not routers, issue SAP broadcasts every 60 seconds.
Clients use SAP to determine what network resources are available.
These SAP broadcasts may cause congestion on networks with numerous
services, especially over WAN links. NWLink does not issue SAP
broadcasts.
<P>
To address this problem on NetWare, Novell implemented SAP filters and
the NetWare Link Service Protocol (NLSP) in its Multiprotocol Router
(MPR) with NetWare 4.x. NLSP couples OSPF-based route information with
Novell's SAP functions, substantially reducing the overhead traffic
commonly generated by RIP and SAP.
<P>
DHCP Broadcasts
<P>
DHCP will greatly simply IP client configuration. However, DHCP will
slightly increase network traffic. DHCP accomplishes client
configuration negotiation through broadcast. Once the client accepts
the IP address offered by the DHCP server, all activity is by directed
packets. Since DHCP servers act autonomously, there is no replication
traffic between DHCP servers.
<P>
WINS Replication
<P>
WINS can significantly reduce name query broadcasts. However, WINS will
introduce network traffic for replication among multiple WINS servers.
If configured properly, this replication traffic will be minimal and the
net effect will be reduced network traffic.
<P>
Network Status Reporting

<UL><LI>NBF does not provide any information about the state of the network.

<LI>TCP/IP routers use ICMP to notify the source that errors have been
   encountered, such as Destination Unreachable, Source Quench, etc.

<LI>IPX does not provide any information about the state of the network.
   IPX has no internet control management protocol, such as TCP/IP's ICMP.
   An IPX router has no way to indicate to a sending station that a
   destination is unreachable, that it should decrease its transmission
   rate, etc.
<P>
</UL>Memory Requirements
<P>
Network administrators generally desire a small memory footprint,
especially on clients. Protocol memory requirements are typically a
characteristic of the transport driver implementation rather than the
protocol itself.

<UL><LI>NBF has relatively small memory usage.

<LI>TCP/IP and IPX have similar memory usage requirements, but require more
   than NBF.
<P>
</UL>Performance
<P>
Protocol performance is typically dependent upon the efficiency and tuning
of the transport driver implementation rather than the protocol itself.

<UL><LI>NBF is tuned for small LAN communication, and therefore is very fast.
   Its performance across WANs is poor.

<LI>TCP/IP is not as fast as NBF on small LANs. The TCP/IP driver in Windows
   NT 3.1 was significantly slower than NBF on a local area network.
   However, the re designed TCP/IP in Windows NT 3.5 is only slightly
   slower than NBF.

<LI>NWLink is not as fast as NBF on small LANs. The NWLink driver in Windows
   NT 3.1 was significantly slower than NBF on a local area network.
   However, the re designed NWLink in Windows NT 3.5 is only slightly
   slower than NBF.

<LI>IPX/SPX protocols have some significant performance limitations in a
   routed (wide-area) network, which is why Novell has been modifying them
   with "packet burst" and "SPX II" changes.

<LI>IPX is only slightly faster than TCP/IP for file and print operations,
   and only slightly slower than TCP/IP for application services.
<P>
</UL>Application Programming Support

<UL><LI>NBF enables NetBIOS, Named Pipes, Mailslot, NetDDE, RPC over NetBIOS,
   and RPC over Named Pipes programming using NBFP. NBF does not support
   Sockets or RPC over Sockets programming.

<LI>TCP/IP enables Sockets and RPC over Sockets application programming over
   TCP and UDP. TCP/IP also enables NetBIOS, Named Pipes, Mailslot, NetDDE,
   RPC over NetBIOS and RPC over Named Pipes programming over NBT.

<LI>IPX enables Sockets and RPC over Sockets application programming over
   SPX and IPX. IPX also enables NetBIOS, Named Pipes, Mailslot, NetDDE,
   RPC over NetBIOS and RPC over Named Pipes programming over NBIPX. IPX
   supports Socket IDs for use by Sockets applications and other
   applications that use IPX directly. This direct hosting capability
   allows IPX to realize performance advantages for small I/O by bypassing
   NBIPX and calling IPX directly.

</PRE></UL>Other Considerations
<P>
Users who wish to connect to the global Internet must obtain a network ID
from InterNIC. The supply of unallocated IP addresses on the global
Internet is rapidly declining. In an effort to address this problem the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has formed IP Version 4 Address
Lifetime Estimation (IPv4 ALE) working group to determine how much longer
IPv4 can last. The IETF is also developing IP Version 6 (IPv6), also known
as IP Next Generation (IPng), to replace the current IPv4. IPng increases
the IPv4 addresses from four bytes (32 bits) to sixteen bytes (128 bits).
However, there is much controversy over IPng.
