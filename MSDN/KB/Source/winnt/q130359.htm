The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists high speed (28,800 bits per second [bps]) V.fast and
V.34 modems supported by Windows NT 3.5 Remote Access Service (RAS) that
are not on the printed Windows NT 3.5 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL).
<P>
This article also discusses the V.fast and V.34 communication standards and
how they affect RAS. This information can be used to help you decide which
modem to buy, or if you already bought a modem, how to make your modem work
with RAS.
<P>
NOTE: The V.fast standard is also known as V.fc. The fc in V.fc stands for
fast class.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to buy a supported modem for use with RAS, you should look for
a modem on the list below. When Windows NT 3.5 was released the final
version of the V.34 communication standard had just been defined and not
many V.34 modems were available. Therefore, most supported high speed
modems comply only with the temporary V.fast standard.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>V.fast Modems, V.34 Modems, and Modems Supporting V.fast and V.34</h3>
 
<P>
By early 1995, manufacturers provided upgrade paths for many of the listed
modems to support both V.fast and V.34 simultaneously. While there is no
guarantee that these upgraded modems are compatible with RAS, the chances
are good that they will work with RAS. However, if a V.fast modem was
upgraded to only support V.34, chances are higher that it has become
incompatible with the current driver in the RAS MODEM.INF file.
<P>
If you know how to use modem commands and know the syntax of the MODEM.INF
file, you can modify the MODEM.INF file to make your modem work with RAS.
If you buy an upgraded version of a V.fast modem listed below that now
supports both V.fast and V.34, few or no changes to the MODEM.INF file are
required. However, the modem may only be able to negotiate the V.fast
standard with another modem when used with the current RAS MODEM.INF file.
This can be a problem when you call a RAS server that has a plain V.34
modem. The V.34 standard does not define fall back to V.fast during
protocol negotiation, therefore your modem will connect using V.32bis, the
next lower communications standard which allows only 14,400 bps
connections.
<P>
If you need to modify the MODEM.INF file, see the Modifying MODEM.INF topic
in the Windows NT RAS Help file and refer to your modem command reference
manual.
<P>
If your modem is not on the supported list, check with your modem
manufacturer about the availability of a custom Windows NT RAS MODEM.INF
file section to make your modem work with RAS. If your manufacturer has a
MODEM.INF section for only Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS, you can use
that section with Windows NT. If you use a Windows for Workgroups RAS
MODEM.INF section, Windows NT RAS will not be able to autodetect your
modem. However, this should not be a problem, because you can select your
modem driver manually.
<P>
<P><h3>V.fast and V.34 Modems Supported by Windows NT 3.5</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows NT 3.5 MODEM.INF file supports the following 28,800 bps V.fast
and V.34 modems. These are external modems, unless otherwise noted. There
are only two V.34 modems listed.
<P>
The Modem Names in MODEM.INF column lists the supported modems by using the
titles of the modem sections exactly as they appear in the MODEM.INF file.
These titles also appear in Windows NT Control Panel in the RAS modem
selection list, but without the square brackets. The list shows US modems
in alphabetical order and three German modems at the end.
<P>
The Supported Standards and Comments column gives some additional
information, but is not a complete list of modem features.
