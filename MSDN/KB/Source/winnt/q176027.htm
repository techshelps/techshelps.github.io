<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
NetWare clients are unable to log on to a Windows NT Server computer
running File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW), and the following error
is recorded in the Event Log on the Windows NT Server:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID 2026:
   The server detected a request taking too long for client
   not-logged-in on connection 52, the connection has been disconnected.

   NOTE: The connection number may vary with this error.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error is caused when the FPNW service times out a request from a
client because it is taking too much time to process the client's request.
<P>
When the FPNW server can not complete the request, it will send a busy
response to the client, and the client will resend the request. By default,
FPNW will send 240 busy responses to a client before logging this error and
disconnecting the client.
<P>
This problem can occur when the FPNW server is unable to contact a domain
controller from a trusted domain. When attempting to authenticate NetWare
Compatible users, the FPNW server hands off the request to the local
security authority (LSA). Because there is no domain name specified in a
NetWare login request, the LSA will search its own account database, then
the account databases on each trusted domain for a matching user account.
<P>
When the LSA is unable to contact a domain controller from a trusted
domain, the login process on the FPNW server will timeout, fail the login
request, and log the error noted above in the Event Log.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, delete and recreate the trust relationships
between the domain of the FPNW server and any of its trusted domains. If a
trust cannot be established because a domain controller of the remote
domain cannot be contacted, do not recreate this trust until proper
communications with the remote domain can be established.
