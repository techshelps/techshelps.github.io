The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Windows NT Server as a Backup Domain Controller (BDC), the
following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The dependency or group failed to start. This error prevented the
   network from starting. As a result you will be unable to join a
   domain at the present time.

</PRE>When you install Windows NT Server as a Server, the local account cannot be
created and the installation fails.
<P>
These problems occurs on computers using:

<UL><LI>Compaq NetFlex-2 or NetFlex-L network adapters with the PCNTN3.SYS
   driver.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Compaq 32-bit Dualspeed Token Ring adapters.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the default NonPagePool memory space is depleted
and the pool attempts to expand with each memory request. Consequently, the
network adapter and network driver fail to allocate memory during the
initialization, and therefore fail to load.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Remove multiple network or SCSI adapters during the installation of
   Windows NT Server in order to eliminate extra resource requirements.

<P><LI>Add the adapters after the successful installation of Windows NT Server.
   You may have to use different network adapters during the installation
   process. Some network adapter drivers require large amount of
   NonPagePool memory during installation.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you experience this problem on a Compaq computer and network card,
install Windows NT Server using the Compaq SmartStart CD.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
The Compaq products discussed here are manufactured by Compaq Computer
Corp., a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied
or otherwise, regarding the products' performance or reliability.
