The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A network client is unable to browse computers that reside on the primary
domain controller's (PDC’s) own segment by means of File Manager or
Network Neighborhood. All other segments are visible and can be browsed.
However, the client is able to connect to any computer on the PDCs
segment, as long as the server name is known.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The PDC for the domain is also running Windows Internet Name Service
(WINS), and that server is on the PowerPC, MIPS, or Alpha platforms. If
nbtstat -n is run from the PDC, it will show that the domainname&lt;1D&gt; is in
conflict. This happens when a segment master browser for the domain (on a
different segment than the PDC) releases its names during a shutdown. When
that computer releases the domainname&lt;1D&gt;, the WINS server/PDC logs a
duplicate name error, and shows its own &lt;1D&gt; entry to be in conflict. If
the domainname&lt;1D&gt; name is not registered in the WINS database, the WINS
server will always discard that entry. But, it is necessary for the name to
be registered by means of NetBT (the NetBIOS interface on TCP/IP), as that
is the name that the server listens to and mailslot browser broadcasts on.
<P>

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Browsing a Wide Area Network with WINS

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, perform one of the following:

<UL><LI>Move the WINS service off of the PDC to another server.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Run your PDC/WINS server on a different platform, for example, Intel.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>For Windows NT 4.0, obtain the latest service pack, but for Windows NT
   3.51 obtain the hotfix mentioned below.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51
and 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
