The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and attempt to restore the
registry information of a specific key by choosing Restore from the
Registry menu, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Registry Editor could not accomplish the requested operation.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error can be caused by trying to restore a key that was saved with the
Save Subtree As... option from the registry menu. This cause is described
in this article.
<P>
Additionally, attempting to use Load Hive with a key that was saved using
Save Subtree As... causes the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Registry Editor could not load the key.
   The file is not a valid registry file.

</PRE>The error message indicated in the Symptoms section can also be caused by
opening the registry of a remote computer and attempting to save the
registry information of a specific key by clicking Save Key from the
Registry menu.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Registry Editor Save Key Saves Key on Wrong Computer

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
When saving the key, instead of clicking the Save Subtree As... option,
click the Save Key option from the Registry menu. When trying to restore
the key, click the Restore option from the Registry menu. The saved key
will be restored without error.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Save Key option saves, as a file, the information contained in a
registry key and in all of its subkeys. A file created using Save Key can
be loaded into the registry (with Load Hive), or can be restored (with
Restore). This format is readable by the Registry Editor and should be used
when trying to move or save registry keys from one registry to another.
<P>
The Save Subtree As... option saves the contents of the currently selected
key as a text file, including all subkeys and value entries for that key.
This format is used to provide a user readable text format for verifying
all of the entries in a key or subkey, and it is not meant to move or save
registry keys.
