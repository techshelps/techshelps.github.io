The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server Version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start an Intel processor-based system from the three setup disks
that come with Small Business Server, or when you start Setup on a DEC
Alpha (RISC) system from the Small Business Server compact disc, you never
get the option to run through the repair process.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The three SBS setup disks and the compact disc are programmed to perform
an unattended installation of Small Business Server and related components
and, therefore, bypass the screen that offers the repair option.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>On an Intel System</h3>
 

<UL><LI>On the second setup disk, rename Winnt.sif to Winnt.bak. You can
   restart from these disks and it will prompt you to run the Repair
   process.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Re-create a second set of setup disks by using the Small Business
   Server distribution compact disc (not a retail version of Windows NT
   4.0 Server or Workstation).
<P>
   To do this, go to any computer running the retail version of Windows
   NT. Place the first Small Business Server distribution compact disc
   into the CD-ROM drive and type the following at a command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      D:\i386\winnt32 /ox
</PRE><P>
   Alternately, go to an MS-DOS/Windows-based computer and type the
   following at the command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      D:\i386\winnt /ox
</PRE><P>
</UL>For additional information on creating three setup disks, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q131735.htm">Q131735</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Create Windows NT Boot Floppy Disks

</PRE><h3>On a DEC Alpha (RISC) System</h3>
 
<P>
If a retail version of Windows NT Server (non-SBS) compact disc is
available, use the Alpha firmware utilities to start the Windows NT setup
process from the retail version of Windows NT Server compact disc. When
you are presented with the screen that says "Welcome to Setup," replace
the Windows NT Server compact disc with the first compact disc of Small
Business Server. Select "R" to repair the system and then continue with
the emergency repair.
<P>
WARNING: Do not attempt to repair the system with the retail version of
Windows NT Server compact disc. Doing so will produce unpredictable and
undesirable results.
<P>
If a retail version of Windows NT Server compact disc is not available,
you can use the following steps to perform the repair.

<OL><P><LI>Install a new copy of Small Business Server (install Windows NT only --
   do not install the Server Applications, for example, Microsoft Exchange
   Server, SQL Server, and so on), or Windows NT Workstation into a
   directory other than Winnt.sbs. If you are installing Small Business
   Server, you will be informed during the installation that the Winnt.sbs
   directory already exists. Press ESC and type in a new directory name,
   such as Repair.
<P>
   NOTE: The Small Business Server installation requires 2 GB of free hard
   disk drive space. If 2 GB of space is not available, the installation
   will fail and the only workaround is to use a Windows NT Workstation or
   Windows NT Server compact disc.

<P><LI>Start into this new working installation.

<P><LI>Run Winnt32.exe from the Alpha directory of the first Small Business
   Server compact disc. This will copy some temporary files to the hard
   drive, create a new entry in the Alpha Boot menu called
   Installation/Upgrade.

<P><LI>Restart the server and select the Installation/Upgrade selection on the
   Boot menu. When you get to the screen that says "Welcome to Setup,"
   select "R" to repair.

<P><LI>After the repair is finished, you may remove the extra entries from the
   Alpha Boot menu and delete the temporary directory $WIN_NT$.~LS from
   drive C.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft BackOffice Small
Business Server version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
