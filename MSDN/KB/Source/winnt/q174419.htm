<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The growing Internet community developed the need for the allocation of
smaller portions of full IP networks. In an effort to support this growing
need, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has submitted an Internet-
Draft for RFC. This article discusses how to implement the suggestions in
the Internet-Draft for RFC to configure reverse lookup zones for a
Microsoft Windows NT Domain Name Service (DNS) Server using subnetted IP
networks.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A "classful" IP addressing scheme is one that does not break an IP network
down into smaller segments. For example, a class C address of 192.168.1.0
with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 is a classful IP addressing scheme.
<P>
A "classless" IP addressing scheme is one that uses a subnet mask to divide
an IP address into smaller segments. For example, a class C address of
192.168.1.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192 is a classless IP
addressing scheme. Along with this network, you would also have the
following IP network addresses: 192.168.1.64, 192.168.1.128, and
192.168.1.192.
<P>
The above-mentioned Internet Draft for RFC suggests several ways to
configure reverse lookup zones for DNS servers. This allows flexibility of
ownership of the primary DNS server and the ability for a small business to
register their own name with the Internic, instead of being a secondary
zone to an Internet Solution Provider (ISP) and sharing that ISP's Fully
Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). It also allows you, as the administrator of a
small business, to make necessary changes to the DNS records without having
to make a request for change through your ISP. These files can also be
shared with your ISP, whose role would then assume that of a secondary DNS
server through zone transfers.
<P>
The registered owner of the IP address range, typically the ISP, will
determine who will be the Start of Authority (SOA) for the address range.
Either you or the ISP can be SOA for the subnetted range. You and the ISP
must agree upon using classless delegation. The Internic must be contacted
to register the domain name and the associated name servers (NS). If you
are granted SOA, then your DNS server will be configured as the primary DNS
server. Your ISP can then configure their DNS server as a secondary DNS
server.
<P>
Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 DNS does support classless reverse
lookup zones, or in-addr.arpa delegations; however, the Microsoft DNS
Manager was not originally designed to read or edit these types of records.
<P>
The DNS Manager can be used to set up the primary zone and reverse lookup
zone for that Name Server (NS). After the primary zone and in-addr.arpa
zones are created, the in-addr.arpa file created will need to be manually
edited to support the classless or subnetted reverse lookup records. This
is because of the fact that it is not possible to do classless in-addr.arpa
with the DNS Manager tool shipped in Windows NT 4.0 for (at minimum) two
reasons:

<UL><LI>DNS Manager cannot create a CNAME resource record in a reverse lookup
   zone.

<LI>DNS Manager cannot create a PTR resource record that has more than four
   octets in the owner name.
<P>
</UL>When you create classless reverse lookup zones, you use notation such as
the following:
<P>
<PRE>   0/25.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa

</PRE>This indicates that the subnetted reverse zone is the 0 subnetwork that is
using 25 bits for its subnet mask. Here are some examples of class C
subnetted addresses:
<P>
<PRE>   If the subnet mask is:              the subnet/bit-count is:

   255.255.255.128                     128/25
   255.255.255.192                      64/26
   255.255.255.224                      32/27
   255.255.255.240                      16/28
   255.255.255.248                       8/29
   255.255.255.252                       4/30

</PRE>NOTE: This is not an all-inclusive list and your subnet/bit-count will
depend solely upon the subnet mask and IP address range that your ISP
assigns to you.
<P>
The following example assumes that you are going to be SOA for your own
domain. To create a classless reverse lookup zone, use the following steps:
<P>
NOTE: The following steps assume that the Microsoft DNS Server has been
installed and that the TCP/IP properties have been configured correctly.
For these steps use Domain.com for the domain name, replace Domain.com with
your actual domain name and replace the addresses listed in the example
with your IP addresses.

<OL><P><LI>Apply the latest Microsoft Windows NT Service Pack.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.

<P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then
   click DNS Manager.

<P><LI>Click New Server on the DNS menu, type the IP address or host name of
   your DNS Server, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Create two reverse lookup zones using the following steps:
<P>
   a. Click your DNS server, and then click New Zone on the DNS menu.
<P>
   b. Click the Primary radio button in the Creating New Zone dialog box,
<P><PRE>      and then click Next.
</PRE><P>
   c. Type 100.168.192.in-addr.arpa in the Zone Name text box, and then
<P><PRE>      press Tab.
</PRE><P>
   d. The Zone File text box should automatically be populated with
<P><PRE>      100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.dns.
</PRE><P>
   e. Click Finish.
<P>
   f. Repeat steps a through e, but substitute the following information:
<P>
<PRE>         Zone Name: 0/25.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa
         Zone File: 0.25.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.dns

   g. Create the forward lookup zone by repeating steps a through e again,
      but substituting the following information:

         Zone Name: Domain.com
         Zone File: Domain.com.dns

</PRE><P><LI>Click the newly created Domain.com zone, and then click New Record on
   the DNS menu. Verify that A Record is selected in the Record Type list
   box.
<P>
   NOTE: You cannot use the New Host option to add this record. It will not
   allow the creation of an A record without a Host Name.

<P><LI>Leave the Host Name text box empty and type 255.255.255.128 in the Host
   IP Address text box. Click to clear the Create Associated PTR Record
   check box.
<P>
   NOTE: 255.255.255.128 is representing the subnet mask that your ISP has
   assigned to you. Replace this with your actual subnet mask.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Click New Host on the DNS menu to create all of the appropriate A
   records with the host names that you need to resolve to IP addresses
   using DNS. Verify that the Create Associated PTR Record check box is
   clear while creating these A records.

<P><LI>When you have finished creating your A records, stop the DNS Server
<P><PRE>    using one of the following methods:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     - Use the Services tool in Control Panel:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
<PRE></PRE>          double-click the Services icon.

       2. Select Microsoft DNS Server in the Service list and click Stop.

       -or-

     - Type the following at a command prompt and press Enter:

          net stop dns

    NOTE: It is important to stop the DNS service before editing the Zone
    files or you may lose manually recorded information.

</PRE><P><LI>Using a text editor, add the following text to the end of the
<P><PRE>    100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.dns file in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Dns
    folder:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>       1        IN CNAME   1.0/25
       2        IN CNAME   2.0/25
       3        IN CNAME   3.0/25

    where the number 1 above indicates the fourth octet of the host
    computer. The entries in this file merely refer to the appropriate
    entries in the file in step 12.

</PRE><P><LI>Using a text editor, add the following text to the end of the
<P><PRE>    0.25.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.dns file in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Dns
    folder:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>       1        IN PTR   &lt;Server&gt;.Domain.com.

    where &lt;Server&gt;.domain.com. is the FQDN of the DNS server that is SOA
    for this sub-zone. The number 1 above indicates the fourth octet of
    this server's IP address, for example, 192.168.100.1.

    NOTE: Below the earlier &lt;Server&gt;.Domain.com. entry, add other host
    entries that you will need to resolve from this server, such as the
    following:

       2        IN PTR   &lt;MailServer&gt;.Domain.com.
       3        IN PTR   &lt;FTPServer&gt;.Domain.com.

</PRE><P><LI>When you have completed manually editing the zone files, start the DNS
<P><PRE>    server using one of the following methods:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     - Use the Services tool in Control Panel:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
<PRE></PRE>          double-click the Services icon.

       2. Select Microsoft DNS Server in the Service list and click Start.

       -or-

     - Type the following at a command prompt and press Enter:

          net start dns

</PRE>NOTE: The two ellipses, "...", indicate the unique IP addresses and hosts
between 5 and 254. Ellipses are not valid in the file. In a non-subnetted
class C address file, these records can extend from 1-254, depending on the
number of hosts in the subnet. The 0 address is the network address. The
255 address is considered a broadcast address and is invalid.
<P>
A Classless or Subnetted Reverse Lookup Zone File:
<P>
Assume the class C address has been subnetted into 4 subnets of 64 host
networks, that is, a 255.255.255.192 subnet. This file represents the first

</PRE>The NS record has the 0/26 delegation and each record is a CNAME record
that is associated with a notation such as X.0/26, where X is the unique
IP address. In this in-addr.arpa file, there are no PTR records. Note the
A record underneath the SOA NS. A typical A record is defined for a
host, however, this is the subnet mask of the network. This is a helper
record to identify subnetted delegation.
<P>
ISP Reverse Zone File Supporting Four Domains:
<P>
These files will include the 0/26 delegation as well as the 64/26, 128/26

customers and is assuming a secondary DNS role. There will be 4 separate
files transferred to the ISP, one from each SOA.

</PRE>The subnetted zones are different zones than the network zone. After a
reverse lookup is done, the root servers on the Internet will forward the
request to the ISP for the network zone. The delegations within the network
zone then point to the subnetted NameServers where the reverse lookup takes
place.
<P>
This process requires two reverse lookup zone files for the Microsoft DNS
Server to support classless delegation. The first in-addr.arpa file looks
similar to the non-subnetted file above. It will contain the associated PTR
records for the zone file. Both the original zone and non-subnetted in-
addr.arpa files can be created and edited in Microsoft DNS Manager.
<P>
The second in-addr.arpa file will contain the classless delegation with
CNAME records. It is necessary to manually edit this file.
<P>
NOTE: Because the classless in-addr.arpa is still in draft form, and a
standard has not been agreed upon, there may be implementation differences
between vendors' DNS. Please consult the particular vendor for their
implementation of classless in-addr.arpa delegation.
<P>
For additional information on DNS, please see the following whitepaper
available on the Microsoft anonymous ftp server:
