The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to use the Remote Access Service (RAS) as your
network connection when logging on to a Windows NT domain. This may be
necessary if you do not have access to a Wide Area Network (WAN), but you
are able to dial and connect to a remote network through RAS. The
following topics are discussed:

<UL><LI>How to join a remote domain using RAS
<LI>Creating an account for your RAS client computer on a remote domain
<LI>Connecting to a network using RAS to create a domain list
<P>
</UL>When you create an account for your RAS client computer on a remote
domain, you can be validated by a domain controller on the remote
network. This gives you access to domain resources using the same account
you use when you are connected directly to the network.
<P>

<P><h3>How to Join a Remote Domain Using RAS</h3>
 
<P>
To join a remote domain using RAS, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that your Windows NT-based computer is configured as a member of
   a workgroup and not a domain.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>Click Add Software, and then install RAS.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The next step requires dial-in permissions for your account.

<OL><P><LI>Use RAS to connect to a RAS server on the remote domain.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: When a RAS client tries to connect to a resource on a Windows NT
Workstation-based computer acting as a RAS server, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The logon server could not be found.

</PRE></OL>To work around this issue, configure your workstation to be a member of a
workgroup with the same name as the domain name.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating an Account for Your RAS Client Computer on a Remote Domain</h3>
 
<P>
To create an account for your RAS client computer on a remote domain,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>Click Change, click Domain, and then type the name of the remote domain
   you want to join in the Domain box.

<P><LI>Click the Create Computer Account In Domain check box to select it.

<P><LI>Type the name of a user account (with administrative privileges in the
   domain you are joining) in the User Name box, and then type the
   password for that account in the Password box.

<P><LI>Click OK. If this procedure is successful, the following message
   appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Welcome to the &lt;domain name&gt; domain
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Connecting to a Network Using RAS to Create a Domain List</h3>
 
<P>
To connect to a network using RAS to create a domain list, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Log on to your Windows NT-based computer using a local user account.

<P><LI>Use RAS to connect to a RAS server on the remote domain.

<P><LI>Click Logoff on the Program Manager File menu. Note that your RAS
   connection is maintained when you do this.
<P>
   NOTE: For Windows NT version 4.0 you will need to set the
   KeepRASConnections registry key to keep the RAS connection open when you
   logoff.
<P>
   For additional information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft knowledge Base:

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Keep RAS Connections Active After Logging Off

</PRE><P><LI>Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE, and then log on. The domain list is created
   through the RAS link.

<P><LI>Log on to the remote domain.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: After you have logged on to the remote domain once, your domain
credentials are cached locally. Therefore, you do not have to repeat step
5 when you log onto the remote domain again.
