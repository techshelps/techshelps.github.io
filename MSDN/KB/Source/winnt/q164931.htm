The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
</UL>Although the following article specifically applies to Windows NT 4.0, the
procedure listed herein is the same for Windows 95. The only difference is
that with Windows 95 you will not get the error messages listed at the end
of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The system registry is the central database that Windows NT uses to keep
track of everything related to the proper operation of the operating
system. Being the operating system's central repository, it maintains a
comprehensive listing of all installed hardware and software components.
<P>
It is vital that you maintain backup copies of this part of the operating
system. If some piece of software has modified the registry and, as a
result, the system is no longer functioning as desired, a backup of your
registry files can save hours of troubleshooting and recovery.
<P>
Until the shipment of Windows NT 4.0, the methods available to backup the
registry were:

<UL><LI>Using a tape backup program that allows backing up the registry,
   such as NT Backup.

<LI>Running the RDISK utility included with Windows NT; which gives a
   partial backup, which includes only the Administrator, and Guest
   accounts from the user accounts database.
<P>
</UL>Using the Windows 95 Registry Editor, regedit.exe, and the procedures
described below, you can make an additional copy of the registry and
restore it by double-clicking a single icon.
<P>
Keep in mind that this procedure is not a replacement for running RDISK and
using the Backup Registry option in your tape backup software. It is just
an additional method of safeguarding the most critical part of the
operating system.
<P>
<P><h3>Procedure for Making a Copy of the Registry</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, and then click Run.

<P><LI>When the dialog box appears, type REGEDIT on the Open: line, and then
   click OK.

<P><LI>When the Windows 95 Regedit appears you will notice that "My computer"
   is highlighted.

<P><LI>From the Registry menu, click Export Registry File.

<P><LI>When the Save in: dialog box appears, select the Up Folder Icon until
   Desktop appears in the box.

<P><LI>Type Registry in the File Name: box.

<P><LI>Click Save and exit Regedit.
<P>
</OL>If you perform this procedure prior to any changes on a good working
system, this procedure will save a complete copy of the registry to your
profiles desktop folder. It is a single file that can be double-clicked to
restore the registry back to the conditions that existed at the time it was
saved.
<P>
You can actually place this file anywhere you want, but the desktop is
convenient. No matter where you decide to store the file, you will be able
to select it by clicking the Start button, pointing to Documents and
clicking on Registry once it has been saved.
<P>
If the system will not start, or you cannot log on as a result of registry
corruption, then you will have to run the Emergency Repair Process as
outlined in the online documentation (see chapter 7 Protecting Data in the
Server Concepts and Planning Guide).
<P>
NOTE: During the restore process, you will get two "System Process -
Licensing Violation" errors that can be safely ignored. These errors
report that the system detected tampering with your registered product
type. An OK button is provided so that you may proceed. Click OK on each
of these messages. The last error you will receive is from Registry Editor
stating that it encountered an error writing to the registry. This error
can also be safely ignored and relates to the other two error messages.
Simply click OK to proceed. Restart your system to make the changes take
effect (you will not be prompted to do so).
