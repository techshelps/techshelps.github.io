The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a Windows NT DHCP client is moved to another subnet (without issuing
the ipconfig/release command before moving), the client will request its
previous IP address. Usually this IP address is not valid for usage on the
new subnet.
<P>
When a DHCP server detects that the client requests an IP address that does
not fit for the current subnet, the DHCP server must send a DHCPNAK to the
client (according to RFC1541).
<P>
Some non-rfc compliant DHCP servers do not send this DHCPNAK. Because of
this, the client does not attempt to lease a new IP address on the new
subnet and tries to use its old IP address (see the frame information later
in this article).
<P>
This problem has been experienced only when using a third-party DHCP
server. The Microsoft Windows NT DHCP server does not experience this
behavior.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Per RFC1541, a DHCP server sends a DHCPNAK to a client that requests an IP
address but is not located on the current subnet. According to RFC1541
(page 28):
<P>
<PRE>   In particular, if the previously allocated network address in the
   ciaddr field from the client does not match the network address
   recorded by the server for that client, the server sends a DHCPNAK to
   the client.

</PRE>After receiving a DHCPNAK, the DHCP client will restart the DHCP lease
process by sending DHCPDISCOVER.
<P>
The following packets have been sent:
<P>
The Windows NT DHCP client sent the following request:
