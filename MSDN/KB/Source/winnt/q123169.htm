This article describes Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) event log IDs
4096 through 4134. These events represent informational messages.

<P><h2>Event Log IDs 4096 - 4134</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>Event   Description
-----   -----------

4096    WINS has initialized its log for this invocation.

4097    WINS has initialized properly and is ready.

4098    WINS was terminated by the service controller. WINS will
        gracefully terminate.

4099    WINS is being gracefully terminated by the administrator. The
        address of the administrator is %1.

4100    WINS is being abruptly terminated by the administrator. The
        address of the administrator is %1.

4101    WINS got a Name Request with an invalid opcode. The request is
        being thrown away.

4102    Connection was aborted by the remote client.

4103    There are no records in the Registry for the key.

4104    There are no PULL records.

4105    There are no PUSH records.

4106    The Database of Name to Address Mappings is empty. It could mean
        that a previous invocation of WINS created the database and then
        went down before any registration could be done.

4107    The Database of Owner to Address Mappings is empty. It could
        mean that a previous invocation of WINS created the table and
        then went down before it could add its own entry to it. The WINS
        server went down real fast (i.e. even before all its threads
        could become fully operational.

4108    WINS could not read the InitTimeReplication field of the
        PULL/PUSH key.

4109    WINS could not read the Refresh Interval from the Registry.

4110    WINS could not read the Tombstone Interval from the Registry.

4111    WINS could not read the Verify Interval from the Registry.

4112    WINS could not read the retry count for retrying communication
        with a remote WINS.

4113    WINS could not read the Tombstone Timeout from the Registry

4114    WINS got a packet that has the wrong format (for example, a label
        may be more than 63 octets).

4115    No records meeting the %1 criteria were found in the database.

4116    WINS's Replicator could not find any records in the database. It
        means that there are no active or tombstone records in the
        database. It could be that the records being requested by a
        remote WINS server are either released or non-existent.

4117    The special group has reached its limit. WINS can not add any
        more members.

4118    The address database already has 25 ACTIVE address owners which
        is the maximum. This error was noticed while attempting to add
        the address given below.

4119    The WINS server got an update notification from the WINS server
        with address (%1). The WINS server rejected it. This means that
        the remote WINS server is not in the list of Push partners (WINS
        servers under the PULL key) and the administrator has prohibited
        (via the Registry) replication with non-configured WINS servers.
        If you wish this WINS server to accept update notifications from
        non-configured WINS servers then set "RplOnlyWCnfPnrs" (without
        quotes) value in the Registry to 0. The Registry location is as
        follows:

           HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
           \Wins\Parameters

        NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
        readability.

4120    The WINS got an update notification from WINS with address (%1).
        The WINS accepted it.

4121    The WINS server got a pull request from the WINS  server with
        address (%1). The WINS server rejected it since the remote WINS
        server is not in the list of PULL partners (WINS servers under
        the PUSH key) and the administrator has specified (via the
        Registry) that replication with remote WINS server not in the list
        be not done. If you wish this WINS server to accept update
        notifications from WINS servers not in the "pull partner" list,
        then set the "replication only with configured partners" value
        in the Registry to 0. The Registry location is as follows:

           HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
           \Wins\Parameters

        NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
        readability.

4122    The datafiles key could not be opened.

4123    The NETBT key could not be opened.

4124    The NETBT key could not be queried.

4125    A worker thread was created by the administrator.

4126    A worker thread was terminated by the administrator.

4127    The owner-address mapping table had an entry with owner ID
        non-zero and address the same as the local WINS address. The
        entry has been marked as deleted in the in-memory table.

4128    An exception was encountered while trying to inform a remote WINS
        to update the version number.

4129    The local WINS is going to inform a remote WINS to update the
        version number of a record. This is because the local WINS got a
        clash between an active owned name and an active replica that it
        pulled from a replication partner.

4130    The local WINS has been informed by a remote WINS with address %1
        to update the version number  of a record. This is because the
        remote WINS got a clash between an active owned name and an active
        replica that it pulled from a replication partner.

4131    WINS could not find the record it was asked to update the version
        stamp of (by a remote WINS). Check if the record got deleted or
        updated.

4132    While verifying the validity of old replicas, a name mismatch was
        noticed. The local record has the name %1 while the replica pulled
        in from the WINS that owns this record has the name %2. This could
        mean that the remote WINS was brought down and then up again but
        its version counter value was not set to its previous value before
        termination.

4133    The value of the version counter was changed. The new value (Low
        32 bits) can be viewed under Data in the Event Details dialog box
        in Event Viewer.

4134    WINS replication request is being ignored since WINS suspects that
        the Wins\Partners key information has changed (because it got a
        notification from the Registry) which makes the current request
        pertaining to partner old.
