The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Scopy.exe to copy a directory tree, the following error may
appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Permissions, auditing, and/or owner could not be copied.

</PRE>All of the files are copied correctly, but the directories will inherit the
permissions of the immediate parent directories.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The account that you are using does not have permission at the List level
(or greater) for the directories you are copying.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Currently, the only resolution to this problem is to give at least List
permission to the account of the user running Scopy.exe.
<P>
In addition to List permission, the resource kit documentation states
that Scopy.exe tries to use the following user privileges in these cases:

<UL><LI>Backup Files and Folders, which allows you to copy files when
   your access is normally restricted at the source.

<LI>Restore Files and Folders, which allows you to use the /o switch to
   copy files that are not your own.

<LI>Manage Auditing and the Security Log, which allows you to use the
   /a switch.
<P>
</UL>The resource kit documentation also gives the syntax for Scopy.exe as the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   SCopy &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt; [/o] [/a] [/s] [/?]
   Example: SCopy G:\from\*.* H:\to\ /s

</PRE>This syntax uses the following variables:

<UL><LI>source, which specifies the place from which files will be copied

<LI>destination, which specifies the place to which the files will be copied

<LI>/o, which copies owner security information

<LI>/a, which copies security auditing information

<LI>/s, which copies all files in sub-folders

<LI>/?, which shows all command-line options
<P>
</UL>NOTE: To copy your own files, you do not require any special user
privileges. To use the /o or /a switches, or to copy other users' files to
which you do not ordinarily have access, you must be logged on as a member
of the Administrators group on both the computer where you are copying the
files from and on the computer you are copying files to.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51
and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
