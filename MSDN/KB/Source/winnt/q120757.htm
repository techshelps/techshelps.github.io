<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
When using WINS Manager to administer a remote WINS server, you may notice
that all menu options are enabled except for the Configuration and
Replication Partners options of the Server menu.
<P>
Most WINS Manager commands are performed using IP-to-IP (non-NetBIOS)
connections. However, the Configuration and Replication Partners options
run over RPC which requires NetBIOS sessions (over TCP/IP) to be
established. If the NetBIOS connection fails, these two menu items will
appear disabled. Similarly, attempting to use Registry Editor to remotely
access the computer's Registry will fail because it also relies on an RPC
connection to be established. Once a NetBIOS connection is made, these
options are enabled.
<P>
To fix this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that you are a member of the Administrators or Domain
   Administrators groups and that you are logged in with a proper password.

<P><LI>Verify that you are able to get a "Name to IP" resolution of the name of
   the WINS server you are focused on:
<P>
   a. From the Options menu choose Preferences. Try setting the address
<P><PRE>      display as "Computer Name (IP Address)" and/or "IP Address (Computer
      Name)" and set the focus again on the remote WINS server by selecting
      it from the list of WINS servers.
</PRE><P>
   b. Use the IPCONFIG /ALL command to find the IP addresses of the primary
<P><PRE>      and secondary WINS servers you are consulting. Then enter the IP
      address and name of the remote WINS server as a static mapping into
      the database of the primary and secondary WINS servers you are
      consulting.
</PRE><P>
</OL>NOTE: Verify that all WINS servers are configured with static (not dynamic)
IP Addresses; they should not be DHCP clients.
