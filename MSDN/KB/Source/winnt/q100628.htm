<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The "look and feel" of Windows NT is generally the same as that of
Windows 3.1. Most of the applications were derived from their 16-bit
counterparts and were changed only to reflect new functionality
Windows NT provides. Print Manager is the major exception to this
rule; it was modified from Windows 3.1 to provide cleaner and more
consistent methods to install, administer, and query printers. The
following text lists other major differences between applications:
<P>
<P><h3>Program Manager</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows NT Program Manager introduces the concept of common and
personal groups. A common group is created by an administrator account
when an administrator installs an application. A personal group is
created when a user account installs an application or creates a
group.
<P>
The Program Manager title bar lists the user name and the domain name
to which the user has logged on.
<P>
Other minor differences include: The file menu has log-off and
shutdown options. The Options menu allows the user to save Program
Manager settings immediately rather than waiting until the user logs
off.
<P>
<P><h3>Task Manager</h3>
 
<P>
The Task Manager has a new field, New Task, that enables the user to
quickly start a new application. To start an application in Windows
3.1, you must choose Run from the File menu in File Manager or in
Program Manager.
<P>
<P><h3>File Manager</h3>
 
<P>
File Manager contains a toolbar similar to that of the Windows for
Workgroups File Manager. Because Windows NT has Microsoft Mail and
security built in, these items always appear on the main menu. Also,
the internal workings of File Manager were modified to exploit more
than one thread. File Manager starts a thread to perform a network
query and to format a disk while allowing the user to interact with
the File Manager to perform other tasks simultaneously.
<P>
<P><h3>Print Manager</h3>
 
<P>
All query and manipulation functions related to printers and print
jobs is consolidated into the Print Manager. You can install local or
remote printers, connect printers to ports or network connections,
query print job queues on local and remote printers, and pause,
resume, and delete print jobs and printers. To access the Print
Manager, choose the Printers icon in Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Control Panel</h3>
 
<P>
The Control Panel contains several new icons. For example, the Cursors
icon enables and selects animated cursors. The Ports icon provides
information about the capabilities of serial ports and allows you to
select a higher baud rate if the port supports it. Other icons support
new features in Windows NT such as Devices, Server, Services, and UPS
(uninterruptable power supply).
<P>
<P><h3>Accessories</h3>
 
<P>
The applications in the Program Manager Accessories group are
essentially the same as those in Windows 3.1.
