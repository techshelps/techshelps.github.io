<P><h2>REGISTRY ENTRIES FOR USER PREFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
The information presented here is primarily for troubleshooting, showing
the default entry values and explaining the meaning of important entries.

these values can be set using the icons in Control Panel or the tools in
the Administrative Tools group, or other programs provided with Windows NT.
<P>
All Registry paths shown here are for HKEY_CURRENT_USER, to show how you
can view entries for the currently logged on user. However, most of these
entries also appear in HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT, where changing entries will
change values for the default user profile.
<P>

<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Keyboard

InitialKeyboardIndicators   REG_SZ   Number
</PRE> 
Default: 0
<P>
Specifies initial values for keys. 0 means that NUMLOCK is turned off after

<P>
<PRE>KeyboardDelay   REG_SZ   0 to 3
</PRE> 
Default: 1
<P>
Establishes how much time elapses after you hold down a key before the key
starts to repeat. The values 0 through 3 provide a linear scale from the
smallest delay supported by the keyboard driver to the largest delay.
Typically, 0 represents 250 milliseconds, and 3 represents 1 second, with a
20 percent accuracy.
<P>
<PRE>KeyboardSpeed   REG_SZ   0 to 31
</PRE> 
Default: 31
<P>
Sets how much time elapses between repetitions of a character on the

represents 30 per second.
<P>
The Keyboard Layout key records the user’s preferred layout, which is
loaded and activated by the system when the user logs on. Entries are found
under this Registry path:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Keyboard Layout

</PRE>When the user logs off, the user’s current keyboard layout is stored here.

Default: 00000409 (for standard U.S. English)
<P>
The Keyboard Layout\Substitutes key is empty by default. This subkey
records a mapping between keyboard layout names. The system checks the
user’s Substitutes subkey when loading the keyboard driver, and if a
substitute is specified, the corresponding layout name is substituted. For
example, an entry such as the following under the Keyboard
Layout\Substitutes subkey indicates that the user prefers the Dvorak U.S.
English keyboard layout (00010409) to the standard U.S. English keyboard
layout (00000409).
<P>
<P><h3>00000409 : REG_SZ : 00010409</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h2>MOUSE ENTRIES FOR USERS</h2>
 
<P>
To change these entries, choose the Mouse icon from Control Panel.
<P>
<PRE>DoubleClickSpeed   REG_SZ   milliseconds
</PRE> 
Default: 686
<P>
Sets the maximum time between clicks of the mouse button that the system
permits for one double-click. The lower the value for this entry, the less
time you have to click twice to double-click.
<P>
<PRE>MouseSpeed   REG_SZ   0 or 1 or 2
</PRE> 
Default: 1
<P>
Sets the relationship between mouse and cursor movement when the value of
either MouseThreshold1 or MouseThreshold2 is exceeded. When this occurs,
cursor movement accelerates according to the value of MouseSpeed.
<P>
<PRE>Value      Meaning
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>0          No acceleration
1          The cursor is moved twice the normal speed when mouse movement
           exceeds the value of MouseThreshold1
2          The cursor is moved twice the normal speed when the mouse
           movementexceeds the value of MouseThreshold1, or four times the
           normal speed if mouse movement exceeds MouseThreshold2.


MouseThreshold1   REG_SZ   pixels
MouseThreshold2   REG_SZ   pixels
</PRE> 
<PRE>Default:          MouseThreshold1=6
                  MouseThreshold2=10

</PRE>These entries set the maximum number of pixels that the mouse can move
between mouse interrupts before the system alters the relationship between
mouse and cursor movement. If the mouse movement exceeds the threshold
defined by MouseThreshold1 and if MouseSpeed is greater than 0, the system
moves the cursor at twice the normal speed. If the mouse movement exceeds
the threshold defined by MouseThreshold2 and if MouseSpeed is 2, the system
moves the cursor at four times the normal speed.
<P>
<PRE>SwapMouseButtons   REG_SZ   Boolean
</PRE> 
Default: 0
<P>
Specifies whether to swap the right and left mouse buttons. If the value is
1, the buttons are swapped.

<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel

</PRE>The informtaion here is for troubleshooting reference. All changes should
be made using the Devices, Drivers, MIDI Mapper, and Sound icons in Control
Panel. The following lists the default entries. All are REG_SZ data types.
