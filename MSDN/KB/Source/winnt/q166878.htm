IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how you can reduce the number of NetBIOS broadcasts
issued by NWLinkNetBIOS (over the IPX\SPX Compatible Transport).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are three registry entries that, if manipulated correctly, can reduce
the number of NetBIOS broadcasts you are seeing from Windows NT
Workstations and Windows NT Server computers. The long-range affect of this
has not been tested. Whether this will have an adverse affect on the domain
and browsing is not known at this time. These registry entries can be found
in the Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit on page 510. These registry entries are
located under
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NWlnkNB
   \Parameters (The book says NWNBLink, this is incorrect).

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

</PRE>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Not that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
The first of these entries is:
<P>
<PRE>   BroadcastCount:REG_DWORD: 1 - 65535
   Specifies the number of times to send a broadcast. If Internet
   is set to 1, the BroadcastCount is doubled.
   Default: 3 (no entry = default)

</PRE>This entry, as its name implies, determines the number of times a NetBIOS
name query is sent out. When you attempt to connect to another computer
through File Manager, Explorer, or a Net Use, this determines how many
times Windows NT will send out a broadcast in an attempt to locate that
particular computer. Changing this entry will change the number of
broadcasts sent out in that query. This affects workgroup announcements and
local master announcements in the same way.
<P>
This setting will not affect the &lt;01&gt;&lt;02&gt;_MSBROWSE_&lt;02&gt;&lt;01&gt; announcements
you might see. That announcement is used by Master Browsers when their
browse list is empty. It prompts all Master Browsers to announce themselves
so that the Master Browser that sent the Find Name out can fill its browse
list.
<P>
NOTE: The more workgroups and domains you have, the more of these
&lt;01&gt;&lt;02&gt;_MSBROWSE_&lt;02&gt;&lt;01&gt; you will see along with workgroup announcements.
You will see most announcements after a computer has been restarted. These
will taper off to regular announcement intervals of every 12-15 minutes.
<P>
<PRE>   The second of these entries is:

   BroadcastTimeout:REG_DWORD: 1 - 65535 half-seconds
   Specifies the time between sending find-name requests. This value
   is not affected if Internet is set to 1.
   Default: 1 (no entry = default)

</PRE>This entry is exactly as it sounds. If BroadcastCount is set to 3 and
BroadcastTimeout is set to 1, you will get 3 broadcasts at approximately
half-second intervals. Making this number larger will increase the time
between broadcasts.
<P>
<PRE>   The third of these entries is:

   Internet:REG_DWORD: 0 or 1
   Specifies whether to change the packet type from 0x04 to 0x14
   (Novell WAN Broadcast).
   Default: 1 (true; no entry = default)

</PRE>This entry causes all find-name broadcasts to go out as Type 0x04 or Type
0x14. Type 0x04 broadcasts will not be forwarded across routers. This has
the same effect as turning off Type 20 broadcasts at the routers, which
will disable browsing and connecting across the routers.
<P>
Browser announcements over an IPX host link are broadcast using a WAN
broadcast because the browser component requests a 0x14 packet type.
Setting Internet under the NWLNKNB registry key to 0 only affects the
NetBIOS broadcasts. Even if the Internet entry in the registry is set to 0
(use packet type 0x04), Windows NT propagates a few type 0x14 frames. This
is necessary for support for some applications that may require it.
