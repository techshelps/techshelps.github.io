The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0
   - Microsoft Cluster Server
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) version 1.0 is included with the Microsoft
Windows NT Server Enterprise Edition version 4.0.
<P>
While MSCS is designed to allow a system administrator to connect two
servers in a high-availability cluster, it can also be used on a single
server to provide multiple "virtual servers" with minimal configuration
required.
<P>
Each virtual server will have its own name and unique IP address. This can
be useful if migrating several servers onto one new server.
<P>
NOTE: MSCS does not support IPX or NetBEUI protocols.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To install MSCS, you must have more than one disk controller. At least one
controller must be SCSI, and that controller cannot have the boot device
attached to it.
<P>
A disk attached to this controller will act as the MSCS shared Quorum disk,
which is where MSCS keeps the data needed to failover a cluster. Note that
using only one system does not provide a mechanism to actually failover,
and the system is not considered highly-available.
<P>
To install MSCS, follow the instructions in the MSCS Administrators Guide
on how to install the first node of a cluster. After MSCS is installed, you
can create cluster Groups using the Cluster Administrator. Within each
group, create an IP resource with the IP address of this virtual server.
Also create a Network Name resource with the name that you want to give to
the virtual server. Make this resource depend on the IP address that was
just created.
<P>
On the network, the server will respond to its main node name, and will
also respond to the names created in any cluster groups. Any shares or
applications will be available to clients connecting with any configured
name.
<P>
You can also create other resources in the groups, and MSCS will restart
the resources if they fail. For more information on creating resources and
groups, consult the MSCS Administrators Guide.
