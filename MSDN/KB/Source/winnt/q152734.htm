<P><h2>HOW TO INSTALL THE SERVICE PACK</h2>
 
<P>
To install the Service Pack, download the file for your hardware platform
to a folder on your hard disk and then type the name of the self-
extracting file. This process decompresses the files to a temporary folder
off the %temp% environment variable, installs the Service Pack, and then
removes the decompressed files and temporary folder. For example, to
install Nt4sp3_i.exe, type the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   nt4sp3_i

</PRE>If you prefer to extract the Service Pack without installing it at the
same time, download the self-extracting file to a folder on your hard disk
and then type the name of the self-extracting file with a /x switch after
it. This process prompts you for a destination folder and then extracts
the files to this folder. For example, to extract Nt4sp3_i.exe, type the
following command:
<P>
<PRE>   nt4sp3_i /x

</PRE>NOTE: After using the /x switch, run Update.exe to install the updated
files. For a list of switches supported by Update.exe, type the following
command:
<P>
<PRE>   update /?

</PRE>To install Symbols, download the self-extracting file to a folder on your
hard disk and type the name of the self-extracting file. For example, to
decompress Nt4sym3i.exe, type the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   nt4sym3i
