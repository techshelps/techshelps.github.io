<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you have Micron Powerstation or Powerserver with Buslogic's BT-946C
SCSI controller, Windows NT setup may hang without an error message while
attempting to load Windows NT to complete the graphic portion of Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
According to Micron and Buslogic these steps usually solve the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Press CTRL-B to go to Buslogic Auto Configuration.

<P><LI>Select Configure Device Menu.

<P><LI>Select Disconnection Option.

<P><LI>Set "Disconnection on all ID's except 0 and 1" to YES.

<P><LI>If these were already set this way you may need to toggle them,
   because some hard drives do not support disconnection.
<P>
</OL>Buslogic Product Support does not recommend permanently changing the
controller configuration as indicated above unless there is only one SCSI
device attached to the controller. The procedure may disable the
functionality of SCSI devices on the SCSI chain during certain I/O actions
carried out by the OS.
<P>
If there are no scanning devices on this chain it is possible to Disable
the SCAN MODE option, since this can cause problems with the installation
of NT, according to Buslogic.
<P>
If this does not solve the problem, go to the Buslogic Auto Configuration
and verify that the IRQ pin is set to pin A (the default) on the
Powerstations and Powerservers. On P90 models this should be set to pin C
(the default); the adapter is installed next to the power supply. Then
verify that the IRQ being used is set to 15 and that in the "Advanced
Options" the BIOS is set to use 4D8.
<P>
Additionally Buslogic BIOS should be flashed to the most recent version
(1.40E as of 9/4/96) since this solves most setup or operational problems
related to NT 3.51 and NT 4.0.
<P>
These steps solve most of the setup hang problems with Windows NT. You can
get more assistance by contacting the vendors listed below:
