<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Batch files can be used to remotely add user accounts to local groups on
all computers running Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation in a
domain environment.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This article demonstrates how to create a batch file system that will add a
user to all local administrators groups located on every computer running
Windows NT Server and Workstation within a domain environment.
<P>
The batch file system uses Netdom.exe from the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit
to create a list of computers running Windows NT that are operating as
member servers or workstations in a domain. After the list is created, each
computer from the list is pinged to determine if the computer is currently
online. If the computer is online, Addusers.exe will be called to place a
new user in the computer's local administrators group. If a computer was
online, its name will be placed in a temporary file. After all computers
have been processed, the temporary file will be compared to the list of
computers from the domain, to create a new list of computers that have not
yet been updated. This batch file system can be run multiple times to
target only the computers that still need to be processed.
<P>
To create these batch files, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create the following batch files from the listing below:
<P>
<P><PRE>      INSUSER.BAT, SUB1.BAT, SUB2.BAT, SUB3.BAT, SUB4.BAT,
      SUB5.BAT, and ADDUSERS.DAT.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Edit the first line of INSUSER.BAT to reflect the domain name where the
   target computers are located.

<P><LI>Change the &lt;domain\user&gt; in the second line in Addusers.dat to reflect
   the name of the user you wish to add to each computer's local
   administrators group. Make sure there are no blank lines at the top of
   the Addusers.dat file.

<P><LI>Log on into the network with domain administrator credentials for the
   domain you wish to modify. Make sure the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit has
   been installed, and is accessible through the system path. This system
   uses Netdom.exe and Addusers.exe from the resource kit.

<P><LI>Cary out the INSUSER.BAT. This batch file may take many hours
   to complete.

<P><LI>Examine the contents of Complete.txt and Working.txt. The Complete.txt
   file contains the names of the computers that were updated, the
   Working.txt file contains the names of the computers that still need
   processing.
<P>
</OL>Repeat Steps 5 &amp; 6 as necessary.
<P>
If you need start the entire process over from scratch, delete all .txt
Files, then start at Step 1.
