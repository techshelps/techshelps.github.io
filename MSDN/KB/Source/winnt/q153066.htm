<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a connection is made to a Windows NT 3.51 server to which the user
has had no prior connection, a connection is made to IPC$ as well as to
the share. After disconnecting from the share, the connection to IPC$
remains, as can be seen in Server Manager under Shares. This may cause
concerns for administrators, who may feel that the connection and any
credentials associated with the user who made the connection might be
accessible by someone else using the same computer.
<P>
For instance, one company reported the following situation. Administrators
needed to connect to the server from a computer that a user had already
logged on to. The administrator used CONNECT AS to make a connection to
the server, downloaded some files, then disconnected. They noticed that
the IPC$ connection was still there in Server Manager. Their concern was
then that the user at that computer might be able to access the server
over that connection with administrator access.
<P>
Additionally, the IPC$ connection is counted by License Manager. As long
as the IPC$ connection is valid, it takes up a license, perhaps preventing
other users from connecting to a resource.
<P>
This connection will drop off when autodisconnect runs (after 15 minutes
of inactivity by default).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This does not pose a security concern, as explained below (under MORE
INFORMATION). However, license counts by License Manager are a valid
concern. One instant solution is to turn off the License Logging service,
using the Services tool in Control Panel.
<P>
The problem has been corrected in Windows NT 4.0. The IPC$ connection is
dropped immediately after user validation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Server Manager will show the connection user as the user's name while the
share connection is maintained. If the user disconnects from the share,
then the IPC$ connection user will change to the user's computer name. At
this point, any user at that computer attempting to connect will have to
authenticate with the server. Although the IPC$ connection is still
intact, it is not associated with any user name or credentials, so it does
not pose a security risk.
