<P>
<P><h3>Error 0000001E</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
What should I do about error 0001E?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
This error is caused by an exception error that is not handled at any
level. It generally refers to a file system problem. Run CHKDSK or
another similar utility on the drive in question. If your hardware is
on the hardware compatibility list, please submit a bug report.
<P>
<P><h3>NTVDM Error</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
When I run MS-DOS or Windows 3.1 applications, I receive the following
error message. Why?
<P>
<PRE>   Insufficient memory or Disk Error in NTVDM or NTVDM Error's.

</PRE>Answer:
<P>
Try the following:

<UL><LI>Increase the page file size to at least 20MB.
<LI>Make sure the video card is on the hardware compatibility list
   (1193HW.DOC). If it is not, try using the standard VGA driver.
<LI>Verify that the WOWEXEC.EXE is not corrupted by copying over a
   clean copy.
<P>
</UL><h3>Error 0x00000069 or 0x00000067</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
I get Error 0x00000069. What should I do?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
This is an initialization error that occurs when Windows NT tries to
talk with the hard drive controller. It can be caused by many things.
Try the following work arounds:

<UL><LI>Slow down the DMA transfer rate on the controller.

<LI>Make sure both ends of the SCSI bus are terminated.

<LI>Make sure there are no IRQ, or memory address conflicts.

<LI>Make sure you are not using a faulty or unsupported driver.

<LI>Make sure NTDETECT.COM is in the root of the boot drive partition.
   Missing Windows NT files can also cause Error 69.
<P>
</UL><h3>System Error F002</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
What is System Error F002?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
System Error F002 is usually generated when there is a faulty piece of
hardware, like a bad memory chip. It can also be caused by a hardware
incompatibility caused by one of the following:

<UL><LI>Memory parity errors
<LI>Adapter asserting an I/O channel check on the bus, (VGA or network
   cards)
<LI>Math coprocessor error
<P>
</UL>If any of these occur, run your computer manufacturer's system
diagnostic utilities.
<P>
<P><h3>Setup Fails with SCSI Read Request Error</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Why do I get the following error during Windows NT Setup:
<P>
<PRE>     SCSI read request failed Arc status 8 Srb status 0084

</PRE>Answer:
<P>
AutoCheck is unable to resolve file system or FAT problems on the
drive. Run a diagnostic utility such as CHKDSK on the file system and
fix any problems you find. Afterwards, reinstall Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h3>LogErrorEntry Error (UniqueId=300)</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
What should I do about a LogErrorEntry error with UniqueId 300?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
If you receive the following error during the installation of Windows
NT on a machine with an Adaptec 1542b card, remove the BUSLOGIC.SYS
file from the Setup disk and reinstall.
<P>
<PRE>     LogErrorEntry: logging SCSI error packet. ErrorCode=Internal
     adapter error.  PathId=0,TargetID=0,Lun=0,UniqueId=300.
</PRE>
