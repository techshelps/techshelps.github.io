The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows NT Server Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
database will not delete entries owned by other WINS servers that are no
longer functioning. A registry entry, PersonaNonGrata, can be used to
remove entries that are owned by other WINS servers that are no longer a
part of the WINS replication network.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In a Microsoft Windows NT network with multiple WINS servers, entries
owned by WINS servers that are no longer part of the network of replicated
databases will be replicated indefinitely. This is because WINS
must check with an owner server before entries are deleted. If a WINS
server is no longer in use, other WINS servers will err on the side of
caution and keep records they cannot verify as expired on an owner server.
Even if an owner is deleted in WINS Manager, these unwanted entries will
continue to be replicated from other WINS servers.
<P>
The Windows NT registry value PersonaNonGrata allows an administrator to
specify the IP addresses of owner servers of unwanted records.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry
Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys
And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit
it.
<P>
The PersonaNonGrata is not in the registry by default, it must be added
manually. Perform the following steps to add this entry to the registry:

<OL><P><LI>Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Go to the following key in the registry:
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WINS\Partners

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, click Add Value and type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: PersonaNonGrata
      Data Type:  REG_MULTI_SZ
<PRE></PRE>      Value:      IP address of non-existent WINS server that is the owner
                  server of the unwanted records being replicated.
      Default:    (None)

      NOTE: This entry does not go in either the Push or Pull subkey of
            Partners, but is entered as a value in Partners along with the
            Push and Pull Subkeys. After entering the value, stop and re-
            start the WINS service to enable the value.

</PRE></OL>When a server is given PersonaNonGrata status, it can be deleted as an
owner in WINS Manager (Mappings-Show Database), and its entries will not
be replicated from other servers.
