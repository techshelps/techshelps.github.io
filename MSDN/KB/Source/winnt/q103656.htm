The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
Many different 16-bit applications designed to run under Windows 3.1
have been tested with Windows NT. When you are troubleshooting a
16-bit Windows-based application that is not working properly under
Windows NT, the following items should be taken into consideration:

<UL><LI>If possible, verify that the application works correctly under
   Windows 3.0 and 3.1.

<LI>If the application requires a VxD (virtual device driver), it will
   not work properly under Windows NT.

<LI>If the application requires Windows 3.0 or 3.1 to be running in 386
   enhanced mode, the application will not function properly on either
   the DEC Alpha or MIPS versions of Windows NT at this time because
   these platforms currently emulate only the Intel 80286
   architecture.

<LI>Check Print Manager to see that a default printer has been
   selected. Some applications (such as Microsoft Word version 2.0 for
   Windows) will not function properly under Windows NT unless a
   default printer has been selected.

<LI>Make sure that any dynamic link libraries (DLLs) used by the
   application are both current and locatable by the application
   (either on the system path or explicitly defined within the
   application or working directory.)

<LI>Make sure that the default items in the CONFIG.NT and AUTOEXEC.NT
   files are present and in the proper order.
<P>
   In Windows NT 3.1, CONFIG.NT contains the following commands by
   default:
<P>
<P><PRE>      files=50
      lastdrive=k
      fcbs=4,0
      dos=high, umb
      device=%SystemRoot%\system32\himem.sys
</PRE><P>
   In Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0, the CONFIG.NT contains the following
   commands by default:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dos=high, umb
      device=%SystemRoot%\system32\himem.sys
      files=20
</PRE><P>
   AUTOEXEC.NT contains the following commands by default:
<P>
<P><PRE>      @echo off
      lh %SystemRoot%\system32\mscdexnt.exe
      lh %SystemRoot%\system32\redir
      lh %SystemRoot%\system32\dosx
</PRE>
<LI>Any environment variables required by the Windows-based application
   should be in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file; if they are, Windows NT will
   use them appropriately.
<P>
   Note that if any changes are made to variables related to the
   Windows 3.0 or 3.1 subsystem (WOWEXEC.EXE), the user may have to
   restart the computer in order for these changes to be implemented.

<LI>Determine whether Windows NT has been installed as a stand-alone
   operating system or as an upgrade of a previous Windows 3.0 or 3.1
   installation. If it is an upgrade, information from the WIN.INI
   and/or SYSTEM.INI files may have not been correctly copied into the
   Windows NT Registry database.
<P>
   To correct this problem, you may have to either migrate these
   settings again, or reinstall the application that is not working.
<P>
   For help with migrating application information into the Windows NT
   Registry, query on the following reference words in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      migrate and WIN.INI
</PRE>
<LI>Try running the application in a separate memory space by editing the
   icon or shortcut’s properties and checking the appropriate checkbox.
