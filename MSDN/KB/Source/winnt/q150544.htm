The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
The following information describes the general properties and maintenance
activities performed on Microsoft DHCP scopes.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The subnet identifiers and address pool make up the properties of scopes.
You can change the properties of an existing scope by selecting the scope
for which you want to change properties and then clicking Properties on the
Scope menu. You can also double-click the scope to access its properties.
<P>
<P><h3>Modifying a Scope</h3>
 
<P>
After a scope has been created, you can extend the address range of the
scope, but you cannot reduce it.
<P>
<P><h3>Removing a Scope</h3>
 
<P>
No leases can be active when a user wants to remove a scope. This task can
be accomplished by deactivating the scope until all client leases expire or
all client lease extension requests are denied. Once there are no more
active leases contained in the scope, you can remove the scope by selecting
the scope under DHCP Servers and choosing Delete on the Scope menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Add Reservations</h3>
 
<P>
You can configure DHCP so that a DHCP server always assigns the same IP
address to a client. This is called a client reservation. This may be
necessary because you may need to assign a DHCP client the same IP address
every time it makes a request.
<P>
To configure a reservation, select the Scope under DHCP Servers and choose
Add Reservations on the Scope menu. Type the appropriate IP address and the
Unique Identifier/MAC address of the client. The unique identifier can be
displayed by typing NET CONFIG RDR or IPCONFIG /ALL (WINIPCFG on Windows
95) from a command prompt.
<P>
One advantage of a reservation over an exclusion is that with a
reservation, the clients can still be administered using the Active Leases
option on the Scope menu. If you statically assign an address and exclude
it from the scope, the client will not show up in the Active Leases list.
<P>
In addition, a reservation still requires that the client register with the
DHCP server. This forces the client to accept the DHCP options that may be
configured for the subnet. An exclusion will NOT receive DHCP options for
that scope dynamically; they must be hardcoded on the client.
<P>
<P><h3>Active Leases</h3>
 
<P>
The Active Leases option allows a graphical display of current leased IPs
as well as client reservation. If the computer symbol includes a phone, it
is a lease owned by the RAS service (NDISWANx wrapper).
<P>
Although a client lease can be deleted from within this graphical display,
the client may still receive the same address following an IPCONFIG /RENEW
command because the client also has a copy of its address information
locally. Until a client receives a different address or a negative
acknowledgment (NACK) for a request to have the same address, it will ask
for the same IP.
