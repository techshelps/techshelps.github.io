The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following errors may occur in Windows NT when connecting to a Windows
NT Workstation or a member Windows NT Server computer with User Manager or
Server Manager:
<P>
<PRE>   The trust relationship between this workstation and the domain failed.

</PRE>Additionally, the following 5770 and 5722 errors may occur in the event log
on a primary domain controller:
<P>
Netlogon Event ID 5722:
<P>
<PRE>   The session setup from the computer CSWINS failed to authenticate. The
   name of the account referenced in the security database is CSWINS$. The
   following error occurred:

      Access is denied.

</PRE>Netlogon Event ID 5770:
<P>
<PRE>   The session setup to the Windows NT Domain Controller &lt;\\server&gt; from
   computer CSWINS using account CSWINS$ failed. CSWINS2 is declared to be
   a BDC in domain &lt;domain_name&gt;. However, CSWINS2 tried to connect as
   either a DC in a trusted domain, a member workstation in domain
   &lt;domain_name&gt;, or as a server in domain &lt;domain_name&gt;. Use the Server
   Manager to remove the BDC account for CSWINS.

</PRE>And the following errors will occur on the target workstation or member
server:
<P>
Netlogon Event ID 5719:
<P>
<PRE>   No Windows NT Domain Controller is available for domain &lt;domain_name&gt;.
   The following error occurred:

   There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon
   request.

   NOTE: This event is expected and can be ignored when booting with the No
   Net Hardware Profile.

</PRE>Netlogon Event ID 3210:
<P>
<PRE>   Failed to authenticate with &lt;\\server&gt;, a Windows NT domain controller
   for domain &lt;domain_name&gt;.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Workstation and stand-alone server computer accounts are mistakenly treated
as LanMan backup domain controllers (BDC) by the primary domain controller
(PDC). LanMan BDCs are declared as such in a Windows NT domain by creating
a special Windows NT global group called servers, creating user accounts
that correspond to the computer names of the LanMan BDCs, and placing
those user accounts in the servers group.
<P>
Authentication with the PDC fails when the accounts in the servers group
are actually Windows NT workstations and servers. This is because Windows
NT will use the secure channel account password against to authenticate
with the PDC. The PDC finds a matching user account in the servers group
for the Windows NT system and treats it as a LanMan BDC. During
challenge/response authentication, the PDC uses the user account password
instead of the secure channel password to authenticate the Windows NT
system. This causes the errors noted in the summary.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If no LanMan BDCs exist, then remove the servers group and restart the
Netlogon service on the PDC.
<P>
If LanMan BDCs exist, then remove the user accounts for the Windows NT
systems experiencing this problem from the servers group. Restart the
Netlogon service on the PDC.
