The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a user at a computer running Windows NT attempts to connect to a
Windows NT Workstation system that already has ten users connected to it,
the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   No more connections can be made to this remote computer at this time
   because there are already as many connections as the computer can
   accept.

</PRE>When an eleventh user at a Windows for Workgroups version 3.x system
attempts to connect to a Windows NT Workstation system that already has ten
users connected to it, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 71. The network request was not accepted.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Ten is the maximum number of other computers that are permitted to
simultaneously connect over the network to Windows NT Workstation 3.5,
3.51, and 4.0. This limit includes all transports and resource sharing
protocols combined.
<P>
This limit is the number of simultaneous sessions from other computers the
system is permitted to host. This limit does not apply to the use of
administrative tools that attach to the system from a remote computer.
<P>
NOTE: This limitation only applies to inbound connections to Windows NT
Workstation 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0. When you use Windows NT Workstation 3.5,
3.51, and 4.0, unlimited connections (outbound connections) can be
established to other systems.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Any file, print, named pipe, or mail slot session that does not have any
activity on it will be automatically disconnected after the AutoDisconnect
time has expired; the default for this is 15 minutes. Once the session is
disconnected, one of the 10 connections will be available so that another
user can connect to the Windows NT Workstation system. Therefore, lowering
the AutoDisconnect time can help to reduce some of the problems users may
encounter with the 10-connection limit on a system that is not used heavily
for server purposes.
<P>
You can configure the AutoDisconnect time by running the following command
from a command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   net config server /autodisconnect:&lt;time_before_autodisconnect&gt;

</PRE>Specify the time in minutes.
<P>
NOTE: The Windows NT Server service is self-tuning, normally the server
configuration parameters are auto-configured (calculated and set) each time
you boot Windows NT. If you run NET CONFIG SERVER in conjunction with the
/AUTODISCONNECT, /SERVCOMMENT or /HIDDEN switches, the current values for
the automatically tuned parameters are displayed and written to the
registry. Once these parameters are written to the registry, you cannot
tune the Server service using Control Panel Networks. If you changed any of
the Server service settings, Windows NT is no longer able to automatically
tune the Server service for your new configuration. To avoid losing the
Server service's auto self-tuning capability, make the change through
registry editor instead from a command line or Control Panel Network.
<P>

base:

   TITLE     : How the Autodisconnect Works in Windows NT

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
All logical drive, logical printer, and transport level connections
combined from a single computer are considered to be one session;
therefore, these connections only count as one connection in the 10-
connection limit. For example, if a user establishes two logical drive
connections, two Windows sockets, and one logical printer connection to a
Windows NT Workstation system, one session is established. As a result,
there will be only one less connection that can be made to the Windows NT
Workstation system, even though three logical connections have been
established.
<P>
The only way system A will have multiple sessions to another system, system
Z, is if system A is running services that create logical connections to
system Z. For example, if a user is logged on to system A as guest and a
service is running on system A under the user1 account, and both the user
and the service (as user1) establish connections to system Z, two sessions
will be established. Each logon session that uses the Server service counts
against the connection limit.
