The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you restart your computer, you may receive one of the following error
messages:

<UL><LI>STOP: 0x0000007B Inaccessible Boot Device

<LI>Setup has encountered a fatal error that prevents it from continuing.
   Contact your software representative for help. The following status
   codes will assist them "0x4, 0, 0, 0"
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if one or more of the following conditions exists:

<OL><P><LI>Your computer is infected with a boot sector virus.

<P><LI>A device driver required by your boot controller is not configured to
   start at boot time or is corrupt. If during a WINNT /B installation
   no mass storage device was detected.

<P><LI>A resource conflict exists between the boot controller and another
   controller in the system or between SCSI devices.

<P><LI>Drive translation is not being performed or was changed.

<P><LI>The boot volume is corrupt and cannot be mounted by Windows NT.

<P><LI>Information in the Windows NT registry about which device drivers load
   at start up is corrupt.

<P><LI>If this error occurred during Windows NT Setup while reading Windows NT
   Setup floppy disk 2, you may have the Drive Swapping option enabled in
   your computer BIOS.

<P><LI>Using winnt /b as the installation method may present a timing issue for
   the disk controller.  The controller is not given enough time to respond
   and identify itself and is therefore detected incorrectly or not at all.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, use the appropriate method:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Check any diskettes for viruses that may have been used in the computer
since the last time you were able to successfully restart Windows NT.
<P>
NOTE: You may need to use more than one brand of virus detection software
to detect and remove various viruses.
<P>
If a virus has infected the Windows NT computer and a virus detection
program cannot remove the virus and repair the system, you will have to
reinstall Windows NT. For more information on how to protect the boot
sector from viruses in Windows NT, see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How to Protect Boot Sector from Viruses in Windows NT



</PRE></OL><h3>SOLUTION 2</h3>
 
<P>
Windows NT requires a mini-port driver to communicate with the boot
controller. If the device driver is corrupt or incompatible with your
controller, you can replace it by copying a new drive to the
%systemroot%\system32\drivers folder or through the Emergency Repair
process. On computers running on a SCSI controller or ATAPI enabled
systems, SCSIPORT.SYS and DISK.SYS (Windows NT 4.0 only) device drivers
are also required to successfully boot.
<P>
If you attempt a "WINNT /B" installation, you may receive a STOP 0x7B
before mass storage detection takes place. To work around this, when the
computer reboots after the initial file copy, press F6 as soon as "Setup
is
inspecting your computers hardware configuration" is displayed. This
will allow you to add a mass storage device at the very beginning of text
mode setup.

   TITLE     : Replacing System Files Using a Modified Emergency Repair
               Disk

</PRE><h3>SOLUTION 3</h3>
 
<P>
If an IRQ or I/O port address conflict exists between your boot controller
and another controller in the system, Windows NT will either hang or stop
with the Stop 0x0000007B error message. If you recently added new
hardware, remove the new hardware or re-configure it so it does not
conflict with the resources of any other installed controllers.
<P>
Check the SCSI chain for proper termination. Remove any non-essential SCSI
devices or check to ensure each SCSI ID is unique.

</PRE><h3>SOLUTION 4</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows NT Boot partition must exist within the first 1024 cylinders
of the boot device. This is due to restrictions of the INT-13 BIOS call
used to start the operating system. Check your CMOS settings for LBA
support on IDE based systems, or your SCSI controllers BIOS settings for
enabling drive translation for drives greater than 2GB.

   TITLE     : Windows NT Boot Process and Hard Disk Constraints


</PRE><h3>SOLUTION 5</h3>
 
<P>
If the file system is corrupt and Windows NT cannot mount the boot volume
during start, move the drive to another machine running Windows NT and run
the CHKDSK command on that drive. Alternately, attempt to create a
parallel installation of Windows NT on the drive in a separate directory.
The Windows NT Setup program checks the integrity of the volume prior to
copying files and may fix some problems.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>SOLUTION 6</h3>
 
<P>
If the SYSTEM Hive in the Windows NT registry is corrupt, it may prevent
Windows NT from loading the Mini-port device driver required by the boot
controller. To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Start from the three Windows NT setup disks and use the Repair utility.
   When prompted, select to inspect registry files, and then only replace
   the System Configuration Registry hive. This hive contains information
   about which device drivers and services start during start up.

<LI>Install a parallel copy of Windows NT into a separate directory, and
   then use Registry Editor to modify the System hive in the Windows NT
   registry to correct the invalid or missing information.

</PRE></UL><h3>SOLUTION 7</h3>
 
<P>
Many computers are equipped with a 5.25-inch and a 3.5-inch floppy
diskette drive in one single unit. When you install Windows NT on a
computer with this floppy drive unit, the STOP 0x7B error message may
appear during Setup while Windows NT Setup disk 2 is being read. To
resolve this problem, disable the Drive Swapping option in your system
BIOS. For information about correcting this problem, see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
