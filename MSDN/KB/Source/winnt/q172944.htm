The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0
   - Microsoft Cluster Server
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) maintains details about changes within the
cluster by means of a quorum log file. The file is located on the disk
designated as the quorum disk. When the node that owns the quorum disk
fails, the surviving nodes arbitrate to take ownership of the device. In a
single cluster, there can only be one quorum disk. If the device fails, it
may be necessary to designate another device as the quorum disk.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The quorum disk is located on a shared SCSI bus within the cluster. If the
device cannot be brought online, the Cluster service cannot start. To
resolve this situation, resolve the problem preventing the device from
operating properly, or designate another disk as the quorum device. This
may also be a replacement drive.
<P>
Use the following procedure to help recover from this situation:

<OL><P><LI>If the Cluster service is running, use Control Panel on both nodes to
   stop the Cluster service.

<P><LI>On one node, use the Services tool in the Control Panel to specify
   "-fixquorum" as the startup parameter for the Cluster service and start
   the service.

<P><LI>In Cluster Administrator, right-click the cluster, and then click
   Properties.

<P><LI>Select the Quorum tab, select a different quorum resource, and then
   click OK. If you are replacing or adding a disk for this purpose, add
   the necessary storage resource for this device and make sure it is
   online first.

<P><LI>In Services, stop the Cluster service, and then start the Cluster
   service without startup parameters. After the service starts, you may
   start the service on the other node.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Use of the fixquorum option causes activity with the quorum disk to
be disabled -- including quorum logging. When you disable quorum logging
within a cluster, changes to the cluster configuration cannot be logged. If
a node goes offline during this period, recent changes may be lost if
changes could not be communicated to the other node. Quorum logging should
only be disabled when necessary to recover from log file corruption. This
option is intended for temporary use only.
