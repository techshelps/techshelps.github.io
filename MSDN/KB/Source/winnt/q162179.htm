<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
TCP performance on lossy networks has been improved in Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 2. Support was added for the Van Jacobson TCP fast retransmit
and recovery algorithm.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For an excellent description of fast retransmit and recovery, see "TCP/IP
Illustrated, Volume 1," Richard Stevens, page 312, Addison-Wesley, 1994. A
summary of behavior before and after you apply Service Pack 2 is presented.
<P>
(Assume a receive window size that allows 6 full-sized Ethernet frames to
be sent without waiting for acknowledgment.)
<P>
<P><h3>Before Service Pack 2</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Sender     Receiver
   -------------------
   packet1 -&gt;
   packet2 -&gt;
              &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
   packet3 -&gt; (assume this packet is lost)
   packet4 -&gt;
              &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
   packet5 -&gt;
              &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
   packet6 -&gt;
              &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
   packet7 -&gt;
              &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
   packet8 -&gt;
              &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
   pause, for retransmission timeout of packet 3 data
   packet3 -&gt;
              &lt;- ack for data up through packet8

</PRE>NOTE: After a packet is dropped, the receiver immediately sends an
acknowledgment indicating the receive position in the byte stream each time
it receives another packet that is past the hole. These additional acks for
packet 2 are a hint to the sender that there has been a dropped packet.
However, prior to Service Pack 2, this indication was not acted upon.
Instead, the sender continues sending up to the end of the send window,
then pauses. Eventually, the retransmission timer for packet3 expires, and
it is resent. An ack is returned for all of the data up through packet8,
and the sender starts out again. However, it engages congestion control
and starts slowly. As a result, the data throughput is not ideal.
<P>
<P><h3>The new behavior after applying Service Pack 2</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Sender     Receiver
   -------------------

   packet1 -&gt;
   packet2 -&gt;
              &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
   packet3 -&gt;    (assume this packet is lost)
   packet4 -&gt;
              &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
   packet5 -&gt;
              &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
   packet3 -&gt;    (new !!)
   packet6 -&gt;
              &lt;- ack for data up through packet6
   packet7 -&gt;
   packet8 -&gt;
              &lt;- ack for data up through packet8

</PRE>The new behavior exhibits the fast retransmit and recovery algorithm.  Now,
upon receiving three acks for the same sequence number, the sender will
quickly retransmit the missing segment, without waiting for the
retransmission timer to expire. It also will engage a lesser degree of
congestion control, as described in the before mentioned reference book.
