<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After your user account has been locked, then unlocked, Windows NT locks
you out again after you log on once more.
<P>
This problem occurs when the Windows NT domain has the Account Policy
configured to lockout user accounts after three bad password attempts.
<P>
To illustrate the problem, suppose a user logs on, logs off, gives three
bad passwords so they get locked out. The system Administrator unlocks
their account. The user logs on, logs off, logs on again but can't because
they are locked out again. It should default back to the account policy of
three bad logon attempts at this point, but it doesn't.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The bad password count information for your user account fails to get
written to the Security Account Manager (SAM) database.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, ask your administrator to delete and recreate
your user account and reassign all your domain privileges to your new
account.
<P>
NOTE: When your administrator recreates your account you to lose your
assigned access privileges on the domain because Windows NT assigns each
new user account a new security identifier (SID) regardless of whether or
not the account name matches a previous account name.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows
NT version 3.51 and Windows NT 4.0. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
