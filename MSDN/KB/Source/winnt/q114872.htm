The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.50
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.00
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Typically, only the Windows NT installation that created a volume set,
stripe set without parity, mirror set or stripe set with parity recognizes
and is able to use that set.  However, another installation of Windows NT
or Windows NT Advanced Server can be enabled to recognize and use the set
by using Disk Administrator to save the disk configuration information in
the Windows NT installation that created the volume and then restoring the
information under the other Windows NT installation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
See pages 528 and 529 of the Windows NT Advanced Server "System Guide" for
the specific steps to saving and restoring disk configuration information.
<P>
Once the disk configuration information from another installation of
Windows NT is restored, the current installation will recognize and be able
to use the volume sets, stripe sets with and without parity, and mirror
sets created by another installation of Windows NT. After disk
configuration information is restored:

<UL><LI>Installations of Windows NT Advanced Server can perform any function on
   a volume created by another installation of Windows NT that they could
   perform on volumes they created. This includes breaking mirrors and
   regenerating stripe sets with parity.
<P>
   -AND-

<LI>Installations of Windows NT can perform any function on a volume set or
   stripe without parity created by another installation of Windows NT that
   they could perform on volumes sets or stripes without parity that they
   created. They can also recognize, read from and write to mirror sets and
   stripe sets with parity created by Windows NT Advanced Server. However,
   Windows NT cannot break a mirror set or regenerate a stripe set with
   parity. In the event a partition is lost in a mirror set or stripe set
   with parity, recovery of the lost partition must be performed by Windows
   NT Advanced Server.
