The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system versions 3.1, 3.5, and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server versions 3.1, 3.5, and 3.51

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Setup allows you to install a single pointing device. If
you later use Setup to change to another pointing device, the first
pointing device is disabled.
<P>
This can present a problem, especially for users with portable
machines that use one mouse type when the machine is in a docking
station and a different mouse type when not in the docking station.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you have mouse support in only one of your machine's
configurations, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure both drivers are present on the machine. Setup never
   deletes driver files. Once you run Setup and select Mouse Port Mouse
   to install drivers, they remain on the machine until you explicitly
   delete them from the DRIVERS directory.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, choose the Devices icon, and make sure all
   relevant mouse drivers are marked with the System startup type (use
   the Startup button if necessary). The following table lists the mouse
   types and corresponding drivers for those drivers Microsoft supplies:
<P>
<PRE>      Mouse Type                                        Driver
      ----------------------------------------------------------

      Microsoft Mouse Port Mouse (includes BallPoint)   i8042prt
      Logitech Mouse Port Mouse                         i8042prt
      Microsoft InPort Bus Mouse                        inport
      Microsoft Serial Mouse                            sermouse
      Microsoft BallPoint Serial Mouse                  sermouse
      Logitech Serial Mouse                             sermouse
      Microsoft (green buttons) or Logitech Bus Mouse   busmouse

</PRE></OL>For the Compaq LTE and other machines in which one configuration
involves a Microsoft Mouse Port Mouse (also known as a PS/2-compatible
mouse), the solution is even simpler. The keyboard and PS/2-compatible
mouse share a driver; therefore, the Mouse Port Mouse support is
available without additional charge if you install the other mouse
type (usually serial) during Setup, everything will work from then on
with no further intervention.
