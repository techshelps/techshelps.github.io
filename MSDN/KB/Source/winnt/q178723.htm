The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to start an application by opening an associated document,
the application fails to start and you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Restrictions: This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in
   effect on this computer. Please contact your system administrator.

</PRE>This error occurs when there is a System Policy in effect that enables the
item marked "Run only allowed Windows applications."
<P>
This error is expected behavior if your application's executable is not in
the List of allowed applications dialog box. However, in this case, the
application is restricted even though it is included in this list.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The shell restriction implemented by the "Run only allowed Windows
applications" policy does not correctly parse file associations when the
executable path contains a space.
<P>
For instance, if a document of type TEST1 were opened by the application
APP1 with the path C:\Program Files\APP1\Binary Files\APP1.EXE %1, you
would encounter this problem when double-clicking on a TEST1 document.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can work around this problem by either surrounding the entire
association executable path with quotes, or by altering the executable path
into its equivalent 8.3 format. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>Run Regedt32.exe.

<P><LI>Open HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\APP1file\shell\open\command.

<P><LI>Modify the (Default) string value from its current path,
   C:\Program Files\APP1\Binary Files\APP1.EXE %1, to one of the following:
<P>
   "C:\Program Files\APP1\Binary Files\APP1.EXE %1" (notice the quotes)
<P>
   -or-
<P>
   C:\PROGRA~1\APP1\BINARY~1\APP1.EXE %1 (no quotes needed)
<P>
   NOTE: Use dir /x to determine 8.3 equivalents of long file names.
<P>
</OL>To resolve this problem on systems that do not have Internet Explorer 4.0,
obtain the following fix or wait for the next Window NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   01/05/98  03:55p             1,277,712 Shell32.dll (Intel)
   01/05/98  03:52p             1,866,000 Shell32.dll (Alpha)

</PRE></OL>Internet Explorer 4.0 ships with its own version of Shell32.dll. Installing
this fix may cause IE not to function correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
