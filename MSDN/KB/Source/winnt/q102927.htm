<P>
The Adaptec AHA-1540 and 1542 series adapters are popular SCSI hard
disk controllers because they can connect SCSI devices to ISA and EISA
type PC buses. This article provides some specific details concerning
these adapters, their default configuration settings, and some
distinctions between them.
<P>
<P><h3>Distinctions Between Adaptec Models</h3>
 
<P>
The sole distinction between the AHA-1540 and AHA-1542 models is that
the AHA-1542 has a floppy disk controller built into the card. A
letter after the model number indicates the chronological sequence in
which the devices were manufactured. The AHA-1540A and 1542A models
are the first in their series. These models are obsolete and not
supported under Windows NT. The AHA-1540B and 1542B models are no
longer manufactured by Adaptec, but they are supported under Windows
NT. The AHA-1540C and 1542C models are the latest production models of
these cards and are supported under Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h3>Suggested Default Adaptec Settings</h3>
 
<P>
Adaptec recommends you install the Adaptec 1540B, 1542B, 1540C, and
1542C using the default settings. The following table indicates the
factory default settings for these models with differences between the
two models noted. Also, the range of possible settings is included
where appropriate:
<P>
<PRE>Setting              Default                Range of Options
------------------   --------------------   -----------------------

SCSI Address         7                      0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

SCSI Parity          Enabled

Terminators          Installed (B Series)
                     Enabled (C Series)

DMA Channel          5                      0, 5, 6, 7

Interrupt Channel    11                     9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15

AT Port Address      330h                   130h, 134h, 230h, 234h,
                                            330h, 334h

AT BIOS Address      DC000h, Enabled        DC000h, D8000h, D4000h,
                                            D0000h, CC000h, C8000h

DMA Transfer Speed   5 MB/second

</PRE><h3>Host Adapter Termination, Cabling and Other Considerations</h3>
 
<P>
The AHA-1540 and 1542 series adapters require that the first and last
device on the SCSI bus be terminated. Devices in the middle of the
SCSI bus need to have their terminators removed or disabled.
Therefore, if you have only internal SCSI devices or only external
SCSI devices, the host adapter must be terminated. If your system has
both internal and external SCSI devices, the host adapter must not be
terminated.
<P>
Termination on the AHA-1540B and 1542B adapters is disabled by
removing the installed bus terminators. Termination on the AHA-1540C
and 1542C adapters is configurable by a hardware switch or by the host
adapter configuration software. The AHA-1540C and 1542C cards require
active terminators. Active terminators work best with active
components that conform to the SCSI-II standard.
<P>
The AHA-1540C and 1542C adapters are sensitive to the type of cabling.
Cabling must conform to the SCSI-II standard which recommends an
impedance of 110-132 ohms. Cable-related problems are likely to occur
when using an external cable since external cables usually have an
impedance of 60-80 ohms. Also, short external cables may help problems
related to signal loss.
<P>
The AHA-1540 and 1542 adapters may use the same upper memory addresses
as other installed devices such as network cards. To avoid memory
conflicts it may be necessary to manually re-configure the adapter
hardware by changing jumper settings, as the upper memory addresses
are not software configurable on these adapters.
<P>
The Windows NT mini-port driver, AHA154x.SYS, is the same driver used
for all the cards in this series. It is hard-coded to transfer data at
5 MB per second. Attempting to negotiate this setting through hardware
or software configuration will have no effect.
<P>
NOTE: The AHA154x.SYS driver is also used for the MCA version of this
adapter, the AHA-1640. This adapter is not supported on IBM PS/2 model
70 computers.
<P>
The AHA-1540B and 1542B adapters may require a BIOS and firmware
upgrade. They were only tested with firmware revisions 3.10 and 3.20.
Free BIOS and firmware upgrades are available from the Adaptec BBS:
(408) 945-7727.
