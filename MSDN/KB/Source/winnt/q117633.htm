<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how browsing over a wide area network (WAN) works
in a domain and a workgroup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Primary Domain Controller (PDC) of a WAN domain that spans subnets acts
as a domain master browser server. Each subnet in that domain has its own
master browser server, which sends master browser announcement requests to
the domain master browser.
<P>
On receipt of a request from a server, the domain master browser replies
with a remote NetServerEnum API, collects the servers from that master,
then merges that list with its current list. This guarantees that the
domain master browser server maintains a complete list of domain servers.
When a client remotely sends a NetServerEnum API to the domain master
browser server, the domain master returns to all servers in its browse
list.
<P>
WAN browsing support is available only in a domain environment among
Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server machines. If a domain contains
at least one Windows NT Advanced Server machine, you can browse that
domain. A subnet that has only Windows NT workstations running Browser
services can browse the entire contents of that domain.
<P>
To guarantee that the master browser for each subnet can access the PDC,
a domain's PDC must be listed in each client's LMHOSTS file. To guarantee
that the PDC can request the local subnet's list from the subnet master
browser, the TCP/IP transport must cache client addresses for some amount
of time. In addition, lists of domains retrieved by the master browser
have only the domains that are occupied by other master browser servers
in that domain.
<P>
Windows NT or WFW workgroups cannot span multiple subnets. Workgroups
can view only other workgroups on the local subnet.
<P>
Here are some conditions under which browsing does not work:

<OL><P><LI>Computers in a remote subnet cannot be seen by clients in a Windows NT
   or WFW workgroup. However, if there is a Windows NT on the workgroup,
   the workgroup administrator can configure one or more of the Windows
   NT workstations as "Configured Master Browsers," then add those
   computers in the remote subnet to the LMHOSTS file.

<P><LI>You cannot browse remote subnets with only WFW clients, because
   the WFW browser is not WAN-aware.

<P><LI>When browsing, you cannot see an isolated workgroup or a domain that
   is on a subnet with no machines in the current domain.
<P>
   For example: Suppose domain A spans 3 subnets(S1,S2 and S3). PDC for
   domain A is on S1. S2 has a BDC for domain A. S3 has an NT machine that
   is a part of domain A. S3 also has a few machines that belong to domain
   B, the PDC for which is elsewhere.
<P>
   Now, when the browse master of S3 (NT wksta) sends the list of servers
   in its local subnet to the PDC of domain A, it also sends a list of
   domains in its subnet that includes domain B. So PDC of domain A has a
   list of domains that has domain B listed in it. When browse master of
   S2 gets the browse list from PDC, it gets the list of domains as well,
   and that includes domain B. So it knows the existence of domain B. But
   for a client (on S2) to get the list of servers in domain B, it sends
   a request to its browse master on S2 and S2 in turn contacts the browse
   master of domain B on S3. For the browse master of S2 to contact the
   browse master of S3, its IP address has to be listed in its LMHOSTS
   file.
<P>
   Now, if S3 does not have any machines in its subnet that belong to
   domain A, then S1 and S2 cannot browse domain B.

<P><LI>You cannot browse domains on other subnets where the browse masters
   are not listed in the LMHOSTS file.
<P></OL>
