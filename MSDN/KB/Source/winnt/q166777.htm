</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you upgrade a computer running Windows NT Server 3.51 Service Pack 5
to Windows NT Server 4.0, then attempt to update File and Print Services
for NetWare (FPNW), the update process appears to be successful, but the
files may not actually be updated. The FPNW Service does not advertise
itself with SAP broadcasts, and you may not be able to connect to the
server through FPNW.
<P>
When you attempt to manage the FPNW server through Server Manager, you may
see the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Procedure entry point not found
   SPIN_SLE_NUM@@QAE@PAVOWNER_WINDOW@@IKKH@Z in Netui2.dll.

</PRE>When you click OK, another error is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot load extension FPNWMGR.CPL.  Error 0127. Specified procedure
   could not be found.

</PRE>You may receive similar errors when you click the FPNW icon in Control
Panel, if it is available.
<P>
NOTE: You may also have similar problems updating an FPNW Administrative
Tools Only installation.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The FPNW files that are installed by Windows NT Server 3.51 Service Pack 5
do not get properly updated due to an error in the Oemsetup.inf file for
File and Print Services for NetWare version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem, you will need to copy FPNW from the Services
for NetWare CD to a directory on your hard disk drive or local area
network.
<P>
WARNING: Editing Oemsetup.inf incorrectly can cause serious, system wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from editing
Oemsetup.inf can be solved. Do this at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Copy the FPNW files from the CD to a directory that you have full
   access to.

<P><LI>Open the file OEMSETUP.INF in a text editor such as Notepad or Edit.

<P><LI>In the section [Install-Update], locate the following line:
<P>
<PRE>   set STF_OVERWRITE    = "VERIFYSOURCEOLDER"

</PRE><P><LI>Change "VERIFYSOURCEOLDER" to "ALWAYS", save the file.

<P><LI>Perform this same change in the following sections:
<P>
   [Install-Exe]
   [Install-Tools]
<P>
</OL>After this procedure is complete, you can update FPNW from the new
location. You will need to restart the server for the change to take
effect.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0 and
File and Print Services for NetWare. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
