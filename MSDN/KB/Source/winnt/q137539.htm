<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the following error message while running Windows NT:
<P>
<PRE>   STOP 0x0000007F (UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These messages may be caused by hardware or software problems, but the most
common cause is hardware failure.
<P>
The above STOP error means a trap occurred in kernel mode and the trap is
either one the kernel is not allowed to have or is always fatal. The most
common causes of a STOP 0x7F are:

<UL><LI>Low-level hardware corruption, such as corrupt memory (RAM)

<LI>Mismatched memory modules

<LI>A malfunctioning motherboard
<P>
</UL>To determine an approximate cause, examine the parameters at the top of the
STOP screen:
<P>
<PRE>   **STOP 0x0000007F (0x000000XX, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)
   UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP

</PRE>The most important parameter is the first one (0x0000000X) which may have
several different values. The cause of this trap can vary, depending on the
value of this parameter. All traps that cause a STOP 0x7F can be found in
any Intel x86 microprocessor reference manual as they are specific to the
x86 platform. Here are some of the most common ones:
<P>
<PRE>   Values       Meaning
   ----------   --------------------
   0x00000000   Divide by Zero Error
   0x00000004   Overflow
   0x00000005   Bounds Check Fault
   0x00000006   Invalid Opcode
   0x00000008   Double Fault

</PRE><h3>Divide by Zero Error</h3>
 
<P>
A divide by zero is caused when a DIV instruction is executed and the
divisor is 0. Memory corruption (or other hardware problems) or software
failures can cause this.
<P>
<P><h3>Overflow</h3>
 
<P>
The overflow instruction occurs when the processor executes a call to an
interrupt handler when the overflow (OF) flag is set.
<P>
<P><h3>Bounds Check Fault</h3>
 
<P>
This fault is generated when the processor, while executing a BOUND
instruction, finds the operand exceeds the specified limits. A BOUND
instruction is used to ensure that a signed array index is within a certain
range.
<P>
<P><h3>Invalid Opcode</h3>
 
<P>
This fault is generated when the processor attempts to execute an invalid
instruction. This is generally caused when the instruction pointer has
become corrupted and is pointing to the wrong location. The most common
cause of this is hardware memory corruption.
<P>
<P><h3>Double Fault</h3>
 
<P>
A double fault occurs when an exception occurs while trying to call the
handler for a prior exception. Normally, the two exceptions can be handled
serially, however there are several exceptions that cannot be handled
serially and in this situation the processor signals a double fault. This
is almost always caused by hardware problems.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If either software or hardware can cause a particular trap, a debug is
required to determine which is the cause. If you suspect a hardware
problem, try the following hardware troubleshooting steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run diagnostic software and test the RAM in the computer. Replace
   any RAM reported as bad. Also, make sure all the RAM in the computer
   is the same speed.

<P><LI>Try removing or swapping out controllers, cards, or other peripherals.

<P><LI>Try a different motherboard on the computer.
<P>
</OL>For more information on processor faults, consult an Intel processor
reference manual.
