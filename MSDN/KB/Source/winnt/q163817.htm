The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To access the Novell Printers from the Microsoft Client computers without
NetWare client software, you can create a gateway using Gateway Services
for NetWare (GSNW) that comes with Windows NT Server. You can make gateways
for resources located on NetWare Directory Service (NDS) trees as well as
for resources on servers running NetWare 2.x or later with bindery
security. These resources include volumes, directories, printers, and
print queues.
<P>
GSNW also enables users working locally at the Windows NT Server computer
to directly access NetWare file and print resources, both on NDS trees and
on servers with bindery security.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before you can create a gateway on a Windows NT Server computer:

<UL><LI>You must have a user account on the NetWare network with the necessary
   rights for the resources you want to access.

<LI>The NetWare server must have a group named NTGATEWAY with the necessary
   rights for the resources you want to access.

<LI>The NetWare user account you use must be a member of the NTGATEWAY
   group.
<P>
</UL>The NetWare user account you use to enable gateways can be either an NDS
account or a bindery account. If the server will have gateways to both NDS
resources and resources on servers running bindery security, the user
account must be a bindery account. (This account can connect to NDS
resources through bindery emulation). If you create gateways only to NDS
resources, the account can be an NDS account.
<P>
Creating a gateway is a two-step process.

<OL><P><LI>First you enable gateways on the server running Windows NT Server.
   When you enable a gateway, you must type the name and password of the
   user account that has access to the NetWare server and is a member of
   the NTGATEWAY group on that NetWare server.
<P>
   If you are activating a gateway to an NDS resource, and the gateway user
   account is a bindery user account, you should specify the resource using
   the bindery context name.
<P>
   If you are using a NDS user account, and you do not plan on also
   creating gateways to bindery resources, than you can specify the NDS
   resource name. You need to do this only once for each server that will
   act as a gateway.

<P><LI>To activate a gateway for a print queue, use Print Manager.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Setup the Printer on the Windows NT 4.0 Computer</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Printers. Double-
   click the Add Printer icon.

<P><LI>Click the My computer radio button.

<P><LI>Click Add Port.

<P><LI>Double-click on Local Port.

<P><LI>Type in the UNC name format (\\&lt;servername&gt;\&lt;printername&gt;) of the Novell
   server and printer name (this should be the same UNC name when you
   browse the NetWare network).

<P><LI>Click OK and Close.

<P><LI>Select the correct driver for the printer.

<P><LI>Type in the printer name.

<P><LI>Share out the printer. This is the name that the Client will see
   when browsing for the printer.

<P><LI>Click finish and test the printout.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to setup the printer on a Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 Computer</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From Print Manager, select Create Printer.

<P><LI>At the Create Printer dialog box, type in the printer name, and then
   select the correct printer driver.

<P><LI>Select OTHER in the PRINT TO: box and double-click on Local Port.

<P><LI>Type in the UNC name format (\\&lt;servername&gt;\&lt;printername&gt;) of the Novell
   server and printer name (this should be the same UNC name when you
   browse the NetWare network).

<P><LI>Click on the share this printer on the network box and type in the
   share name.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>Security for gateway resources is provided on two levels:

<UL><LI>On the computer running Windows NT Server and acting as a gateway,
   you can set share-level permissions for each resource made available
   through the gateway.

<LI>On the NetWare file server, the NetWare administrator can assign
   trustee rights to the user account used for the gateway or to the
   Ntgateway group.  These rights will be enforced for all Microsoft
   client users who access the resource through the gateway.
<P>
</UL>There is no auditing of gateway access.
<P>
NOTE: Because requests from Microsoft networking clients are being
processed through the gateway, access is slower than direct access from the
client to the NetWare network. Clients that require frequent access to
NetWare resources should run Windows NT Workstation with the Client Service
for NetWare or Windows 95 with its NetWare client software, to achieve
higher performance.
