The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
On a computer running Windows NT with multiple IP addresses assigned to the
same network interface card, resolving the computer's HOST or NetBIOS name
will return the last IP address listed in the Network Control Panel
Advanced TCP/IP Properties, rather than the first address listed. All other
computers on the network that resolve this name will correctly get the
first IP address listed.
<P>
This can cause problems with applications that are running on a computer
that performs a lookup of its own HOST name. One example of this is when
you use Microsoft FrontPage and Internet Information Server (IIS) with
multiple virtual servers.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using DNS for name resolution, you can add an additional A
record for the same computer, with a different name. For example, if your
computer name is listed in DNS as WEBSERVER, you may also want to add an
entry in DNS for WWW that refers to the same IP address. In this case, when
you type "PING WWW," the name is not resolved locally, but rather at the
DNS server, and the correct IP address will be indicated in the reply.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. 
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is an example of this configuration:
<P>
<PRE>   HOST name = MACHINE1
   Assigned IP Addresses #1= 192.168.1.1
   Assigned IP Addresses #2= 192.168.1.2
   Assigned IP Addresses #3= 192.168.1.3

</PRE>If you are at MACHINE1 and type "PING MACHINE1," your reply will indicate
the 192.168.1.3 address.
<P>
If you are at another computer on the network and type "PING MACHINE1,"
your reply will indicate the 192.168.1.1 address.
