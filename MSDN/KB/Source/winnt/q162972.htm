The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Backup program included with Windows NT (Ntbackup.exe) is a basic tape
backup program. It can back up mapped network drives, local drives, and
the registry. Backups can span multiple tapes. Backup does not support
backing up to removable media other than tape.
<P>
This article describes how to troubleshoot problems with Backup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Tape Drive Is Not Recognized</h3>
 
<P>
The most common reason for this is a problem with the SCSI bus. Verify
that the cables are properly attached to the tape drive and that the SCSI
bus is correctly terminated.
<P>
<P><h3>Error Writing to Tape</h3>
 
<P>
This may be due to a problem with the SCSI bus or a bad tape. When you
reuse tapes, be sure to erase them first. Format and retension the tape
before reuse if you can.
<P>
<P><h3>Invalid Media</h3>
 
<P>
Check to be certain you have inserted the correct type of tape for your
tape device. This may also be an indication that the tape is bad and needs
to be replaced.
<P>
<P><h3>Skipped Files</h3>
 
<P>
Backup cannot back up files that are locked open by another process. If
the file does not become available in 30 seconds, the file is skipped.
<P>
Close as many running programs as you can before you perform a backup.
There are some third-party backup programs that allow you to back up open
files.
<P>

   TITLE     : Files Skipped with Windows NT Backup

</PRE><h3>Fatal Error on Drive 1</h3>
 
<P>
This is usually caused by either incompatible hardware or out-of-date
firmware on the tape device or controller. Consult the Hardware
Compatibility List to make sure your hardware is supported, then check
with the manufacturer to see if there is a firmware update available.

This occurs when the catalog file on the hard disk contains incomplete
information. Quitting and restarting Backup may resolve the issue. If not,
locate the catalog file on the hard disk and either rename it or delete
it, and then re-catalog the tape.

</PRE>Catalog Information: Unable to Load Catalog Data from Tape -or- Catalog
Error: Error Writing a Catalog File, Check Available Space
 
<P>
These error messages can be generated by trying to restore to a full hard
disk. The catalog files are stored in a compressed format and need to be
expanded on the hard disk at the beginning of the restore operation. You
can resolve these errors by either freeing disk space on the target drive,
or by replacing the hard disk with a larger drive.
