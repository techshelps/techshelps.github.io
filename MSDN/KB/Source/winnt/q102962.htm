The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<P>
</UL>The article contains REGISTRY entries for Microsoft Mail,
Part 2. There are no subgroups.
 
<P>
This is the second of three articles on the MS Mail entries; for the other
entries, see "Microsoft Mail Entries, Part 1" and "Microsoft Mail Entries,
Part 3".
<P>
<P><h2>REGISTRY ENTRIES FOR MICROSOFT MAIL</h2>
 
<P>
The parameters used by the Microsoft Mail application provided with Windows
NT appear under this subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail

</PRE>This key includes the following subkeys:
<P>
<PRE>Subkey              Purpose
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>Address Book        Secifies entries used by the Address Book support
                    functions for the Mail program.
Custom Commands     Specifies a custom command that can be installed into
                    one of the Mail menus at run-time.
Custom Messages     Specifies a custom message type that is installed into
                    a Mail menu at run-time.
Custom Menus        Specifies a custom menu name to be added to the Mail
                    menu bar.
Microsoft Mail      Defines the configuration of the Mail program, and the
                    Microsoft Mail transport and name service.
MMF                 Affects the automatic compression of the Mail message
                    file.
Mac File Types      Defines the mapping from Macintosh file type and
                    creator tags into eight-plus-three character filename
                    extensions.
Providers           Defines settings that service providers use Microsoft
                    Mail front-end programs.

</PRE>Many of the entries in these subkeys have default values and won't be
present in the Mail subkeys. To change the appearance and behavior of the
Mail application, use the Mail menu commands instead of editing the Mail
entries directly. Some of the options that you specify in the Mail
application are stored in your mail message file (.mmf) instead of the Mail
Registry entries.
<P>
These keys are created in HKEY_CURRENT_USER when you first run Mail. If
your system previously contained a Windows for MS-DOS version of
MSMAIL.INI, its contents are migrated to the Registry when you first run
Mail under Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>MICROSOFT MAIL ENTRIES</h2>
 
<P>
This subkey is used to define the appearance and behavior of the Mail
program. This is the Registry path for this subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Microsoft Mail

</PRE>This key also appears under HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT, but its only contents are
MigrateIni and MigrateIniPrint.
<P>
These are the value entries that can appear in this key:
<P>
<PRE>CheckLatencyInterval   REG_SZ   seconds
</PRE> 
Default: 30 seconds
<P>
Affects the mail spooler's latency checking, which is intended to prevent
spooler background processing from interfering with foreground work. If the
specified length of time passes without the spooler having any work to do,
the latency algorithm is reinitialized.
<P>
<PRE>DemosEnabled   REG_SZ    0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: 0 (The Mail demos are not provided with Windows NT.)
<P>
Specifies whether the Demos menu option is to be displayed in the Help
menu. If the value of the entry is 1, the Demos menu option is displayed in
the Help menu. If this entry is 0, the Demos menu option is not shown.
<P>
<PRE>ExportMmfFile   REG_SZ    filename
</PRE> 
<P>
Identifies the path and filename for a .MMF file pointing to the last place
a mail folder was exported to. This entry is written by the Mail program
and is used as a default value for display in the Export Folder dialog box
when you choose Export Folders from the File menu in Mail.
<P>
<PRE>FixedFont   REG_SZ   facename, size, 0 or 1, 0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: Courier New, 9, 0, 0
<P>
Identifies the fixed-pitch font used to display the body text of a mail
message. This entry has four parts, each separated by a comma: typeface
name (not the font file name), point size, flag for bold, and flag for
italic. The Change Font command on the View menu toggles between the Normal
font and the Fixed font.
<P>
<PRE>ForceScanInterval   REG_SZ   seconds
</PRE> 
Default: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
<P>
Affects the mail spooler's latency checking, which is intended to prevent
the spooler background processing from interfering with foreground work. If
the designated length of time passes without the spooler getting an
opportunity to do outstanding work, idle time is requested more frequently
(based on the value of ScanAgainInterval), and eventually idle time is used
whenever it can.
<P>
<PRE>GALOnly   REG_SZ   0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: 0
<P>
If this entry is set to 1, the Mail address book displays only the Global
Address List and the personal address book, thereby providing a flat
address list of all the users visible from your postoffice. You must be
running against a PC Mail 3.0 or higher postoffice with global address list
support for this to work. GALOnly is currently supported only by the PC
Mail name service provider.
<P>
<PRE>IdleRequiredInterval   REG_SZ   seconds
</PRE> 
Default: 2 seconds
<P>
Affects the mail spooler's latency checking, which is intended to prevent
the spooler's background processing from interfering with foreground work.
The spooler defers its work temporarily if the system has serviced an
interactive request such as a keyboard entry or mouse movement within this
interval, to avoid starting a transfer when the user is busy.
<P>
<PRE>LocalMMF   REG_SZ   0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: 1
<P>
Specifies the location where the user's mail message file (.MMF) is created
when the user runs Mail for the first time. If this entry is 0, the user's
Mail messages are stored in the postoffice on the server. If this entry is
1, the user's .MMF file is created locally in the SystemRoot directory
rather than on the postoffice the first time Mail is run. Also, this value
set to 1, in conjunction with the NoServerOptions entry, prevents .MMF
files from being stored in the postoffice.
<P>
<PRE>Login   REG_SZ   mailbox name
</PRE> 
Default: (blank)
<P>
Identifies the default User Name (up to 10 characters) displayed in the
Mail Sign In dialog box used to log into Mail. If you set both the Login
and Password entries, the Login dialog is not displayed when you start
Mail, and your mailbox is immediately displayed. If you set just Login,
Mail prompts for your password only.
<P>
<PRE>MailBeep   REG_SZ   filename
</PRE> 
Default: (blank)-Mail beeps twice when new mail arrives.
<P>
Specifies the path name of a .WAV file to change the sound that Mail uses
to notify the user when new mail arrives. This entry is ignored if the
Sound Chime option in the Mail Options dialog box is not checked.
<P>
Mail looks at this entry only if it can't find a MailBeep entry in the
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Sounds subkey.
<P>
<PRE>MailTmp   REG_SZ   Pathname
</PRE> 
Default:  The value of the TEMP environment variable. If there is no TEMP
variable, the default is the SystemRoot directory.
<P>
Set this entry to a directory where Mail can place temporary copies of
attached files. When you launch an application by double- clicking a file
attached to a mail message, Mail copies the file to this directory and runs
the application.
<P>
<PRE>MAPIHELP   REG_SZ    filename
</PRE> 
Default:  The MSMAIL32.HLP file in the user's SystemRoot\SYSTEM32 directory
(for example, C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\MSMAIL32.HLP).
<P>
Specifies the MAPI Help file to be used when the user requests help in any
of the dialog boxes displayed by the MAPI support functions. This entry is
defined when the Mail program is run for the first time.
<P>
<PRE>MigrateIni   REG_SZ   0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: 1 (yes)
<P>
Specifies whether to migrate the Mail .INI files created by a Windows for
MS DOS version of Mail for use under Windows NT. This entry is saved in the
HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Mail subkey. In HKEY_CURRENT_USER,
this entry is deleted after the user first runs Mail.
<P>
<PRE>MigrateIniPrint   REG_SZ   0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: 1 (yes)
<P>
Specifies whether to migrate the Mail .INI print information created by a
Windows for MS-DOS version of Mail for use under Windows NT. This entry is
saved in the HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Mail subkey. In
HKEY_CURRENT_USER, this entry is deleted after the user first runs Mail.
<P>
<PRE>Multi-Message   REG_SZ   0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: 1 (That is, the check box is checked by default.)
<P>
Defines the last setting chosen for the Print Multiple Notes On A Page
check box in the Print dialog box, which appears when you print messages
from Mail. Set this entry to 0 for that option to appear unchecked by
default.
<P>
<PRE>NetBios   REG_SZ   0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: 1
<P>
Enables NetBIOS notification of new mail delivery. When NetBIOS
notification is used, the Windows NT computer sending a mail message to
another Windows NT computer sends a NetBIOS notification message to the
destination computer to tell the Mail program running on that machine that
a new mail message was sent to the computer. The Mail program on the
destination computer can then check the workgroup postoffice for the new
mail message. This entry set to 1 to enable NetBIOS notification also
provides quicker response to the arrival of new mail from users on your
local postoffice. If this entry is 0 to disable NetBIOS notification, the
Mail client needs to regularly check for the arrival of new mail messages
on the postoffice.
<P>
<PRE>NewMsgsAtStartup   REG_SZ   0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: 0
<P>
Specifies whether Mail is to check for new mail messages in the foreground
as soon as the user logs in. Set this entry to 1 to have Mail download new
messages as quickly as possible when it is started. If this entry is 0,
Mail checks for new messages in the background (as is usually the case when
the Mail application is being used).
<P>
<PRE>NextOnMoveDelete   REG_SZ   0 or 1 or -1
</PRE> 
Default: 1
<P>
If this entry is 1, Mail automatically opens the next message in a folder
after you delete or move an open message. If set to -1, mail automatically
opens the previous message. This facilitates quick scanning through the
inbox. If set to 0, Mail closes the Read Note window after you move or
delete the message, and you must press ENTER or double-click to open the
next message. Use 1 for messages sorted in ascending order (in the order
received) and -1 for messages sorted in descending order (most recent
message first).
<P>
<PRE>NormalFont   REG_SZ   facename, size, 0 or 1, 0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: Helv, 10, 0, 0 (The FontSubstitutes subkey defines the mapping of
the Helv font to a font present on the local computer.)
<P>
Identifies the default font (normally proportionally spaced) used to
display Mail messages. This entry has four parts, each separated by a
comma: typeface name (not the font file name), point size, flag for bold,
and flag for italic. The Change Font command in the View menu toggles
between the Normal font and the Fixed font. The latter is useful for
viewing messages that were created using a fixed-pitch font. Both entries
affect only message body text, not the message envelope text or folder
lists; Mail uses Helv 8 for that purpose.
<P>
<PRE>NoServerOptions   REG_SZ   0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: 0
<P>
If this entry is 1, the Server button in the Mail Options dialog box is
unconditionally disabled. On the Mail server, this button calls up another
dialog box that enables the user to relocate the .MMF file. Together with
the LocalMMF entry, this entry prevents .MMF files from being stored on the
postoffice.
<P>
<PRE>OfflineMessages   REG_SZ   Pathname
</PRE> 
Default: The path specified in the Mail Options Server dialog for a local
message file.
<P>
Defines the file location when you choose to store your message file
somewhere other than the postoffice. When you start up without connecting
to the postoffice, this entry locates the file quickly (without presenting
a File Browse dialog box). The entry is removed when you store your message
file at the postoffice.
<P>
NOTE: If you start online and your .MMF file is not on the postoffice,
OfflineMessages is not used. Use the Mail Server Options dialog box to move
your .MMF file.
<P>
<PRE>OldStorePath   REG_SZ   Pathname
</PRE> 
<P>
Contains the original path to a file that was originally stored in a place
other than the postoffice. This entry is written.temporarily by the Mail
transport while you are moving your message file (using the Mail Options
Server dialog box). This entry is removed after the move completes
successfully and only appears if the system crashes during a move.
<P>
<PRE>Password   REG_SZ   password
</PRE> 
Default: (blank)-you are prompted for a password by the Mail program.
<P>
Use this entry and the Login entry to provide Mail with your account
information, without being required to type this information into the Mail
Sign In dialog box each time. If there is no password, leave the value for
this entry blank, but do not omit the entry. Omitting the entry means you
want to type your password each time in the Mail Sign In dialog box when
you start Mail.
<P>
<PRE>PollingInterval   REG_SZ   minutes
</PRE> 
Default: 10
<P>
Gives the default for the Check for New Mail Every n Minutes option in the
Mail Options dialog box. The value the user enters in the dialog box is
written to the user's mail message file (.MMF)-this value is used to define
how often the Mail spooler checks for new mail messages.
<P>
<PRE>Printer   REG_SZ   printer name, driver name, port
</PRE> 
Default: the default printer specified in Print Manager
<P>
This is the printer that appears in the Mail Print dialog box and is used
by Mail when printing messages.
<P>
<PRE>PumpCycleInterval   REG_SZ   seconds
</PRE> 
Default: 60 seconds, or the number of minutes specified in the Mail Options
dialog box
<P>
Permits the spooler to check for new mail more often than once per minute,
or to override the polling interval value defined in the user's mail
message file.
<P>
<PRE>ReplyPrefix   REG_SZ   String
</PRE> 
Default: (blank)
<P>
If this entry is present, Mail distinguishes your comments from the
original message when you reply to mail. When you reply, the original
message text is copied to the body of the reply message, and each line of
the original is prefixed with the string specified by this entry. If the
string contains a space, enclose it within double quotation marks (for
example, "| "-a vertical bar followed by a space).
<P>
<PRE>ScanAgainInterval   REG_SZ   seconds
</PRE> 
Default: 2
<P>
Affects the mail spooler latency checking to prevent spooler background
processing from interfering unduly with foreground work. When the spooler
defers work because of higher priority, interactive tasks, it rechecks the
availability of the system at this interval.
<P>
<PRE>Security   REG_SZ   0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: 0
<P>
If this entry is 1, Mail prompts for your password whenever itswindow is
restored from its iconic state. That is, if Mail is minimized and you
double-click on the icon, you must re-enter your password before you (or
anyone else) can see your messages.
<P>
<PRE>ServerPassword   REG_SZ   password
</PRE> 
Default: (blank)
<P>
Identifies the password used to connect to the server specified by the
ServerPath entry. This entry should be used to specify the password for the
file share if the form of the ServerPath entry is specified using the
universal naming conventions (UNC) and the server, share, or the path name
contains spaces. If this entry is present, the value for the ServerPath
entry is interpreted literally, and any spaces present in the value for the
entry is used when dynamically connecting to the workgroup postoffice.
<P>
If the ServerPassword entry is used, do not specify a password for the
ServerPath entry (the password will be misinterpreted, and the resulting
path to the workgroup postoffice will be invalid). The ServerPassword entry
is written by the Mail program when connecting for the first time to the
workgroup postoffice and is stored in the Microsoft Mail key file in
encrypted format. Do not change this entry.
<P>
<PRE>   ServerPath   REG_SZ   Pathname
   ServerPath   REG_SZ   \\server\share\path  password
   ServerPath   REG_SZ   server/share:path

</PRE>If this entry is present, Mail searches for the postoffice in the specified
directory. The first form, with a normal path name, works on all networks-
the connection to the file share containing the network postoffice must be
made before running the Mail program. The second form (UNC) works only on
Windows NT and on Microsoft networks and compatibles. If you use the UNC
form, Mail connects dynamically (without using a drive) to the file server
where the postoffice resides. (If the specified UNC name contains any
spaces, the password for the share needs to be specified for the
ServerPassword entry.) The third form works only on Novell NetWare networks
and uses an unused drive letter to connect dynamically to the NetWare file
server where the postoffice resides. If no value is specified for the
ServerPath entry, Mail asks the user for a path to the workgroup postoffice
and writes a new value for this entry.
<P>
<PRE>   SharedExtensionsDir   REG_SZ   Pathname
   SharedExtensionsDir   REG_SZ   \\server\share\path  password

</PRE>If this entry is present, Mail searches for shared custom commands and
messages in the specified directory. The SHARED32.INI file in that
directory identifies the shared extensions to load. Additional extensions
can be entered in the Microsoft Mail key. Administrators often provide a
common share point for extensions to Mail to simplify updating the
extensions, and this entry makes it work. The first form with a normal path
name works on all networks. The second form works only on Windows NT and on
Microsoft networks and compatibles. If the second form is used, Mail
connects dynamically (without using a drive) to the file server where the
shared extensions reside.
<P>
<PRE>SharedFolders   REG_SZ   0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: 1
<P>
Enables the use of Mail shared folders. If this entry is 1, the user can
access shared folders. If this entry is 0, shared folders are unavailable
to the user.
<P>
<PRE>SpoolerBackoffInterval   REG_SZ   milliseconds
</PRE> 
Default: 2000 (two seconds)
<P>
Specifies the amount of time the mail spooler waits before retrying an
operation that has failed because of a transient mail server error
condition, such as a locked file.
<P>
<PRE>SpoolerReconnectInterval   REG_SZ   seconds
</PRE> 
Default: 60 (one minute)
<P>
Specifies the amount of time the mail spooler waits before retrying an
operation that has failed because of a fatal mail server error condition,
such as a lost network connection.
<P>
<PRE>StripGatewayHeaders   REG_SZ   0 or 1
</PRE> 
<P>
If this entry is 1, message header text that appears above the dashed line
is stripped from PC Mail messages that arrive via a gateway. Set this value
to 0 if you want to see the extended information supplied by the gateways,
which typically includes items such as message identifiers specific to the
foreign mail system.
<P>
Message header text supplied by native PC Mail clients is always stripped.
Only the PC Mail transport supports this entry. Default: 1 (That is, you
don't see gateway information.)
<P>
<PRE>WG   REG_SZ   0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: 1
<P>
Specifies whether the version of the Mail program running on the computer
is the Mail program provided with Windows NT. This entry is used internally
by the Mail application and is written by the Mail program when it is
executed.
<P>
<PRE>Window    REG_SZ   Left Top Right Bottom Zoom
                   Toolbar Statusbar Scrollbars
</PRE> 
Default:  window size and location determined by Windows NT, zoom state
normal (restored), toolbar on, status bar on, scroll bars on.
<P>
Specifies the zero-relative position within its menu where the main Mail
window is to appear. This entry consists of eight numbers that govern the
display of the main Mail window. This information is written when you exit
Mail, and the changes you made while Mail was running are lost. The format
for this entry is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>Value               Definition
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>Left Top            The first four numbers are pixel coordinates
Right Bottom        for the four sides of the main window in this
                    order: left, top, right, bottom.
Zoom                The zoom value is:
                       1 main window is in a normal (restored) state
                       2 maximixed (zoomed)
                       3 minimized (by icon)
Toolbar             Determines when the toolbar, status bar and
Statusbar           scroll bars are displayed on the mnain window:
Scrollbars          0 corresponding bar is not displayed 1 bar is displayed
