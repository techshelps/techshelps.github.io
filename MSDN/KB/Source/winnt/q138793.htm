<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
MPR (Multi-Protocol Router) consists of the following: RIP (Routing
Information Protocol) for TCP/IP, BOOTP (Boot Protocol) relay agent for
DHCP, and RIP for IPX. RIP is used by routers to dynamically exchange
routing information. With RIP for IP and RIP for IPX installed, Windows NT
will route these protocols and dynamically exchange routing information
with other routers running the RIP protocol. The BOOTP relay agent will
allow the Windows NT Router to forward DHCP requests to DHCP servers on
other subnets. This allows one DHCP server to service multiple IP subnets.
See Riproute.wri in the MPR directory for additional documentation on MPR.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installation</h3>
 
<P>
MPR requires Windows NT Server 3.51 and Service Pack 2. In addition, two or
more network cards are needed for full MPR functionality.
<P>
To install MPR:

<OL><P><LI>Run UPDATE.EXE from the MPR\i386 directory (or the directory for the
   appropriate hardware type) on the Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 2 CD-ROM
   disc.
<P>
   Update.exe copies files to your Windows NT installation and make new
   software choices available under Control Panel Network (Add Software).
<P>
   NOTE: You need to run this UPDATE.EXE program in addition to the
   UPDATE.EXE program used to install Service Pack 2.

<P><LI>Run Control Panel, click Network, and click Add Software.

<P><LI>Select RIP for Internet Protocol, Bootp Relay Agent, or RIP for NWlink
   IPX/SPX compatible transport, and then click Continue.

<P><LI>When prompted, provide the path for the MPR distribution files (for
   example, D:\MPR\I386).
<P>
</OL>WARNING: After you install RIP, Windows NT will start exchanging routing
information with other RIP routers. If you have misconfigured the IP
address of your network cards or used a fake IP address, this could have a
severe impact on your network. Do not install RIP without fully
understanding TCP/IP and the design of your network.
<P>
<P><h3>RIP for IP, Configuration and Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<P>
No manual configuration is needed. After installing RIP for IP, the Enable
IP Routing box in Advanced TCP/IP configuration will automatically be
selected. RIP for IP runs as a service and can be stopped and started using
Control Panel Services.
<P>
To see what routes your computer has, type ROUTE PRINT at the Windows NT
Command Prompt. This will show the routes that Windows NT creates by
default, and routes learned through RIP.
<P>
If RIP for IP is installed on a computer that has only one network card,
it is configured for Silent Mode. In Silent Mode, Windows NT listens to RIP
broadcasts and updates its route table but does not advertise its own
routes. If an additional network card is later installed in the computer,
RIP will automatically turn off Silent Mode and enable IP routing.
<P>
<P><h3>Bootp Relay Agent, Configuration and Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<P>
After you install the BOOTP Relay Agent you will be prompted with a
configuration screen. You must enter the IP address of DHCP servers that
you would like to send DHCP requests to. Maximum Hops and Seconds Threshold
can be left at the defaults. If you later need to change the configuration,
click the Config Relay Agent button under Advanced TCP/IP Configuration.
<P>
RIP for NWlink IPX/SPX compatible Transport,
Configuration and Troubleshooting
 
<P>
When installing RIP for NWlink, Setup displays a message that NetBIOS
Broadcast Propagation (broadcast of type 20 packet) is currently disabled.
If you are using NetBIOS over IPX or are unsure, choose Yes to enable
broadcast of type 20 packets. Reboot the computer as directed. Type 20
broadcast can be later configured by selecting RIP for NWlink IPX in
Control Panel Network and clicking configure.
<P>
Enable RIP Routing is automatically selected when you install RIP for
NWlink IPX. RIP for NWlink IPX can be enabled or disabled by clicking
Enable RIP Routing in NWlink IPX/SPX Protocol Configuration. The SAP agent
is automatically installed with RIP for NWlink IPX. SAP is a service, and
can be started and stopped from Control Panel Services. Microsoft
recommends that you configure the Internal Network number through the
NWLink configuration in Control Panel Network. If you do not, a random
number will be generated for you.
<P>
The command line utility Ipxroute.exe has been updated and can be
used to get RIP, SAP, and source routing information and statistics.
<P>
For more information on MPR, refer to Riproute.wri in the Windows NT
3.51 Service Pack 2 CD-ROM disc \MPR directory.
