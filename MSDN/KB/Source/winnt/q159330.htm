The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The MS-DOS-based programs included with FPNW, such as Map.exe and
Login.exe, that are supposed to modify environment variables do not work as
expected when run in a Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) under Windows, but do work
as expected outside of Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These programs, when shipped with FPNW, use an incorrect function call to
modify the program's environment space, rather than the environment space
of the VDM.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use the Novell versions of these programs, as they work as expected. Or
obtain the update mentioned in the Status section.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft File and Print
Services for NetWare version 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In MS-DOS, every process has a block of memory associated with it in which
environment variables are stored.  When a new process is started, it
inherits a copy of the environment belonging to its parent process. By
default, when an application changes its own environment variables, those
changes are not reflected in the parent process's environment space.
Rather, an application must take explicit action to change the environment
of its parent process.
<P>
When running an MS-DOS prompt within a Windows environment, there are up to
four separate levels of environment spaces to be considered:

<OL><P><LI>The base environment of MS-DOS before Windows is started.

<P><LI>The Windows environment, which will be inherited by any MS-DOS windows
   started by Windows.

<P><LI>The environment of the VDM associated with the MS-DOS window.

<P><LI>The environment of the application, such as Map.exe. This environment is
   destroyed when the application terminates.
<P>
</OL>The problem with the files shipped with FPNW is that they were altering
environments 1 and 4 in the previous list. The fixed Map.exe described here
and the Map.exe provided by Novell also alter environment 3. Neither
program modifies environment 2.
