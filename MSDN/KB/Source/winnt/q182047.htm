The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a large number (hundreds) of scopes are configured on a Windows NT 4.0
DHCP server, performance degrades to where it cannot keep up with large
client loads such as those experienced after a power failure, or at peak
network startup times.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A list of scopes is maintained in the registry. When a DHCP DISCOVER or
DHCP REQUEST is received, it must be matched against the configured scopes
to see if the server is able to provide services to the client subnet. This
process of searching through the scopes was not optimized for large numbers
of scopes. Additionally, some database calls could experience suboptimal
performance caused by nonoptimal database buffer initialization.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next
Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   03/03/98  03:52p              118,544 Dhcpssvc.dll (Intel)
   03/03/98  03:49p              189,712 Dhcpssvc.dll (Alpha)

</PRE>NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to the computer running Windows NT 4.0
prior to applying this fix.
<P>
NOTE: This hotfix supersedes the fixes referred to in the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The updated file caches the entire scope list in memory, and uses a binary
search to quickly determine if the server has a scope that is relevant to
each client request. This update dramatically reduces the number of times
that registry keys are opened and searched. It also provides more buffers
for interaction with the database, which improves database throughput.
