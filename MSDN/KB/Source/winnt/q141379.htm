<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a writable CD-ROM drive is attached to a system running Windows NT,
the device may not be recognized. This holds true not only for the ability
to write to the device, but reading from it may also not be possible.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A writable CD-ROM device can present itself to the SCSI adapter in one
of 2 ways:
<P>
The device may present itself as a WORM (Write Once Read Many) device. Many
writable CD-ROM devices uses this means of identification to the SCSI host
adapter. Unfortunately, since Windows NT does not support WORM devices,
this means of identification prevents Windows NT from being able to access
the device.
<P>
More recently, writable CD-ROM devices have become available that present
themselves to the SCSI host adapter as a standard CD-ROM device. Such
units are likely to be compatible with Windows NT. Although compatibility
of every such device cannot be guaranteed, this manner of identification to
the SCSI adapter is one prerequisite that a writable CD-ROM device must
meet. Assuming that the device then behaves as does a standard CD-ROM
drive, Windows NT should be able to read from the CD-ROM drive as it would
from any ordinary CD-ROM drive.
<P>
In order to write to the CD-ROM drive in the Windows NT environment, a
CD-ROM mastering package compatible with Windows NT should be obtained.
