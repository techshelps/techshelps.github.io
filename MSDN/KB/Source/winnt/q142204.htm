The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Customers running Client Services for NetWare to access a Novell 3.11
server may intermittently receive incorrect volume information for
permanent drive mappings. Visible symptoms of this are File Manager showing
the directory information for the wrong volume while the Title Bar in File
Manager actually shows the correct volume path (for example, File Manager -
VOL1\Home may actually show the SYS\Apps directory).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
NetWare clients request directory search handles from a Novell Server for
Volumes it would like to reference or map. Novell contains support for
Temporary and Permanent directory search handles for volume mapping.
Permanent handles are maintained entirely by the client and should only be
terminated by the server when a new volume mapping is requested for the
same drive letter, or the client connection is terminated. The client
maintains the drive mapping by initially requesting a directory search
handle, maintaining a reference to it, and requesting that the handle be
deallocated when it is done.
<P>
Windows NT Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) maintains permanent directory
handles in a list of Volume Control Blocks (VCB's) per Server Connection
Block (SCB). CSNW frees a permanent directory handle when a VCB (mapping)
is freed, or when the owner SCB is marked as down. In the case that the SCB
is marked as down, CSNW actually changes the handle to 0xff indicating a
new directory search handle needs to be requested for this VCB when the SCB
is active again (the connection is re-established) -- like a ghosted
connection.
<P>
In this case, the Novell server loses track of permanent directory search
handles allocated by the Windows NT client. Traces of this problem have
shown no deallocation request for a particular permanent directory search
handle coming from the Windows NT client, and a debug dump of the VCB list
shows a duplicate handle ID is assigned to a new mapping from the Novell
server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
3.51.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the interoperation of
NetWare and Windows NT version 3.51. A workaround to this problem included
in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For information on
obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
