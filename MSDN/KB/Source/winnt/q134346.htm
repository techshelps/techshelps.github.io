The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft LAN Manager for MS-DOS, version 2.2c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using a diskless remoteboot workstation you cannot regain access
to your drive C after the following network error appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Net 808: Incorrect response from network

</PRE>This symptom occurs if the following conditions apply:

<UL><LI>Your workstation boots from a Windows NT 3.5 remoteboot server.
<LI>Your workstation is running LAN Manager for MS-DOS, version 2.2c.
<LI>Your workstation has at least one network connection to your remoteboot
   server in addition to the drive C connection.
<LI>Your remoteboot server has the AutoDisconnect parameter set to a value
   of greater than zero.
<LI>Your server's AutoDisconnect timer expired for your drive C connection.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two causes:

<UL><LI>Your remoteboot server incorrectly auto-disconnects your drive C without
   disconnecting your other network connection to the remoteboot server.

<LI>When you attempt to reconnect to your drive C, your workstation uses
   your computer remoteboot startup credentials (the computer name),
   instead of your logon name and password credentials.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT version 3.51 or obtain the
fix mentioned below.
<P>
To work around this problem:

<UL><LI>Set AutoDisconnect to a greater value on the remoteboot server.
   However, this only reduces the frequency of the problem; it does not
   eliminate it. To change the AutoDisconnect time value, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      net config server /autodisconnect:&lt;time&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;time&gt; is a number in the range of -1 to -65535 minutes. The
   default value for AutoDisconnect is 15, not -1 as stated in Help.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Set AutoDisconnect to -1 to never disconnect. This may not be a feasible
   option depending on how many remoteboot workstations you have per
   server.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A
fix to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested
and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not
recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information on the availability of this fix.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A diskless workstation can have two sets of credentials for connections to
the remoteboot Windows NT server.
<P>
When your workstation boots, it establishes a connection to the remoteboot
server using the workstation name as its user ID to get permission for
downloading its network software. This connection becomes your drive C.
<P>
After booting, you log on using the second set of credentials, that is your
user name and password, and establish connections using these credentials
to shared directories on the remoteboot server (with the Net Use command,
etc.). For example, you may connect drive H to your home directory located
on the remoteboot server.
<P>
If the remoteboot server has an AutoDisconnect setting of 15 minutes and
your workstation maintains network activity on drive H, but generates no
network traffic for 15 minutes on the remoteboot connection to your drive
C, the server disconnects drive C, but leaves drive H connected. As a
result you get the unrecoverable Net 808 error mentioned above when your
workstation attempts to access its disconnected drive C.
