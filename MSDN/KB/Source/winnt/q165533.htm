<P><h3>How to Troubleshoot Sysdiff Error Messages</h3>
 
<P>
Sysdiff uses the Windows error numbering system to report problems. To
determine the meaning of a Sysdiff error message, that is, to translate the
error number into a message, switch to an MS-DOS prompt and type the
following
<P>
<PRE>   NET HELPMSG &lt;number&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;number&gt; is the number of the Sysdiff error message.
<P>
For example, Sysdiff stops responding and the following error message
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   ERROR MESSAGE: SYSTEM ERROR 5

</PRE>When you type
<P>
<PRE>   NET HELPMSG 5

</PRE>at an MS-DOS prompt, the meaning of "System Error 5" appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Access is denied.

</PRE>When you use this same method to decode the error message "SYSTEM ERROR
32," the following information appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another
   process.

</PRE>In this way, you can decode the meaning of the error numbers.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Troubleshoot "Installation Failed" Applying .inf.</h3>
 
<P>
There are many causes for this error message. It is not the purpose of this
article to try to catalog all of them. This article shows you how to
determine exactly where the apply command is failing and explains some
general reasons for such failures.
<P>
The .inf file is created by the sysdiff /inf /m command and is
automatically placed in the $OEM$ directory. This file contains changes
that are to be made to the registry. It also tells you the version of
Sysdiff that was used to create it, the system root directory and the total
diff count.
<P>
The .inf file is executed sequentially, from the bottom up. To determine
where it has failed, it is necessary to open the file in a text editor
(like Notepad) beside the Registry Editor. Each line of the file, following
the [AddReg] section heading, represents a single change to the registry.
These are abbreviated; HKCR stands for HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, HKLM stands for
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, and so on.
<P>
Instead of starting at the bottom and working your way up, it might be
better to start at the middle and work your way out. Look at the line in
the .inf file and check the registry to see if that line was written. If it
was, move to the halfway mark between there and the end of the file until
you find a line that was not written. From there, locate the last line that
was written; this will show you the last thing Sysdiff successfully wrote
to the registry.
<P>
When sysdiff encounters an entry that it cannot write, it stops writing
from that point forward and reports the error message "installation
failed." Sysdiff will then prompt you to continue. Sysdiff will continue,
but all entries from that point forward are not written. Changes that are
made to .ini files are included in the [updateinis] section near the end of
the .inf file. If you suspect the problem is in updating .ini files,
comment out this section and see if Sysdiff will continue.
<P>
Debugging .inf files can be a time-consuming process. It is not, however,
necessary to do a full sysdiff /apply command to test it each time you
comment something out. Because all the Cmdlines.txt is doing is reading the
.inf file and writing each entry, you can configure it to do only that:

<OL><P><LI>Copy Cmdlines.txt and the .inf file from the $oem$ directory to the
   local Windows NT installation.

<P><LI>Copy Cmdlines.txt to a *.bat file (like GO.BAT).

<P><LI>Open the *.bat file in a text editor (like Notepad), delete the
   [Commands] heading and remove the quotation marks and save the changes.

<P><LI>Carry out the go.bat.
<P>
</OL>The above procedure is much faster than doing a full sysdiff /apply to
debug an error in the .inf file.
<P>
NOTE: Make certain that the \%windir%\system32 is in the environment path.
<P>
NOTE: Make certain that you do this to a computer that has already failed
in the installation. The main reason for verifying that this is done to a
failed installation as opposed to a clean install is that if the
application directories and .ini files do not exist, Sysdiff will always
return an error when it tries to write to files that are not there.
<P>
<P><h3>Behavior You Can Expect if the Problem Is a Bad .inf File</h3>
 

<UL><LI>When you double-click on an application, it starts, and then an
   hourglass appears and then goes away.

<LI>When you double-click on files in Windows Explorer,you get a message
   stating that there is no application associated with this file (even
   though you know that a .xls file belongs to Microsoft Excel, for
   example).

<LI>Programs do not appear in the Start menu but do appear on the hard disk
   drive. (This can also be due to forgetting the /m parameter on the
   sysdiff /inf command line).
<P>
<P>
</UL>Things that cause an inf to fail include:

<UL><LI>An attempt to write to a key that the current user no longer has
   access to or that Sysdiff cannot, by its nature, write to. An example
   of this is a failure to write to changes in the Boot.ini. Sysdiff cannot
   write to a read only file.

<LI>An attempt to write to a key that no longer exists.

<LI>Corrupted DIFF file (see below).
<P>
</UL><h3>What to Do if You Suspect a Corrupted Diff File</h3>
 
<P>
One of the problems with creating the snapshot, diff, and .inf file over
the network is network problems/bottlenecks. The diff file contains an
image of all of the files that have been added since the image file was
created. Creating this large a file over a network connection can leave you
wide open for data corruption.
<P>
A corrupted diff file may be the cause when you do everything Right, and
you verify the integrity of the .inf file (using the GO.BAT procedure
outlined above) but the apply still fails. Diff files are huge. If there
are any network bottlenecks at all, it is easy for these files to become
corrupted. To resolve this, try

<OL><P><LI>Create the snapshot, diff, and .inf files locally.

<P><LI>Manually copy the $oem$ file to the I386 share, then run the unattended
   installation.
