<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
On a multiprocessor computer, if you synchronize the system time to an
external time source using the Date/Time tool in Control Panel, and then
restart your system, the system time will be slow by four to five seconds
for every processor after the first processor.
<P>
Example:
<P>
If you set the time on a 4-processor system, the system time will be 12-15
seconds slow (3 x 4-5 seconds). Note that the time loss is not cumulative;
the system will still be slow by the same amount after another restart
unless the time is changed again.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During system initialization, the system starts by using only one
processor. The system time is retrieved from the system Real Time Clock
(RTC) and loaded into the system clock. Later in the initialization
process, the system clock timer is halted for four to five seconds while
each additional processor is configured. This halting causes a time slip
from the RTC value. When the time is written, it is written to both the
system clock and to the RTC.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, perform one of the following:

<UL><LI>Synchronize the system time with an external source and restart.
   Determine how much time the system lost during startup, and set the
   system time fast by this amount. After a restart, the time should be
   correct. You will need to repeat this procedure every time the system
   time is set.

<LI>Run the time service provided in the resource kit. This will keep a
   group of servers in sync with each other.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version
4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.

<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
