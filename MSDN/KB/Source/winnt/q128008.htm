The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOM</h2>
 
<P>
When you make a call with RAS from a computer running Windows NT 3.5 and
Client Services for NetWare (CSNW), you lose your connection to the local
NetWare server. If you are running applications from the local NetWare
server, and you have not saved your work, the data is lost. You cannot
browse or reconnect to local NetWare servers as long as the RAS IPXCP
connection exists.
<P>
These symptoms occur when the computer running Windows NT and CSNW has an
IPX session to a local Novell server and you connect to the RAS server
using PPP IPX (also called IPXCP) and the remote Windows NT 3.5 LAN also
has NetWare servers.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Two design limitations cause this problem:
<P>
By design, the list of Novell NetWare servers on a NetWare LAN is collected
by the servers and stored in their respective binderies. All NetWare client
redirectors query a single bindery to do name to address translation for
servers in that list. Therefore, a remote NetWare server accessed using RAS
does not have information in its bindery about the local NetWare LAN
servers, and vice versa.
<P>
Just like the Novell NetWare redirector, the Microsoft CSNW redirector is
not capable of connecting to disjointed NetWare networks simultaneously,
because it relies on the information in a single NetWare server bindery.
For the Netware server bindery to contain servers from the local and
remote NetWare LAN, Windows NT would need to be connected through an
internal IPX bridge that routes IPX. This feature is currently not
available.
<P>
Secondly, RAS on Windows NT 3.5 tells the Windows NT CSNW redirector to
automatically switch to the remote NetWare LAN, and in effect, drop the
local NetWare connection, if an IPXCP connection was successfully
negotiated between the RAS client and server.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To workaround this problem, ensure that Gateway Services for Netware is
installed on the RAS server. Instead of configuring RAS for PPP IPX
(protocol being IPXCP) configure the RAS client for NetBEUI (protocol being
NetBEUICP). Ensure the IPX option is unmarked. This will allow you to
access the remote NetWare servers while having a session to a local NetWare
server.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a
future release.
