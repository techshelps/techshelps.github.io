The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The Sound Blaster CD-ROM driver (MKECR5XX) that ships with Windows NT
is for accessing data, MIDI, and .WAV files only. It is not compatible
with either the Media Player (CD Audio option) or the CD Player
utilities provided with Windows NT and cannot play CD Audio files.
<P>
Neither the Sound Blaster Pro or the most prevalent CD-ROM drives that
accompany the sound card and its proprietary interface (Panasonic
CR-521 and the CR-561) support Multimedia (CD Audio) operation in
Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If a pure CD Audio disc is inserted and then you access it using the
Media Player or the CD Player, no sound or very low sound will be
heard. If you then insert a data disk and attempt to access the CD-ROM
from File Manager, an "Incorrect Function" error message appears on
the screen. Furthermore, if the computer is booted with a pure CD
Audio disc inserted, data functionality is lost at the outset of the
Windows NT session and the drive is either not recognized at all or,
if it is recognized, an "Incorrect Function" error message will still
appear when you attempt to access data. In either case, data
functionality is lost and the system must be rebooted to provide
access to the CD-ROM for data transfers.
<P>
A compact disc that has data, MIDI and .WAV files (such as MS
Bookshelf) will function correctly. These files can be accessed
through the Media Player or Sound Recorder by selecting the
appropriate media format from within the applet. A disc that has data,
MIDI, WAV and CD Audio files (such as MS Multimedia Beethoven)
function, but CD Audio files do not play.
<P>
NOTE: Attempting to play the CD Audio files on MS Beethoven does not
corrupt data functionality of the CD-ROM driver (MKECR5XX) like trying
to access a pure audio CD will do. The files just won't play.
