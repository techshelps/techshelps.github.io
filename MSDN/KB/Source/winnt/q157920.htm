The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform unattended installations using the Unattend.txt file, it
is possible to remove the Welcome To Windows NT splash screen that appears
after the initial installation, and after each new user logs on to the
computer. You can also use this procedure with attended installations.
This is useful if an administrator wants to prevent users from seeing this
splash screen.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To remove the Welcome To Windows NT splash screen, use one of the
following methods:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Copy all the Windows NT system files needed (usually the I386
   directory and all its subdirectories) from the Windows NT compact disc
   to the distribution server, which is a network share devoted to
   network client setup.

<P><LI>Create the Unattend.txt file with any parameters that you feel are
   necessary. In this method, there are no special entries that need to
   be made in the Unattend.txt file to remove the splash screen.
<P>
   For additional information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q155197.htm">Q155197</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Unattended Setup Parameters for Unattend.txt File

</PRE><P><LI>In the I386 directory (or the directory for the platform you are
   installing that you copied to the distribution server), change the
   name of the Welcome.ex_ file to Welcome.bak.

<P><LI>Back up the Txtsetup.sif file in the I386 directory to another file
   name, such as Txtsetup.bak.

<P><LI>Open the Txtsetup.sif file in Notepad. Use the Find command and search
   for the word "Welcome." There should be only one entry, and it should
   appear as the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      welcome.exe  = 1,,,,,,,1,0,0
</PRE>
<P><LI>Place a semicolon in front of this line. It should now look like:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ;welcome.exe  = 1,,,,,,,1,0,0
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the Txtsetup.sif file back to the distribution share.

<P><LI>Back up the Dosnet.inf file in the I386 directory to another file
   name, such as Dosnet.bak.

<P><LI>Open the Dosnet.inf file in Notepad. Use the Find command and search
   for the word "Welcome." There should be only one entry, and it should
   appear as the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      d1,welcome.exe
</PRE>
<P><LI>Place a semicolon in front of this line. It should now look like:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ;d1,welcome.exe
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save the Dosnet.inf file back to the distribution share and quit
   Notepad.

<P><LI>Run the setup routine for Microsoft Windows NT. The first time the
   administrator or any user logs on, the Welcome to Windows NT screen
   will no longer be presented.
<P>
   NOTE: The functionality of the Welcome to Windows NT splash screen
   can be enabled again. Copy the expanded Welcome.exe file to the
   %Systemroot%, log off, and then log back on. There is a registry entry
   that controls the operation of this executable file.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Copy all the Windows NT system files needed, usually the I386 directory
   and all its subdirectories from the compact disc to the distribution
   server, which is a network share devoted to network client setup. The
   directory name of this network share is usually also I386.

<P><LI>Create the Unattend.txt file with any parameters that you feel are
   necessary. In your Unattend.txt file, make sure Oempreinstall is set to
   Yes.
<P>
   For additional information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q155197.htm">Q155197</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Unattended Setup Parameters for Unattend.txt File

</PRE><P><LI>Create a directory named $oem$ under the I386 directory (the directory
   of the network share on the distribution server).

<P><LI>In the $oem$ directory, create a text file named Cmdlines.txt that
   contains the following two lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Commands]
      ".\regedit /s nowelc.reg"
</PRE>
<P><LI>Also in the $oem$ directory, create a text file named Nowelc.reg that
   contains the following six lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      REGEDIT4
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion
<PRE></PRE>          \Explorer\Tips]
      "DisplayInitialTipWindow"=dword:00000000
      "Show"=hex:00,00,00,00
      "Next"=hex:03,00

   NOTE: The second line is blank, but it must be present; line 3 above
   wraps to the next line for readability, but it should be all on one
   line in the Nowelc.reg file, with no spaces between CurrentVersion and
   \Explorer (that is, ...\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Tips]).

</PRE><P><LI>Place a copy of the Regedit.exe file (from the I386 directory) in the
   $oem$ directory. At this point, there should be three files in the
   $oem$ directory: Cmdlines.txt, Nowelc.reg, and Regedit.exe.

<P><LI>Run unattended setup for Windows NT 4.0.
