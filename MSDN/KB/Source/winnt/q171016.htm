The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0
- Routing and Remote Access Update
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Your Windows NT servers that are running the Routing and Remote Access
(RRAS) Update are not advertising subnet routes for your IP networks.
Instead, they are advertising one network route that summarizes the missing
subnets.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT routers are using a feature known as subnet hiding.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, use one of the following:

<UL><LI>Design the network so that all subnets of a particular network ID are
   contiguous. For example, if you have three subnets on one network ID and
   one subnet from a different network ID, the three that are on the same
   network ID must be neighbors of each other without being separated by
   the fourth segment.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the same network ID throughout your connections. Then the subnet
   routes will always be advertised.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use static routes or Open Shortest Path First (OSPF).
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The feature described above, subnet hiding, is expected behavior with RIP
version 1. RIP version 1 does not have a field for the subnet mask of a
network and does not support subnet advertisements. When advertising routes
to an external network that could not possibly know the subnet mask, the
subnetted routes are reduced to a single network route.
<P>
RIP version 2 is capable of advertising subnet masks; however, RIP version
2 may not advertise specific subnet routes when RIP version 1 routers could
mistake the routes as host routes. This would be the case if the RIP
version 1 router had a different network ID than the RIP version 2 router.
<P>
This behavior of subnet hiding is always done with RIP version 1 and is
usually done with RIP version 2. With some implementations of RIP version
2, subnet hiding can be enabled or disabled. Currently, the Routing and
Remote Access service cannot disable subnet hiding.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Routing and Remote Access
in Windows NT version 4.0 We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
