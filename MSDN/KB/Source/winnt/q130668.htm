<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Windows NT AT command to schedule a process that requires
a drive to be mapped to a NetWare volume (through Gateway or Client Service
for NetWare), the drives that are mapped by the scheduled process are not
accessible to any user or application except those started under the
scheduler service. Similarly, the scheduled process cannot access Netware
mapped drives that were not established by the scheduler service. If you
attempt to map that drive, the following message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   System Error 85: The local device name is already in use.

</PRE>If you attempt to delete the connection, an error message appears, stating
that the network connection could not be found.
<P>
The mapped drive does not show up as a valid drive in File Manager, but in
some cases it may show up in the disconnect network drive list from the
toolbar. If you try to disconnect that connection from within File Manager,
the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Access Denied

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The scheduled command or batch file that establishes the connection should
also terminate that connection by adding a NET USE &lt;drive&gt; /DELETE command
to the end of the file. The drive will be unusable for any other
application or process until the system is restarted if the drive is not
disconnected by the originating process.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
