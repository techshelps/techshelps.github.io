The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT
   Server 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If they are not configured properly, Remote Access Service (RAS) clients
may not have full network access when the RAS server is also an OSPF
router. This will only occur if OSPF is not properly configured and the
RAS IP address pool does not match the IP subnet of a LAN interface. Loss
of connectivity for LAN clients can also result if OSPF is not properly
configured.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
On an OSPF router, OSPF must be running for that interface to be included
in OSPF link state advertisements. In other words, if a particular
interface is not running OSPF, it is considered external and the route to
this network will not be advertised. RAS interfaces, as well as LAN
interfaces, can be considered external to OSPF. If RAS is using a pool of
IP addresses from a unique subnet, then a route to this subnet needs to be
advertised.
<P>
You will need to make this OSPF router an Autonomous System (AS) boundary
router (ASBR). Enabling this feature tells the router to advertise
external routes to the rest of the OSPF network. To enable this
functionality, right-click OSPF, click Configure OSPF By Bay Networks, and
then select the Enable Autonomous System Boundary Router check box.
<P>
When a router is an ASBR, it will advertise all routes including the
default gateway. For additional information, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q166170.htm">Q166170</A></B>
   TITLE     : Using Default Gateways with OSPF

</PRE>If RAS is using a pool of addresses that are within the same subnet as one
of the routers' OSPF interfaces, or you are using DHCP for the RAS address
pool, you need not do anything. In this case, the subnet is already being
advertised and RAS will use Proxy ARP to get packets to the RAS clients.
