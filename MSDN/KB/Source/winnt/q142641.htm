The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
On your computer running the TCP/IP protocol and connected to the
Internet, some or all network services are rendered unavailable and error
messages such as the following appear on the network client screen:
<P>
<PRE>   The connection has been reset by the remote host.

</PRE>This symptom of all network services being rendered unavailable may also
occur on a computer running an operating system other than Windows NT, for
example, UNIX.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Your computer has become the target of a malicious attack known as TCP/IP
"SYN Flooding" or "SYN Attacks."
<P>
"Computer hackers" can target an entire machine, or a specific TCP service
such as web services. The attack is focused on the TCP protocol used by
all computers on the Internet, and is not specific to the Windows NT
operating system.
<P>
<P><h3>How SYN Flooding Works</h3>
 
<P>
SYN Flooding works as follows: (see also CERT(sm) Advisory CA-96.21 at
<B>ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories)</B>

<UL><LI>A TCP connection request (SYN) is sent to the target computer. The
   source IP address in the packet is "spoofed," or replaced with an
   address that is not in use on the Internet, or that belongs to another
   computer. An attacker will send many of these TCP SYNs to tie up as
   many resources as possible on the target computer.

<LI>Upon receiving the connection request, the target computer allocates
   resources to handle and track the new connection, then responds with a
   "SYN-ACK". In this case, the response is sent to the "spoofed" non-
   existent IP address.

<LI>No response is received to the SYN-ACK. A default-configured Windows NT
   3.5x or 4.0 computer will retransmit the SYN-ACK 5 times, doubling the
   time-out value after each retransmission. The initial time-out value is
   three seconds, so retries are attempted at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48
   seconds. After the last retransmission, 96 seconds are allowed to pass
   before the computer gives up on receiving a response, and deallocates
   the resources that were set aside earlier for the connection. The total
   elapsed time that resources are in use is 189 seconds.
<P>
</UL><h3>How to Verify Your Computer is Under a SYN Attack</h3>
 
<P>
If you suspect that your computer is the target of a SYN attack, you can
type the following command at a command prompt to view connections in the
"SYN_RECEIVED" state:
<P>
<PRE>   netstat -n -p tcp

</PRE>This command may cause the following text to appear on your screen:
<P>
<PRE>   Active Connections

      Proto  Local Address         Foreign Address       State
      TCP    127.0.0.1:1030        127.0.0.1:1032        ESTABLISHED
      TCP    127.0.0.1:1032        127.0.0.1:1030        ESTABLISHED
      TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1256     SYN_RECEIVED
      TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1257     SYN_RECEIVED
      TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1258     SYN_RECEIVED
      TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1259     SYN_RECEIVED
      TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1260     SYN_RECEIVED
      TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1261     SYN_RECEIVED
      TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1262     SYN_RECEIVED
      TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1263     SYN_RECEIVED
      TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1264     SYN_RECEIVED
      TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1265     SYN_RECEIVED
      TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1266     SYN_RECEIVED
      TCP    10.57.8.190:4801      10.57.14.221:139      TIME_WAIT

</PRE>If a large number of connections are in the SYN_RECEIVED state, it is
possible that the system is under attack. A network analyzer can be used
to track the problem down further, and it may be necessary to contact your
Internet Service Provider for assistance in attempting to trace the
source.
<P>
The effect of tying up connection resources varies, depending upon the
TCP/IP stack and applications listening on the TCP port. For most stacks,
there is a limit on the number of connections that can be in the half-open
(SYN_RECEIVED) state. Once the limit is reached for a given TCP port, the
target computer responds with a reset to all further connection requests
until resources are freed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the following update for Windows NT 3.51 or the latest Service Pack
for Windows NT 4.0
<P>
Microsoft is committed to providing the best possible protection against
these attacks from within the Windows NT operating system and has made a
number of changes to its TCP/IP components available to customers in
response to this threat.
<P>
The changes in the update can be applied individually, or all at once, as
deemed necessary.
<P>
The changes are listed here:
<P>
*******************************************************************
<PRE>*  1. Tcpip.sys times out half-open connections faster            *
</PRE>*******************************************************************
<P>
A new version of Tcpip.sys has been produced that allows control of the
number of times a response to a TCP connection request (SYN-ACK) will be
retransmitted. Control is handled through a new registry parameter:
<P>
<PRE>  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  \SYSTEM
   \CurrentControlSet
    \Services
     \Tcpip
      \Parameters
       \TcpMaxConnectResponseRetransmissions
           Value Type: REG_DWORD
           Valid Range: 0-0xFFFFFFFF
           Default: 3

</PRE>The default value for this parameter is now 3. The following table shows
Windows NT 4.0 TCP/IP behavior for various values of this parameter:
<P>
<PRE>Value  Retransmission Times   Elapsed Time  Comments
</PRE> 
<PRE>3      3, 6, and 12 seconds   45 seconds    Cleanup 24 secs after last
retx
2      3, and 6 seconds       21 seconds    Cleanup 12 secs after last
retx
1      3 seconds              9  seconds    Cleanup 6  secs after last
retx

</PRE>This parameter changes the default time that it takes to clean up a half-
open TCP connection from 189 seconds to 45 seconds, and provides more
granular control to the administrator. A site that is under heavy attack
might set the value as low as "1". A value of "0" is also valid; however
if this parameter is set to 0, SYN-ACKs will not be retransmitted at all,
and will time out in 3 seconds. With the value this low, legitimate
connection attempts from distant clients may fail.
<P>
*******************************************************************
<PRE>*  2. NetBT has a Higher, Configurable Backlog                    *
</PRE>*******************************************************************
<P>
NetBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP) uses TCP port 139 and is used by Microsoft
Network Services such as file and print sharing. Version 3.51 and 4.0
NetBT has a "backlog" of connection blocks available that is two plus an
incremental number depending on the NetBT clients (such as the redirector,
server, and any NetBIOS applications running). On a typical server, this
number will be 7-11. A new version of NetBT has been produced that
automatically allocates more connection blocks as needed, in a
configurable manner.
<P>
On a connection event, it now checks to see if the number of free blocks
is below 2, and if so, adds an "increment" number of blocks, where
"increment" is configurable in the registry as shown here:
<P>
<PRE>  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  \SYSTEM
   \CurrentControlSet
    \Services
     \NetBt
      \Parameters
       \BacklogIncrement
           Value Type: REG_DWORD
           Valid Range: 1-0x14  (1-20 decimal)
           Default: 3

</PRE>Each connection block consumes 78 bytes of memory. The total number of
connection blocks that can be allocated by NetBT is also registry
configurable:
<P>
<PRE>  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  \SYSTEM
   \CurrentControlSet
    \Services
     \NetBt
      \Parameters
       \MaxConnBackLog
           Value Type: REG_DWORD
           Valid Range: 1-0x9c40 (1-40,000 decimal)
           Default: 1000

</PRE>MaxConnBackLog defaults to 1000, but can be set as high as 40,000.
Connection blocks are "scavenged," or recycled, when the SYN-ACK
retransmission timer expires and TCP fails the connection attempt.
<P>
*******************************************************************
<PRE>*  3. Afd.sys has been modified to withstand large numbers of     *
*     "half-open" connections efficiently                         *
</PRE>*******************************************************************
<P>
Windows Sockets applications such as ftp servers and web servers have
their connection attempts handled by Afd.sys. Afd.sys has been modified to
support large numbers of connections in the "half-open" state without
denying access to legitimate clients. This is accomplished by allowing the
administrator to configure a dynamic backlog.
<P>
The new version of Afd.sys supports four new registry parameters that
can be used to control the dynamic backlog behavior.
<P>
EnableDynamicBacklog is a global switch to enable or disable dynamic
backlog. It defaults to 0 (off), and this setting provides no change from
the existing versions. Setting it to 1 enables the new dynamic backlog
feature.
<P>
<PRE>  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  \SYSTEM
   \CurrentControlSet
    \Services
     \AFD
      \Parameters
       \EnableDynamicBacklog
           Value Type: REG_DWORD
           Valid Range: 0,1
           Default: 0
           Suggested value for a system under heavy attack: 1

</PRE>MinimumDynamicBacklog controls the minimum number of free connections
allowed on a listening endpoint. If the number of free connections drops
below this value, then a thread is queued to create additional free
connections. This value should not be made too large, as the dynamic
backlog code engages whenever the number of free connections falls below
this value. Too large a value may lead to a performance reduction.
<P>
<PRE>  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  \SYSTEM
   \CurrentControlSet
    \Services
     \AFD
      \Parameters
       \MinimumDynamicBacklog
           Value Type: REG_DWORD
           Valid Range: 0-0xFFFFFFFF
           Default: 0
           Suggested value for a system under heavy attack: 20

</PRE>MaximumDynamicBacklog controls the maximum number of "quasi-free"
connections allowed on a listening endpoint. "Quasi-free" connections
include the number of free connections plus those connections in a half-
connected (SYN_RECEIVED) state. No attempt is made to create additional
free connections if doing so would exceed this value.
<P>
<PRE>  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  \SYSTEM
   \CurrentControlSet
    \Services
     \AFD
      \Parameters
       \MaximumDynamicBacklog
           Value Type: REG_DWORD
           Valid Range: 0-0xFFFFFFFF
           Default: 0
           Suggested value for a system under heavy attack: Memory
           dependent. This value should not exceed 5000 for each 32 MB of
           RAM installed in the server, in order to prevent exhaustion of
           non-paged pool when under attack.

</PRE>DynamicBacklogGrowthDelta controls the number of free connections to
create when additional connections are necessary. Be careful with this
value, as a large value could lead to explosive free connection
allocations.
<P>
<PRE>  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  \SYSTEM
   \CurrentControlSet
    \Services
     \AFD
      \Parameters
       \DynamicBacklogGrowthDelta
           Value Type: REG_DWORD
           Valid Range: 0-0xFFFFFFFF
           Default: 0
           Suggested value for a system under heavy attack: 10 (0xa)
</PRE>MaximumDynamicBacklog,
free
<P>
To take advantage of the changes to Afd.sys, Windows Sockets applications
must specifically request a backlog greater than the value configured for
MinimumDynamicBacklog when they issue their listen() call. Microsoft
applications such as Internet Information Server (which has a default
backlog of 25) are configurable. Application-specific details are
available from the Microsoft Knowledgebase at <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/kb">http://www.microsoft.com/kb.</A></B>
<P>
The modified drivers for Windows NT and instructions for installing them
are available from Microsoft support channels or directly from the
following Internet locations:

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed the TCP/IP protocol in Windows NT versions 3.51
and 4.0 to be vulnerable to these attacks.
