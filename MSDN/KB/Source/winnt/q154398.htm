The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The NetLogon service fails to start on a backup domain controller (BDC)
with NetLogon error 3210 or 5721, whereas, in the system event logs of the
primary domain controller (PDC) the NetLogon service logs errors 5722 or
5723.
<P>
This problem appears to be random and may occur on several BDCs. If you
remove the BDC computer account and synchronize the BDC with the PDC, the
problem is solved until the NetLogon service is restarted on the PDC.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When NetLogon starts on PDC, it enumerates all computer accounts and for
each BDC builds a structure that is used to establish the secure channel.
NetLogon enumerates a maximum of 250 accounts on each call to the SAM, but
due to a problem in NetLogon, NetLogon is missing one account between each
set of 250. If that account is a workstation account, you do not experience
any problems. However, if that account is a BDC account, you experience the
problem mentioned above.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix below, or wait for the next
service pack.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For each BDC, there is a discrete communication channel (the secure
channel) with the PDC. The secure channel is used by the NetLogon service
on the BDC and on the PDC in order to communicate.
<P>
When a BDC is part of a domain, a computer account is created (the computer
account can be seen with Server Manager.) A default password is given to
the computer account and the BDC stores the password in LSA secret storage
$machine.acc.
<P>
Each BDC maintains such an LSA secret, which is used by the NetLogon
service in order to establish a secure channel.
<P>
The problem described above is not related to the secure channel's
password. The NetLogon service fails to start on the BDC even though the
BDC computer's account password and BDC secret $machine.acc are
synchronized. This can be checked with NETDOM utility provided with Windows
NT 4.0 Resource Kit Supplement 2 by running the following command on the
BDC:
<P>
<PRE>   netdom bdc \\bdcname /query

</PRE>The output looks similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   NetDom 1.2 @1997.
   Querying domain information on computer \\BDCNAME ...
   The computer \\BDCNAME is a domain controller of DOMAIN.
   Searching PDC for domain DOMAIN ...
   Found PDC \\PDCNAME
   Verifying secure channel on \\BDCNAME ...
   Verifying the computer account on the PDC \\PDCNAME ...
   Secure channel checked successfully.

</PRE>NOTE: If you receive the error message below, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   The computer account for \\BDCNAME doesn't exist or has an invalid
   password.

   TITLE     : NetLogon Service Fails when Secure Channel Not Functioning

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
