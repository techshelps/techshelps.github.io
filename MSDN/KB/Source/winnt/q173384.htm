<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Deleting the %SystemRoot%\Repair folder from a Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0
Server or Workstation installation produces the following problems:

<UL><LI>You cannot install a Windows NT Service Pack.
<P>
   When you run the Update program from the Windows NT service pack you
   receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Service Pack Setup could not find the Setup.log file in your repair
      directory.
</PRE><P>
   The Update program will not continue.

<LI>You cannot create an Emergency Repair Disk.
<P>
   When you run Rdisk to update and create an Emergency Repair Disk, it
   fails with the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Repair Disk Utility could not copy all files to the Emergency Repair
      Disk. One or more files were not found.
</PRE><P>
   This error occurs after the update option has finished copying the
   following files to the newly created repair folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Autoexec.nt
      Config.nt
      ntuser.da_ New user profile (V4.0 only)
      Software._ Software Registry hive
<PRE></PRE>      System._   System Registry hive

</PRE></UL>The following files are missing from the repair folder and are
necessary for a good Emergency Repair Disk.
<P>
<PRE>     Sam._      Sam Registry hive
     Security._ Security hive
     Default._  Default user profile
     SETUP.LOG file
