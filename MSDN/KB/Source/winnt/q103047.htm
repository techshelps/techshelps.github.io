The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you do not add network services to Windows NT during installation,
you can add them after setup by running the network applet in Control
Panel and choosing the YES button when presented with the option to
install networking.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If there are no network components currently installed, running the
network applet in Control Panel will present the user with a dialog
box which reads:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows NT Networking is not installed, install it now?

</PRE>If the YES button is chosen, the network installation portion of the
setup program will be started and a full network setup will run,
including automatic network adapter detection and installation of all
standard network software. This network installation can be forced by
simply removing all network software and network adapter drivers from
Control Panel, restarting the computer, and following the above
procedure. This can be useful if some necessary network drivers have
been removed but the user is not sure which ones need to be replaced.
<P>
Note that interrupting the installation process after starting it as
described above will result in a partial network installation that is
best recovered by removing all network software listed in the network
applet of Control Panel, restarting the computer, and restarting the
network setup process.
