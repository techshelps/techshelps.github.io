The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An updated version of Dns.exe is available to fix the following problems:

<UL><LI>A lookup for a non-existent A record takes about 30 seconds to time out:
   When the internal DNS server is queried, it goes to the root server. If
   the root server returns an RCODE of 0, the Microsoft DNS server does not
   respond to its client immediately. Some versions of BIND may return an
   RCODE of 0. This can cause a 30 second delay at the querying client.

<LI>Problem resolving some MX records: If a DNS client does a recursive
   query to the Microsoft DNS server for an MX record and the authoritative
   DNS server for that MX record returns an SOA record instead (because the
   MX record doesn't exist), the Microsoft DNS server does not return that
   SOA record to the client. A BIND DNS server does return the SOA record
   to the DNS client even though it requested an MX record. Microsoft has
   modified its DNS service to be compatible with BIND.

<LI>BIND incompatibility: When the Microsoft DNS service receives a query
   for a name that requires an authoritative lookup, and the DNS server
   handling the lookup is a BIND server, it may respond with a CNAME
   record, causing the name server (NS) record for the BIND server to be
   overwritten in cache. The NS record is used to specify the authoritative
   name server for a domain.

<LI>When using the new WriteAuthorityNs reg key that was added in Windows NT
   4.0 SP3 DNS, DNS queries will always return authority records=0 and
   additional=0 instead the actual count for this.

<LI>If you delegate a zone (such as mydepartment.mycompany.com) to a DNS
   server that is not in the zone (such as
   yourserver.yourdepartment.company.com), when a client does a lookup on a
   host in the delegated zone, it will not succeed. If you ping the server
   that the zone was delegated to (yourserver.yourdepartment.company.com)
   once so that it is cached, lookups will start to succeed. The problem
   was caused by a problem following the glue record that was associated
   with the delegation, and it has been fixed.

<LI>Access Violation in Dns.exe: Dr Watson may report an access violation on
   a secondary DNS server when it is receiving invalid records from the
   primary, and the data changes on the primary from the initial zone
   transfer.
<P>
</UL>Other updates and optimizations:

<UL><LI>Reduced traffic to root servers: This version eliminates the automatic
   root query on startup and in the timeout thread; instead, it queries the
   root only when it receives a query that needs to be sent to the root
   servers, and limits retrying the root servers to once every ten minutes.

<LI>Better recursion response: This version supports direct forwarding of a
   response from the remote DNS, where possible.

<LI>Eliminates a deadlock condition hit by a few customers. At least one
   person posting on the MS-DNS newsgroup reported hitting a deadlock. The
   symptom of this is that the server stops responding to all requests.

<LI>Better use of SOA in authority section: This version still has an
   optimization to avoid this on local queries, but overall should be a
   more "friendly" partner for remote DNS servers when sending a NAME_ERROR
   or no-records response.

<LI>Local network prioritization of queries: If there are multiple A
   records, this version of the server puts the one that "fits best" first;
   if none fits best, a straight round robin scheme is followed. This is on
   by default but can be turned off with the new LocalNetPriority registry
   flag:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: LocalNetPriority
      Data Type : REG_DWORD
<PRE></PRE>      Data      : 0 or 1 (0 is disabled)

      NOTE: This key does not exist by default.

   For more information see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q177883.htm">Q177883</A></B>
      TITLE     : DNS Server Stops Using Round Robin for Host Name
                  Resolution

</PRE><LI>WildcardAllTypes registry flag: If on, this version of DNS will use
   wildcards on all types -- even where they make no sense; this was added
   for a specific customer scenario where it is used for a security check
   using reverse lookup.

<LI>Cache pollution fix: There was a recently-publicized problem where a
   remote DNS returned bogus data, polluting the cache of DNS servers on
   the Internet. This was used to point some traffic that would normally go
   to InterNIC sites to another site. This release plugs that hole. All
   data received must be for names at or below the zone for which the NS is
   queried. For example, when you query the microsoft.com DNS server, you
   will accept any data for microsoft.com or ntdev.microsoft.com but will
   reject any data for someothersite.com.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next
Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   10/29/97  04:32p               160,016 Dns.exe (Intel)
   10/29/97  04:29p               269,584 Dns.exe (Alpha)

</PRE>NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to Windows NT 4.0 prior to applying
this fix.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The hotfix mentioned above, may experience some problems as specified
below:

<UL><LI>Local network prioritization of queries may cause Round-Robin load
   balancing to fail. If you experience this problem turn off the
   LocalNetPriority flag as mentioned above.

<LI>High Speed Zone Transfers
   The default configuration now always attempts to include multiple
   records in each transaction. This may cause BIND 4.9.4 and older DNS
   Servers to be unable to receive zone transfers. If you experience this
   problem set the BindSecondaries flag to use slower transfers:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: BindSecondaries
      Data Type : REG_DWORD
<PRE></PRE>      Data      : 0 or 1 (0 = high speed; 1 = slower transfers)

   NOTE: This key does not exist by default. Transfers between Microsoft
   DNS Servers will always be done with using the faster, high compression
   method, regardless of how the BindSecondaries flag is set. After
   changing this registry key, you must stop and restart the DNS Server
   service.
