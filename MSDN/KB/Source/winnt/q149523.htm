The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows NT versions 3.5 and 3.51, if you try to connect to an
administrative share as a regular domain user without any special
privileges, you will receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Access is Denied.

</PRE>In Windows NT version 3.5, if you try to connect to an administrative share
as a member of the Server Operators group, you will be connected with full
control.
<P>
In Windows NT version 3.51, if you try to connect to an administrative
share as a member of the Server Operators group, you will be able to
connect to the share and a drive will be mapped to the share in file
manager but you will not have access to the share.  The left side of the
screen in File Manager will show the path to the administrative share and
the right side which, usually displays the available files will show:
<P>
<PRE>   You do not have permission to access this directory.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
On page 471 of the System Guide, C$ and ADMIN$ shares are discussed. The
guide says that only members of the Administrators, Backup Operators, and
Server Operators groups can connect to these shares.
<P>
The documentation is correct in saying that these users can connect to
these shares but fails to elaborate that the Server Operators members can
not access the files in these shares.  The access to the administrative
shares has been minimized by default to make the network more secure.
Backup Operators retain permission to access files in these
administrative shares, based on the assumption that backing up the data in
these administrative shares is a critical function.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, complete the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Log on as an administrator.
</OL>2. Go into File Manager and highlight the share you want to give Server
<PRE>   Operators permissions to.
</PRE></OL>3. Choose 'Disk' from the toolbar menu and select 'Share As...'
4. In the Shared Directory dialogue box, select the 'New Share' button.
<PRE>   Enter the share name, path, and comment.
</PRE>5. Select the 'Permissions...' button. Add the Server Operators group and
<PRE>   grant its members full control. Remove the group Everyone.

</PRE>The Server Operators will now be able to access this share with the share
name you specified.
