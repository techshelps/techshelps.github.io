<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Event Viewer located in Administrative Tools, the event
viewer may display different description information under Event Details
for the same event ID number. This problem occurs when either viewing an
event log of a remote computer or viewing a log file saved from a different
computer locally.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When an event is triggered in Windows NT, the event ID is written to the
log file, not the event description. Because of updated ERROR_CODEs and
improvements to Windows NT through service packs, the order and
description codes have changed.
<P>
When an event is triggered in Windows NT, the ID number of the event is
written to the log file to minimize the size of the log file, the text
description corresponding to the ID is not written to the log file but is
looked up in a .dll file when the event is opened. The .dll file that is
used is dependent on the event. As a result, when the event viewer is run,
a lookup of the event ID is referenced locally and the appropriate event ID
text is displayed. This can cause an event to have multiple meanings
according to the versions of the system and event log that is running.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid inconsistent error messages when reading the event log of a remote
computer, make sure all systems match according to version number and
service pack level. This can be verified by running WINMSD from within
Windows NT and selecting Version.
