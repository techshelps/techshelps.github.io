The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may encounter corrupt files if Windows NT is installed on a FAT
partition or shared CDFS volume that has a file system filter driver
running on that volume.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by Memory Descriptor List (MDL) interactions between
the Cache Manager, the SMB server, the file system filter driver, and FAT.
There is an error in the Windows NT Cache Manager that may cause data
corruption when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>Windows NT file server (Srv.sys) is running and sharing data on a local
   FAT-based file system (Fastfat.sys).
<P>
   NOTE: This problem does not occur if the server is sharing data on NTFS
   systems. However, the problem may exist with other third-party file
   systems or other code that exercises MDL I/O in ways similar to Srv.sys.

<LI>Windows NT is using a file system filter driver. The filter driver must
   be aware of the Fast MDL routines and it must filter I/O on the
   FAT-based file system.
<P>
   For more information on file system filter drivers, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q168513.htm">Q168513</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Windows NT Installable File System Kit (IFS) Description

   NOTE: Windows NT 4.0 does not include any file system filter drivers.

</PRE></UL>For example, when a filter driver filters data I/O on an SMB server, which
is shared on a FAT file system, the I/O requests that flow from the network
system through the server, to the filter driver, and into the FAT partition
may cause data corruption.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
An updated version of the Windows NT kernel (which includes Cache Manager)
no longer ignores returns from the filter driver that indicate the filter
did not write the data or free the MDL. Cache Manager now takes system-
defined default actions. To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix
or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   06/27/97  06:35p               934,208 Ntkrnlmp.exe (Intel)
   06/27/97  06:34p               914,816 Ntoskrnl.exe (Intel)

   06/27/97  05:34p             1,393,600 Ntkrnlmp.exe (Alpha)
   06/27/97  05:34p             1,366,144 Ntoskrnl.exe (Alpha)

</PRE>NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to Windows NT 4.0 prior to applying
this fix.
<P>
You can work around this problem by using NTFS partitions for SMB
server-based shares instead of FAT partitions or by not using any file
system filter drivers that filter I/O on top of FAT-based server volumes.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
