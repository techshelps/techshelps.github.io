<P><h3>Microsoft Clarifies Position on Support for Customers Deploying NDS for NT</h3>
 
<P>
Recently, there have been a lot of questions regarding Microsoft's support
for its Windows NT Server customers who deploy NDS for NT from Novell.
Microsoft is committed to providing support for our customers. Any customer
that uses NDS for NT can expect full support for Windows NT Server code
from Microsoft. However, NDS for NT replaces an internal piece of the
Windows NT Server operating system related to the directory and security
portion of the system. Customers who need support for NDS on NT should
contact Novell if their problems concern security and directory.
<P>
Customers should be aware that deploying NDS for NT could lead to
significant implications, including:

<UL><LI>Support and reliability: Novell is replacing an internal system DLL
   (samsrv.dll), this DLL is critical in that it implements a key part
   of the directory and security infrastructure in Windows NT Server.
   This DLL is part of the Trusted Computing Base and it was
   specifically designed to not be replaced except by Microsoft to pass
   C2/E3 and other security tests. Microsoft has been enhancing the
   functionality of this module in virtually all Service Packs. For
   example, Service Pack 3 for Windows NT 4.0 contains changes that are
   not reflected in Novell's replacement of this DLL. The next Service
   Pack also updates this file.
<P>
   NOTE: Previously, Microsoft incorrectly stated that two DLLs were
   replaced in Windows NT Server by NDS for NT. This was accurate in the
   beta from Novell, but with the final release of NDS for NT only one DLL
   is replaced in Windows NT Server.

<LI>Upgrading to future releases of Windows NT Server: Because NDS for NT
   replaces an internal part of the operating system, servers with NDS
   for NT installed will not upgrade to Windows NT Server 5.0 correctly
   (e.g., if any new local users have been created). The automatic
   upgrade to Windows NT Server 5.0 uses internal database information
   to do the upgrade which is not available once NDS for NT is
   installed.
<P>
</UL>While Microsoft understands that Novell is trying to solve a very difficult
problem-easing directory management-NDS for NT is not an interoperability
solution because it doesn't maintain the state of both directory systems.
NDS for NT forces customers to replace a critical internal piece of
security code on every Windows NT Server operating as a domain controller.
It is an NDS only solution. Customers want interoperability that enables
any new client to communicate with any existing server and any existing
client to communicate with any new server without replacing any code on the
existing systems.
<P>
Was there another approach for directory management that could have been
used?
 
<P>
If Novell wanted to deliver an interoperability solution that works with
what customers already have deployed, Novell could have built a directory
synchronization tool using the published Active Directory Service
Interfaces (ADSI). ADSI, the industry standard for accessing directory
services from any vendor, allows third party developers such as Novell to
integrate their solutions into the Windows NT Directory Service. This, too,
would have allowed Novell to synchronize the two directory services without
replacing Windows NT Server code and then manage both directories from NDS.
<P>
This solution would have been better for customers because it would allow
both systems to coexist without forcing customers to replace what they
already have. In fact, Microsoft's strategy with Windows NT Server 5.0 and
Active Directory is to deliver an NDS directory synchronization tool
through native support for NDS protocols, a solution that will allow
customers to manage their mixed environments from Active Directory.
Customers can be assured that this solution will not require them to
replace any code on their NetWare servers. And, it will allow them to
continue to leverage their investment in NDS.
