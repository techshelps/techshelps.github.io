The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT 4.0 imports Domain Name Service (DNS) information from boot
files into the registry when data is modified using DNS Manager. However,
after it is there, the information is maintained and updated only in the
registry. If data is changed using DNS Manager, the information is not
written back to the original boot file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has designed a hotfix for the DNS service that causes it to
automatically write back to boot files any changes in the registry that
affect information stored in boot files (such as new zones, change files,
change zone types, change master, change forwarders, and so on).
<P>
This fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   06/10/97  06:09p              198,928 dns.exe (Alpha)
   06/10/97  04:37p              119,568 dns.exe (Intel)

</PRE>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
If you want to enable Windows NT to store and track DNS information in boot
files, apply the above hotfix and use Registry Editor to delete the value
EnableRegistryBoot from following key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters

</PRE>You can now replace your desired boot file in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Dns
folder. During startup, the DNS service now reads from the boot file first,
overriding any settings in the registry. After the boot file has been
processed, secondary information not found in the boot file is loaded from
the registry (secondary security, notify lists, forwarding timeouts, listen
IP list, and so on).
<P>
WARNING: Initially, when you configure Windows NT to read and write DNS
settings to the boot files, any changes made in the registry through DNS
Manager that are not present in the boot files are lost. After making the
above registry change, all new changes made through DNS Manager are written
to the boot files.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
