The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Zero Administration Kit for Windows NT Workstation 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to install and run some programs on a Windows NT Zero 
Administration Kit (ZAK) client workstation, even though you should be 
restricted from doing so. You may be able to do this by installing 
programs to and running them from the folder defined in the TEMP user 
variable (the temporary folder). In a ZAK client workstation, the default
temporary folder is C:\Temp.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The temporary folder is not restricted on ZAK client workstations because 
many programs, including Microsoft Office, do not function properly if the
temporary folder is restricted.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this issue, you can configure the policy file for the ZAK 
client workstation to allow only specific programs to run. The policy file
resides on the ZAK server and can be modified by using the following 
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Log on to the ZAK server (this is the primary domain controller for the
   network) as the domain administrator.

<P><LI>Start Policy Editor (Poledit.exe), and then open the Ntconfig.pol file
   in the following folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      %SystemRoot%\System32\Repl\Import\Scripts
</PRE>
<P><LI>Double-click the user icon for the ZAK client user, double-click
   System, and then double-click Restrictions. Click the Run Only Allowed
   Windows Applications check box to select it.

<P><LI>Click Show, click Add, type the executable file name of the program you
   want to allow the ZAK client user to run, and then click OK. Repeat
   this procedure for every program you want the user to be able to run.
<P>
   For example, to allow the ZAK client to run Microsoft Word, type
   "winword.exe" (without the quotation marks) as the allowed program. To
   determine the executable file names, view the shortcuts on the Start
   menu of the ZAK client in the Netapps folder on the ZAK server.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Save the file, and then quit Policy Editor.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here 
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
