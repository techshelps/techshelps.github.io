The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following article discusses how to create mandatory profiles for
Windows NT version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create a mandatory profile for Windows NT 4.0, perform the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a user called "Template" who will have the same privileges and
   rights as the users in the group for which you are creating the
   mandatory profile. (This step is very important so that you do not have
   conflicting permissions while setting up shares, programs, and so on.)

<P><LI>Log on to the computer running Windows NT Workstation as the new
   Template user and set up the profile (set up the desktop, install
   applications, and so on) to your specifications and log off the
   computer. The profile will not be created until you log off.

<P><LI>Log back on to the computer running Windows NT Workstation as a user
   with administrator privileges on the local workstation as well as on the
   domain and start the System tool in Control Panel. Select the User
   Profiles tab.

<P><LI>Highlight the profile for your Template user and select Copy To. In the
   Copy To dialog box, you will need to specify where you want to copy the
   profile and who is permitted to use it.
<P>
   a. Under the Permitted To Use section of this dialog box, click Change
<P><PRE>      and select the user or group who will be permitted to use this
      profile.
</PRE><P>
   b. Next, you will need to specify where you want to COPY PROFILE TO. For
<P><PRE>      a server based mandatory profile, you will need to specify the
      following information:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         \\ServerName\Sharename\Name of Profile

      For example, \\PENDRAGON1\Profiles\mandatory.

   If you are using mandatory profiles, go to step 5; otherwise, go to
   step 6.

</PRE><P><LI>Windows NT 4.0 has implemented two levels of security in mandatory
   profiles.
<P>
   The first level is to rename the Ntuser.dat file to .man. This will
   allow the users of a mandatory profile to log on to the domain using
   cached information, if the profile is unavailable on the central server.
<P>
   a. The steps to implement the first level of mandatory security:
<P><PRE>      Change the user's profile path in user manager to reflect the
      mandatory profile.
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         \\servername\sharename\profilename

     Rename the Ntuser.dat to Ntuser.man under the profile directory

   The second level is to add a .MAN extension on the directory name. When
   using the .man extension, if the profile is unavailable, the workstation
   will not log the user on and it will return to the CTRL+ALT+DELETE logon
   screen.

   b. The steps in getting the second level of security are:

      1) Add .man extension to profile path in user manager:

            \\servername\sharename\profilename.man

      2) Add .man extension to server based profile DIRECTORY and the
         Ntuser.dat file needs to be renamed to Ntuser.man

</PRE><P><LI>Click OK to copy the profile to where you have specified. Open Windows
   NT explorer and connect to the path where you have copied the profile.
   Open the directory and rename the Ntuser.dat to Ntuser.man. This will
   prevent users from being able to modify the profile. If this is not
   renamed, it will not function as a mandatory profile.

<P><LI>In User Manager for Domains, select the users you want to use the
   mandatory profile and in the properties for each user, select Profile
   and specify the path to where the mandatory profile exists in the User
   Profile Path box. This must be a UNC path so it must be in the form of
   \\Server\Share\Profile (all users who are going to be using this profile
   must have at least read access to the root share and the profile
   folder).

<P><LI>Test by logging on to the workstation as another user who has just been
   granted the mandatory profile.
