The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An application which periodically starts Command Prompt commands or
utilities (32-bit applications) may exhibit symptoms of a memory resource
allocation problem. To observe this problem, you can use Performance
Monitor to view nonpaged pool memory. The application in question regularly
allocates more and more nonpaged pool memory until system memory resources
are exhausted. This can result in poor system performance and disk
"thrashing" (a condition where the hard disk drive is constantly being
accessed, even in periods of little system activity).
<P>
The following error message may appear when system memory is finally
exhausted:
<P>
<PRE>   {DLL Initialization Failed}
   Initialization of the dynamic link library KERNEL32.DLL failed. The
   process is terminating abnormally. [(NTSTATUS) 0xC0000142L]

</PRE>NOTE: The symptoms are not evident using the same application under Windows
NT version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When an application spawns a process repeatedly, a new thread instance will
be created for each process but the previous instances may not be cleaned
up. This results in a significant virtual memory loss each time the process
is spawned. Executing the following Win32 calls will result in the same
memory loss symptoms listed above.
<P>
<PRE>   CreateProcess(anyprocess,...,............, &amp;pi);
   CloseHandle(pi.hProcess);
   CloseHandle(pi.hThread);

</PRE>NOTE: If there is a WaitForInputIdle() call between CreateProcess() and
CloseHandle(),the problem does not occur.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WINSRV.DLL was modified to correct this behavior. Even when processes are
repeatedly created by an application, WINSRV.DLL ensures that the process
and thread handles are closed upon command.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5.
This problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
