The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To validate access to resources in a trusting domain, the trusting domain's
primary domain controller (PDC) establishes a secure channel with a domain
controller in the trusted domain. Pass-through authentication then occurs
over this secure channel. However, in WAN environments, the trusted
domain's domain controllers may be dispersed over a wide variety of fast
and slow links. If a fast link is unavailable at the time when the trusting
domain's PDC wants to establish a secure channel, the secure channel may be
established with a domain controller over a slow link. Even when the fast
link is reestablished, pass-through authentications may be sent over a slow
link to the trusted domain's domain controller.
<P>
You can use the NLTEST utility to break and re-initialize a secure channel.
NLTEST is a Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit utility that is used to get
information about an existing trust or to reset a trust's secure channel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The mechanism for establishing a secure channel is very similar to a normal
user logon process. That is, the trusting domain's PDC sends out logon
requests to all known domain controllers in the trusted domain. The
trusting PDC sets up a secure channel with the first trusted domain
controller that responds to this request.
<P>
Normally, this method is preferred because the first domain controller to
respond to a logon request is typically the controller that is located
across the fastest communication link. However, if that link is down or the
"fast" domain controller is unavailable, a domain controller over a slower
link may respond first, and all pass-through authentications will be made
over this slow link.
<P>
Currently, no mechanism in Windows NT Server checks for a suitably fast
connection. Also, in current versions of Windows NT Server, there is no way
to select a preferred trusted domain controller to handle the secure
channel.
<P>
However, there is a mechanism in place to track how long it takes to do an
authentication over the existing secure channel. If a pass-through
authentication takes more than 45 seconds, that fact is noted. If two such
authentications exceed that limit, a rediscovery process begins, the
current secure channel is broken, and the trusting domain's PDC once again
sends out logon requests to all known trusted domain controllers.
<P>
However, because this mechanism tracks only communications that take longer
than 45 seconds, users may see a 40-second delay every time they attempt to
use a resource without a secure-channel reset taking place.
<P>
NLTEST is a command-line utility that you can use to check on secure
channel status, as well as other information (such as when the secure
channel password was last changed) useful in a trusting environment. You
can also use NLTEST to restart the discovery process for a new trusted
domain controller. The syntax of NLTEST is:
<P>
<PRE>   NLTEST /sc_query:&lt;Account Domain&gt;

</PRE>Where &lt;Account Domain&gt; is the name of the trusted domain. This returns the
name of the trusted domain controller with which the trusting PDC has a
secure channel. If that domain controller is unacceptable, use the
following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   NLTEST /sc_reset:&lt;Account Domain&gt;

</PRE>You should run NLTEST on the trusting domain's PDC.
<P>
Along with running NLTEST manually, it is possible to write a small batch
process that periodically (perhaps using the Windows NT Server AT
Scheduler) runs the first query, compares the resulting controller's name
against a list of acceptable controllers, and then uses the reset command
if necessary. This does not guarantee that a "fast" domain controller will
be located, but it gives users the current fastest connection available.
