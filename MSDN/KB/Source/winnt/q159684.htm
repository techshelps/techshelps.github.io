<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article will explain general configuration and usage of dial up links
with Routing and Remote Access Service Update.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a Routing and Remote Access Service router connects to another
Routing and Remote Access router as a demand-dial router, both routers
will obtain an IP address for their local WAN interface from the distant
router. To establish this two-way address assignment, the interfaces need
to be configured correctly.
<P>
When adding a demand-dial interface, the username, configured from the
Interface Credentials screen, must match the name of the interface that
you will be dialing into and be a valid RAS user account on that system or
domain. If the username does not match the name of the interface, you will
connect as a client and not as demand-dial. To verify the type of
connection, click Active Ports and Connections in the tree view and look
in the type column in the list view on both routers. The type will be
client for normal PPP clients or demand-dial for Routing and Remote Access
Service routers. The router's connections must show up as demand-dial for
the routing protocols to run over the connection. The router being called
also needs the appropriate interface credentials. The calling router will
also try to validate the router being called. This mutual authentication
can be turned on or off from the Security tab for the demand dial
interface.
<P>
For example, you have a router in Portland and a router in Seattle. Both
sides want the ability to demand-dial the other location. You could make
one interface named PORT_SEATTLE on both routers. The username would also
be PORT_SEATTLE for both routers. The username could be PORT_SEATTLE of
the Portland Domain and PORT_SEATTLE of the Seattle Domain, or it could be
a valid dial-in account on the local routers. In other words, even though
the username is the same, it is not actually the exact same account.
