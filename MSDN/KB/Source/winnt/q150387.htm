The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Only five users can connect to the resources of a Windows NT Server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may be using the MSDN version of Windows NT Server, which is designed
for software developers who want to design and test software products that
operate on the BackOffice platform. By design, the MSDN version of Windows
NT Server allows only five simultaneous connections by an unlimited number
of users to any of the services provided by the Server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use one the following methods to determine whether your currently installed
version of Windows NT Server is the MSDN version:

<UL><LI>Check the label. MSDN has a different product identification. The
   compact disc envelope is labeled "BackOffice Test Platform" …

<LI>Read the licensing configuration, displayed during Setup. It includes
   the following notice:
<P>
<P><PRE>      This is a special version of Windows NT Server for the BackOffice
      Test Platform. This version supports up to 5 concurrent users for
      testing and development purposes.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The connection limits cannot be changed; if this limit does not meet
      your needs, you should consider purchasing the retail version of
      Windows NT Server with the appropriate number of client licenses.
</PRE><P>
</UL>Once Windows NT Server is running, you can use the following method to
determine if you are using the MSDN version:

<UL><LI>Double-click on the License icon in Control Panel. The following message
   appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Not available in MSDN Edition of BackOffice
</PRE><P>
</UL>The five-user limitation is explained in the following sections of the MSDN
License agreement:
<P>
<PRE>   2. GRANT OF LICENSE:
   (b)   Use-Server Software:
   You may use the Server Software for the sole purposes of designing,
   developing, and testing your software product(s) that are designed to
   operate in conjunction with Microsoft BackOffice. The server Software
   may not be used to support the designing, development and testing of
   software product(s) (e.g., as a repository for source code). The
   components of the Server Software may only be used on one and the same
   Server. A maximum of five (5) simultaneous connections by an unlimited
   number of users may be made to access and use the services provided by
   the Server.

</PRE>In other words, the software is provided so that customers can adequately
test their software on the BackOffice platform, but it is not to be used as
their development platform. They have to buy retail software to use
software as their development base for tools.
<P>
<PRE>   10. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS:

   No Production Use:  The SOFTWARE PRODUCT may only be used for
   development purposes as described in Section 1. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT may
   not be used in a production environment.

   (a) No Commercial Use:  You may not use the Server Software as part of
   or as the basis for a commercial public access data network that
   consists of two or more servers and that carries end-to-end electronic
   information traffic, such as messaging, data replication, fax, EDI, or
   telex, unless you obtain a separate commercial use license from
   Microsoft.
