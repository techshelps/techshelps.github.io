IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to configure your computer to use the Point-to-
Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) to connect and log on to your Windows NT
domain through a connection to your Internet service provider (ISP).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you establish a Dial-Up Networking (DUN) connection using PPTP, you
are required to provide a valid Windows NT user name and password.
However, when you provide this user name and password you are not
automatically logged on to the Windows NT domain. If you are not logged
on to the Windows NT domain, you may not have access to some network
resources. For example, you may be prompted to provide a user name and
password when you attempt to access a network resource. In addition, your
logon script is not processed when you establish the PPTP connection.
<P>
To log on to your Windows NT domain using PPTP, you must log on to the
domain after establishing the PPTP connection. To do so, use the
appropriate method:
<P>
NOTE: These procedures assume all of the following conditions exist:

<UL><LI>You have created a Dial-Up Networking phone book entry to connect
   to your ISP.

<LI>You have created a Dial-Up Networking phone book entry to connect
   to your PPTP server.

<LI>Your computer has a valid machine account on the Windows NT domain.
<P>
</UL>For additional information about configuring PPTP, see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
