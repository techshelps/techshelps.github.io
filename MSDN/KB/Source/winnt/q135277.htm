The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A Windows NT multi-homed computer registers with one of two Windows
Internet Naming Service (WINS) servers that are replicating with each
other. If you change the IP addresses of the Windows NT multi-homed
computer and register with another WINS server, the previous records on
the first WINS server are not updated. Therefore, the new registration
corresponds to the previous IP addresses.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
An active multi-homed unique replica does not replace an active multi-
homed replica in a WINS database if the owner's identifications are
different (the two records are owned by different WINS servers, neither
of them being the WINS server that pulled the replica).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not
already done so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.
<P>
To work around this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Create a static entry for the multi-homed computer in the first WINS
   server.

<P><LI>Enter the new IP addresses for the static entry.
<P>
   Inserting a static record is acceptable, because MigrateOn is set by
   default on a WINS server. If the node registers again with a new
   address, assuming the old static address has become obsolete, the new
   registration or its replicas will overwrite the old static entry.

<P><LI>Ensure that MigrateOn is set by selecting the WINS server Advanced
   Settings configuration.
<P>
</OL>After the records are replicated to the WINS servers, the previous
registration records, that are not used, are overwritten.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and
3.51. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Windows NT version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
