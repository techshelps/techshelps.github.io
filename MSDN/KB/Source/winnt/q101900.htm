<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server contains all the features of
Windows NT. It is, however, a superset of Windows NT. It has
additional enhanced features ideally suitable for a versatile network
server, as compared to Windows NT which can be used only as a
workgroup server.
<P>
The following features of Windows NT Advanced Server are not part of
Windows NT:

<UL><LI>Domain Control - Windows NT Advanced Server can be used as a Domain
   Controller which facilitates centralized network administration.
   Domain is a concept of logically grouping servers and workstations
   into one unit.

<LI>Trust Relationship - It can be used to set up trust relationship
   with other network domains to extend the network connectivity.

<LI>Advanced Fault Tolerance - It has advanced fault tolerance features
   which include disk mirroring, disk duplexing and disk striping with
   parity. This protects against data loses due to hard disk or
   computer failure.

<LI>Directory Replication - This feature of Windows NT AS allows export
   of files from a particular directory from the master server to
   multiple computers and update files automatically.

<LI>Central Location for User Profile - This facility provides the
   facility of storing multiple users operating environment called
   profiles at a central location so that these can be accessed from any
   workstation in the network.

<LI>Services for Macintosh - This enables Macintosh computers to
   connect to Windows NT Advanced Server as workstations and clients.

<LI>Extended RAS Support - Remote Access Services in the Advanced Server
   supports up to 64 ports, compared to 1 for Windows NT. This feature
   allows multiple remote workstations to connect to NT AS. It provides
   access to client-server applications and advanced security.
