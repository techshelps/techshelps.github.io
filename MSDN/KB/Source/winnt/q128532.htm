The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you promote different backup domain controllers (BDCs) to the role of
primary domain controller (PDC) several times, the File and Print Services
for NetWare (FPNW) server is not able to access the PDC and one or more of
the following symptoms occur:

<UL><LI>The following message appears in the system log:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Event ID #2625 - (EVENT_BINDLIB_PDC_SERVER_IS_DOWN)
      Description: The BINDERY library could not access the PDC for write.
</PRE>
<LI>JetAdmin and PConsole can set up a PServer but JetAdmin and PConsole do
   not successfully set a password. This leads to an invalid password
   response from the server.

<LI>When you attempt to manipulate PServers, the following error messages
   appear in Server Manager:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Invalid File Name
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - File Not Found
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
FPNW does not attempt to get the new PDC location. It fails the call and
postpones obtaining a new PDC location until the next call. Consequently,
the write handle on the PDC is lost.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, stop and restart FPNW service in Control Panel
Services.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
