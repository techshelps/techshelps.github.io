<UL><LI>Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are logged on to a Windows NT server running File and Print
Services for NetWare (FPNW) and you are also attached to a NetWare server
that is being controlled by Windows NT Directory Service Manager for
NetWare (DSMN), you receive an "access denied" error message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Passwords cannot be changed on NetWare servers whose account database is
being controlled by DSMN.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Login.exe has been modified to correct this problem. It now checks what
types of servers the client is attached to when it does a CHNGPASS against
an FPNW server and is attached to a NetWare server that is being controlled
by DSMN.
<P>
When it determines that the server is a NetWare server, Login.exe checks,
via a NCP:read property value, if the following are present:
<P>
<PRE>   NCP: Command = Read Property Value
   NCP: Object Type = 0x06BB
   NCP: Object Name = MS_WINNT
   NCP: Property Name = SYNCPDC

</PRE>Login.exe then determines that the NetWare server accounts database is
being controlled by DSMN and it does not need to change the password, as
the server running DSMN will take care of the password change.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Print Services for
NetWare version 3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT
3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
