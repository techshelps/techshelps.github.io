<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start your computer running Windows NT and using a SCSI hard disk,
an error message similar to the following appears in your system log (as
seen with Event Viewer):
<P>
<PRE>   Date: 11/2/95                    Event ID: 9
   Time: 10:02:04 AM                Source: aic78xx
   User: N/A                        Type: Error
   Computer: Machine1               Category: None

   Description:
   The device, \Device\ScsiPort0, did not respond within the timeout period

</PRE>These error messages often occur at boot time. You can identify when the
error message is issued by comparing the SCSI timeout event to when your
computer was restarted. Usually, one of the first few messages in the
system log is a message similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   The Event log service was started.

</PRE>If the SCSI timeout message occurred at boot time, the date and time of the
log service starting should be very close to the timeout message (within
seconds).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem is that the SCSI disk class driver (SCSIDISK.SYS) is looking
for SCSI drives that need special handling. SCSIDISK.SYS issues a SCSI Mode
Sense command. The timeout value on the I/O is set to zero, which means
that there is a chance the I/O may time out before the drive can complete
the operation. If the timeout occurs, an error message is logged.
<P>
Disk drives that are known to cause timeout messages include, but are not
limit to, the following:
<P>
<PRE>   TOSHIBA  MK538FB
   CONNER   CP3500
   OLIVETTI CP3500
   SyQuest  SQ5110
   SEAGATE  ST41601N
   SEAGATE  ST3655N
   SEAGATE  ST3390N
   SEAGATE  ST12550N
   FUJITSU  M2652S-512
   MAXTOR   MXT-540SL

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
For the drives in question, these timeout message are not serious if they
occur at system boot. However, if several of these messages appear in
the system log during normal system operation, they should be investigated.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We
are researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When examining the error message in the Event Log, the last four ULONG
values in the Data section represent the SCSI PathId, SCSI TargetId, SCSI
Lun, and a SCSIPORT ErrorCode. Normally, the PathId, TargetId, and Lun
would help identify a particular SCSI device. However, in this situation,
PathId, TargetId, and Lun are always zero, and the ErrorCode is always
00000007.
<P>
The Data at offset 0x28 would look similar to this:
<P>
<PRE>   0028: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
   0030: 00 00 00 00 07 00 00 00

</PRE>So if a system has a drive mentioned previously and the system logs an
error message, the error message will always indicate PathId, TargetId, and
Lun zero, regardless of the true settings of the SCSI device.
