<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Your data are being corrupted.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by a miscompare between a 32-bit value and a PTE's
page frame number, which on an Intel x86 is 20-bits. Every time Windows NT
flushes the entire translation buffer (TLB) it increments a 32-bit counter.
Every time Windows NT frees a set of system pages (for example, unmapping
an MDL) the current value of the counter is stored into the PTE's page
frame number field. When the PTE is reused, Windows NT compares the Page
Frame Number field to the current value in the counter, if they are equal,
then the TLB has not been flushed since this PTE was last used. If they are
unequal, then the PTE's virtual address can be reused without flushing it
out of the TLB.
<P>
The algorithium is designed to allow the counter to overflow which is why
there is a compare for equality rather than for greater than. However, once
the counter exceeds 20-bits (1,048,575), the compare always fails and TLB
flushes are not done when necessary. The fix is to make the 32-bit counter
also 20 bits.
<P>
The reason this is sporadic is the fact that system PTEs are reused in a
first in last out order. Hence when there are ample system address ranges
to map MDLs through, and the fact that various other operations cause TLB
flushes, means that by the time the PTEs get reused, a flush was already
done. A Pentium Pro processor is more likely to encounter the problem
because on a Pentium Pro, a context switch does not invalid the TLB as it
does on other x86 processors.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the fix mentioned below or wait for the next Service Pack.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem Windows NT version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
