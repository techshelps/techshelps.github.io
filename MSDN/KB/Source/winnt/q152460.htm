<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
SrvAny is a tool found in the Windows NT Resource Kit that is used for
running Windows NT applications as services. It may be necessary in some
instances to troubleshoot an application started using the SrvAny service,
and one of the best ways of doing this is by using Cmd.exe as the
application starts interactively from SrvAny. From the command prompt you
can then start the application in question, watch for errors, check
registry values relative to the service account, and perform other
troubleshooting steps. The following steps show how to set SrvAny to run an
interactive command prompt for such purposes.

<OL><P><LI>Install Srvany.exe as a service by using another tool in the Windows NT
</OL>Resource Kit, Instsrv.exe. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   INSTSRV SrvAny c:\reskit\srvany.exe

</PRE><P><LI>Click Control Panel and then Services. From the list of services that
</OL>appears, select SrvAny, then click the Startup button.
<P>
<PRE>   A. Configure the service for automatic or manual startup type,
      depending on whether your troubleshooting involves an application
      that is started automatically through SrvAny each time the system
      is restarted, or only occasionally.

   B. Select the System account as the service (or Log On As) account
      and enable the Allow Service To Interact With Desktop option. This is
      required for the command prompt to be interactive.

   C. Click the OK button. (It’s fine to leave the Control Panel, Services,
      applet running since it is used later in these instructions.)

</PRE><P><LI>If you require the regular use of the interactive command prompt, skip
   to step 4.
<P>
   A. Start (or switch to) the Control Panel, Services, applet.
<P>
   B. Select SrvAny from the list of services.
<P>
   C. Select the Startup Parameters text entry field.
<P>
   D. Enter the following text (modified to reflect your own Windows NT
<P><PRE>      path):
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      c:\\winnt\\system32\\cmd.exe /k
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Due to the way the startup parameters are parsed, the double
<PRE>         backslashes are required to be interpreted correctly as
         single backslashes.

   E. Click the Start button to start the service.

   F. Perform any necessary troubleshooting steps.

</PRE></OL>You do not need to continue with any of the following steps.

<OL><P><LI>For regular use of the interactive command prompt, first ensure that the
   SrvAny service is configured to start automatically by reviewing step 2
   above.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Having an interactive command prompt regularly established through
<PRE>      SrvAny as outlined in this article makes this command prompt
      available to all Windows NT users of the computer, and, since this
      command prompt is configured to run under the security context of the
      System account, all Windows NT users of the computer have System
      account access from this command prompt and any applications started
      from it.

   A. Start Registry Editor.

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious,
   system-wide  problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT
   to correct them.  Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems
   resulting from the use of  Registry Editor can be solved. Use this
   tool at your own risk.

   B. Select the following registry key from the window entitled
      "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE on Local Machine":

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SrvAny

      - With the above key selected, choose Add Key from the Edit menu.

      - Enter "Parameters" (without the quotes) for the key name.

      - Click the OK button to create this key.

   C. Select the Parameters key created in step 4B above.

      - Choose Add Value from the Edit menu.

      - Enter "Application" (without the quotes) for the value
        name and leave the data type at the default, REG_SZ.

      - Click the OK button to create this value.

      - In the String Editor window, enter the string value of
        "c:\winnt\system32\cmd.exe" (without the quotes), for example
        (your actual Windows NT path may vary).

      NOTE: In contrast with the format used for the startup parameters in
      the Control Panel, Services, applet, double backslashes are not
      required in the above string to be interpreted correctly by SrvAny.

      - Click the OK button to add this string to the Application value.

   D. Select the Parameters key created in step 4B above.

      - Choose Add Value from the Edit menu.

      - Enter "AppParameters" (without the quotes) for the value
        name and leave the data type at the default, REG_SZ.

      - Click the OK button to create this value.

      - In the String Editor window, enter the string value of
        "/k" (without the quotes).

      - Click the OK button to add this string to the AppParameters
        value.

</PRE><P><LI>Start or switch to the Control Panel, Services, applet.
<P>
   A. Select SrvAny from the list of services.
<P>
   B. Click the Start button to start the service.
<P>
   C. Perform any necessary troubleshooting steps.
<P>
</OL>From this point on, every time you restart Windows NT, the SrvAny service
starts an interactive command prompt.
<P>
