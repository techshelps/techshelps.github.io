<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Intel has developed a program called Rztest.exe, which tries to determine
whether your computer may be affected by the RZ1000 PCI IDE Controller
problem. In addition, for certain configurations, the program Rztest.exe
offers the option to fix the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There is a problem with PCI computers that use the RZ1000 PCI IDE
Controller. Baseboards that use this chip include Intel baseboards commonly
known as Premiere or Plato, as well as non-Intel baseboards.
<P>
This problem presents the potential for data corruption, which could
manifest itself as a misspelled word in a document, incorrect values or
account balances in accounting software, unexplained program failures when
program execution reaches a corrupted instruction in the executable code,
destruction of directory trees, or even corruption of an entire partition
or drive.
<P>
The only operating systems known to be affected by this problem are Windows
NT versions 3.1 and earlier, OS/2, Warp and LINUX.
<P>
Please see the notes provided by Intel at their website for additional
information on systems affected and correct use of the detection utility.
<P>
Updated drivers are also available from CMD Technology's bulletin board
system. The BBS number is(714) 454-1134.
<P>
For more information on Rztest.exe, contact Intel.
