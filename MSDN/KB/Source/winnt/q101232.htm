</UL><h3>When a Workstation Joins a Windows NT Domain</h3>
 
<P>
When a Windows NT workstation joins a domain, it appears in computer
browsers under the domain name it just joined and is able to use and
reference user accounts and global groups created in that domain. If
the domain trusts other domains, the user accounts and global groups
of those other trusted domains are also available for use on the
workstation. Domain and trusted domain user accounts may be used to
log on to the workstation or to allow remote connections to it,
referenced to grant permissions to use resources such as a shared
directory or printer, and referenced to grant user rights on the
workstation.
<P>
When a workstation joins a Windows NT domain, the following things
take place:

<OL><P><LI>The workstation shows up in computer browser lists as being within
   the domain, just as it does when it belongs to a workgroup.

<P><LI>The workstation can use accounts and global groups (but not local
   groups) from its domain and from any domain that its domain trusts.
   (User accounts may be logged on to or used to remotely connect to
   the workstation; user accounts and global groups may be granted
   permissions to resources such as files, directories, printers, and
   may also be granted user rights in the User Manager).

<P><LI>By default, the Domain Admins global group from the domain is added
   to the Administrators local group of the workstation, thus making
   the workstation remotely adminsterable by domain administrators.

<P><LI>By default, the Domain Users global group from the domain is added
   to the Users local group of the workstation, thus making it
   possible for any user in the domain to log on or connect to the
   workstation.
<P>
</OL>Items 3 and 4 are merely default settings. These global groups may be
removed from the respective local groups at any time by any
administrator.
<P>
<P><h3>Additional Notes on Joining Domains</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Workstations that are members of a domain may still have their own
   local user accounts and local groups and are still subject only to
   local security policies.

<LI>If a workstation doesn't belong to a domain, a local account must
   be maintained for every user that is to log on to or connect to the
   computer. By default, the Guest account is enabled, so that anybody
   can remotely connect to a Windows NT computer as a guest. They will
   only gain access to items which grant access permissions or user
   rights to the Guest account, the Guests local group, or to the
   Everyone "group". This is not the case with Windows NT Advanced
   Server, however. With Windows NT Advanced Server, the Guest account
   is disabled by default.
<P>
   NOTE: On a Windows NT Advanced Server machine, the Guest account is
   disabled by default.

<LI>By default, the domain administrator can remotely or locally
   administer the workstation.

<LI>By default, the users of the domain can log on to the computer
   locally or connect to it remotely. Of course, all security
   protections are still in effect, so logging on or connecting to a
   workstation doesn't compromise protected information.

<LI>To make a workstation appear in the computer browser list along
   with other resources, all that is necessary is to add the computer
   to the workgroup. Note that a domain may be used as a workgroup by
   any Windows NT or Windows for Workgroups computer without having
   any security implications whatsoever.

<LI>Computers that are members of a domain or that use a domain as a
   workgroup will all show up in the Server Manager main window. To
   distinguish between computers that are members of a domain, filter
   the main window using the Show Domain Members Only option from the
   View menu. Also, workstations in the main window that appear
   grayed-out are members of the domain which are currently not turned
   on or are not running the Server service. Normal workstations in
   the main window are currently on and running the Server service,
   but may not be members of the domain. A computer account must be
   created in the Server Manager using the Computer Add to Domain
   command in order for a workstation to be added to the domain. It is
   possible for a domain administrator to perform this step during
   setup of the workstation.
<P>
   Note: Server Manager is available only with the Windows NT Advanced
   Server and the Windows NT Resource Kit.
<P>
</UL><h3>Background on Windows NT Domains</h3>
 
<P>
Each workstation has its own user account and security database.
Information such as the list of accounts, passwords, and group
memberships are stored in this database as well as account, user
rights, and audit policies. The main advantage of Windows NT Advanced
Server domains is that they allow a set of computers to share the same
user account and security information. For the Windows NT Advanced
Server computers in a domain, the entire user account and security
database is shared. So, accounts, global groups, and local groups are
all shared by all Windows NT Advanced Servers in a domain. In
addition, the account policies, user rights, audit policies, and trust
relationships are all shared by all the servers. Windows NT
workstations can access and use user accounts and global groups
defined on the Windows NT Advanced Server domain that it is a member
of or domains that its domain trusts. However, all local groups and
security policies are controlled solely on the workstation and are not
inherited from the domain.
