The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The NetWare redirector component (Nwrdr.sys) of Client Services for NetWare
(CSNW) and Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) may send additional
GetNearestServer Service Advertising Protocol (SAP) requests even after
receiving a response to its first request.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
NWRDR was originally designed to send a minimum of four SAP requests even
if it received a response to one of the previous requests.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next
Windows NT 4.0 service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   01/05/98  06:07p               152,720 Nwrdr.sys (Intel)
   01/05/98  06:04p               277,552 Nwrdr.sys (Alpha)

</PRE>After the fix has been applied, there is a new registry parameter that will
set the minimum number of SAP responses Windows NT must receive. This
should be set to the number of servers that will be responding or set to
four, whichever is less.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help
topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before
you edit it.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NwRdr\Parameters
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Edit menu, click Add Value.

<P><LI>Enter the following value:
<P>
<PRE>      Value:   MinimumSapResponses
      Type:    REG_DWORD
      Data:    1 to 4 (default is 4)

</PRE><P><LI>Exit Registry Editor.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This change to the Windows NT registry requires the computer to be
restarted to take effect.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
