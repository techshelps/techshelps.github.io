The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0

<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are troubleshooting Windows NT or applications that are running
in Windows NT, you may need to verify that a print share or installed
printer has been completely deleted. The following information shows the
default locations in the registry database for references to installed
printers or print shares in Windows NT versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51 and 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is rarely necessary to remove a printer by altering the registry. In
most cases, you can remove a printer in Print Manager or the Printer folder
using the Remove or Delete Printer option. This immediately removes the
printer, but internally the spooler marks the printer for deletion and does
not actually delete the printer until the next time that the Spooler
Service starts. Therefore, you should stop and restart the Spooler Service
before attempting to recreate a printer, or before attempting to remove a
printer port that a recently-deleted printer was using. Also, you should
close Print Manager or the Printers folder before restarting the Spooler.
<P>
In summary, if you use the Print Manager or Printers folder to remove a
printer or printer port, then close Print Manager or the Printers folder,
stop and restart the Spooler Service. If you reopen Print Manager or the
Printers folder, and the printer or port is still present, then you should
consider removing the printer or port by altering the registry.
<P>
NOTE: ALL references must be deleted to ensure complete removal of the
print share or installed printer. You must also either Stop and Start the
Spooler Service or shutdown and restart Windows NT for these changes to
take effect.
<P>
<P><h3>Modifying the Registry</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serous problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
NOTE: Registry keys in the following procedure may appear on two or more
lines, but are actually one path; they have been wrapped for readability.

<OL><P><LI>Run Registry Editor (regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Go to the appropriate registry location mentioned below for your version
   of Windows NT.

<P><LI>Delete the registry information for printer(s) and/or server(s) you want
   to remove.
<P>
   NOTE: It is recommended that you first save each registry key before
   deleting it.
<P>
</OL>The following registry paths apply to Intel-based (x86) computers. If you
are running an Alpha-, MIPS-, or PPC-based computer, substitute the x86
portion of the entries below with the correct processor type (Alpha_AXP,
R4000, or PowerPC). Text enclosed in angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) refers to machine-
specific or printer names. "\\&lt;Server Name&gt;\Printer" refers to the
universal naming convention (UNC) path to the specific print share.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT 4.0</h3>
