The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you log on to a Windows NT Server from a client workstation, and the
Windows NT server carries out a login script as defined in the Login Script
Name field in the User Environment Profile dialog box, the following
error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   "Bad Command or Filename"


</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The user is being validated by the Windows NT Server and the problem is not
in the script. The script may not even be running. The error message is
generated when the workstation tries to locate and run the script.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Changing the Advanced User Rights setting for "Bypass Traverse Checking" in
User Manager on the Windows NT Server domain controller can result in this
error message.
<P>
By default, the group Everyone has this user right. This can be changed
to limit this right to particular users or groups.
<P>
<P><h3>Bypass Traverse Checking</h3>
 
<P>
With Bypass Traverse Checking, the user can traverse a directory
tree even if the user has no other rights to access that directory.
Bypass Traverse Checking denies access to users in POSIX applications.
<P>
Bypass Traverse Checking allows users to access Windows NT Server shares
without having to have explicit rights to the directory structure above
that share, which is located on the Windows NT Server. Once the group
Everyone is removed from this right, users not only have to have
permissions to a share in order to access that share(and possibly NTFS
permissions related to that share), but they also have to have been granted
NTFS permissions to the rest of the Windows NT Server's directory structure
(which does not mean that the entire directory tree needs to be shared).
<P>
Bypass Traverse Checking allows Windows NT to skip the checking of
permissions higher up in the directory structure for a user and apply only
the permissions granted by the share and the NTFS permissions for the
directory (or directories) shared.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Re-add the group Everyone to the Advanced User Right of Bypass Traverse
Checking. A second option is to re-add the Administrator's groups and
Domain Users or individual user accounts.
<P>
