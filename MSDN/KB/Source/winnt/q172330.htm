<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Distributed File System (DFS) services on a computer running
Windows NT 4.0 and you create volumes (leafs) pointing to other shares on
the server, [and in User Manager you assign a home directory path to a DFS
volume (leaf)] you will be able to log on to the computer and the home
directory connection will be made. However, when you try to connect to the
DFS Root again, the following error message will be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   "The credentials supplied conflict with an existing set of
   credentials."

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you view the sessions for this server in Server Manager you will
notice that an administrative connection has been made to the DFS Root,
however, the connection to the volume (leaf) will be displayed as having
user credentials. During the logon process the system creates a session to
the DFS Root so the system can read the attached volumes (leafs.) That
session is created under the administrative credentials so all future
connections will conflict because the user credential is being supplied.
Because the system created the original session, stopping the
administrative session will not work because the system requires this
session for the home directory.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Currently, the only way to resolve this situation is to use standard
Server Message Block (SMB) shares and not use DFS for the home
directories.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
