<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.50, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A Windows NT Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) server may sporadically
lose its ability to resolve NetBIOS names by means of WINS. This problem
may also manifest itself as domain synchronization, browsing, or
connectivity problems.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur when a WINS server is configured to point to itself
as the primary WINS server and the secondary WINS server is left blank.
IPCONFIG /all may show the secondary WINS server to be its own IP address
but no primary WINS server is listed. When this condition occurs, all WINS
name resolution for this server is lost. This can effect browsing, domain
synchronization and connectivity. However, clients pointing to this machine
as a WINS server are unaffected. This condition may happen occasionally or
not at all.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
On each WINS server, double-click the Network icon in Control Panel, and
select TCP/IP Protocol, then Configure. Set the addresses of the primary
and secondary WINS servers to be the same as the IP address of the computer
itself (this will be listed above as "IP Address"). Having WINS servers
pointing to other WINS servers as primary or secondary is discouraged.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5,
3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
