The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You have a number of clients that are using TCP/IP to connect to a
multihomed server that has no IP addresses on the same subnet as the client
and the clients are always connecting to the same address on the server,
even though the paths to more than one of the addresses are equal.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the client’s NetBT layer attempts to resolve the NetBIOS name to an IP
address, it queries the WINS server for the address of a multihomed server
and receives a list of addresses that are always in the same order. NetBT
then takes that list and sorts it, putting addresses on the same subnet (if
any) at the top, followed by addresses in the same network class, and then
any remaining addresses. It then starts at the top of this list and pings
the first address to make sure it is valid. If it does not get a reply, it
will go on to the next address; if it does get a reply, it will use the
first address.
<P>
The problem is that, within these three categories, the order of addresses
is left unchanged from the list provided by the WINS server. This means
that, as long as the first address in the list is online, it will be the
one that is always used by every client, which does not provide for load
balancing.

   TITLE     : WinNT 4.0 SP2 Multi-Homed Computer Connection Enhancement

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next
Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   03/18/98  11:34a               120,176 Netbt.sys (Intel)
   03/18/98  11:36a               220,304 Netbt.sys (Alpha)

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
