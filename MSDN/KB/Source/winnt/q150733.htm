The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft File &amp; Print Services for NetWare version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Services for Netware version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
NetWare clients running login scripts that contain IF MEMBER_OF statements
do not work properly when run from File and Print Services for NetWare
(FPNW) servers participating in a master domain model.  The IF MEMBER_OF
statements are always false, as if the user did not belong to any of the
groups being tested.
<P>
CAUSE
 
<P>
FPNW uses pass-through authentication for verifying user accounts only.
Group accounts are only verified locally and therefore must be in the
local bindery of the FPNW server.
<P>
Adding the user to a group account which exists locally does not work
around the problem because the user accounts belong to the master domain,
not the resource domain.  Therefore, there is no user-to-group
relationship in the local bindery of the FPNW server in the resource
domain.
<P>
The problem is also true for member servers in a single domain.  Group
membership is not verified from the domain account database because the
user and the group accounts do not exist in the local bindery of the FPNW
server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following timestamp:
<PRE>   09/10/97  04:47p               244,128 fpnw.dll    (Intel)
   09/10/97  04:47p               222,656 fpnwsrv.sys (Intel)
   09/10/97  04:45p               438,544 fpnw.dll    (Alpha)
   09/10/97  04:44p               437,488 fpnwsrv.sys (Alpha)
   09/10/97  04:43p               265,676 login.exe   (Intel or Alpha)

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Print Services for
Netware version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Printer Services
for Netware version 3.51. We are researching this problem and will post
additional information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
