NWLink is an implementation of the IPX/SPX protocols popular in Novell
NetWare networks. An additional module, NWNBLink, provides support for
the Novell implementation of the NetBIOS protocol. This article is
divided into the following sections:

<UL><LI>NWNBLink Parameters (Microsoft Extensions to Novell NetBIOS)
<LI>NWNBLink Parameters (Novell NetBIOS or Microsoft Extensions)
<LI>IPX/SPX Parameters (Network Interface Cards/Token Ring)
<LI>IPX/SPX Parameters (Global)
<P>
</UL>CAUTION: Although you can modify all the parameters listed here in
Registry Editor, the default values should rarely need to be changed.
Any changes you make to these parameters can easily affect the
performance of NWLink.
<P>
Note: All parameters are listed in the following format:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;name&gt; : &lt;data type&gt; : &lt;default value&gt; (valid range, units)

</PRE>In Registry Editor, if no value is present, assume the default is
being used. If you cannot find the parameter, you need to manually add
it (choose Add Value from the Edit menu).
<P>
<P><h2>NWNBLink Parameters (Microsoft Extensions to Novell NetBIOS)</h2>
 
<P>
Registry path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
<PRE>               \NWNBLink\Parameters

</PRE>The Microsoft Extensions to Novell NetBIOS are provided to enhance the
performance of the traditional Novell NetBIOS protocol. NWNBLink can
automatically detect whether or not it is talking to a Novell NetBIOS
implementation that does not understand these extensions; if it is
being misunderstood, NWNBLink falls back to the standard Novell
NetBIOS protocol currently in use in Novell networks. Significant
performance gains can be realized if the extensions are used (for
example, if the NetBIOS conversation occurs between two Windows NT
computers).
<P>
<P><h3>AckDelayTime : REG_DWORD : 250 (50-65535, milliseconds)</h3>
 
<P>
Determines the value of the delayed acknowledgment timer.
<P>
<P><h3>AckWindow : REG_DWORD : 2 (0-65535, frames)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the number of frames to receive before sending an
acknowledgment. AckWindow is used as a clocking mechanism on networks
in which the sender is networked on a fast LAN, but the receiver is
networked on the other side using a slower link. By automatically
forcing acknowledgments, the sender can keep sending frames
continually. If both the sender and receiver are located on a fast
link, you can set AckWindow to 0 to turn off sending an acknowledgment
to the sender. Alternatively, NWNBLink can be set to dynamically
determine whether to use the AckWindow parameter based on the setting
of AckWindowThreshold.
<P>
<P><h3>AckWindowThreshold : REG_DWORD : 500 (0-65535, milliseconds)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the threshold value for the round trip time that defines
when AckWindow is ignored. The round trip time is an estimate of how
long it takes for a frame to be sent and received from a workstation.
NWNBLink determines this estimate and uses it as a basis for
determining whether it is necessary to send automatic acknowledgments.
If AckWindowThreshold is set to 0,  NWNBLink relies on the AckWindow
entry.
<P>
<P><h3>EnablePiggyBackAck : REG_DWORD : 1 (0 - False or 1 - True)</h3>
 
<P>
Allows the receiver to piggyback acknowledgments. Piggybacking
acknowledgments can occur when the receiver has detected the end of a
NetBIOS message. When the sender and receiver are not participating in
two-way NetBIOS traffic, you should set EnablePiggyBackAck to false.
An example of one-way traffic is a stock update application, where a
server constantly sends NetBIOS messages to clients, but the client
does not need to respond.
<P>
If EnablePiggyBackAck is true but there is no back traffic, NWNBLink
will wait the number of milliseconds determined by AckDelayTime before
sending the acknowledgment, then it will turn off support for
piggybacking acknowledgments. If the workstation at some point starts
sending as well as receiving data, NWNBLink will turn support back on
for piggybacking acknowledgments.
<P>
<P><h3>Extensions : REG_DWORD : 1 (0 - false or 1 - true)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies whether to use NWNBLink extensions discussed in this
section.
<P>
<P><h3>RcvWindowMax : REG_DWORD : 4 (1-49152, frames)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the maximum number of frames the receiver can receive at one
time. The value specified by RcvWindowMax is sent to the sender during
session initialization to give the sender an upper bound on the number
of frames that can be sent at one time. (Related parameters:
AckDelayTime, AckWindow, AckWindowThreshold, EnablePiggyBackAck, and
RcvWindowMax.)
<P>
<P><h2>NWNBLink Parameters (Novell NetBIOS or Microsoft Extensions)</h2>
 
<P>
Registry path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
<PRE>               \NWNBLink\Parameters

</PRE>The following parameters can be used to configure Novell NetBIOS or
Microsoft extensions.
<P>
<P><h3>BroadcastTimeout : REG_DWORD : 1 (1-65535, half-seconds)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the time between sending find-name requests. This value is
not affected if Internet is set to 1. (Related parameter:
BroadcastCount.)
<P>
<P><h3>BroadcastCount : REG_DWORD : 3 (1-65535, times)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the number of times to send a broadcast. This value is not
affected if Internet is set to 1. (Related parameter:
BroadcastTimeout.)
<P>
<P><h3>ConnectionCount : REG_DWORD : 5 (1-65535, times)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the number of times to send a connection probe. A connection
probe is sent by the initiator of a session if a connection could not
be made to the remote computer. (Related parameter:
ConnectionTimeout.)
<P>
<P><h3>ConnectionTimeout : REG_DWORD : 2 (1-65535, half-seconds)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the time between sending connection probes when initiating a
session.
<P>
<P><h3>InitialRetransmissionTime : REG_DWORD : 500 (1-65535, milliseconds)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the initial value for the retransmission time. (Related
parameter: RetransmitMax.)
<P>
<P><h3>Internet : REG_DWORD : 1 (0 - False or 1 - True)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies whether to change the packet type from 0x04 to 0x14 (Novell
WAN broadcast).
<P>
<P><h3>KeepAliveCount : REG_DWORD : 8 (1-65535, times)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the number of times to send a session-alive frame before
timing out if there is no response. (Related parameter:
KeepAliveTimeout.)
<P>
<P><h3>KeepAliveTimeout : REG_DWORD : 60 (1-65535, half-seconds)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the time between sending session-alive frames. (Related
parameter: KeepAliveCount.)
<P>
<P><h3>RetransmitMax : REG_DWORD : 8 (1-65535, times)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the maximum number of times the sender should retransmit
before assuming that something is wrong with the link. (Related
parameter: InitialRetransmissionTime.)
<P>
<P><h2>IPX/SPX Parameters (Network Interface Cards)</h2>
 
<P>
Registry path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
<PRE>               \NWLink\NetConfig\Driver01

</PRE>These parameters are specific for each binding of NWLink to each
network adapter. Currently, only one card is supported.
<P>
<P><h3>AdapterName : REG_DWORD : &lt;Adapter name&gt;</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the name of the adapter NWLink will use. This parameter is
set when you choose a network adapter to bind NWLink using the Network
icon in Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h3>BindSap : REG_DWORD : 8137 (hex)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the Ethertype if the frame format is Ethernet II. The
Ethertype field is only relevant if Ethernet II frames are to be sent
or received. You can choose the frame type using the Network icon in
Control Panel. For more information, see the PktType parameter.
<P>
<P><h3>EnableFuncaddr : REG_DWORD : 1 (0 - False or 1 - True)</h3>
 
<P>
When true, this parameter specifies that the IPX functional address is
enabled if the adapter is a Token Ring card. If false, the IPX
functional address is not added. The IPX functional address is
C00000800000 (hex). Novell has been phasing out the use of this
address, but it is still used in some places. It is up to the
application to take advantage of the IPX functional address. In most
instances, the broadcast address (FFFFFFFFFFFF hex) is used.
<P>
<P><h3>MaxPktSize : REG_DWORD : 0 (0-65535)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the maximum frame size the network adapter should be allowed
to transmit. If this number is 0, NWLink will get this information
from the adapter driver. This parameter allows the administrator to
make the maximum transmit size smaller than the driver allows. A
scenario in which you might want to change this entry is in an
environment in which the network adapter on one side of a conversation
is on a link that has a larger frame size than the link on the other
side. For example, if the sending station is linked to a 16 MBPS Token
Ring and the receiving station is linked to an Ethernet network.
<P>
NetworkNumber : REG_MULTI_SZ : 0 (network number in hex)
 
<P>
Specifies the network number to be used for this adapter. If it is 0,
NWLink gets the network number from the network as it is running. This
parameter is set using the Network icon in Control Panel. IPX network
numbers are 4 bytes (8 hex characters) long. An example of an IPX
network number is AABBDDFF. You should not have to enter a specific
value because NWLink will determine it for you. Make sure to get the
network number for your IPX subnet from the network administrator if
you want to enter a specific number.
<P>
<P><h3>PktType : REG_DWORD : 1 (0-4)</h3>
 
<P>
NWLink supports Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI, and Arcnet topologies. The
PktType parameter specifies the packet form to use. The valid values
are:
<P>
<PRE>   0 (Ethernet II)
   1 (Ethernet 802.3)
   2 (802.2)
   3 (SNAP)
   4 (Arcnet)

</PRE>If your adapter is an Ethernet adapter, choose between 0 and 3. If the
adapter is Token Ring or FDDI, choose option 2 or 3. If you are using
an Arcnet adapter, choose option 4. If the adapter is a Token Ring or
FDDI adapter, values 0 and 1 will work the same as value 2. (Related
parameter: BindSap.)
<P>
<P><h3>RipAgeTime : REG_DWORD : 5 (1-65535, minutes)</h3>
 
<P>
IPX maintains a routing information protocol (RIP) cache in order to
locate machines on a remote network. The RipAgeTime entry informs IPX
how many minutes to wait before requesting a RIP update for an entry.
This timer is reset when a RIP announcement is received for an entry
that is in the RIP cache.
<P>
<P><h3>RipUsageTime : REG_DWORD : 15 (1-65535, minutes)</h3>
 
<P>
IPX maintains a RIP cache in order to locate machines on a remote
network. The RipUsageTime entry informs IPX how many minutes to wait
before an entry in the RIP cache will be deleted from the cache. This
timer is reset when a packet is sent to the remote machine.
<P>
<P><h3>SourceRouteBcast : REG_DWORD : 0 (0 or 1)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the source route to be used when transmitting a packet to
the broadcast MAC address (FFFFFFFFFFF hex). If this value is 0, the
packet is transmitted to the single-route broadcast (0xC2, 0x70). If
the value is 1, the packet is transmitted to the all-routes broadcast
(0x82, 0x70). (Related parameters: SourceRouteDef, SourceRouting, and
SourceRouteMCast.)
<P>
<P><h3>SourceRouteDef : REG_DWORD : 0 (0 or 1)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the source route to be used when transmitting a package to a
unique MAC address that is not in the source routing table. If the MAC
address is in the source routing table, the route in the table will be
used. If this value is 0, the packet is transmitted to the single-
route broadcast (0xC2, 0x70). If the value is 1, the packet is
transmitted to the all-routes broadcast (0x82, 0x70). (Related
parameters: SourceRouteBcast, SourceRouting, and SourceRouteMCast.)
<P>
<P><h3>SourceRouting : REG_DWORD : 0 (0 - False or 1 - True)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies whether to use source routing. This parameter is only used
if the adapter is Token Ring. If there are no source routing bridges
on the Token Ring, disable this entry to disable all of the source
routing logic. (Related parameters: SourceRouteBcast, SourceRouteDef,
and SourceRouteMCast.)
<P>
<P><h3>SourceRouteMcast : REG_DWORD : 0 (0 - False or 1 - True)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the source route to be used when transmitting a packet to a
multi-cast MAC address (C000xxxxxxxx). If false, the packet is
transmitted to the single-route broadcast (0xC2, 0x70). If true, the
packet is transmitted to the all-routes broadcast (0x82, 0x70).
(Related parameters: SourceRouteBcast, SourceRouteDef, and
SourceRouting.)
<P>
<P><h2>IPX/SPX Parameters (Global)</h2>
 
<P>
Registry path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
<PRE>               \NWLink\Parameters

</PRE>The following parameters are global for the entire NWLink transport.
<P>
<P><h3>ConnectionCount : REG_DWORD : 10 (1-65535, times)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the number of times the probe is sent when SPX is trying to
connect to a remote node. If no response is received after the probes
are sent, an error occurs. (Related parameter: ConnectionTimeout.)
<P>
<P><h3>ConnectionTimeout : REG_DWORD : 2 (1 to 65535, half-seconds)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the time between connection probes when SPX is trying to
connect to a remote node. (Related parameter: ConnectionCount.)
<P>
<P><h3>KeepAliveTimeout : REG_DWORD : 12 (1-65535, half-seconds)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the amount of time the local side should wait before sending
a probe to the remote side to verify that the SPX connection is still
alive. (Related parameter: KeepAliveCount.)
<P>
<P><h3>KeepAliveCount : REG_DWORD : 8 (1-65535, times)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies how many times to send a keep-alive probe before timing out
if there is no response. (Related parameter: KeepAliveTimeout.)
<P>
<P><h3>RipCount : REG_DWORD : 5 (1-65535, times)</h3>
 
<P>
When the RIP protocol layer is trying to find a route on the network,
this parameter specifies how many times to send a request before
giving up. (Related parameter: RipTimeout.)
<P>
<P><h3>RipTimeout : REG_DWORD : 1 (1-65535, half-seconds)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the timeout between RIP request packets being sent out when
the RIP protocol layer is trying to find a route on the network.
(Related parameter: RipCount.)
<P>
<P><h3>WindowSize : REG_DWORD : 4 (1-10, SPX packets)</h3>
 
<P>
Specifies the window to use in the SPX packets. SPX uses the
Allocation field of the SPX packet to tell the remote node how many
receives are available for receiving data. The WindowSize entry
specifies what value to put in the SPX Allocation field.
