<P><h3>System Requirements for Windows NT/Windows NT Advanced Server</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
What are the minimum hardware requirements to run Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
Windows NT has the following hardware requirements:

<UL><LI>An x86-based microprocessor (386/25 or higher) with 12 MB or more of RAM
   for this release, or an ARC-compatible RISC-based computer with 16 MB of
   RAM such as the MIPS R4000, MIPS R4400, or DEC Alpha.

<LI>A hard disk with approximately 75 MB of free disk space for Windows NT
   (92 MB on an ARC computer), 20 MB of which will be used for the virtual
   memory paging file.
<P>
</UL>Windows NT Advanced Server has the following hardware requirements:

<UL><LI>An x86-based microprocessor (386/33 or higher) with 16 MB or more of RAM
   for this release, or an ARC-compatible RISC-based computer with 16 MB of
   RAM such as the MIPS R4000, MIPS R4400, or DEC Alpha.

<LI>A hard disk with approximately 90 MB of free disk space for Windows NT
   (110 MB on an ARC computer), 20 MB of which will be used for the virtual
   memory paging file.
<P>
</UL><h3>Hardware Compatibility List (HWFEED.TXT)</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
How do I know if my hardware is supported and what do I have to do to get
it supported?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
Microsoft provides a list, 1193HW.TXT, of tested hardware that is known to
work with Windows NT. It has been posted on CompuServe in Library 1 of the
WINNT forum. For your convenience the hardware list is also available in
Word for Windows format, called 1193HW.DOC. The hardware listed in these
files have been tested on Windows NT and are fully supported.
<P>
Any absence from this list does not imply that the hardware will not work
with Windows NT, only that it is untested and not supported at this time.
<P>
The form, HWFEED.TXT, is provided as a means for you to request support for
your hardware. It is also in Library 1 of the WINNT forum. You can mail it
via CompuServe mail to the Internet address listed in the form. Information
from these surveys is compiled by the development team to help clarify
where support is needed most.
<P>
Also, since many drivers are being written by third party companies,
contact your vendor to indicate that you need a driver for their hardware
to run under Windows NT. This will help expedite the process external to
Microsoft as well.
<P>
<P><h3>Full Screen MS-DOS Support on RISC-based Computers</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
How do I get full screen MS-DOS support on my RISC-based computer?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
Full screen support will not be provided under Windows NT on RISC-based
computers.
<P>
<P><h3>Device Driver Requests</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Is there a driver available for my hardware yet?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
Microsoft posts all new, fixed and updated drivers in Library 2 of the
WINNT forum on CompuServe. Microsoft is making every attempt to keep this
library updated with drivers as they become available. If you have hardware
that is not currently supported, or does not have a driver posted in WINNT,
Library 2, please make a device driver request by filling out the
HWFEED.TXT form and mailing it to Microsoft at WINNTHW@MICROSOFT.COM
(INTERNET:WINNTHW@MICROSOFT.COM, if sending mail from CompuServe).
<P>
Please note: Because of current support demands, this is a one-way alias;
Microsoft will not respond directly to you to confirm that your request has
been received.
<P>
The hardware compatibility list, 1193HW.TXT, and HWFEED.TXT files can be
found in Library 1 of the WINNT forum on CompuServe.
<P>
<P><h3>DELL Computer Only Recognizes 16 MB of Memory</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Why doesn't Windows NT recognize any memory above 16MB on my Dell machine?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
Some DELL machines have a BIOS problem which prevents it from seeing
greater than 16MB of RAM under Windows NT. If your machine demonstrates
this problem, please contact Dell to obtain the latest BIOS upgrade
applicable to your particular Dell model.
<P>
<P><h3>Limits of Support for Removable Media</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
I see some removable media drives on the hardware compatibility list, but
I'm having some problems. What are the limits of support for removable
media?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
Under Windows NT, Bernoulli drives and removable SCSI drives support a
subset of the functionality that is provided for fixed media devices. Only
a single partition can be created on a removable drive. Also, while
removable FAT volumes can be freely exchanged, removable NTFS volumes
require that a system restart when you change the media. Microsoft is aware
of the problems currently surrounding removable media and is working to
improve the situation for future releases.
<P>
<P><h3>Sharing Communication Port Interrupts</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Can I share communication port interrupts?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
Windows NT supports two communication ports sharing the same interrupt on
non-MCA machines. However, only one port can be in use at a time. A
communication port will not be created if another type of device is using
the same interrupt.
<P>
<P><h3>DMA Speed on an Adaptec 154x SCSI Controller</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Can I set the DMA speed on an Adaptec 154x SCSI controller?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
Currently, the AHA154X.SYS driver has a hard-coded DMA transfer rate of 5.0
MB. Even if you change jumper settings, the driver still transfers data at
this rate.
<P>
<P><h3>AMI SCSI Controllers</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
What issues should I be aware of when installing Windows NT with an
American Megatrends SCSI controller?
<P>
Answer:

<UL><LI>Installation in the Adaptec emulation mode may be accomplished by
   setting the controller 32-Bit Driver Mode to Disabled.

<LI>Amercan Megatrends is developing new ROMs which will allow operation
   with the 32-Bit Driver Mode Enabled as a Bustek Family Controller.
   Contact them for availability.
<P>
</UL><h3>Adaptec 154x SCSI Controller BIOS Versions</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Are there any issues regarding Adaptec 154x SCSI controller BIOS versions?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
The 1988 version 3.08 Adaptec 154x BIOS has a problem with the
Scatter/Gather feature. This problem is detected by the Adaptec driver and
the feature is disabled. If you have this BIOS version a message is
displayed informing you that the Scatter/Gather feature has been disabled.
If you get this message, you can contact the Adaptec BBS (408-945-7727) and
get the most recent version, 3.20, of the BIOS at no cost.
<P>
BIOS versions after 3.08 do not have this problem.
<P>
The latest 154x BIOS also supports drives that are larger than 1 GB (even
under MS-DOS). Windows NT supports this option.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the Sony CDU-31a CD-ROM with Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
How do I install the Sony CDU-31A CD-ROM drivers for use with Windows NT?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
The Sony CDU-31A CD-ROM is not by default available for setup or for use
with Windows NT. However, there is a driver and setup information for this
CD-ROM on the Windows NT CD-ROM.
<P>
NOTE: Most Gateway 2000 computers that ship with the Sony CDU-31A CD- ROM
drive come with the Sony COR-334 host adapter. This host adapter is an OEM
version of the Sony CDB-334 and is identical to this card in all respects.
<P>
The factory defaults for the Sony COR-334 and CDB-334 are: I/O base port
address set to 340 hex, DMA channel set to none, and IRQ set to none. No
IRQ setting is necessary for the card to operate correctly under MS-DOS,
and therefore most COR- 334 and CDB-334 adapters are not configured for an
IRQ. However, Windows NT requires the use of an IRQ. Use the instructions
in the README.TXT file to configure the adapter for use with Windows NT.
The driver and installation instructions are located in the following
directory on the CD:
<P>
<PRE>   \drvlib\storage\sony_31a\x86 (or MIPS)

</PRE><h3>MediaVision ProAudio Spectrum (PAS16) Sound Card</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
How can I get my ProAudio Spectrum sound card to work under Windows NT?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
If a MediaVision sound card has a SCSI interface, the CD-ROM interface is
supported by the drivers provided with Windows NT. If the MediaVision sound
card contains a proprietary CD-ROM interface, then the CD-ROM interface is
not supported by the drivers currently available. The only PAS 16 board
that is currently supported by Windows NT is the 50-pin SCSI version. This
board uses the driver TSLCDR.SYS under MS-DOS.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Sound Blaster Pro With the Sound Blaster 1.x Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
What considerations should be made when using my Sound Blaster Pro with the
Sound Blaster 1.x driver?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
When using the Sound Blaster 1.x driver provided with Windows NT to run
with the Sound Blaster Pro, the DMA channel must be set to 1. Note: The
Sound Blaster 1.x driver only supports mono sound, not stereo. There are
updated drivers for the Sound Blaster Pro available on CompuServe in the
PACVEN forum.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the Sound Blaster CD-ROM Driver for Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
How do I install the driver for my Sound Blaster CD-ROM drive?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
The Windows NT CD includes a driver for the CD-ROM interface on the
Creative Labs Sound Blaster card. This driver is included only on the CD
(not on the floppy disks) and is located in the DRVLIB\STORAGE\MKECR5XX\X86
directory. This driver also supports the Panasonic CR-52x family of CD-ROM
drives and the Panasonic CR-56x family of CD-ROM drives. More information
on installation is contained in the README.TXT file included with the
driver.
<P>
NOTE: The Sound Blaster CD-ROM driver (MKECR5XX) that ships with Windows NT
is for accessing data, MIDI, and .WAV files only. It is not compatible with
either the Media Player (CD Audio option) or the CD Player utilities
provided with Windows NT and cannot play CD Audio files.
<P>
Neither the Sound Blaster Pro or the most prevalent CD-ROM drives that
accompany the sound card and its proprietary interface (Panasonic CR- 521
and the CR-561) support Multimedia (CD Audio) operation in Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h3>Adding a CD-ROM After Installing Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
What do I need to do to make Windows NT recognize my new CD-ROM?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
From the Services application in Control Panel, locate the Scsicdrm and
Cdaudio entries. Set the Startup value for Scsicdrm to System so the
service starts when the system boots. If your CD-ROM does not support SCSI-
2 CD Audio, set Cdaudio Startup to System. Note: Some SCSI-1 CD-ROMs
require the Cdaudio service as well.
<P>
To start these services without restarting Windows NT, highlight them one
at a time and press the Start button.
<P>
<P><h3>SCSI and ESDI Drives with More Than 1024 Cylinders</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Can I use SCSI drives and ESDI drives with more than 1024 cylinders?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
SCSI uses RBA (relative block address) addressing. Usually, you do not need
to worry about a 1024 cylinder limit with a SCSI drive until it becomes
very large (greater than 1 GB). Some SCSI cards have a jumper for greater
than 1 GB support. Check you SCSI documentation to see if your SCSI
controller has this feature.
<P>
ESDI uses CHS (cylinder, head, sector) addressing and has a 1024 cylinder
limitation. Some controller cards get around this by implementing a
translation scheme in the onboard controller BIOS. Windows NT (and other
protected mode operating systems) must duplicate the code found in these
BIOS chips in order to duplicate this behavior. Unfortunately, there are
many ways of performing this translation, making it necessary to
incorporate them all in the standard AT disk driver. Support for every ESDI
translation scheme was not included in Windows NT.
<P>
NOTE: Some ESDI controllers implement this translation in hardware, making
it totally transparent to the system and allowing the standard driver to
work without change. Check your controller documentation to see which type
of translation is provided by your hardware.
<P>
<P><h3>Archive Python Tape Drive - No drive detected</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Why do I get the following error message?
<P>
<PRE>   Archive Python: No drive has been detected.
   Make sure a drive is attached and power is on.

</PRE>Answer:
<P>
The Archive Python driver was not installed. From the Options menu of
Windows NT Setup choose Add/Remove Tape Devices to install the proper
driver.
<P>
<P><h3>NEC CD-ROM Slow Downs</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
When my NEC CD-ROM plays audio CDs Windows NT slows down dramatically. Why?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
It was recently discovered that NEC Intersect CD-ROM readers have switches
that enable disconnects during accesses to the reader. This switch is off
by default, disabling disconnects. Because of this, while your CD-ROM is
being read, no other devices on that SCSI bus can be accessed. Since reads
from a reader can take a significant amount of time, having this switch off
can noticeably degrade system performance. This slow-down may occur even if
you are not using the CD-ROM reader.
<P>
The switch is number 5 and should be set to ON. It can be found in a little
box labeled SW1.
<P>
<P><h3>ATI Driver Won't Display a Higher Resolution</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Why can't I make my Windows NT ATI drivers display higher resolutions?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
The ATI driver uses the monitor resolutions that the adapter has been
physically configured for on the card itself. This prevents the driver from
setting the monitor to a resolution it may not support. Use the ATI INSTALL
utility to configure the monitor settings for the desired resolutions.
Note: The driver will not display a resolution that the adapter does not
have enough memory for.
<P>
<P><h3>Trouble-Shooting ATI Problems</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
I loaded Windows NT ATI driver and it does not function correctly. How do I
track down the problem?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
If you have ROM BIOS shadowing enabled, disable it. Make sure you do not
have a conflict between the memory base address or I/O port address
assignment for the ATI card. Make sure you do not have any other peripheral
devices set to the same settings. Look out for conflicts between your ATI
card and a SCSI controller in the area of I/O port address assignment
particularly. Use the event logger to determine when a conflict has
occurred and what I/O addresses are in conflict.
<P>
<P><h3>Display 16 and 32 Bit Color Modes in ATI Adapters</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
I have an ATI card that I want to display 16 bit or 32 bit color. It does
not work. Is there something wrong with the driver?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
16-bit and 32-bit color modes are currently only available when the memory
aperture is enabled. Check to make sure that the memory aperture is
enabled. If you are using an ISA ATI card in an EISA PC (or any PC), be
advised that the aperture can only be enabled if you have 12 MB or less of
system memory. (This is an ISA addressing restriction.) To display 16-bit
or 32-bit color in an EISA PC, you need one of ATI's EISA card products.
The same applies to MicroChannel (MCA) PCs. Contact ATI for information on
how to obtain the correct card.
<P>
<P><h3>UART Support</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Does Windows NT support 16550 UART chips?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
Windows NT will work with a 16550 UART chip. FIFO support will be enabled
by default if detected on the machine. However, if you experience dropped
connections, or loss of characters during high transmission speed, we
recommend disabling the FIFO support.
<P>
<P><h3>System Hangs on Micronics Motherboard with Ultrastor U34F</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
How can I make Windows NT work on my system that has a Micronics 486 VESA
local bus motherboard with an Ultrastor U34F local bus controller?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
There are two ways to work around this problem. You can disable the
external cache on your motherboard. Or, you can return your motherboard to
Micronics for repair. Micronics is aware of this problem and has a fix
available. The reference number for the Micronics fix is VLBA03. Micronics
can be reached at (510) 651-2300.
<P>
This problem is caused by a timing conflict between Windows NT, the
Ultrastor controller, and the Micronics motherboard. Note: This problem
does not occur on Micronics MX30 motherboards or ISA bus controllers from
Ultrastor.
<P>
<P><h3>S3 Based Video Card and High Resolutions</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
I have an S3 based video card, when I try to use the high resolution
drivers included with Windows NT my screen turns an orange color and the
logon box is black, what's wrong?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
You have a device configured to address 02E8 (COM 4).
<P>
The S3 graphics controller chip uses the port address 46E8 for one of its
register sets. When only the first 10-bits of this 16-bit address are
decoded in any operation the address appears as hex port address 02E8,
which is a popular hex port address for a COM 4 serial port. This results
in an address conflict and can prevent COM 4 from functioning and also
strange colors or unpredictable behavior in Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h3>Intel SatisFAXion 400/i Modem</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
How do I get my Intel SatisFAXtion 400/i modem to work under Windows NT?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
The Intel SatisFAXtion 400/i is not currently supported under Windows NT.
Please contact Intel for information regarding the availability of a device
driver for this modem.
<P>
<P><h3>TIGA Drivers for Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Are there TIGA drivers for Windows NT?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
We do not have support for the TIGA cards at this time. Check GO MSL for
any new or updated drivers.
<P>
<P><h3>No Speaker Driver for Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
Question:
<P>
Will there be a speaker driver for Window NT?
<P>
Answer:
<P>
In the current release of Windows NT, there is no support for a PC speaker
driver. The very nature of this driver prohibits its use. A preemptive
multitasking operating system will not allow enough CPU cycles to generate
the sound. The sound is generated by pulse with modulation which requires
100% of CPU time while the sound is being played. Sound cards offload this
to their DAC chips.
