The information in this article applies to:

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows NT version 3.5, a file association created in File Manager will
fail if a directory in the path has spaces in its name.
<P>
For example: If WINWORD.EXE is located in D:\WIN32 APPS\WINWORD, choosing a
.DOC file in File Manager displays a Program Not Found dialog box with the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find WIN32.EXE.
   This file is needed to run files with the extension 'DOC.'

</PRE>To work around this problem, edit the command string:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu in File Manager choose Associate.

<P><LI>Select DOC for the extension

<P><LI>Choose Change Type.

<P><LI>Enclose the complete path in quotes in the Command field.

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You can also modify the command string in the following location in
the Registry:
<P>
<PRE>   \HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\&lt;extension&gt;\shell\open\command

</PRE></OL>where &lt;extension&gt; is the file type or extension you wish to modify. To work
around this problem, include the complete path to the executable file in
the command value.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Spaces have historically been interpreted as characters separating
arguments or commands from one another. Since Windows NT version 3.5 allows
files and directories to contain spaces in their names, many programs may
need to be modified to accommodate the new file and directory structure.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available. This problem was
corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
