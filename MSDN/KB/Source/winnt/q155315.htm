The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you remove access for the Everyone group from an NTFS boot partition
and click the Replace Permissions On Subdirectories check box so that it
is selected, you lose all access to the partition, even if you are
currently logged on as an administrator. You may also receive error
messages stating that your desktop is not accessible. In addition, no
other users can log on.
<P>
When the Everyone group does not have access to the partition, no user
has rights to make any change or log on to the system. If you attempt to
log on, Windows NT returns you to the logon screen.
<P>
If you reboot the computer, you may receive the following error messages
on a blue screen:
<P>
<PRE>   STOP: c000021A {Fatal System Error}

</PRE>and
<P>
<PRE>   Can't access this folder, the path is to long" error when logging on.

</PRE>NOTE: You do not receive any warning that removing the Everyone group
removes all users, including administrators, and you are not warned that
some system-wide functions may no longer work.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Removing the Everyone group and selecting the Replace Permissions On
Subdirectories check box removes all users, including administrators, and
prevents anyone from accessing the partition.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue and allow users to log on after this problem has
occurred, use either of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Set up Windows NT on another partition or hard disk in the computer,
   using the following steps:
<P>
   1. Set up Windows NT on the another partition or hard disk.
<P>
   2. Log on to the new installation of Windows NT as an administrator.
<P>
   3. Take ownership of the original partition.
<P>
   You should be able to gain access to the data files on the original
   partition.

<LI>Reformat the partition and reinstall Windows NT using the following
   steps:
<P>
   1. Reformat the hard disk partition on which Windows NT is installed.
<P>
   2. Reinstall Windows NT, and then restore any data files from a
<P><PRE>      backup.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent the Everyone group from having explicit rights to the
partition without preventing access by any user, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Grant the user who is currently logged on, or a group that contains
   the user currently logged on, proper access to the partition. For
   example, the Administrators group should be granted Full Control
   permissions.

<P><LI>Grant the System group Full Rights.

<P><LI>Remove the Everyone group.

<P><LI>Click the Replace Permissions On Subdirectories check box so that it
   is selected.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Granting the System and Owner groups full access to the partition
after removing the Everyone group does not allow the default user ID, or
administrator, permissions to log on and access files even though it is
considered an owner. To grant permissions to the Administrators group,
you must explicitly add the Administrators group.
<P>
The user attempting to log on must have sufficient permissions granted
before logging on. The minimum permissions necessary to log on (assuming
the System group has full control of the volume root and all system
directories and files) are:
<P>
<PRE>   %SystemRoot%:                               Everyone - READ

   %SystemRoot%\System32:                      Everyone - READ/EXECUTE

   %SystemRoot%\System32\Repl\Import\Scripts:  Everyone - READ/EXECUTE
   (if users have logon scripts)

</PRE></OL>Depending on your environment, additional permissions may be necessary.
