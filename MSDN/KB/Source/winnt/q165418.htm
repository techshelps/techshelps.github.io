<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the steps that should be performed before
installing a Windows NT Service Pack, maintenance required after
installing a Service Pack, and also discusses Service Pack 2 for Windows
NT 4.0 specifically.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Follow Before Installing the Service Pack:</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Read the Readme.txt file to read installation instructions and view the
   issues that are resolved by the Service Pack you are installing. Only
   install the Service Pack if you are experiencing a problem that the
   Service Pack addresses or you are instructed to do so by a Microsoft
   Support Engineer.

<P><LI>Run the Windows NT Rdisk.exe tool to update the Emergency Repair Disk
   (ERD). You can update your repair information even if there was no
   original ERD created. The information used to create an ERD is saved on
   the system's hard drive in the Repair folder. The Rdisk.exe tool will
   update the repair information on the hard drive and then recreate the
   ERD when you choose the Update option. You can run the Rdisk.exe tool
   from a Windows NT command prompt.
<P>
   NOTE: The ERD is intended to provide just enough recovery to restore a
   system to a bootable state and is not a replacement for regular
   backups.
<P>
   For more information about the ERD and the Rdisk.exe tool, please
   see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><P><LI>Before installing any Service Pack, you should make sure that you have
   a working backup of your system. The only supported method of restoring
   your Windows NT to a previous working installation is from a Windows NT
   backup.
<P>
   For more information about backing up Windows NT, query on
   "ntbackup.exe" in Windows NT Help.
<P>
</OL>4) If you are running any form of Remote Control Software
<PRE>   that controls the screen display, uninstall it.  Contact the Vendor
   of the software if you have any questions regarding the correct
   procedure to uninstall.

</PRE></OL>5) Disable ALL third Party services located in Control Panel
<PRE>   Services.  Setting to manual startup is not sufficient.
   Reboot the server before continuing the installation.
   Any service that accesses the file system is ESPECIALLY
   important.  This includes all virus scanners, quota managers,
   and scheduling programs.

</PRE>6) Set all Microsoft services, which can stress the system in your
<PRE>   environment, to manual.  Some good examples would be heavily used SQL
   Services, Exchange Services, and Spooler on dedicated print servers.

</PRE>7) Always get a clean reboot with NO errors before starting to install a
<PRE>   service pack.

</PRE><h3>Maintenance Required After Installing a Service Pack</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Installing/Reinstalling NT Services and Protocols
<P>
   If you need to install or reinstall any NT services or protocols after
   you have installed a Service Pack, you will need to reinstall the
   Service Pack before you reboot your computer. When you initiate the
   Service Pack reinstallation, you will again be prompted to create an
   uninstall folder. Choose yes to recreate the Uninstall folder each
   time you re-apply the service pack. The Uninstall folder is used to
   restore your system to a bootable configuration if the need ever
   arises.
<P>

<LI>Installing the Next Service Pack
<P>
   When installing the New Service Pack, you should choose to create the
   uninstall folder. This will update the uninstall folder with the
   new Service Pack files. If you ever have to uninstall the new Service
   Pack, your system will be restored to the previous Service Pack.
<P>
   Before you install the NEW Service Pack, you may want to save the
   current Service Pack's uninstall folder. This will enable you to
   still remove the old Service Pack if needed. For example, if you
   ever remove the new Service Pack, your system would be restored to the
   previous Service Pack. If you continued to experience problems and
   wanted to restore the system to a state before the original Service
   Pack, the backup of the older Service Pack's uninstall folder would
   allow you successfully remove that Service Pack.
<P>
   To make a backup of the current Service Pack uninstall information,
   copy the uninstall folder to another location on the hard drive. You
   should rename the folder by the version of the Service Pack for ease
   in identification.
<P>
</UL><h3>Windows NT 4.0-Specific Information</h3>
 
<P>
Before installing Service Pack 2 or later for Windows NT 4.0, we highly
recommend that you verify there is enough free hard disk space to create
the uninstall folder. The uninstall folder requires a minimum of 60
megabytes (MB) during the installation and will require half of that after
the Service Pack has been applied.
<P>
To enable the uninstall option, you must choose to create the uninstall
folder whenever you run the Update.exe file. The uninstall folder is used
to replace the Windows NT system files that were updated by the Service
Pack and restore the registry settings from the last working installation
(before you ran Update.exe).
<P>
NOTE: You should create the uninstall folder each time you reapply the
Service Pack. The Uninstall folder is used to restore your system to a
bootable configuration if the need ever arises.
<P>
We highly recommend that you leave the uninstall folder on your hard disk
even after the Service Pack has been installed and is verified to be
working properly. You may install programs, drivers, and so on, at a later
date that may not be compatible with the Service Pack driver, thereby
causing you to have to uninstall the Service Pack. The uninstall folder is
hidden by default and is located in the following folder:
<P>
<PRE>   %SystemRoot%\$NtServicePackUninstall$
