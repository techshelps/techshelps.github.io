The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
NOTE:  The Directories and Files specified by this article are no longer
Valid.  Refer to <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q134960.htm">Q134960</A></B> for information on how to install CSNW / GSNW via
Floppy if you have access to the necessary media.
<P>
Microsoft currently has client software available to allow Windows NT to
become a client on a Novell NetWare network. NetWare Compatible Client
(NCC) is currently available separately for Windows NT version 3.1 and is
included in Windows NT version 3.5. It is available for Intel-based, MIPS-
based, and ALPHA-based platforms.
<P>
NCC allows Microsoft Windows NT workstations to access files, directories,
and printers on Novell NetWare servers. In addition, when installed on
Windows NT Advanced Server, NCC installs a file and print services gateway
that allows Microsoft networking clients (computers running Windows NT,
Windows for Workgroups, or LAN Manager version 2.x) to access files on
NetWare servers without having NetWare client software loaded.
<P>
NCC requires the NetWare Link (NWLINK) transport be installed and uses
NWLINK to provide file and print services to NetWare servers. It also
requires Windows NT version 3.1 with U.S. Service Pack 1 or later
installed.
<P>
NCC can be customized to specify such features as the preferred server and
printing options through the CSNW (Client Services for NetWare) icon in
Control Panel. When installed on Windows NT Advanced Server, the icon shows
as GSNW (Gateway Services for NetWare) reflecting the additional
functionality of the file and print services gateway.
