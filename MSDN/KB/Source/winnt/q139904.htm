The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups versions 3.11, 3.11a,
   and 3.11b
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information is supplied to help explain what the Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is, how to configure the DHCP server
and enable a Windows NT as well as Windows for Workgroups DHCP client.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Implementing DHCP eliminates some of the configuration problems associated
with manually configuring TCP/IP. DHCP centralizes TCP/IP configurations
and manages the allocation of TCP/IP configuration information by
automatically assigning IP addresses to computers configured to use DHCP.
<P>
<P><h3>DHCP Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
The following requirements need to be met by the DHCP server:

<UL><LI>The DHCP server service is running on a Windows NT Server on at least
   one computer within the TCP/IP internetwork.
<P>
   NOTE: Your IP routers must support RFC 1542, otherwise you need a DHCP
   server or a DHCP Relay agent on each subnet.

<LI>A DHCP scope exists on the DHCP server.
<P>
   A DHCP scope consists of a pool of IP addresses the DHCP server can
   assign or lease to DHCP clients. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      xxx.107.3.51 through xxx.107.3.200
</PRE><P>
   where xxx is any valid number for the first octet of the IP address.
<P>
</UL>The following requirements need to be met by the DHCP client:

<UL><LI>The client computer has a DHCP supported operating system. The
   following operating systems are capable of being a DHCP client with
   DHCP enabled at the client:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Windows NT Server 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
    - Windows NT Workstation 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
    - Windows 95
    - Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows
      for Workgroups installed
    - MS Network Client 3.0 for MS-DOS with the real mode TCP/IP driver
      installed
    - LAN Manager 2.2c
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>Installing the DHCP Server Service</h3>
 
<P>
Prior to installing the DHCP service, you must log on as administrator
from the primary domain controller. To install the DHCP Server service,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run Control Panel and choose Network.

<P><LI>Choose Add Software.

<P><LI>In the Add Network Software dialog box, select TCP/IP Protocol And
   Related Components, and then choose Continue.
<P>
   The Windows NT TCP/IP Installation Options dialog box appears,
   displaying the TCP/IP components available to be installed.

<P><LI>Select DHCP Server Service, and then choose Continue.
<P>
   The Windows NT setup box appears, prompting you for the full path of
   the Windows NT distribution files.
<P>
   NOTE: You may be prompted with the following message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      At least one of your adapters has automatic DHCP configuration
      enabled. In order to correctly install the DHCP server, setup will
      disable automatic DHCP configuration. Are you sure you want to
      install the DHCP Server?
</PRE><P>
   Choose Continue.

<P><LI>Type the path to the location of Windows NT Server distribution files,
   and choose Continue.
<P>
   If you install from compact disc, the path is under the \I386
   directory.
<P>
   The TCP/IP configuration Box appears.

<P><LI>Enter the static IP address of the DHCP Server as well as the subnet
   mask and the default gateway. If you use Windows Internet Name Service
   (WINS), add the primary and secondary WINS addresses here.
<P>
   The appropriate files are copied to your server, and then the Network
   Settings dialog box appears.

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
   A Network Settings Change dialog box appears, indicating that the
   system must be restarted to initialize the new configuration.

<P><LI>Save any unsaved work in other windows and choose Restart Now to
   restart Windows NT Server.

<P><LI>Log on as Administrator.
<P>
</OL><h3>Configuring a DHCP Scope</h3>
 
<P>
Be sure to install and initialize the DHCP Server before completing the
next step.
<P>
To configure the DHCP scope, you must log on as administrator. Configuring
the DHCP scope supplies the DHCP client with the range of IP addresses from
which the server draws from and a subnet mask to be assigned to clients.
<P>
The DHCP Server provides:

<UL><LI>Default gateway address
<LI>Domain Name
<LI>Service server addresses
<LI>WINS server addresses
<LI>NETBIOS name resolution type.
<P>
</UL>For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q121005.htm">Q121005</A></B>
   TITLE     : DHCP Options Supported by Clients

</PRE><P><LI>From the Network Administration group, start DHCP Manager.
<P>
   The DHCP Manager window appears.

<P><LI>Under DHCP Servers, select *Local Machine*
<P>
   Local Machine indicates that you are configuring the local DHCP server,
   and not a remote DHCP server.

<P><LI>From the Scope menu, choose Create.
<P>
   The Create Scope dialog box appears.

<P><LI>Complete the scope configuration.
<P>
   The DHCP server cannot be a DHCP client. It must have a static IP
   address, subnet mask, and default gateway address. You also have the
   option of assigning an exclusion range or specific excluded addresses
   as well as lease duration and a name.

<P><LI>Choose OK when done.

<P><LI>Choose Yes to activate the scope.
<P>
   The DHCP Manager window appears with the new scope added. Notice the
   yellow light bulb next to the IP address. This indicates an active
   scope.

<P><LI>Close the DHCP Manager.
<P>
</OL><h3>Enabling DHCP at the Client</h3>
 
<P>
To enable the Windows NT DHCP client, you must log on as administrator at
the Windows NT client.
<P>
Normally, you enable DHCP as part of the installation procedure
for Microsoft TCP/IP, however, you can use this procedure if you have
manually configured TCP/IP:

<OL><P><LI>Run Control Panel and choose Network.
<P>
   The Network Settings dialog box appears.

<P><LI>Under Installed Network Software, select TCP/IP Protocol and then
   choose configure.
<P>
   The TCP/IP configuration dialog box appears.

<P><LI>Select Enable Automatic DHCP Configuration.
<P>
   A Microsoft (MS) TCP/IP message appears, indicating that the DHCP
   Protocol attempts to configure the server automatically during system
   initialization.

<P><LI>Choose Yes.
<P>
   A MS TCP/IP Configuration dialog box appears, displaying current TCP/IP
   configuration parameters. The IP Address and Subnet Mask boxes are not
   available (grayed out) and the manually configured values are no longer
   displayed.

<P><LI>Choose OK to return to the Network Settings dialog box.

<P><LI>Choose OK again.

<P><LI>Shut down and restart the computer.
<P>
</OL>To enable DHCP on a Windows for Workgroups client if TCP/IP is not
installed yet:

<OL><P><LI>Use Network Setup to install the MS TCP/IP-32 3.11 protocol.

<P><LI>In the MS TCP/IP Configuration dialog box, select the Enable Automatic
   DHCP Configuration check box, and choose Continue.

<P><LI>Restart the computer to initialize TCP/IP using DHCP.
<P>
</OL>To enable DHCP on a Windows for Workgroups client if TCP/IP is installed:

<OL><P><LI>To access the Network Drivers dialog box, run Network Setup.

<P><LI>Select Microsoft TCP/IP-32 3.11, and then choose Setup.

<P><LI>In the MS TCP/IP Configuration dialog box, select the Enable Automatic
   DHCP Configuration check box, and choose continue.
<P>
   A message box appears indicating that the configuration of DHCP
   overrides any values established locally.

<P><LI>Choose Yes.

<P><LI>To initialize TCP/IP using DHCP information, restart the computer.
