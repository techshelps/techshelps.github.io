<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT 4.0 System Policy Editor allows administrators to determine
what applications can be run on computers running Windows NT 4.0 by using
the "Run only allowed Windows applications" option.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The "Run only allowed Windows applications" entry under the System
Restrictions book of System Policy Editor can be assigned to specific
users and groups, or to default users.
<P>
Enabling this option limits what applications can be run on computers
running Windows NT 4.0, if the applications are called through the shell
name space.
<P>
When a user attempts to run an application not specified in System Policy
Editor, the following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Restrictions: This operation has been canceled due to restrictions in
   effect on this computer. Please contact your system administrator.

</PRE>Microsoft Office applications, including Office 95, include the utilities
Msinfo.exe and Msinfo32.exe. These applications bypass the shell name space
and, because of this, they are not monitored or restricted by the System
Policy. This allows users to run applications even if they are not listed
in the System Policy's "Allowed to run" list. Administrators may choose to
customize installations so these utilities are not installed.
<P>
Another consideration for System Policies is the use of reference accounts.
A reference account is a special user created specifically as the logon
account for the administrator who will be setting System Policies. Logging
on as an administrator named POLICY and setting policies under this account
will help prevent a situation in which even administrators cannot run
server tools. It is easy, by using the "Allowed to run" policy, to restrict
even the administrator account from running administration tools. Because
of this it is better not to manage System Policies while logged on as
Administrator.
