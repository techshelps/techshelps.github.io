<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you choose to manually add a network adapter either during setup
or after setup through Control Panel, Windows NT presents you with a
list of network adapter choices. The contents of the list depends on
which network adapters you have .INF files for in your SYSTEM32
subdirectory of Windows NT, as well as the bus type of your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
All network adapters that can be installed under Windows NT must have
an .INF file for them in the SYSTEM32 subdirectory of Windows NT.
These files are always of the following format
<P>
<PRE>   OEMNADxx.INF

</PRE>where "xx" is a two-letter abbreviation representing the network
adapter. Each .INF file contains a section with the following header:
<P>
<PRE>   [PlatformsSupported]

</PRE>This section can contain the following values:
<P>
<PRE>   ISA
   EISA
   MCA
   "Jazz-Internal Bus"

</PRE>Each value indicates a bus type that is supported by the network cards
described in the .INF file.
<P>
NOTE: "Jazz-Internal Bus" is the bus on Advanced RISC Computing (ARC)
computers such as the SGI MIPS and DEC Alpha.
<P>
When the network Setup program compiles the list of network adapters
that can be added to the computer, it parses these files and lists any
adapters whose .INF file contains the correct bus option for the
computer on which you are installing the network adapter. Note that
while network adapters that are ISA-only can be installed on EISA
computers and are therefore listed as an available option, the reverse
is not true.
<P>
The text strings that are added to the network adapter options list
are contained in each .INF file in the [OptionsTextENG] section.
<P>
<P>

following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
