The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Process and threads in Windows NT run at a variety of priorities. Higher
priority processes get more CPU time. The Windows NT server service
priority is tied to the priority of the active foreground process. When
tuning the performance of your system, it is important to understand the
relationship between the server service priority and the foreground process
priority.
<P>
By default, the server service priority is the same as the foreground
process priority. Changing the Tasking option in the System applet of the
Control Panel will affect the server service priority.
<P>
In addition, it is possible to change the relationship between the
foreground and server priority through a Registry parameter.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In order to change the priority of all server threads in relation to the
base priority of the foreground process, you can configure it through the
Windows NT Registry.
<P>
NOTE: Higher priority can give better server performance at the cost of
local responsiveness. Lower priority balances server needs with the needs
of other processes on the system.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
<PRE>   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

</PRE><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) and go to the following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
      \LanmanServer\Parameters
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Add Value.

<P><LI>Enter the following values:
<P>
<P><PRE>     Value Name: ThreadPriority
     Data Type:  REG_DWORD
<PRE></PRE>     Decimal:     &lt;value below&gt;

     Decimal Description
     -------------------
      0      Process running at background priority
      1      Server threads running at same priority as foreground
             (Default)
      2      Server threads running one priority higher than foreground
     15      Server threads running at real-time priority (Not Recommended)

   NOTE: A value of 15 should never be used in production. If the
   server becomes busy, other important system process could become
   resource starved.

</PRE><P><LI>Quit Registry Editor and restart Windows NT.
<P>
</OL>WARNING: With the default Server ThreadPriority set to 1, changing the
tasking option to "Foreground and Background Applications Equally
Responsive" sets the server service priority to the same level as the
foreground and background priorities. This could cause your server service
to degrade in performance because it must now share time equally with other
background processes.
