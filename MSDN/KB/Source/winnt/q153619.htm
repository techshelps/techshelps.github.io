The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you run Windows NT on a computer with two IDE adapters (for example,
Dual channel EIDE) and a PC-Card (PCMCIA) controller with a type III slot
(suitable for hard disks), you may encounter the following problem.
<P>
When you boot Windows NT with a PC-Card hard disk, your internal fixed disk
is no longer configured as drive C. This drive letter is assigned to the
PC-Card disk instead.
<P>
Because the drive letters of your internal hard disk have changed, most of
your applications will stop working.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When configuring the PC-Cards, Pcmcia.sys detects that there is an IDE hard
disk in the slot and tries to find an available IDE adapter configuration.
If the primary and secondary adapter are in use (for example, one disk and
one CD-ROM, each on its own bus) it will configure the PC-Card as a third
adapter on IO port 0x160.
<P>
Later during the startup process, when the ATDISK driver starts up it will
search for possible IO ports, it will find the interface of the PC-Card
first and configure the PC-Card hard disk as hard disk 0.
<P>
If there is no manual drive letter configuration in the registry, hard disk
0 will be configured as drive C and the drive letters of the other volumes
will be changed.
<P>
WORKAROUND
 
<P>
To regain your original drive letter assignment you need to create a manual
configuration for your drive letters as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Log in with an administrative account and, using Disk Administrator,
    configure your CD-ROM drive to a high drive letter such as Z.

<P><LI>Shut down Windows NT, turn off the computer and remove the PC-Card hard
    disk.

<P><LI>Turn on the computer, boot Windows NT and log on as an administrator.

<P><LI>Quit all applications and stop and disable unneeded services, for
    example server service, so you have maximum number of unlocked volumes.
    Volumes containing Windows NT and a page file cannot be unlocked.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: For more information on locked volumes, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A HREF="../SMS/Q136425.htm">Q136425</A></B>
   TITLE     : Err Msg: The Drive Cannot Be Locked for Exclusive Use

</PRE><P><LI>Start Disk Administrator and write down the current drive letter
    assignments.

<P><LI>Reassign all drive letters of your hard disk to some high drive letter
    starting with the high drive letters, for example, assign F to Y, E to
    X and so on.

<P><LI>If a drive is locked you have to restart to make the change effective.
    On restart you might get a message stating that you do not have a
    proper page file. You can ignore this until you are finished with the
    process.

<P><LI>Continue the change as described in step 6. You may have to repeat step
    4 after the restart to unlock volumes.

<P><LI>When all drive letters are changed and there is no drive C after
    restart, you can start to move the drive letters back to their original
    assignment. You may have to restart here too because of locked volumes.

<P><LI>When all drive letters are on their original place, shut down Windows
   NT, turn off the computer, and insert the PC-Card hard disk into the
   slot.

<P><LI>Turn on the computer again, start Windows NT and log on as an
    administrator.

<P><LI>The PC-Card hard disk should use the first available drive letter. At
    this point you can take care of your page file and enable the services
    you disabled in step 4.

<P><LI>Do not forget to save the current configuration to a floppy disk in
    Disk Administrator and to run RDISK. You can use this information to
    import drive letter assignments in other Windows NT installations on
    this computer, for example if you have to reinstall for some reason.
