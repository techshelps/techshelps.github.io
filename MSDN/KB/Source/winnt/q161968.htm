The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Copying files from one computer running Windows NT to a UNC path on a
second computer running Windows NT may fail if the Windows NT machine is
under heavy stress. This usually occurs when there are multiple,
concurrent, file transfers in progress. If the file transfers are
initiated by an application, the application initiating the file transfer
may log events with error 59 ("An unexpected network error occurred"). A
network sniff of the failure will show a TCP RESET segment being sent by
the computer running Windows NT that is doing the writing.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When under a heavy load, Windows NT may send multiple server message
blocks (SMBs) in the same network segment. Rdr.sys was incorrectly
assuming the response to the Session Setup &amp; X would be the only SMB in
the segment and was taking more data than it should.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next
Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows NT 4.0

   01/21/98  05:32p               264,144  Rdr.sys (Intel)
   01/21/98  05:29p               511,312  Rdr.sys (Alpha)


</PRE>NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to Windows NT 4.0 prior to applying
this fix.
<P>
<PRE>   Windows NT 3.51

   01/26/98  04:58p               260,384  Rdr.sys (Intel)
   01/26/98  04:55p               471,664  Rdr.sys (Alpha)

</PRE>NOTE: Service Pack 5 must be applied to Windows NT 3.51 prior to applying
this fix.
<P>
