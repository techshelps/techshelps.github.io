<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT supports the use of the Hewlett-Packard (HP) ScanJet IIc
color scanner if you use it with the DeskScan II software supplied by
Hewlett-Packard. In order to ensure that the scanner runs correctly under
Windows NT, you must carefully observe the following:
<P>
NOTE: Much of the information in this article also applies to the HP
ScanJet IIp scanner.

<UL><LI>The scanner must be connected and turned on before you start the
   computer.

<LI>The scanner must be unlocked.

<LI>The Microsoft-provided driver, HPSCAN16.SYS, must be loaded through a
   device= line in the CONFIG.NT file.

<LI>The HP-provided 25-pin terminator must be connected to the 25-pin
   Macintosh SCSI-out connection.

<LI>A supported SCSI Host Adapter must be used.

<LI>The cables must be SCSI I or SCSI II specification.

<LI>Install the most current version of DeskScan II software. (The latest
   version is available on the CompuServe HP Peripherals Forum or by
   calling HP at (800) 227-8164.)

<LI>The proprietary HP scanner interface card which ships with the scanner
   is not supported under Windows NT.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following operational notes discuss each of the essential elements
for correct operation of the HP ScanJet IIc. Troubleshooting tips and
hints for more effective operation of the HP ScanJet IIc with Windows
NT version 3.1 follow the operational notes.
<P>
Operational Notes:

<OL><P><LI>The scanner needs to be connected to the SCSI Host Adapter in the
   computer, turned on, and unlocked before you start the computer.
   Otherwise, the computer will not recognize the scanner. Unlike
   some versions of the Windows NT Beta, the scanner does not have to
   be installed, unlocked, and turned on when installing the released
   version of Windows NT.

<P><LI>Edit the CONFIG.NT file so that it contains a line which loads the
   HPSCAN16.SYS driver. Use a text editor, such as Notepad, to add
   the following line to the CONFIG.NT file:
<P>
<PRE>            DEVICE=%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\HPSCAN16.SYS

   The CONFIG.NT file can be found in the SYSTEM32 subdirectory.
   Setup copies the files HPSCAN16.SYS, HPSCAN32.DLL, and SCSISCAN.SYS
   to the hard disk when you install Windows NT.

</PRE><P><LI>The Hewlett-Packard provided in-line terminator must be connected
   to the 25-pin Macintosh SCSI-out port. The scanner may not be
   recognized by the system or the DeskScan II software may fail to
   work if the SCSI bus is incorrectly terminated. Usually, a SCSI
   bus is terminated at both ends, but not in the middle. Therefore,
   if the scanner is the last device on the bus, the end of the bus
   will be at the 25-pin Macintosh SCSI-out port. Do not place an
   in-line terminator at the 50-pin SCSI-in connection. The scanner may
   not work properly if the HP provided terminator is replaced with a
   terminated cable or other SCSI device connected to the 25-pin SCSI-
   out port.

<P><LI>Microsoft has tested all of the SCSI Host Adapters listed in the
   Windows NT version 3.1 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) with the
   HP ScanJet IIc. However, as stated in the HCL, not all of the SCSI
   Host Adapters listed will work correctly with the HP ScanJet IIc.
   The following SCSI Host Adapters on the HCL will not work correctly
   with the HP ScanJet IIc:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Maynard 16-bit SCSI Adapter  (ISA)
<PRE></PRE>      Data Technology Corp. 3292   (EISA Adapter)
      Olivetti ESC-1               (EISA Adapter)

   The Maynard 16-bit and DTC 3292 SCSI Adapters are appropriately
   footnoted in the HCL as not working with scanners, but the HCL
   documentation does not mention that the Olivetti ESC-1 adapter will
   not work with the HP ScanJet IIc.

</PRE><P><LI>The HP ScanJet IIc is very sensitive to incorrect cabling. In
   order for the scanner to work, the cables must be of high quality
   and meet the SCSI I or SCSI II specification where appropriate
   (SCSI II Host Adapters require SCSI II cabling). You must ensure
   that all connections are firm, with all connector pins in solid
   contact. Shorter cables have a greater chance of success than
   longer cables. Be certain that the cables are in very good
   condition.

<P><LI>Use the most current version of the HP DeskScan II software.
   Presently, the most current version is 1.62. Versions earlier than
   1.61 may not function properly under Windows NT.

<P><LI>Do not attempt to use the proprietary HP-provided scanner interface
   card with Windows NT. The supported SCSI Host Adapter takes the place
   of this card. However, HP has developed a driver that allows you to
   use the scanner with a SCSI adapter in the MS-DOS and Windows 3.0 or
   3.1 environments. The name of this driver is SJIIIx.SYS and it is
   available by calling HP or from the HP forum on CompuServe.
<P>
</OL>Troubleshooting Hints and Tips:
<P>
If the scanner does not function or you get error messages from the
DeskScan II software advising you that the scanner cannot be found,
then try the following steps:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-
wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct
them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>To check if Windows NT has recognized the scanner hardware, start
   the Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) and choose the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
   key. Select the following subkey
<P>
<P><PRE>      \HARDWARE\DEVICEMAP\Scsi\Scsi Port 0\Scsi Bus 0\Target Idx
      \logical Unit Id 0
</PRE><P>
   where x represents the SCSI ID number for the scanning device.
   Examine the entry at the SCSI ID number of the scanner. This
   entry should have a value of HP C1750 A.

<P><LI>In the Control Panel window, choose Devices to see if the 32-bit
   driver SCSISCAN.SYS was started. If it has not started, attempt to
   start it by choosing the Start button. Do not attempt to change the
   method by which it starts by using the Startup button. The default
   setting in the Startup dialog box is System. If you try to change this
   setting to Boot or some other setting, you may lock your Windows NT
   installation. If this happens, you will have to disconnect the
   scanner, start MS-DOS, and disable HPSCAN16.SYS in the CONFIG.NT
   before returning to Windows NT.

<P><LI>If HPSCAN16.SYS is loaded as a device driver in the CONFIG.NT file,
   but you do not have the HP ScanJet IIc connected to the SCSI Host
   Adapter, then your Windows NT will hang when started. The computer
   will need to be restarted. To recover, either turn the machine off
   and reconnect the scanner, or use the "dual boot" functionality of
   Windows NT by starting the MS-DOS environment and editing the
   CONFIG.NT to disable the HPSCAN16.SYS device line.

<P><LI>The DeskScan II software installation program will create a group
   called Scanner in the Program Manager. In this group, you will see an
   icon of a scanner with the icon title of DeskScan II. You may also see
   icons titled Scanner Test and SCSI Addresses, however, these two
   applications are not compatible with Windows NT. No resolution or
   workaround to this problem exists at this time.

<P><LI>Be sure that the SCSI ID number set for the scanner does not
   conflict with the SCSI ID number for any other device on the SCSI bus.
   SCSI addresses 0 through 7 are displayed on a small, circular SCSI
   address indicator located between the 50-pin SCSI-in and the 25-pin
   Macintosh SCSI-out ports at the back of the scanner. In the middle of
   the indicator dial is a small, narrow slot which can be turned with a
   tiny flat-bladed screwdriver. Once you change the SCSI ID to a
   non-conflicting SCSI address, the new SCSI ID will be recognized at
   system startup and will be written into the Windows NT Registry.

<P><LI>To determine whether the HP ScanJet is locked or unlocked, look for
   a rectangular opening at the back of the scanner just above the 50-pin
   SCSI port. If there is a half-height black plastic block in the
   opening, then the scanner is unlocked. To lock the scanner, you must
   press down firmly on the plastic block. When the block is in the
   depressed position, a black bar will appear in the rectangular
   opening. To unlock the scanner, push the horizontal black bar back up
   to the top of the rectangular opening.
