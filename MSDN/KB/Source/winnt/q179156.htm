The information in this article applies to:

</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the updated TCP/IP printing components that are
available in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3). There are two new
registry entries that allow line printer remote (LPR) to use any available
port higher than 1,023. With these entries, LPR is no longer restricted to
only using the 11 TCP Ports (721 through 731) and will not conflict with
reserved ports, even on very busy print servers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
TCP/IP printing (LPR) in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) and earlier
defaults to using TCP ports 512-1,023. In Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3,
LPR defaults to using TCP ports 721-731, as described in RFC 1179 (Windows
NT 3.51 Service Pack 4 and earlier versions). In addition, LPR in Service
Pack 3 is now configurable through two registry entries, that enable the
use of TCP ports 1,024 and greater.
<P>
For information on setting LPR printers to be RFC compliant, please
see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID:  <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q141708.htm">Q141708</A></B>
   TITLE     : Printing to LPD Printer Is Slow or Fails with Windows NT

</PRE><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
In Service Pack 3, a new registry entry is automatically generated when a
new LPR port is created. This setting is defined on a per printer port
basis and defaults to 0, which is RFC compliant. To enable individual IP
address ports to use TCP ports 1024 and higher, apply Service Pack 3 and
then use the following steps:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and go to the following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\LPDSVC\lpr
</PRE>
<P><LI>If the following value exists, double-click the entry. If the value does
   not already exist, click Add Value from the Edit menu and type the
   following information:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: &lt;IP address of LPR printer port&gt;
      Data Type : REG_DWORD
<PRE></PRE>      Value     : 0 or 1
                  0 = uses ports 721-731 (default)
                  1 = uses any port &gt;1024

</PRE><P><LI>Restart the Spooler service for the changes to take affect. Type the
   following command at an MS-DOS command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      net stop spooler
</PRE><P>
   To restart the Spooler service, type the following command at an MS-DOS
   command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      net start spooler
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
There is a fix available that will enable a new registry value,
UseNonRFCSourcePorts, to configure LPR printers to use TCP ports higher
than 1,024 with one registry entry that will incorporate a global change.
Use this fix on print servers that have a large number of LPR ports.
See the Resolution and Status sections below for more information about the
fix.
<P>
IMPORTANT NOTE: If all LPR ports were created prior to applying this
hotfix, an individual port entry will exist in the registry for all LPR
ports. These individual ports take precedence over the global entry,
UseNonRFCSourcePorts, so these individual ports must be deleted from the
registry before UseNonRFCSourcePorts will work for all LPR ports. The step-
by-step instructions below will go through removing these individual
entries and adding the new entry.
<P>
Obtain and apply the fix mentioned below and then use the following steps
to enable this new registry key:

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and go to the following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\LPDSVC\lpr
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Registry menu, click Save Key and type a filename.

<P><LI>Delete the 'lpr' key to remove all of the individual IP address entries.

<P><LI>Select the 'LPDSVC' key.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Add Key, and then type "lpr" for the Key Name.

<P><LI>Select the newly created 'lpr' key.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then type the following
   information:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: UseNonRFCSourcePorts
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
<PRE></PRE>      Value:      0 or 1
                  0 = uses ports 721-731 (default)
                  1 = uses any port &gt;1024

</PRE><P><LI>Restart the Spooler service for the changes to take affect. Type the
   following command at an MS-DOS command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      net stop spooler
</PRE><P>
   To restart the Spooler service, type the following command at an MS-DOS
   command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      net start spooler
</PRE><P>
</OL>In addition, you can use UseNonRFCSourcePorts in conjunction with the
individual port keys to specify an exception scenario where a specific LPR
port needs to be RFC compliant. After adding the UseNonRFCSourcePorts
entry, create an individual IP address port using Method 1, setting the
default for that port back to 0.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   08/08/97  07:50p                13,072 lprhelp.dll

</PRE></OL>NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to Windows NT 4.0 prior to applying
this fix.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
