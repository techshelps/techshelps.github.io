<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you print in color under Windows NT 4.0, the color quality of the
printed output may not have the same consistency as what is viewed on the
screen.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The use of a color management procedure is needed for colors to be kept
consistent across hardware. Currently, Windows NT 4.0 does not have support
for a color management technique known as image color matching (ICM).
<P>
To give the impression of continuous tone, Windows NT uses a process called
halftoning. The current version of Windows NT does not support halftoning
on 24-bit (or higher) devices.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The number of colors that a device can display ranges from almost none
(monochrome devices) to virtually limitless (24-bit devices). About midway
in this range is a class of output devices that can support full-color
resolution (or near full-color resolution) but can concurrently display
only a limited number of those colors.
<P>
Despite differences in imaging technologies and color capabilities between
devices, image color matching ensures that a color image will look the
same, or as close as possible to the same, when output to screen, paper,
film, and other media. Applications typically use image color matching to
let users create color images on the screen that can then be reproduced
exactly on a printer or on other screens.
<P>
For more information on image color matching, please see the following
documentation at these web locations:

</PRE>Halftoning is the process of grouping a number of adjacent pixel locations
together to form a cell. Within that cell, appropriate colors are placed
according to a defined algorithm, which the human eye integrates to produce
the desired color. This is also called dithering. For more information,
please see the following documentation at this web location:

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use a monolithic printer driver from the printer manufacturer if available.
A monolithic driver is a driver that does not use common routines that can
be called from another file. The routines in the driver are written
specifically for the device. These monolithic drivers optimally use the
printer by sometimes using proprietary techniques only understood by that
specific printer.
<P>
Contact the printer manufacturer for more information on whether a
monolithic driver is available for Windows NT and whether it will improve
the quality of the printed output.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
