<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A TCP/IP workstation can be configured to use only one default gateway,
which may present a challenge to users that are connected to a local
TCP/IP network through a network interface card (NIC) and to a remote
network using Windows NT Remote Access Services (RAS).
<P>
NOTE: A computer connected to more than one LAN segment in this way is
known as a multihomed system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If your are  running Windows NT and you computer is connected to both a
remote and local TCP/IP network and you attempt to access an IP address,
the destination host is located using the following process:

<OL><P><LI>If you have enabled the option to "Use default gateway on remote
   network" in the TCP/IP options of the RAS PhoneBook entry used to
   dial the remote network:
<P>
   a. If the destination IP address is on the same subnet as your
<P><PRE>      computer's NIC, the packets are sent via the NIC.
</PRE><P>
   b. If the destination IP address is not on the same subnet as your
<P><PRE>      computer's NIC, the packets are sent via your RAS connection to the
      default gateway assigned by the RAS server.
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you have not enabled the option to "Use default gateway on remote
   network" in the TCP/IP options of the RAS PhoneBook entry used to dial
   the remote network:
<P>
   a. If the destination IP address is on the same subnet as your
<P><PRE>      computer's assigned RAS IP address, the packets are sent via the RAS
      connection.
</PRE><P>
   b. If the destination IP address is not on the same subnet as your
<P><PRE>      computer's assigned RAS IP address, the packets are sent via your
      computer's NIC.
</PRE><P>
</OL>This may present a problem to some users. For example, if your LAN is
divided into two Class C subnets, 1.1.1.x and 1.1.2.x, and you configure
your computer on the 1.1.1.x subnet to use RAS with the "Use default
gateway on remote network" option enabled, all packets you send to the
1.1.2.x subnet will be sent via the RAS connection and not your computer's
NIC.
<P>
To workaround this problem, you can use the Windows NT ROUTE command to
add a static route to your TCP/IP route table that will instruct Windows
NT to send packets intended for the 1.1.2.x subnet to a router on the
1.1.1.x subnet. For more information on using the Windows NT ROUTE
command, refer to the Windows NT Command Reference section of the Windows
NT Help file (WINHLP32.EXE).
