<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
TCP\IP under Windows NT allows a computer to communicate over a network
with another computer by using either an IP address, a host name, or a
NetBIOS name. However, when one computer attempts to communicate with
another computer using one of these three naming conventions, that name
must ultimately be resolved to a hardware address. The following are the
steps used by TCP\IP to resolve a host name and a NetBIOS name to a
hardware address.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Host Name Resolution Using a Hosts File</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Computer A enters a command using the host name of Computer B.

<P><LI>The HOSTS file on Computer A (contained in the
   %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc directory ) is parsed. When the host
   name of Computer B is found, it is resolved to an IP address.

<P><LI>The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is then used to resolve the IP
   address of Computer B to its hardware address. If Computer B is on the
   local network, its hardware address will be obtained by using the ARP
   cache or by sending a local broadcast asking for a reply from Computer B
   with its hardware address. If Computer B is on a remote network, ARP
   will determine the hardware address of the default gateway for routing
   to Computer B.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Host name resolution using a Domain Name Server (DNS) is similar to
the steps outlined above. Instead of parsing the HOSTS file in Step 2, the
DNS looks up the host name of Computer B in its database and resolves it to
an IP address.
<P>
<P><h3>NetBIOS Name Resolution</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Computer A enters a Windows NT command using the NetBIOS name of
   Computer B.

<P><LI>The NetBIOS name cache on Computer A is checked for the IP address that
   corresponds to the NetBIOS name of Computer B.

<P><LI>If the IP address of Computer B is found in the NetBIOS name cache, ARP
   will resolve the IP address to Computer B’s hardware address (see Step 3
   of the Host Name Resolution Using A Hosts File section above). If,
   however, the NetBIOS name is not resolved from the NetBIOS name cache,
   Computer A broadcasts a name request with the NetBIOS address of
   Computer B.

<P><LI>If Computer B is on the local network, Computer A will receive a
   response to its name request broadcast containing the IP address of
   Computer B. ARP will then resolve Computer B’s IP address to its
   hardware address.

<P><LI>If Computer B is on a remote network, Computer A will not receive a
   reply to its name request broadcast. The LMHOSTS file on Computer A
   (contained in the %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc directory) is then
   parsed. If a mapping for the NetBIOS name of Computer B exists, it is
   resolved to its IP address. Since this is the IP address of a remote
   computer, ARP will determine the hardware address of the default gateway
   for routing to Computer B.
