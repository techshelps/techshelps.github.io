<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Print jobs from Macintosh clients may be printed incorrectly, often
producing multiple PostScript error pages. The problem seems to happen
only with complex print jobs that contain graphics.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when the AppleTalk protocol is not used to connect
to the printer. This is because there are two predominant binary
encoding schemes, "standard protocol" and "Tagged Binary Core Protocol"
(TBCP). PostScript originally supported several text encoding schemes,
plus "standard protocol" binary. Other languages originally supported
one or more text encoding schemes, plus TBCP. Standard protocol and TBCP
are mutually incompatible; neither is a subset nor an extension of the
other.
<P>
AppleTalk was designed to support PostScript printing, and although
AppleTalk's Printer Access Protocol (PAP) can transmit TBCP on the wire,
nearly every binary print job over PAP is PostScript using standard
protocol encoding. As a result, many print devices assume that all
binary data that arrives over AppleTalk is encoded with standard
protocol.
<P>
Similarly, PC-based network printing protocols, such as DLC and LPR,
were designed to support PC clients. When those clients send PostScript
jobs, data is almost always encoded as text; when those clients send
non- PostScript jobs, binary data is almost always encoded as TBCP. As a
result, many print devices assume that all binary data over non-
AppleTalk protocols is TBCP-encoded, even though the network protocols
can correctly transmit standard-protocol-encoded data.
<P>
The Windows NT printing architecture lets you receive a print job, in
any language, from any client, with any encoding scheme, and send that
job over any available protocol to any network-attached print device.
This flexibility lets Windows NT deliver Macintosh print jobs over an
LPT port connection (both DLC and LPR). It also lets Windows NT deliver
PC print jobs over AppleTalk. If this violates the print device's binary
encoding assumptions, you receive incorrect output.
<P>
A Windows NT print server can receive PostScript jobs from Macintosh
clients with binary data encoded in the standard protocol scheme. It can
send those jobs over an LPT port connection (either DLC or LPR) to a
network or locally attached print device that assumes all DLC, LPT port,
or LPR jobs use TBCP encoding. In this case, jobs will be printed
incorrectly.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Use AppleTalk to connect to the printer.

<P><LI>When you create PostScript print jobs (on any platform) that might
   be printed over a network, use "ASCII" or "text" encoding rather
   than binary encoding. This is an option in the PostScript driver made
   by Adobe Corporation for 16-bit Windows and Macintosh clients. The
   Windows NT PostScript driver always uses text encoding. Desktop
   publishing programs (on any platform) often generate their own
   PostScript code, completely independent of the operating system's
   driver. According to the Adobe Serial and Parallel Communications
   Protocols Specification, programs capable of both binary and text
   encoding should provide a user interface to select either scheme.
   The ability to switch modes can usually be found in the Printer
   Driver dialog box.
