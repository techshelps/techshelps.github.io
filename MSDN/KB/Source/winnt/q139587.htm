The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you run Microsoft Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) or Gateway Services
for NetWare (GSNW) on a Windows NT Server, version 3.5 or 3.51, and you run
the Novell "Setpass" command, the following error message can appear:
<P>
<PRE>   You are not connected to &lt;servername&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;servername&gt; represents the name of the server on which you are
trying to set the password. Or, if the Setpass command is successful the
following message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The password for &lt;servername&gt; has been changed
   &lt;ServerList&gt;

   Synchronize passwords on these file servers with
   &lt;servername&gt;/&lt;username&gt;? &lt;Y/N&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;ServerList&gt; represents the list of Novell servers to which you are
attached, and &lt;username&gt; is your logged on account name. But in this case
one or more of the attached Novell servers are missing from the list.
<P>
Similarly, if you run the Novell Whoami command, one or more of the
connected Novell servers will be missing from the list. At the same time
you can change to the connected drive letter of the "missing" server and
view the directory listing using the Dir command.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems are caused by having identical letter sequences in two or
more of the server names, and by having connected to these servers in
descending order of name length.  For example, the following server names
and drive letters assigned in the order will produce the problem:
<P>
<PRE>   Assigned Drive Letter         Server Name

      H:                           DPOPS2
      I:                           DPOPS
      J:                           DP

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Workstation and Server
version 4.0.
<P>
To work around this problem for Windows NT 3.51, ensure that all Novell
servers connected to your computer have names that are spelled with unique
letter sequences so that no beginning sequence of letters compares the same
between any two of the names.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and
3.51.  A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information on the
availability of this fix. This problem was corrected in Windows NT
Workstation or Server version 4.0.
