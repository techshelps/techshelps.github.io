The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you upgrade to Windows NT 4.0 from an earlier version of Windows NT,
all nonessential services and devices should be disabled before beginning
the upgrade.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In order to ensure a clean, stable upgrade from Windows NT 3.x, you must
disable or remove third-party services and devices. If you do not, these
devices or services may try to start during the reboot between the
character-based and GUI-based portions of Setup. This situation may cause
the computer to display a debug screen (for example, "STOP 0x00000050" or
"STOP 0x0000001E") and halt, or to become so unstable that Setup cannot
finish.
<P>
If a driver or service is not required for system operation, it should be
disabled before upgrading to Windows NT4.0.
<P>
If a driver or service is required for system operation (such as a SCSI
controller or network card), you should obtain a driver for Windows NT 4.0
from the third-party provider and have the driver available on a floppy
disk for use during the upgrade process.
<P>
To disable a driver, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Devices.

<P><LI>Click the third-party driver you want to disable, and then click
   Startup.

<P><LI>In the Device dialog box, click Disabled, and then restart the
   computer.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Devices, and verify that the device
   did not start.
<P>
</OL>To disable a service, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Services.

<P><LI>Click the third-party service you want to disable, and then click
   Startup.

<P><LI>In the Service dialog box, click Disabled, and then restart the
   computer.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Services, and then verify that the
   service did not start.
<P></OL>
