The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>  - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform Windows NT mirroring on a computer using IDE drives and
the master drive on the Primary channel fails, the system may appear to
stop responding. You may also experience very erratic mouse movement. This
can happen even if the system drive is configured as master on the primary
EIDE controller and shadow drive is configured as master on the secondary
EIDE controller.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When your computer is running Windows NT, the ATAPI device driver continues
to request communication to the primary EIDE device on the master channel.
This process will eventually timeout and Windows NT will then continue
to run by using the primary (shadow) drive on the secondary channel. The
length of this timeout delay depends on the processes running and the
specific hardware in use.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Because of the nature of IDE architecture, the system may appear to stop
responding or erratic mouse movement may occur. This behavior is expected
when a mirrored IDE drive fails.
<P>
If an instantaneous switchover from the primary drive to the shadow drive
of the mirror set is desired, then switching to a SCSI-based disk subsystem
is recommended.
<P>
MORE INFORMATION
 
<P>
When the original system or boot drive fails, you will have to use a
Windows NT boot floppy disk to start from the shadow partition or
reconfigure the shadow disk drive as the master disk drive on the primary
controller.
<P>
If the drives are not the same geometry, then you may still not be able to
boot off the shadow drive even when moved to the primary drive's position
on the IDE channel.
<P>

</PRE>NOTE: Software mirroring with Windows NT does NOT mirror Master Boot
Record/Partition Table entries. This is because software mirroring is only
designed to mirror a partition's data, and cannot guarantee boot capability
of the Shadow (mirrored) drive. Thus, you should always have a valid
Windows NT Fault Tolerant boot floppy disk created in the event the Primary
drive fails.
<P>
Fault Tolerance is not a replacement for regular backups.
