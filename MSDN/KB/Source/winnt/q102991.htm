<P><h2>SCSI Miniport Driver Entries</h2>
 
<P>
The basic SCSI miniport driver entries in the Registry are found under
subkeys in the following path:
<P>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
<P>
Each subkey’s name is the same as the driver’s filename minus the .SYS
filename extension; for example, FD8XX, which is the entry for all Future
Domain 800-series SCSI adapter. The Registry includes entries for at least
the following SCSI miniport device drivers:
<P>
<P>
<PRE>Driver      Description
name

Ahaxxx      Adaptec 154x and 174x SCSI adapters
DptScsi     DPT SCSI adapter
Fd16_700,   Future Domain MCS 600/MCS 700, TMC-
 Fd7000ex,  7000ex, and 800-series SCSI adapters
 Fd8xx
Ncr53c9x,   NCR SCSI controller and adapters
 Ncrc700,
 Ncrc710
Oliscsi     Olivetti SCSI adapter
Sparrow     SCSI adapter
Spock       SCSI adapter
T128        Trantor SCSI adapters
 and T13B
Ultraxxx    UltraStor 124, 14f, and 24f  SCSI adapter
Wd33c93     Maynard SCSI adapter

</PRE>The contents of a SCSI miniport subkey are standard for all SCSI miniport
drivers, with these basic value entries:
<P>
<PRE>Value entry    Value

ErrorControl   0x01-which is the preferred value for
               ErrorControl. With a value of 0x01,
               the startup process continues if the
               SCSI miniport driver fails to initialize.
Group          SCSI Miniport.
Start          0x00 (Auto Start).
Tag            Optional (determines the load order of
               SCSI miniport drivers).
Type           0x01 (device driver).


</PRE>For each SCSI miniport key, there can be one or more subkeys named
Parameters\Device or Parameters\DeviceN, where N = 0, 1, 2, and so on. The
value of N corresponds to the SCSI host adapter number. If the subkey name
is Device, the value is globally defined. If the subkey name is DeviceN,
the value only pertains to the particular SCSI host adapter.
<P>
The SCSI miniport driver recognizes several optional value entries that can
be defined under these subkeys, as described in this section.
<P>
<PRE>InitiatorTargetId     REG_DWORD     Number
</PRE>Sets the SCSI bus host adapter ID. It is used by host adapters that can set
the initiator ID from software.
Default: Uninitialized
<P>
<PRE>MaximumLogicalUnit     REG_DWORD     Number
</PRE>Controls the number of logical units per target controller that are scanned
for by the SCSI miniport driver. Most devices only support one logical
unit, and some devices may fail if more than one logical unit is scanned
for.
Default: 8
<P>
<PRE>ScsiDebug     REG_DWORD     Number
</PRE>This value is used to set the value of the ScsiDebug variable, which
controls the verbosity of DebugPrint, with 0 being the least verbose. This
is used for debugging.
Default: 0
<P>
The following value entries are used to fix problems such as device time-
outs or controller detection errors but will reduce I/O performance. These
value entries can be abbreviated. For example, a value entry of Disable
will cause DisableSynchronousTransfers, DisableTaggedQueuing,
DisableDisconnects, and DisableMultipleRequests to be set.
<P>
NOTE: The system must be restarted before these options take effect.
<P>
<PRE>BreakPointOnEntry     REG_DWORD     0 or 1
</PRE>A DbgBreakPoint() call is immediately made inside of SpParseDevice. This is
used for debugging.
Default: 0 (disabled)
<P>
<PRE>DisableDisconnects     REG_DWORD     0 or 1
</PRE>Disables disconnects on the SCSI bus. It causes all requests to be executed
sequentially.
Default: 1 (enabled)
<P>
<PRE>DisableMultipleRequests     REG_DWORD     0 or 1
</PRE>Prevents the SCSI miniport driver from sending more than one request at a
time per SCSI device.
Default: 1 (enabled)
<P>
<PRE>DisableSynchronousTransfers     REG_DWORD     0 or 1
</PRE>Disables synchronous data transfers on the SCSI bus.
Default: 1 (enabled)
<P>
<PRE>DisableTaggedQueuing     REG_DWORD     0 or 1
</PRE>Disables SCSI-II tagged command queuing on the host adapter.
Default: 1 (enabled)
<P>
<PRE>DriverParameter     Data type is specific to driver     A
</PRE>string
<P>
A pointer to this data is passed to the SCSI miniport driver in a
miniportFindAdapter routine. It is the fourth parameter, ArgumentString. A
miniport driver uses this data to define the IRQ number for the SCSI host
adapter, but other applications for the data are possible.
<P>
The data type for this value is defined by the specific SCSI miniport
driver developer. If the data type is REG_SZ, the Unicode string is
converted to an ANSI string before transferring it to the SCSI miniport
driver.
<P>
These drivers currently use the DriverParameter value entry:
<P>
<PRE>Driver    Values    Meaning

Wd33c93   IRQ=xx;    xx is the IRQ the card should use.
          DMA=yy     Valid values are: 3, 4, 5, 10, 11,
                     12, and 15. The default is 10. yy is
                     the DMA channel the card should use.
                     Valid values are: 5, 6, and 7. The
                     default is 6.
</PRE>Aha154x BusOnTime=xx xx is the bus on time in microseconds
<PRE>                     for the card. Valid values are 2-15.
                     The default is 7. The value is usually
                     adjusted downward when DMA transfers
                     from the Adaptec card are interfering
                     with other DMA transfers.
FD8XX      IRQ=xx    xx is the IRQ the card should use.
                     Valid values are 0, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11,
                     12, 14, 15. This value should match
                     the jumper settings on the card.
                     Numbers 0, 3, and 5 are for the short
                     cards (850, 845); the rest are for the
                     885 card only. A value of 0 indicates
                     the card should not use any interrupts
                     and will poll. The default is 5.
T128       IRQ=xx    xx is the IRQ the card should use.
                     Valid values are: 0, 3, 5, 7 , 10,
                     12, 14, and 15. This value should
                     match the jumper settings on the card.
                     Numbers greater than 7 are for the
                     T128F card only. A value of 0 indicates
                     the card should not use any interrupts
                     and will poll. The default is 5.
T13B       IRQ=xx    xx is the IRQ the card should use.
                     Valid values are 0, 3, 5, and 7. This
                     value should match the jumper settings
                     on the card. A value of 0 indicates
                     the card should not use any interrupts
                     and will poll. The default is 5.
TMV1       IRQ=xx    xx is the IRQ the card should use.
                     Valid values are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
                     10, 11, 12, and 15. The default is 10.


Resource List     REG_FULL_DESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR
</PRE>This parameter is passed to the miniport in the
PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION data structure. This parameter may be used
to initialize memory, ports, interrupts, and the DMA channel.
