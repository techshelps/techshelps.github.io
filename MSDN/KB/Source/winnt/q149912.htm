The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
- Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An alias for an application, file, or folder located on a Windows NT server
can be created on a Macintosh client desktop. If the path to the original
file that the alias is associated with is deleted, corrupted, or moved, the
following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The alias "Alias Title" could not be opened, because the shared disk
   "Shared volume name," which contains the original item, could not be
   found on the network.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error usually occurs when the application or file has been moved or
the "Shared volume name" has been changed. This can be determined by
selecting the alias on the Macintosh desktop and clicking Get Info on the
File menu. The window contains a field called "Original," which represents
the path to the original file or application.
<P>
Make sure the path is still valid and the application or file for which the
alias was created is still there. This can be done by manually mounting the
volume and running the application or file. If the path is different you
can either:

<UL><LI>Correct the path to the file by editing the Volume or Folder names to
   reflect what is listed by the alias.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Delete the alias and re create it using the current path to the file.
<P>
</UL>The original path reflected in the Get Info window on the Macintosh cannot
be edited. The alias must be re-created.
<P>
