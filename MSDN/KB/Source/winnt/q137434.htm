<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When users of then same server-based Mandatory User Profile log on from
various different locations, different default printers may be selected at
different workstations.
<P>
A roving user of a Mandatory User Profile may see different printers
selected as the default printer as the user moves from workstation to
workstation.
<P>
It can be difficult to predict exactly which printer will be selected as
the default.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is caused by incorrect configuration of the server-based Mandatory
User Profile. Specifically, the default printer named in the profile is a
printer set up in Print Manager via "Create Printer" (as opposed to
"Connect to Printer") on the workstation where the profile administrator
last edited the profile, but a printer with this name has not been created
on all the workstations where the profile may be used.
<P>
If a user of the profile logs on at a workstation where the same printer
name is defined, that printer name is selected as the default printer as
expected. However, if a user of the profile logs on at a workstation where
the same printer name is NOT defined, another printer name is selected
instead.
<P>
If different printer names are configured on different workstations, the
printer name selected as the default printer varies from workstation to
workstation.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Modify the Mandatory User Profile to specify a default printer name that is
set up via Print Manager's "Create Printer" facility, and ensure that this
printer name is present on all workstations where the profile is used.
<P>
-or-
<P>
Modify the Mandatory User Profile to specify a default printer that is set
up via Print Manager's "Connect to Printer" facility. If you choose this
option, bear in mind that, for example, a connection to a printer in
Seattle may not be very useful when the user is in New York, and users of
the profile will need to be educated appropriately.
<P>
NOTE: Printer settings in a User Profile can be changed by logging on as a
user of the profile who is also an Administrator, making the required
changes in Print Manager and then using User Profile Editor to save the
changes.
<P>
For more information on Print Manager, User Profile Editor, and setting up
and modifying Mandatory User Profiles, refer to the Concepts and Planning
Guide and the System Guide provided with Windows NT Advanced Server version
3.1 and the Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51.
