The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Not all processes, applications, and .bat files can be started with the AT
command.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In order to run an interactive application by using the AT command, the
application needs to be started with the local system account, and the
"Allow service to interact with desktop" check box must be checked. If the
Schedule service is set to log on as the local system, scheduled jobs
cannot be validated on the network. If you start the schedule service with
a user account, jobs can be validated on the network, but they cannot have
any user interface, because only the local system has sufficient privileges
to allow a service to start a program on the interactive desktop. Unless
16-bit applications have access to the interactive desktop, they most
likely not start as they run under Ntvdm. Therefore, you can have network
access or interactivity with the system (needed by Ntvdm), but not both.
<P>
NOTE: This is by design, for security purposes. You do not want a regular
user to be able to schedule a job that would run when the administrator is
logged on, and use the administrator's credentials.
