The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
By default, when automating the installation of Windows NT Server or
Workstation 4.0 and the system is joining a domain, the Default Domain
Name set in the registry is the domain that owns the machine account.
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT
   \Current Version\Winlogon

   DefaultDomainName: REG_SZ &lt;Domain Name&gt;

</PRE>In many cases, Automatic Administrator Logon is enabled during setup so
additional applications and settings can be configured. In most cases, a
domain account and password are used for the domain that owns the machine
account. By default, there is no way to log on to the local computer if
the computer is joining a domain.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By using Cmdlines.txt and a few other supplied applications with Windows
NT 4.0, it is possible to build an Autolog.reg script that can be imported
into the registry for Automatic Administrator Logon to the local machine
account rather than the domain.
<P>
The following required files ship with Windows NT and are part of the
normal Windows NT installation:
<P>
<PRE>   Findstr.exe
   Qbasic.exe
   Regedit.exe

</PRE><h3>How the Process Works</h3>
 
<P>
During an unattended or automated installation of Windows NT 4.0, the
Unattend.txt answer file will contain the computer name used during the
installation. The answer file is parsed at the beginning of setup and
additional setup information is appended to a new file and saved as
$WinNT$.inf in the %systemroot%\system32 directory.
<P>
Through the use of Findstr.exe, the line containing the computer name can
be exported to a single line text file. Through the use of a simple
Microsoft QuickBasic program, the text file is read and manipulated to get
the actual computer name and writes a REGEDIT4 compatible registry file.
<P>
After the registry file is written, it can be imported into the Windows NT
registry using Regedit.exe.
<P>
To take advantage of the local logon option during the Windows NT
automated installation process, the following information must be
configured.

<OL><P><LI>You will need an Unattend.txt file that is configured to install
   Windows NT 4.0.

<P><LI>The option OEMPreInstall = Yes must be added to the [unattended]
   section in the answer file.

<P><LI>Create an I386 directory on a server and copy the files from the I386
   directory of the Windows NT 4.0 compact disc to the I386 directory on
   the server.

<P><LI>Under the I386 directory on the server, create a directory called
   $OEM$.

<P><LI>Paste the following lines of code into a text editor and save as
   Autolog.bas to the $OEM$ directory.
<P>
   Note: Some Lines are wrapped for formatting purposes of the article.
<P>
<P><PRE>      OPEN "AUTOLOG.TXT" FOR INPUT AS #1
      INPUT #1, a$
      b$ = MID$(a$, 17)
      c$ = MID$(b$, 1, (LEN(b$) - 1))
      CLOSE #1
      OPEN "AUTOLOG.REG" FOR OUTPUT AS #1
      PRINT #1, "REGEDIT4"
      PRINT #1, ""
      PRINT #1, "[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
      NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon]"
      PRINT #1, CHR$(34) + "DefaultUserName" + CHR$(34) + "=" + CHR$(34) +
      "Administrator" + CHR$(34)
      PRINT #1, CHR$(34) + "AutoAdminLogon" + CHR$(34) + "=" + CHR$(34) +
      "1" + CHR$(34)
      PRINT #1, CHR$(34) + "DefaultPassword" + CHR$(34) + "=" + CHR$(34) +
      CHR$(34)
      PRINT #1, CHR$(34) + "DefaultDomainName" + CHR$(34) + "=" + CHR$(34)
      + c$ + CHR$(34)
      CLOSE #1
      END
</PRE>
<P><LI>Using a text editor create or modify the Cmdlines.txt file to add:
   ".\AUTOLOG.CMD" line under [commands] and save it to the $OEM$
   directory.
<P>
   To save time you can copy the following two lines of information to
   create the required Cmdlines.txt.
<P>
<P><PRE>      [commands]
      ".\AUTOLOG.CMD"
</PRE><P>
   If you have an existing Cmdlines.txt do not copy the [Commands] line
   since an existing Cmdlines.txt file already has this line.

<P><LI>A batch job called Autolog.cmd needs to be created and placed in the
   $OEM$ directory.
<P>
   The following commands make up the Autolog.cmd batch job.
<P>
<P><PRE>      @echo off
      CLS
      findstr.exe /C:ComputerName %systemroot%\system32\$winnt$.inf &gt;
      autolog.txt
      START QBASIC.EXE /RUN .\AUTOLOG.BAS
      :TOP
      IF NOT EXIST AUTOLOG.REG GOTO TOP
      START /WAIT REGEDIT.EXE /S .\AUTOLOG.REG
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The third and fourth lines in the Autolog.cmd listed above should
   be entered as one line. They are wrapped here for readability.
<P>
   It is important not to modify any of the command lines by adding or
   deleting the START or START /WAIT options. The sequences used are to
   ensure events happen in a specific order and time.
<P>
   The Findstr.exe command parses out the line ComputerName to a text file
   into the $OEM$ directory during setup. This is done to keep the
   Microsoft QuickBasic program as simple as possible.
<P>
   The Autolog.bas program opens Autolog.txt and parses out the actual
   computer name for the computer and writes a registry-compatible script
   to enable the Automatic Administrator Logon.
<P>
   The IF NOT EXIST line basically tests for the Autolog.reg file presence
   before importing. After the file is written and the Autolog.bas
   finishes, Regedit.exe will run and import the registry script.

<P><LI>During GUI mode setup, an MS-DOS command window will appear that is
   normally not on the screen during setup. This is by design and will
   terminate normally at the end of setup.
<P>
</OL><h2>ADDITIONAL INFORMAITON</h2>
 
<P>
The example given is provided as a working example and does not require
any additional software outside of the components supplied with Windows NT
Workstation 4.0 or Server 4.0. The process could be enhanced through the
use of C++ or Visual Basic to build a standalone utility, if desired.
<P>
For additional information on the Windows NT 4.0 Power Toys, consult the
Microsoft Windows NT Server Resource Kit Version 4.0, Supplement One
online documentation.
<P>
You can also download the Windows NT 4.0 Deployment Guide from:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation">http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation.</A></B>

</PRE></OL>Note that the deployment guide is valid for both Windows NT Workstation
and Windows NT Server.
