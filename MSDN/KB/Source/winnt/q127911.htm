<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to establish trusts among a number of domains using
User Manager for Domains, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot create this file when this file already exists

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you attempt establish a trust with a domain that
has the same domain security identification (SID) information as another
domain that is already trusted, or has the same local Domain SID. This
problem occurs when you:

<UL><LI>Rename a domain and the trust to the previous name is still in a
   trust relationship.

<LI>Split a single domain into two domains by simply renaming the
   domain on some backup domain controller (BDC) and promoting it to a
   primary domain controller (PDC). In this case both domains have the
   same Domain SID.

<LI>Create two domains through an automated process. For example, you
   install Windows NT once on a PDC and then performing a disk-to-disk copy
   to another identical computer, and then change the domain name.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<UL><LI>If a domain is renamed and previous trust relationships still exist,
   break all trusts established by the previous domain, and re-create
   the trusts for the new domain.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Reinstall all domain controllers in one of the domains (consider using a
   smaller domain). After you re-install the domain controllers, change the
   security on all objects which give permissions to objects in that
   domain.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A domain SID is generated during installation when you decide if you want
the newly installed computer to be the PDC of a new domain. If there is
no domain reachable on the network with that domain name, a new SID is
generated. If you decide you want the computer to be a BDC, it browses
the network for a PDC of a domain with that name and use that same domain
SID. Once a SID is generated for a domain it does not change. This means
that if you change a domain's name, it retains the same domain SID.
