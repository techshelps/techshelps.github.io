</PRE><h3>Overview of Windows Sockets</h3>
 
Microsoft TCP/IP includes support for Windows Sockets on Microsoft Windows
and Workgroups for Windows workstations. A socket provides an end point to
a connection; two sockets form a complete path. A socket works as a bi-
directional pipe for incoming and outgoing data. The Windows Sockets API is
a networking API tailored for use by programmers using the Microsoft
Windows operating system. Windows Sockets is a public specification based
on Berkeley UNIX sockets and aims to:
<P>
*  Provide a familiar networking API to programmers using Windows
<PRE>   or UNIX.
</PRE>*  Offer binary compatibility between heterogeneous Windows-based
<PRE>   TCP/IP stack and utilities vendors.
</PRE>*  Support both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.
<P>
If you are running an application that uses Windows Sockets, be sure to
enable Windows Sockets when you configure Microsoft TCP/IP. If you are
unsure whether any of your applications use Windows Sockets, refer to the
documentation included with that vendor's application.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Setting DNR and Sockets Settings</h3>
 
If you specify the MS TCP/IP protocol during setup, you will now see an
additional dialog box after you have used the Advanced button in the MS-
TCP/IP Configuration dialog box. This new dialog box, DNR and Sockets
Settings, is used only if your MS TCP/IP network has a domain name
service(DNS) server. If your network has a DNS and you choose to configure
the Domain Name Resolver (DNR) parameters, the DNR module will be loaded
with your sockets and Telnet applications to resolve hostname-to-IP address
mappings. This allows you to specify remote computers by computername
without knowing specific IP addresses. If you use this dialog box, these
are the values you will need to supply:
<P>
Username
Your username.
<P>
Hostname
<PRE>  The computername your workstation will report when using the remote
  services. The default is your LAN Manager computername.

</PRE>Primary Nameserver IP Address
<PRE>  The IP address of the DNS server you want the DNR to consult first
  when resolving computername-to-IP address mappings.

</PRE>Secondary Nameserver IP Address
<PRE>  The IP address of the DNS server you want the DNR to consult when
  resolving computername-to-IP address mappings if the request to the
  primary nameserver fails.

</PRE>Domain Name Suffix
<PRE>  The suffix appended to any computername for DNS processing. Your
  network administrator can tell you what to enter here.

</PRE>Enable Windows Sockets
<PRE>  Mark this checkbox if you want Sockets to be invoked from the
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

</PRE>Number of Sockets
<PRE>  The maximum number of sockets that can be made available to
  applications at any one time. The range is 1 to 22 sockets.

</PRE>NOTE: Some applications may use more than one socket to provide a service.
Consider this when trying to maximize available memory. The total number of
sockets and NetBIOS sessions combined must not exceed 22.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>If Microsoft RPC Is Installed</h3>
 
<P>
If Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is installed on your system, you
must copy RPC16C3.DLL from the \DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\TCPIP directory of the DOS
DRIVERS 2 disk to your WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory in order for Windows
Sockets to work properly with Microsoft TCP/IP.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Using Windows for Workgroups and the Remote Access Service (RAS)</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Windows for Workgroups 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
If you plan to connect to the network using only Remote Access and a modem,
click the Cancel button when Windows for Workgroups Setup prompts you for
the type of network adapter you have. Windows for Workgroups will give you
several warning messages informing you that network functionality cannot be
provided without network adapters. Disregard these messages if you plan to
install Remote Access later. The Remote Access Setup program installs the
device drivers required by Remote Access.
<P>
NOTE: If you plan to use a network adapter card and Remote Access at the
same time, install the appropriate Windows for Workgroups network drivers.
<P>
<P>
Installing RAS on a Workstation Configured for both
LAN Manager and Windows for Workgroups
 
<P>
Remote Access files are installed in your Windows for Workgroups directory
by default if the directory is present in your path. If you want Remote
Access to be installed in the LAN Manager directory on a computer that has
valid installations of both LAN Manager 2.2 and Windows for Workgroups,
temporarily delete the Windows for Workgroups directory from the path
statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and reboot the computer before running
Remote Access Setup. After RAS has been installed, be sure to replace the
Windows for Workgroups directory in the path statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Windows for Workgroups and MS-DOS Workgroup Connection</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running Windows for Workgroups or MS-DOS Workgroup Connection,
you do not need to install LAN Manager before installing Remote Access.
<P>
No references to rasload apply to installations running Windows for
Workgroups or MS-DOS Workgroup Connection. To load the Remote Access
service, run Remote Access Setup. For instructions about running Setup, see
the Microsoft LAN Manager Remote Access Service Administrator’s Guide.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Not Enough Memory for Setup</h3>
 
If you don't have enough memory to install Remote Access service by running
Setup on the Remote Access Setup disk, you can install it with wfwsetup for
Windows for Workgroups and MS-DOS Workgroup Connection, or lmrsetup for LAN
Manager. This procedure requires about 35 kilobytes (K) less random access
memory (RAM).To run setup this way, insert the Remote Access Setup disk
into drive A, and follow the appropriate step:
<P>
*  From the Windows File Manager, change to drive A and click
<PRE>   WFWSETUP.EXE or LMRSETUP.EXE, whichever applies.
</PRE>*  From the command line, type
<PRE>      a:wfwsetup
   Or type
      a:lmrsetup

</PRE><h3>Avoiding the Delay from Browsing Domains</h3>
 
When you click the Connect Network Drive button on the Windows for
Workgroups File Manager, all domains on the network are browsed. When
accessing the network through the Remote Access Service, browsing all
domains can cause an unwanted delay if you already know what share you want
to connect to. To avoid browsing and therefore eliminate the delay, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Connect to the share from the command line by typing the net use command
   followed by the drive letter, server name, and share name. The syntax
   is:
<P>
<P><PRE>      net use x: \\servername\sharename
</PRE>
<P><LI>Once you've connected, refresh the File Manager display to see the drive
   letter you assigned to your share. To refresh the display, pull down the
   Windows menu and click Refresh, or press the F5 key.
<P>
</OL><h3>Reinstalling Remote Access</h3>
 
You must remove and then reinstall Remote Access Service, using Setup,
under the following circumstances:
<P>
*  If you are running Windows for Workgroups or MS-DOS Workgroup
<PRE>   Connection and you encounter problems relating to configuration
   files.

   NOTE: In this case, error messages that refer to LAN Manager
   configuration files do not apply. However, error messages dealing
   with Remote Access configuration files, modem errors, and so on
   still apply to both Windows for Workgroups and MS-DOS
   Workgroup Connection.

</PRE></OL>*  If you upgrade from MS-DOS Workgroup Connection to
<PRE>   Windows for Workgroups.

</PRE><h3>Modifying Configuration</h3>
 
To modify the Remote Access configuration:
<P>
<PRE>    Platform                                Procedure

Windows for Workgroups               Click the Remote Access icon on
                                     the control panel.

MS-DOS Workgroup Connection          Run Remote Access Setup from
                                     the DOS\RAS directory.

</PRE>To save RAM, both VCOMMIOD.EXE and WANTSR.EXE can be loaded high, assuming
you have a configuration that allows terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
programs to be loaded high. Find the following lines in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\WINDOWS\ras\vcommiod.exe
   C:\WINDOWS\ras\wantsr.exe

</PRE>Change them to:
<P>
<PRE>   loadhigh C:\WINDOWS\ras\vcommiod.exe
   loadhigh C:\WINDOWS\ras\wantsr.exe


</PRE><h3>Using NetBEUI</h3>
 
If you are using both NetBEUI (to use the local network) and RAS (to access
a remote network), you need to be using the real mode version of NetBEUI
rather than the protect mode version that is normally loaded when the
Windows operating system is started. To use the real mode version, issue
the command net start netbeui before starting the Windows operating system.
If your local network does not require the NetBEUI protocol, this is not a
problem.
<P>
The real mode NetBEUI will take up space in the real mode stack. If this is
a problem, you can disable RAS and allow the protect mode NetBEUI to be
loaded when the Windows operating system is started. This will allow you to
use the local network, but not RAS. To use RAS again you must re-enable RAS
and then either explicitly load NetBEUI before starting the Windows
operating system or not use local area network resources that require the
use of NetBEUI. You can disable RAS from within Windows or from the command
line.
<P>
*  To disable RAS from within the Windows operating system
<PRE>   1. Choose the Remote Access icon from the Control Panel.
   2. Clear the Enable Remote Access checkbox.
   3. Reboot your computer.

</PRE>*  To disable RAS from the Command Line
<PRE>   1. Go to the RAS subdirectory of the WINDOWS directory by
      typing a command such as cd c:\windows\ras.
   2.Start the RAS setup program by typing setup.
   3. Clear the Enable Remote Access checkbox.
   4. Reboot your computer.


</PRE><h3>Using Modems with Advanced Features</h3>
 
If you have a modem that can do hardware data compression, or supports
speeds above 19.2K baud, use the alternate modem configuration file that
enables these advanced features. The file is MCOMP.INF. Use the following
procedure to access advanced modem features.
<P>
*  To use the advanced features of the modem:
<PRE>   1. Insert the Remote Access Setup disk into drive A.
   2. Go to your Windows directory if you are using Windows
      for Workgroups, or to your LAN Manager root directory.
   3. Rename the MODEMS.INF file to a temporary filename such
      as MODEMS.OLD.
   4. Copy the new file using the following command:

         copy a:mcomp.inf modems.inf

   5.  Run the RAS Setup program again and select the your modem
       from the list of modems. If the modem does not appear in
       the list of modems, the advanced features are not supported
       on that particular modem. In this case, exit RAS Setup copy
       MODEMS.OLD (or whatever you renamed it to) back to MODEMS.INF
       and run the RAS Setup program again to select the appropriate
       modem.

   6.  Exit RAS Setup and reboot the computer.


</PRE><h3>Creating New Modem Sections</h3>
 
When creating new modem sections, be sure to
<PRE>  *  set the modem to always report DTE speed (port to modem speed)
     instead of the DCE speed (modem to modem speed)
  *  set modem to NOT report negotiation progress.


</PRE><h3>Turning Compression On or Off</h3>
 
The following modems should turn off compression when connecting to
OS/2 based RAS 1.x servers, and turn on compression when connecting
to NT base RAS servers.
<PRE>  *  Codex 3220 Plus
  *  Codex 326x FAST series
  *  US Robotics Courier modems
  *  UDS 3229


</PRE><h3>DSI 9624LE Modems</h3>
 
The DSI 9624LE modem will only work when connected at high speed
(9600 baud or greater). Do not use this modem if connecting at
4800 or lower speed.
