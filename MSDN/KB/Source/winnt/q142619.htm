The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Unattended setup of network cards from the Drvlib directory of the Windows
NT compact discs requires that you copy the network adapter setup files to
a separate directory and specify the path to Oemsetup.inf in the unattended
setup answer file.
<P>
This article describes a method for including network cards from the Drvlib
directory in the Windows NT distribution files on a network share so that
they are part of the default available network adapters at setup time.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Modification of Setup files can cause serious, system-wide
problems before and after Setup and may require you to reinstall Windows NT
to correct them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting
from the modification of the Setup files can be solved. Make Setup file
modifications at your own risk.
<P>
In the following procedure, assume that drive D is the CD-ROM drive and
drive X is a network share from which you run unattended installations:

<OL><P><LI>At a command prompt, type the following to copy the Windows NT
   distribution files to a network share:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy d:\i386\*.* x:\
</PRE>
<P><LI>At a command prompt, type the following commands to copy the network
   adapter related files:
<P>
<P><PRE>      d:
      cd \drvlib\netcard\x86\&lt;nicname&gt;
      copy *.* x:\
      x:
      cd \
      rename oemsetup.inf oemnadxx.inf
</PRE><P>
   Note that &lt;nicname&gt; is the name of the subdirectory of the Drvlib
   directory that matches the network adapter.
<P>
   Because all network adapter setup script files are called Oemnad*.inf,
   you need to choose a name Oemnadxx.inf that does not already exist in
   the Windows NT compact disc distribution files (for example,
   Oemnad3c.inf for a 3Com adapter).
<P>
   Oemnadxx.inf will refer to this file and xx.sys will refer to the driver
   file name.

<P><LI>During the first phase of unattended setup, all system files are
   temporarily copied to C:\$Win_nt$.~LS and C:\$Win_nt$.~BT. Dosnet.inf
   describes the files that have to be copied. You must modify Dosnet.inf
   so that all the necessary files are included.
<P>
   Edit X:\Dosnet.inf at the end of the [Files] section, and add one line
   for the INF file and one line per existing file under
   Drvlib\netcard\x86\&lt;nicname&gt;
<P>
<P><PRE>      d1,OEMNADxx.INF
<PRE></PRE>      d1,&lt;nicdrv&gt;.SYS        &lt;replace with the proper file name&gt;
      d1,file1

   and so on for all other existing files under the subdirectory
   described above.

</PRE><P><LI>Txtsetup.sif is used during the text mode phase of the unattended setup.
   It tells the setup process which files have to be copied to the hard
   disk. You must modify the Txtsetup.sif file: at the end of the [Files]
   section, add the following line for the setup information file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Oemnadxx.inf = dx,d7,,2,0,0
</PRE><P>
   Add a line for the network adapter driver so that it will be copied
   to System32\drivers directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      xxDRV.sys = dx,d19,,4,1
</PRE><P>
   For all other files xx.xxx in the Drvlib\Netcard\x86\&lt;nicname&gt;
   directory, add a line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      xx.xxx = dx,d4,,2,0,0
</PRE><P>
   These files will be copied to the System32 directory.

<P><LI>Oemnadzz.inf is a global setup script file that includes the definition
   of all network adapters from Drvlib directory. Because you want to use
   the OemnadXX.inf file that was copied on the flat distribution files,
   not the Oemsetup.inf file from Drvlib\netcard directory, the matching
   option in Oemnadzz.inf must be disabled. To do this, run the following
   batch commands at the command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      x:
      cd \
      attrib -r oemnadzz.in_
      expand -r oemnadzz.in_
      del oemnadzz.in_
</PRE><P>
   Edit Oemnadzz.inf and comment out all lines including a network adapter
   option defined in the Oemsetup.inf [Options] section. To comment a
   line, place a semicolon (;) in front of it.
<P>
   For example, 3C595 and 3C590 are the options to disable for the 3Com PCI
   adapter defined in the Drvlib\Netcard\x86\el59x directory.

<P><LI>The Oemsetup.inf setup script files in the Drvlib directory do not
   support the unattended setup mode. During an unattended setup, the
   global variable !STF_GUI_UNATTENDED is set to yes and setup script
   files test its value to determine whether the network adapter
   information has to be retrieved from Unattend.txt.
<P>
   To prevent user interaction during Setup, modify the OemnadXX.inf file.
   For additional information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q143134.htm">Q143134</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : OEMSETUP.INF Modifications for Automated Windows NT Setup

</PRE><P><LI>The unattended setup answer file (Unattend.txt) includes a line to refer
   to the right network adapter option:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [NetworkAdapterData]
      !AutoNetOption = "&lt;OEMNIC&gt;"
</PRE><P>
   You can also use the [AdapterParameters] section if you follow the
   instructions provided in the Knowledge Base article referenced in
   step 6.
<P>
   You are now able to run X:\Winnt32 /U:X:\Unattend.txt.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The unattended setup answer file (Unattend.txt) includes a section for the
network adapter information. (Please refer to the default Unattend.txt file
for more details.)
<P>
To install a network adapter from the Drvlib directory, you must copy all
the related network adapter files from the Drvlib directory to a directory
C:\Oem. Then Unattend.txt includes a section similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   [NetworkAdapterData]
   !AutoNetOption = "&lt;OEMNIC&gt;"
   !OEMNetOption = YES
   !OEMNetDrive = C:\OEM\
   !OEMNetInfFile = C:\OEM\oemsetup.inf
