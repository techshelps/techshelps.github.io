<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can assign permissions associated with an individual user or a
group account to any directory on an NTFS partition by using the
Permissions command, which is accessed from the Security menu in File
Manager.
<P>
If you want to deny a user or group access to a directory and all
files included in that directory, select the No Access setting. If you
do not want to automatically permit or deny a user or group permission
to files in that directory, select Access Not Specified setting. (You
can specify this by selecting Special File Access and then selecting
the Access Not Specified setting.) Access Not Specified may or may not
keep a user or group from using a file included in that directory,
depending on other permissions that protect the file. Selecting Access
Not Specified not only removes permissions for the user or group from
the permissions list of each file included in the directory, but it
also prevents permissions from being given on files later added to the
directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Suppose you create a directory called Test, assign Read access to a
subgroup called Support, and then assign Access Not Specified to the
Everyone group. Members of the Support group would have Read access to
all files in Test, but all other members of the Everyone group would
be denied access to the files in Test. This is because no permissions
on the directory have been established for members of the Everyone
group, with the exception of the subgroup called Support. If you
change the type of access for the Everyone group on the Test directory
to No Access while maintaining the Read access given to the group
Support, even members of Support are denied access to the files
included in the Test directory.
