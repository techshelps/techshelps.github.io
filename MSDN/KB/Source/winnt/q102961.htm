The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<P>
</UL>The article contains REGISTRY entries for Microsoft Mail, Part 1. These
subgroups are included:

<UL><LI>Address Book Entries for Mail
<LI>Custom Commands Entries for Mail
<LI>Custom Messages Entries for Mail
<LI>Custom Menus Entries for Mail
</UL> 
<P>
This is the first of three articles on the MS Mail entries; for the other
entries, see "Microsoft Mail Entries, Part 2" and "Microsoft Mail Entries,
Part 3".
<P>
<P><h2>REGISTRY ENTRIES FOR MICROSOFT MAIL</h2>
 
<P>
The parameters used by the Microsoft Mail application provided with Windows
NT appear under this subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail

</PRE>This key includes the following subkeys:
<P>
<PRE>Subkey             Purpose
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>Address Book       Secifies entries used by the Address Book support
                   functions for the Mail program.
Custom Commands    Specifies a custom command that can be installed into
                   one of the Mail menus at run-time.
Custom Messages    Specifies a custom message type that is installed into a
                   Mail menu at run-time.
Custom Menus       Specifies a custom menu name to be added to the Mail
                   menu bar.
Microsoft Mail     Defines the configuration of the Mail program, and the
                   Microsoft Mail transport and name service.
MMF                Affects the automatic compression of the Mail message
                   file.
Mac File Types     Defines the mapping from Macintosh file type and creator
                   tags into eight-plus-three character filename
                   extensions.
</PRE>MS Proofing Tools  Defines settings for the speller.
<PRE>Providers          Defines settings that service providers use Microsoft
                   Mail front-end programs.

</PRE>Many of the entries in these subkeys have default values and won’t be
present in the Mail subkeys. To change the appearance and behavior of the
Mail application, use the Mail menu commands instead of editing the Mail
entries directly. Some of the options that you specify in the Mail
application are stored in your mail message file (.MMF) instead of the Mail
Registry entries.
<P>
These keys are created in HKEY_CURRENT_USER when you first run Mail. If
your system previously contained a Windows for MS-DOS version of
MSMAIL.INI, its contents are migrated to the Registry when you first run
Mail under Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>ADDRESS BOOK ENTRIES FOR MAIL</h2>
 
<P>
Entries in this subkey are used by the Address Book support functions in
the Mail program. Most of the entries for this subkey use default values
specified by the Mail program, and the Address Book subkey might not be
present under the Mail key. The entries in this subkey control the default
address directory displayed in the Address Book. Do not change any of these
entries if they appear.
<P>
This is the Registry path for this subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Address Book

</PRE><h2>CUSTOM COMMANDS ENTRIES FOR MAIL</h2>
 
<P>
Each entry under this key specifies a custom command that can be installed
into one of the Mail menus at run-time. These entries can appear both in
the Microsoft Mail key and in the SHARED32.INI file in the directory
defined under the Microsoft Mail subkey as the value of
SharedExtensionsDir.
<P>
This is the Registry path for this subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Custom Commands

</PRE>The Custom Commands subkey can contain one or more of the following
entries:
<P>
<P><h3>tag   REG_SZ</h3>
 
<P>
This specifies the descriptive identifier for the command in the
following format:
<P>
<PRE>   tag= version;menu;name;position;DLL name, ordinal;command;
        event map;status text;Help file;help context;

</PRE>For example:
<P>
<PRE>   IC1= 3.0;help;&amp;Out of Office;10;&lt;ExtsDir&gt;BIN-EXT\OOF32.DLL;3;;
        Out of Office Email Notification

              accelerator.
position      The zero-relative position within its menu where the command
              is to appear. A menu value of -1 places the command at the
              end of the menu.
DLL           Name or path of the DLL where the custom command resides.
              This entry can optionally be followed by a comma and the
              ordinal of the entry point to call (default is ,1).
command       The command string passed as one of the parameters to the
              DLL entry point for the command.
event map     A sequence of up to 16 digits identifying the Mail events
              that the custom command supports. Each can be 0 or 1 to
              indicate if the DLL is to be called for a specific event.
              Currently, three events are defined; the rest are reserved
              and must be zero (or, as in the examples above) this whole
              section can be empty:
                 The first digit means Mails startup.

              Mail key. used to refer to DLLs that are installed in a
              shared network. Valid fo the Dll name, command, and Help
              file subfields.

</PRE><h2>CUSTOM MESSAGES ENTRIES FOR MAIL</h2>

entry specifies a custom message type to be installed into a Mail menu at
run-time.
<P>
These entries can appear both in the Microsoft Mail key and in the
SHARED32.INI file in the directory defined by the SharedExtensionsDir entry
under the Microsoft Mail key.
<P>
This is the Registry path for this subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Custom Messages

</PRE>The Custom Messages subkey can contain one or more of the following
entries.
<P>
<PRE>class   REG_SZ
</PRE> 
<P>
Specifies a string uniquely identifying the message type. Mail places this
