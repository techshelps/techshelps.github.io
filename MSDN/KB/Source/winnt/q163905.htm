<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51,and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT can audit when a user or group is added to or removed from a
User Right. To audit these types of action, choose the auditing category,
Security Policy Changes in User Manager under the Policies menu, auditing.
This is the only needed audit category to audit these specific actions.
Only the audit category File and Object Access will add additional security
events, but these events simply show objects being opened and handles being
closed for user account access that populate the Add Users and Groups
dialog boxes.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Below is the sample output from the Security Event Log when a user is added
to each of the User Right. Although User Manger does not differentiate
between User Privileges and Rights, in actuality only Privileges are
currently audited. Actions that are not audited are actually "rights."
