The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You do not receive audio from your Crystal Semiconductor audio chip or
Creative Labs SoundBlaster AWE32 PnP Wavetable Synthesizer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur for either of the following reasons:

<UL><LI>You ran PnPISA from the Windows NT 4.0 CD (or any of the Service
   Packs) and selected "Do not install a driver (Windows NT will not prompt
   you again)."

<LI>The Creative Labs Advanced Wavetable Effects (AWE) Synthesizer is
   installed and a Windows NT driver was not available when you were
   prompted to use the Windows NT default driver. In this scenario, Do Not
   Install Driver was chosen automatically.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can resolve this problem by obtaining the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3
CD-ROM or by downloading Service Pack 3. For information on obtaining the
latest Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h3>Service Pack 3 - CD-ROM Version</h3>
 
<P>
Using the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 CD-ROM, perform the following steps
to correct this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Start a command prompt.

<P><LI>Go to the folder on the Service Pack 3 CD-ROM for your architecture
   (for example, i386 for Intel.)

<P><LI>Type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      devpre devupd.inf
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Devpre does not support UNC paths. You must map a network drive if
   you are attaching to the Service Pack 3 CD-ROM across a network.

<P><LI>A dialog box titled Windows NT Setup reads "Setup is examining your
   computer's hardware."

<P><LI>You may receive a prompt for the path of your audio drivers.
<P>
   a. Enter the path name to the Service Pack 3 CD-ROM for the Audio
<P><PRE>      driver.
</PRE><P>
   b. Click OK on the Select Device screen.
<P>
   c. If you are not presented with resource settings, click Set
<P><PRE>      Configuration Manually.
</PRE><P>
   d. If there are conflicting devices at the bottom of the screen, resolve
<P><PRE>      them first by selecting a basic configuration that allows the
      selection of resources that do not conflict with devices already
      installed.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      To change resources, highlight the offending setting in the Resource
      Settings window, click Change Setting and select a setting that does
      not conflict with another device, and then click OK. Repeat for any
      settings that show a conflict.
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you receive a prompt for any other functions, follow the previous
   steps.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.

<P><LI>Your audio card should be working properly at this point. If you need to
   change the resources that your card is using, open the Multimedia
   utility in Control Panel, click the Devices tab, click Properties for
   the Crystal Semiconductor driver or the Creative Labs SoundBlaster Plug
   and Play driver, and then click Settings. This opens the same resource
   dialog box that was invoked when installing the device.
<P>
</OL><h3>Service Pack 3 - Download Version</h3>
 
<P>
Because the downloadable version of the Service Pack is in CAB format, you
must manually extract the files with the /x switch before running DEVPRE.
Please see the Readme.txt file included with the self-extracting version of
Service Pack 3 for more information.

<OL><P><LI>Start a command prompt.

<P><LI>Create a temporary folder on your hard disk, copy the Service Pack
   executable to this folder, and extract the files contained in the
   Service Pack by typing the name of the executable followed by the
   /x switch:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;Filename&gt; /x
</PRE>
<P><LI>Type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      devpre devupd.inf
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Devpre does not support UNC paths. You must map a network drive if
   you are attaching to the Service Pack 3 CD-ROM across a network.

<P><LI>A dialog box titled Windows NT Setup reads "Setup is examining your
   computer's hardware."

<P><LI>You may receive a prompt for the path of your audio drivers.
<P>
   a. Enter the path name to the Service Pack 3 CD-ROM for the Audio
<P><PRE>      driver.
</PRE><P>
   b. Click OK on the Select Device screen.
<P>
   c. If you are not presented with resource settings, click Set
<P><PRE>      Configuration Manually.
</PRE><P>
   d. If there are conflicting devices at the bottom of the screen, resolve
<P><PRE>      them first by selecting a basic configuration that allows the
      selection of resources that do not conflict with devices already
      installed.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      To change resources, highlight the offending setting in the Resource
      Settings window, click Change Setting and select a setting that does
      not conflict with another device, and then click OK. Repeat for any
      settings that show a conflict.

<P><LI>If you receive a prompt for any other functions, follow the previous
   steps.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.

<P><LI>Your audio card should be working properly at this point. If you need to
