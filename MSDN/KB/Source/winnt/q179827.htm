<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After a fairly long period of continuously using Attachmate Extra V6.3, the
computer displays blue screen errors randomly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These blue screen errors are caused by an application containing a registry
handle leak. This leak occurs because an application continuously reopens a
registry key but never closes it. After this has happened 65,535 times, the
open instance count for this key wraps round to zero making the kernel
think that there is no longer any open handles to this key. The next time
an instance of the key is closed, the storage used by the kernel to
reference the key is deleted.
<P>
However, any time subsequent to this that the key is opened or closed, the
freed storage is written to again. This causes free pool corruption and
eventually the system will crash when this freed storage is referenced in
any way.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next
Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   12/05/97  22:43               919,104 ntoskrnl.exe (Intel)
   12/05/97  22:43               939,072 ntkrnlmp.exe (Intel)
   12/05/97  22:39               1,372,224 ntoskrnl.exe (Alpha)
   12/05/97  22:40               1,399,680 ntkrnlmp.exe (Alpha)

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
