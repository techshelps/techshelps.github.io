The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use duplexed SCSI controllers and a software mirror of either the
operating system partition or a data partition, an "Insufficient space on
drive X" appears where X is the target drive or partition.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur even when you use identical SCSI controllers and
drives but whose BIOS is disabled on the second SCSI controller. When two
identical SCSI controllers are used, the drive geometry is calculated
differently for the controller with the BIOS enabled and the
controller with the BIOS disabled.
<P>
For a controller that has BIOS enabled, the operating system can query the
controller BIOS for drive geometry. The BIOS returns a generic drive
geometry translation. This translation will have a cylinder count of less
than 1024 to work with MS-DOS. The number of heads is normally increased
to arrive at a correct overall size.
<P>
When the second SCSI controller does not have its BIOS enabled, it provides
the operating system with the size of a block (sector size) and the total
number of blocks on the device. Windows NT uses a default translation of 32
tracks per cylinder, 64 heads and adjusts the number of cylinders for a
correct approximate size. Due to the different translations, cylinder
boundaries are located in different places on the drives. This often
results in free space being one or two megabytes (MB) different on the two
identical drives or whatever 1 cylinders worth of data is. Windows NT uses
a LARGE_INTEGER (64-bit) number for the number of cylinders and is not
constrained by MS-DOS or partition table limitations.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Set the translation mode on the primary controller to 32 sectors per
   track and 64 heads (if the SCSI controller supports this translation
   mode).
<P>
 -or-

<LI>Disable the BIOS on the primary SCSI controller and enable it on the
   secondary controller. When you create a mirror, the master boot record
   is not part of the mirror. Therefore, set the active partition byte on
   the new boot drive with MS-DOS FDISK.EXE or a disk sector editor.
   Another method is to boot the computer from a Windows NT boot floppy
   disk. For more information on how to create this boot floppy disk, refer
   to the Windows NT Resource Guide or the Windows NT Concepts and Planning
   Guide.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
