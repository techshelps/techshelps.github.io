The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<P>
</UL>The article contains REGISTRY entries for Subsystems, Part 1. These
subgroups are included:

<UL><LI>Microsoft OS/2 Version 1.x Software Registration Entries
<LI>Windows Software Registration Entries
<LI>WOW Software Registration Entries
<LI>Windows NT Software Registration Entries
</UL> 
<P>
This is the first of two articles on these entries; for the other entries,
see "Registry Entries for Subsystems, Part 2".
<P>
<P><h2>REGISTRY ENTRIES FOR SUBSYSTEMS</h2>
 
<P>
This section describes software registration entries related to Windows NT
subsystems.
<P>
<P><h2>MICROSOFT OS/2 VERSION 1.X SOFTWARE REGISTRATION ENTRIES</h2>
 
<P>
The basic software information for the Microsoft OS/2 version 1.x subsystem
is found in the following Registry path:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\OS/2 Subsystem for NT

</PRE>The OS/2 Subsystem key contains several subkeys, but initially only the
\config.sys subkey contains an entry. This subkey contains the OS/2
CONFIG.SYS information stored after an OS/2 application has been run on the
system.
<P>
If there is no OS/2 CONFIG.SYS file, this subkey contains this entry:
<P>
<PRE>   PROTSHELL=C:\os2\pmshell.exe c:\os2\os2.ini c:\os2\os2sys.ini
             %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe
   SET COMSPEC=%SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe

</PRE>The Os2 subkey under CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\SubSystems
defines the path to the executable file used to start the OS/2 subsystem.
The Os2LibPath value under the Session Manager\Environment subkey defines
the directory path for the OS/2 library.These entries are described in the
article "CurrentControlSet\Control Subkeys".
<P>
<P>
To disable the OS/2 subsystem, set the value of GlobalFlag to 20100000  in
the following subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager

</PRE><h2>WINDOWS SOFTWARE REGISTRATION ENTRIES</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows subkey under the following path defines some values used by
applications created to run under Windows for MS-DOS:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows

AppInit_DLLs   REG_SZ
</PRE> 
Default:
<P>
Causes all the specified DLLs (one or many) to be attached to all Windows-
based applications. This means that once this is set for a session, upon
restarting the system, all the Windows-based applications that run in that
session will load the specified DLLs. For example, an applications
developer can use it to attach the Microsoft Call/Attributive Profiler to
all Windows-based applications by calling CAPSETUP.EXE, which sets the
AppInit_DLLs so the user doesn’t have to do it through Registry Editor.
<P>
<PRE>DeviceNotSelectedTimeout   REG_SZ   Seconds
</PRE> 
Default:  15
<P>
Specifies how much time the system waits for a device to be switched on. If
the device is not switched on during this time, the system won’t print to
the device. For some devices, the system immediately posts an error message
if the device is not already switched on. This entry only defines the
system default value. To change the value for a particular printer, use
Print Manager.
<P>
<PRE>Spooler   REG_SZ   Boolean
</PRE> 
Default:  Yes
<P>
Specifies whether output to the printer is to be sent through Print
Manager. Changing this value to No turns off Print Manager. Used by
applications that look for this value in WIN.INI.
<P>
<PRE>swapdisk   REG_SZ   drive:directory
</PRE> 
<P>
Provides the name of the disk drive and directory to which Windows for MS-
DOS in standard mode swaps non-Windows-based applications. Default: The
directory pointed to by the TEMP environment variable; if there is no TEMP
variable, the default is the boot directory of your first hard disk
(usually C:).
<P>
<PRE>TransmissionRetryTimeout   REG_SZ   Seconds
</PRE> 
Default:  45
<P>
Specifies the default amount of time for attempted transmission retries. If
a successful transmission does not occur during this time, Print Manager
displays a message stating that the printer is not receiving characters.
This setting serves only as the system default value. To change the value
for a particular printer, use Print Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>WOW SOFTWARE REGISTRATION ENTRIES</h2>
 
<P>
Software registration values for the WOW subsystem appear under the
following Registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WOW

</PRE>The WOW subkeys have the same names as headings in the SYSTEM.INI file, and
the values are the same items as were contained in the Windows for MS-DOS
SYSTEM.INI file.  All are REG_SZ value types.
<P>
The information provided here is for troubleshooting only.
<P>
<PRE>WOW asubkey         Description and defaults
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>Boot                Lists drivers and Windows 3.x modules, with these
                    entries and default values to map Windows 3.x drivers
                    to Windows NT.
                    &lt;&lt;Provided for applications that seek this information.
                    Mostly ignored, but drivers are loaded from this
                    source, such as MMSYSTEM.DLL.
                       comm.drv = comm.drv

boot.description       Provided for applications that seek this
                       information. Not actually used by the WOW subsystem.
                       Lists names of devices that can be changed using
                       Windows 3.x Setup, with these kinds of entries and
                       default values.
                          display.drv = VGA
                          keyboard.typ = Enhanced 101/102 key U.S. and
                          non U.S. keyboards
                          language.dll = English (American)
                          network.drv = LAN support
                          system.drv = MS-DOS or PC-DOS System
Compatibility          Used to translate 16-bit Windows APIs and messages
                       to 32-bit equivalents.
                          MAILSPL = 0x40000000 (for MS Mail)
                          SHOPPER = 0x20000000  (for Clip-Art Windows
                          Shopper)
                          SHADOW = 0x10000000  (for BeyondMail
                          installation)
                          WINPROJ = 0x80000000  (for Microsoft Project)
                          ESCAPES = 0x1000000 (for Micrographix Escapes)
                          HIRES=0x00100000 (fro HIRES display cards
Keyboard               Contains information about the keyboard, provided
                       for applications that seek this information, with
                       these kinds of entries and default values:
                          keyboard.dll = (empty)
                          subtype = (empty)
                          type=4
NonWindowsAPP          Contains information used by non-Windows- based
                       applications. This is handled automatically by
                       Windows NT. Unless you manually added values to
                       SYSTEM.INI in Windows 3.x, this subkey is empty.
Standard               Contains entries specific to running Windows 3.x in
                       standard mode. Unless you manually added values to
                       SYSTEM.INI in Windows 3.x, this subkey is empty.

</PRE>The [386Enh] section is read from the SYSTEM.INI file for 16-bit Windows-
based applications that need it. There is no Registry equivalent, because
Windows NT ignores this information.
<P>
