The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh workstation, version 3.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Macintosh client is designed to be used in conjunction with Microsoft
Mail Server; however, it is also possible to use Windows NT Mail
(MSMAIL32.EXE) to establish a postoffice that is usable by both PC and
Macintosh clients through Services for Macintosh (SFM).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following two versions of Microsoft Mail for the Macintosh are
available:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks
<LI>Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh workstation, version 3.0
<P>
</UL>To gain enterprise mail connectivity between PCs and Macintoshes when using
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks and Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks,
you must also use the Microsoft Mail Connection gateway.
<P>
NOTE: For details on the Microsoft Mail Connection gateway hardware and
software requirements and installation instructions, see your Microsoft
Mail and Microsoft Mail Connection manuals.
<P>
To gain mail connectivity between PCs and Macintoshes in smaller networking
environments without the additional software and hardware requirements
mentioned above, you can use the Macintosh client in conjunction with
Windows NT Mail.
<P>
The Macintosh client is included in the following products.
<P>
- Microsoft Mail Server Version 3.2
- Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Extensions (also known as the Postoffice
<PRE>  Upgrade for Microsoft Windows for Workgroups)

</PRE>For pricing and availability information on the above products, call
Microsoft Sales Information Services (MSIC) at 800-426-9400.
<P>
To establish mail connectivity between PCs and Macintoshes using Windows NT
Mail and the Macintosh client, configure the computer running Windows NT
Server as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Run User Manager for Domains and create user accounts for the Macintosh
   clients. For details about how to use User Manager for Domains, see your
   Windows NT Server System Guide.

<P><LI>Run Control Panel, choose Network, and install Services for Macintosh
   (SFM).

<P><LI>If you have already started Windows NT Mail for the first time on the
   Windows NT server, and the workgroup postoffice is already on an Windows
   NT file system (NTFS) partition, skip to step 6 below.

<P><LI>If you have already started Windows NT Mail for the first time to
   establish a workgroup postoffice on the Windows NT server, and the
   workgroup postoffice is not already on an NTFS partition, proceed with
   the following steps and then skip to step 6 below.
<P>
   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious,
   system-wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT
   to correct them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems
   resulting from the use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this
   tool at your own risk.
<P>
   a. Move the workgroup postoffice directory structure (the root
<P><PRE>      is named WGPO by default) to an NTFS volume.
</PRE><P>
   b. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).
<P>
   c. From the HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<PRE>         \Software\Microsoft\Mail\Microsoft Mail

   d. Modify the ServerPath value to reflect the new postoffice location.

   e. Ensure the share established for the workgroup postoffice is active
      and reflecting the appropriate path.

</PRE><P><LI>If you have not yet started Windows NT Mail for the first time on
   computer running Windows NT Server, start Windows NT Mail and follow the
   on-screen instructions for creating a workgroup postoffice. Create it on
   an NTFS partition.

<P><LI>Run File Manager, select the workgroup postoffice directory (WGPO by
   default), and choose the MacFile menu. Create a Macintosh-accessible
   volume. For details about using the MacFile menu, see your Windows NT
   Server Services for Macintosh guide.

<P><LI>Select the File, Share, and MacFile permissions and set them as follows
   (to ensure that the all Mail users are able to use the workgroup
   postoffice):
<P>
   a. The file permissions should be set such that all Windows NT Mail
<P><PRE>      users have the full control permission to the workgroup postoffice
      root directory (WGPO by default) and all of its subdirectories and
      files.
</PRE><P>
   b. The share permissions should be set such that all Windows NT Mail
<P><PRE>      users have the full control permission to the workgroup postoffice
      share (WGPO by default).
</PRE><P>
   c. The MacFile permissions for the workgroup postoffice volume
<P><PRE>      (WGPO by default) should be set such that all Macintosh client users
      accessing this postoffice have the See Files, See Folders, and
      Make Changes permissions to the workgroup postoffice root
      directory (WGPO by default) and all of its subdirectories
      and files. The volume security should not be set for read-only.
</PRE><P>
</OL>On the Macintosh client, follow the installation instructions found in
Chapter 1 of the Microsoft Mail Workstation Software for the Macintosh
User's Guide to install the Macintosh client.
<P>
<P><h3>Additional Considerations</h3>
 
<P>
When you send a file attachments from a Macintosh client, you can choose
the format that is used to send the file (Mac format or PC format);
however, Windows NT Mail attaches files in PC format only.
<P>
Because the Macintosh client is designed to be used in conjunction with
Microsoft Mail Server, all Macintosh client features may not be available
or function as expected when used in conjunction with a Windows NT Mail
workgroup postoffice.
