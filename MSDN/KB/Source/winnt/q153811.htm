The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOM</h2>
 
<P>
Your Windows NT Server or Workstation may log the following events at
startup:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 8021
   Source: WINS
   Description: The browser was unable to retrieve a list of servers from
   the browser master &lt;PDC&gt; on the network \device\&lt;protocol_netcard&gt;. The
   data is the error code.

   Event ID: 8032
   Source: WINS
   Description: The browser service has failed to retrieve the backup list
   too many times on transport of &lt;protocol_netcard&gt;. The backup browser
   is stopping.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is a problem with one of the installed protocols or the browser
service is not functioning properly on one or more of the installed
protocols.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot this problem, start with one of the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the Control Panel Services tool, stop and start the Computer
   browser.
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>Restart the computer.
<P>
</OL>After either of these steps, wait at least 10 minutes to see if the errors
still occur. If they do, continue troubleshooting by cross-referencing two
pieces of information. The first is to check the transport that failed in
the event log. For example, error 8021 displays a message similar to the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   The browser was unable to retrieve a list of servers from the
   browser master \\&lt;server_name&gt; on the network
   \Device\NetBT_&lt;driver_name&gt;. The data is the error code.

</PRE></OL>The important data is \NetBT_&lt;driver_name&gt;, that indicates the protocol
and netcard binding, also known as an "endpoint." The potential protocols
you may see are:
<P>
<PRE>   Nbf_netcard    =  NetBEUI
   NetBT_netcard  =  TCP/IP (or NetBIOS over TCP/IP)
   NwlnkIpx       =  IPX/SPX (NwLink)    [will not indicate netcard]
   NwlnkNB        =  NetBIOS over NwLink [will not indicate netcard]

</PRE>After you have determined the failed protocol endpoint, check the working
status of the browser service on all installed protocols with the Windows
NT Resource Kit program Browstat.exe. At a command prompt, type the
following command:
<P>
<PRE>   browstat status

</PRE>This will enumerate the browser status on all endpoints. Look for the
message Browser is NOT active on domain under each endpoint. Disregard
data about endpoints that list "NdisWanX" (such as
\Device\NetBT_NdisWan5);
these are RAS endpoints and will usually list the error anyway.
<P>
You should find a protocol match between these two steps. The next step is
to record any important information about the protocol from Protocol Setup
in the Control Panel Network tool. Then remove the protocol, restart the
computer, and see if the error no longer gets logged (remember to wait at
least 10 minutes). Then try reinstalling the protocol, checking for the
error, and reapplying the service pack that exists on the current Windows
NT installation.
<P>
If the error persists after a protocol reinstallation, you may have
problems with the network adapter card. Check with the vendor to see if
there is an updated driver, or try another network adapter card.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The computer running Windows NT does not have to be multihomed for this
problem to occur, and this problem is not localized to any specific
protocol or combination of protocols. Also, this condition may occur if
the browser service functions properly over one protocol, but fails over
another. Thus, your Windows NT system may be getting a partial or complete
browse list as far as you can tell, yet still logging these errors.
