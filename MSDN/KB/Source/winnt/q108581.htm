The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit for Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced
   Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
To successfully execute the VI POSIX Editor that ships with the Windows NT
Resource Kit, you must correctly setup the system environment. The Windows
NT "Resource Kit Tools Help" helpfile does not give all the information
needed to configure VI for use with Windows NT 3.1. To correctly setup VI
for use within Windows NT 3.1, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the Control Panel window, choose the System icon.

<P><LI>In "User Environment Variables for &lt;user&gt;" box, enter the following
   environment variables:
<P>
<P><PRE>      TERM = ansi
      TERMCAP = //&lt;drive letter in ALL CAPS&gt;/&lt;dir&gt;/&lt;termcap filename&gt;
      _POSIX_TERM = on
      tmp = //&lt;drive letter in ALL CAPS&gt;/&lt;dir&gt;
      path = &lt;drive letter&gt;:\&lt;vi executable location&gt;
</PRE>
</OL></UL><LI>The TERM variable needs to have a value that matches an entry in the
   TERMCAP file; by default, this entry is named ansi. Make sure the word
   "ansi" is lowercase.

<LI>The TERMCAP variable contains the full path of the TERMCAP file
   including the TERMCAP filename itself. You must use the POSIX style
   naming convention and the drive letter must be in uppercase. You can
   customize the entry in the TERMCAP file according to your usual command
   prompt window size; if you usually use a window that's not 80 columns-by-
   25 lines, change the CO entry to match the number of columns, and change
   the LI entry to match the number of lines. For example, if you usually
   use a 100 column-by-60 line window, the CO entry would be "co#100" and
   the LI entry would be "li#60". There is an example of a TERMCAP file
   later in this document.

<LI>The POSIX_TERM variable must be set to "on" to use the terminal
   emulation portion of the POSIX server.

<LI>The TMP variable must be set to any valid directory, you must use the
   POSIX style naming convention, and the drive letter must be in
   uppercase. The drive letter itself must be located on an NTFS volume. If
   /tmp is not located on an NTFS volume, then you will only be able to
   launch vi from any local root directory.

<LI>The PATH variable needs to include the directory where the vi executable
   resides, to be able to run it from anywhere. You should use the standard
   MS-DOS naming convention.
<P>
</UL><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
If the directory of the TERMCAP file and the location of "tmp" is on drive
D, AND VI.EXE is located in the D:\reskit\posix directory, then the
environment variable entries should be the following:
<P>
<PRE>   TERM = ansi
   TERMCAP = //D/etc/termcap       (Drive letter must be in ALL
   CAPS)
   _POSIX_TERM = on
   tmp = //D/etc                   (Drive letter must be in ALL
   CAPS)
   path = d:\reskit\posix

</PRE></OL>You can verify that these environment variables are set correctly by typing
"set" from the command prompt. However, do not initialize these environment
variables using "set" because they will disappear when you exit the VDM.
Always use the System applet.
<P>
The TERMCAP file must have the following entries to work under Windows NT:
<P>
li|ansi|psx_ansi|:\
<PRE>             :co#80:li#25:\
             :am:pt:ms:bw:\
             :cl=\E[2J:cm=\E[%i%d;%dH:ce=\E[K:cd=\E[J:\
             :sf=\E[S:sr=\E[T:\
              :ho=\E[H:sc=\E[s:rc=\E[u:up=\E[A:d=^J:nd=\E[C:le=^H:\
              :ku=\E[A:kd=\E[V:kr=\E[C:kl=\E[D:kb=^H:\
              :so=\E[7m:se=\E[m:mr=\E[7m:me=\E[0m:\

</PRE>WARNING: Having the "tmp" variable set to a POSIX-style path causes
problems with other applications that look for "tmp" because they expect
the "tmp" variable to be set to a standard MS-DOS style naming convention,
and may fail when it is not.
