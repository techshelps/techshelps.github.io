The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If a virus is present in the master boot record, the following message
appears after selecting the partition to install Windows NT to during
setup:
<P>
<PRE>   The hard disk containing the partition or free space you chose is
   not accessible to your computer's startup program. Setup cannot
   install Windows NT on this hard disk.

</PRE>On x86-based computers, this message may indicate a problem with the
computer's CMOS hard disk type settings. Consult your computer or hard
disk controller documentation for more information.
<P>
NOTE: This message does not necessarily indicate an error condition. The
hard disks typically accessible to a computer's startup program are those
whose installation in your computer were anticipated by the computer
manufacturer.
<P>
For example, disks attached to a SCSI adapter not installed by your
computer manufacturer, or to a secondary hard disk controller, are
typically not visible to the startup program unless special software is
added to your computer. Contact your computer or hard disk controller
manufacturer for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The message is referencing a translation/configuration problem between
Windows NT and the hard disk you are trying to install Windows NT to. A
computer virus that is part of the Master Boot Record of a hard drive can
also cause the same message to appear during setup. (If the problem is
caused by the NYB virus, you can remove the virus with the lastest version
of McAfee's antivirus program.)
<P>
If the message appears during setup right after you have selected the
partition to install Windows NT to you need to do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Use a well known virus application such as McAfee SCAN.EXE and verify
   the entire drive. Not all Master Boot Record viruses can be eliminated
   with a FDISK /MBR. Drives without a partition still have Master Boot
   Records and have to be checked also.

<P><LI>Ensure that the BIOS drive type for IDE and EIDE drives are correct. You
   may need to change the CMOS drive type from AUTO to the manufacture
   specifications.

<P><LI>Verify adapter and drive options for SCSI devices to include termination
   and SCSI cables.

<P><LI>If all hardware has been verified for configuration you may need to run
   a hardware diagnostics on the system to verify that the hard disk
   controller and hard drive are functioning properly.
<P></OL>
