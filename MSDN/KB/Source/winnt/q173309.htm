The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Windows NT 4.0, the system stops and displays the following
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Stop: c0000135 {Unable to Locate DLL}
   The dynamic link library FILE_NAME could not be found in the specified
   path Default Load Path."

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error can occur for either of the following reasons:

<UL><LI>File_name.dll is missing from the %SystemRoot%\system32 directory.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If File_Name.dll exists, the software hive may be corrupted and,
   therefore, cannot load.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The method for checking whether File_name.dll exists varies, depending on
the file system in use.
<P>
For NTFS file systems, install a parallel copy of Windows NT into an unused
directory, and then verify that File_name.dll exists in the
%SystemRoot%\System32 directory.
<P>
For FAT File Systems, an MS-DOS installation disk can be used.
<P>
If the file exists, it is possible that the registry software hive has been
corrupted. Check the integrity of the software hive by using the following
procedure:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help
topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before
you edit it.
<P>
NOTE: In every case tested in which the software hive could not be loaded,
the File_name was Winsrv.dll.

<OL><P><LI>From a parallel installation of Windows NT, click Start, and then click
   Run.

<P><LI>In the dialog box, type Regedt32.

<P><LI>On the toolbar for Registry Editor, click Window, and then click the
   window with the following name:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE ON LOCAL MACHINE
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key in the left pane of the window.

<P><LI>On the menu bar, click Registry, and then click Load Hive.

<P><LI>Browse to %SystemRoot%\System32\config, where %SystemRoot% is the
   correct installation of Windows NT that you want to check.

<P><LI>Click the file software. In Windows NT 4.0, this will be the software
   file with the generic Windows icon next to it, not the file with the
   Notepad icon. In Windows 3.51, the file will appear as System.

<P><LI>The system will prompt for a key-name to use in loading the hive. You
   can type whatever you prefer in the dialogue box; Work would be a good
   choice.

<P><LI>The hive is corrupted if you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Registry Editor could not load the key.  The file is not a valid
      Registry file.
</PRE><P>
</OL>After you have determined the problem, there are several ways to resolve
it. The software hive can be restored by making a parallel installation
from backup files. It can also be restored from the latest emergency repair
disk (ERD), using the procedure outlined below.
<P>
NOTE: Windows NT 4.0 requires the Setupdd.sys file to be copied to disk 2
of the Windows NT Setup disks to perform this repair without a CD-ROM. This
file can be found in Service Pack 2 or later. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

               Attached

</PRE><P><LI>Start the system with the Windows NT Setup disks.

<P><LI>At the first screen, press R for repair.

<P><LI>Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to Inspect Registry Files, and
   then press ENTER to select that option. Next, move the cursor to
   Continue (Perform Selected Tasks) and press ENTER.

<P><LI>Let Windows NT perform the mass storage detection. When prompted, select
   S to specify additional drivers if your computer requires OEM drivers.

<P><LI>When prompted to do so, insert the emergency repair disk that was
   originally created for this computer, or press ESC to let Windows NT
   search for repair information for version 3.51 or version 4.0.

<P><LI>Setup will then ask which registry files should be replaced. Using the
   arrow keys, move the cursor to Software (Software Information) and press
   ENTER. Next, move the cursor to Continue (Perform Selected Tasks) and
   press ENTER.

<P><LI>When finished, restart your computer when Setup prompts you to do so.
