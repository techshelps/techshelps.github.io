The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article addresses effects to system enhancements, third-party
software, and unexpected results after you upgrade your system with a
Microsoft U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>System Enhancements</h3>
 
<P>
The upgrade to a Service Pack should have no effect on post-installation
enhancements of Windows NT services, such as FTP Server. No special
considerations are required for Microsoft-supplied optional features for
Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h3>Third-party Software</h3>
 
<P>
On the contrary, special considerations are required for third-party
software that replaces or adds files with the same name as Windows NT
system files.
<P>
The only known instance of this is vendor-provided Hardware Abstraction
Layers (HALs). When you have a special HAL from an original equipment
manufacturer (OEM), you need to reinstall that HAL after you run the
Service Pack Update program. UPDATE.EXE reads the SETUP.LOG file and if it
sees that the system used HALSP.DLL, for example, when it was originally
set up, it will copy that file from the Service Pack over the top of the
HAL.DLL resident on the hard disk. In this situation, install the Service
Pack and copy the HAL supplied by the third party back onto the hard disk
before you shut down and restart your computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Unexpected Results</h3>
 
<P>
As with any modification of system software, proper care should be taken in
preparing for unexpected problems. For Windows NT, this includes having the
following before you make any modifications:

<UL><LI>A tape backup of the machine's data.
<LI>A backup of the disk configuration.
<LI>A backup of the Registry.
<P>
</UL>If a serious problem arises after you install a Service Pack, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Use the Emergency Recovery Disk. This returns Windows NT to the original
   condition ("as installed" format).

<P><LI>Restore the Registry.

<P><LI>If necessary, restore the disk configuration.

<P><LI>If appropriate, reinstall the Service Pack and any additional software.
<P>
</OL>This can be done in situations where the problem is not believed to be
inherent to the Service Pack itself. An example of this kind of situation
would be neglecting to reinstall third-party software after you install the
Service Pack and before system shutdown. Another example would be a power
failure when you are installing a Service Pack.
