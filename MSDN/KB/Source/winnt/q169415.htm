<P>
NOTE: Routing and Remote Access Service running on Windows NT Server
version 4.0 is also referred to as the Windows NT router.
<P>
Setup Issues
General Setup Issues
<PRE> * You must install Routing and Remote Access Service on a computer
   running Windows NT Server version 4.0 with Service Pack 3 installed.

 * You cannot run the Remote Winsock client on a Windows NT router. If you
   have the Remote Winsock client installed on the computer, delete it
   before installing Routing and Remote Access Service.

 * If Setup detects that you have any of the following services, you will
   be prompted to delete them:
   *  Remote Access Service (RAS)
   *  RIP for IP
   *  RIP for IPX
   *  SAP Agent
   *  BOOTP/DHCP Relay Agent

</PRE>These services and the Registry settings for the services are now part of
the Routing and Remote Access Service.
<P>
For more setup information, see Chapter 2, "Installing and Configuring
Routing and Remote Access Service," in the Administrator's Guide.
<P>
Install Network Adapters Before Routing and Remote Access Service
It is recommended that you install any network adapters or services (such
as ISDN or PPTP) before installing Routing and Remote Access Service.
<P>
If you install a network adapter or service after you have installed
Routing and Remote Access Service, and if the adapter or service requires
you to reinstall Service Pack 3, you must then update Routing and Remote
Access Service.
<P>
<P><h3>To update Routing and Remote Access Service</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Network in Control Panel, on the Services tab, select Routing and
   Remote Access Service, and then click Update.

<P><LI>When prompted, type the path of the directory that contains the Routing
   and Remote Access Service program files.
<P>
</OL>Setup Options
During the Routing and Remote Access Service Setup, you can install Remote
access service (RAS), LAN routing, Demand-dial routing, or all three. If
you install LAN routing, whatever network protocols are currently
installed on your computer are automatically enabled for routing. However,
if you install demand-dial routing, you can choose the protocols. To do
this, click Network in the Routing and Remote Access Setup dialog box.
<P>
NOTE: If you cancel Setup after the dialog box in which you choose Remote
Access Service (RAS), LAN routing, or Demand-dial routing, then the
Oemnsvra.inf file in your Systemroot\System32 directory is the version
from Routing and Remote Access Service. To install Windows NT version 4.0
RAS or a previous version of Routing and Remote Access Service, you must
manually copy the file Oemnsvra.inf from your Windows NT version 4.0 CD or
your Service Pack CD to your Systemroot\System32 directory.
<P>
For more information on the Setup options, see Chapter 2, "Installing and
Configuring Routing and Remote Access Service," in the Administrator's
Guide.
<P>
Routing and Remote Access Service Packet Filtering and Windows NT 4.0
TCP/IP Security
<P>
You can resolve the following two issues by using Network in Control
Panel.
On the Protocols tab, select TCP/IP Protocol and click Properties.
<P>
<PRE> * On the IP Address tab, click Advanced. The PPTP filtering option in the
   Advanced IP Addressing dialog box has no effect after Routing and
   Remote Access Service is installed. However, if you configured TCP/IP
   filters before you installed Routing and Remote Access Service, those
   filters will migrate to Routing and RAS Admin.

 * Click the Routing tab. If the Enable IP Forwarding check box is
   selected, do not clear it after you install Routing and Remote Access
   Service. If you do clear it, your router will not function properly.

</PRE></OL>NOTE: This applies only if you have enabled IP routing before you
installed Routing and Remote Access Service. If you have never enabled IP
routing, you do not need to select this check box to enable the routing
functionality of Routing and Remote Access Service.
<P>
Routing and Remote Access Service Packet Filtering and Microsoft Proxy
Server
<P>
If you install Microsoft Proxy Server and Routing and Remote Access
Service on the same computer, it is important to use caution when you
configure filtering in both Microsoft Proxy Server and Routing and Remote
Access Service. Packet filtering in Routing and Remote Access Service can
impair the functionality of Microsoft Proxy Server in two ways:
<P>
<PRE> * Routing and Remote Access Service input filtering can prevent inbound
   intranet client requests from being processed on the intranet
   interface. It can also prevent inbound response data from Internet Web
   servers from being processed on the Internet interface.

 * Routing and Remote Access Service output filtering can prevent
   translated Web requests by Microsoft Proxy Server from being
   transmitted to Internet Web sites on the Internet interface. It can
   also prevent translated Internet Web server responses by Microsoft
   Proxy Server from being transmitted to intranet clients on the intranet
   interface.

</PRE>If you want to use Microsoft Proxy Server on the same computer as Routing
and Remote Access Service, you must configure local host filters in
Routing and RAS Admin. For information about how to configure local host
filters, see Chapter 3, "Administering Routing and Remote Access Service,"
of the Administrator's Guide, or see the online Help file in Routing and
RAS Admin.
<P>
Using DHCP Versus Static Pool Addresses on a RAS Server
<P>
If a RAS server is connected to a LAN with multiple network numbers on the
same physical wire, do not use DHCP to assign addresses to clients.
Instead, use a static address pool to assign the addresses. If you use
DHCP to assign addresses to RAS clients, some clients might not be able to
reach other computers on the LAN that are on the same subnet.
<P>
For example, say a RAS Server uses DHCP to assign addresses. For its LAN
interface, it gets the address a.a.a.11 from the range a.a.a.0, with a
mask of 255.255.255.0. The RAS Server also uses the DHCP server to assign
addresses for its RAS address pool. It gets the addresses b.b.b.10,
b.b.b.11, and b.b.b.12 from the range b.b.b.0, with a mask of
255.255.255.0.
<P>
Because the DHCP server gives addresses from both ranges to computers on
the LAN, other computers on the LAN will have addresses on the b.b.b.0
subnet.
<P>
Although the RAS Server uses only a few addresses from the b.b.b.0 subnet,
it adds a route for the whole subnet through the RAS Server interface.
Therefore, RAS dial-in clients cannot reach other computers on the b.b.b.0
subnet because of this bad route.
<P>
To work around this, either use a static pool on the RAS Server, or add a
static route to the RAS Server for all logical subnets on your local
segment.
<P>
Demand-Dial Interface Issues
General Demand-Dial Interface Issues
<PRE> * When you restore the configuration of a router by using Load
   Configuration from the Server menu, the credentials for the demand-dial
   interfaces are not restored. You must specify them manually for each
   interface.

 * When a Windows NT router connects to another Windows NT router by using
   a demand-dial interface, both routers act as PPP clients and obtain an
   IP address for their local demand-dial interface from the remote
   router. There can be IP addresses from different subnets on each end of
   a WAN link. This is not a problem because it is a point-to-point link.
   However, if a routing protocol is used, configure the interface to use
   multicast, not broadcast.

 * You can use the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) that shipped
   with Windows NT version 4.0, or you can use the PPTP drivers that are
   in the directory in which you installed the Routing and Remote Access
   files. If you run Multilink PPTP, use these drivers to improve
   performance and stability on heavily used computers, or when connecting
   over congested networks. If you want to use these drivers, copy
   Raspptpe.sys, Raspptpm.sys, and Raspptpu.sys to your
   Systemroot\System32\Drivers directory.

</PRE>Demand-Dial Interface is Unreachable
When a demand-dial interface reconnects after the WAN link has been
disconnected, an error might appear in the Event Log. Also, in Routing and
RAS Admin, the Connection State for the interface is temporarily marked
unreachable.
<P>
The event logged in Event Viewer is the result of a timing condition and
is incorrectly marked as an error. It should be marked as information
because the router recovers and successfully reconnects the interface in
these cases.
<P>
The event logged in Event Viewer is the following:
<P>
Event ID: 20111
Source: Router
Event Description: A Demand Dial connection to the remote interface
&lt;interface name&gt; on port &lt;port name&gt; was successfully initiated but failed
to complete successfully because of the following error: The interface is
already connected.
<P>
Connect to Third-Party Routers
You can enable a Windows NT router to request an IP address when you
connect to third-party routers through demand-dial interfaces.
<P>
<P><h3>To enable a Windows NT router to request an IP address</h3>
 
1. In Network in Control Panel, on the Services tab, select Routing and
<PRE>   Remote Access.

</PRE><P><LI>Click Properties, and then click Network.

<P><LI>In the Network Configuration dialog box, click the TCP/IP Configure
   button.

<P><LI>Select the Allow remote clients to request a predetermined IP address
   check box.
<P>
</OL>Removing an Interface when the Router is stopped In Routing and RAS Admin,
if you remove a demand-dial interface when the router is stopped, the
interface is removed from the Registry, but is left behind in the router
phonebook file. If you want to add the interface again and you continue to
receive the error "interface already exists," you must delete the entry
from the router phonebook file.
<P>
To delete an entry from the router phonebook

<OL><P><LI>In your Systemroot\System32\Ras directory, open the Router.pbk file in
   a text editor.

<P><LI>Delete the entry for the demand-dial interface.

<P><LI>Save and close the file.
<P>
</OL>IPX Issues
General IPX Issues
<P>
<PRE> * If your Windows NT router is a primary domain controller (PDC) that
   uses only the IPX protocol, then clients that dial in to that Windows
   NT router will not be validated on the router's domain. To avoid this
   problem, add the IP protocol on the router, or move the Windows NT
   router to a different computer.

 * If your Windows NT router is using File and Print Services for NetWare
   (FPNW), the router cannot connect to any FPNW shares on the router.
   This does not affect any other aspect of FPNW. Clients can still
   connect and use FPNW on the router, and the router can connect and use
   FPNW on other NetWare servers.

 * If the IPX protocol does not route with Eicon Technology WAN Services
   for Windows NT V3R4, then use the Eicon Configuration tool
   (Ecadmin.exe) supplied by Eicon. Run Ecadmin.exe, select router, select
   connections, and then select the X25 entry on the right. Select
   properties, and ensure that 00 appears in the User Data field. Repeat
   this procedure on all the systems that use Eicon WAN Services for IPX
   to route.

</PRE></OL>Disable IPX Routing
By default, if you have installed the IPX transport protocol, your router
is an IPX router. If you want to disable IPX routing on your computer, you
must disable IPX on all RIP for IPX and SAP for IPX interfaces in Routing
and RAS Admin.
<P>
Do not delete the NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible Transport protocol or disable
the bindings for IPX in Network in Control Panel. If you do, Routing and
RAS Admin will not start.
<P>
To disable IPX routing

<OL><P><LI>In Routing and RAS Admin, under IPX Routing, select RIP for IPX or SAP
   for IPX.

<P><LI>Right-click an interface, and then select Configure Interface.

<P><LI>In the Interface Configuration dialog box, clear the Enable RIP or SAP
   on this Interface check box.
<P>
</OL>You must complete this procedure for every IPX interface in Routing and
RAS Admin.
<P>
Disable RIP or SAP Protocol
There is no way to individually remove RIP for IPX or SAP for IPX routing
protocols. However, you can disable them by using the Routing and RAS
Admin tool in the Start/Programs/Administrative Tools (Common) folder.
<P>
To disable IPX RIP or IPX SAP on an interface

<OL><P><LI>In Routing and RAS Admin, under IPX Routing, select RIP for IPX or SAP
   for IPX.

<P><LI>Right-click an interface, and then select Configure Interface.

<P><LI>In the Interface Configuration dialog box, clear the Enable RIP or SAP
   on this Interface check box.
<P>
</OL>Auto-Static Route Updates Fail for IPX Interfaces
In Routing and RAS Admin, if you do an auto-static update over an IPX
demand-dial interface and the static table remains empty for the interface
you are updating, check the network number of the interface.
<P>
To check the network number
<P>
* Under IPX Routing, click Summary, and then select the demand-dial
<PRE>  interface. Check the number that is displayed in the Network Number
  column.

</PRE></OL>If the network number is anything other than zero, you must replace the
Nwlnkipx.sys file on your computer.
<P>
To do this, copy the Nwlnkipx.sys file from the directory in which you
installed the Routing and Remote Access Service files on your computer to
your Systemroot\System32\Drivers directory, and then restart your
computer.
<P>
For more details about this problem, see the Ipxfix.txt file that is
located in the \Support directory in the directory in which you installed
the Routing and Remote Access Service files on your computer.
<P>
OSPF Issues
General OSPF Issues
<P>
* In Routing and RAS Admin, in the global OSPF Configuration dialog box,
<PRE>  do not configure the router identification number to be 0.0.0.0.

</PRE>* When you configure an OSPF router, do not duplicate router
<PRE>  identification numbers. The router identification number must uniquely
  identify a router throughout the OSPF autonomous system.

</PRE>Change One of Multiple IP Addresses on an OSPF Interface If OSPF is
configured on an interface that has multiple IP addresses and you want to
change one of the IP addresses, complete the following steps:
<P>
*  Remove the interface from OSPF.
*  Change the IP address.
*  Restart your computer.
*  Add the interface to OSPF.
<P>
To remove the interface from OSPF

<OL><P><LI>In Routing and RAS Admin, under IP Routing, select OSPF by Bay
   Networks.

<P><LI>Right-click the interface and then click Remove interface.
<P>
</OL>To change the IP address

<OL><P><LI>In Network in Control Panel, configure the TCP/IP Protocol.

<P><LI>In the IP Address tab, click Advanced.

<P><LI>In the Adapter box, select an adapter.

<P><LI>In IP Addresses, click Edit.

<P><LI>Type the new IP address and click OK.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
</OL>To add the interface back to OSPF

<OL><P><LI>In Routing and RAS Admin, under IP Routing, right-click OSPF by Bay
   Networks, and then click Add interface.

<P><LI>Select the interface to add and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the General tab, select each IP address in the IP Address box, and
   then click the Enable OSPF on this interface check box.

<P><LI>When you are finished configuring the interface, click OK.
<P>
</OL>OSPF and the Default Gateway
It is possible to unintentionally advertise a default route within an
autonomous system (AS).
<P>
If you configure the TCP/IP protocol by using Network in Control Panel and
enable a default gateway, adding this same default gateway address on an
OSPF interface might cause the unintentional advertisement.
<P>
The problem occurs when the router is defined as an autonomous system
boundary router (ASBR) and you add the interface to OSPF, then enable OSPF
to run on the interface. OSPF, as a result, picks all of the non-OSPF
routes that are configured on the interface and advertises them to the AS.
This means that the router also picks the default route (0.0.0.0) and
advertises it to the other OSPF routers. If the router that is the default
gateway also runs OSPF, it will learn about the default route and thus
learn that the next hop for the default route is itself. This causes the
default gateway to drop all the packets destined to the default route
since the next hop is its own interface. This can cause major network
problems.
<P>
Note: This can also occur when you add a static route to the address
0.0.0.0.
<P>
If you still need the default route locally, you can prevent OSPF from
picking it up and advertising it by adding a route filter that processes
all the external routes except the default route.
<P>
To add the route filter

<OL><P><LI>In Routing and RAS Admin, right-click OSPF by Bay Networks and then
   click Configure OSPF.

<P><LI>On the External Routing tab, click Routes.

<P><LI>In the OSPF External Route Filters dialog box, click Process all routes
   except those listed.

<P><LI>Enter a route with the address 0.0.0.0 and the mask 0.0.0.0, and then
   click Add.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The External Routing tab is visible only after you configure the
router as an AS boundary router on the General tab.
<P>
Use OSPF and RIP Together
If two routers use OSPF, do not use any other routing protocols between
them. This is because you do not want the routers to exchange intra-area
or inter-area routes through another routing protocol that were originally
learned by OSPF.
<P>
To work around this problem, configure only one router to listen to RIP.
Configure the other router not to listen at all.
<P>
To do this, you can use either of these methods:
* Set a peer filter to drop RIP packets that come from the remote OSPF
<PRE>  router.

</PRE></OL>* Ignore incoming RIP packets that come over an interface.
<P>
To set a peer filter for RIP

<OL><P><LI>In Routing and RAS Admin, right-click RIP for IP, and then click
   Configure RIP.

<P><LI>On the Security tab, select the Discard all announcements from the
   routers listed check box.

<P><LI>Enter the address of the computer to ignore, and click Add.
<P>
</OL>To ignore RIP packets on an interface

<OL><P><LI>In Routing and RAS Admin, select RIP for IP.

<P><LI>Right-click the interface, and then click Configure interface.

<P><LI>On the General tab, in the Protocol for incoming packets box, select
   Ignore incoming packets.
<P>
</OL>Miscellaneous Issues
<P>
<PRE> * If the router process (Routing and Remote Access Service) is not
   responding, restart your computer.

 * If you save the configuration of a remote computer by using Save
   Configuration from the Server menu, the directory and drive into which
   you are saving must exist on both the local and the remote computers.
   For example, if you are saving a configuration to the C:\Save directory
   on the computer on which you are running Routing and RAS Admin, then
   make sure the C:\Save directory exists on the remote computer you are
   administering.

 * To monitor a Windows NT router you must use the Routing and RAS Admin
   tool in the Start/Programs/Administrative Tools (Common) folder. To
   administer a Windows NT version 4.0 or earlier RAS Server, you must use
   the Remote Access Admin tool (Rasadmin.exe).

 * Routing and Remote Access Service supports only 40-bit encryption. If
   you upgrade a RAS server that uses 128-bit encryption to Routing and
   Remote Access Service, you will have only 40-bit demand-dial and RAS
   encryption.

 * You cannot remove a routing protocol by using the Routing and RAS Admin
   tool (Mpradmin.exe). However, you can remove a routing protocol by
   using the routemon command. You can add a routing protocol by using the
   Routing and RAS Admin tool or the routemon command. To delete a routing
   protocol by using routemon, at the command prompt, type:
   ROUTEMON IP DELETE PROTOCOL PROTO= { RIP | OSPF | BOOTP }

   * The following are limits for Routing and Remote Access Service:
   *  16 LAN interfaces
   *  48 demand-dial interfaces
   *  256 RAS clients

</PRE></OL>You must purchase a client access license for every remote access
connection/port that you configure. For more information, see your license
agreement.
