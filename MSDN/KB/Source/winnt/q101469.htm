<P><h3> </h3>
 
The following information applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
There are three methods to add a computer to a Windows NT domain:

<UL><LI>Through the Server Manager
<LI>By installing the Windows NT workstation or Windows NT Advanced
   Server
<LI>By using the Networks option in the Windows NT Control Panel
<P>
</UL><h3>Using the Server Manager to Add a Computer to a Domain</h3>
 
<P>
Perform the following six steps to use the Server Manager to add a
computer to a domain:

<OL><P><LI>The Administrator must log onto an account with Administrator
   privileges on any Advanced Server in the domain.

<P><LI>Run the Server Manager in the Administrative Tools group.

<P><LI>From the Computer menu, choose Add To Domain.

<P><LI>In the Add Computer to Domain dialog box, choose either the Server
   option to add an Advanced Server to the domain or the Workstation
   option to add a workstation to the domain.

<P><LI>Enter the name of the computer in the Computer Name edit control
   and choose Add. Then choose Close.

<P><LI>Log onto the newly-added computer and run the Control Panel. Choose
   Networks and make sure that the list of domains includes the newly
   specified domain.
<P>
</OL><h3>Adding a Computer to a Domain During Installation</h3>
 
<P>
Perform the following three steps to add a computer to a domain while
installing Windows NT:

<OL><P><LI>The Windows NT Setup includes a Network Configuration section to
   configure the workstation to join a domain or join a workgroup.

<P><LI>If the workstation joins a domain, enter the domain name. If an
   account for the workstation does not already exist in the Server
   Manager, select an administrator name and password to create a new
   account for the computer in the domain.

<P><LI>After entering the domain name, administrator name, and
   administrator password (if required), Windows NT responds with the
   message "Welcome to the &lt;domain_name&gt; domain" where &lt;domain_name&gt;
   is the specified domain. This message indicates that the
   workstation was successfully added to the domain.
<P>
</OL>Perform the following three steps to add a computer to a domain while
installing Windows NT Advanced Server:

<OL><P><LI>The Windows NT Advanced Server Setup includes a Network
   Configuration section to configure the Advanced Server as the
   Primary Domain Controller for a new domain or as a Backup Domain
   Controller for an existing domain. A Backup Domain Controller
   stores a copy of the domain user database.

<P><LI>To join a domain as a Backup Domain Controller, enter the domain
   name. If an account for the workstation does not already exist in
   the Server Manager, select an administrator name and password to
   create a new account for the computer in the domain.

<P><LI>After entering the domain name, administrator name, and
   administrator password (if required), Windows NT responds with the
   message "Welcome to the &lt;domain_name&gt; domain" where &lt;domain_name&gt;
   is the specified domain. This message indicates that the
   workstation was successfully added to the domain.
<P>
</OL><h3>Adding a Computer to a Domain with the Control Panel</h3>
 
<P>
Perform the following four steps to use the Control Panel to add a
workstation to a domain:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Control Panel and select the Network icon.

<P><LI>The Network dialog box lists the workgroup or domain to which the
   workstation belongs. Choose Change to add a new domain.

<P><LI>If an account for the workstation does not already exist in the
   Server Manager, select an administrator name and password to create
   a new account for the computer in the domain.

<P><LI>After entering the domain name, administrator name, and
   administrator password (if required), Windows NT responds with the
   message "Welcome to the &lt;domain_name&gt; domain" where &lt;domain_name&gt;
   is the specified domain. This message indicates that the
   workstation was successfully added to the domain.
