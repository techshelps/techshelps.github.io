The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Restore Database option in WINS Manager to restore the
WINS database from one WINS server to a different WINS server, you may
notice that you receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   WINS Manager
   Restore succesfully completed.

   NOTE: 'Successfully' is misspelled in the actual error message.

</PRE>However, you notice when you view the database in WINS Manager it is a new
database and is not a restored copy of the original.
<P>
The location of the WINS directory path is contained in the WINS
backup set. If you copy Wins.mdb from the backup set location to the new
WINS folder, when you start the WINS service you may receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   WINS could not come up due to missing/corrupt database.
   Restore the database using WINS Manager or winscl.exe and then restart.
   If WINS still does not come up, start with a fresh copy of the database.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You are attempting to restore the WINS database to a location that is
different from where the original database was stored.
<P>
For example, if the original database was stored in the following location:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Winnt\System32\Wins

</PRE>then the new location has to be the exact same path.
<P>
NOTE: This occurs even when using the new Winsrpc.dll mentioned in the
following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q162563.htm">Q162563</A></B>
   TITLE     : WINS Restore Fails on Windows NT Server 4.0

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To successfully transfer the WINS files from one WINS server to another,
you will need to use one of the following workarounds:

<UL><LI>The new Windows NT Server will need to be installed to the same path
   (drive letter and folder name) as the original WINS server.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Instead of using the backup and restore functions of the WINS Manager,
   manually copy the contents of the WINS folder from the original WINS
   server to the new WINS server.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
