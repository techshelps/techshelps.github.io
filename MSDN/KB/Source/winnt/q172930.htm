The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Files contained in Macintosh volumes contain streams (special data content)
that include data fork information. Files that do not contain stream
information appear to Macintosh clients as text-only files. The reported
problem occurs after copying a file from one directory to another. The copy
operation could be performed from the computer running Windows NT Server or
by a Macintosh client; it made no difference. After the copy operation, the
target file stream was lost and the file appeared to Macintosh clients as a
text-only file.
<P>
This copy problem occurs on PDC or BDC servers, but not on a member server.
It also occurs when the Domain User Rights for "Bypass Traverse Checking"
(the default is Everyone) has been modified so no users are granted this
right for the Domain.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
NTFS was making a check that precluded the copying of the streams in the
case where "Bypass Traverse Checking" was removed from user rights.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The issue has been resolved in the latest version of the Ntfs.sys driver.
Obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
<P>
<PRE>   -or-

</PRE>Restore the Domain User Right: Bypass Traverse Checking to Everyone.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
