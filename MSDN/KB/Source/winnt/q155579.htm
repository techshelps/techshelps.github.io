The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After a clean installation of Windows NT, you may be able to log on, but
the shell may not start.
<P>
NOTE: Typically it will be a user, not the administrator, who sees this
behavior.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Security was inherited from the root, which does not allow a user access to
%systemroot% because security has not been set on %systemroot%.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Using File Manager's or Windows NT Explorer's security dialogue box, set
security on the %systemroot% directory such that "Everyone" has RX
permissions, and clear the "Replace Permissions on Existing Files" check
box. Also, clear the "Replace permissions on Subdirectories" check box.
<P>
Alternately, "Everyone" can be replaced with the users you want to be able
to log on.
<P>
If the shell does not start for any account, you must use one of the
following methods:

<UL><LI>Reformat the drive and reinstall.

<LI>Boot from another installation of Windows NT that does not exhibit
   this behavior and change the security on the volume as indicated
   for %systemroot%.

<LI>Install onto another volume that does not have such security.
<P>
</UL>It will not be possible to perform a clean (fresh or non-upgrading)
install again on the volume and avoid this problem unless security on the
volume is changed as well.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem does not occur after an upgrade from a previous version or if
the volume installed upon is formatted during the install process.
<P>
Typically, this problem is seen when the permissions on the volume on which
the system was installed grant access to Administrators and System, but
"Everyone" has been removed.
<P>
