<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to create a Performance Monitor log so that
engineers can use it to troubleshoot performance problems on a
computer running Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Creating the Performance Monitor log:

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, select Log.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, select Add To Log

<P><LI>In the Add To Log dialog box you will see Computer and Objects. In
   Computer, specify the name of the local computer or a remote computer
   you want to get a log of. In Objects, add the counters that you want
   Performance Monitor to log. These counters will change depending on the
   problem that you are troubleshooting.

<P><LI>Highlight the objects that you wish to monitor and select Add.

<P><LI>Under Options select Log.

<P><LI>Under File Name, name the log.

<P><LI>At the bottom of this window you will see Update Time. It is important
   to set this update time. If you are going to be running the Performance
   Monitor log for an extended period of time, you will want to set this
   update time to an interval much higher than 15 seconds or the log will
   be very large. If you are only going to be running the log for an hour
   then 15 seconds will be fine.

<P><LI>Now you are ready to start the log. Press the Start Log button
   located in the same window as the above. This will start the log and
   this icon will change to a Stop Log icon once the log is started.
<P>
</OL>When you are ready to stop monitoring the selected objects and examine
your log file perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Under Options select Log and Stop Log.

<P><LI>Under the Options menu select "Data from" and "Log File".  Now
<P><PRE>    select the radio button beside the perfmon.log field and locate
    your log file.  Choosing File and Open cannot open a log file.
</PRE>
<P><LI>After opening the log file, add the objects and counters that were
<P><PRE>    monitored.  Do this for each view needed otherwise the log file's
    data will not be available.
</PRE><P>
</OL>If you are troubleshooting a performance issue or an issue that looks like
a memory leak, the objects that Performance Monitor should log include but
are not limited to:
<P>
<PRE>   Memory
   Paging File
   Process
   Processor
   Server
   System

</PRE></OL>NOTE:

<UL><LI>If the computer is restarted or goes down while the log is going, you
   can start a new log, or if you specify the name of an existing log file
   the new data is appended to the end of the log file. It is important to
   let the engineer know the log was restarted.

<LI>If there are processes that start after the log was started they will
   not show up in the beginning of the log. You will need to go to Edit
   and select Time Window. There is a sliding scale that you can use to
   view different periods in the log.

<LI>If the user logs off, the performance monitor log will stop. Performance
   logging can be setup as a service but running Performance Monitor remotely
   from another Windows NT system is the easiest way to collect a performance
   log.
