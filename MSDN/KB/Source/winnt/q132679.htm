<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the Local System account and its security
implications, as well as a useful way to run applications in Local System
security context.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Background</h3>
 
<P>
The shell application (typically PROGMAN.EXE) runs under the DOMAIN\USER
security context. Most processes started from the shell process inherit the
same security context.
<P>
When setting up Windows NT services, you choose a security context
for the service to be started under (because these services are typically
not started by a user). To check the security being used by a service:

<OL><P><LI>Run Control Panel and choose Services.

<P><LI>Select a service and choose Startup.
<P>
</OL>The security context of the service is set in the Log On As window pane.
<P>
<P><h3>Services Using The System Account</h3>
 
<P>
Services using the system account start in the system context (without
credentials). In Windows NT 3.5 and later, Windows NT services with no
credentials (no domain name, user name, or password) that attempt to
connect to network resources are denied access (because they have no
credentials and are using a null session). For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q122702.htm">Q122702</A></B>
   TITLE     : Using the System Account as a Service in Windows NT 3.5

</PRE></OL>NOTE: System Account and This Account: Local System use the same account.
<P>
A null session is only established when there are no credentials for a
process to start under (no user name or password). Typically, the only
operating system itself runs as system.
<P>
On the local machine, the operating system is known as:
<P>
<PRE>   Default Owner:   Administrators    local group
   User:            System            pseudo group - local group scope
   Groups:          Administrators    local group
                    Everyone          pseudo group - local group scope

</PRE>When this context is used to access the network, a null session is used.
This produces the following context on remote machines:
<P>
<PRE>   Default Owner:   Everyone
   User:            Everyone
   Groups:          AnonymousLogon    pseudo group - local group scope
                    Network           pseudo group - local group scope

</PRE>Only three identifiers can provide the null session access (Everyone,
AnonymousLogon, and Network). The local system context and null session
context have only the identifier Everyone in common. To configure Windows
NT so that a service can access objects on its own machine directly, as
well as over the network, use the Everyone identifier.
<P>
The default owners of these two contexts (as well as their default DACLs)
are different. Any files you created in these contexts will be owned by
Administrators. Any files you create through a null session will be owned
by Everyone.
<P>
