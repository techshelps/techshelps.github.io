The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you change your password, you receive an error indicating that
it does not meet the domain password requirements; however, the stated
requirements have been met.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Normally, this message is correct; however, when strong passwords are
required there may be restrictions in effect that will exclude many
passwords.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix referenced below, or wait for
the next service pack.
<P>
NOTE: The hotfix will need to be applied to all clients. The client is
responsible for mapping a text message to the error code returned from the
server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The old password error message was:
<P>
<PRE>   Your new password does not meet the minimum length or password history
   requirements of the domain.

</PRE>The new messages displayed after you apply the fix are:

<UL><LI>Your new password does not meet the minimum length or password history
   requirements of the domain. Also, your site may require passwords that
   must be a combination of upper case, lower case, numbers, and
   non-alphanumeric characters.

<LI>Your password must be at least &lt;#&gt; characters long. Your new password
   cannot be the same as any of your previous &lt;#&gt; passwords. Also, your
   site may require passwords that must be a combination of upper case,
   lower case, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
