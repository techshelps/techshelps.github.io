The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In some customer situations, it may be necessary to change some Registry
values when using TCP/IP across a Wide Area Network (WAN) that has slow
links.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Optimizing Windows NT to Run Over Slow WAN Links with TCP/IP</h3>
 
<P>
All of the TCP/IP parameters are registry values located under one of two
different subkeys of:
<P>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services:
<P>
<PRE>   Tcpip\Parameters

   -or-

   &lt;Adapter Name&gt;\Parameters\Tcpip

   where &lt;Adapter Name&gt; refers to the subkey for a network adapter to which
   TCP/IP is bound such as Lance01.

</PRE>Values under the latter key(s) are specific to each adapter. You must
reboot the computer for a change in any of these parameters to take
effect.
<P>
NOTE: The Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit documentation was not updated
properly from version 3.1. It lists a number of invalid TCP/IP registry
parameters. The parameters listed in this Knowledge Base article should be
used instead. The Windows NT 3.5 TCP/IP stack was completely rewritten, so
many of the old parameters are no longer valid. The Windows NT
3.51 Resource Kit should include the necessary corrections or refer to the
whitepaper available at the following location:
<P>
<PRE>   File Name: Tcpipimp2.doc
   Location : <B><A HREF="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-docs/papers/">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-docs/papers/</A></B>
   Title    : "Microsoft Windows NT 3.5/3.51/4.0: TCP/IP Implementation
               Details TCP/IP Protocol Stack and Services, Version 2.0"

</PRE><h3>Step-by-Step Procedure</h3>
 
<P>
CAUTION: The Windows NT 3.5 TCP/IP implementation is largely self tuning.
Adjusting registry parameters may adversely affect system performance.

<OL><P><LI>Increase TcpMaxConnectRetransmissions
<P>
</OL>TcpMaxConnectRetransmissions
Key: Tcpip\Parameters
Value Type: REG_DWORD - Number
Valid Range: 0 - 0xFFFFFFFF
Default: 3
<P>
Description: This parameter determines the number of times TCP will
retransmit a connect request (SYN) before aborting the attempt. The
retransmission timeout is doubled with each successive retransmission in a
given connect attempt. The initial timeout value is three seconds.
<P>
Notice that the timeout value doubles after each transmission retry.
Increasing the default value may allow a client to connect over a slow
WAN.
The value should only be changed in very small increments because behavior
is governed by the value below. Too large a value could ensure that a
connection attempt will never time out.
<P>
TcpMaxDataRetransmissions
Key: Tcpip\Parameters
Value Type: REG_DWORD - Number
Valid Range: 0 - 0xFFFFFFFF
Default: 5
<P>
Description: This parameter controls the number of times TCP will
retransmit an individual data segment (not connection request segments)
before aborting the connection. The retransmission timeout is doubled with
each successive retransmission on a connection. It is reset when responses
resume. The base timeout value is dynamically determined by the measured
round-trip time on the connection.

<OL><P><LI>Reduce TcpWindowSize
<P>
</OL>TcpWindowSize
Key: Tcpip\Parameters
Value Type: REG_DWORD - Number of bytes
Valid Range: 0 - 0xFFFF
Default: The smaller of 0xFFFF
<P>
OR (The larger of four times the maximum TCP data size on the network
<PRE>   OR
   8192 rounded up to an even multiple of the network TCP data size.)
</PRE></OL>The default is 8760 for Ethernet.
<P>
Description: This parameter determines the maximum TCP receive window size
offered by the system. The receive window specifies the number of bytes a
sender may transmit without receiving an acknowledgment. In general,
larger
receive windows will improve performance over high delay, high bandwidth
networks. For greatest efficiency, the receive window should be an even
multiple of the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS).
<P>
Reducing the TCP Window size effectively causes an acknowledgment to be
sent to the sender for data received sooner. This will lower the
possibility that the sender will time out while waiting for an
acknowledgment. However it will also increase the amount of network
traffic
and cause slower throughput.

<OL><P><LI>Reduce the ReplicationGovernor
<P>
<PRE>ReplicationGovernor     REG_DWORD

</PRE></OL>Range:  0 to 100 percent
Default:  100
<P>
Defines both the size of the data transferred on each call to the Primary
Domain Controller (PDC) and the frequency of those calls. For instance,
setting ReplicationGovernor to 50% will use a 64K buffer rather than a
128K buffer and will only have a replication call outstanding on the net a
maximum of 50% of the time.
<P>
Do not set the ReplicationGovernor too low, or replication may never
complete. A value of 0 will cause Netlogon to never replicate. The SAM/LSA
database will be allowed to get completely out of sync.
<P>
BDCs can be configured for the variances of WAN types. ReplicationGovernor
allows the administrator to control the partial synchronization
parameters. This parameter must be set individually on each BDC.
<P>
NOTE: It is also possible to configure different replication rates at
different times of the day using a script file with the AT command (for
example, net stop netlogon, regini scriptfile, net start netlogon). The
script file contains the path to the RegistrationGovernor parameter and
the new Registry entries. Regini.exe is part of the Windows NT Resource
Kit.
<P>
This entry should only be changed if replication is being done across a
slow WAN. Replication across a slow WAN link is network intensive and not
recommended.

<OL><P><LI>Remove WINS and use lmhosts files instead for name resolution across
   link. This will cause NetBIOS name resolution to occur on the local
   machine or the local segment so that a connection to a WINS server
   across the WAN is not attempted.
