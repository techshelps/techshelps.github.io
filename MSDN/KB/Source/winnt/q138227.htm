<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT computers show increased paging activity to the swap file. This
generally is observable by a slowdown in computer performance. Computers
exhibiting intense paging activity can appear hung, the mouse can skip as
you move it, and the disks with paging file(s) appear constantly active.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When performance monitor connects to a computer across a network, Winlogon
on the remote computer is responsible for passing performance statistics
back to the performance monitor client. Network Monitor Agent allocates
approximately 1.5 Megabytes of memory that it does not free when the
performance monitor client disconnects. This non-deallocated memory
consumes an additional 1.5 Megabytes of page file memory with each
connection by a performance monitor client. This occurs even if the service
is installed but not running.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has modified the Network Monitor Agent to free the memory it
allocates.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5.
This problem has been corrected in Windows NT version 3.51. A version 3.5
fix to this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested
and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not
recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information on the availability of this fix.
