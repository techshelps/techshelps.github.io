<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a Windows NT sockets application attempts to resolve a name using
Gethostbyname(), your client computer may experience several time-outs if
the Domain Name Service (DNS) server is unavailable. These time-outs may
last several minutes as your client fails DNS resolution and then tries
to use Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) or broadcast methods to
successfully resolve the name.
<P>
NOTE: These time-outs occur repeatedly during the operation of Microsoft
Exchange Server, because the client continues to attempt name resolution
during various operations.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT clients are not properly caching "short names" that have been
resolved successfully by the DNS Server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, use one of the methods below:

</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Your Windows NT Domain Name Resolver (DNR) should be caching the DNS name
for the time-to-live (TTL) provided by the DNS server. This caching assists
with the time-outs by allowing the client to use cached names that have
been resolved successfully. Repeated queries and the resulting time-outs
will not occur until the name's TTL assigned by the DNS server has expired.
<P>
If a Windows NT sockets application attempts to resolve a name, the caching
is only done for fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). "Short names," or
names such as Host instead of host.domain.com, are not cached.
<P>
Winsock, the files that provide Windows Sockets to applications, has been
modified so that short names are cached. This is done on a per-process
basis. For example, when a Microsoft Exchange client is initialized and
name resolution is performed through Winsock to the DNS server, two queries
are observed. One query is performed in the Exchange process; the other
query is performed on behalf of the MAPI spooler process. Subsequent
Gethostbyname() requests made by a process are serviced from the cache.
The entry will remain in cache for the TTL provided in the name query
response.
