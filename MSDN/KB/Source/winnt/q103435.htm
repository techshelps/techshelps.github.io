The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The following are advantages of the small computer system interface
(SCSI):

<OL><P><LI>Unlike other interfaces, when you interface with different device
   types using SCSI, the interfacing is done through the same cable.
   In a non-SCSI environment, devices such as a proprietary tape
   controller, disk controller, and so on, must be used to connect
   their respective devices to the system bus.

<P><LI>SCSI peripheral devices of the same type have similar
   characteristics (this makes it easy to replace old devices with new
   ones).

<P><LI>SCSI peripheral devices are intelligent and independent: a
   controller is built onto each SCSI device. This allows the computer
   to do other work.

<P><LI>SCSI I/O is independent of the system bus. This allows peripheral
   devices to work with different computer types, which preserves a
   company's hardware investment.

<P><LI>SCSI is fast (10 megabytes (MB)/second on 8 bit bus, 20 MB/second
   on 16 bit bus).

<P><LI>Multi-threaded operating systems, such as Windows NT, can take full
   advantage of the multi-tasking capabilities of the SCSI bus.
<P>
</OL>For example, when a Windows NT thread requests to read a logical block
on SCSI disk 1, and at the same time, a second thread requests to write
some data to SCSI disk 2, the following may occur:

<UL><LI>The SCSI host adapter will process the first request made by
   Windows NT executive by arbitrating the SCSI bus and making a
   connection to disk 1.

<LI>After the connection is made, disk 1 will disconnect and give up
   the bus (bus free) so that other requests can be made by the host.

<LI>The first thread will stop executing and will wait while the slow
   I/O device completes a data transfer.

<LI>As the seek is carried out on disk 1, the second thread request
   will be processed in the same manner as the first, because Windows NT
   can issue a "context switch" to allow for a thread of execution
   while another is still being completed.

<LI>Because the bus is free at this time, the host (initiator) will be
   able to make a connection with disk 2. Disk 2 will then disconnect
   and perform a write of some data to a logical location on the disk.
   At the same time, disk 1 may still be seeking the block to read.
   The two devices are therefore performing a task ( read, write)
   simultaneously.
