Sound Impressions is a 16-bit Windows-based application that provides
multimedia functionality (Wave, MIDI, CD Audio) through a graphical
interface that emulates a home stereo rack system. The application is
often bundled with sound cards and multimedia upgrade kits, such as
the MediaVision Pro Studio 16 sound card. When you perform the Setup
for this application under Windows NT, you may receive error messages
or warnings because the application expects a Windows 3.1 environment.
<P>
During the installation for Sound Impressions, a 'System Status
Report' is generated by the Setup application. If you install Sound
Impressions under Windows NT, then a report similar to the following
may be produced:
<P>
<PRE>   System Status Report:

   Setup has compiled a list of system
   configuration items for your review.

   Items that may not be in accordance
   with Sound Impressions requirements
   or merit a cautionary note are preceded
   by a series of stars (****).

   Double-click on any item for more
   information. To proceed with Setup,
   click Continue or press ESC.

   To quit Setup, choose close from the
   Control Box (upper left corner) or
   press ALT, SPACEBAR, C or ALT+F4.

   ****MIDI driver not detected
   ****Multimedia Timer not detected
   ****Permanent Swap File not found
   ****Arial is not on your fonts list
   ****32-bit Disk Access is off"

</PRE>Subsequent to receiving this status screen, the Setup application
should continue without error. Sound Impressions components (Wave,
MIDI, and CD Audio) should work without errors in Windows NT. However,
a second CD-ROM drive may not be recognized by Sound Impressions.
These warnings displayed by the Setup application are caused by the
expectation that the environment is Windows 3.1.
<P>
Sound Impressions is manufactured by Dennis James McMahon and
distributed by Media Vision, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
