<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
This articles discusses the differences between the guest account on a
Windows NT Advanced Server running Services for Macintosh, and the
Guest logon option that Macintosh users may choose when attempting to
log on to a Windows NT Advanced Server running Services for Macintosh.
<P>
The guest account on a Windows NT Advanced Server is different from
the Guest logon option for Macintosh. When a Macintosh user attempts
to log on to a Windows NT Advanced Server running Services for
Macintosh, and that user selects the Guest option, that user is not
logged on to the Windows NT Advanced Server as the guest account.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a Macintosh user selects the Guest option during logon, the
MacFile Control Panel reports the following when displaying the Users
connected:
<P>
<PRE>Connected Users      Computers
&lt;Guest&gt;              &lt;Unknown&gt;

</PRE>In this case, the Macintosh is not logged with any user account the
Windows NT Advanced Server has.
<P>
When a Macintosh user selects the Registered User option and uses the
user name "Guest," the MacFile Control Panel reports the following
when displaying the Users connected:
<P>
<PRE>Connected Users      Computers
Guest                &lt;Unknown&gt;

</PRE>In this case, the Macintosh is logged on to the Windows NT Advanced
Server as that computer's guest, and therefore has the permissions of
the guest account.
<P>
The difference, as displayed, is the missing greater-than and
less-than ("&gt;" and "&lt;") signs. The difference, effectually, is that
the Macintosh Guest is not the same as the guest account; they are
similar in name only.
<P>
To disable a Macintosh user from logging on to the Windows NT Advanced
Server as a Guest (as opposed to as the guest account), the Allow
Guests To Logon check box in the Security box of the MacFile Attributes
dialog box must be clear (that is, not checked).
<P>
To disable a Macintosh user from logging on to the Windows NT Advanced
Server as the guest account, the guest account itself must be
disabled. This makes it so no user, from any computer, can use the
guest account.
<P>
Another option to deny the guest account access from a Macintosh is to
limit the guest account to log on only from certain named computers.
This can be done in the Logon From box, which can be accessed by
choosing User Properties from the User Manager.
<P>
The permissions of the guest account is set by the User Manager. The
permissions for the guest logon option is dependent upon the Everyone
setting under Permissions from the MacFile menu in File Manager. Note
that the Macintosh permission structure differs from the Windows NT
permission structure.
