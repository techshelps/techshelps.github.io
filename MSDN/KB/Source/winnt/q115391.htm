<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following is information contained in INTEROP.TXT file that ships with
Windows NT Advanced Server upgrade tools.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
********************INTEROP.TXT*********************
<P>
This document includes notes on Windows NT/LAN Manager interoperation.

<OL><P><LI> Administering a Mixed Domain
</OL> 
<P>
In a Windows NT Advanced Server domain that contains LAN Manager servers
and clients, user account modifications occur at the domain controller and
are subsequently replicated to other servers in the domain. Windows NT
Advanced Servers can administer Windows NT servers and clients, as well as
LAN Manager servers. LAN Manager servers can administer LAN Manager servers
and clients, and Windows NT Advanced Servers and clients to a limited
degree. LAN Manager administration limitations result primarily from the
larger feature set available under Windows NT Advanced Server. It is highly
recommended that Windows NT Advanced Server tools be used to manage
domains.
<P>
Most aspects of mixed domain user and share administration, including
adding, deleting, and changing users and shares, work from either platform.
The following adminstration features are not supported, in most cases
because of feature differences:
<P>
Administration of a Windows NT Advanced Server from the LAN Manager Net
Admin menu:
<P>
a) The Users on a Domain dialog (View menu) does not display an entry for
<PRE>   the Windows NT domain controller.
</PRE></OL>b) The Server Options dialog (Config menu) does not display existing alert
<PRE>   names or allow the addition of new alert names.
</PRE>c) Assignment of Admin privileges is not allowed.
d) Cloning a member of the Administrators group is not allowed.
e) Changing the role of the server is not permitted.
f) Listing users logged onto the Windows NT Advanced Server is not
<PRE>   possible.

</PRE>Administration of a LAN Manager Server from a Windows NT Advanced Server:
<P>
a) Forcibly logging out users is not possible because Windows NT does not
<PRE>   support lock-out account settings.

</PRE>b) Neither LAN Manager nor Windows NT Advanced Server support remote
<PRE>   administration of LAN Manager replication servers.

</PRE><P><LI> Password Case Sensitivity
</OL> 
<P>
Password validation in a Windows NT network is case- sensitive as long as
the computer you are logged on to and the computer whose resource you are
trying to access are both Windows NT computers; the case of the password
entered and the password stored in the Windows NT user database must match.
However, if a logon procedure takes place on a non-Windows NT computer (a
Windows for Workgroups computer, for example) or the share being accessed
is on a non-Windows NT server (even if the server is in a Windows NT
domain), password validation becomes case-insensitive. There is one
exception to these rules and one error that results from mismatched case in
passwords.
<P>
The exception is that if you change your password from a non-Windows NT
computer (using the Windows NT NET PASSWORD command), Windows NT stores
your new password as a case-insensitive password and permits all subsequent
logons to be password case-insensitive. Even if another user logs on from a
Windows NT computer, no password case checking is performed.
<P>
An error can be generated if you mismatch the case of your password after
you've already logged onto a Windows NT domain. For example, if you
establish a network session with a Windows NT computer by typing the
following two lines:
<P>
<PRE>   net use x: \\winntcomputer\data /u:domain\user PASSWORD
   net use y: \\winntcomputer\apps /u:domain\user password

</PRE></OL>The following error message is displayed: "System error 1219 has occurred.
The credentials supplied conflict with an existing set of credentials."
<P>
To avoid this error message, make sure you always use the same case when
attempting to connect to shared resources.

<OL><P><LI> Cross Domain and Guest Access
</OL> 
<P>
This section discusses cross-domain and guest access on a network
containing LAN Manager and Windows NT Advanced Servers.
<P>
Consider this example: Your Windows NT Advanced Server is the domain
controller for DomainA, and you have problems seeing or using printers from
LAN Manager DomainB. This could be a very simple problem: You are
connecting to a printer on a non-Windows NT computer, so you must have the
correct printer driver set up on your own workstation. Often, however, it
is a permissions/account problem.
<P>
Possibility 1: There may already be an account with the same name on the
other domain or workstation, but one that uses a different password.
<P>
Possibility 2: You are logged on as DomainA\eric, and have no account on
DomainB. Unless DomainA is a trusted domain for DomainB you have to rely on
guest rights or secure an account DomainB\eric with the same password you
have on your DomainA account. This is the same the way you must do things
now with LAN Manager.
<P>
Use the Administrator account to get access that is denied on other
computers, even if you could have secured guest access.
<P>
Possibility 1--Password Problems:
<P>
<PRE>   Why would the same account with different passwords cause access to be
   denied? The DomainB server receives a request: "Hi, I'm Eric from
   DomainA, my password is q," and responds: "You can't be Eric, that's not
   his password here--Access Denied." If the request comes from an account
   that does not exist on the DomainB server, it responds: "Well, I don't
   know you Miles, but I'll give you guest access" (if the server has a
   guest account enabled).

   Windows NT and OS/2 LAN Manager react the same way to Possibility 1.
   There are some differences, however, when trusted domains are involved.

</PRE></OL>Possibility 2--Trusted Domains:
<P>
<PRE>   The DomainB controller may not recognize the request "I'm Klaas from
   DomainA, my password is q." If DomainA is a trusted domain, however, the
   DomainB server checks the password with the DomainA controller, rather
   than simply deny access. If the DomainA controller says the password is
   correct for the account, the Windows NT server checks the account's
   access privileges to the resource in question and grants the same
   privileges allowed in DomainA.

   MS-DOS or OS/2 clients send the Windows NT server only their username
   and password because they do not support the extended Server Message
   Block (SMB) protocol; Windows NT clients identify their domain as well,
   which the server checks against the list of trusted domains. If a domain
   match exists, the server grants the requester the same privileges
   allowed in its own domain. If the account or domain is unknown, the
   server compares the requester's password against the guest account
   password (if that account is enabled) and grants guest privileges if a
   match exists.

</PRE><P><LI> File Replication
</OL> 
<P>
Both Windows NT and LAN Manager use replication to maintain identical
copies of specified files and directories on different computers. Changes
made to files on one computer are automatically replicated to other
computers configured to receive the changes. In a mixed Windows NT Advanced
Server domain, designate a Windows NT Advanced Server(s) to be the export
server(s). The import server(s) can be other Windows NT Advanced Servers,
Windows NT workstations, or LAN Manager version 2.x servers.
<P>
The following rules also apply:
<P>
a) A Windows NT Advanced Server can be an import and an export file
<PRE>   replication server.

</PRE></OL>b) A LAN Manager server can function as an import server to both Windows NT
<PRE>   workstations and to Windows NT Advanced Servers.

</PRE>c) A Windows NT workstation can function as only an import server. A
<PRE>   Windows NT Advanced Server can replicate files across domain trust
   relationships by establishing the equivalent Replication accounts and
   passwords in each domain.

</PRE>d) When a Windows NT Advanced Server replicates files from NTFS to FAT, it
<PRE>   replicates only 8.3 filenames.

</PRE>e) Windows NT can support any import and export paths. However, maintaining
<PRE>   the default paths, C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\REPL\IMPORT and
   C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\REPL\EXPORT, is recommended.

</PRE>f) The Windows NT message "The account DOMAIN\REPL has been granted the Log
<PRE>   On As A Service right and added to the Replicator local group.",
   indicates that the specified account has been added to the Backup
   Operators and Domain Users groups by default in addition to the
   Replicator group.

</PRE>g) You can replicate directories or files from a Windows NT NTFS volume to
<PRE>   an OS/2 (with LAN Manager 2.x) FAT volume if the filenames adhere to FAT
   file system naming conventions. The same is true for OS/2 as long as the
   filenames adhere to OS/2 HPFS style naming conventions.

</PRE>h) Directories or files can be replicated from a Windows NT Advanced Server
<PRE>   NTFS volume to an MS OS/2 LAN Manager 2.x HPFS volume; however, the
   names of the directories or files must adhere to the HPFS conventions,
   as follows:

    - Names can be up to 254 characters.
    - Paths and filenames can together be up to 259
      characters long.
    - Blank spaces and periods can occur anywhere in
      the file or directory name.
    - These characters can be used in naming HPFS
      files: [ ] , + = ;
    - These characters are not currently allowed: &lt; &gt; :
      " / \ | * ? &amp;

</PRE>If you experience problems during file or directory replication, use the
following steps to troubleshoot.
<P>
1) Note what operating system is running on the import computer (Windows
<PRE>   NT, Windows NT Advanced Server, OS/2, UNIX).

</PRE>2) Is there anything interesting in the error log in the import computer?
<PRE>   The applications log has entries for the Replicator service and often
   contains useful information. Look at the logs on both the import and
   export computers.

</PRE>3) What file systems are installed in the partitions pointed to by the
<PRE>   import and export paths?

</PRE>4) How many import computers exhibit incorrect behavior?
<P>
5) What time zones are the import and export computers running in?
<P>
6) Make sure the import computer has Backup Operator permissions. If these
<PRE>   permissions are not set up, errors 5, 1300, and 1307 will appear in the
   event log.

</PRE>7) Are the import and export computers in the same domain? If so, are the
<PRE>   password and username the same in both domains? Do the domains trust
   each other?

</PRE>8) Are alerts being received by administrative accounts? (Has the Alerter
<PRE>   service been started?)

</PRE>9) Are there any extended attributes in the files or directories being
<PRE>   replicated?

</PRE>10) If the source directory is on an NTFS partition, are there any
<PRE>   alternate data streams in the files or directories being replicated?

</PRE>11) If the source or destination directories are on an NTFS partition, look
<PRE>   at the permissions on the import and export trees with File Manager.
   Does the Replicator local group have at least CHANGE privileges to these
   directories?

</PRE>12) Is it possible that an account has a file open (on import or export)
<PRE>   all the time? This would appear as a sharing violation in the event log
   (error 32).

</PRE>13) Is there a REPL$ share on the export computer? (The share is created as
<PRE>   a side effect of the Directory Replicating dialog box on the export
   computer. This dialog box also sets an ACL for the REPL$ share. Using
   the NET command or any other means to create the REPL$ share is likely
   to cause problems.)

</PRE>14) If you run the NET START command on the export and import computers, do
<PRE>   both computers show "Directory Replicator" (or equivalent) in the list?

</PRE>15) If you are exporting or importing from an NTFS directory, does either
<PRE>   tree have filenames that differ only in case? Which file gets replicated
   is not predictable. It is possible that the export computer will choose
   one file and the import computer will choose another. This results in
   the replication being out of sync.

</PRE>16) Some versions of the OS/2 importer leave the archive bit set on all
<PRE>   files imported, whether or not it was set on the export side. This too
   could result in continuous copying. One work around is to set the
   archive bit on all files on the export computer. (Windows NT to Windows
   NT replication correctly clones the archive bit.)

</PRE>17) Some LAN Manager 2.1a import computers do not set their status file to
<PRE>   OK.RP$. The cause is currently unknown, but there are a few side
   effects. Files will not be recopied each pass, but a file comparison
   will occur. Except for the status file state, the files are correctly
   replicated. This behavior does not occur on LAN Manager 2.2 importers.

</PRE>18) Some versions of LAN Manager allow hard disk files with reserved names,
<PRE>   such as LPT1 or COM1. This can cause problems with HCOPY.EXE, XCOPY.EXE,
   and Replication and should be avoided. These files can be deleted from a
   DOS client's commandline using the DEL command. The Windows NT
   replicator currently lets these filenames exist.

</PRE>19) OS/2 LAN Manager only allows one set of credentials to be in use at a
<PRE>   time. (The credentials consist of the user name and password.) If
   someone is interactively logged on to one user identification (ID) and
   the replicator is trying to use a different user ID, then replication
   cannot occur until the interactive user logs off. On the other hand, if
   the interactive user and the replicator user have the same user ID, then
   replication is possible, depending on the value of the TryUser value in
   the LANMAN.INI file.

</PRE>20) LAN Manager importers are generally designed with a limit of 1000 files
<PRE>   per directory. You should be aware that the "." and ".." directory
   entries use two of those 1000 entries. Also, some versions may have an
   off-by-one error that causes repeated file copies with exactly 1000
   entries. This gives a practical limit of 997 files for those importers.
   The Windows NT importer does not have these limitations.

</PRE>21) Are there some files being replicated from an HPFS partition (written
by OS/2) to a Windows NT server? Do these files have extended attributes
(EAs)? If so, OS/2 may have written the EAs in discontiguous parts of the
disk; Windows NT does not support this. The directory replicator includes
the EA sizes in its checksums, and they may be wrong in this case. The
replication may stay out of sync permanently. You can use Windows NT to
rewrite the same EA values to a single contiguous area, if you know the
original EA values. Note that accessing an HPFS volume over the network
while OS/2 is directly reading or writing the volume will work correctly.
