<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If Windows NT detects a duplicate media access control address on the
network, you will receive one of the following messages in the Windows NT
System Event Log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID   : 4198
   Source     : TCP/IP
   Description: The system detected an address conflict for IP address
                129.0.0.1 with the system having hardware address
                02:A0:8C:DE:00:FD the local interface is being disabled.

   -or-

   Event ID   : 4199
   Source     : TCP/IP
   Description: The system detected an address conflict for IP address
                0.0.0.0 with the system having network hardware address
                xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx. Network operations on this system may
                be disrupted as a result.

</PRE>NOTE: IP addresses and addresses will be different than the sample.
<P>
All network connectivity over TCP/IP to this computer will cease until the
conflict is resolved and the system is restarted.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Media access control addresses are preassigned and permanently burned into
the network interface card (NIC). These addresses under normal
circumstances are always unique, however, rare errors made during the
manufacturing process can cause duplicate media access control addresses to
be used and cause this problem. Another source of duplicate media access
control addresses can occur if you are assigning locally administered media
access control addresses (LAA), in which case you are overriding the burned-
in address in favor of the locally assigned media access control address.
Some Windows NT drivers allow for LAA media access control addresses,
usually Token Ring adapter drivers.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Troubleshoot</h3>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot this problem, you have to determine which other computer on
the network is using the same media access control address. Several tools
that ship with the Microsoft TCP/IP stack can be used to locate the
duplicate addressed computer.
<P>
To isolate the duplicate media access control address, perform the
following steps:
<P>
From a working TPC/IP based client:

<OL><P><LI>Ping the TCP/IP address found in the event log entry from a command
   prompt by typing the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      PING  129.0.0.1
</PRE><P>
   You should get replies back similar to these from the duplicate
   addressed computer:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Pinging 129.0.0.1 with 32 bytes of data:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Reply from 129.0.0.1: bytes=32 time=10ms ttl=128
      Reply from 129.0.0.1: bytes=32 time=&lt;10ms ttl=128
      Reply from 129.0.0.1: bytes=32 time=&lt;10ms ttl=128
      Reply from 129.0.0.1: bytes=32 time=&lt;10ms ttl=128
</PRE>
<P><LI>To verify the computer’s media access control address is the duplicate,
   type the following at a command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARP -a 129.0.0.1
</PRE><P>
   You should get a reply back as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Internet Address  Physical Address
      129.0.0.1 02:A0:8C:DE:00:FD  &lt;-- matches the event log entry
</PRE>
<P><LI>We can now use NBTSTAT to get the NetBIOS (friendly) name of
   the duplicate computer by typing the following at a command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NBTSTAT -A 129.0.0.1
</PRE><P>
   You should get a reply back with the NetBIOS name of the computer.
   Use this NetBIOS name to determine who the owner of the computer
   is so you can locate it on your network.
<P>
<PRE>   NAME             TYPE               STATUS
   -----------------------------------------------
   NTSERVER1           &lt;00&gt;                Unique
   DOMAN-NAME          &lt;00&gt;                GROUP
   NTSERVER1           &lt;03&gt;                Unique

   Media access control address = 02-A0-8C-DE-00-FD

   If you get a message:

      HOST NOT FOUND.

   This would indicate that the duplicate computer is not a NetBIOS
   enabled computer, like a Novell server, Unix server, Router, or perhaps
   a Jet Direct Printer.

</PRE><P><LI>Once you find the duplicate addressed computer, you can either replace
   its network card, or if a locally administered media access control
   address (LAA), change it to be unique on the network.
<P>
</OL>Changing a LAA can be accomplished by performing the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click the Network icon.

<P><LI>While displaying the properties of the installed network adapter,
   change the properties or configuration of the installed Network Adapters
   LAA to use a unique LAA.
