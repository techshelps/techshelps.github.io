You may have trouble connecting to your ISP if your ISP's Point-to-Point
protocol (PPP) server does not support Link Control Protocol (LCP)
extensions. LCP extensions include a Callback option, Time Remaining, and
Identification packets as defined in RFC 1570. Contact your ISP to

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Connect Using a Terminal Window</h3>
 
<P>
Some PPP and SLIP accounts require you to log on using a terminal window,
and then type "PPP" or "slip" (without quotation marks) at a terminal
prompt to start the session. When you log on, you may also need to prefix
your user name with characters such as "P" or "S" or "PPP:" (without
quotation marks). Contact your ISP to determine if you must type "ppp" or
"slip" at a terminal prompt or if your user name requires a special
prefix.
<P>
If your ISP requires additional information other than your user name and
password, you may need to use a terminal window. To open a terminal window
after you connect, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
   Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Click the phone book entry for your ISP in the Phonebook Entry To Dial
   box.

<P><LI>Click More, and then click Edit Entry And Modem Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Script tab, click Pop Up A Terminal Window, and then click
   OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>No Prompt for Username and Password</h3>
 
<P>
If you do not receive a prompt for your user name or password when you
attempt to connect to your ISP, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
   Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Click the phone book entry for your ISP in the Phonebook Entry To Dial
   box.

<P><LI>Click More, and then click Edit Entry And Modem Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Security tab, click Unsave Password, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Disable Your Login Script</h3>
 
<P>
If you run a login script to connect to your ISP, disable it and try to
connect with a pop-up terminal window. If you are able to connect, there
may be a problem with your login script file. You may need to contact your
ISP for assistance in creating a script file to use with Dial-Up
Networking. Windows NT includes several basic script files including:

<UL><LI>Ppp.scp
<LI>Slip.scp
<LI>Cis.scp
<P>
</UL>NOTE: When you use the CompuServe Information Service (CIS) script, you
must use your CIS ID for your user name. For more information about using
these files, view the Script.doc file in the Winnt\System32\Ras\Script
folder. If you have problems creating a script file to automate your log
on, contact your ISP for further assistance.
<P>
If you have a SLIP account, you must use a terminal window or a script
file to connect to your ISP. When you are using a SLIP account, most ISPs
display your IP address for the session in the terminal window. Most ISPs
inform you of your IP address with a message similar to "Your IP address
is &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;" or "SLIP session from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; to
&lt;###.###.###.###&gt;." In this case, the second number is usually your IP
address. You should enter this in the IP Address box. If the address is
the same every time you connect, you can change it in the phone book entry
in TCP/IP settings on the Server tab.
<P>
<P><h3>Verify the Phone Number</h3>
 
<P>
Verify that you are using the correct phone number to connect to your ISP.
If you use MSN, The Microsoft Network, as your ISP, verify that you are
dialing in to an MSN phone number that supports calls for the service type
"Internet and the Microsoft Network."
<P>
<P><h3>Mutual Authentication</h3>
 
<P>
You may have problems logging in to your ISP if your ISP's PPP server is
using mutual authentication. Dial-Up Networking does not support mutual
authentication. Contact your ISP to determine whether your ISP's PPP
server uses mutual authentication.
<P>
<P><h3>PPP Logging</h3>
 
<P>
Enabling the PPP logging file (Ppp.log) may help you troubleshoot other
problems related to connecting to your ISP's PPP server. For information
about how to enable the Ppp.log file, see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q115929.htm">Q115929</A></B>
   TITLE     : Enabling PPP Logging in Windows NT

</PRE></OL>NOTE: If you are using routing and the Remote Access Service Update, the
above Microsoft Knowledge Base article does not apply. For information
about enabling logging in this situation, see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
