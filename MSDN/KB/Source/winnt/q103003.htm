The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The article contains Registry entries for network services, Part 7.
These subgroups are included:

<UL><LI>Redirector (Rdr) Service
<LI>Remote Access Service (RAS)
<P><PRE>     - RAS NetBIOSGateway Subkey
     - RAS AsyncMac Subkey
     - RAS RasHub Subkey
     - RAS RasMan Subkey
</PRE><P>
</UL>For a listing of the contents of network services entries articles
1-8, see "Network Services Entries, Part 1."
<P>
<P><h2>Redirector (Rdr) Service Entries</h2>
 
<P>
The subkey for the Rdr (redirector) service has this Registry path:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rdr\ Parameters

</PRE>For the search buffer sizes defined in the following entries: if the
buffer passed for the search is less than the LowerSearchThreshold
value, the system requests LowerSearchThreshold bytes of data from the
server. If the buffer size is between the value of
LowerSearchThreshold and UpperSearchBufferSize, the system uses the
buffer size. On a slow link (such as a RAS link), if it will take more
than five seconds to retrieve data, the Redirector service uses the
user's requested buffer size.
<P>
<PRE>ConnectTimeout     REG_DWORD    Number of seconds
   Specifies the maximum amount of time the redirector will wait for a
   connect or disconnect to complete. Default: 300 (5 minutes)

LowerSearchBufferSize     REG_DWORD    Number of kilobytes
   Specifies the number of bytes the redirector will use for small
   searches. Default: 16K

LowerSearchThreshold     REG_DWORD    Number of kilobytes
   Specifies the number of bytes below which the redirector will
   request a search of LowerSearchBufferSize. If the search size is
   larger than this (but below the UpperSearchBufferSize), the
   redirector will use the UpperSearchBufferSize. Default: 16K

StackSize     REG_DWORD    Number of kilobytes
   Sets the default IRP stack size for the redirector. Default: 4

UpperSearchBufferSize     REG_DWORD    Number of kilobytes
   Specifies the number of bytes the redirector will use for large
   searches. Default: 32K

UseAsyncWriteBehind     REG_DWORD    0 or 1
   Enables the asynchronous-write-behind variation of the write-behind
   optimization. Default: 1 (true)

UseWriteBehind     REG_DWORD    0 or 1
   Enables the write-behind optimization. Default: 1 (true)

</PRE><h2>Remote Access Service (RAS) Entries</h2>
 
<P>
The RemoteAccess subkey is created in the Registry when you install
RAS on a server, using the Network icon in Control Panel. The default
values in RemoteAccess and its subkeys work well for all Windows NT
operations such as copying files, using network resources, and sending
and receiving electronic mail. However, for some systems, you may want
to adjust individual parameters to suit your particular performance
and security needs.
<P>
Initially, there are no value entries in the Registry for the Remote
Access key or its subkeys until you add them with new settings. (The
only exception is EnableNetbiosGateway, the NetBIOS parameter.)
Unlisted value entries are set to their default values, as described
in this section.
<P>
For information on Remote Access configuration files and other
parameters, see Appendix B, "Configuration Files," in the "Windows NT
Remote Access Service Administrator's Guide."
<P>
See also WanNameQueryRetries in "NBF (NetBEUI) Transport Entries," in
the article "Network Services Entries, Part 4."
<P>
<P><h3>Remote Access Parameters Subkey Entries</h3>
 
<P>
The Parameters subkey for Remote Access has the following Registry
path:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
        \RemoteAccess\Parameters

</PRE>For changes to take effect, you must stop and restart the Remote
Access service. The functions and settings of these value entries are
as follows:
<P>
<PRE>AuthenticateRetries     REG_DWORD     0 to 10
   Sets the maximum number of unsuccessful retries allowed if the
   initial attempt at authentication fails. Default: 2

AuthenticateTime     REG_DWORD     20 to 600 seconds
   Sets the maximum time limit within which a user must be
   successfully authenticated. If the client does not initiate the
   authentication process within this time, the user is disconnected.
   Default: 120 seconds

CallbackTime     REG_DWORD     2 to 12 seconds
   Sets the time interval that the server waits before calling the
   client back when the Callback feature has been set. Each client
   communicates the value of its own callback time when connecting to
   a Remote Access server. If this value is not communicated (that is,
   if the client does not communicate a value for the callback time,
   as with Remote Access 1.0 and 1.1 clients), the value of the
   CallbackTime parameter becomes the default. Default: 2 seconds

EnableAudit     REG_DWORD     0 or 1
   Determines whether Remote Access auditing is turned on or off. If
   this feature is enabled, all audits are recorded in the Security
   event log, which you can view using Event Viewer. Default: 1
   (enabled)

NetbiosGatewayEnabled     REG_DWORD     0 or 1
   CAUTION: Do not change this value in Registry Editor, because
   various network bindings must also be changed. This parameter
   should be changed only by using the RAS Setup program.

   Makes the server function like a NetBIOS gateway, allowing clients
   to access the LAN. If disabled, remote clients can access only the
   resources on the Remote Access server in a point-to-point
   connection; dial-in users cannot see the network or access network
   resources. Default: 1 (enabled)

</PRE><h3>RAS NetBIOSGateway Subkey Entries</h3>
 
<P>
The Registry path for these entries is the following:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
        \RemoteAccess\Parameters\NetbiosGateway

AutoDisconnect     REG_DWORD     0 to 60000 seconds (1000 minutes)
   Sets the time interval after which inactive connections are
   terminated. Inactivity is measured by lack of NetBIOS session data
   transfer, such as copying files, accessing network resources, and
   sending and receiving electronic mail. You may want to set this
   value to 0 seconds if clients are running NetBIOS datagram
   applications. Setting this value to 0 turns off AutoDisconnect.
   Default: 1200 seconds (20 minutes)

DisableMcastFwdWhenSessionTraffic     REG_DWORD     0 or 1
   Allows NetBIOS session traffic (for example, Windows NT
   applications) to have priority over multicast datagram (such as
   server messages). In other words, multicast datagram are
   transferred only when there is no session traffic. Unless you're
   using an application that depends on multicast datagram, leave
   this parameter enabled. Default: 1 (enabled)

EnableBroadcast     REG_DWORD     0 or 1
   Determines whether broadcast datagram are forwarded to remote
   workstations. Broadcast datagram are not often useful and take up
   too much bandwidth on a slow link. Unless you're using an
   application that relies on broadcast datagram, leave this
   parameter disabled. Default: 0 (disabled)

EnableNetBIOSSessionsAuditing    REG_DWORD     0 or 1
   Enable this parameter to record in the event log the establishment
   of NetBIOS sessions between the remote clients and the LAN servers.
   Enable this parameter to track the NetBIOS resources accessed on
   the LAN. Default: 0 (disabled)

MaxBcastDgBuffered     REG_DWORD     16 to 255
   Sets the number of broadcast datagram that the gateway buffers for
   a client. If you're using an application that communicates
   extensively through multicast or broadcast datagram, increase this
   parameter so that the Remote Access server can deliver all
   datagram reliably. Default: 32

MaxDgBufferedPerGroupName     REG_DWORD     1 to 255
   Sets the number of datagram that can be buffered per group name.
   Increasing this value buffers more datagram per group name but
   also takes up more virtual memory. Default: 10

MaxDynMem     REG_DWORD     131072 to  4294967295
   Sets the amount of virtual memory used to buffer NetBIOS session
   data for each remote client. Because the Remote Access server is a
   gateway between the slow line and the LAN, data is stored
   (buffered) in its memory when coming from the fast line (LAN)
   before it is forwarded to the slow line (asynchronous line).

   The Remote Access server minimizes the usage of the system's
   physical memory by locking only a minimal set of pages (about 64K
   per client) and making use of virtual memory (up to MaxDynMem) to
   buffer the rest of the data. So, as long as there is enough space
   on the hard disk to expand PAGEFILE.SYS, you can increase this
   value if needed.

   If you have an application with a LAN (fast) sender and an
   asynchronous (slow) receiver, and if the sender is sending more
   data at a time than the Remote Access server can buffer in
   MaxDynMem, the Remote Access server tries to apply a form of
   NetBIOS level flow control by not submitting NCB.RECEIVE on the
   session until it has enough buffer space to get incoming data. For
   this reason, if you have such an application, you should increase
   your NetBIOS SEND/RECEIVE timeouts so that the fast sender can keep
   pace with the slow receiver. Default: 655350

MaxNames     REG_DWORD     1 to 255
   Sets the number of unique NetBIOS names each client can have, with
   a limit of 255 names for all clients together. Remote clients
   running Windows NT and Windows for Workgroups may need as many as
   seven or eight names each. To accommodate these workstations, set
   the MaxNames value to 8 and reduce the number of ports on the
   Remote Access server. If you have Windows NT or Windows for
   Workgroups clients dialing in to servers running Remote Access
   version 1.1 or earlier, set this parameter to 8 or greater.
   Default: 255

MaxSessions     REG_DWORD     1 to 255
   Sets the maximum number of simultaneous NetBIOS sessions each
   client can have, with a limit of 255 sessions for all clients
   together. If you have multiple clients connecting simultaneously
   with each running 4 or 5 sessions, decrease the value of this
   parameter so that the total number of sessions does not exceed 255.
   Default: 255

MultiCastForwardRate     REG_DWORD    -1 (disabled); 0 to 32,676 seconds
   Governs the multicasting of group name datagram to all remote
   workstations. This parameter filters datagram sent on group names
   by forwarding them at a specified time interval. The value -1
   disables forwarding. The value 0 guarantees delivery of group name
   datagram. The value n forwards datagram every n seconds, when 1 is
   less than or equal to n less than or equal to 32,676. If the
   EnableBroadcast parameter is set to 0, broadcasts are not forwarded
   even if the MultiCastForwardRate parameter is set to a positive
   number (in this case, only multicast datagram are forwarded). The
   line becomes overloaded. If MultiCastForwardRate is set to -1,
   broadcasts are still not forwarded even if EnableBroadcast is set
   to 1. See also EnableBroadcast.

   To save bandwidth for session traffic, filter the datagram.
   However, if you have an application based on multicast datagram,
   set this parameter to 0. This value guarantees delivery of all
   datagram sent on group names from the LAN to the remote client.
   Default: 5

NumRecvQueryIndications     REG_DWORD     1 to 32
   Allows a Remote Access client to initiate multiple network
   connections simultaneously. If a remote client is running a NetBIOS
   application that does multiple NCB.CALL commands simultaneously,
   increase this parameter to improve performance. Default: 3

RcvDgSubmittedPerGroupName     REG_DWORD     1 to 32
   Determines the number of NetBIOS commands of the type Receive
   Datagram that can be submitted simultaneously per group name on the
   LAN stack. Keep this setting as small as possible to minimize the
   amount of memory consumed by system resources. Each datagram
   command received locks about 1.5K of physical memory in the system.
   Default: 3

RemoteListen     REG_DWORD     0 to 2
   Sets the remote NCB_LISTEN capability.

   Value          Meaning
   ----------------------
   0              Disables a client's ability to post
                  NCB_LISTEN for any NetBIOS name. Because
                  every remote listen posted consumes one
                  session, setting this parameter to 0 saves
                  sessions.
   1              Messages. Allows clients to post
                  NCB_LISTEN on Windows NT Advanced Server
                  message aliases only. If a remote client
                  is running the Messenger service, it can
                  then receive messages from LAN users,
                  printers, and the like.
   2              All. Enables NCB_LISTEN for all remote
                  client NetBIOS names, allowing clients
                  to run NetBIOS server applications. This
                  setting allows all clients to function
                  as NetBIOS servers on the network.

   It is best to leave the RemoteListen parameter set to the default,
   1 (messages). Allowing NCB_LISTEN capability on remote clients can
   significantly drain system resources and therefore is not
   recommended.

   If the RemoteListen parameter is set to 2, Remote Access posts an
   NCB_LISTEN on all NetBIOS names of Remote Access clients. Because
   the average Windows NT Advanced Server workstation has about seven
   or eight NetBIOS names assigned to it, the total number of NetBIOS
   names for which an NCB_LISTEN would be posted is 7 or 8 * 64 (the
   maximum number of clients per Remote Access server), which exceeds
   the 255 maximum. Default: 1 (messages)

SizWorkBufs     REG_DWORD     1024 to 65536
   Sets the size of work buffers. The default setting is optimized for
   the server message block (SMB) protocol, the protocol between the
   workstation and the server running on the Windows NT Advanced
   Server system. Default: 4500

</PRE><h3>RAS AsyncMAC Subkey Entries</h3>
 
<P>
The Registry path for these entries is the following:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
   \AsyncMacn\Parameters

</PRE>For changes to take effect, you must restart the computer.
<P>
<PRE>MaxFrameSize     REG_DWORD    576 to 1514
   Determines the maximum frame size. Use smaller frames for noisy
   links. A lower setting sends less data per frame, slowing
   performance. Do not change this parameter for previous versions of
   the Remote Access service. The value is negotiated between the
   server and Windows NT clients. Default: 1514

</PRE><h3>RAS RasHub Subkey Entries</h3>
 
<P>
The Registry path for the RasHub subkey is:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasHub
      \Parameters

</PRE>For changes to take effect, you must restart the computer.
<P>
The subkeys RasHub01 and RasHub02 show, for example, that this
installation of Remote Access is configured for two COM ports. In
configuring ports, you can determine whether clients have access to
the Remote Access server only (point-to-point connection) or to the
network.
<P>
<PRE>NetworkAddress     REG_SZ      " xxxxxx"
   Reassigns the first four bytes of the 6-byte IEEE address. For
   example, for the address "03-1F-2C-81-92-34" only the first four
   bytes are looked at.

   Some applications depend on an IEEE adapter address being
   available. However, because the Remote Access Service uses modems
   (not real Ethernet adapters), it does not have an IEEE Ethernet
   address per se. This parameter lets you manually set an IEEE
   adapter address for Remote Access adapter bindings where
   applications demand it.

</PRE><h3>RAS RasMan Subkey Entries</h3>
 
<P>
The Registry path for the RasMan key is:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan
   \Parameters

Logging     REG_DWORD      0 or 1
   Turns on information tracking for the modem using the DEVICE.LOG
   file. Set this value to 1 if you have modem problems that you
   cannot solve following documented procedures in the Microsoft
   Windows NT Remote Access Administrator's Guide. Logging begins the
   next time you dial in to connect through RAS (you do not need to
   restart your computer for the DEVICE.LOG file to be created).
