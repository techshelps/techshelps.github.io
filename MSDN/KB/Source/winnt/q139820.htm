<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you remove any disks or members of a fault tolerant set from the
computer without first deleting the information about them in Disk
Administrator – or if a member of a fault tolerant set fails, the
following error message appears when you start Disk Administrator:
<P>
<PRE>   Disk Administrator has determined that one or more disks have been
   removed from your computer since Disk Administrator was last run, or
   that one or more disks are off-line.

   Configuration information about the missing disk(s) will be retained.


</PRE>In addition - Event viewer may post the following event messages:
<P>
Event ID: 12
Source: FTDISK
Description: A stripe set or volume set member listed in the configuration
<PRE>             information was missing.


</PRE>Event ID: 14
Source: FTDISK
Description: The FT set containing \Device\MissingMirror1Member0 cannot be
<PRE>             used.


</PRE>**NOTE: Actual device membership message for event ID: 14 may be different.
<P>
This article describes how to move the existing fault-tolerance registry
information to the registry on a new computer where you install the disks
or members of the fault tolerant set. This article also explains how to
eliminate the error message above after moving an entire, fault-tolerant
subsystem to another computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you create fault tolerant volumes in Disk Administrator such as volume
sets, stripe sets, or mirrored drives, this configuration information is
stored in the registry in binary format that contains specific information
such as number of disks attached to the system, disk signature strings,
drive letter assignments, partition information, and fault tolerant
memberships.
<P>
<P><h3>Moving a Disk or Member of a Fault-Tolerant Set</h3>
 
<P>
If you decide to move all the fault-tolerant arrays or drives from one
computer to a different computer, intact with all data, you must save the
configuration information to a floppy disk from Disk Administrator:

<OL><P><LI>Run Disk Administrator.

<P><LI>From the Partition menu, choose Configuration, then choose Save.

<P><LI>Insert a formatted floppy disk in drive A when prompted.

<P><LI>Install the moved hardware on the new computer.

<P><LI>Insert the floppy created in step 3 in the floppy drive of the new
   computer.

<P><LI>Run Disk Administrator on the new computer.

<P><LI>From the Partition menu, choose Configuration, and then choose Restore.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: When the saved configuration information is restored to the new
computer, the saved configuration information replaces the existing drive
configuration information by overwriting the registry key. Because of this,
it is not possible to move a fault tolerant subsystem to another system
that has a fault tolerant subsystem already installed. In addition, if you
separate multiple fault tolerant subsystems by moving them to separate
computers and restoring the configuration information you receive the
message stated above because the restored key contains Rogue entries about
the missing fault tolerant subsystem.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Eliminating the Error Msg after Moving an Entire, Fault-Tolerant Subsystem</h3>
 
<P>
If you move the entire, fault-tolerant subsystem to another computer, and
no other volume sets, stripe sets, or mirrored drives exist on this system
the error message above appears.
<P>
To elimate the error message:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be resolved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Run the Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Delete the \System\DISK key under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree.

<P><LI>Run Disk Administrator to re-create the DISK key with the current
   information.
<P>
</OL>Any reassigned drive or CD-ROM drive letters need to be reassigned again.
In addition, the FTDISK device must be set to "disabled" in Control Panel
devices.
<P>
NOTE: If you only moved portions of a fault tolerant subsystem to another
computer and you want to eliminate the error message, do not delete the
DISK key, instead, please call Microsoft Product Support services for
Assistance using the NT Resource Kit utility called FTEDIT.
