The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
How a Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) server entry responds when a
conflict occurs varies depending on three different instances:

<UL><LI>State of the entries
<LI>Ownership of the entries
<LI>Addresses of the entries
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Conflict Between 2 Replicas</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If Replica1 and Replica2 are Tombstoned (indicated by a cross in the
   status field), Replica1 is replaced.

<LI>If Replica1 is Tombstoned and Replica2 is active, Replica1 is
   replaced.

<LI>If Replica1 is Active and Replica2 is Tombstoned, Replica1 will be
   kept if:
<P>
<P><PRE>     - Replica1 and Replica2 come from different WINS servers.
     - If they have the same owner, Replica2 will be kept.
</PRE>
<LI>If Replica1 and Replica2 are active, Replica2 will be kept.
<P>
</UL>Conflict Between Owned Entry and
<P><h3>Replica with Same or Different IP Address</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If Address1 is Tombstoned or released and Replica1 is Tombstoned,
   Address1 is replaced.

<LI>If Address1 is Tombstoned or released and Replica1 is active,
   Address1 is replaced.

<LI>If Address1 is active and Replica1 is Tombstoned, Address1 is kept.

<LI>If Address1 and Replica1 are active, Replica1 will be kept. Address1
   will be told to release the name, and Replica1 will increment its
   version stamp to cause repropogation.
<P>
</UL><h3>If a Unique Name Conflicts with a Group Name</h3>
 
<P>
The Group entry is kept.
<P>
<P><h3>If There Is a Conflict Between Two Internet Group Names</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If Group1 is Tombstoned or released and Group2 is Tombstoned, Group1
   is replaced.

<LI>If Group1 is Tombstoned or released and Group2 is active, Group1 is
   replaced.

<LI>If Group1 is active and Group2 is Tombstoned, Group1 is kept.

<LI>If Group1 and Group2 are active, A superset of both groups is
   maintained.
<P>
</UL><h3>If a Multihomed Record Conflicts</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If a multihomed replica clashes with a tombstoned or released
   database entry, the entry in the database is replaced with the
   replica.

<LI>If a tombstoned multihomed replica conflicts with an active entry
   with the same owner, the entry is replaced. However, if the active
   entry is owned by a different owner, then it is not replaced.

<LI>If an active multihomed entry conflicts with an active
   unique/multihomed replica in the same database, it is replaced. If
   the owner is different, it is not replaced.
