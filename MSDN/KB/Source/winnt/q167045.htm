<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT supports Disk Mirroring and Disk Duplexing of the operating
system partition. This article is intended to help clarify why the shadow
drive does not always boot and how to ensure it will boot in the case
of a primary disk failure.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft does NOT guarantee the ability to start from a mirrored drive
without the use of a Windows NT Fault tolerant boot disk. This is because
Windows NT mirrors partitions and information contained in the Bios
parameter block in the master boot sector of the partition on the primary
drive may not be valid for the partition we are mirroring to on the shadow
drive. The bios parameter block contains vital information required for
booting and is partition specific.

   TITLE     : Creating a Boot Disk for an NTFS or FAT Partition

</PRE>In many cases, booting from the shadow drive will work, but this is
dependent on the following requirements:

<OL><P><LI>Both the primary drive and shadow drive MUST be identical in make,
   model, and in many cases firmware revision. This is to ensure that the
   drive geometry is identical and is being translated identically.

<P><LI>Both the primary and shadow drive must be attached to identical
   controllers with the same BIOS and Firmware revisions. Both controllers
   must have translation options set identically - either both enabled or
   both disabled.

<P><LI>Both the primary and shadow drive must be identically partitioned for
   the location of the operating system partition and partitions before the
   operating system partition must also be identical. If an EISA partition
   exists on the primary drive, an identical partition must exist on the
   shadow drive.

<P><LI>The shadow drive must contain a primary partition that is marked active
   and contains a valid Boot.ini file along with NTLDR and NTDETECT.COM.

<P><LI>The primary drive must be inaccessible or disconnected while booting
   back into Windows NT using the shadow drive or a STOP 0x1E will occur.

<P><LI>The shadow drive must contain valid boot code in the master boot
   record (MBR)
<P>
</OL>Failing to meet ANY of the above requirements may prevent booting into
Windows NT from the shadow drive.
<P>
<P><h3>Possible Problems and Solutions</h3>
 
<P>
A. The primary and shadow drives are not identical. Geometry or
<PRE>   firmware revision differences cause the drive to be translated
   differently.

   Solution: Ensure drives are identical. To check firmware revision of the
   same manufacturer and model disk drive, perform the following steps

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-
   wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct
   them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that nay problems resulting from the
   use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

   1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and go to the following subkey:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Hardware\Devicemap\Scsi\ScsiPortx\ScsiBusx\
      TargetIdx\LogicalUnitIdx

      where x varies according to device number.

   2. Look at the REG_SZ identifier value to see the model number and
      firmware revision values. For example, if you see

      SEAGATE ST32430N   0510

      then 0510 is the firmware revision value.

</PRE></OL>B. The controller that contains the shadow drive had it's BIOS disabled
<PRE>   and the translation being performed is now different from the original
   Primary drive.

   Solution: Many SCSI Bioses disable translation mode if the bios is
   disabled. This prevents the drives attached to the SCSI controller from
   being translated and will effect the boot process. Ensure BOTH SCSI
   controllers have their BIOS and translation options set the same.


</PRE>C. The primary drive had an EISA partition in front of the system partition
<PRE>   and you mirrored to a drive that did not contain an EISA partition.

   Solution: Prior to mirroring to the shadow drive, make an identically
   sized EISA partition. It may be possible to move the shadow drive to
   another Windows NT computer to modify the MBS “Hidden Sector” value by
   using the Windows NT 4.0 resource kit utility Dskprobe.exe to make it
   bootable.

   For more information, see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q165181.htm">Q165181</A></B>
      TITLE     : EISA Configuration Boot Code Is Replaced on Mirror Drives

</PRE>D. The Primary partition on the shadow drive is not marked active.
<P>
<PRE>   Solution:

      1. Run MS-DOS FDISK utility and make sure you have an active
         partition.

      -OR-

      2. Use Disk Administrator to mark the partition active.

</PRE>E. When you boot from the shadow - you get a STOP 0X0000001E
<P>
<PRE>   Solution:  The primary drive is still accessible - this causes a stop
   0x0000001E while entering kernel mode. Disable the primary drive by
   either unplugging the power or SCSI connector.

   For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q141242.htm">Q141242</A></B>
      TITLE     : STOP Msg: 0x0000001E Testing New Fault Tolerance Boot
                  Disk

</PRE>F. After you make the previously shadowed partition of a mirrored system
<PRE>   partition into the primary partition; when you restart your computer,
   it stops responding. Only the initial system and peripheral BIOS startup
   text is displayed on the monitor.

   Solution: The shadow drive was mirrored to as a raw drive so Intel boot
   Code was never initialized on sector 0. Prior to mirroring, Use disk
   administrator to make and format a primary partition. Then delete the
   new partition to make free space. This procedure Will ensure the Intel
   boot code was placed on sector 0.

   For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q117131.htm">Q117131</A></B>
      TITLE     : Master Boot Record Not Written to Mirrored Shadow
                  Partition.

</PRE><h3>How To Guarantee Booting from the Shadowed Drive</h3>
 
<P>
In case of a primary drive failure, using the fault tolerant boot floppy
disk always enables you to boot to the shadow drive because you are relying
on the floppy disk drive to act as the boot device. This works because the
computer is not relying on the shadow drive's boot partitions BIOS
parameter block in the master boot sector to locate and load the NTLDR and
Boot.ini files. If you then maintained a small bootable FAT partition at
the beginning of the shadow drive to act as the boot partition, it would,
in effect, take the place of the fault tolerant boot floppy (by loading the
NTLDR and boot.ini files and displaying the boot menu). This small FAT
partition can be made prior to establishing the mirror on the shadow drive
and take the place of the EISA partition if one is located on the primary
drive.
<P>
Because the shadow drive must contain enough free space to contain the
operating system partition you are mirroring, you need to plan this
scenario ahead of time and, if necessary, make the same size small FAT
bootable partition on the primary drive prior to installing Windows NT.
This will ensure you can always boot from the primary or shadow drive.

   TITLE     : Windows NT Partitioning Rules During Setup

</PRE>It may be necessary to pre-partition the drive prior to installing Windows
NT in order to get 2 primary partitions created. This can be accomplished
by moving the drive to another computer running Windows NT and use Disk
Administrator to create 2 primary partitions. This is because MS-DOS FDISK
will not allow you to create a second primary partition.
<P>
<P>
If the primary partition fails to boot, you can run MS-DOS FDISK
and mark the small FAT partition as the active partition so you have 100
percent boot backup without the need of a Windows NT boot floppy disk.
<P>
<P>
