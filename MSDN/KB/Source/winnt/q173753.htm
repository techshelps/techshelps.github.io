The information in this article applies to:

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you upgrade your Windows NT dynamic host control protocol (DHCP)
clients to Service Pack 2 or later, and you are using non-Windows NT DHCP
servers, you may begin receiving error messages indicating duplicate IP
addresses on your network, displayed by DHCP clients.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Service Pack 2 includes an update to the DHCP client that allows
the client to send a new packet type to the DHCP server. This new packet,
DHCP DECLINE, lacks the Client ID in the DHCP Options field. Some non-
Windows NT DHCP servers may not process the DECLINE packet, which can
create duplicate IP addresses on the network.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait from the next
Windows NT service pack.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Service Pack 2 includes an update to the DHCP client that
improves the handling of duplicate IP addresses by workstations. Upon
receiving a DHCP lease, it uses address resolution protocol (ARP) to
determine the assigned IP address. If a response is received (indicating
that the address is already in use by another device on the network), it
sends a DHCP decline to the server. A Windows NT DHCP Server then marks the
address as "bad" and does not attempt to assign that IP address to any
other device. The client resends a DHCP DISCOVER packet and starts the
lease process again.
<P>
RFC 2131 contains the following statement about the required use of client
ID in Section 2, page 9:
<P>
<PRE>   If a client uses a 'client identifier' in one message, it
   MUST use that same identifier in all subsequent messages, to
   ensure that all servers correctly identify the client.

</PRE>For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : DHCP: Detecting and Flagging Duplicate IP Addresses

</PRE>This problem will not arise if you accept the media access control address
as the default client ID (CID) and use a Windows NT DHCP Server, because
the Windows NT DHCP server will look elsewhere in the packet for the media
access control address of the client. If you choose to implement custom
CIDs or use a third-party DHCP server, the IP address will not be marked as
a Bad_Address. There will be duplicate IP addresses on the network if the
DHCP server does not have duplicate address detection enabled.
