The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
This article briefly discusses NWLink. It is divided into these parts:

<UL><LI>What is NWLink?
<LI>What Isn't NWLink?
<LI>Implementation of NWLink
<P>
</UL><h3>What is NWLink?</h3>
 
<P>
The goal of NWLink is to supply added value for ISVs and other
accounts who would like to use Windows NT as an application server
with current MS-DOS, Windows, or OS/2 NetWare clients (for
applications such as SQL Server, SNA Server, and RPC supporting SPX
and Novell NetBIOS over IPX). In addition, NWLink supports the Novell
NetBIOS protocol. There are also NetBIOS enhancements (sliding windows
and flow control, for example) to make Windows NT to Windows NT
sessions more efficient (if this is the only Windows NT transport
being used).
<P>
<P><h3>What Isn't NWLink?</h3>
 
<P>
Novell is offering a Windows NT client that can speak to NetWare
servers. NWLink does not provide this functionality; it is just the
transport. It does not support the ability to do remote file and print
I/O (which would require an additional layer above NWLink supporting
NCPs).
<P>
Novell's offering does not allow NetWare clients to use Windows NT as
an application server, nor does it support Novell NetBIOS. At this
time, their client does not support Windows sockets that are
compatible with Novell's NWIPXSPC APIs. Novell plans to add this
support soon.
<P>
<P><h3>Implementation of NWLink</h3>
 
<P>
NWLink is a streams-based transport (similar to TCP/IP and NDIS
compatible) that supports:

<UL><LI>Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI, and Arcnet topologies
<LI>IPX, SPX, Novell NetBIOS, and enhanced Novell NetBIOS protocols
<LI>NetBIOS and Windows Sockets (IPX and SPX) APIs
<LI>MIPS and Intel platforms
<LI>Multiprocessor awareness
<LI>Portability
<P>
</UL>NWLink does not support NCP as Novell's solution does.
