The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to log on to your local area network (LAN), you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to log you on because your account has been locked out, please
   contact your administrator.

</PRE>NOTE: This error may occur even though you have not previously failed any
logon attempts.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
With the Account Lockout feature in Windows NT enabled in User Manager,
unsuccessful attempts to log on to the network through a Remote Access
Service (RAS) connection will trigger the lockout. This prevents you from
logging on to the LAN.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following timestamp:
<P>
<PRE>   09/04/97  06:40 PM                27,408 Raschap.dll (Intel)
   09/04/97  05:58 PM                23,824 Raslock.exe (Intel)
   09/04/97  06:40 PM                29,456 Rasmsg.dll  (Intel)
   09/04/97  06:40 PM                16,656 Raspap.dll  (Intel)
   09/04/97  06:40 PM                18,192 Rasspap.dll (Intel)

-or-

   09/04/97  06:38 PM                45,328 Raschap.dll (Alpha)
   09/04/97  05:56 PM                61,200 Raslock.exe (Alpha)
   09/04/97  06:38 PM                33,040 Rasmsg.dll  (Alpha)
   09/04/97  06:38 PM                27,408 Raspap.dll  (Alpha)
   09/04/97  06:38 PM                30,992 Rasspap.dll (Alpha)

</PRE>NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to Windows NT 4.0 prior to applying
this fix.
<P>
This fix introduces a new feature called Remote Access Account Lockout
Manager (RAALM), which resolves the above problem by separating the two
lockout mechanisms. By making the RAS lockout count lower than the Account
Lockout, failed RAS logon attempts will not affect a user on the LAN from
logging on to the domain. This is done by the RAALM revoking the dial-in
permissions of the user.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help
topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before
you edit it.
<P>
After you have applied the above fixes, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>If your primary user account database is on the RAS Server, skip to Step
   2. If not, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Install the Remote Access Account Lockout Helper service by running
<P><PRE>      Raslock.exe at a command prompt.
</PRE><P>
   b. In Control Panel, open Services, and then select Remote Access
<P><PRE>      Account Lockout Helper, and click Startup.
</PRE><P>
   c. Click Log On As This Account and enter an account and password that
<P><PRE>      has appropriate permissions to edit user accounts, such as
      Administrator or Account Operators.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedit.exe or Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Go to the following registry subkey:
<P>
   HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RemoteAccess\Parameters

<P><LI>Edit the value MaxDenials to the number of consecutive bad password
   attempts before locking out the account.
<P>
   NOTE: The default value of 0 disables RAS account lockout.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
