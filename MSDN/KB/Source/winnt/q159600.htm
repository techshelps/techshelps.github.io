The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Explain details for the Server object, Sessions Errored Out counter in
Performance Monitor, reads as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   The number of sessions that have been closed due to unexpected error
   conditions. Indicates how frequently network problems are causing
   dropped sessions on the server.

</PRE>This explanation fails to mention that this counter also increments when
normal session disconnects occur as a result of the AUTODISCONNECT
parameter. The AUTODISCONNECT value represents the number of minutes that
idle sessions have before being disconnected automatically by a server. The
default value is 15 minutes. This counter increments as a result of normal
server operation, not as an indication of network problems. When this
counter increments as the result of network problems, other symptoms occur,
which may indicate a problem exists. If network users connected to the
server remain unaffected when this counter increments, then automatic
disconnections and reconnections occur normally. Therefore, this behavior
is considered an expected condition, not an unexpected error condition as
the Explain button currently reads.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 and
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
