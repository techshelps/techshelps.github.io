The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using a VESA 800x600 video driver with the Diamond Viper
video card, there may be some unusual behavior with the mouse, the
keyboard and Program Manager. You may be unable to select items with
the mouse, the keyboard may be disabled outside of the Main group, and
you may not be able to move groups.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Diamond Viper video card is not on the Hardware Compatibility List
for Windows NT version 3.1. The Windows NT 3.1 generic drivers for VGA
640x480 and VESA 800x600 are not expected to work correctly with this
video card.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
A Diamond Viper PCI driver for Windows NT can be obtained from the Gateway
2000 BBS at (605) 232-2224. This driver is contained in a self-extracting
file named VPWN32.EXE (Video Library section). Note that this driver is
currently in beta test and unsupported by Gateway.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
NOTE: In Windows NT version 3.5, Viper cards using a 1.x or 2.x BIOS
revision do not work, and these cards cannot be upgraded. There are four
different physical revisions of the Viper. One uses a series 1.x BIOS, two
use a series 2.x BIOS, and one uses a series 3.x BIOS. If you look in the
HCL you will note that it states that the Viper must have a BIOS version
3.09, Rev. for "proper performance." Translated, this means if you have
anything other than a Rev. E board, this will not work. And if you have a
Rev. E board, you need BIOS 3.09.
<P>
The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
