<P>
<PRE>                          MORE INFORMATION
                          ================

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Access for Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
Under Windows NT version 4.0, Microsoft Access for Windows 95 may generate
errors that it can't resolve, particularly when using the Form wizard. This
problem will be fixed in a later version of Access 95. Contact Microsoft
Access Product Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Bookshelf '94</h3>
 
<P>
Bookshelf '94 may exhibit unexpected behavior when you click some of the
options on the main menu bar.  An example of this behavior  is when you
click the Tools menu. The menu title displayed as "ls Books" instead of
"Tools" as expected.  This can be solved by changing  MENUPATTERN=1  to
MENUPATTERN=0  in the [OPTIONS] section of BS94.ini.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft C/C++ 7.0a</h3>
 
<P>
CodeView for Windows (CVW.EXE) is not supported. To debug 16-bit Windows-
based applications, use the Windows NT debugger, WINDBG.EXE or the
character-mode version of CodeView.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Dinosaurs</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Dinosaurs does not install the Macromind Multimedia Player (MMP)
when installed on Windows NT. You must copy MMCMMP.DRV and MMP.DLL from the
\XFILES\DRIVERS folder on the Microsoft Dinosaurs compact disc to the
\systemroot\SYSTEM directory. After copying the files you must add the
following entries to the Registry by using Registry Editor:
<P>
Add the REG_SZ value MMMovie=MCIMMP.DRV to the key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\MCI

</PRE>Add the REG_SZ value mmm=MMMOVIE.DRV to the key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
   \MCI Extensions

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Encarta 95</h3>
 
<P>
There are known problems printing from Encarta 95 to PCL printers in 24bpp
when metafile spooling is turned on. You can work around this problem by
either turning off metafile spooling or by switching to 8 color or 256
color depth in the printer's document properties dialog box. To change the
settings, click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers. Right-
click the printer, then click Document Defaults. If necessary, click the
Advanced tab. Click Document Options to disable metafile spooling.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Entertainment Pack, Idlewild</h3>
 
<P>
To use Idlewild screen savers with Windows NT, the full path to the screen
savers must be added to the system path. You can either add the screen
savers directory to the path in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or use the System
icon in Control Panel to add an environment variable containing the path.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
A General Protection Fault occurs when saving a file with an embedded
PowerPoint(r) object. The RISC version of Excel returns different function
values than values returned by x86 compatible versions.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
The RISC versions of Microsoft Excel 5.0c for Windows NT for DEC Alpha,
MIPS, and PowerPC return different function values than values returned by
x86 compatible version.
<P>
Windows NT version 4.0 allows you to compress NTFS drives. If you use the
File Open dialog box in Excel 5.0c for Windows NT to view files on a
compressed  NTFS drive, files will not be displayed. This might also affect
any macro commands designed to open or read files. This situation occurs
only on the x86 platform. The Digital Alpha, MIPS, PowerPC, and 16-bit
versions of Microsoft Excel are not affected. Excel 5.0c for Windows NT
reads non-compressed NTFS or FAT drives correctly.
<P>
There are two ways to view your Excel 5.0c for Windows NT spreadsheet files
on a compressed drive:

<UL><LI>From the File Open dialog box in Excel 5.0c for Windows NT, type the
   name of the file you want to open in the File Name box, and then press
   ENTER
<P>
   - Or -

<LI>From Explorer, double click the spreadsheet file you want to open.
<P>
</UL><h3>Microsoft Explorapedia</h3>
 
<P>
The Readme file included with Microsoft Explorapedia states that non-intel
( MIPS, Alpha,  PPC, or RISC processors ) running Windows NT are not
supported. Windows NT version 4.0 now supports these processors.  You must
have administrator privileges to install this software application.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Money for Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
Under Windows NT, the Microsoft Money 95 application experiences problems
with online banking and online stock quotes. This will be fixed in a future
release of Money 95.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Money for Windows 95, version 4.0 or 4.0a</h3>
 
<P>
To use online banking and online stock quotes in Money for Windows 95 on a
computer running Windows NT Workstation, you must be able to dial out.
Before you can dial out using TAPI services, replace the Xsnpc.dll file in
the system folder of MSMONEY with the Windows NT version 4.0 release of the
Microsoft FAST Xsnpc.dll file dated March 29, 1996.
<P>
This file can be found at www.microsoft.com and this file will be included
in the next release of  Money for Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office 95 Applications</h3>
 
<P>
Changing window focus with any Microsoft Office 95 application open may
cause screen refresh or display problems, particularly on multiprocessor
systems. Contact Microsoft Product Service Support for a new version of
mso95.dll which resolves the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office Standard for Windows 95 version 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you install Microsoft Office Standard for Windows '95 version 7.0 onto a
machine running Windows NT version 4.0, you will receive an error stating
"Failure to load expression service" when using the Access ODBC driver from
Office applications such as Excel or Word.
<P>
To correct this problem you need to obtain the Microsoft Office for Windows
<PRE>'95 version 7.0b release from Microsoft Product Support.  You can obtain a
</PRE>copy of this release by calling the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561.

</PRE><h3>Microsoft ODBC SDK 2.1</h3>
 
<P>
The setup program for Microsoft ODBC SDK 2.1 does not correctly identify
Windows NT as the current operating system and displays the following
message:
<P>
<PRE>   "This application uses CTL3D32.DLL which is not the correct version.
    This version of CTL3D32.DLL is designed only for WIN32s or Windows 95
    systems?

</PRE>Rename the file %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\CTL3D32.DLL and copy the file
\ODBCSDK\REDIST32\WINNT\CTL3D32.DLL to %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32.

<P>
When running Publisher under Windows NT, the text on some buttons is
truncated.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Schedule+ 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
When running under Windows NT, Schedule+ 7.0 requires the CTL3D32.DLL. This
DLL is not installed by the Office 95 Setup Program, so you must copy it
from the Office Pro compact disc #1. Copy the file OS\SYSTEM\CTL3D32.DLL to
your systemroot\system32 directory.
<P>
If you are upgrading from Windows NT 3.51 and have already installed Office
for Windows 95 prior to upgrading, you will not need to copy this DLL.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft SNA Server</h3>
 
<P>
The SNA Administrator currently displays the wrong version number when you
click About on the Help menu. On the MIPS platform only, SNA Server 2.11
and the SNA Server Windows NT client display incomplete text in dialog
boxes. To obtain an update, contact:

<PRE>   the MSSNA forum Lib #4 (unsupported third-party library)
   ftp.microsoft.com in /bussys/winnt/sna-unsup-ed/readme.txt (index file)

</PRE>Running SNA Server:
<P>
During the course of testing SNA Server 2.0 on Windows NT, two problems
were discovered in SNA Server 2.0 as a result of the improved parameter
checking and fault detection included in Windows NT. These do not affect
the operation of SNA Server 2.0 on Windows NT 3.1.
<P>
The symptoms include SDLC and X.25 SNA connections that will not activate
and 802.2 SNA connections that cause an exception in SNALINK.EXE. Fixes for
these problems are available in the Library 2 section of the MSSNA forum on
CompuServe.
<P>
If you have SNA Server 2.0 installed on your system, please copy the
contents of the SNA directory to your snaroot\SYSTEM directory after you
have upgraded your system to Windows NT version 4.0.
<P>
The contents of the SNA directory are:
IBMSDLC.DLLIBMX25.DLLSNADLC.DLL
<P>
Microsoft recommends that you use SNA Server version 2.1 or 2.11 on all
Windows NT version 4.0 systems. Please refer to the MSSNA forum on
CompuServe for any additional updates or notices.

<P><h3>Microsoft SQL Server for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
If you create a new window using Tools/Windows/Form Window,
Tools/Windows/Table Window, Tools/Windows/DialogBox, or
Tools/Windows/MDIWindow, the form window box shows the title "frm1 tled"
instead of "frm1 (untitled)."
<P>
At the end of installation, always choose Replace Existing Program Group,
even on the first installation. If you choose to create a new program
group, any name used will be considered invalid.
<P>
Report templates which are created or modified using Report Windows cannot
be saved. The application reports it cannot create temporary files. This
problem is fixed in Windows SQL Server 6.0.

<P>
Close and exit Quick View Plus, including any open viewing windows, before
attempting to remove Quick View Plus by using Add/Remove Programs in
Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Quicken version 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
The communications portion of Quicken version 4.0 will only run on Windows
NT version 4.0 if it is installed on x86-compatible computers.
<P>
<P><h3>Quicken version 5.0 and Quicken Deluxe version 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
Quicken 5.0 will not install on Window NT version 4.0 because the
installation program is looking for Program Manager (Progman.exe) in the
Windows directory. Windows NT includes a 32-bit version of Progman.exe in
the System32 directory.
<P>
If Windows NT version 4.0 has not been installed in the same directory as
Windows 95 or Windows version 3.1,  copy Progman.exe into the systemroot
(for example c:\winnt) directory before installing Quicken 5.0. After
Quicken is installed, delete Progman.exe from the systemroot directory.
<P>
If Windows NT version 4.0 has been installed in the same directory as
Windows 95 or Windows version 3.1, the Windows 95 or Windows 3.1 version of
Progman.exe will already be in the Windows directory.
<P>
Copy the existing version of Progman.exe to another directory before
copying  the 32-bit version of Progman.exe from the System32 directory to
the Windows directory. After Quicken is installed, copy the Windows 95 or
the Windows 3.1 version of Progman.exe back into the Windows directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Reflection 2</h3>
 
<P>
Only a small portion of the printer icon appears in the Print dialog. If
you have more than one printer, you can select any of them in the Print
Setup dialog, but the change is not reflected in the Print dialog and all
hard copy is sent to the default printer.
<P>
<P><h3>Remotely Possible/32</h3>
 
<P>
If you have Remotely Possible/32 version 2.0 or 2.1 installed on computer
running Windows NT 3.51, you must uninstall Remotely Possible before
installing Windows NT 4.0. If you do not, Windows NT will not install
correctly. You can uninstall Remotely Possible by running the Remove.bat
file located on the Remotely Possible distribution disk. After you have
upgraded to Windows NT, you can reinstall Remotely Possible.
<P>
Remotely Possible/32 versions 2.0 and 2.1 do not enter Host mode under
Windows NT version 4.0. Remotely Possible/32 can be run in client mode
under Windows NT version 4.0 and can connect with Window NT 3.51 and

<P>
When Serif PagePlus Home/Office is installed, the program group icons
"PagePlus Home Office Online Documentation", "PagePlus Home Office Readme"
and "Serif PagePlus Home Office" icons are not added to the Start menu.
Normally, the icons would appear when you click Start, point to Programs,
and then click Serif Applications/(missing filename). The icons do not
appear because the application's install program creates a filename with a
forward slash (/) in it ("...Home/Office").  Because Windows NT maintains
POSIX compatibility, forward slashes are directory separators.

<UL><LI>The 16-bit IDE interprets the Windows NT version incorrectly and
   displays user interface elements incorrectly. The 32-bit IDE interprets
   the Windows NT version number incorrectly and looks for the wrong
   filenames when you chose a Help menu option or click a Help button in a
   dialog box. You can add the necessary help files by following the
   "Instructions for users running NT 3.50 only" in the Using Symantec C++
   Help on Windows NT section of the Readme.txt file located on the
   Symantec C++ CD in the \sc\readme directory.

<LI>When setting the colors using the Color tab in the Settings dialog box
   in the 16-bit IDE, many of the color changes in the color selection
   boxes are not accurately reflected in the color boxes of the dialog
   boxes or in the 16-bit IDE itself. (The Settings dialog box is accessed
   by clicking Environment Setting on the Environment menu.)
