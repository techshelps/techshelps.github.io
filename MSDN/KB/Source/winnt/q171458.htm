The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When an application tries to open large files (over 100MB), the open
request may fail with one of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>Insufficient Resources
<P>
   - or –

<LI>Invalid Handle
<P>
</UL>The actual error returned varies depending on the application being used
to open the file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The allocation for paged-pool memory was modified to correct any problem
that might occur on systems that have large files (greater 100MB) that are
repeatedly opened sequentially, updated, and then closed.
<P>
Ntoskrnl.exe and Ntkrnlmp.exe have been updated to correct this problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT 3.51</h3>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem on Windows NT 3.51, obtain and install the hotfix.
You must restart the computer for the fix to take effect. No registry
changes are required on Windows NT 3.51.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem on Windows NT 4.0, obtain the following fix or
wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
<P>
The fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   10/31/97  5:00p               916,352 Ntoskrnl.exe (Intel)
   10/31/97  5:01p               936,064 Ntkrnlmp.exe (Intel)

   10/31/97  2:22p             1,368,128 Ntoskrnl.exe (Alpha)
   10/31/97  2:23p             1,395,456 Ntkrnlmp.exe (Alpha)

</PRE>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry
Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys
And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics

it.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor, locate and select the following Registry subkey
   in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control
      \Session Manager\Memory Management
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, click Add Value.

<P><LI>Enter DisablePagedPoolHint as the value name and set the Data Type to
   REG_DWORD.

<P><LI>Click OK and enter 1 as the Data.
