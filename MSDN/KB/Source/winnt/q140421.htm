The information in this article applies to:

</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Even though the Windows NT Concepts and Planning Guide states on page 88
that you should be able to log on using cached profiles on the local
workstation, users are denied access, are unable to log on, and the
following error message appears if the server based mandatory profile is
not available:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to log you on because your mandatory profile is not available.
   Please contact your administrator.

</PRE><h3>Windows NT Concepts and Planning Guide Excerpt</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows NT Concepts and Planning Guide states on page 88:
<P>
"If a user has a personal profile, the per-user settings are saved to both
the user's personal profile and the locally cached version of the profile
when the user logs off. The locally cached profile is identical to the
updated personal profile.
<P>
If a user has a mandatory profile, changes made by the user during a
session are not uploaded to the mandatory profile when the user logs off-
the user can never change the mandatory profile. However, if the mandatory
profile allows the user to make changes during a session, any changes made
by the user are saved in the locally cached version of the mandatory
profile. So, the next time the user logs on at this workstation, if the
user's mandatory profile is unavailable, the locally cached profile is
loaded, and the user will have the changes made during his or her last
session."
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Mandatory profiles do not get cached on the local workstations.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This is a documentation error.
<P>
If a user logs on and both the server-based profile and local version of
the profile are unavailable, the user is logged on using the computer's
default profile, if the user has a personal profile. If the user has a
mandatory profile, the logon attempt is denied. This is expected for
mandatory profiles.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
