<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Domain Name Service (DNS) Server has
the ability to interact with a Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) Server.
This article discusses this feature and the process that takes place when a
DNS Server forwards a query to a WINS Server.
<P>
For additional information on DNS, please see the following whitepaper
available on the Microsoft anonymous ftp server:
<P>
<PRE>   File Name: Dnswp.exe
   Location : <B><A HREF="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-docs/papers/">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-docs/papers/</A></B>
   Title    : "DNS and Microsoft Windows NT 4.0"

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To allow for interoperability between DNS and WINS, two new resource
records were defined as part of the Windows NT DNS implementation. The
following are the two new records:

<UL><LI>WINS Lookup

<LI>WINS-R Lookup (WINS Reverse Lookup)
<P>
</UL><h3>WINS Lookup</h3>
 
<P>
The first new record is called a WINS Lookup record and can only be a part
of the zone root domain. Any queries that cannot be resolved by the static
entries in the DNS zone file will be forwarded to the WINS server(s)
defined by the WINS Lookup record. This function is particularly useful for
Unix clients that may need to contact DHCP/WINS enabled clients through IP.
<P>
The process that takes place is as follows:

<OL><P><LI>A client sends a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) query to the
   DNS Server.

<P><LI>The DNS Server, being unable to resolve the name locally, truncates
   the domain name from the host name and forwards the query to the
   configured WINS Server(s). The DNS Server uses a source port of UDP
   53 (DNS) and a destination port of UDP 137 (NetBIOS Name Service).
   It also encrypts the name that it sends to the WINS Server.
<P>
   For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q160828.htm">Q160828</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Network Monitor Parses DNS WINS Lookup queries as DNS
                  Packets

</PRE><P><LI>The WINS Server responds to the DNS Server with the resolved IP
   address and a source port of UDP 137 and destination port UDP 53.

<P><LI>The DNS Server forwards the IP address in response to the client's
   original query.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: For network administrators who are familiar with protocol analyzers,
a sample of packets has been included at the end of this article to display
the actual network data that is exchanged in the above steps.
<P>
<P><h3>WINS-R Lookup</h3>
 
<P>
There is also a WINS-R or WINS Reverse Lookup entry that can be added to
the reverse zone. Because WINS does not have a reverse lookup capability,
however, this record instructs the DNS server to perform a NetBIOS node
adapter status lookup, or an NS Query, against the host.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q154553.htm">Q154553</A></B>
   TITLE     : Windows NT 4.0 DNS WINS Reverse Lookups Do Not Use WINS

</PRE></OL>NOTE: The WINS Lookup and the WINS-R Lookup resource records are
proprietary to the Microsoft NT DNS Server. You will want to prevent the
resource records from being propagated in a zone transfer to a non-Windows
NT DNS Server. This can be accomplished by using one of the following
methods:

<UL><LI>Add the Local flag to the WINS record in the zone file using the
   following steps:
<P>
   1. Type the following at a command prompt, and then press Enter:
<P>
<PRE>         net stop dns

   2. Using a text editor, open your zone file. For example, if your
      zone is Domain.com, then your default zone file name is
      Domain.com.dns.

   3. Locate the WINS record, and insert LOCAL so that your WINS record
      looks similar to the following:

         @   0   IN   WINS   LOCAL   a.b.c.d

      where a.b.c.d is the IP address of your WINS Server.

   4. Save the file and exit the editor.

   5. Type the following at a command prompt, and then press Enter:

         net start dns

   -or-

</PRE><LI>Enable the Settings Only Affect Local Server option using the following
   steps:
<P>
   1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools,
<P><PRE>      and then click DNS Manager.
</PRE><P>
   2. Double-click your DNS Server, right-click the zone name that contains
<P><PRE>      the WINS record, and then click Properties.
</PRE><P>
   3. In the Zone Properties dialog, click on the WINS Lookup tab and click
<P><PRE>      the Settings Only Affect Local Server option to enable it.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>Network Monitor Trace Information</h3>
 
<P>
Network Monitor is a protocol analyzer that is available with Microsoft
Systems Management Server (SMS). Corresponding to the four steps listed
above there are four frames of data following to further illustrate the
process involved when a Windows NT DNS Server forwards a query to a WINS
Server.
