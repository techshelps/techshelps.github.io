</PRE>Before you can run the Setup program to install the Microsoft Network
Client, you must download the appropriate disk image files, and create
floppy disk installation sets of the Network Client files. For MS-DOS based
clients, there are five files that you must download. For OS/2 based
clients, there are four files that you must download. Each file is a self-
extracting zip file that expands into a disk image of one of the
installation disks.

naming convention is
<P>
<PRE>   DSKx-n.EXE (for MS-DOS based clients)

floppies, or 5 for 5.25-inch 1.2 MB floppies), and n specifies the disk
number (1 to 5 for MS-DOS based client, 1 to 4 for OS/2 based client).
<P>
To create a floppy disk installation set, use the following syntax to copy
each of the disk images to an external drive
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;filename&gt; -d &lt;destination drive&gt;

</PRE>at the command prompt. The -d indicates that the directories on DSK3-1.EXE
are to be copied onto a disk located in the B drive. For example, to create
a 3.5-inch (1.44 MB) floppy disk of DSK3-1.EXE, type the following:
<P>
<PRE>   DSK3-1.EXE -d b:

</PRE>For the Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS, label each of the five disks
