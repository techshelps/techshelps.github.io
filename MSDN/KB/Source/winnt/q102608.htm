Some of the major differences in security schemes between Windows NT
Advanced Server and Microsoft LAN Manager are:

<UL><LI>Under Windows NT Advanced Server, user and group permissions are
   cumulative. Deny access takes precedence over grant access. Under LAN
   Manager, individual user permissions take precedence over group
   permissions.
<P>
   NOTE: When Windows NT Advanced Server checks permissions, it does so
   in one pass, not discriminating between users and groups. As soon as a
   "deny access" permission is reached, the search is terminated and
   access to the resource is denied. However, LAN Manager makes two
   passes when it checks resource permissions: a user pass and a group
   pass. Because of this, LAN Manager could deny a user access, but then
   grant that user access if the user belongs to a group that has access
   to a resource.

<LI>A Windows NT Advanced Server domain contains only domain
   controllers and servers. All servers are considered backup domain
   controllers. A LAN Manager domain includes a primary domain
   controller, backup controllers, and stand-alone servers.
<P>
   NOTE: LAN Manager servers in a Windows NT Advanced Server domains
   cannot act as domain controllers, nor can they validate logon
   attempts by Windows NT or Windows NT Advanced Server computers. LAN
   Manager servers can validate LAN Manager server and client logons in a
   mixed domain of LAN Manager and Windows NT computers.

<LI>Under Windows NT Advanced Server, you must logon to any local
   computer with an account and password. Local computer security is
   optional under LAN Manager, only on computers configured to be
   servers.
<P>
   NOTE: Users from outside a domain with both Windows NT Advanced Server
   and LAN Manager computers cannot access LAN Manager domain resources
   unless a local account is created in Windows NT Advanced Server. This
   is because LAN Manager servers do not recognize global groups or trust
   relationships.

<LI>Windows NT Advanced Server supports trust relationships between
   domains and a single network for all trusted domains. LAN Manager does
   not support trust relationships and requires that users log onto each
   domain separately.

<LI>Any user account can own a file under Windows NT Advanced Server.
   Owners can grant and deny access to the files they own. This concept
   is not supported under LAN Manager.

<LI>Windows NT Advanced Server allows you to deny access to resources
   not owned by administrative accounts. Ownership may be taken later,
   but an auditing trail is created. LAN Manager allows all
   administrative accounts to access all resources.

<LI>Windows NT Advanced Server protects setting system functions (such
   as setting the system time and formatting the hard disk.) System
   functions are not protected under LAN Manager.

<LI>Local and global groups are recognized by Windows NT Advanced
   Server. LAN Manager does not recognize local groups.

<LI>Windows NT Advanced Server allows only Windows NT computers to
   administrate other Windows NT computers. LAN Manager computers can be
   administrated from any MS-DOS, UNIX, or OS/2 computer running LAN
   Manager, or from a Windows NT computer.

<LI>File and directory permissions apply to local and network users
   under Windows NT Advanced Server. Permissions apply only to network
   users, unless local security is enabled on LAN Manager servers.
