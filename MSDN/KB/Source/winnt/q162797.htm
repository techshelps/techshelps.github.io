<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to access a computer running Windows NT Server or Workstation
that is a member of your domain with one of the following methods, it fails
with one of the messages listed below.

<UL><LI>At a command prompt, type either of the following commands:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Net Use \\&lt;ComputerName&gt;\&lt;Share&gt;
</PRE><P>
   -or-
<P>
<P><PRE>      Net View \\&lt;ComputerName&gt;
</PRE><P>
   You receive the following message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      System Error 1789 has occurred. The trust relationship between this
      workstation and the primary domain failed.
</PRE>
<LI>You are in Server Manager and try to view the computer's properties. You
   receive the following message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary
      domain failed.
</PRE>
<LI>You are in User Manager and try to add a user account from the Member
   Server or Workstation's database. You receive the following error
   message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary
      domain failed.
</PRE>
<LI>In Event Viewer on the Member Server or Workstation, you receive Event
   ID 5722:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The session setup to the Windows NT Domain Controller &lt;Unknown&gt; for
      the domain &lt;DomainName&gt; failed because the Windows NT Domain
      Controller does not have an account for the computer &lt;ComputerName&gt;.
</PRE><P>
</UL>- When you attempt to log on to the console, you receive the message:
<P>
<PRE>   System can not log you on to the domain because the systems computer
   account in its primary domain is missing or the password on that
   account is incorrect.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The computer's machine account has the incorrect role or its password has
become mismatched with that of the domain database.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Log on locally as a local administrator. In the Network tool of Control
Panel, select Change and enter a Workgroup name, leaving the domain.
Restart the computer and log on locally as a local administrator.
<P>
There are two methods to rejoin the domain:

<UL><LI>You can join the domain from the client if at the same time you can
   provide an administrator username and password on the domain.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You can delete the existing computer account in Server Manager, recreate
   the computer account, synchronize the domain, and then on the client
   rejoin the domain.
