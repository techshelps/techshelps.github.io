The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may be unable to install Windows NT on a IDE drive larger than 504
megabytes (MB) or an IDE drive using more than 1024 cylinders (as
configured in the CMOS settings). You may receive messages such as "STOP
0x0000007B INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE" when NT reboots and starts the
graphical user interface (GUI) portion of setup. If you are installing
Windows NT from floppy disk, the problem occurs on Disk 9.
<P>
If you do get Windows NT installed, Windows NT may:

<UL><LI>Not recognize the drive as the correct size. For example, it may
   see 500 MB free on a 504 MB drive.

<LI>Not recognize the drive even though it is recognized by other
   operating systems (such as MS-DOS).

<LI>See the full drive while other operating systems (such as MS-DOS) see
   only 500 MB of the drive.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when Windows NT Setup truncates the drive parameters to
1024 cylinders to support interrupt 13 compatibility. Interrupt 13
compatibility is required so the master boot record (MBR) can locate the
boot sector. The boot sector then finds and loads the NT boot loader
(NTLDR) and continues to load the operating system. NT uses interrupt 13
calls until a disk driver is loaded.
<P>
Historically, interrupt 13 compatibility has a limitation of 1024
cylinders. Secondary drives not containing the boot partition may not be
limited to 1024 cylinders depending on the translation scheme used by the
controller and drive.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem:

<UL><LI>Update your AMI BIOS to a version dated at 07/25/94 or later. These
   BIOS' support logical block addressing (LBA).

<LI>Purchase and install an IDE controller that has a built in translating
   BIOS. For example, the IDE controllers made by Buslogic and Promise
   provide translation functions so you don't need an updated BIOS. These
   are sometimes referred to as enhanced IDE controllers. Since the
   controller operates in place of the system BIOS it should work with any
   IDE drive currently available.

<LI>Partition the drive into partitions smaller than 500 Mb with MS-DOS
   FDISK and then install Windows NT on one of these partitions. The
   partitions must not exceed 1024 cylinders.
<P>
   NOTE: The above workarounds require you change CMOS settings and
   reformat your hard drive before you install Windows NT. Backup any data
   from your hard disk drive before making these changes.

<LI>Use Ontrack Disk Manager to partition and format the large IDE hard disk
   drive.
<P>
   For information on using Ontrack Disk Manager to do this, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q124910.htm">Q124910</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Using Ontrack Disk Manager to Support Large IDE Drives

</PRE></UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
LBA allows the CMOS to provide sector translation so that the drive's
physical parameters are hidden from the operating system. LBA does this by
translating the drive's physical parameters into logical parameters, and
then storing them in an enhanced parameter table. The value for the number
of cylinders is set at the MS-DOS limit of 1024, and the value for the
number of heads is increased. For example, a drive having 2048 cylinders,
16 heads, and 63 sectors per track could be reported as having 1024
cylinders, 32 heads, and 63 Sectors per track.
<P>
LBA uses the following algorithm for determining the level of
translation to use:
<P>
<PRE>   If the total number of sectors is less than 1032192 (FC000 hex), the
   drive is less than or equal to 528 MB; translation usually isn't needed.

   If the total number of sectors is less than or equal to 2164531 (210733
   hex), the drive is greater than 528 MB but less than or equal to 1056.9
   MB; the number of heads is set at 32.

   If the total number of sectors is less than or equal to 4329267 (420f33
   hex), the drive is greater than 1056.9 MB but less than or equal to
   2113.9 MB;  the number of heads is set at 64.

   If the total number of sectors is less than or equal to 86558534 (841e66
   hex), the drive is greater than 2113.9 MB but less than or equal to
   4227.8 MB; the number of heads is set at 128.

   If the total number of sectors is greater than 8658534 (841e66 hex), the
   drive is greater than 4227.8 MB; the number of heads is set at 255.

<P>
You may purchase an updated BIOS by calling UniCore Software Inc. at (800)
800-2467. If you are using AMI BIOS, please provide, when calling, the
information that appears in the bottom left corner of your screen when you
boot your computer. This information identifies the core chipset.
