The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Nslookup from a command prompt on your Microsoft Windows
NT 4.0 Domain Name Service (DNS) server, you receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   **** Can't find server name for address x.x.x.x: Non-existent domain
   **** Default server is not available
   Default Server: UnKnown
   Address:  x.x.x.x

</PRE>Where x.x.x.x is the IP address of your DNS server.
<P>
NOTE: This problem may occur with other applications as well.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is a missing or mis-configured PTR record for your DNS server in your
reverse lookup zone. The DNS Manager does not automatically create a PTR
record for your DNS server, even though it may automatically create an A
record in your forward zone.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>From DNS Manager, open your forward zone.

<P><LI>Right-click on the A record for your DNS server, and then click Delete
   Record.

<P><LI>Click Yes to confirm the deletion of the A record.

<P><LI>Right-click on the forward zone, and then click New Host.

<P><LI>Type the host name of your DNS server and the IP address.

<P><LI>Select the Create Associated PTR Record check box.

<P><LI>Click Add Host, and then click Done.
<P>
</OL>If you receive an error when you click Add Host, then you may be having a
problem with your reverse lookup zone.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Microsoft DNS Server Reverse Lookup Error Adding Host Record

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q162842.htm">Q162842</A></B>
   TITLE     : DNS with "WINS Reverse Lookup" Fails with Multiple IP
               Addresses

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can view the properties of an A record by right-clicking on it and then
clicking Properties. When the above problem is encountered, the A record
properties will have a check in Update Associated PTR Record. This seems to
indicate that the PTR record has been created and is active, however, it is
not true.
<P>
The reverse lookup zone is a database file that is used to allow a client,
or resolver, to provide an IP address and request a matching host name.
This file contains an SOA record and NS records similar to other DNS
database zone files. It also contains pointer records.
<P>
This DNS reverse lookup capability is important because some applications
provide these capabilities to implement security based on the connecting
host names. Nslookup is one of these utilities.
