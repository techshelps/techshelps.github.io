<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Windows NT Service Packs (SP), you may need to re-install
customized Windows NT components or drivers provided by original equipment
manufacturer (OEM).
<P>
Some OEM-provided drivers and components can be required to ensure proper
operation of some Windows NT installations. An example of OEM software is
the Compaq Support Software Diskette (SSD). Installed Compaq SSD components
can require reinstallation or updates after installing a Windows NT Service
Pack. While Service Packs can update some OEM related components, Microsoft
recommends to reinstall the OEM provided software after installing a
Microsoft Windows NT Service Pack.
<P>
For best results, contact the supplier of the OEM drivers to obtain current
drivers, or to inquire about compatibility with Microsoft Windows NT
Service Packs. The manufacturer usually has special instructions for
updating operating system components.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Compaq SSD's (Software Support Diskettes, also called SoftPaq's) create the
Compaq Support Software for Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0 diskette plus
four other diskettes that support the subsystems and features for Compaq
Servers and Professional Workstations. These device drivers / files are
written by Compaq to maximize hardware capabilities. Updates and/or
additions to their driver files are periodically rolled together into a
single deliverable or  "version". SoftPaq's can copy files directly to
harddisk or make installation diskettes.
<P>
Each version can be recognized by the date/time stamp on the files
themselves.  Files issued together in a single version have a common
timestamp (ie, Version 1.22, Revision A files show a timestamp of 1.22am.)
<P>
Current (7/7/97) is Version 1.22 Revision A (Release date 13 May 1997). It
includes:
<P>
•NetFlex/NetFlex-2/NetFlex-3 network adapter family •NetFlex-3 network
adapter monitoring, configuration and duplex utility •Compaq 10T PCI UTP
and 10/100 TX PCI UTP •IDA/IDA-2 disk controller •SMART/SMART-2 array
controller •32-Bit SCSI-2 Family of controllers •ProLiant Storage System
•System Management/Health driver •UPS support •Compaq HAL Support (ISA,
Uniprocessor, and Multiprocessor) •Compaq Recovery Server, Standby Agent
with SMART-2 support •Compaq Recovery Server, Online Agent with SMART-2
support •Compaq Remote Insight Board driver •Compaq Support Software
diskette Installation utility •Matrox Millennium video controller •ELSA
Gloria-L video controller •ESS AudioDrive audio controller
<P>
The following diskettes can be created when the SoftPaq is unbundled:
•Disk 1 - Compaq Support Software for Microsoft NT 3.51 and 4.0 Disk #1
•Disk 2 - Compaq Support Software for Microsoft NT 3.51 and 4.0 Disk #2
•Disk 3 - Matrox MGA Millennium Video Drivers and ESS 1868 Audio Drivers
<PRE>          for Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0
</PRE>•Disk 4 - ELSA Gloria-L Video Drivers for Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.
•Disk 5 - ELSA Gloria-L Video Drivers for Microsoft Windows NT 3.51
<P>
For the previous Version, see Ver. 1.21 Revision A (27 March 1997)
<P>
An ASCII version list of the current SoftPaq files can be found at Compaq's
Web site or on their FTP server at:
<P>
<B>ftp://ftp.compaq.com/pub/softpaq/allfiles.txt</B>
<P>
<P>
SPECIAL NOTE:
Prior to version 1.21a, SSD/SoftPaq's  were Windows NT version specific -
one for WinNT 3.51 and a different SSD / SoftPaq for WinNT4.0.
<P>
Beginning with version 1.22a, the same SoftPaq/SSD works for either WinNT
version 3.51 or 4.0 and for server or workstation.
<P>
The process of applying SSD's is similar to an upgrade of NT or the
application of a service pack. It essentially updates the existing files
and drivers already installed on the machine. It does not load new drivers
or modify configuration settings. Registry entries are used to identify the
existing device drivers and hardware configuration that will be updated.
There is no detection process (like what happens during an initial install
of Windows NT) that allows new drivers to be added or configuration changes
to be made. New drivers must be added manually.
<P>
For best results, contact Compaq to obtain current version or to inquire
about compatibility with Microsoft Windows NT Service Packs. Compaq may
have special instructions for updating operating system components
depending on which NT service pack is installed.
<P>
