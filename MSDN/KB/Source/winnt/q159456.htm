The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Zip IDE Insider drive is a IDE-based removable media drive. This
article will discuss information about settings and troubleshooting of this
device.
<P>
Currently, the Zip IDE Insider will only work on Windows NT 4.0. Windows NT
3.51 has no removable IDE capability in its Atapi.sys driver because no
removable IDE media products were available during its product cycle.
<P>
The Windows NT 4.0 ATAPI driver is designed to recognize the new
capabilities of removable IDE products such as the IOMEGA Zip IDE Insider
or the SyQuest DataFlyer 230 IDE, and so forth.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Currently, there are no plans to add removable media IDE capability to the
Windows NT 3.51 Atapi.sys driver.
<P>
<P><h3>Zip Jumper Information</h3>
 
<P>
The Zip IDE Insider has a row of jumpers on the back of the unit that are
jumpered 1-3 and 5-6 from the factory.
<P>

                      2    4    6

</PRE>If you are having problems getting Windows NT 4.0 to use this device you
may need to jumper pins 3 and 4 together. This enables media status
notification, which is vital to its operation in Windows NT. Otherwise, the
unit will effectively emulate a hard disk drive and can even be detected by
IDE hard disk drive detection programs typical in the BIOS of a modern
computer.
<P>
1-3 Jumper is unknown at this time but appears to have no effect. 5-6
reflect Master/Slave. No jumper on 5-6 equals Slave, Jumpered equals
Master.
<P>
It is not recommended that you allow your computer's BIOS to detect
and set Cylinder/Head/Sectors settings for the Zip Insider as it will
negate its removable media properties and you will be unable to remount
another Zip disk if you eject the Zip disk while the Zip Insider is
configured as a hard drive in BIOS regardless of the operating system.
<P>
In addition, you should not format these disks with NTFS if you desire to
use several disks while in a single session of Microsoft Windows NT. This
is because NTFS is not a remountable file system and will disable software
and hardware ejections of the Zip drive while you are running Windows NT.
After you have shutdown, you can change Zip disks freely. If your Zip disks
are left formatted as FAT you change Zip disks freely.
