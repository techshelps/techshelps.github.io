<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
NetWare client computers (using NCP) on one side (Side A) of a bridge are
able to log on to NetWare servers and File and Print Services for NetWare
(FPNW) servers on both sides of the bridge. However, NetWare client
computers (using NCP) on the other side (Side B) of the bridge are able to
log on to NetWare servers and FPNW servers on Side B only.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if the bridge is configured to forward RIP broadcasts
one way only - Side A to Side B. When a NetWare client attempts to log on
to a server, a RIP broadcast for the internal IPX network number of the
server is sent. The server then sends a direct response to the client, and
the logon process continues. If the bridge is configured to only forward
RIP broadcasts from Side A to Side B, the request from a client on side B
does not reach the servers on Side A. The client may re-try sending the RIP
broadcasts several times, which eventually returns an error.
<P>
If the server on Side A sends periodic RIP broadcasts (possibly once a
minute) to Side B during the re-try period, the client on Side B will
detect the broadcast because all packets sent or received after the initial
broadcast are direct. In this case, the client on Side B is able to log on
to servers on Side A.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, configure the bridge to send RIP broadcasts in
both directions.
