The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Among Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) servers, the [1C] group name is
not replicating properly, resulting in certain WINS databases that contain
only a partial list of domain controllers in the [1C] group.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The [1C] record is not replicated because the [1C] version ID was not
updated to indicate that it had changed.
<P>
<P><h3>Description of Problem</h3>
 
<P>
When a DC registers with a WINS server, the DC will register its IP
address in the &lt;domain&gt;[1C] group, (along with any other servers already
listed,) and the WINS server will update the 'version ID' of that [1C]
record. That record will then get propagated from the WINS server, to a
partner-WINS server.
<P>
If the partner-WINS already has a previous replica (copy) of the [1C]
record, it will update its own database to include the new IP addresses in
that record, but it will not update its version ID of that [1C] record.
(The original WINS and the partner-WINS will maintain different version
IDs of the records that they pass to each other.)
<P>
At this point the partner-WINS has an updated [1C] record, however it will
not push that record to a third partner-WINS because the version ID was
not updated.
<P>
For example:
<P>
Assume a network with at least 3 WINS servers WINS_X, WINS_Y, and WINS_Z;
where WINS_X is the primary WINS server that all DCs register with; WINS_Y
and WINS_Z are sequential partners; thus, during propagation the flow of
the [1C] group is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   (WINS_X)  --&gt;  (WINS_Y)  --&gt;  (WINS_Z) ....

</PRE>Assume that initial propagation has already occurred, so that WINS_Y and
WINS_Z have a replica [1C] record. Then, a new DC registers with WINS_X,
the version ID of the [1C] record is updated, and it gets propagated to
WINS_Y. WINS_Y already has a replica of the [1C] record, so it will update
the DC addresses in that record, but not the version ID. WINS_Z then pulls
from WINS_Y, however the [1C] record was not included because the [1C]
version ID was not updated to indicate that it had changed.
<P>
The result of this is that the domain controllers in the list at WINS_Z
may get overloaded with network requests; and DC redundancy is reduced.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, you have three options.

<UL><LI>This option works best if you have all DCs registering at one
   WINS:
<P>
   1. Use WINSCL.EXE (from the Windows NT Resource Kit) to delete the [1C]
<P><PRE>      entry on all WINS databases that merely contain a replica of the
      record (that is, no DCs are registering to those WINS servers). Also
      delete any static [1C] record from any WINS (because the 'migrate
      on' feature will not resolve the problem.)
</PRE><P>
   2. From your WINS server(s) that accepts DC registrations, do something
<P><PRE>      to cause an update to the [1C] record, such as rebooting a DC, or
      typing IPCONFIG /RENEW if you are using DHCP.
</PRE><P>
   3. Force propagation to all partner WINS servers. Since owner [1C]
<P><PRE>      records are updated, and the partners do not have any replica copy
      at all, it should get completely replicated because it is a new
      record (and high version ID) at every partner.
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>Set up your WINS push/pull configuration in a star pattern, such
   that there is a central WINS where all your DCs register, and the
   partner WINS servers only replicate with the central server. In this
   configuration the problem should not occur at all.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Although Microsoft generally does not recommend using Static entries
   for computers that are WINS aware, you can overcome this problem by
   creating a static record for the [1C] domain name. This will disable
   the functionality of controllers dynamically registering their address
   in the [1C] group, however it will allow you to manually add
   controllers to the [1C] record on any partner WINS database, and thus
   have control of the list.
<P>
   NOTE: If you have a Windows NT 3.1 DC in your domain, this static
   method will be required because Windows NT 3.1 is not WINS aware.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The [1C] (that is, [1Ch] or [0x1Ch]) is a special group name registered
for use by the domain controllers (DCs) within the domain, and can contain
up to 25 IP addresses.
<P>
In a large network with more than 25 DCs, new registrations will overwrite
the oldest ones. This means that the primary DC (PDC) will remain in the
[1C] list unless it gets overwritten, too. However, when a client does a
query for the [1C] list, the PDC address will still be returned because
the PDC registers the &lt;domain&gt;[1B] name, and that address will always be
returned with the [1C] list.
<P>
The [1C] domain name is used for the following functions:

<UL><LI>Domain logon process through WINS (when Windows for Workgroups,
   Windows95, and Windows NT clients log on):
<P>
   1. A client will send a name query to the WINS server for the
<P><PRE>      &lt;domain name&gt;[1C].
</PRE><P>
   2. The WINS server will return the list of IP addresses (DCs) in the
<P><PRE>      [1C] group.
</PRE><P>
   3. The client will send a directed datagram to each DC in an attempt to
<P><PRE>      logon to the domain.
</PRE><P>
   4. The DCs will start responding to the logon request.
<P>
   5. The client will continue the logon process with the first DC that
<P><PRE>      responds; the client will ignore the other responses.
</PRE>
<LI>Secure Channel establishment:
<P>
<P><PRE>    -  Interdomain: When Windows NT workstations and servers are started,
       they will use the [1C] list of addresses to find a DC and establish
       a secure channel for their domain machine account.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    -  Trusted domains: When a DC comes up, it will set up a secure
       channel with a DC from the &lt;remote domain&gt;[1C] list. This channel
       will be used for pass-through authentication.
