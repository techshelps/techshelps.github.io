The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A user with administrator privileges from the accounts domain logs on to a
computer running Windows NT Workstation 4.0. The workstation is in the
resource domain. If the user connects to a share on the Primary Domain
Controller (PDC) of the resource domain through Windows Explorer or
Network Neighborhood, right-clicks a directory in the share, selects the
security tab and selects permissions, the workstation begins to loop. File
Manager can be used to connect to the shared directory in question.
Querying the security information will produce the same symptoms. This
loop is not detectable through the UI of the workstation or the server. It
is only detected through a network analyzer trace. The same packets are
continuously sent between the workstation and server until the Windows
Explorer dialog boxes are closed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The workstation continuously requests a notify change for the shared
directory that it connected to, and the server will respond with INVALID
USER IDENTIFIER ERROR (91). The application, Windows Explorer, indicates
that change notify completed successfully and resubmits a subsequent
change notify request. The workstation continues to send the "notify
change" request and the server continues to respond with the error
message. This loop will continue until the user on the workstation cancels
the operation by closing Network Neighborhood or Windows Explorer. This
problem only occurs the first time that a user performs the operation in
question. If the user shuts down Windows Explorer and tries again, the
extra packets are not produced. The workstation must be restarted.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, explicitly establish a connection to the
server through Net use \\servername\ipc$.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the fix mentioned below or wait for the next Windows NT service
pack. Rdr.sys has been fixed. A failure indication is returned to the
application, Windows Explorer, in the case of the change notify query. As
a result, the application does not submit a subsequent change notify
request.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A
supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
