The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
During boot, the following message is displayed in a dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   At least one service or driver failed during system startup. Use
   Event Viewer to examine the event log for details.

</PRE>Event Viewer shows a Service Control Manager event number 7024. This is
explained as: "The Messenger service terminated with service- specific
error 2270."
<P>
Further information can be obtained by using the NET HELPMSG command. Error
message 2270 is explained by the following:
<P>
<PRE>   The computer name could not be added as a message alias.
   The name may already exist on the network.

</PRE>If you are running Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 and
running WINPOPUP.EXE, and if you are logged in with the same login name,
the same error occurs. WinPopUp uses the login name and does not let the
Windows NT messenger service start.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs when the name given to the computer is not unique on the
network. Sometimes a computer will be given a name that is also a user
name.
<P>
The messenger functions by listening to the network for messages directed
to a set of aliases. The list of aliases consists of the computer name, the
user name of the current user, and any aliases added via the NET NAME
command. If there are no users logged on, the only alias that messenger can
listen to is the computer name. Therefore, the messenger always expects to
be able to add the computer name, during startup, as an alias to listen to.
If this name already exists on the network (because it was added on another
machine), the messenger is unsuccessful in adding that name, and fails to
start.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Rename the computer to a unique name by choosing the Network icon in
Control Panel. The next time you start Windows NT, the error message should
not appear.
