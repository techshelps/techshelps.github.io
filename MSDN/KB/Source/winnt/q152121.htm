SYMPTOMS
 
<P>
When you log on to a NetWare Server across a Novell router(s) (file servers
or multi-protocol routers), it may be unusually slow and sometimes may take
as long as 8 to 12 seconds. Event ID 8007 may also appear in the System
log.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This may be due to the router(s) limiting the size of the packet you
can use, particularly if this is a Token Ring network.
<P>
The response to a logon to a NetWare Server across a router may take
several seconds (as long as 8 to 12), depending on how long it takes to
negotiate the correct packet size to connect to the NetWare server.
<P>
You may also see a number of Event ID 8007 error messages in the Event
Viewer right after logging on. The response time is long because Windows NT
is negotiating the largest packet it can use to access the NetWare Server.
If the packet size used by the adapter installed in Windows NT uses a
packet size much larger than the router allows, Windows NT has to negotiate
to find out how large a packet it can use.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To shorten the logon time:
<P>
A. Configure the router to use the largest packet size possible on your
<PRE>   network. Consider all circumstances that may require you to keep the
   packet size shorter. If you do not know the packet size your router is
   using consult the router manual or contact the router manufacturer, or
   continue with B below to experiment with different packet sizes.

</PRE>B. To eliminate packet size negotiations, configure Windows NT to use the
<PRE>   packet size the router is set to.

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-
   wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct
   them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
   use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

   1. Run the Registry Editor(REGEDT32.EXE).

   2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree go to the following subkey:

         \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NwlnkIpx\NetConfig\AdapterName#

</PRE><P><LI>Check whether the entry MaxPktSize exists.
<P>
   a. If the MaxPktSize entry exists, the value may be set to 0 (zero)
<P><PRE>      which means that the packet size determined by the driver is used for
      the adapter and you need to change that value. Double-click the
      parameter value in the right window pane and skip to step 3.c.
</PRE><P>
   b. If the MaxPktSize entry does not exist:
<P>
<P><PRE>      1. From the Edit menu, choose Add Value and add the following
<PRE></PRE>         information when prompted:

            Value Name: MaxPktSize
            Data Type : REG_DWORD

      2. Choose Ok.

   c. In the DWORD Editor dialog box set the Data field to the packet size
      the router is configured for. If you are not sure what that is, you
      can test with various values to see what works best. It may be best
      to start with a value of 1024 (decimal) and work up or down from
      there.

</PRE></OL>This limits the negotiation process and should enable the logon to occur
much faster. You should also see fewer 8007 errors.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
