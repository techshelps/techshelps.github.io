<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a DHCP client initiates a renewal of an IP address, and the DHCP
server which leased the address is unavailable, the client may indicate an
IP address of 0.0.0.0 after the lease expires, and take five minutes to
receive an address from another DHCP server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When 50 percent of the lease time has expired for a leased address, the
client tries to renew the lease with the DHCP server that originally
assigned it. If the client is unable to communicate with the original DHCP
server, and 87.5 percent of the lease time has expired, the client tries to
renew the lease by broadcasting a request to any available DHCP server.
However, this broadcast contains a request to renew the IP address
currently held by the client, and is not equivalent to a request made by a
client which has no current IP address. If the lease expires, the client
discontinues the use of the IP address previously leased, waits for five
minutes, and begins again with a new IP Lease Request.
<P>
The following scenario illustrates how a DHCP client responds when
attempting to renew an address where the DHCP server that originally leased
the address to the client becomes unavailable.

<OL><P><LI>The client successfully leases an address from DHCP server 1
   (example:  1.1.10.8).  At this point, DHCP server 2 is down.

<P><LI>DHCP server 1's DHCP service is stopped, and DHCP server 2 is brought
   up.

<P><LI>At 50 percent lease expiration, the client attempts to contact the DHCP
   server that originally leased the address. Inside this packet, the IP
   address currently being leased is included.

<P><LI>No response is received from DHCP server 1.

<P><LI>At 87.5 percent lease expiration, the client attempts to broadcast to
   any DHCP server; however, the IP address currently being leased is
   included in the packet.

<P><LI>At lease expiration, the client ceases to use the IP address originally
   leased from DHCP server 1.

<P><LI>Five minutes later, TCP/IP re-initializes and sends a broadcast for any
   DHCP server. (The DHCPDISCOVER packet here includes an IP address of
   "0.0.0.0".)
<P>
</OL>On Windows NT, at any point before the client re-initializes, the user may
issue the command "ipconfig /release," and then "ipconfig /renew" to re-
discover another DHCP server to receive an IP address.
