<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT 4.0 Server and Workstation Resource Kits include desktop
themes similar to the themes shipped in Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95,
including various screen savers. Certain screen savers allow the
configuration of "hot corners." If you try to set a "hot corner" you will
get the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   You must have the System Agent loaded in order for the mouse hot corners
   to be active.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The System Agent is included with the Windows 95 Plus! Pack. Windows NT
does not have a System Agent so the screen saver "hot corners" option is
not available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Screen Saver "hot corners" allows the screen saver to be automatically
activated when the mouse cursor is positioned within a certain corner of
the desktop. Within the Settings properties sheet for the selected screen
saver, the General description states, "The system agent must be active in
order for you to display the screen saver immediately by moving the mouse
pointer to a corner on the screen." If you proceed by clicking one of the
four corners to enable this option, the following error message is
displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   You must have the System Agent loaded in order for the mouse hot corners
   to be active.

</PRE>If you attempt to bring up the online help by pressing the F1 key or
selecting the "What's This" button (the button in the upper right of dialog
box with a "?") and clicking on the specific region for help, the following
Windows Help error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find the Plus!.HLP file. Do you want to try to find this file
   yourself?

</PRE>If you click No, an additional error message appears stating:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find the Plus!.HLP Help file. Check to see that the file exists
   on your disk. If it doesn't, you need to reinstall it.

</PRE>If you click Yes, you can search for this help file on the system. However,
this file is only included in Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95. If the file
is located (Windows 95 is also installed on the computer), you are able to
view the online help information for items within the Screen Saver
Properties tab. The reference to this associated help file will then be
added to the HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Help key for future reference
in case you select help on one of these same items in the future.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Resource Kit
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
