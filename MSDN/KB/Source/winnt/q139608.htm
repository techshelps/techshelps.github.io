The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 with Service Pack 2

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following article explains the network traffic that occurs when a
Windows NT Workstation logs on to a Windows NT Domain in a Windows Internet
Name Service (WINS) environment. It focuses on the NetBIOS names that get
registered during the bootup and logon processes.
<P>
<P><h2>SETUP</h2>
 
<P>
This information is based on a Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 with
Service Pack 2. The computer name of the workstation is NTWINSCLIENT, and
is a member of the NTWINSDOM domain. The user login name is NEWUSER. This
domain contains a single primary domain controller (PDC) and one Windows NT
Workstation. There is a WINS server on the network, but it is not a member
of this domain. The IP address of the workstation is xxx.57.9.54 and the IP
address of the PDC is xxx.57.11.179 where xxx represents any valid number
for an IP address.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
At the workstation, if you issue the command "NBTSTAT -n" (without the
quotation marks) at a command prompt, the following information appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Node IpAddress: [xxx.57.9.54] Scope Id: []

              NetBIOS Local Name Table

   Name                 Type        Status
   ---------------------------------------------
   NTWINSCLIENT   &lt;00&gt;  UNIQUE      Registered
   NTWINSDOM      &lt;00&gt;  GROUP       Registered
   NTWINSCLIENT   &lt;03&gt;  UNIQUE      Registered
   NTWINSCLIENT   &lt;20&gt;  UNIQUE      Registered
   NTWINSDOM      &lt;1E&gt;  GROUP       Registered
   NEWUSER        &lt;03&gt;  UNIQUE      Registered


</PRE>The following explains the relevant server message block (SMB), NetBIOS,
and NBT traffic during the bootup and logon processes as recorded with
Microsoft Network Monitor. It also shows items from the NBTSTAT -n command
being registered.

<OL><P><LI>The Windows NT Workstation boots up. This shows the registration
    request and reply for the unique computername of NTWINSCLIENT:
<P>
       Windows NT Workstation to the WINS Server:
<P>
<PRE>          NBT: NS: Registration req. for NTWINSCLIENT   &lt;00&gt;

       WINS Server to the Windows NT Workstation:

              NTWINSCLIENT   &lt;00&gt;, Success, Owner Addr. xxx.57.9.54

</PRE><P><LI>The Windows NT Workstation verifies and queries the WINS server for the
    name and IP address of a domain controller (DC) in its domain:
<P>
    Windows NT Workstation to the WINS Server:
<P>
<PRE>       NBT: NS: Registration req. for NTWINSDOM      &lt;00&gt;

    WINS Server to the NT Workstation:

       NBT: NS: Registration (Node Status) resp. for NTWINSDOM      &lt;00&gt;,

    Windows NT Workstation to the WINS Server:

       NBT: NS: Query req. for NTWINSDOM      &lt;1C&gt;

    WINS Server to the Windows NT Workstation:

       NBT: NS: Query (Node Status) resp. for NTWINSDOM      &lt;1C&gt;, Success

</PRE><P><LI>After obtaining the IP address, it broadcasts the logon request so the
    computername can exist in the domain:
<P>
    Windows NT Workstation Broadcast:
<P>
       NBT: DS: Type = 17 (DIRECT GROUP)
       SMB: C transact, File = \MAILSLOT\NET\NTLOGON
       NETLOGON: SAM LOGON request from client
<P>
    Windows NT Workstation Broadcast:
<P>
       ARP_RARP: ARP: Request, Target IP: xxx.57.11.179

<P><LI>When the DC responds to the broadcast, it gives the client the name of
    the server that can validate the computer name in the domain:
<P>
       Windows NT DC to the Windows NT Workstation:
<P>
<PRE>          ARP_RARP: ARP: Reply, Target IP: xxx.57.9.54 Target Hdwr Addr:

</PRE><P><LI>The Windows NT Workstation then begins the logon process of its
    computer name:
<P>
       Windows NT Workstation to the NT Domain Controller:
<P>
<PRE>          NBT: DS: Type = 17 (DIRECT GROUP)
          SMB: C transact, File = \MAILSLOT\NET\NTLOGON
          NETLOGON: SAM LOGON request from client

          SMB: C transact, File = \MAILSLOT\NET\GETDC209
          NETLOGON: SAM Response to SAM LOGON request

       Windows NT Workstation to the WINS Server:

          NBT: NS: Query req. for NTWINSPDC

       WINS Server to the Windows NT Workstation:

          NBT: NS: Query (Node Status) resp. for NTWINSPDC, Success

       Windows NT Workstation to the Windows NT DC:

          NBT: SS: Session Request, Dest: NTWINSPDC       , Source:
                                                 NTWINSCLIENT&lt;00&gt;, Len: 68

       Windows NT DC to the Windows NT Workstation:

          NBT: SS: Positive Session Response, Len: 0

</PRE><P><LI>The two machines (DC and workstation) then negotiate at what level of
    SMB they are going to communicate on:
<P>
       Windows NT Workstation to the Windows NT DC:
<P>
<PRE>          SMB: C negotiate, Dialect = NT LM 0.12

       Windows NT DC to the Windows NT Workstation:

          SMB: R negotiate, Dialect # = 7

</PRE><P><LI>The workstation connects to the IPC$ share on the DC so the computer
    name can be validated as existing on the domain:
<P>
       Windows NT Workstation to the Windows NT DC:
<P>
<PRE>          SMB: C session setup &amp; X, Username = , and C tree connect &amp; X,
              Share =\\NTWINSPDC\IPC$

       Windows NT DC to the Windows NT Workstation:

          SMB: R NT create &amp; X, FID = 0x800

          At this point Microsoft RPC traffic over SMBs occurs between the
          Windows NT DC and the Windows NT Workstation. This traffic is not
          shown because it does not pertain to the subject matter.

       Windows NT Workstation to the Windows NT DC:

          SMB: C close file, FID = 0x800

       Windows NT DC to the Windows NT Workstation:

       Windows NT Workstation to the Windows NT DC:

       Windows NT DC to the Windows NT Workstation:

          SMB: R NT create &amp; X, FID = 0x801

          At this point Microsoft RPC traffic over SMBs occurs between the
          Windows NT DC and the Windows NT Workstation. This traffic is not
          shown because it does not pertain to the subject matter.

          SMB: C transact, File = \MAILSLOT\BROWSE
          BROWSER: Host Announcement [0x01] NTWINSCLIENT

</PRE><P><LI>The Windows NT Workstation now requests to become a browser for the
    domain, because a.) there are no backup browsers in this two-computer
    domain, and b.) the Windows NT Workstation is capable of being a backup
    browser:
<P>

</PRE><P><LI>The user presses CTRL+ALT+DEL and logs into the domain. Because this
    user has never logged into this computer before, there is no cached
    information at the workstation. The workstation needs to contact the
    domain controller for validation:
