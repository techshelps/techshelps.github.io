<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to install, configure, and troubleshoot third-
party OEM network adapter drivers.
<P>
NOTE: This article contains information about using Windows NT 4.0 with
third-party products or configurations that have not been tested and are
not supported by Microsoft. If the steps described in this article do not
function properly, use a supported configuration or contact the
manufacturer of your third-party product for more information.
<P>
Windows NT 4.0 includes Microsoft-supported drivers for many network
adapters. The Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM also contains third-party drivers for
many other network adapters that may or may not be on the Windows NT 4.0
Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). These drivers are supported by the OEM,
not by Microsoft. You can locate these drivers in the following two
folders on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM:
<P>
<PRE>   Drvlib\Netcard\&lt;platform&gt;
   &lt;platform&gt;\Drvlib.nic

</PRE>where &lt;platform&gt; is your computer's processor type (Alpha, I386, MIPS, or
PPC).
<P>
Other Windows NT 4.0 network adapter drivers are created by OEMs. These
drivers may be available in any of the following ways:

<UL><LI>Included on a floppy disk or CD-ROM with a new network adapter.
<LI>Accessible from the Internet or the OEM's electronic bulletin board
   service (BBS).
<LI>By mail from the OEM.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This section discusses the following topics:

<UL><LI>Before installing the driver in Windows NT
<LI>General installation
<LI>Troubleshooting tips
<P>
</UL><h3>Before Installing the Driver in Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
Before installing the driver, verify that the network adapter is
configured properly by running any configuration or Setup program included
with the adapter. The configuration program may also include a diagnostic
test to verify that the hardware is working correctly.
<P>
If no configuration program is available for the network adapter, check
the documentation for the adapter to determine how to verify the adapter's
settings.
<P>
Configuration information you should note before installing the driver
includes the following:

<UL><LI>I/O port address setting
<LI>Interrupt request (IRQ) line
<LI>Direct memory access (DMA) channel
<LI>Transceiver type
<LI>Bus type
<P>
</UL>In addition, there may be settings for the Windows NT driver that are
specific to your network adapter. You may need to consult the
documentation for your adapter.
<P>
<P><h3>General Installation</h3>
 
<P>
To install the network adapter driver, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>On the Adapters tab, click Add.

<P><LI>Click Have Disk.

<P><LI>Type the path to the third-party network adapter driver files in the
   Insert Disk box. If the driver files are on a floppy disk, verify that
   the disk is inserted in the floppy disk drive before proceeding. Click
   OK.

<P><LI>Click the network adapter driver for your network card in the Select
   OEM Option box, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Choose the configuration settings for your network adapter, and then
   click OK.

<P><LI>Choose or type any other necessary network configuration options on
   the Identification, Services, and Protocols tabs, and then click Close.

<P><LI>If any additional network software options are installed, you may be
   prompted for additional information about these settings.

<P><LI>Click Yes when you are prompted to restart your computer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Troubleshooting Tips</h3>
 
<P>
If Windows NT does not detect or initialize the network adapter, you may
receive the following error message after Windows NT starts:
<P>
<PRE>   At least one service or driver failed during system startup. Use Event
   Viewer to examine the event log for details.

</PRE></OL>Event Viewer may display the following information:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 7000
   The &lt;your network adapter&gt; Driver service failed to start due to the
   following error: A device attached to the system is not functioning.

</PRE>To troubleshoot this problem, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the I/O address and IRQ line that you specified for the
   network adapter is correct. You may need to run the Setup program
   for the adapter, or you may need to consult the network adapter's
   documentation to check these settings. If the I/O address or IRQ line
   is different from the value you specified when you installed the driver
   in Windows NT, change the value to match the settings you specified in
   Windows NT.

<P><LI>Verify that the I/O address and IRQ line being used by the network
   adapter are not being used by any other device in your computer.

<P><LI>Verify that the network adapter passes all diagnostic tests included
   with the Setup program. If the network adapter fails the diagnostic
   tests, it does not function correctly in Windows NT.
<P>
</OL>If the adapter passes all of the diagnostic tests, you have verified that
its configuration matches the configuration specified in Windows NT, and
the settings cause no conflict with any other hardware installed in your
computer, there could be a problem with your Windows NT network
configuration.
<P>
If you have made several attempts to configure the network adapter or you
had another network adapter installed before the adapter you are currently
installing, it may be necessary to restore the Windows NT network
configuration to the default settings and then reinstall the network
adapter driver. To do so, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>Click the network adapter on the Select Adapters tab, and then click
   Remove.

<P><LI>Click Close, and then click Yes when you are prompted to restart your
   computer.

<P><LI>Reinstall the network adapter driver.
<P>
</OL>If these steps do not resolve the problem, there may be settings in the
registry that are not removed when the adapter is uninstalled. Repeat
steps 1-3 above, and then before step 4, follow the procedures in the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q147797.htm">Q147797</A></B>
   TITLE     : Manually Removing Network Adapter Entries from the Registry

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q146333.htm">Q146333</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Remove Network Adapters from the Registry

</PRE></OL>If the network adapter still does not work, contact the manufacturer of
the network adapter for an updated driver.
