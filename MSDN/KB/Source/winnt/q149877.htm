<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Intel-based computers rely on the system BIOS to load and execute bootstrap
code. The BIOS bootstrap routine generates an int 0x19 which loads the
first sector of the floppy or hard disk (0:0:1 in CHS) in memory at segment
address 0000:7C00H. The first physical sector is called the master boot
record (MBR) and contains the primary bootstrap loader code.
<P>
After loading sector zero, the BIOS checks that the last two bytes of that
sector are 55AA as seen on the disk. This 55AA is called a boot record
signature and is kind of like an EOF when the sector is read. This is
something that the BIOS requires when booting. If the boot record signature
is not present, you will probably get a BIOS-dependent message:
<P>
<PRE>  Boot Record Signature AA55 Not Found, xxyy Found

</PRE>Alternately, the message
<P>
<PRE>       Non-System or Non-Bootable Disk

</PRE>or the message
<P>
<PRE>       Strike f1 to retry boot

</PRE>will appear, or the system will stop responding.
<P>
<P>
If Windows NT is installed on a logical drive in an extended partition,
after the BOOT MENU choice and NTDETECT runs, this error message will
appear:
<P>
 
OS Loader 4.0
Boot record Signature AA55 Not Found, xxyy Found.
<P>
Windows NT could not start because of a computer disk hardware
configuration problem. Could not read from the selected boot disk.
Check boot path and disk hardware.
<P>
Please check the Windows NT Documentation about hardware disk
Configuration and your hardware reference manuals for additional
information.
 
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The MBR consists of boot code that is used by the system BIOS to read the
partition table. From data contained in the partition table, the MBR can
determine which partition is set to be bootable (active) and also the
starting sector of that partition. Once that location is determined , the
BIOS jumps to that sector and begins the next phase of the boot process by
executing additional code that is operating-system specific.
<P>
If the only thing wrong with sector zero was that the last two bytes are
not 55AA, this could easily be fixed with a disk editor such as Norton
Diskedit. However, this message is usually indicative of something
overwriting or destroying the entire boot sector (sector zero) including
the partition table entries.
<P>
<P>
When you install Windows NT on a logical drive in an extended partition -
OSLOADER needs to "walk the extended partition table" through BIOS calls in
order to get to the partition you have Windows NT installed in.  Each of
these logical drives are addressed in a "daisy chain" of partition tables.
Each sector that contains a partition table entry MUST end with a 55AA as
the last 2 bytes in the sector.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is probably caused by a virus or a hardware malfunction. The
best way to determine how to recover is to use a disk editor to see if the
partition table entries are still intact. Each sector occupies 512 bytes.
The first 446 bytes of sector zero contain the MBR boot code followed by
the partition table entries, and ends with 55AA. If the partition table
entries are still intact at offsets 1BE through 1FD, manually record their
values, then write 55AA starting at offset 1FE. Once the signature 55AA is
written the MBR boot code can be regenerated by using the Fdisk.exe program
from MS-DOS version 5.0 or later.
<P>
To do this, run the following:
<P>
<PRE>   FDISK /MBR

</PRE>WARNING: This process will repair the bootstrap code and the 55AA signature
by rewriting sector zero but will also overwrite the partition table
entries with all zeros, rendering your logical drives useless (unless, that
is, the 55AA signature is manually entered using a disk editor prior to
your performing the FDISK /MBR).
<P>
<P>
If the partition table entries are not intact or were overwritten with
unreadable characters, the problem is more involved and entails locating
the master boot sector (MBS) for each partition and manually rebuilding the
partition table entries. This process is beyond the scope of this article.
<P>
To speed recover from future MBR corruption, use the Windows
NT 4.0 Resource Kit utility Disksave.exe to save a copy of the MBR to a
floppy disk. This can be used if needed at some future date to restore the
MBR using Disksave.exe.
<P>
In the case where Windows NT is installed on a logical drive in an extended
partition, you will need a disk editing utility like Norton Diskedit to
examine each sector containing an extended partition logical drive entry to
make sure it ends with a 55AA. This process is beyond the scope of this
article.
