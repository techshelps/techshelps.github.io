The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A hypen (minus sign) is substituted whenever you use a percent sign, pound
sign, or underscore in a computer name during an initial installation of
Windows NT. For example, %MYNAME, MYNAME#1, and MYNAME_1 become,
respectively, -MYNAME, MYNAME-1, and MYNAME-1.
<P>
It is not possible to add a percent sign, pound sign, or underscore into
the DNS Host Name even though the Server Installation Guide does not list
them as invalid characters.
<P>
If you try to insert an invalid character, the following error is
displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   The parameter is incorrect.

</PRE>Another symptom occurs when you attempt to connect to a newly created Web
server with an invalid character in the computer name. You are unable to
connect to HTTP://SERVER#1, but you can connect to HTTP://SERVER-1.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The cause of this error message is given in RFC 952, which states:
<P>
<PRE>   A "name" (Net, Host, Gateway, or Domain name) is a text string up
   to 24 characters drawn from the alphabet (A-Z), digits (0-9), minus
   sign (-), and period (.). Note that periods are only allowed when
   they serve to delimit components of "domain style names". (See
   RFC-921, "Domain Name System Implementation Schedule", for
   background). No blank or space characters are permitted as part of a
   name. No distinction is made between upper and lower case. The first
   character must be an alpha character. The last character must not be
   a minus sign or period. A host which serves as a GATEWAY should have
   "-GATEWAY" or "-GW" as part of its name. Hosts which do not serve as
   Internet gateways should not use "-GATEWAY" and "-GW" as part of
   their names. A host which is a TAC should have "-TAC" as the last
   part of its host name, if it is a DoD host. Single character names
   or nicknames are not allowed.

      DOD INTERNET HOST TABLE SPECIFICATION:
      --------------------------------------
      This RFC is the official specification of the format of the Internet
      Host Table. This edition of the specification includes minor
      revisions to RFC-810 which brings it up to date. Distribution of this
      memo is unlimited.

</PRE>By design, the Microsoft Windows NT DNS Hosts Configuration utility
replaces all invalid characters in the DNS host name found in the NetBIOS
computer name with a hyphen. If you want your NetBIOS and DNS host names to
match, you must use the DNS naming standard outlined in RFC 952 when
creating your NetBIOS computer name.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In the DNS Configuration dialog box for the TCP/IP Protocol in Control
Panel Network, change the host name to a valid string of characters.
