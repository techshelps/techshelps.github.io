The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1

<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following error message appears when you try to switch to your public
folders window from your private folders window in Microsoft Mail:
<P>
<PRE>   There was an error switching between private and shared folders.
   Check your message file and your network connection to the postoffice.

</PRE>The following error appears when you try to open a shared folder in the
shared folders window:
<P>
<PRE>   The action cannot be completed because that shared folder is busy.
   Try performing the action again later. If the problem persists,
   contact your administrator.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You do not have the appropriate permissions to the WGPO\FOLDERS\PUB
directory or the files in it.
<P>
Mail requires that you assign Full Control permission to all Mail users for
the workgroup postoffice directory (WGPO by default) and all of its
subdirectories and files. If you do not have sufficient directory
permission to the PUB subdirectory, or the files in it, Mail displays only
your private folders window when you start Mail (if that window was open
the last time you quit Mail). If you had only your shared folder window
open the last time you quit Mail, Mail displays only your outbox.
<P>
To open a new private folders window, choose New Window from the Window
menu. If you try to switch to your shared folders window before you
correctly set the directory permissions, the first error referenced above
appears.
<P>
If directory permissions are revoked while you are in Mail, and you have
your shared folders window open, the second error message referenced above
appears when you try to open one of the shared folders.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, run File Manager on the workgroup postoffice
server and:

<OL><P><LI>Select the WGPO\FOLDERS\PUB subdirectory.

<P><LI>From the Security menu, choose Permissions.

<P><LI>Add your user account or a group to which you belong (for example,
   Mailusers). The account of group must have the Full Control permission.
   Make sure you select "Replace Permissions on Existing Files." Verify
   that your user account or group does not currently have the No Access
   permission assigned to that directory.

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>You should now be able to access your shared folders.
