<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Using Domain Name System (DNS) to resolve multihomed clients can fail
even if one of the IP addresses returned by DNS is correct.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a Windows NT 4.0 client uses DNS to resolve a name of a machine that
is defined with multiple IP addresses, the application may fail if one or
more of the IP addresses mapped to the name do not exist.
<P>
Most HOST utilities (FTP, Telnet, and so forth) make a separate request to
DNS each time an attempt is made to resolve the name. The round robin
feature of DNS enables DNS to return the IP addresses of the name in a
different order each time. The application will use the first IP address of
the list each time and attempt to make a connection using that IP address.
<P>
NetBT connectivity handles the responses differently. When the first query
is made through DNS, the name is then cached for the time defined as the
CacheTimeout (10 minutes). The request is made for the first entry in the
returned list of IP addresses. Any attempts made within 10 minutes of the
first are then addressed through the cache first and DNS will not be used.
Any additional requests made after the cache is empty will (more likely)
then also receive the response in a new order.
<P>
Microsoft Internet Explorer works differently in that it will go through
each IP address returned until either a response is received or all IP
addresses are attempted. The responsibility of performing in this manner
lies in the application. It is the responsibility of the resolver to return
the addresses from DNS, not define the manner in which the application uses
the addresses.
