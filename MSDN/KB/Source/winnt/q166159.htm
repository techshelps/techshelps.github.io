The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you connect from a multihomed computer running Windows NT to another
computer, the local source IP address used may not be optimal. If the
multihomed system is attached to two different (disjoint) networks, and the
target system is on only one of the networks, there may be a delay in
establishing the connection.
<P>
This behavior only occurs on NetBIOS over TCP/IP sessions; therefore, this
information does not apply to Windows Sockets applications such as Web
browsers.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT 4.0 (and earlier) redirector used the following logic to
establish a NetBIOS session:

<UL><LI>Place a call to the destination name on all bound transports, in the
   order they are bound.

<LI>Wait for the "primary" (first-bound) transport to complete, and if it
   was successful in reaching the target, set up a session on it and
   disconnect (cancel) the other calls.
<P>
</UL>In the case of a computer that is multihomed on two connected (by a router)
networks, if the target system is on only one of those networks, there are
two paths to the target system. In this case, the call succeeds on both
paths, and the "primary" transport (for example, the local source IP
address associated with that binding of NetBT) is the chosen one. The other
call is cancelled. This means that the less optimal path (through the
router) may win out over the more optimal (direct) path. In this case,
packets sent from the multihomed computer are internally routed to the
directly connected subnet (because the route table shows a direct route to
it), but packets sent in response from the target system traverse the
router. This scenario can be confusing to troubleshoot.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
A Windows NT redirector has been produced that allows a new configurable
behavior, accepting the first transport to complete a call, and immediately
canceling the calls on the others. A new version of NetBT that supports
better handling of multiple calls and cancels is also available.
<P>
To take advantage of this improvement, a registry parameter must be added
as follows:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rdr\Parameters

   Value Name: IgnoreBindingOrder
   Value type: REG_DWORD
   Default: 0

   Setting this value to "1" causes the redirector to accept the first
   transport to complete a call, rather than waiting for success or failure
   on the "primary" transport.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S.
Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following
word
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem and hotfix do not apply to Windows Sockets-based connections.
When a Windows Sockets application places a call from a multi-homed host
the best local source address is chosen automatically (using the route
table), unless the application specifies otherwise by choosing a local IP
address to use in the bind() call.
