The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The article contains Registry entries for network services, Part 4.
These subgroups are included:

<UL><LI>EventLog Service
<LI>(NBF) NetBEUI Transport
<P>
</UL>For a listing of the contents of network services entries articles
1-8, see "Network Services Entries, Part 1."
<P>
<P><h2>EventLog Service Entries</h2>
 
<P>
The Services subkey for EventLog contains at least three subkeys for
the three types of logs-Application, Security, and System. These
Logfile subkeys contain subkeys that define the location of the
related event message file and the supported types of events, as
follows:

<UL><LI>The Application key contains subkeys for installed applications and
   services that write to the Application event log.

<LI>The Security key contains subkeys for each of the security subsystem
   components.

<LI>The System key contains subkeys for device drivers.
<P>
</UL>Each of the three Logfile subkeys for the EventLog service can contain
the value entries described in this section. The Registry path for
these entries is the following, where logfile is System, Application,
or Security.
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
        \Eventlog\application

</PRE>These entries are described for informational purposes only. This
information is usually maintained by Event Viewer. New keys under the
Application key can only be added in meaningful ways by using the
Win32 Registry APIs.
<P>
<PRE>File     REG_SZ     Path and filename
   Specifies the fully qualified path name of the file for this log.
   This value can be set in Event Viewer. Default:
   \SystemRoot\system32\config\filename

MaxSize     REG_DWORD     Number in kilobytes
   Specifies the maximum size of the log file. This value can be set
   using the Event Viewer. Default: 512

Retention     REG_DWORD     Number of seconds
   Specifies that records that are newer than this value will not be
   overwritten. This is what causes a log full event. This value can
   be set using the Event Viewer. Default: 604800 (7 days)

Sources     REG_MULTI_SZ     Names of source applications
   Specifies the applications, services, or groups of applications
   that write events to this log. Each source is a subkey of the
   Logfile key. Default: None. This value is dynamically maintained by
   the EventLog service.

   The Source subkeys under a Logfile key are created by the
   applications that write events in the related event log. These
   subkeys contain information specific to the source of the event
   under the following types of value entries.

EventMessageFile      REG_EXPAND_SZ     Filename
   Specifies the path and filename for the event identifier message
   file.

CategoryMessageFile     REG_EXPAND_SZ     Filename
   Specifies the path and filename for the category message file. The
   category and event identifier message strings may be in the same
   file.

CategoryCount     REG_DWORD     Number
   Specifies the number of categories supported.

TypesSupported     REG_DWORD     Number
   Specifies a bitmask of supported types.

</PRE><h2>NBF (NetBEUI) Transport Entries</h2>
 
<P>
The startup parameters for the NetBEUI (NBF) transport are found under
the following subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Services\NBF\Parameters

</PRE>NOTE: The parameters that control network bindings for this service
are described in the section "NetRules Subkey" in the article "Network
Adapter Cards Entries, Part 1." You should set the Export and Bind
parameters by using the Network application in Control Panel.
<P>
The Initxxx entries for NBF define the initial allocation and the size
of free memory for items. The Maxxxx entries define the upper limits.
Within these ranges, the system autotunes performance. By default, the
NBF service uses all the resources necessary to handle client
requests, and when it is not actively working, it doesn't use many
resources. Set Initxxx values to control initial allocation, which can
make the system a little faster when you know a server will be busy.
Set the Maxxxx values to control limits when you don't want the server
to be too busy or to use too much memory for networking.
<P>
With Registry Editor, you can modify the following startup parameters
for the NBF transport:
<P>
<PRE>AddNameQueryRetries     REG_DWORD     Number
   Specifies the number of times that NBF will retry sending
   ADD_NAME_QUERY and ADD_GROUP_NAME_QUERY frames. Adjust this
   parameter only if NBF is registering addresses on a network that
   drops many packets. Default: 3

AddNameQueryTimeout     REG_DWORD    100-nanosecond units
   Specifies the time-out between NBF sending successive
   ADD_NAME_QUERY and ADD_GROUP_NAME_QUERY frames. Adjust this
   parameter only if NBF is registering addresses on a network with
   slow computers or over a slow network. Default: 5000000

GeneralRetries     REG_DWORD     Number
   Specifies the number of times that NBF will retry sending
   STATUS_QUERY and FIND_NAME frames. Adjust this parameter only if
   NBF is operating on a network that drops many packets. Default: 3

DefaultT1Timeout     REG_DWORD     100-nanosecond units
   Specifies the initial value for the T1 timeout. T1 controls the
   time that NBF waits for a response after sending a logical link
   control (LLC) poll packet before resending it. Adjust this
   parameter only if NBF will be connecting over slow networks or to
   slow remote computers (although NBF does adapt). Default: 6000000
   (600 milliseconds)

GeneralTimeout     REG_DWORD     100-nanosecond units
   Specifies the time-out between NBF sending successive STATUS_QUERY
   and FIND_NAME requests. Adjust this parameter only if NBF is
   operating on a network with slow computers or over a slow network.
   Default: 5000000

DefaultT2Timeout     REG_DWORD    100-nanosecond units
   Specifies the initial value for the T2 timeout. T2 controls the
   time that NBF can wait after receiving an LLC poll packet before
   responding. It must be much less than T1; one-half or less is a
   good general rule. Adjust this parameter only if NBF will be
   connecting over slow networks or to slow remote computers. Default:
   1500000 (150 milliseconds)

DefaultTiTimeout     REG_DWORD     100-nanosecond units
   Specifies the initial value for the Ti timeout. Ti is the
   inactivity timer. When it expires, NBF sends an LLC poll packet to
   ensure that the link is still active. Adjust this parameter only if
   NBF is connecting over networks with unusual reliability
   characteristics, or over slow networks or to slow computers.
   Default: 300000000 (30 seconds)

InitAddresses     REG_DWORD     1 or higher; 0 = no limit
   Specifies the number of initial addresses to allocate within any
   memory limits that might be imposed on NBF. Addresses correspond to
   NetBIOS names. An address is for the actual name, and an address
   file is for a TDI (Transport Driver Interface) client using that
   name; so usually you have the same number, but if two users open
   the same address, that is two address files but only one address.

   Set this parameter if you know that a large number of addresses are
   needed. Otherwise, the system automatically allocates space for
   addresses as needed. Default: 0 (no limit)

InitAddressFiles     REG_DWORD     1 or higher; 0 = no limit
   Specifies the number of initial address files to allocate within
   any memory limits that might imposed on NBF. Set this parameter if
   you know that a large number of address files are needed.
   Otherwise, the system automatically allocates space for address
   files as needed. Default: 0 (no limit)

InitConnections     REG_DWORD     1 or higher; 0 = no limit
   Specifies the number of initial connections (NetBIOS sessions) to
   allocate within any memory limits that might imposed on NBF. Set
   this parameter if you know that a large number of connections are
   needed. Otherwise, the system automatically allocates space for
   connections as needed. Default: 1

InitLinks     REG_DWORD     1 or higher; 0 = no limit

   Specifies the number of initial LLC links to allocate within any
   memory limits that might be imposed on NBF. Typically, you have one
   connection per LLC link to another network adapter card, because
   the redirector puts all links to a computer into one connection.
   However, you may have more if two computers are communicating with
   each other or if a NetBIOS application is running. Set this
   parameter if you know that a large number of links are needed.
   Otherwise, the system automatically allocates space for links as
   needed. Default: 2

InitReceiveBuffers     REG_DWORD     1 or higher; 0 = no limit
   Specifies the number of initial receive buffers to allocate.
   Receive buffers are used by NBF when it calls NDIS TransferData for
   received datagrams. Usually, this value is allocated as needed, but
   you can use this parameter to preallocate memory if you know a
   large number of datagram frames will be received. Default: 5

InitReceivePackets     REG_DWORD     1 or higher; 0 = no limit
   Specifies the number of initial receive packets to allocate.
   Receive packets are used by NBF when it calls NDIS TransferData for
   received data. Usually, this value is allocated as needed, but you
   can use this parameter to preallocate memory if you know a large
   number of UI frames will be received. Default: 10

InitRequests     REG_DWORD     1 or higher; 0 = no limit
   Specifies the number of initial requests to allocate within any
   memory limits that might be imposed on NBF. Requests are used for
   in-progress connect requests, remote adapter status requests, find
   name requests, and so on. Set this parameter if you know that a
   large number of requests are needed. Otherwise, the system
   automatically allocates space for requests as needed. Default: 5

InitSendPackets     REG_DWORD     1 or higher; 0 = no limit
   Specifies the number of initial send packets to allocate. Send
   packets are used by NBF whenever it sends connection-oriented data
   on behalf of a client. Usually, this value is allocated as needed,
   but you can use this parameter to preallocate memory if you know a
   large number of data frames are needed or if you see a lot of "send
   packets exhausted" messages when using Performance Monitor.
   Default: 30

InitUIFrames     REG_DWORD     1 or higher; 0 = no limit
   Specifies the number of initial UI frames to allocate. UI frames
   are used by NBF to establish connections and for connectionless
   services such as datagrams. Usually, this value is allocated as
   needed, but you can use this parameter to preallocate memory if you
   know a large number of UI frames are needed. Default: 5

LLCMaxWindowSize     REG_DWORD     Number of frames
   Specifies the number of LLC I frames that NBF can send before
   polling and waiting for a response from the remote. Adjust this
   parameter only if NBF is communicating over a network whose
   reliability often changes suddenly. Default: 10

LLCRetries     REG_DWORD     1 or higher; 0 = no limit
   Specifies the number of times that NBF will retry polling a remote
   workstation after receiving a T1 timeout. After this many retries,
   NBF closes the link. Adjust this parameter only if NBF is
   connecting over networks with unusual reliability characteristics.
   Default: 8

MaxAddresses     REG_DWORD     1 or higher; 0 = no limit
   Specifies the maximum number of addresses that NBF allocates within
   any memory limits that might be imposed on NBF. Addresses are NetBIOS
   names that are registered on the network by NBF. An address is for
   the actual name, and an address file is for a TDI client using that
   name. Use this optional parameter to fine-tune use of NBF memory.
   Typically this parameter is used to control address resources with
   an unlimited NBF. Default: 0 (no limit)

MaxAddressFiles     REG_DWORD     1 or higher; 0 = no limit
   Specifies maximum number of address files that NBF allocates within
   any memory limits that might be imposed on NBF. Each address file
   corresponds to a client opening an address.

   Use this optional parameter to fine-tune use of NBF memory.
   Typically this parameter is used to control address files with an
   unlimited NBF. Default: 0 (no limit)

MaxConnections     REG_DWORD     1 or higher; 0 = no limit
   Specifies the maximum number of connections that NBF allocates
   within any memory limits that might imposed on NBF. Connections are
   established between NBF clients and similar entities on remote
   computers.

   Use this optional parameter to fine-tune use of NBF memory.
   Typically this parameter is used to control connection resources
   with an unlimited NBF. Default: 0 (no limit)

MaximumIncomingFrames     REG_DWORD    1 or higher; 0 = off
   Used in some cases to control how many incoming frames NBF will
   receive before it sends an acknowledgment to a remote machine. In
   general, NBF automatically senses when to sends acknowledgments,
   however when communicating with some Microsoft LAN Manager or Lan
   Server remote computers configured with a very low value for
   maxout, this parameter can be set to an equal or lower value to
   improve network performance. (This parameter corresponds roughly to
   the Microsoft LAN Manager maxin parameter.) A value of 0 turns off
   this hint, causing NBF to revert to usual behavior. For
   communication with most all remotes, this parameter isn't used.
   Default: 2

MaxLinks     REG_DWORD     1 or higher; 0 = no limit
   Specifies the maximum number of links that NBF allocates within any
   memory limits that might be imposed on NBF. Links are established
   for every remote adapter to which NBF communicates. Use this
   optional parameter to fine-tune use of NBF memory. Typically this
   parameter is used to control link resources with an unlimited NBF.
   Default: 0 (no limit)

MaxRequests     REG_DWORD     1 or higher; 0 = no limit
   Specifies the maximum number of requests that NBF allocates within
   any memory limits that might be imposed on NBF. Requests are used
   by NBF to control send, receive, connect, and listen operations.

   Use this optional parameter to fine-tune use of NBF memory.
   Typically this parameter is used to control request resources with
   an unlimited NBF. Default: 0 (no limit)

NameQueryRetries     REG_DWORD     Number
   Specifies the number of times that NBF will retry sending
   NAME_QUERY frames. Adjust this parameter only if NBF is connecting
   to computers over a network that drops many packets. Default: 3

NameQueryTimeout     REG_DWORD     100-nanosecond units
   Specifies the time-out between NBF sending successive NAME_QUERY
   frames. Adjust this parameter only if NBF is connecting to slow
   computers or over a slow network. Default: 5000000

QueryWithoutSourceRouting     REG_DWORD     0 or 1
   When you are using NBF over a Token Ring driver, this parameter
   instructs NBF to send half the queries without including source
   routing information when connecting to a remote computer. This
   supports bridging hardware that cannot forward frames that contain
   source routing information. Default: 0 (false)

UseDixOverEthernet     REG_DWORD     0 or 1
   Specifies whether NBF should use DIX encoding when bound to an
   Ethernet MAC. When using DIX encoding is enabled, NBF cannot talk
   to computers that use the standard IEEE 802.3 encoding. Default: 0
   (false)

WanNameQueryRetries     REG_DWORD     Number
   Specifies the number of times that NBF will retry sending
   NAME_QUERY frames when connecting with RAS. Adjust this parameter
   only if NBF is connecting to computers over a network that drops
   many packets. Default: 5
