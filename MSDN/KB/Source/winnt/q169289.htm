<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a standard protocol defined
by RFC 1541 (which is superceded by RFC 2131) that allows a server to
dynamically distribute IP addressing and configuration information to
clients. Normally the DHCP server provides the client with at least this
basic information:

<UL><LI>IP Address
<LI>Subnet Mask
<LI>Default Gateway
<P>
</UL>Other information can be provided as well, such as Domain Name Service
(DNS) server addresses and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) server
addresses. The system administrator configures the DHCP server with the
options that are parsed out to the client.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following Microsoft products provide DHCP client functionality:

<UL><LI>Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Network Client version 3.0 for MS-DOS
<LI>Microsoft LAN Manager Client version 2.2c for MS-DOS
<LI>Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups versions 3.11, 3.11a,
   and 3.11b
<P>
</UL>Different DHCP clients support different options that they can receive
from the DHCP server. For information on specific DHCP options supported
by Microsoft DHCP clients, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : DHCP Options Supported by Clients

</PRE>The following Microsoft server operating systems provide DHCP server
functionality:

<UL><LI>Windows NT Server version 3.5
<LI>Windows NT Server version 3.51
<LI>Windows NT Server version 4.0
<P>
</UL>When a client is initialized for the first time after it is configured to
receive DHCP information, it initiates a conversation with the server.
<P>
Below is a summary table of the conversation between client and server,
which is followed by a packet-level description of the process:
<P>
<PRE>   Source     Dest        Source     Dest              Packet
   MAC addr   MAC addr    IP addr    IP addr           Description
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   Client     Broadcast   0.0.0.0    255.255.255.255   DHCP Discover
   DHCPsrvr   Broadcast   DHCPsrvr   255.255.255.255   DHCP Offer
   Client     Broadcast   0.0.0.0    255.255.255.255   DHCP Request
   DHCPsrvr   Broadcast   DHCPsrvr   255.255.255.255   DHCP ACK

</PRE>The detailed conversation between DHCP client and DHCP server is as
follows:
<P>
DHCPDISCOVER
<P>
The client sends a DHCPDISCOVER packet. The following is an excerpt from a
network monitor capture showing the IP and DHCP potions of a DHCPDISCOVER
packet. In the IP section, you can see the Destination address is
255.255.255.255 and the Source address is 0.0.0.0. The DHCP section
identifies the packet as a Discover packet and identifies the client in
two places using the physical address of the network card. Note the values
in the CHADDR field and the DHCP: Client Identifier field are identical.

</PRE>DHCPOFFER
<P>
The DHCP server responds by sending a DHCPOFFER packet. In the IP section
of the capture excerpt below, the Source address is now the DHCP server IP
address, and the Destination address is the broadcast address
255.255.255.255. The DHCP section identifies the packet as an Offer. The
YIADDR field is populated with the IP address the server is offering the
client. Note the CHADDR field still contains the physical address of the
requesting client. Also, we see in the DHCP Option Field section the
various options being sent by the server along with the IP address. In
this case the server is sending the Subnet Mask, Default Gateway (Router),
Lease Time, WINS server address (NetBIOS Name Service), and the NetBIOS
Node Type.

        DHCP: End of this option field

</PRE>DHCPREQUEST
<P>
The client responds to the DHCPOFFER by sending a DHCPREQUEST. In the IP
section of the capture below, the Source address of the client is still
0.0.0.0 and the Destination for the packet is still 255.255.255.255. The
client retains 0.0.0.0 because the client hasn't received verification
from the server that it's okay to start using the address offered. The
Destination is still broadcast, because more than one DHCP server may have
responded and may be holding a reservation for an Offer made to the
client. This lets those other DHCP servers know they can release their
offered addresses and return them to their available pools. The DHCP
section identifies the packet as a Request and verifies the offered
address using the DHCP: Requested Address field. The DHCP: Server
Identifier field shows the IP address of the DHCP server offering the
lease.

</PRE>DHCPACK
<P>
The DHCP server responds to the DHCPREQUEST with a DHCPACK, thus
completing the initialization cycle. The Source address is the DHCP server
IP address, and the Destination address is still 255.255.255.255. The
YIADDR field contains the client's address, and the CHADDR and DHCP:
Client Identifier fields are the physical address of the network card in
the requesting client. The DHCP Option section identifies the packet as an
ACK.

</PRE>If the client has previously had a DHCP assigned IP address and it is
restarted, the client will specifically request the previously leased IP
address in a special DHCPREQUEST packet. The Source address is 0.0.0.0 and
the Destination is the broadcast address 255.255.255.255. Microsoft
clients will populate the DHCP Option Field DHCP: Requested Address with
the previously assigned address. Strictly RFC compliant clients will
populate the CIADDR Field with the address requested. The Microsoft DHCP
server will accept either.

</PRE>At this point, the server may or may not respond. The behavior of the
Windows NT DHCP server depends on the version of the operating system
being used as well as other factors such as superscoping. If the server
determines that the client can still use the address, it will either
remain silent or ACK the DHCPREQUEST. If the server determines that the
client cannot have the address, it will send a NACK.

</PRE>DHCP information obtained by the client from a DHCP server will have a
lease time associated with it. The lease time defines how long the client
can use the DHCP-assigned information. When the lease reaches certain
milestones, the client will attempt to renew its DHCP information.
<P>
To view IP information on a Windows NT or Windows for Workgroups client,
use the IPCONFIG utility. If the client is Windows 95, use WINIPCFG.

<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about DHCP, see RFC1541 and RFC2131. RFCs may be
obtained via the Internet as follows:
<P>
Paper copies of all RFCs are available from the NIC, either individually
or on a subscription basis (for more information, contact
NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL). Online copies are available via FTP or Kermit from
NIC.DDN.MIL as rfc/rfc####.txt or rfc/rfc####.PS (#### is the RFC number
without leading
zeros).
<P>
Additionally, RFCs may be requested through electronic mail from the
automated NIC mail server by sending a message to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL with
a subject line of "rfc ####" for text versions or a subject line of "rfc
####.PS" for PostScript versions. To obtain the RFC index, the subject
line of your message should read "rfc index".
