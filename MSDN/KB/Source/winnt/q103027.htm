The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system, version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The uninterruptible power supply (UPS) service in Windows NT has an
unexpected behavior in the user interface. If the Remote UPS Shutdown
check box is not selected, the signal level option buttons are still
available. This article describes how and why this unusual behavior is
required.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The UPS service is started from the Control Panel. It is used to
configure desired options and operation of the UPS hardware. You can
enable the service by selecting the "Uninterruptible Power Supply is
installed on:" check box.
<P>
The Remote UPS Shutdown configuration option allows the Windows NT
system to tell the UPS to turn off. This is done when Windows NT is
gracefully shutting down.
<P>
If the Remote UPS Shutdown check box is selected, this indicates that
the UPS device supports this functionality; the appropriate signal
level must then be selected to indicate how it works.
<P>
If the Remote UPS Shutdown check box is clear (not selected), the
signal level option buttons are still available. The expected behavior
is that if the option is disabled, the option buttons would be
unavailable; but this is not the case. If the Remote UPS Shutdown
check box is clear and the signal level option buttons are available,
there are two possibilities:

<UL><LI>The UPS device does not support this functionality. Therefore, it
   doesn't matter what the signal level option buttons are set to.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The UPS device does support this functionality, but you do not want to
   use it.
<P>
   In this case, you still need set the signal level option button that
   the UPS expects so that the UPS does not work incorrectly. Even if you
   do not want to use this feature, the UPS is still going to interpret
   the signals on this line. If it receives a certain signal, it will
   shut itself down.
<P>
</UL>Previously, if you did not want to use this feature on your UPS, the
default value assumed for the signal would (for 50 percent of UPS's)
result in the UPS device shutting itself off as soon as the power
failed, which is not desirable.
<P>
