The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Windows NT on a computer that has a NetFlex32 card and
more than 16 MB of physically memory, Setup may not be able to start the
network. At the network settings box during the graphical user interface
(GUI) portion of Setup, the following error may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Network could not start because dependency services failed to start.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error is caused by a problem with the Netflex32 card and the Windows
NT hardware abstraction layer (HAL) that loads during setup; the HAL to
fails to allocate enough memory to start the services.
<P>
If the computer is the first on the network, and going to be a primary
domain controller (PDC), you can continue installing Windows NT; the card
will work properly when machine is rebooted. If the computer is going to be
a backup domain controller (BDC), and must talk to the PDC to finish
installing, Setup will not complete successfully.
<P>
This problem has been attributed to Compaq's NetFlex32 driver.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, either install Windows NT over the network, or
bring the machine down to 16 MB of RAM. This will allow the services to
install properly and finish installation. Once the machine is running
Windows NT, the RAM can be re-installed.
<P>
Compaq has verified this to be a problem with the Netflex32 driver and
should have a fix in Compaq Support Software Diskette (SSD) version 1.14 or
later.
