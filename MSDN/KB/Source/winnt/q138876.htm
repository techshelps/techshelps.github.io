<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information in this article details changes and updates contained in

1.16. The information for this article was taken directly from the
NTREADME.HLP file found on the SSD.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The 1.16 release of the Compaq Support Software Diskette for
Windows NT 3.5x (NT SSD) contains the following new features and
maintenance modifications:
<P>
New Features in Compaq NT SSD Version 1.16 Pass B
<P>
<P><h3>Compaq On-Line Recovery Server Option</h3>
 
<P>
New support that provides automated switch over for pairs of Compaq
servers connected via a serial link.  The system is composed of
the Compaq ProLiant Storage, Recovery Server switch and the
On-Line Recovery agent.  If one system fails, the surviving server
detects the failure and causes the switch of the drives from the
failed server to itself.  This feature is listed in the SSD as
option line-item Compaq On-Line Recovery Server.
<P>
New Features in Compaq NT SSD Version 1.16 Pass A
<P>
<P><h3>Compaq NT SSD Setup</h3>
 
<P>
Added the option line-item Convert to Uniprocessor Support  when
downgrading from a multi to single processor unit.
<P>
Added the option line-item Upgrade to Multiprocessor Support
when upgrading from a single to multiprocessor-processor unit.
<P>
Added the option line-item Compaq On-Line Recovery Agent for
support.
<P>
<P><h3>Compaq HAL Support</h3>
 
<P>
Added new support for the Advanced Program Interrupt Controller
(APIC) for  dual processor support (HALMPS.DLL)
<P>
Fixed a problem where the /PRINT option in BOOT.INI can now work
with the crashdump utility.
<P>
Fixed a problem where a time delay was occurring per array
controller during shutdown with a Compaq Array Controller
installed in the system
<P>
Added a /MOVEINT BOOT.INI option.  (See the Compaq HAL features
for more detailed information).
<P>
<P><h3>Compaq 32-Bit SCSI-2 Controllers SCSI Miniport Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Fixed a problem where the driver was not detecting disabled
Compaq 32-Bit Fast-Wide SCSI-2 /E controllers.
<P>
Updated NCR SCSI processor script code
<P>
Additional code and resource optimizations
<P>
<P><h3>Compaq ProLiant  Storage System Driver</h3>

Fixed a problem where the device indicator information in the
device slot pages were not being updated when indicator states
changed.
<P>

<P>
<P><h3>Compaq Systems Management Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Fixed a problem where under heavy stress the system will
experience a lock up.  This problem will only occur on Compaq
ProLiant 4000 and ProLiant 4500 installed with 4 processors.
<P>
<P><h3>Compaq Integrated NetFlex-L Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Modified interrupt routine to be able to see an Apple Talk
Network on a Windows NT system.
<P>
Fixed a problem where the correct maximum lookahead value was
not getting reported correctly.
<P>
Fixed a problem where the All Multicast list was getting
overwritten by a request to change to receive a specific multicast

Fixed a problem where the adapter might not initialize because
of timeout events with assigning interrupts.
