The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You have configured your Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) server to
start replication at a specific time with a specific replication interval.
However, you notice that replication does not occur at the specified time.
Additionally, you may notice that WINS reacts differently depending on the
version of Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The start time for replication is ignored if the specified time has passed
when the WINS server is started.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the fix mentioned below, or wait for the next Windows NT service
pack.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you set the replication start time to 1:00 AM and the replication
interval to 24 hours, and then start WINS (or restart the computer) at any
time after 1:00 AM and before 12:00 AM (for example, at 10:00AM), the
replication will start the next day at 10:00 AM. The replication will start
as specified if WINS is started between 12:00 AM and 1:00 AM.
