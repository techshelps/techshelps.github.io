<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Some versions of the Media Vision Fusion 16 CD kit are not compatible
with Windows NT. Some versions of the kit come with proprietary CD-ROM
drive interfaces and CD-ROM drives.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Media Vision Fusion 16 CD kit comes with a ProAudio Spectrum (PAS)
sound card which has a CD-ROM interface built into it. Media Vision
ships at least three different versions of the Pro AudioSpectrum 16
sound card. Two have proprietary interfaces and are shipped with the
Media Vision Fusion 16 CD kits. The third version of the card ships
with the standard 50-pin SCSI interface. This card ships standalone or
as part of the new DoubleSpeed Fusion 16 kits bundled with an NEC
CD-ROM drive. The 50-pin SCSI is the only PAS interface supported
under Windows NT. The other two Fusion CD kits and their respective
cards do not function under NT.
<P>
The easiest way to differentiate between the cards is to look at the
connecting pin layout. The oldest PAS Fusion CD 16 kit came with the
Philips/LMSI CM205 CD-ROM drive and has a proprietary 16-pin
connection on the PAS 16 card. The interim version of the PAS Fusion
CD 16 kit came with a Sony CDU-31a and also had a proprietary 34-pin
connnection on the PAS 16 card. The only PAS 16 board that comes with
the Fusion CD 16 and is supported under Windows NT is the 50-pin SCSI
version that is shipping in the newest Fusion CD 16 kit with the NEC
drive. Neither of the proprietary interfaces work under Windows NT.
<P>
NOTE: Although the 50-pin SCSI version is the only one supported, in
many cases to obtain CD-Audio output the user must plug into the jack
on the front of the CD-ROM drive and into the LINE-IN on the back of
the PAS 16. This is a known problem with the current driver. An
updated version may be available soon. Data accessibility should
function normally.
<P>
An additional way to tell the cards apart is to look in the CONFIG.SYS
file and determine which CD-ROM driver is in use under MS-DOS. The
Philips/LMSI CD-ROM driver is called DD250.SYS and the Sony driver
is called SLCD.SYS. The standard SCSI driver for the PAS 16 board is
TSLCDR.SYS.
<P>
If at the time of purchase you are trying to decide which board and
drive combination is in the box, both the Philips/LMSI and the Sony
Fusion CD 16 kits are labeled on the box as having such drives.
Additionally, it is only the newest version of the Fusion CD 16 kit
with the NEC CD-ROM drives that are being shipped with the SCSI 50-pin
PAS. At no time prior to this did the Fusion CD 16 kit ship with the
50-pin SCSI board.
<P>
NOTE: The Windows NT supplied driver for the Sony CDU-31a will not
work in conjunction with the PAS 16. The CDU-31a must be used with the
proprietary board supplied with the drive in order for the Windows NT
driver to work.
