<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a Remote Access Service (RAS) client dials into your Windows NT RAS
server running remote access server, the client may be disconnected during
the authentication process or shortly thereafter. Also, you may receive an
event log message in the event viewer on the RAS server similar to the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 20050
   Source: RemoteAccess
   Description: The user DOM\User connected on port Com1 on &lt;date&gt; at
                &lt;time&gt; and disconnected on &lt;date&gt; at &lt;time&gt;. The user
                was active for &lt;time length&gt;. 326 bytes were sent and 512
                bytes were received. The port speed was 28800. The reason
                for disconnecting was administrator's request.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The cause of this problem may be a duplicate IP address on the network.
This can be due to one or more of the following:

<UL><LI>A user may be using an address that is in the server's RAS static pool.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The RAS administrator added entries to the RAS IP static pool that are
   already in use on the local area network (LAN).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The RAS server is using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for
   its RAS address pool and the DHCP server has had its database rebuilt.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, regardless of the cause affecting you, you must
verify that the pool of addresses being used by the RAS server is not in
use by other computers on the LAN. This can be done by using the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that there are no RAS clients connected to the RAS server.

<P><LI>From a command prompt, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ping &lt;ip address&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;ip address&gt; represents the IP addresses in the RAS pool.

<P><LI>Repeat step 2 for each address in the RAS pool.
<P>
</OL>If you receive a response from another computer, either the RAS server
addresses must be changed or the LAN workstation must have its address
changed.
<P>
To change the RAS pool of addresses, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click Network in Control Panel and click Services.

<P><LI>Click Remote Access Service (or Routing and Remote Access).

<P><LI>Click Properties, click Network, and click Configure for the TCP/IP
   protocol.

<P><LI>If the RAS server is configured to assign addresses through DHCP, force
   the RAS server to obtain a new set of leases from the DHCP Server. If
   the RAS server is configured with a static pool of addresses, edit the
   address range to include unique addresses.
