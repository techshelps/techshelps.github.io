The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The network share connection behavior from Windows NT to a share-level
security network share (typically a Windows for Workgroups computer) has
changed from version 3.1 to version 3.5 of Windows NT. From a computer
running Windows NT 3.1, sometimes you cannot connect from File Manager with
full access to a computer running Windows for Workgroups due to the manner
in which Windows NT handles password verification. Under version 3.5, this
behavior has changed so that you can always gain full access. You may
notice this change because you are prompted for your network password more
often in Windows NT File Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Network Connection Behavior Under Windows NT 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
When you attempt to log onto a Windows for Workgroups computer from a
Windows NT 3.1 computer, Windows NT sends your Windows NT user account
password by default to the Windows for Workgroups computer. If the Windows
for Workgroups computer's share-level password matches your Windows NT
account password, the connection is successful.
<P>
However, if the network share on the Windows for Workgroups computer is
configured with a full access password and no Read-Only password, then an
attempt to connect to the share with any password that does not match the
full access password succeeds with Read-Only access granted.
<P>
If your Windows NT password does not match the share's full access
password, you cannot connect with full access even if you know the required
password. This is because File Manager always defaults to sending your
Windows NT password when attempting to access a network share. If File
Manager cannot connect to a share with your password it does prompt you for
a connection password, but, since a Read-Only connection is established,
File Manager does not prompt you to enter any password. Under this
circumstance, the only way you can gain full access to this share is by
using the NET USE command from Command Prompt.
<P>
<P><h3>Network Connection Behavior Under Windows NT 3.5</h3>
 
<P>
When you attempt to log onto a Windows for Workgroups computer from a
Windows NT 3.5 computer, Windows NT sends a special "no password" if it
detects share-level security. If the share is password-protected, this
causes the password validation to fail and you are prompted for a
connection password. This enables you to gain full access to a network
share from File Manager, no matter what your Windows NT password is or how
the network share is configured.
<P>
After you have upgraded to Windows NT 3.5, you may notice when connecting
to some network shares that you used to be able to connect to without
specifying a password, that you are now prompted for an additional
password, even if the password you type is the same as your Windows NT
password.
