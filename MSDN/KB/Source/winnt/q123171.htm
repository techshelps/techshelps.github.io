<P>
<PRE>Event   Description
-----   -----------

4145    WINS has encountered an error that is causing it to shut down.

4146    Rpl Pull thread is shutting down due to some error condition.

4147    Rpl Push thread is shutting down due to some error condition.

4148    Challenge thread is shutting down due to some error condition.

4149    A Worker thread is shutting down due to some error condition.

4150    An abnormal error was encountered during WINS initialization.

4151    WINS could not set up the database properly.

4152    A worker thread could not be created.

4153    A thread could not be created.

4154    An event could not be created.

4155    The Name Challenge  Request thread could not be created.

4156    A key could not be created/opened.

4157    The WINS configuration key could not be created/opened.

4158    The WINS PULL configuration key could not be created/opened.

4159    The WINS PUSH configuration key could not be created/opened.

4160    The WINS PARAMETERS key could not be created/opened.

4161    The Registry change notification event could not be created.

4162    The format of time should be hh:mm:ss. Check value of "SpTime"
        in the Registry.

4163    The Registry Notify Function returned an error.

4164    The Name Registration Response could not be sent due to some
        error. This Error was encountered by a NBT request thread.

4165    The Name Registration Response could not be sent due to some
        error. This error was encountered by a RPL thread.

4166    The Name Registration Response could not be sent due to some
        error. This error was encountered by the Name Challenge Thread.

4167    The Name Release Response could not be sent due to some error.
        This error was encountered by a NBT request thread.

4168    The Name Query Response could not be sent due to some error.
        This error was encountered by a NBT request thread.

4169    A record could not be registered because it already existed.
        However, the same record then could not be found. The database
        might be corrupt.

4170    WINS could not create a heap (a portion of memory reserved for
        the program's use) because of a resource shortage. Check if the
        computer is running short of virtual memory.

4171    An error has occurred from which WINS will try to recover. If
        recovery fails, check previous Event log entries to determine
        what went wrong, and take appropriate action on that error.

4172    WINS could not create the notification socket. Make sure the
        TCP/IP driver is installed and running properly.

4173    WINS could not create the UDP socket for listening for
        connection notification messages sent  by another thread (PULL
        thread) in the local WINS.

4174    WINS could not create the TCP socket for listening to TCP
        connections. Make sure the TCP/IP driver is installed and
        running properly.

4175    WINS could not create the TCP socket for making a TCP connection.
        Make sure the TCP/IP driver is installed and running properly.

4176    Could not bind an address to a socket.

4177    Could not listen on the listening socket.

4178    Select returned with an error.

4179    %1 returned with an error code of %2.

4180    GetSockName returned with an error. WINS created a socket and
        asked bind to bind a handle to it. On calling getsockname to
        determine the address bound, it got an error.

4181    An attempt to connect to the remote WINS server with address %1
        returned with an error. Check to see that the remote WINS server
        is running and available, and that WINS is  running on that
        server.

4182    Could not accept on a socket.

4183    Could not read from the UDP socket.

4184    Could not read from NETBT.

4185    Could not close a socket.

4186    Sendto could not send all the bytes.

4187    Could not send UDP message to WINS client.

4188    Sendto returned with an error.

4189    Winsock recv function returned with an unexpected error.

4190    WinSock send function returned with an unexpected error.

4191    A message was received on an association. The association is in
        a bad state. This indicates a bug in WINS code.

4192    Could not allocate a responder association.

4193    Could not allocate an initiator association.

4194    Could not allocate an implicit dialogue.

4195    Could not allocate an explicit dialogue.

4196    Could not look up the assoc block for an NBT association. Check
        if the message read is corrupted. WINS looks at bit 11-14 of the
        message to determine if the association is from another WINS or
        from an NBT node. It is possible that the bits are corrupted or
        that there is a mismatch between what the two WINS servers expect
        to see in those bits (maybe you changed the value to be put in
        code and did not increment the version number sent during
        association setup.

4197    Could not allocate a UDP Buffer.

4198    Could not free a UDP Buffer.

4199    Could not create a communication subsystem thread.

4200    A WINS thread could not signal the main thread after closing its
        session. This would be the last thread in WINS closing the
        database.

4201    A WINS thread could not signal a handle.

4202    A WINS thread could not reset a handle.

4203    An error was encountered in the database. You might need to
        restore the database from a backup.

4204    Could not update a record with name %1.

4205    WINS could not update the owner id - Address mapping table in the
        database.  This indicates a serious error in the software.  It
        means that the in-memory table that maps to the database table has
        gotten out of sync with the database table.

4206    The Push Thread was requested for a range of records but could not
        find any in the range. This is a serious error. Make sure that the
        time intervals are set properly. If the tombstone interval and
        timeout intervals are not correct (i.e. too small-- being &lt;&lt; the
        replication interval), the above condition is possible. This is
        because the records might get changed into tombstones and then
        deleted before the remote WINS can pull them. In the same vein, if
        the refresh interval is set to be &lt;&lt; replication interval then the
        records could get released before a WINS can pull them (a released
        record is not sent).

4207    The Tmm Thread could not be signaled. This indicates that this
        computer is extremely overloaded or that the WINS application
        has failed.

4208    Tmm could not signal the client thread. This indicates something
        seriously wrong.

4209    WINS could not get information about a key.

4210    WINS could not get information about the PULL key.

4211    WINS could not get information about the PUSH key.

4212    WINS could not get information about the DATAFILES key.

4213    WINS could not get information about the SPEC_GRP_MASKS key.

4214    WINS could not open a subkey of the PULL key

4215    WINS could not open a subkey of the PUSH key.

4216    WINS could not get the time interval from a PULL record.

4217    WINS could not get the time interval from a PUSH record.

4218    WINS could not get the update count from a PUSH record.

4219    WINS could not close an open key.

4220    WINS Timer thread encountered an exception.

4221    WINS Push thread encountered an exception. It will try to recover.

4222    WINS Pull thread encountered an exception during the process of
        sending a push notification to another WINS. The exception
        code is given below in the data section.

4223    A WINS RPC thread encountered an error/exception.

4224    WINS TCP Listener thread encountered an exception.

4225    WINS UDP Listener thread encountered an exception.

4226    WINS Scavenger thread encountered an exception.

4227    WINS Challenger thread encountered an exception.

4228    A WINS worker thread encountered an exception.

4229    WINS Scavenger thread could not scavenge a record. Will ignore
        this error and continue on to the next record if there.

4230    WINS Rpl Pul Handler could not connect to a WINS server. All
        retries failed. WINS will try again after certain number of
        replication time intervals have elapsed.

4231    WINS did not find any subkeys under the PULL key

4232    WINS did not find any subkeys under the PUSH key

4233    An error has prevented wins from updating the database. The
        database may be corrupt.

4234    WINS is has been asked to pull entries from its own self. Check
all
        the subkeys of the PULL key for this WINS.

4235    WINS was unable to propagate the push trigger.

4236    WINS sent a name query or a name release with a certain
        transaction id. It got back a response to its request, which
        differed either in the name that it contained or in the opcode.
        WINS has thrown the response away.

4237    The Database has been found to be inconsistent. More specifically,
        the number of owners found in the Name Address Mapping table are
        different from the number found in the Owner Address Mapping table

4238    The local WINS requested a remote WINS to update the version
        number of a database record owned by it. The remote WINS could not
        do it and reported an error.

4239    WINS got an error while registering replicas. It will not register
        any more replicas of this WINS (address is in data section 4th-8th
        byte; also check previous log entry) at this time.  Please check
        a previous log entry to determine the reason for this. If this
        error persists over time i.e. you get the same error during
        subsequent replication with the above partner WINS, you may want
        to restore the database from the backup.

4240    WINS got an exception while trying to register a group's replica
        with name %1. The replica is owned by WINS with address %2.

4241    WINS got an error while trying to register a unique replica with
        name %1. The replica is owned by WINS with address %2.

4242    WINS got an error while trying to register a unique entry %1.

4243    WINS got an error while trying to register a group entry %1.

4244    WINS got an exception while trying to update the version number of
        a record in the database. It is not known whether the exception
        occurred after  or before the update.

4245    WINS got an exception while trying to release a record in
        the database. It is not known whether the exception occurred
        after or before the release was done.

4246    WINS got an exception while trying to query a record in the
        database.

4247    WINS received a replica whose state is incorrect. For example, the
        state may be RELEASED or the replica might be an Internet group
        that does not have any members (because all members are timed out)
        but state is not TOMBSTONE.

4248    The Scavenger thread was unable to change its priority level.

4249    A name release request was received for a record that didn't match
        the unique/group type indicated in the request.  The request has
        been ignored.

4250    A name release request was received for a record %2 that didn't
        have the same address as the requestor. The request has been
        ignored.

4251    An exception was encountered while trying send a push trigger
        notification to a remote WINS.

4252    An exception was encountered while trying service a pull range
        request from a remote WINS.

4253    WINS was either provided a bad command code or else it got
        corrupted.

4254    The static data file that is used to initialize WINS database is
        too big.

4255    An error was encountered during an operation on the static data
        file %1.

4256    The name of the file after expansion is bigger than WINS can
        handle. The unexpanded string is %1.

4257    WINS could not do Static initialization

4258    An error was encountered during configuration or reconfiguration
        of WINS.

4259    Error encountered during configuration/reconfiguration of WINS.

4260    A lock error has occurred.  This could happen if the WINS is
        trying to send a response on a dialogue that is no longer ACTIVE.
        An implicit dialogue can cease to exist if the association it is
        mapped to terminates. In such a case, getting a lock error is
        fine. It is normal.

4261    Wins could not import static mappings from the file (%1).
        Please verify that the file exists and is readable.

4262    WINS encountered an exception while processing a push
        trigger/update notification. The exception code is given below.
        If it is indicates a comm. failure check if the remote WINS that
        sent the trigger went down. If the remote WINS is on a different
        subnet, then maybe the router is down.

4263    WINS encountered an exception while processing a pull trigger.

4264    WINS encountered an exception while retrieving data records

4265    The WINS server can not make/accept this connection since the
        limit of connections has been reached. Remedy for this is to
        increase FD_SETSIZE in winsock.h and recompile the server.

4266    The exception was encountered during the processing of a grp
        member.

4267    The Scavenger thread encountered an exception while cleaning up
        the owner-add table. It will try again after the Verify Interval
        has elapsed.

4268    WINS is trying to update the version number of a database record
        that it does not own.  This is a serious error if the WINS
        server is updating the record after a conflict.  It is not a
        serious error if the WINS server is updating the record as a
        result of a request to do so from a remote WINS server (when a
        remote WINS server notices a conflict between an active owned entry
        and a replica it informs the owner of the replica to update the
        version number of the record. It is  possible that the replica is
        no longer owned by the remote WINS). Check a previous log entry to
        determine which situation applies here.

4269    The special group mask specified is invalid. It has either a non-
        hex character or is less than 32 characters in length. A hex
        character is in the range 0-F (or 0-f).

4270    Wins tried increasingly sized buffers to get the local name table
        from NETBT but got a buffer overflow return status each time.

4271    WINS did not get back any names from NETBT when it did an adapter
        status.

4272    At initialization, WINS creates a security object and attaches an
        ACL to it. This security object is then used to authenticate RPC
        calls made to WINS. WINS could not create the above security
        object. In short, WINS could not initialize with the security
        subsystem properly.

4273    The client does not have the permissions required to execute the
        function.

4274    When WINS replicated with its partners, it found that one or more
        of them thought that it had more data that it actually has.
        WINS adjusted its counter so that new registrations/updates are
        seen by its partners. This means that recovery did not work
        properly. You may want to check which of the partners has the
        highest version number corresponding to the local WINS. Then shut
        down WINS and restart after specifying this number in the
        Registry.

4275    There are too many concurrent static initializations going on.
        The number of such initializations currently active is given below.
        This could be either as a result of reinitialization or importings
        from the WINS Manager tool. Try again later. The number of
        currently active initializations is given below in the data
        section.

4276    WINS encountered a memory error.  Check to see if the system is
        running out of virtual memory.

4277    WINS noticed some database corruption. The record with name %1 is
        corrupt. It could be that recovery from the last crash did not
        work properly. WINS will try to recover. You may decide however to
        restore the database from the backup.

4278    The following name (%1) is too long. It has not been put in the
        WINS database. If you want this long name (&gt; 15 characters),
        enclose it within quotes.

4279    Record with name (%1) has bad address. It has not been put in the
        WINS database.

4280    The machine you are running the WINS server on does not have a
        valid address. When WINS requested the system for the address, it
        got 0.0.0.0 as the address. NOTE: WINS binds to the first adapter
        in a machine with more than one adapter bound to TCP/IP. Check the
        binding order of adapters and make sure the first one has a valid
        IP address for the WINS server.

4281    WINS encountered an error doing backup of the database to
        directory %1.

4282    WINS countered an error while deleting the file %1.

4283    WINS encountered an error while deleting one or more records of
        WINS with address %1. Check a previous log entry to determine what
        went wrong.

4284    WINS encountered an error while getting the browser names for a
        client.

4285    The length of the message sent by another WINS indicates a very
        big message. There may have been a corruption of the data on the
        wire. WINS will ignore this message, terminate the connection with
        the remote WINS, and continue on.

4286    The replicator PULL thread of WINS encountered an exception while
        processing a request. Check other log entries to determine what
        went wrong.

4287    WINS does not support this functionality as yet.

4288    WINS machine has %1 processors. It has %2 bytes of physical memory
        It has %3 bytes of available memory for allocation.

4289    Record with name (%1) could not replace another record in the db.
        The Version number of the record is (%2). The version number of
        record in db  is (%3)

4290    WINS could not come up due to missing/corrupt database.
        Restore the database using WINSADMN and then restart
        WINS. If WINS still does not come up, start with a
        fresh  copy of the database. To do this:

        1) delete all the files
           - system.mdb, winstmp.mdb files from the
             %%SystemRoot%%\system32\wins directory.
           - wins.mdb from the %%SystemRoot%%\system32 directory
             or one that you selected through the Registry.
           - jet*.log files from the %%SystemRoot%%\system32 directory
             or one that you selected through the Registry.

        2) copy %%SystemRoot%%\system32\system.mdb to
           %%SystemRoot%%\system32\wins directory

        3) net start wins
