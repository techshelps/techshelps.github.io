The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to open a file on a Windows NT-based computer over the
network and the file is open on another client computer with sharing
restrictions, there is a delay of approximately one second before the
sharing violation error message is returned. If the client application is
accessing a number of files on the server, then this delay may become
significant.
<P>
NOTE: This behavior is not observed when accessing files on LAN Manager or
Windows for Workgroups shares.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is an optimization in the Windows NT Server service which delays
returning a status to the client while it attempts to resolve the sharing
violation internally.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes it may be preferable to disable this optimization. In order to
do this it is necessary to make two registry additions which are detailed
below.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe.)

<P><LI>Go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
<PRE></PRE>         \LanmanServer\Parameters

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: SharingViolationDelay
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
<PRE></PRE>      Data:       0 (Default: 200)

   and:

      Value Name: SharingViolationRetries
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
      Data:       0 (Default: 5)

</PRE><P><LI>Shut down and restart Windows NT.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the Server service receives a request for an already open file, it
receives a sharing violation from the local server. It then waits for a
short period before trying to access the file again. This process is
repeated a number of times, internally to the server, in an attempt to
resolve the problem before returning to the client.
<P>
This feature is controlled by two registry values which are detailed
below.

<UL><LI>SharingViolationDelay
<P>
   Default 200 (msec)
<P>
   This is the time the server waits between retries. If too low, the
   server receives multiple sharing violations. If too high, the Server
   Message Block (SMB) response to the client might be delayed more than
   is necessary, thus reducing performance.

<LI>SharingViolationRetries
<P>
   Default 5
<P>
   This is the number of times the server retries an SMB requested
   operation when it receives a sharing violation from the local server's
   file system. Operations affected include open, rename, and delete. This
   minimizes network traffic because if the server can resolve the sharing
   violation locally, the remote client need not retry the operation.
