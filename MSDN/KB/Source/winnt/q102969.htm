The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<P>
</UL>The article contains REGISTRY entries for the Server service, Part 2. There
are no subgroups.
 
<P>
This is the second of two articles on these entries; for the other entries,
see "Server Service Entries, Part 1".
<P>
<P><h2>SERVER SERVICE ENTRIES</h2>
 
<P>
With Registry Editor, you can modify the startup parameters for the Server
service. Unless otherwise noted, these parameters are found in this path:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet
   \Services\LanmanServer\Parameters

</PRE>The parameters that control network bindings for this service are described
in the article on "NetRules Subkey Entries."
<P>
This is the second of two articles on these entries; for the other entries,
see Server Service Entries, Part 1.
<P>
<PRE>MinFreeConnections   REG_DWORD   2 to 5 items
</PRE> 
Default: (depends upon configuration)
<P>
Specifies the minimum number of free connection blocks maintained per
endpoint.
<P>
<PRE>MinFreeWorkItems   REG_DWORD   0 to 10 items
</PRE> 
Default: 2
<P>
Specifies the minimum number of available receive work items that are
needed for the server to begin processing a potentially blocking SMB. A
larger value for this parameter ensures that work items are available more
frequently for nonblocking requests, but it also increases the likelihood
that blocking requests will be rejected.
<P>
<PRE>MinKeepSearch   REG_DWORD   5 to 5000 seconds
</PRE> 
Default: 480
<P>
Specifies the minimum amount of time that the server will keep incomplete
MS DOS searches, even if more search entries are needed. This parameter
only matters when the server is near the maximum number of open searches it
is allowed.
<P>
<PRE>MinLinkThroughput   REG_DWORD   0 to infinite bytes per second
</PRE> 
Default: 0
<P>
Specifies the minimum link throughput allowed by the server before it
disables raw and opportunistic locks for this connection.
<P>
<PRE>MinRcvQueue   REG_DWORD   0 to 10 items
</PRE> 
Default: 2
<P>
Specifies the minimum number of free receive work items needed by the
server before it begins allocating more. A larger value for this parameter
helps ensure that there will always be work items available, but a value
that is too large is simply inefficient.
<P>
<PRE>NetworkErrorThreshold   REG_DWORD   1 to 100 percent
</PRE> 
Default: 5 percent
<P>
Triggers an alert whenever the percentage of failing network operations
relative to total network operations exceeds this value during the
AlertSched interval.
<P>
<PRE>NumBlockThreads   REG_DWORD   1 to 10 threads
</PRE> 
Default: (depends on configuration)
<P>
Specifies the number of threads set aside by the server to service requests
that can block the thread for a significant amount of time. Larger values
can increase performance but use more memory. A value that is too large can
impede performance by causing excessive task switching.
<P>
<PRE>OpenSearch   REG_DWORD   1 to 2048 searches
</PRE> 
Default: 2048
<P>
Specifies the maximum number of outstanding searches on the server, per
connection. A single client can have up to the OpenSearch number of active
searches. This includes all types of searches, including MS- DOS, OS/2, and
Windows NT.
<P>
<PRE>OplockBreakWait   REG_DWORD   10 to 180 seconds
</PRE> 
Default: 35
<P>
Specifies the time that the server waits for a client to respond to an
oplock break request. Smaller values can allow detection of crashed clients
more quickly but can potentially cause loss of cached data.
<P>
<PRE>RawWorkItems   REG_DWORD   1 to 512 items
</PRE> 
Default: (depends on configuration)
<P>
Specifies the number of special work items for raw I/O that the server
uses. A larger value for this parameter can increase performance but costs
more memory.
<P>
<PRE>ScavTimeout   REG_DWORD   1 to 300 seconds
</PRE> 
Default: 30
<P>
Specifies the time that the scavenger remains idle before waking up to
service requests. A smaller value for this parameter improves the response
of the server to various events but costs CPU cycles.
<P>
<PRE>ScavQosInfoUpdateTime   REG_DWORD   0 to 100,000 seconds
</PRE> 
Default: 300
<P>
Specifies the time that can pass before the scavenger goes through the list
of active connections to update the link information.
<P>
<PRE>SessConns   REG_DWORD   1 to 2048 connections
</PRE> 
Default: 2048
<P>
Specifies the maximum number of tree connections that can be made on the
server via a single virtual circuit.
<P>
<PRE>SessOpens   REG_DWORD   1 to 2048 files
</PRE> 
Default: 2048
<P>
Specifies the maximum number of files that can be open on a single virtual
circuit.
<P>
<PRE>SessUsers   REG_DWORD   1 to 64 users
</PRE> 
Default: 32
<P>
Specifies the maximum number of users that can be logged on to a server via
a single virtual circuit.
<P>
<PRE>SizReqBuf   REG_DWORD   512 to 65536 bytes
</PRE> 
Default: 4356
<P>
Specifies the size of request buffers that the server uses. Small buffers
use less memory; large buffers may improve performance.
<P>
<PRE>ThreadCountAdd   REG_DWORD   0 to 10 threads
</PRE> 
Default: (depends on configuration)
<P>
The server uses one worker thread per processor for the computer it is
running on. This parameter indicates how many additional threads the server
should use. More threads can improve performance but cost memory. Too many
threads can hurt performance by causing excessive task switching.
<P>
<PRE>ThreadPriority   REG_DWORD   0, 1, 2, or 15
</PRE> 
Default: 1
<P>
Specifies the priority of all server threads in relation to the base
priority of the process. Higher priority can give better server performance
at the cost of local responsiveness. Lower priority balances server needs
with the needs of other processes on the system. Values 0 to 2 are relative
to normal or background processes. The default value of 1 is equivalent to
the foreground process. A value of 15 runs the server threads at real-time
priority-which is not recommended.
<P>
<PRE>Users   REG_DWORD   1 to infinite
</PRE> 
Default: 0xFFFFFFFF (infinite)
<P>
Specifies the maximum number of users that can be simultaneously logged on
to the server.
<P>
<PRE>XactMemSize   REG_DWORD   64 KB to 16 MB0
</PRE> 
Default: 1 MB
<P>
Specifies the maximum amount of virtual memory used by the Xactsrv service.
A larger value for this parameter helps ensure that memory is available for
downlevel clients but costs virtual address space and potentially costs
pageable memory.
<P>
