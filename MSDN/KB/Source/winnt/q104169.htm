The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious,
system-wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to
correct them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting
from the use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your
own risk.
<P>
NOTE: In U.S. Service Packs 2 (and later) for Windows NT version 3.1,
NTBackup does not use the Registry, but uses %SYSTEMROOT%\NTBACKUP.INI.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT Backup program (NTBACKUP.EXE) automatically skips the
following types of files during the backup and restore processes:

<UL><LI>Files that are locked by another application other than Windows NT
   Backup
<P>
   -and-

<LI>Files that are skipped by default by Windows NT Backup
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Files That Are Locked by Another Application
Other Than Windows NT Backup
 
<P>
Windows NT supports the backup of local files that are exclusively
locked by the operating system, such as event logs and registry files;
however, another type of skipped file that Windows NT Backup
encounters is that which is in use and locked by another process.
<P>
In this kind of event, Windows NT Backup displays a "Skip Open Files
Wait Time" dialog box. An internal timer is then started and Windows
NT Backup waits 30 seconds for the file to become available. During
that time, Windows NT Backup continuously attempts to access the
locked file. If the file does not become available during the
30-second waiting period, Windows NT Backup skips the file, places its
name in the backup log file (if the log is enabled), marks it as
skipped in the log, and continues to the next file. You have the
option to choose the Cancel button in the dialog box and immediately
move to the next file, logging the skipped file as previously
described. If the file becomes available before the 30-second time-out
period, Windows NT Backup backs up that file and continues with the
rest of the backup.
<P>
If the file has an attached alternate data stream that is locked,
Windows NT waits 30 seconds for the stream to become available. If the
stream does not become available in that time, Windows NT Backup makes
an entry in the log (if enabled) indicating that the file was corrupt.
<P>
You can modify the following registry entries to adjust the skipped
files options:
<P>
<PRE>   HKey_current_user\Software\Microsoft\Ntbackup\User Interface

   Name:            Skip open files
   Type:            REG_SZ
   Default:         0
   Definition:
   0 = do not skip, wait
   1 = skip files that are opened unreadable
   2 = wait on open files for "Wait time"

   Name:            Wait time
   Type:            REG_SZ
   Data:            30
   Definition:
   Maximum time (seconds) to wait for open files. Default is 30 seconds.
   Maximum value is 65535

</PRE><h3>Files That Are Skipped by Default by Windows NT Backup</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Files you do not have permission to read. Only those with backup
   rights can copy files they do not own in Windows NT Backup.

<LI>Files that are temporary in nature--such as PAGEFILE.SYS,
   WIN386.SWP, 386SPART.PAR, BACKUP.LOG, and RESTORE.LOG--are neither
   backed up nor restored by Windows NT Backup. The list of skipped files
   is hard-coded into Windows NT Backup and cannot be changed.

<LI>Registry files on remote computers. Windows NT backs up only local
   registry files.
