The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In User Manager for Domains, when you select Forcibly Disconnect Remote
Users From Server When Logon Hours Expire and specify limited logon hours
for an account, the following problems occur for Macintosh accounts:

<UL><LI>Users are not warned that their logon is about to expire.
<LI>Users are not disconnected when their logons expire.
<LI>Disconnects occur after the scheduled disconnect time.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The 10 minute countdown prior to disconnect is not scheduled to run until
one minute before the disconnect time. Several timers are not started and
reset on time. This problem may be more evident for those connecting with
guest sessions.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server version
3.5. This problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows
NT version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In User Manager for Domains you can limit users to certain logon hours. For
example, you can limit a user to logon between 8 AM and 5 PM, and select
Forcibly Disconnect Remote Users From Server When Logon Hours Expire in the
Account Policies dialog box.
<P>
A PC user with these logon hours will be notified with two messages stating
that they are about to be disconnected from the network and then one final
message stating that they have been disconnected from the network. If this
PC user then tries to connect to the server, access will be denied. Any
previous connections to the server will be disconnected.
<P>
Macintosh users that are connected to Macintosh volumes on the server
should be sent a message 10 minutes before being forcibly disconnected from
the server with at least one more reminder before being disconnected. If
logon hours are exceeded the Macintosh users as well as the PC users with
the restricted hours should be forcibly disconnected.
