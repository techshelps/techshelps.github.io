<P>
Enabling DMA devices to access memory beyond 16 MB is handled by the
hardware abstraction layer (HAL). When Windows NT boots, the HAL reserves
some memory in the lower 16 MB. When a DMA device initializes, it informs
the HAL of its characteristics and limitations, such as only 24 address
lines (maximum 16 MB of address space). Later, when the DMA device needs to
do DMA, it requests the physical address of the buffer using the
IoMapTransfer call. The HAL checks to see if this buffer is accessible to
the device. If the buffer cannot be reached by the device the HAL uses one
if its pages instead. If the operation is a write, then the data is copied
from high memory to the lower memory. When the DMA device has completed the
data transfer, it notifies the HAL using the IoFlushAdapterBuffers call. If
the operation was a read, data is copied from low memory to high memory.
Using this interface the driver never has to be concerned about where the
memory is located.
<P>
A few additional notes: The buffer allocated by the HAL is contiguous so
that it can also be used by devices that do not support scatter/gather such
as floppy drives. The buffer is shared by all devices that need to use it
and grows according to expected usage and memory size. Finally, the data is
only copied when necessary.
