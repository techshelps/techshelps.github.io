<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides answers to some of the most commonly asked questions
about the role of a Windows NT 3.5 server in a domain.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Why use a Server?</h3>
 
<P>
A server does not have to spend resources processing domain logons. Domain
controllers spend part of their time processing logons and replicating the
security database.
<P>
The server allows you to mix and match security; accounts may be created in
the local security database and assigned to local resources. Any of the
domain accounts (and accounts from trusted domains) can be assigned to
local resources if the server is a member of a domain.
<P>
A server is easier to move to a different domain than a backup domain
controller. A backup domain controller must be reinstalled in the new
domain, but the server can change its domain membership without
reinstalling Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h3>What is the Difference Between a Domain Controller (DC) and a Server?</h3>
 
<P>
A server:

<UL><LI>does not get a copy of the domain account database, but does have access
   to it.

<LI>Maintains its own local user account database.

<LI>Does not process domain logons.

<LI>Has the same built-in user groups as a Windows NT Workstation (including
   Power Users).

<LI>Can be configured as a member of a domain or workgroup.
<P>
</UL><h3>How Are Local Accounts Different From Domain Accounts?</h3>
 
<P>
Local accounts are defined in the local account database. In the User
Manager at the server, they are represented by the user or group name, (for
example, Administrators). Only local groups exist on a server.
<P>
Domain accounts are defined on the primary domain controller (PDC) and
replicated to the backup domain controller (BDC). Domain accounts are
represented by the user or group name and qualified by the domain name (for
example, DOMAIN1\Domain Admins). Both local and global groups may be
defined in a domain.
<P>
An Administrator can work with the local account database (choose
Select Domain from the User Manager for Domains User menu and then
select or add the local machine name).
<P>
<P><h3>How Does the Server Validate Users and Rights?</h3>
 
<P>
The server maintains a local account database, independent of the domain
account database.
<P>
When a server joins a domain, certain domain groups are added to groups in
the server's local account database. For example, the Domain Admins group
is added to the local Administrators group and the Domain Users group is
added to the local Users group.
<P>
When a user requests access to a resource on the server, the server checks
its local account database to validate the user. If the server does not
have an entry for the user or group, it makes a request to a DC to validate
the user account. If a DC validates the user, the server gives the user
access. If not, access is denied. The server has a trust relationship with
the DC.
<P>
The server has access to all of the domain user information; a secure
communication channel is established between the server and the DC.
<P>
All domain accounts are available to the server's local Administrators for
assigning permissions to local resources.
<P>
<P><h3>Certain Accounts Cannot Administer the Server. Why?</h3>
 
<P>
When you logon to a server, you can either logon to the local machine or
logon to the domain (or any trusted domains). If you logon to the local
machine using a domain account, you are validated only if an identical
account exists on in the server's local account database.
<P>
By default, the server is set up so that all members of the Domain Admins
group can administer the server.
<P>
You can add additional accounts to the server's local Administrators group.
These accounts can be local accounts, domain accounts, or accounts defined
in any trusted domains.
<P>
<P><h3>Certain accounts cannot logon locally. Why?</h3>
 
<P>
By default, only the local Administrators group is given the right to
logon locally to the server. Since the Domain Admins group is added to the
local Administrators group by default, Domain Admins may logon locally.
You can use User Manager at the server to assign the Log on locally user
right to other accounts.
<P>
<P><h3>How do I Remotely Administer My Server?</h3>
 
<P>
To remotely administer the server, log onto a remote machine with an
account that is a member of the server's local Administrators group.
<P>
Although My Account Has Been Added to the Local Administrators Group, I
Still Get Access Denied Error Messages When I Remotely Administer the
Server. Why?
 
<P>
Your user account may exist in both the server's local account database
and the domain account database. This can cause a credentials conflict. If
the account exists in both places, remove it from the local database and
add the domain account to the server's local Administrators group.
<P>
<P><h3>How do I Assign Permissions When There are Trust Relationships?</h3>
 
<P>
If you have trusts, you can assign permissions for a server's resources to
any of the users or groups in the trusted domains. None of the trusted
domain groups are automatically added to local groups when the server
joins the domain, so you'll need to set this up yourself.
<P>
If you have users in the trusted domains who need to administer the server,
add their accounts to the local Administrators group. You can either add
the individual user account (for example, DOMAIN2\ UserAccount) or add
the Domain Admins group (for example, DOMAIN2\Domain Admins).
<P>
How Do I Give a User the Right to Administer the Server and Its
Resources But I Not the Domain?
 
<P>
If the user should not have access to any domain resources, but should have
the right to administer the server, create the user account in the local
account database of the server but don't create a domain account. The user
will need to select the local machine name and not the domain at logon
time.
