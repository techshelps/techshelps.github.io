The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following procedure will help you manage migrating your NetWare
accounts to Windows NT. The procedure requires the NetWare conversion
utilities included with Windows NT Server version 3.5, Windows NT Resource
Kit version 3.5 and Microsoft applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To better manage migrating NetWare accounts, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Migrate the user account from a Netware Server to a Windows NT Primary
   Domain Controller (PDC) using the Migration Tool for NetWare
   (NWCONV.EXE).

<P><LI>Use the ADDUSERS command to create a comma delimited text file of the
   users installed on the Windows NT Server. As an example, type the
   following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ADDUSERS \\&lt;ServerName&gt; /D USERS.CSV
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use Microsoft Excel and the *.CSV file you created. Open the file using
   the CSV filter provided with Excel.

<P><LI>Copy the users column of the spreadsheet and paste this information to
   a text editor such as Notepad. Save as NETWARE.BAT.

<P><LI>Using an MS-DOS editor, such as EDIT.COM, open the NETWARE.BAT file.

<P><LI>To help setup the user's home directory and share do the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a. Insert the following before the first user name:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         FOR %%X IN (&lt;Username&gt;)

      b. Go to the end of that line and press delete. The next user name
         will move up. Go to the end of the line and press delete again.
         The next user name will move up. Continue to do this, one name
         at a time, and fill up the line with all the users you can fit.
         One space is required between each user. End the line with the
         command you wish executed for each user on that line.

         NOTE: The number of users you can fit on a line varies (25 is
         average). It is important to ensure that no single line is greater
         than 255 characters (EDIT.COM program lets you know).

      c. Repeat the process for all lines. For example:

            FOR %%X IN (JOHN MARY GEORGE ALICE...) DO MKDIR C:\USERS\%%X
            FOR %%X IN (PAM JIM LAUREN MICHAL...) DO MKDIR C:\USERS\%%X
            :
            :

         NOTE: You can create as many lines as you need until each user is
         part of a FOR statement.

      d. For each line above, add the following:

            FOR %%X IN (&lt;Name1&gt; &lt;Name2&gt;... ) DO CACLS C:\USERS\%%X /G %%X:F

      e. Add the following to share the USERS directory:

            NET SHARE USERS=C:\USERS

</PRE><P><LI>Changing the user account information can be done with the NET USERS
   command. The command is robust and takes care of the majority of the
   changes required. To use the NET USERS command, repeat Step 6 and
   change the lines to read:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DO NET USERS %%X /HOMEDIR:\\&lt;ServerName&gt;\USERS\%%X
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This command adds a shared directory path to the user account
   in the Home Directory field of the user's profile in User Manager.
   You can make adjustments to accommodate more commands as required or
   repeat the process for each NET USERS command you would like to apply
   to the user's account.

<P><LI>To take advantage of the home directories, add the following command
   to the login script (the connection is not a persistent connection):
<P>
<P><PRE>      NET USE H: /HOME
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The /HOME option works for both Windows NT and Windows for
   Workgroups systems.

<P><LI>Make copies of all the files that you created during the process of
   Step 8, and save them. As you make changes to the Primary Domain
   Controller you may wish to update these files for use with future
   modifications. There are many options that can be set or changed for
   a large number of users.
<P>
</OL><h3>Example Batch File</h3>
 
<P>
For a group of just two users (for readability), JOHN and MARY:
<P>
<PRE>   FOR %%X IN (JOHN MARY) DO NET USERS %%X /ACTIVE:YES /EXPIRES:06/22/95
   FOR %%X IN (JOHN MARY) DO MKDIR C:\USERS\%%X
   FOR %%X IN (JOHN MARY) DO NET USERS %%X /SCRIPTPATH:LOGIN.BAT
   NET GROUP ENGINEERING /ADD /COMMENT:"ENGINEERS"
   FOR %%X IN (JOHN MARY) DO NET GROUP ENGINEERING %%X /ADD
   NET SHARE USERS=C:\USERS
   FOR %%X IN (JOHN MARY) DO NET USERS %%X /HOMEDIR:\\&lt;Server
       Name&gt;\USERS\%%X
   FOR %%X IN (JOHN MARY) DO CACLS C:\USERS\%%X /G %%X:F
      (NTFS Only - Sets the Users Directory permissions to Full Control)
   CACLS C:\USERS /G EVERYONE:R
      (NTFS Only - Sets the USERS directory to READONLY)
