<P><h2>REGISTRY ENTRIES FOR MICROSOFT SCHEDULE+</h2>
 
<P>
The settings used by Microsoft Schedule+ to track basic information about
the user’s schedule, such as display and general option settings, current
window positions, and printer information are stored under the following
key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Schedule+

</PRE>The Schedule+ key contains the following subkeys:
<P>
<PRE>Subkey                 Purpose
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>Microsoft Schedule     Defines the appearance and behavior of Schedule+.
Microsoft Schedule+    Indicates the number and list of other
Appt books             users's Appointment Books that were open when you
                       exited Schedule+.
Microsoft Schedule+    Indicates the number and list of Archive
Archives               files that were open when you exited Schedule+.
Microsoft Schedule+    Specifies DLL filenames for exporters.
</PRE>Exporters

</PRE>Importers
<P>
Most of these entries have built-in defaults. You should not need to change
the Schedule+ settings. To change the appearance and behavior of Schedule+,
use the appropriate Schedule+ menu commands. Many values are for saving
settings between sessions.
<P>
These keys are created in HKEY_CURRENT_USER when you first run Schedule+.
If your system previously contained a Windows for MS-DOS version of
SCHDPLUS.INI, the contents are migrated to the Registry when you first run
Schedule+ under Windows NT.
<P>
