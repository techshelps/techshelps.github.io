The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Over time, the Windows NT system responsiveness appears sluggish, and
clients may report a gradual decrease in system performance.
<P>
By tracking the amount of Private Bytes for Services.exe, it can be
observed that over time it increases without decreasing. This is viewable
using Windows NT Performance Monitor by choosing the following counter to
monitor:
<P>
<PRE>   Object: Process
   Instance: SERVICES
   Counter: Private Bytes

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During client authentication on Windows NT servers (non-Domain
Controllers), a lookup of the current Windows NT domain name is performed.
A pointer to the Windows NT domain name is saved in a global location
without freeing the previous Windows NT domain name that is already stored
there.
<P>
This memory leak problem can effect Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft SNA
Server when running on a Windows NT server. Each time an Exchange or SNA
Server client connects to the server over sockets, a small memory leak
occurs on the server. This eventually causes performance degradation and
requires a reboot to recover.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
