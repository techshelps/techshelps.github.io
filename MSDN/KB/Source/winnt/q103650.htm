<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Network connections made using the AT command are persistent for all users
on a system. The AT command runs using the System account and Schedule
service. Creating network connections under the System account makes the
connections persistent for all users who log on and log off the computer.
However, this type of connection is not saved as a normal persistent
connection. If the computer is rebooted, the connection is longer present.
<P>
Network connections made using the AT command can be removed using the
System account or by an Administrator. This type of network connection is
similar to the Common Program Groups an Administrator can create in Program
Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the Control Panel window, choose Services and start the Schedule
   service if it is not already started.

<P><LI>Create a batch file named Atnetuse.bat containing the following
   command line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NET USE W: \\servername\sharename
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use the AT command to run ATNETUSE in 5 minutes. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      AT 12:00 ATNETUSE.BAT
</PRE>
<P><LI>After ATNETUSE is run by the AT command, the persistent drive W
   will available in a Command Prompt and in File Manager.

<P><LI>Drive W is represented by a network drive button in File
   Manager, but the share name \\servername\sharename does not appear
   after W: in the drive drop down dialog box. The NET USE command
   from a Command Prompt (Cmd.exe) will not show drive W or
   \\servername\sharename, but you can use drive W as a normal network
   drive. Also, drive W is now a drive for all Users. No matter who logs
   in, everyone will get the drive W even though it is not in any user's
   persistent connections.
<P>
</OL>A user without Administrator privileges logged in with this type of
persistent connection present cannot remove the connection unless the
AT command is used.
<P>
Use one of the following methods to remove the connection:

<UL><LI>Use the AT command to schedule disconnecting the drive with a
   NET USE W: /D command.

<LI>An administrator can use the NET USE W: /D command from a Command
   Prompt.

<LI>Shut down and restart the computer.
