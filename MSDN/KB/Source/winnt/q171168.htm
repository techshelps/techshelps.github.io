<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
On your Windows NT 4.0 Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) Servers, which
are also running Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS), WINS fails to
replicate its database between the two servers and you may receive the
following event log message:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 4102
   Source:   WINS
   Description: Connection was aborted by the remote WINS

</PRE>NOTE: This is only an issue with the replication across a Demand Dial link
on the RRAS Servers.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To successfully use WINS replication across a RRAS connection, use one of
the following workarounds:

<UL><LI>Use the following steps to disable the option to Replicate Only With
   Partners:
<P>
   1. From the WINS Manager, click Server, and click Configuration.
<P>
   2. Click Advanced and clear from Replicate Only With Partners check box.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Install WINS on only one of the RRAS servers and have your other WINS
   server on a server that is on the LAN of the other RRAS.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the client-side RAS IP addresses for WINS replication as described
   in the example below:
<P>
   When two RRAS servers connect, they exchange an IP address from their
   RAS address pools. The IP address that a server receives from another
   server is considered its client-side RAS IP address.
<P>
   Server1
   RAS address pool: 200.0.1.0 subnet mask 255.255.255.0
<P>
   Server2
   RAS address pool: 200.0.2.0 subnet mask 255.255.255.0
<P>
   Each server will use the first address in its RAS pool as its server-
   side RAS IP address. When Server1 and Server2 connect, Server1 will
   receive 200.0.2.2 as its client-side IP address and Server2 will receive
   200.0.1.2 as its client-side IP address.
<P>
   To configure WINS replication between Server1 and Server2, follow these
   steps:
<P>
   On Server1
   ----------
<P>
   1. From WINS Manager, click Server, and click Replication Partners.
<P>
   2. Click Add, enter 200.0.1.2 (the client-side IP address of Server2),
<P><PRE>      and click OK.
</PRE><P>
   On Server2
   ----------
<P>
   1. From WINS Manager, click Server, and click Replication Partners.
<P>
   2. Click Add, enter 200.0.2.2 (the client-side IP address of Server2),
<P><PRE>      and click OK.
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The Show Database dialog in WINS Manager on each server will
   display the replicated RAS address with a HighestID of 0. This is
   normal.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
