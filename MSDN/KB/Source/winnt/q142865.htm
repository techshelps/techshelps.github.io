The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) for Windows NT
products because Windows NT requires greater control of the hardware (when
you compare it with other operating systems such as MS-DOS and Windows)
for security, stability and efficiency reasons. This in turn implies a
deeper knowledge and utilization on the part of the operating system of
the computer hardware. Small incompatibilities and differences from
industry standards of that hardware can have an adverse effect on the
stability of the Windows NT operating system. More information on
Windows NT and hardware is available at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/support/ntserver/hcl.asp">http://support.microsoft.com/support/ntserver/hcl.asp</A></B>

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A hardware device is unsupported if it is not listed on the HCL. Microsoft
follows the guidelines and troubleshooting steps listed below on non-HCL
equipment support issues:
<P>
Step 1: Hardware Configuration Inquiry
 

<OL><P><LI>The Microsoft support engineer asks about the hardware configuration.

<P><LI>If the hardware device is not on the Windows NT HCL, the engineer
   informs the customer that 1 incident is charged from the customer's
   service agreement (prior to troubleshooting).

<P><LI>Upon agreement, the engineer proceeds to Step 2 below. Microsoft does
   not guarantee a solution in cases with non-HCL devices.

<P><LI>If there is no agreement, where the customer feels that an incident
   should not be charged, the engineer proceeds to Step 3 below.
<P>
</OL>Step 2: Troubleshooting
 
<P>
A standard troubleshooting process is used to isolate the cause of the
problem. The following lists some of the resources and steps that the
Microsoft support engineers uses, which is also available to you:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Knowledge Base is available to customers through Microsoft
   TechNet and Microsoft World Wide Web (WWW) site at:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B><A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/support/">http://support.microsoft.com/support/</A></B>
</PRE>
<LI>Determine if the problem occurs on supported hardware device.

<LI>Check hardware and/or driver configuration by removing unsupported (or
   suspected) components (for example: adapter cards and video cards).
   Issues that relate to unsupported systems and motherboards cannot be
   approached in this fashion.
<P>
</UL>During the course of troubleshooting, if the problem is isolated to a
non-HCL device, the engineer proceeds to Step 3 below and closes the call
(incident).
<P>
If there is no solution to the problem, the engineer explains the reason
and recommends constructive alternatives, such as one or all of the
following:

<UL><LI>The engineer offers the phone and Bulletin Board Service (BBS) number
   for the motherboard, adapter card or other device manufacturer, if
   available, so that the customer can ask for troubleshooting suggestions
   and possible updated third-party drivers.

<LI>The engineer may recommend that the customer request the hardware
   vendor to attempt the installation of Windows NT on the system or
   configure it in such a way that Windows NT becomes stable and
   functional.

<LI>The engineer informs the customer of BIOS or firmware updates. Some
   information on the update is available in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
<P>
</UL><h3>Step 3 : Alternative Resources</h3>
 
<P>
Enterprise Customer Unit (ECU) policy, in regards to a Windows NT failure
related to Non-HCL hardware, is for the engineer to fax the following
Knowledge Base article to the customer:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q126690.htm">Q126690</A></B>
   TITLE:      Windows NT 4.0 Setup Troubleshooting Guide

   -or-

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q139733.htm">Q139733</A></B>
   TITLE     : Windows NT 3.5x Setup Troubleshooting Guide

</PRE></OL>Alternatively, the engineer can provide information on the location of the
same file(s) and where they can be downloaded (Microsoft WWW server, FTP
server, and Microsoft Download Library). If the customer elects to bypass
Step 2 (does not wish to be charged for 1 incident), then the customer may
attempt to resolve the issue without charge using the troubleshooting
documents mentioned above. If the customer wishes to proceed with an
incident charge even after completing Step 2, the engineer can inform the
customer of the Microsoft Consulting Line at (800) 936-1565.
<P>
<P><h3>Server Down or Data Loss Issues</h3>
 
<P>
There is a possibility that an installation or upgrade of the Windows NT
operating system on unsupported hardware results in loss of some operating
system functionality or data. In cases where the previous operating system
has been Windows NT or another Microsoft operating system (such as MS-DOS,
Windows 3.1x, Windows 95, OS/2 1.3), the engineer determines if the issue
is a problem with the operating system or non-HCL hardware related. If the
problem is the operating system, the engineer will file a report and
evaluate the problem to provide a fix. The engineer will also attempt to
recover the system.
<P>
If the problem is related to hardware incompatibility, the customer will
need to restore the previous operating system and data from backup. If the
customer does not have a backup of the previous operating system, the
support engineer will assist the customer in installing only the previous,
working operating system. This does not include other drive file
structures, data or security, or any other previous operating system
settings. The engineer will then refer the customer to the Microsoft
Consulting Line for any further file structure (not data) recovery, domain
configuration (user accounts, trust, shares, printers, replication)
recovery, as applicable.
<P>
In cases where the previous operating system is not a Microsoft operating
system (for example: Power PC system with AIX, OS/2 or Macintosh operating
system), Microsoft cannot assist customers in the recovery of their
system. Requisite knowledge and experience to perform recovery on non-
Microsoft operating systems do not exist in Microsoft Product Support
Services.
