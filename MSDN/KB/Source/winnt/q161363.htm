The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The compact disc distribution of Service Pack 2 for Windows NT 4.0 now
contains a driver for the Crystal Semiconductor CS4232/CS4236 Plug and Play
Sound Card. For more information, see the Readme.txt file on the compact
disc in the directory Drvlib\Audio\Crystal. This article describes how to
install the driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are installing the driver on a Toshiba Tecra 720/730 or Motorola
Powerstack II computer, install the driver as a legacy audio driver. (If
you are not installing the driver on one of these computers, skip to the
first line after step 5 immediately below.) To install the driver as a
legacy audio driver for use with the specified Toshiba and Motorola
computers, complete the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Multimedia Control Panel.

<P><LI>Choose the Devices tab and click the Add button.

<P><LI>Select Unlisted or Updated Driver.

<P><LI>Point to the Oemsetup.inf in the proper processor architecture
   directory. For example, when installing on a Toshiba laptop, choose the
   Oemsetup.inf file in the Drvlib\Audio\Crystal\I386 directory.

<P><LI>Complete the installation procedure by skipping to step 1 immediately
   below and following the steps listed.
<P>
</OL>If you are installing the Plug and Play driver on any computer besides the
above-specified Tecra and Motorola models, you need to ensure that the Plug
and Play ISA Enabler is installed. Information on how to install the PnP
ISA Enabler can be found in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q156344.htm">Q156344</A></B>
   TITLE     : Plug and Play Devices Not Detected or Installed

</PRE></OL>After the Plug and Play ISA Enabler is installed (or if are installing the
Plug and Play driver on one of the above-specified Tecra or Motorola
computers), use the following steps to install the sound driver.

<OL><P><LI>Log on to your computer with Administrator privileges.

<P><LI>The words "New Hardware Found" will appear and then you will be prompted
   to install drivers for several functions on your card.

<P><LI>Select the option "Driver from disk provided by hardware manufacturer."

<P><LI>Enter the path name for the CS423x driver as in step 4 above.

<P><LI>On the Select Device screen, select OK.

<P><LI>If you are not presented with resource settings, select Manual
   Configuration.

<P><LI>If there are any conflicting devices at the bottom of the screen,
   perform one of the following two procedures:
<P>
   a. Resolve the devices by selecting a basic configuration that allows
   the selection of resources that do not conflict with devices already
   installed
<P>
   -or-
<P>
   b. Change the resources settings. To do this, performing the following
   steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>      1) Highlight the setting to be changed in the Resource Settings
<PRE></PRE>         window.

      2) Click Change Setting, and select a setting that does not conflict
         with another device.

      3) When finished, select OK.

      4) Repeat for any settings that show a conflict.

</PRE><P><LI>If prompted for Crystal Semiconductor MPU-401 Driver, select "Windows NT
   default driver."
<P>
   NOTE: The MPU-401 driver requires a Basic Configuration that includes an
   interrupt value. The driver will fail to load if no interrupt is
   assigned to the driver.

<P><LI>If prompted for Crystal Semiconductor Control Base, select "Windows NT
   default driver."

<P><LI>If prompted for Microsoft Joystick Port Enabler, select "Windows NT
   default driver."

<P><LI>If prompted for Crystal CS4232 or CS4236 Sound Chip (compact disc),
   select "Do not install a driver (Windows NT will not prompt you again)."

<P><LI>If prompted for an IDE CD-ROM or Hard Disk Controller, select "Do not
   install a driver (Windows NT will not prompt you again)."

<P><LI>When prompted, restart your computer.
<P>
</OL>At this point, your Crystal Semiconductor CS423x card should work properly.
If you need to change the resources that your card uses, open the
Multimedia tool in Control Panel, select the Devices tab, select Properties
for the Crystal Semiconductor driver, and click the Settings button. This
will bring up the same resource-picking dialog box that was invoked during
installation of the device.
<P>
NOTE: This driver supports only the CS4232 and CS4236 cards completely. The
SRS and QSound capabilities of the CS4237 and CS4238, respectively, are not
being supported at this time. The CS4231 chip is also not supported by this
driver. There is, at this time, no Plug and Play support for the Crystal
Semiconductor Standard IDE Controller.
