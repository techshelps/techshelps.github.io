<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Occasionally, stopping the Windows Internet Name Service (Wins) Service
hangs with a "Stop Pending" status. This occurs when typing NET STOP WINS
or when using the Windows NT Scheduling service (AT) to stop WINS. The
result is that the service fails to shut down as requested. While in this
state the following condition exists:
<P>
<PRE>  - NET START WINS command (from an MS-DOS Command Prompt)
    returns the message:

      The requested service has already been started. More help is
      available by typing NET HELPMSG 2182.

      NET HELPMSG 2182 displays the following:
      The requested service has already been started.

</PRE>- NET STOP WINS command (from an MS-DOS Command Prompt returns the
<PRE>  message:

      The service could not be controlled in its present state. More help
      is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2189.

      NET HELPMSG 2189 displays the following:
      The service could not be controlled in its present state.

</PRE>NOTE: Similar results are returned by using, "SRVMGR \\&lt;server_name&gt;" and
<PRE>      then selecting Services. Attempting to start the WINS service
      returns error 2182. The option to stop the WINS Service is not
      available (grayed out).

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The WINS service shutdown is waiting for the return of one or more
outstanding threads. This results in a continuous wait because the service
cannot currently accept requests. For example, if the service is just
starting, it cannot process requests until it is fully started.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Try the operation again in a minute or two. If this problem persists, the
service may be stuck in a partially running state. Contact technical
support. Be prepared to give the name of the service and other information
about the system, such as the services and applications that were running,
and the type and amount of network activity on the computer at the time of
the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has corrected the problem and modified the files, WINS.EXE and
WINSEVNT.DLL in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.
