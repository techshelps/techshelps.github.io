The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you print to a Kyocera F-800 or F-800a, there will be TrueType fonts
randomly missing throughout a document. The behavior is consistent when you
print the same document, but characters may be dropped when you print new
documents. You will be unable to predict which characters will drop when
you print different documents. The problem does not seem to occur with
TrueType fonts 12 points and greater, but consistently occurs with smaller
fonts. There also appears to be a second problem where the first character
downloaded does not print. The same character will not print if it appears
later in the document. This behavior does not exist in Windows 3.1 because
TrueType downloading is handled differently.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Workstation and Server
version 3.5.
<P>
You might be able to work around the first problem by installing more
printer memory or printing TrueType fonts as graphics (to do this in
Windows NT, do not select the Download TrueType fonts option in Printer
Setup from within the specific application). You might also avoid the
problem by using larger TrueType fonts. (greater than 11 points) or by
resetting the printer.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT  and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in Windows NT
Workstation or Server version 3.5.
<P>
The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
