The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When receiving an RPC packet from a Big Endian computer, an access
violation in RPCRT4.DLL occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This access violation is caused by a union structure that was incorrectly
decoded on the Little Endian Windows NT computer. When Windows NT cannot
decode such a structure, it leaves it in the original Big Endian format.
<P>
A union is a 'C' structure which lets you assign multiple names and/or
types to the same address space. For instance, you can define a union
containing an integer and a string pointer. Each member shares the same
location in memory. If you set the string equal to an address, and then
print the integer portion, you would get the address of the string. Each of
these members (the integer and string pointer) is known as an ARM of the
union.
<P>
When RPC communication comes from a Big Endian computer, Windows NT must
convert the information to Little Endian format on an x86 computer. For
example, a unicode string has the length passed. A DWORD length of 9 is
passed as 0x09000000 on a Little Endian computer, but as 0x00000009 on a
Big Endian computer.
<P>
When a data structure is passed in an RPC call, information describing the
type of data, and offset to pointers is passed as well. In the case of the
GP fault, a union structure is passed to Windows NT from a Big Endian
computer. While decoding the information, it incorrectly increments a
pointer into the RPC data for the union structure. This causes it to ignore
the translation from Big Endian to Little Endian and leaves a unicode
string in big endian format. This causes a problem decoding the string
because the length of the unicode string is not reversed, and therefore
looks like a huge number. This causes an Access Violation when it tries to
access passed the unicode strings end.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack.
