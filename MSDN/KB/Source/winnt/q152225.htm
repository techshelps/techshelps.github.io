<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In some instances, it may be desirable or necessary to have all Help files
together in a common directory rather than in individual default storage
locations (such as the system root directory for the Help files shipped
with Windows NT or the application root directory for the Help files
shipped with various Windows applications).
<P>
If you move only the .hlp files to the new common directory, their
associated .gid files are created and/or updated in the original directory
and not in the new common directory, because Windows NT Help creates and/or
updates the .gid files based on the location of their associated .cnt
files.
<P>
To ensure that the .gid files are updated in the new common directory, move
the related .cnt files to the new common directory and either move the
current .gid files to the new common directory (in which case they are
updated in the common directory) or delete them from the original directory
(in which case they will be re-created in the new common directory).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT 3.51 uses a Help engine based on the Windows 95 Help engine.
With this Help engine comes the implementation of several new support files
(listed below) in addition to the standard Help files (.hlp).
<P>
<P><h3>FTS</h3>
 
<P>
Files of this type contain key words and/or phrases for full-text search
queries. If such a file does not exist for the base Help file being opened
by Help, you are prompted to create one by the Find Setup Wizard.
<P>
<P><h3>CNT</h3>
 
<P>
Files of this type enable the use of multiple help file grouping for the
Help Topics dialog box by providing the indexes to the relevant Help files.
<P>
<P><h3>FTG</h3>
 
<P>
Files of this type are generated by the Help engine when a Help file is
opened for which a .cnt file exists. They contain the data necessary for
cross-file, full-text Help file searches.
<P>
<P><h3>GID</h3>
 
<P>
Files of this type are hidden files generated by the Help engine when a
search is performed in a Help file. These .gid files contain the indexes
displayed on the Index tab of the Help Topics dialog box.
<P>
NOTE: Files of the type .ind (full text search index), used by earlier
versions of Windows NT Help, are no longer used or supported by the new
Help engine.
<P>
To ensure that all Help-related files are in a common directory, move all
of the above defined files, along with the .hlp files, to the new location
(with the possible exception of the .gid files, which can be deleted, as
noted in the Summary section above).
<P>
NOTE: To ensure that Windows NT Help can locate these files in their new
location, update the path environment variable to include the new common
directory, by using the System Control Panel.
