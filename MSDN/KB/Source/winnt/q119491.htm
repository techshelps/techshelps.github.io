The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5, you can use
the Disk Administrator to create and delete partitions without rebooting
the computer. However, if you delete a partition and File Manager is
running, even after a screen refresh, the partition (drive letter) will
still be displayed as available in File Manager, even though it has
actually been deleted.
<P>
If you select a drive (partition) in File Manager which has been deleted by
the Disk Administrator, one of the following errors will occur:

<UL><LI>If Commit Changes Now has not been selected, an "Access Denied" error
   message appears if you try to access the drive. If you  open the drive
   in File Manager, the following message appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      You do not have permission to access this directory.
</PRE>
<LI>If Commit Changes Now has been selected, the following error message
   appears if you try to access the drive:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Error Selecting Drive
      The device is not ready.
</PRE><P>
</UL>If Commit Changes Now is not selected, even if File Manager is refreshed,
it continues to display the drive as if it is available, but access is
always denied. Once Commit Changes Now has completed, in order for File
Manager to not display the deleted partition, it must be restarted.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Windows NT version 3.5.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
