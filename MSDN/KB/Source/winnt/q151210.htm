<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains questions and answers regarding the different types
of socket application supported by MS-DOS and the Microsoft Windows
operating system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
What is a socket application?
<P>
A socket interface was first provided with Berkeley UNIX (BSD) in the
eighties. It was designed as a network interprocess communication (IPC)
mechanism for the built-in TCP/IP. A socket defines a bi-directional end
point for combination between processes.
<P>
A socket has three primary components:
<P>
<PRE>   The interface to which it is bound
   The port number to which it will send or receive data
   The type of socket--either stream or datagram

</PRE>In TCP/IP, the interface is the IP address of the host. The port number is
the software process address. In IPX/SPX, the interface is the combination
of the IPX network ID and the MAC address of the network interface. The
port number is the software process address (IPX socket number).
<P>
A server application listens on a well-known port over all installed
network interfaces. A client generally initiates communication from a
specific interface from any available port.
<P>
What is Windows Sockets?
<P>
The Windows Socket (WinSock) specification defines a network programming
interface for Microsoft Windows that is based on the Socket interface
popularized in Berkeley Unix. The WinSock API is a library of functions
that implement the Windows Socket specification. WinSock augments the
Berkeley socket implementation by adding Windows-specific extensions to
support the message-driven nature of Windows operating systems.
<P>
There are a few other proprietary windows socket APIs (WSOCKETS, and
WIN_SOCK). For more information see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q98599.htm">Q98599</A></B>
   Title:      Differences Among WIN_SOCK.DLL, WSOCKETS.DLL, and
               WINSOCK.DLL

</PRE>These are not encouraged APIs and do NOT implement the Windows Sockets
API standard.
<P>
What is WINSOCK.DLL?
<P>
WINSOCK.DLL is  a dynamic-link library (DLL) that provides Windows Sockets
version 1.1 API for TCP/IP Windows Socket applications. WINSOCK.DLL is
offered in current version of all Microsoft TCP/IP stacks:
<P>
<PRE>   MS-DOS TCP/IP for Lanman 2.2C
   MS-DOS TCP/IP for Microsoft Network 3.0 Clients
   Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows for Workgroups
   Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups
   Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows NT 3.5x
   Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows 95

</PRE>For additional information about Microsoft TCP/IP protocol comparison, see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A HREF="../CROSSNET/Q94069.htm">Q94069</A></B>
   Title:      Microsoft TCP/IP Protocol Comparison and FAQ

</PRE>What version of the WinSock specification does WINSOCK.DLL comply with?
<P>
Microsoft WINSOCK.DLL complies with Windows Socket Specification version
1.1. Support for previous versions of the Sockets specification is not
provided. WINSOCK.DLL does not provide support for Raw Sockets(SOCK_RAW),
DOS Sockets, or vendor-specific implementations.
<P>
For instruction about downloading the WinSock specification from
Microsoft, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN32SDK/Q85965.htm">Q85965</A></B>
   Title:      Microsoft Socket API Specification version

</PRE>What is WSOCK32.DLL?
<P>
WSOCK32.DLL is a dynamic-link library (DLL) that provides Windows Sockets
API for 32-bit TCP/IP Windows Socket applications and 32-bit IPX/SPX
Windows Socket Applications. WSOCK32.DLL is offered in Windows NT and 95.
<P>
Can Microsoft WINSOCK.DLL be used with third-party TCP/IP stacks?
<P>
No. WINSOCK.DLL and WSOCK32.DLL will be provided by the vendor providing
the TCP/IP stack. The DLL and the protocol stack implementation cannot be
mixed and matched with other TCP/IP and DLL implementations. For example,
you cannot use WINSOCK.DLL provided by Microsoft with FTP's TCP/IP stack or
vice versa.
<P>
What type of Socket applications are supported by MS-DOS TCP/IP stacks?
<P>
MS-DOS TCP/IP for Lanman 2.2c and Microsoft Network Clients 3.0 support DOS
Socket application and WinSock 1.1 application. Sockets.exe in MS-DOS
TCP/IP is a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program; it allows MS-DOS
socket applications to run if they've been written with the Microsoft
TCP/IP Sockets Development Kit Version 1.0, using the DOS Socket Library
(DOS_SOCK.LIB) available in the Development Kit. WSOCKETS.DLL is provided
in Lanman 2.2 SDK to make Windows calls look as identical as they do in MS-
DOS.
<P>
The SOCKETS.EXE and WSOCKETS.DLL do NOT implement the Windows Sockets API
standard.
<P>
In order for a Windows Socket application to function with MS-DOS TCP/IP,
SOCKETS.EXE must be loaded before Windows startup and WINSOCK.DLL must
exist in the application search path.
<P>
Is it possible to run a 32-bit Windows Socket application with Windows
3.x?
<P>
Yes. Win32s 1.1 contains a thunking layer that converts 32-bit Windows
Sockets calls (using WSOCK32.DLL) to 16-bit Windows Sockets calls (using
WINSOCK.DLL).
<P>
<P>
Does a Windows Sockets application work over any protocols other than
TCP/IP?
<P>
Yes. In Windows NT and 95, sockets support is also extended to IPX/SPX.
Both 16-bit and 32-bit IPX/SPX Windows sockets are supported over NWLINK in
Windows NT and 95.
<P>
<P>
Does MS Network Client 3.0 support MS-DOS/Windows IPX/SPX Socket
applications?
<P>
No. MS-DOS/Windows IPX/SPX Socket applications running in a Virtual machine
of Windows 95 can be interfaced with NWLINK via WSOCK.VXD.  WSOCK.VXD
supports 16-bit Windows Sockets application over 32-bit TCP/IP and IPX/SPX
Windows Socket.
