<P>
This article explains the 1024-cylinder limitation on Enhanced Small
Device Interface (ESDI) and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)
drives.
<P>
ESDI uses cylinder, head, sector (CHS) addressing and has a
1024-cylinder limitation. Some controller cards can work around this
by implementing a translation scheme in the onboard controller BIOS.
Windows NT (and other protected mode operating systems) must duplicate
the code found in these BIOS chips to duplicate this behavior.
Unfortunately, there are many ways to perform this translation and to
accommodate them all Microsoft would have to incorporate all of these
schemes in the standard AT disk driver. (Microsoft has NOT included
support for all known ESDI-translation schemes.)
<P>
Some ESDI controllers implement this translation in hardware; thus, it
is totally transparent to the system. This allows the standard driver
to work unchanged. Consult your controller documentation to see if
such translation is performed by the BIOS or the hardware.
<P>
SCSI uses relative block address (RBA) addressing. Normally, you do
not have to worry about a 1024-cylinder limit with SCSI until the SCSI
drive becomes very large (that is, greater than 1 gigabyte [GB]). At
that point there may be a problem. Some SCSI cards have a jumper for
greater than 1 GB support. Refer to your hardware documentation to
determine if your card has this jumper.
