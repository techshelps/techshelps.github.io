<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are connected directly to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) network
printer using Data Link Control (DLC), you may not be able to print if
another workstation is connected to the same printer and it is
configured to use Continuous Timers.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If a workstation is connected to an HP network printer and is using
Continuous as the Timer, it will not relinquish the printer after
printing and other workstations cannot print even though they are
connected.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow the procedure below for each
workstation connected to the HP network printer:

<OL><P><LI>Start Print Manager and select the network printer.

<P><LI>Select Printer Properties. In the Hewlett-Packard Network Peripheral
   Port dialog box, select Timers.

<P><LI>Change the setting to Job Based instead of Continuous. The default
   is Continuous with 60 sec Time Interval.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Job Based option breaks the connection between available
workstations and the printer after each job. This allows several
workstations on the network to use the HPMON.DLL printer driver to
print directly to a network-connected peripheral.
<P>
The Continuous option does not break the connection between the server
and the printer. It is possible to set up a Print Server so that
workstations that want to print to the DLC printer must use the shared
printer defined on the server. This allows the network administrator
to maintain one workstation as a print server so that other
workstations do not have to have the HPMON.DLL printer driver
installed.
<P>
NOTE: On a single LAN, only one of these methods should be used. If
one workstation is configured for Job Based (as is the HP Monitor
utility for Windows for Workgroups), while another workstation is
configured for Continuous, the workstation using the Job Based
configuration will be unable to print after the workstation using
Continuous has printed.
