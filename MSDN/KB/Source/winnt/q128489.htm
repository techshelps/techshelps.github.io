<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Trust relationships may be established between domains so that they may
share user account information. A secure channel is established between a
domain controller (DC) in the trusting domain and a domain controller in
the trusted domain. The secure channel ensures that only servers with the
proper access rights can send and receive privileged information.
Primarily, the trusting DC uses the secure channel to pass validation
requests to the trusted domain controller.
<P>
This article contains information on the accounts used to create and
maintain the secure channel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The accounts and procedures used in a trusted domain relationship are
discussed in this article. Similar accounts and procedures are used in the
trust relationship between a primary domain controller (PDC) and a backup
domain controller (BDC), and between a Windows NT DC and a Windows NT
Workstation in the domain.
<P>
For simplicity, the trusted domain is referred to as MASTER and the
trusting domain is referred to as RESOURCE. The trusted domain, MASTER,
contains the user account information. RESOURCE is the trusting domain; it
trusts MASTER to validate user access to its resources.
<P>
On each Domain Controller in RESOURCE, the existence of the trust is
represented by an LSA trusted domain object. It contains the name of the
trusted domain and the domain security ID (SID). The LSA trusted domain
object is replicated from the trusting domain PDC to each of the BDCs in
the trusting domain.
<P>
On each DC in RESOURCE, a password is stored in an LSA secret object
G$$&lt;TrustedDomainName&gt; (for example, G$$MASTER). This object is stored in
the registry key HKEY_Local_Machine\Security\Policy\Secrets. The LSA secret
object for the trusted domain trust relationship is replicated from the
trusting domain PDC to each of the trusting domain BDCs.
<P>
On each DC in MASTER, the password is stored in a SAM user account marked
as INTERDOMAIN_TRUST_ACCOUNT (for example, RESOURCE$). This can be viewed
in the registry path \SAM\SAM\Domains\Account\Users\Names
(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree). This account is replicated from the trusted
domain PDC to each of the trusted domain BDCs.
<P>
These accounts are created when a trust is initially established. The
administrator of the trusted domain, MASTER, uses User Manager to permit
RESOURCE to trust MASTER's accounts. When the domain is added in the Permit
to Trust dialog, a password is provided by the administrator. At this time,
a hidden user account is created in the SAM for the trusting domain. The
account contains the specified password (for example, RESOURCE$).
<P>
The administrator of the trusting domain then establishes the trust. The
administrator provides the password specified earlier. User Manager creates
the LSA secret object. The server in RESOURCE attempts to setup a session
with the DC in MASTER using the account RESOURCE$. The DC controller in
MASTER responds with the error "0xc0000198, Status_Nologon_Interdomain_
Trust_Account" because the special Inter-Domain Trust Account cannot be
used in a normal session logon. The session request fails because of this
condition.
<P>
This error is informative to the DC in the RESOURCE domain. Receiving this
error indicates that the trust account exists and a trust is possible. Upon
receiving that response, it establishes a null session and then uses RPC
transactions to use remote API calls that establish the trusted domain
relationship. A secure channel is set up later by the netlogon service in
the trust domain using the trust information that was stored by the user
manager.
<P>
After the trust is established, the RESOURCE PDC changes the trusted domain
object password. The procedure for this is detailed below. All DCs in each
domain receive the trust account objects through normal intra-domain
synchronization of the SAM and the LSA databases. The DCs in RESOURCE
receive the LSA secret object during the update of the LSA database, and
the DCs in MASTER receive the account in the SAM update. With these
objects, any DC in the trusting domain can set up a secure channel to any
DC in the trusted domain.
<P>
Maintenance of these accounts consists of periodic password changes. Every
seven days the PDC of the trusting domain changes the password of the
trusted domain object. It does this by:

<OL><P><LI>Picking a new password.

<P><LI>Setting the OldPassword field of the LSA secret object to the
   previous NewPassword field.

<P><LI>Setting the NewPassword field to the LSA secret object to the
   password picked in step 1. This allows the DCs to always have a
   password around that works in the event of a crash.

<P><LI>Remoting an I_NetServerPasswordSet RPC call to a DC of the trusted
   domain asking it to set the password on the SAM user trust account to
   the value picked in step 1. The trusting PDC remotes the RPC call to
   whatever trusted DC it has the secure channel with. That machine
   passes the request through to the trusted PDC.
<P>
</OL>The password is now changed on both PDCs. Normal replication distributes
the objects to the BDCs.
<P>
A domain controller of the trusted domain (MASTER) never initiates the
password change; it is always initiated by the trusting domain PDC.
<P>
It is possible, but not likely, that the trusting domain DC will change the
password without updating a DC in the trusted domain. Initiating the
password change requires that the secure channel has been set up. It is
remotely possible that the trusted side my have gone down at some point
during the process and not received the updated password. For this reason,
both the old and new passwords are kept in the LSA Secret object on the
trusting side. Additionally, the PDC in the trusting domain never changes
the new password unless it has successfully authenticated (set up a secure
channel) using the current new password.
<P>
If authentication fails using the new password because the password is
invalid, the trusting PDC tries the old password. If it authenticates
successfully with the old password, it immediately (within 15 minutes)
continues the password change algorithm with step 4 (above). It does not
start over with step 1 because that might lead to problems where role
changes have occurred.
