<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows NT, if you are using a POSIX application, you must have
Execute (X) permissions to a directory in order for the POSIX
application to be able to view that directory's files. Also, for the
best performance of POSIX applications, it is recommended that the
Bypass Traverse Checking Right option be enabled.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Under POSIX, there are three types of permissions and three groups are
assigned to these permissions. The permissions are R (read) W (write)
and X (execute). The three groups are Owner, Group, and Everyone. The
permissions are displayed in the following manner for files and
directories respectively (using the UNIX directory command, ls -l):
<P>
<PRE>   -rwxrwxrwx    1 Everyone Everyone    35328 Jul  8 14:25 AR.EXE

   drwxrwxrwx    1 Everyone Everyone    0     Aug 27 13:45 DEFAULT

   NOTE: The first bit is left blank for files and is set to "d" for
   directories.

</PRE>The preceding 9 bits (after the directory bit) are used to set read
write and execute permissions for the three groups as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   - rwx  rwx  rwx
     |__| |__| |__|
      |    |    |
   Owner Group Everyone

</PRE>The Execute bit (X) is required to be set for the group the user
belongs to in order for that group's users to have access to a
directory. The reason execute permissions are required on directories
relates to the design of UNIX file systems. The Execute permission is
set to allow users to view the contents of a directory. Because the
UNIX file system knows that directories are not executable, it uses
the Execute bit only for allowing access inside the directory. This is
nothing more than a definition; it is a way of stating that users are
allowed to enter directories.
<P>
If POSIX applications are running slowly, verify that the user or
their group has the Bypass Traverse Checking Right with the User
Manager. By default, everyone has the right to Bypass Traverse
Checking.
<P>
POSIX on Windows NT uses execute permissions the same way UNIX systems
do, as does Microsoft Win32, on Windows NT. The Bypass Traverse
Checking privilege means that permissions will only be checked on the
last component of a path and not on the directory names preceding it.
This feature is useful when performance is more important than
security. If additional security is desired, this right can be
removed.
