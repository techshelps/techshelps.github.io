<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a 16-bit application running under Window NT opens a file as a named
pipe, subsequent reads from that file can result in an access violation
(AV) in the WOW subsystem.
<P>
In the third-party test code that exposed this bug, a call to _lread()
failed. (This is a valid possibility; in this case, for example, there was
no data available at the pipe.) However, rather than return the standard
failure code of HFILE_ERROR (-1), a garbage value was returned, indicating
success. When processing was attempted using the garbage data extracted
from the buffer returned by the lread() call, an AV occurred.
<P>
CAUSE
 
<P>
The file was opened as a named pipe under the WOW subsystem, but the DOS
SFT_ flags in the file handle were not marked to indicate that the handle
was for a named pipe. (When _lread() fails under the WOW subsystem, the
DOS subsystem will make an attempt to carry out the read operation before
returning failure to the application.) When the read-file operation failed
in WOW, the DOS emulation layer incorrectly determined that, since the
named pipe flag wasn't set for the handle, it would deal with the handle
as with a disk-based file, leading to the unexpected result.
<P>
RESOLUTION
 
<P>
To solve this problem the WOW code was fixed. When a named pipe file is
opened/created, the named pipe bit is now set in the file handle.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5,
3.51, and 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows
NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack,
