<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A Windows Socket (WinSock) application fails to receive data from a remote
server. It may display a message indicating that a Connection Reset message
or a WSAECONNRESET event occurred.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Under certain circumstances, a condition exists with Microsoft TCP/IP where
a TCP packet can be sent on a connection that has already closed causing a
Reset packet to be issued. This causes the WinSock application to fail with
a WSAECONNRESET event.
<P>
Detailed Explanation:
<P>
In a normal WinSock client-server TCP/IP communication sequence, the
following type of conversation could be observed with a Network Monitor
product.
<P>
<PRE>   CLIENT               SERVER
   ======               ======
   SYN         --&gt;
            &lt;--      SYN - ACK
   ACK         --&gt;

   TCP (Data - request) --&gt;
            &lt;--      ACK

            &lt;--      TCP (Data - response)
   ACK         --&gt;

      ... potentially many Data/Ack response packets ...

   FIN         --&gt;
            &lt;--      ACK
            &lt;--      FIN
   ACK         --&gt;

</PRE>When the final FIN packet is sent by the server, and the ACK packet
returns, the server is free to close the socket created for the client
communication. In this instance, the client initiated the closing of
communications, followed by the server.
<P>
In a WinSock client-server TCP/IP communication sequence that exposes the
Connection Reset problem, the following type of conversation could be
observed with a Network Monitor product.
<P>
<PRE>   CLIENT               SERVER
   ======               ======
   SYN         --&gt;
            &lt;--      SYN - ACK
   ACK         --&gt;

   TCP (Data - request) --&gt;
            &lt;--      ACK

   FIN         --&gt;
            &lt;--      ACK

            &lt;--      TCP (Data - response)
   ACK         --&gt;

      ... potentially many Data/Ack response packets ...

            &lt;--      FIN
   ACK         --&gt;

   ACK (this is bad) --&gt;

            &lt;--      RESET
   ACK         --&gt;

</PRE>In the problem scenario above, the following events transpired. The client
issues a Shutdown on their local socket after they sent the request to the
server, notifying the socket that it will not be sending any more data.
This causes a FIN packet to be sent very early in the conversation (this is
perfectly legitimate programming style). Later, the server issues a FIN to
indicate it is done sending data, and the client acknowledges the FIN
packet. Due to the way that Delayed Acknowledgments worked, it was possible
for another ACK to be sent to the server after the ACK for the FIN packet.
If the server has already closed the socket it was communicating with the
client on, this will generate a RESET packet to the client.
<P>
If the client was still reading data, the RESET packet will cause the
client read of data to return in error with a WSAECONNRESET, indicating
that the connection was reset.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, install the fix mentioned below.
<P>
Obtain the fix mentioned below or wait for the next Windows NT Service
Pack.
<P>
The fix was to modify TCPIP.SYS to not send an acknowledgment if an
acknowledgment was already sent for a FIN packet.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Windows NT version 3.51.
This problem was corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
Workstation or Server version 3.51. For information on obtaining this
update, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
