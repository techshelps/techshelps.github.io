The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>U.S. Service Pack 1 for Microsoft Windows NT and Windows NT
   Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you update Windows NT with U.S. Service Pack 1 and attempt to
add the driver for the DayStar Digital LocalTalk Adapter, or attempt
to configure this adapter if it had already been installed prior to
applying the patch, you will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   An Internal Error Occurred - Contact Technical Support

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During installation of the driver for the DayStar Digital LocalTalk
Adapter, you must specify which I/O address the adapter is using.
After you select the proper address and choose OK, the above error
message will be generated if U.S. Service Pack 1 has been installed.
If the driver was installed under the initial release of Windows NT,
and then the U.S. Service Pack 1 patch was applied, when you attempt
to change the adapter's configuration through the Network application
of Control Panel, the error message will also be generated.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The only resolution currently is to remove the modifications made by
the U.S. Service Pack 1, and then the installation/configuration of
the driver will be successful. You can do this by using the Emergency
Repair Disk and doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>Start your system using Disk 1 - Setup Disk for Floppy Disk
   Installation, or the CD-ROM Installation Disk 1 if Windows NT was
   installed from CD-ROM.

<P><LI>At the first blue screen, press R for Repair.

<P><LI>When prompted to do so, insert the Emergency Repair Disk that
   was originally created for this computer.

<P><LI>Reinsert Disk 1 when prompted. (This is the same disk with which
   you started your system.)

<P><LI>You will see three selections. All three will be selected by
   default. Use the ARROW KEYS to move the selector bar and use the
   SPACEBAR  to highlight/select or clear the options.

<P><LI>Clear the selection of all options except "Verify Windows NT
   system files." This should be the only option that has an "X"
   in front of it. Move the selector bar to the line that says
   to Continue and press the ENTER key.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows
NT Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
