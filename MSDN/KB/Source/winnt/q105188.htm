<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Kodak Multisession Photo CD support has been designed into the
Microsoft Windows NT operating system. The requirements for using
Kodak Multisession Photo CD in the Windows NT environment depends on
how the manufacturer of the CD-ROM drive has implemented Photo CD in
their firmware.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In an effort to help facilitate the compatibility of a Kodak
Multisession Photo CD with Windows NT and future Windows operating
systems, Microsoft is distributing a document to CD-ROM drive
manufacturers (READTOC.DOC) that will help outline the necessary
details to enable this compatibility through the Read TOC command.
<P>
If a drive's firmware implements the Read TOC command as outlined in
this document and the drive is listed in the Windows NT Hardware
Compatibility List, then no additional drivers will be needed to
access Kodak Multisession Photo CD in the Windows NT environment.
Also, any SCSI interface adapter listed in the Windows NT Hardware
Compatibility List should support this process.
<P>
If a drive's firmware does not or cannot implement the Read TOC
Command in the manner described in this document, then a filter driver
will need to be written to enable CD-ROM drives to be
multisession-capable in Microsoft Windows NT.
<P>
The following CD-ROM drives are known to be compatible with the Kodak
Multisession Photo CD support designed in Windows NT:
<P>
<PRE>   Sony CDU-561, CDU-31a
   Texel DM-5024 or Plextor DM-5024
   NEC CDR-74-1

</PRE>The following CD-ROM drive is known to not be compatible:
<P>
<PRE>   Toshiba 3401

</PRE>If other manufacturers have used the same Kodak Multisession Photo CD
implementation in their firmware as that used by Sony, then their
drives would also be compatible.
<P>
The manufacturer of the CD-ROM drive should be contacted to determine
the compatibility of a specific drive and availability of a filter
driver for Windows NT if needed.
<P>

Microsoft Knowledge Base:
