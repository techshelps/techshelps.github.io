The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Directory Replication fails to replicate to import servers. An export
server will successfully replicate to itself, even though it may report
errors.
<P>
The Windows NT Event Log on the export server records the following event:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 3216
   Source: REPLICATOR
   System error 5 has occurred.

</PRE>The Windows NT Event Log on the import server may record one or both of the
following events:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 3216
   Source: REPLICATOR
   System error 2116 has occurred.

   Event ID: 3208
   Source: REPLICATOR
   The replication service could not update directory &lt;name&gt; from source
   on &lt;export server name&gt; due to error &lt;error number&gt;.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows NT 4.0, a new feature was introduced to restrict remote users
from accessing a computer's registry unless the administrator of that
computer explicitly grants the remote user access by setting the permission
on a new registry key. This can prevent directory replication.
<P>
When the replication interval passes, the import computer reads the
registry of the export server to determine replication parameters. By
default, only the Administrators group has permission to remotely access
the registry. If no other groups or users were specified in the access
control list, or if the registry path is not specified as an allowed path,
the account used for replication is denied access and replication fails.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
For Directory Replication to work properly, an explicit user account must
be used. Using the System account will fail. For more information on how to
create an explicit user account for Directory Replication, see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Quick Directory Replication Troubleshooting Tip

</PRE>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help
topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before
you edit it.

<OL><P><LI>Start the Windows NT Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) on the export
   server.

<P><LI>Go to the following registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control
      \SecurePipeServers\winreg\AllowedPaths
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

<P><LI>Double-click the Machine:REG_MULTI_SZ value and add the following string
   under that last entry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Replicator
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart the computer.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
