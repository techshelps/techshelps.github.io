<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
When a user creates an alias of a Macintosh volume that resides on a
Windows NT Server running Services for Macintosh, that alias will use only
the Apple User Authentication Module (UAM), even if the Windows NT Server
computer requires the Microsoft UAM. (This remains true with Apple System
7.5.)
<P>
Apple System 7.x has the ability to create an alias for a file, folder, or
volume. The alias is a small file that points to the original item. When
the user selects the alias, the system automatically connects the user to
where the original file, folder, or volume is, and uses the original. This
functionality allows the user to have an item in many places at once,
without actually duplicating the item.
<P>
An alias of a Macintosh AppleShare volume lets the user bypass having to
use the Chooser every time they want to use that AppleShare volume. When
the alias to an AppleShare volume is opened, the user is either greeted
with a logon dialog box, or is immediately logged on. (The former only
happens if the alias was created from a volume in which the users name and
password were saved.)
<P>
With AppleShare Client 3.6.5, the alias works on "normal" AppleShare
volumes or on AppleShare volumes that reside on Windows NT Servers running
Services for Macintosh. The difference is that the alias only knows how to
use the Apple UAM, and if the Microsoft UAM is required by the Windows NT
Server, the alias will only be able to use the Apple UAM. This results in
the user being logged on with the guest option, regardless of the user name
and password given.
<P>
AppleShare Client 3.7 software introduced support for third-party UAMs,
such as the Microsoft UAM, in aliases. For more information on the updated
AppleShare Client, contact Apple Technical Support at (800) SOS-APPL.
