The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses how to troubleshoot the following "Stop" error
message in Windows NT:
<P>
<PRE>   Stop: 0x0000000A (parameter1, parameter2, parameter3, parameter4)
   IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL*** Address &lt;x&gt; has base at &lt;x&gt; - &lt;filename&gt;

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This stop message indicates that an attempt was made in kernel mode to
touch pageable memory at a process internal request level (IRQL) that is
too high. This error is usually caused by drivers using improper
addresses.
<P>
<P><h3>Parameters</h3>
 
<P>
1 - Memory referenced
2 - IRQL
3 - Type of access: 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation
4 - Address of instruction that referenced memory in parameter 1
<P>
This article describes troubleshooting steps to take when you receive this
stop error message either during the installation of Windows NT or after
Windows NT is already installed.
<P>
For more general information about this stop error message and its
associated parameters, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : General Information on Stop 0x0000000A

</PRE><h3>"Stop 0x0A" During the Installation of Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
If you receive a "Stop 0xA" error message during the installation of
Windows NT, use the following troubleshooting steps.
<P>
Check the HCL:
<P>
If you receive the "Stop 0x0A" error message during the installation of
Windows NT, you should first verify that your hardware is on the Windows
NT Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). For information about the Windows NT
4.0 HCL, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q131303.htm">Q131303</A></B>
   TITLE     : Latest Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List (HCL)

</PRE>For additional information, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q142865.htm">Q142865</A></B>
   TITLE     : Microsoft Support Policy on Hardware Not On Windows NT HCL

</PRE>If your hardware is not on the Windows NT HCL, the troubleshooting steps
listed below may help isolate the problem. However, you may want to
consider obtaining hardware that is on the HCL.
<P>
Install from the Local Hard Disk:
<P>
If you are installing Windows NT by using the three Windows NT boot disks,
try the following installation method instead:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the I386 folder from the CD-ROM to your hard disk.

<P><LI>From the I386 folder on your hard disk, run the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      winnt /b
</PRE>
<P><LI>Follow the installation instruction screens.
<P>
</OL>Other Troubleshooting Steps During Windows NT Installation:
<P>
If you continue to receive a "Stop 0xA" error message during the
installation of Windows NT, try the following troubleshooting steps
(after each step, try to install Windows NT again):

<OL><P><LI>During the installation bootup, press the F5 key at the "Setup is
   inspecting your computer's hardware configuration..." message. Select
   the correct computer type (or HAL) when you are prompted. For example,
   if you have a single processor select the "Standard PC" HAL.
<P>
   For more information on this procedure, see the following article
   in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q132512.htm">Q132512</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Selecting a Computer Type Before Windows NT Setup Begins

</PRE><P><LI>Disable the following items in your computer's CMOS settings. Consult
   your hardware documentation or manufacturer for instructions on
   disabling these features:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - All caching, including:
<PRE></PRE>         L2 cache
         BIOS cache
         Internal/External cache
         Write back cache on disk controllers
    - All shadowing
    - Plug and Play
    - Any BIOS-based virus protection feature

</PRE><P><LI>Remove all adapters and disconnect all hardware devices that are not
   absolutely required to boot the computer and install Windows NT,
   including:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Network adapter.
    - Internal modem.
    - Sound card.
    - Extra hard disks (at least one is required to complete the
      installation).
    - CD-ROM drive (if installing from the local hard disk).
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you are using a SCSI adapter, check the following items. Consult
   your hardware documentation for information on these items:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Obtain the latest Windows NT driver from the adapter vendor.
    - Disable sync negotiation on the SCSI controller.
    - Check and verify termination and IDs of the SCSI devices.
    - Take all SCSI devices off the chain except for one hard disk (if
      you are booting from or installing to that drive).
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you are using IDE devices, check the following items:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Define the on-board IDE port to Primary only.
    - Check the Master/Slave/Only settings for the IDE devices.
    - Remove all other IDE devices except for the hard disk.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Check the memory SIMMs (RAM) in the computer:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Remove any mismatched memory SIMMs (use all one speed, such as 60ns
      or 70ns).
    - Remove any bad memory SIMMs (run systems test on the memory).
    - Test with different SIMMs (if available).
</PRE>
<P><LI>Call the manufacturer of the computer or motherboard to see if there
   are any known issues with running or installing Windows NT. They may
   be able to provide guidance on the following items:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Running a diagnostics program on the computer.
    - Upgrading the computer's BIOS (if applicable).
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>"Stop 0x0A" After Windows NT Is Already Installed</h3>
 
<P>
If you receive the "Stop 0xA" error message after Windows NT is already
installed, use the following troubleshooting steps.
<P>
Remove any Recently Installed Third-Party Software or Drivers:
<P>
If you have installed any third-party software or drivers, you may want to
remove or disable them from loading. Reboot to see if the software or
driver was causing the error message. If so, contact the vendor of the
software or driver to report the problem.
<P>
If you are not able to boot into Windows NT after you have installed the
software or drivers, you need to use one of the following methods to
restore Windows NT:

<UL><LI>Try the Last Known Good configuration by pressing SPACEBAR during
   bootup when you are prompted. When the Hardware Profile/Configuration
   Recovery menu appears, press L to switch to the Last Known Good
   configuration, then press ENTER.

<LI>Repair the Windows NT installation with the Emergency Repair Disk.

<LI>If Windows NT is on a FAT partition, boot to MS-DOS and rename the
   problem software or driver.
<P>
</UL>Remove Any Newly Installed Hardware:
<P>
If you have added any hardware since Windows NT was installed, you may
want to remove the hardware to see if the error message stops occurring.
If this corrects the problem, you may want to use any or all of the
following methods:

<UL><LI>Obtain updated drivers (if any) for the device.

<LI>Call the vendor to see if there are any known issues with the device.

<LI>Run diagnostics to see if the device is working properly.

<LI>Check Event Viewer for any additional error messages that might help
   determine the device or driver that is causing the problem.
<P>
