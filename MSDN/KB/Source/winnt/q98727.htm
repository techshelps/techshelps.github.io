<P>
Installing Windows NT on the IBM ThinkPad 750
<P>
The Microsoft Windows NT product group has recently provided support for
the IBM ThinkPad 750 system.  The ThinkPad 750 has passed all required
Hardware Compatibility Tests and will be listed on the next update of the
Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List.  This update was tested on ThinkPad
models 750 and 750c.  We anticipate successful results on other models such
as the 750cs and 750p as well.
<P>
At this time, we recommend that a FAT file system be used on the ThinkPad
750.  We have experienced some difficulties with the NTFS file system on
this system which will be addressed in a future Service Pack update.
<P>
In order to run Windows NT Setup on this system, you must first obtain the
updated files and recreate Disks #1 and #8 from the Windows NT floppy
install disk set.  The identified files are:
<P>
<PRE>   NTDETECT.COM
   NTLDR
   SETUPLDR
   FLOPPY.SYS
   UPDAT750.BAT

</PRE>Please follow the instructions below to successfully install Windows NT on
the IBM ThinkPad 750.
<P>
After installing Windows NT on the ThinkPad, do not apply Service Packs 1
or 2 on the system as the Service Pack may overwrite the above referenced
files.  In the near future, we will release a Service Pack update which may
be used on the ThinkPad 750.
<P>
<P>
To Install Windows NT 3.1 on the IBM ThinkPad 750
_________________________________________________

<OL><P><LI>Use diskcopy or other preferred copy utility to make a new copy of disks
   #1 and #8 from the Windows NT 3.1 3.5" install disk set.

<P><LI>Copy the updated files:
<P>
   NTDETECT.COM
   NTLDR
   SETUPLDR
   FLOPPY.SYS
   UPDAT750.BAT
<P>
   to a directory on the hard drive on the ThinkPad 750.

<P><LI>Make the directory containing the updated files the current directory.

<P><LI>Execute the batch file UPDAT750.BAT, specifying the floppy drive to use.
   For example:
<P>
   UPDAT750  A:

<P><LI>Insert the recreated copies of Disks #1 and #8 in the floppy drive of
   the ThinkPad 750 as directed.

<P><LI>You may now execute Windows NT Setup on the ThinkPad 750 using the
   modified disks.  Do not use them to install Windows NT onto any other
   system other than the ThinkPad 750.
<P>
</OL>Another option is to install U.S. Service Pack 2b for Windows NT version
3.1. The service pack includes the NTDETECT and NTLDR files needed to
successfully update the IBM ThinkPad 750.
<P>
