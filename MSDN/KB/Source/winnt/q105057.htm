<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are sharing a network printer and one of the computers on the
network locks up or is taken off the network, the computers connected
to that computer do not receive errors messages when they try to
print.
<P>
Also, when print jobs are waiting on that computer, there will be a
beep every 25 seconds.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The down-level print job is not detecting a printer problem on the
computer, because a connection has already been established. The
computer is not able to report that there is a problem with its
connection with the network printer to the other computers connected
to it. The application printing on another computer only sees the
printer as offline and continues to send print jobs.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Do the following to remove the print jobs:

<OL><P><LI>From Print Manager, choose Printer.

<P><LI>Select Purge Printer or Remove Printer.
<P>
</OL>The print jobs will be lost and will need to be sent to the printer
again.
<P>
NOTE: If you try to reestablish the network connection, an application
error may occur and close the spooler. To restore the spooler, shut
down and restart Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From Print Manager, choose Create Printer.

<P><LI>Add a printer name and choose the printer driver that is on the
   print server you are redirecting to.

<P><LI>In the Print To box, select Network Printer and choose Local Port.

<P><LI>Insert the network printer share name that you want to print to from
   this computer.

<P><LI>Select the "Share this Printer on the Network" check box and share it
   as TEST.

<P><LI>From another computer, choose Printer in Print Manager, and then
   select Connect To Printer.

<P><LI>Once the connection is made, use Notepad or Write to print.

<P><LI>To simulate the network going down or other errors, from the first
   computer, choose Properties in Print Manager, and then select Print
   To and choose any available LPT port.
<P>
</OL>From the second computer, all down-level print jobs will continue to
print and remain in Print Manager as offline. A beep will also occur
every 25 seconds on the first computer.
