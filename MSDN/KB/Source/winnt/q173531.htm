The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novell offers two NetWare Pserver utilities: Pserver.nlm, which runs on the
NetWare file server, and Pserver.exe, which runs on a dedicated
workstation.
<P>
The two utilities serve basically the same purpose: they run as a
resident program servicing up to 16 physical printers, and they poll the
queues attached to those printers. Microsoft supports clients printing on
both types of printer servers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the procedure below to set up a print server to service a printer
queue located at another server. In this case, you are going to service
multiple printers attached and configured on a NetWare 3.x server. The
Netware Pserver may then service Rprinters. (RPRINTER is a Novell
utility that allows the sharing of printers connected to workstations; it
may be run against NetWare's Pserver.nlm.)
<P>
In this example, the following assumptions are made:
<P>
<PRE>   NetWare server:                &lt;Server Name&gt;
   NetWare file server name:      RED_1
   NetWare print server Name:     PS_1 &lt;Same as FPNW&gt;
   NetWare printer name:          PRN_1 PRN_2 PRN_3 PRN_4 &lt;Same as FPNW&gt;
   NetWare print queue name:      NW_Q1 NW_Q2 NW_Q3 NW_Q4
   File server(s) being serviced: RED_1 NT_1

   Windows NT FPNW Server:        &lt;Server Name&gt;
   FPNW server name:              NT_1
   FPNW print server name:        PS_1 &lt;Same as NetWare&gt;
   FPNW printer name:             PRN_1 PRN_2 PRN_3 PRN_4 &lt;Same as NetWare&gt;
   FPNW print queue name:         NT_Q1 NT_Q2 NT_Q3 NT_Q4 &lt;Same as NetWare&gt;
   File server(s) being serviced: NT_1 RED_1

</PRE>NOTE: The print server name and printer name must be identical on both the
NetWare and FPNW servers.
<P>
To set up the print server to service a printer queue located at another
server, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use Print Manager to create a printer on the FPNW server, and call it
   NT_Q1, NT_Q2, NT_Q3, or NT_Q4.

<P><LI>Select the correct driver for your printer from the printer's driver
   list, or click Other and type in the path for the drivers provided by
   the manufacturer.

<P><LI>Type the description (optional).

<P><LI>In the Print To box, click one NetWareCompatiblePServerX port. Each
   printer in the group should be associated with the same
   NetWareCompatiblePServerX port, up to a limit of 16 printers.

<P><LI>Share the printer on the network; FPNW will not see the queue unless
   it is shared. Make sure the share uses an 8.3 naming convention for
   downward compatibility.

<P><LI>Click the Details button. Set the Print Processor type to NWPRINT, if it
   is not set already.

<P><LI>Click OK to save the configuration.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 1 through 7 for each printer to be installed.

<P><LI>Under Server Manager, select FPNW, and then click Print Servers.
<P>
   a. Add a new print server.
<P>
   b. Call it PS_1. Provide a password if needed, or
<P><PRE>      leave it blank. This user account, PS_PS_1, will be used by NetWare
      within User Manager to log on to the FPNW server.
</PRE><P>
   c. Select PS_1, and then click the Printers button to add a new
<P><PRE>      printer. Call it PRN_1.
</PRE><P>
   d. Click to select the Defined Elsewhere type.
<P>
   e. Click OK to save the configuration.
<P>
   f. Repeat steps a through e for each printer to be installed,
<P><PRE>      incrementing the number in the printer name (step c) by one each
      time.
</PRE><P>
   g. Select each printer in turn and click the Queues button in the
<P><PRE>      Printers dialog box. Add the queue from the Available
      Queues box; for the first printer this will be NT_Q1, and so on.
      Click OK to save the configuration.
</PRE><P>
   h. Repeat step g for each printer to be installed, each time selecting
<P><PRE>      the queue that corresponds with the printer that was
      created in Print Manager in step 1 (NT_Q2, NT_Q3, and so on).
</PRE><P>
   i. Click to select the File Server option in the Print Servers dialog
<P><PRE>      box, and add RED_1 to be serviced from the available list of file
      servers.
</PRE><P>
</OL>After you have completed all the steps above, run Registry Editor to enable
all the newly installed printers. Failure to do so will result in the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Not authorized to service queue &lt;nt computer name_FPNW/queue name&gt;.
   Queue will not be serviced by Printer 0, &lt;printer name&gt;.

</PRE></OL>To resolve this problem, use the following steps:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys and
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.

<OL><P><LI>Highlight the following Registry subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet
      \Services\FPNW\Bindery\Type03
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

<P><LI>Expand the Name container to find all queues that are assigned to the
   Pserver, which will look similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      TQUEUE4  ObjectID 0x80040003
      TQUEUE3  ObjectID 0x80030003
      TQUEUE2  ObjectID 0x80020003
      TQUEUE1  ObjectID 0x80010003
</PRE>
<P><LI>After you know the object IDs of the relevant queues (for example,
   TQUEUE4 ObjectID  0x80040003), go to the subcontainer for that object ID
   (still in the Type03 container). There will be two containers: one
   called NT_Q_NAME, the other called Q_SERVERS.

<P><LI>Of the relevant queues (TQUEUE1, TQUEUE2, TQUEUE3, or TQUEUE4 in this
   example), one of the Q_SERVERS will have nonzero values in the Segment1
   field, and the others will have all zeros. The Q_SERVERS that have all
   zeros are incorrect, as this is the list of object IDs of PServer
   devices that can access it.

<P><LI>Copy the nonzero Segment1 field from its queue and paste the binary data
   into the Segment1 field of the queue that contains all zeros. This will
   give both queues the same list of Pservers.

<P><LI>After you have replaced the all-zero data fields, you do not need to
   reboot the server; the Pserver will work immediately.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you go back into Server Manager and try to configure the Pserver
and/or queues, you may further corrupt these registry settings. If this
happens, you will have to go back into the registry and manually
reconstruct the settings.
<P>
The FPNW Pserver is now configured to service the File server RED_1,
running print server PS_1.
<P>
You will need to run PCONSOLE against the NetWare server RED_1, to
configure print server PS_1 to service Windows NT FPNW server NT_1. Use the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>From a command prompt, run Pconsole.exe.

<P><LI>Click Print Server Information, click PS_1, click Print Server
   Configuration, and then click File Servers to be Serviced.

<P><LI>Press the INSERT key.

<P><LI>Click Available File Servers, click FPNW Server (NT_1), and
   then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Press ESCAPE to exit Pconsole.

<P><LI>Unload or reload Pserver.nlm from the system console.
<P>
</OL>NetWare and Windows NT clients can now attach or connect to the NT_Q1
printer queue and print to the Pserver on RED_1.
