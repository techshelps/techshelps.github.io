The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have a Windows NT computer that participates in a trusted domain
structure that is sometimes disconnected from the main network, you may
experience problems accessing it from another computer when it is
disconnected from the main network.
<P>
An example of this scenario is the following:
<P>
A field engineer has two computers. One computer runs Windows NT and
participates in a trusted domain. The other computer runs Windows for
Workgroups. The computer running Windows for Workgroups is connected to the
Windows NT computer, but the computer running Windows NT is not connected
to the main network. Accessing the Windows NT computer from the Windows for
Workgroups computer can result in the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Access Denied

</PRE>The Windows NT computer will look for the Domain Controller when it is
accessed and it cannot find one, so it returns the above error message.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
When you are not connected to the main network, you can change the Windows
NT computer to be a member of a workgroup instead of a member of a domain.
You can do this with the Network applet in Control Panel.
<P>
Now the Windows NT computer will not look for the Domain Controller. You
must have a user with the permissions you want defined in the local account
database or this will not work.
<P>
Don’t forget to rejoin the domain you were in when the Windows NT computer
is reconnected to the main network.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT and
Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
