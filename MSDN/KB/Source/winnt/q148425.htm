The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use duplexed SCSI controllers and a software mirror of either the
operating system partition or a data partition, you may receive the message
"Insufficient space on drive X" where X is the target drive or partition.
This can happen when using identical controllers and drives.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When two SCSI controllers are used, the drive geometry is calculated
differently for controllers that have BIOS enabled and the identical
controller with BIOS disabled.
<P>
With a controller that has BIOS enabled, the operating system can query the
controller BIOS for drive geometry. The BIOS returns a generic drive
geometry translation. This translation will have a cylinder count of less
than 1,024 to work with MS-DOS. The number of heads is normally increased
to arrive at a correct overall size.
<P>
Because the second controller does not have BIOS enabled, all it can
provide the operating system is the size of a block (sector size) and the
total number of blocks on the device. Windows NT then uses a default
translation of 32 tracks per cylinder, 64 heads and adjusts the number of
cylinders to arrive at a correct approximate size. Because of the different
translations, cylinder boundaries will be in different places on the
drives. This often results in a drive's free space being 1 or 2 MB
different on the two identical drives.
<P>
Internally, Windows NT uses a LARGE_INTEGER (64-bit) number for the number
of cylinders and is not constrained by MS-DOS or partition table
limitations.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, perform one of the following:

<UL><LI>If the SCSI controller supports it, set the translation mode on the
   primary controller to 32 sectors per track and 64 heads.

<LI>Disable the BIOS on the primary controller, and enable it on the
   secondary controller. Because creating a mirror does not mirror the
   master boot record, it may also be necessary to set the active partition
   byte on the new boot drive with MS-DOS Fdisk.exe or with a sector
   editor. An alternative is to boot the computer from a Windows NT boot
   floppy disk. Information on how to create this disk can be found in the
   Windows NT Resource Kit and the Concepts and Planning Guide.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT SUR version 4.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
