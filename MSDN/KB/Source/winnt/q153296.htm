The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If your computer supports the shut down and power down feature, you may
experience one of the following problems:

<UL><LI>CHKDSK runs as your computer starts and reports a dirty volume.

<LI>A blue screen appears and displays the following message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      STOP 0x0000007B (parameter, parameter, parameter, parameter)
      INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Recent versions of IDE/ATAPI hard disk drives include a write cache. This
cache is normally flushed automatically depending on an algorithm by the
hard disk manufacturer. On computers that support the shut down and power
down feature, the power may turn off before the write cache is flushed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The IDE/ATAPI specification does not define a command to determine if a
write cache is present or to explicitly flush the cache. The Windows NT
file system drivers modify the boot sector on startup to indicate a dirty
volume. On shut down, the last operation is to modify the boot sector again
to mark the volume clean. This last write is cached in the cache of the
disk. If the power is removed too early, this sector is not written at all
and the volume is still marked dirty. If the power disappears during the
physical write to the disk, the boot sector is corrupt and the blue screen
occurs.
<P>
The fix to this problem is to send an IDLE command to the drive as the last
command at shut down. This synchronous command ensures that the write cache
is flushed.
