<P><h2>SYMPTOM</h2>
 
<P>
In Word for Windows, when you open a file owned by someone else, and modify
and save the file, the file inherits your ownership ID.
<P>
This symptom occurs if the file is saved on a NTFS partition and the owner
of that file granted you the Modify permission for that file.
<P>
Other programs may also exhibit the same symptom.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you save the file, Word deletes the original file and renames a
temporary edit file that you own, to the original filename, making you the
owner of the file.
<P>
<P><h3>How Word for Windows Changes File Ownership Under Windows NT NTFS</h3>
 
<P>
When you open someone else's file, Word creates a new temporary file that
contains a copy of the original and your edits. Windows NT uses the user ID
that you logged on with to set the owner ID on the temporary file.
<P>
When you save the file, Word deletes the original version of the document
and renames the temporary file to the original name of the document making
you the owner of this file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, save the file to a different filename. This
prevents Word from deleting the orginal file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a file on a Windows NT NTFS partition, the file is assigned
an owner ID. By default, the owner ID is your user ID because you created
the file. By default, other users, even administrators, are denied access
to your files or directories unless you grant them access permissions or
file ownership is transferred.
<P>
File ownership is transferred in one of the following ways:

<UL><LI>You may grant the Take Ownership permission to other users, in which
   case those users can take ownership of the file at any time.

<LI>The administrator can take ownership of any file on the computer.

<LI>You open, modify, and save an existing file in Word that you have Modify
   permissions for.
<P>
</UL>More information on file ownership can be found in the "How File Ownership
Works" section of Chapter 5 of the Windows NT "Concepts and Planning
Guide."
