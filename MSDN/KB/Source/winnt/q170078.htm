The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to view or modify NTFS file or directory security
settings, you may receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   The security information for &lt;path&gt; is not standard and cannot be
   displayed.

</PRE>-or-
<P>
<PRE>   The security information for &lt;path&gt; is not standard and cannot be
   displayed. Windows NT 3.x and 4.x support certain features such as Deny
   Access Control Entries but cannot edit security information which uses
   these features. The information may have been modified by a computer
   running Windows NT 5.0, which supports these features and can edit
   information which uses them.

   Do you want to overwrite the current security information?

</PRE>If you say yes and attempt to modify the permissions, the new permissions
will take effect but, later on, the above error messages will reappear if
you attempt to redefine or view the permissions; the original permissions
set will be missing and have to be redefined. This will continue over and
over in a cycle.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Either of the above error messages can occur if Quota Manager (or possibly
some other disk quota software) is running on the server and a lock has
been placed on the parent folder. For example, a quota has been set on a
parent directory, such as users, instead of the subdirectories that exist
beneath it. When the quota limit is reached for the parent directory,
users, a "lock" will be placed on this directory by Quota Manager and will
affect all subdirectories, therefore causing the above error messages to
appear when attempting to view, set, or modify NTFS file or directory
permissions on the subdirectories.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve the problem, remove the lock on the parent folder and, if
applicable, redefine quotas on any subdirectories. After the lock has been
removed, the NTFS file or directory permissions can be set correctly.
