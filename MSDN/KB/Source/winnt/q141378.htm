<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When booting into Windows NT configured with a Xircom Credit Card Ethernet
Adapter model PS-CE2-10, various difficulties may be encountered. An error
message indicating that adapter driver could not be loaded may or may not
appear. Even if no such warning is encountered, access to the network may
not be possible. Another possible symptom is the ability to access the
network, but at a very slow speed.
<P>
One additional symptom that has been observed is that Windows NT will
function flawlessly with the Xircom adapter if the adapter was first
initialized by another operating system such as Windows For Workgroups and
the system then is warm booted into Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
According to NEC technical support, the Xircom adapter needs to configured
to IRQ 5 on the Versa P in order to function with Windows NT. The
difficulty arises from the fact that the built in sound adapter is also
configured to IRQ 5 and cannot be changed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The latest revision of the BIOS for the NEC Versa P models at the time of
this writing is 1.02.15. This version of the BIOS allows the IRQ for the
built in sound adapter to be configured to an IRQ other than IRQ 5.
<P>
Since the NEC Versa P employs Flash BIOS, the BIOS may be upgraded by
simply downloading the current BIOS from NEC.
<P>
For details on availability of this update, please contact NEC Technical
Support at 800-388-8888.
<P>
The Versa P Models are manufactured by NEC, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
