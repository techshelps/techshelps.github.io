The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<P>
</UL>The article contains REGISTRY entries for User Preferences, Part 4. These
subgroups are included:

<UL><LI>Network Connection Entries for Users
<LI>Network Software Entries for Users
<LI>Program Manager Entries for Users:
<LI>Program Groups Entries
<LI>Program Manager Software Groups Entries
<LI>Restrictions Entries for Program Manager
<LI>Program Manager Settings Entries
</UL> 
<P>
This is the fourth of five articles on the User Preferences entries; for
the other entries, see "User Preferences Entries, Part 1," "User
Preferences Entries, Part 2," "User Preferences Entries, Part 3," and "User
Preferences Entries, Part 5".
<P>
<P><h2>REGISTRY ENTRIES FOR USER PREFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
The information presented here is primarily for troubleshooting, showing
the default entry values and explaining the meaning of important entries.
There are no hidden values that you can set for user preferences. All of
these values can be set using the icons in Control Panel or the tools in
the Administrative Tools group, or other programs provided with Windows NT.
<P>
All Registry paths shown here are for HKEY_CURRENT_USER, to show how you
can view entries for the currently logged on user. However, most of these
entries also appear in HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT, where changing entries will
change values for the default user profile.
<P>
<P><h2>NETWORK ENTRIES FOR USERS</h2>
 
This section describes the user preferences and settings for the network.
<P>
<P><h2>NETWORK CONNECTION ENTRIES FOR USERS</h2>
 
<P>
The following Registry path contains the list of specific shares to
reconnect when the user logs on:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Network

</PRE>The Network subkey does not appear unless you are connected to a shared
directory when the Reconnect At Logon option was checked in File Manager.
There is a subkey for each shared directory to be reconnected at system
startup. The name of the subkey is the drive-letter designated for the
connection. Each such subkey can contain the following entries:
<P>
<PRE>ConnectionType   REG_DWORD   0x1 or 1x2
</PRE> 
Default: 0x1
<P>
Specifies connection types as 0x1 for drive redirection or 0x2 for print
redirection.
<P>
<PRE>ProviderName   REG_SZ   Network name
</PRE> 
Default: Microsoft Windows Network
<P>
Specifies the network provider for the path to the shared directory.
<P>
<PRE>RemotePath   REG_SZ   UNC sharename
</PRE> 
<P>
Specifies the UNC name for the shared directory.
<P>
<PRE>UserName   REG_SZ   usename
</PRE> 
Default:  (blank) (That is, the name of currently logged on user is
assumed.)
<P>
Specifies the username under whose authority the connection was
established. The password is not remembered. This name can appear in the
Connect As box in the Connect Network Drive dialog box in File Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>NETWORK SOFTWARE ENTRIES FOR USERS</h2>
 
<P>
The following path contains subkeys with settings for user preferences
related to Event Viewer, Server Manager, User Manager, and User Manager for
Domains:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft
   \Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Network

</PRE>The following table summarizes default settings in the Network subkeys. All
entries have REG_SZ data types.
<P>

                 SortOrder=0 (for sort by full name)
                 Window=132 90 480 258 0

</PRE>The following defines most of the common parameters for these applications:
<P>
<PRE>Confirmation   REG_SZ   Boolean

sort by username, and 0 specifies sort by full name.
<P>
<PRE>Window   Reg_SZ   Pixel location for window
</PRE> 
<P>
Specifies window location when application was last closed as four numbers
plus 1 or 0 to indicate whether the window was iconized.
<P>
The Persistent Connections subkey contains entries that control the
restoration of network connections, under this Registry path:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT
   \CurrentVersion\Network\Persistent Connections

DriveMappingLetter   REG_SZ   UNC  sharename
</PRE> 
<P>
An entry appears for each connection to a shared network directory.
<P>
<PRE>Order   REG_SZ   drive-letter order
</PRE> 
<P>
Specifies the order for the shared directory connections.
<P>
<PRE>SaveConnections   REG_SZ   Yes or No

Default: Yes
<P>
The following Network parameter is found in this Registry path:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT
   \CurrentVersion\Network\World Full Access Shared Parameters

ExpandLogonDomain   REG_SZ   Yes or No
</PRE> 
Default: Yes
<P>

Connect Network Drive dialog box. This is the value set in the Connect
Network Drive dialog box in File Manager by checking the Expand By Default
check box.
<P>
The following parameter is used by the Windows NT administrative
applications:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT
   \CurrentVersion\Network\Shared Parameters

Slow Mode   REG_SZ   String
</PRE> 
Default: "CLOSEDOMAIN;h;FARDOMAIN;l;\\CLOSEMACHINE;h;\\FARMACHINE;1"
<P>
Stores information about which servers and domains are across a Low Speed
Connection. User Manager for Domains, Server Manager, and Event Viewer read
this information unless explicitly told whether to start in Low Speed
Connection mode. The cache is updated each time one of these applications
is started or set to a new, nonlocal focus, or when the user explicitly
changes the Low Speed Connectionsetting. This is an LRU cache of up to 20
focus targets. The first entry is the most recently used.
<P>
This is a shared state between users, so if one user changes the cached
setting for a target focus, other users get that setting by default. The
user must be a member of a group with Power Users or better privileges to
have access to this subkey.
<P>
<P><h2>PROGRAM MANAGER ENTRIES FOR USERS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Program Groups Entries</h3>
 
<P>
The Program Group key contains subkeys that define the contents of all
personal program groups in Program Manager, under this Registry path:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURENT_USER\Program Groups

</PRE>Common groups are defined under the following key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Program Groups

</PRE>The information stored in these subkeys is in binary format, so you cannot
easily edit it from Registry Editor. To change the content of program
groups, use the mouse and keyboard techniques in Program Manager.
<P>
<P><h3>Program Manager Software Groups Entries</h3>
 
<P>
The Groups key specifies group numbers for the defined program groups,
under this Registry path:
<P>
<PRE>   Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Program Manager\Groups

</PRE>These are the default entries. All data types are REG_SZ.
<P>
<PRE>   Group1=Main
   Group2=Accessories
   Group3=Administrative Tools
   Group4=Games
   Group5=Startup

</PRE><h3>Restrictions Entries for Program Manager</h3>
 
<P>
The Restrictions subkey defines restrictions for activities in Program
Manager, under this Registry path:
<P>
<PRE>   Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
   \Program Manager\Restrictions

</PRE>Restrictions can be defined for users in User Profile Editor.
<P>
<PRE>EditLevel   REG_DWORD   Number
</PRE> 
Default: 0
<P>
Sets restrictions for what users can modify in Program Manager. You can
specify one of the following values.
<P>
<PRE>Value      Meaning
</PRE> 
<PRE>0          Allows the user to make any change. (This is the default value.)
1          Prevents the user from creating, deleting or renaming groups. If
           you specify this value, the New, Move, Copy, and Delete commands
           on the File menu are not available when a group is selected.
2          Sets all restrictions in EditLevel=1 and prevents the user from
           creating or deleting program items. If you specify this value,
           the New, Move, Copy, and Delete commands on the File menu are
           not available at all.
3          Sets all restrictions in EditLevel=2 and prevents the user from
           changing command lines for program items. If you specify this
           value, the text in the Command Line box in the Properties dialog
           box cannot be changed.
4          Sets all restrictions in EditLevel=3 and prevents the user from
           changing any program item information. If you specify this
           value, none of the areas in the Properties dialog box can be
           modified. The user can view the dialog box, but all of the areas
           are dimmed.

groups by selecting them and pressing ENTER, or by double-clicking the
icon. Unless you have also disabled the Exit Windows command, users can
still quit Windows by using the Control menu or ALT+F4.
<P>
<PRE>NoRun   REG_DWORD   0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: 0
<P>
Disables the Run command on the File menu if this value is 1. The Run

group.
<P>
<PRE>NoSaveSettings   REG_DWORD   0 or 1
</PRE> 
Default: 0
<P>
