<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Print jobs sent to Services for Macintosh (SFM) AppleTalk-attached printers
may be held in the queue for up to ten minutes after they have printed out
before the job is deleted and the next job can be printed. After printing,
Print Manager displays the job with a size of zero bytes.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the Services for Macintosh (SFM) print monitor finishes sending data
to a printer, it follows with a printer access protocol (PAP) message with
the end of file (eof) flag set. Most printers will respond with a PAP eof,
but some Apple LaserWriters (e.g. Apple LW 16/xxx) will respond to a PAP
EOF with an AppleTalk Transaction Protocol (ATP) release.
<P>
This causes the SFM print monitor to wait for the timer to expire. The
timer was hard-coded to 10 minutes in 3.51. Thus the print queues were
waiting 10 minutes between print jobs.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The timer value has been changed to 30 seconds in Widows NT Service Pack 4,
which should help in most instances.
<P>
For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
PAP eof is passed within an ATP request from machine to machine. The
AppleTalk stack then passes the PAP packet on to the SFM Print Monitor.
Since some printers do not respond with a PAP eof, but instead an ATP
release, the AppleTalk stack processes the packet as an ATP request. Since
the packet does not contain additional PAP information the request does not
get passed up to the higher protocol.
<P>
For additional information on AppleTalk printing, please see the following
