<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a Domain Master Browser runs on multiple network transport stacks, or
uses multiple network adapters (multihomed), it maintains a separate list
of servers for each of its transport/network adapter pairs (also known as
an endpoints). When a client browses the Domain Master Browser, it returns
a list of only those servers associated with the endpoint the request was
received on.
<P>
A client requests a browse list for every transport that is bound (and
running) to the network adapter over which the client is connected to the
server.
<P>
Because the Domain Master Browser cannot determine if the browsing client
has access to servers on endpoints other than the one it received the
request on, it sends the client a list of only those servers associated
with that endpoint.
<P>
If you browse from the Domain Master Browser computer (using File Manager
or the NET VIEW command), you see a merged list of all servers from all
endpoints. This is because all of the servers in each endpoint's list are
reachable from the Domain Master Browser.
<P>
NWLink supports a virtual network and presents a single interface to it's
clients, performing internal routing if necessary. Therefore, there is no
endpoint pairing as there is with other protocols. Thus when an NWLink
client browses the Domain Master Browser over NwLnkIpx/Spx, the returned
list includes the servers from each network adapter that the Domain Master
Browser has NWLink bound to.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For example, assume "ServerOne" is a Domain Controller acting as the Domain
Master Browser. ServerOne has two network adapters connected to segments A
and B. ServerOne has both TCP/IP and NetBEUI bound to the adapter connected
to segment A and only TCP/IP bound to the adapter connected to segment B.
<P>
A client workstation attached to segment A and running only TCP/IP will
receive only the browse list of servers associated with the server's
endpoint for TCP/IP on segment A.
<P>
A client workstation attached to segment A and running both TCP/IP and
NetBEUI will receive the list of servers associated with both of the
server's TCP/IP and NetBEUI endpoints on segment A.
<P>
Neither of the client workstations receive the list of servers associated
with the TCP/IP endpoint on segment B.
