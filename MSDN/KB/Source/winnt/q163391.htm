The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to troubleshoot problems communicating with
servers on the Internet using an Internet browser, ftp, or Telnet. This
article assumes that you are able to connect and log on to your Internet
service provider (ISP) successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience problems communicating with a server on the Internet
for any of the following reasons:

<UL><LI>The server is not functioning properly or has been temporarily removed
   from the Internet.
<LI>Your Internet browser is not configured properly.
<LI>The TCP/IP configuration for your dial-up connection to your ISP is
   incorrect.
<LI>Your ISP's Domain Name Service (DNS) server is not working properly.
<P>
</UL>To determine and resolve the problem you are experiencing, follow the
procedures in each of the following sections in order. After you finish
each procedure, check to see if you can communicate with servers on the
Internet successfully.
<P>
<P><h3>Try a Known Good Server</h3>
 
<P>
If you cannot communicate with a specific server on the Internet, attempt
to connect to the Microsoft Web site using its fully qualified domain
name (FQDN):
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</A></B>

</PRE>An FQDN consists of a host name and a domain name. If you can connect to
the Microsoft Web site using its FQDN, your computer's TCP/IP
configuration is correct.
<P>
If you are able to connect to the Microsoft Web site and you are unable to
connect to another specific Internet site after several attempts, the
other site may not be functioning properly or may be temporarily removed
from the Internet. Try to connect to some different Web sites. If you are
able to connect to some Web sites, but you cannot connect to other Web
sites, contact your ISP for assistance. Your ISP may be able to help you
determine the cause of the problem.
<P>
If you are not able to connect to any Web sites, there may be a problem
with your Internet browser's configuration or with the TCP/IP
configuration for your dial-up connection to your ISP.
<P>
<P><h3>Verify Browser Configuration</h3>
 
<P>
Verify that your Internet browser is configured to connect to the Internet
using your dial-up connection to your ISP and that your Internet browser
is not configured to connect through a proxy server.
<P>
<P><h3>Disable the Multilinking Protocol</h3>
 
<P>
If you have the Multilinking protocol (MP) enabled and your ISP's
Point-to-Point protocol (PPP) server does not support the Multilinking
protocol, you may not be able to communicate with servers on the Internet.
Contact your ISP to determine whether you should disable the Multilinking
protocol. If you use MSN, The Microsoft Network, as your ISP, disable the
Multilinking protocol.
<P>
To disable the Multilinking protocol, use the appropriate method:

<UL><LI>If Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 1 or no service pack is installed, you
   can disable the Multilinking protocol by disabling LCP extensions. To
   do so, follow these steps:
<P>
   1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
<P><PRE>      Dial-Up Networking.
</PRE><P>
   2. Click the phone book entry for your ISP in the Phonebook Entry To
<P><PRE>      Dial box.
</PRE><P>
   3. Click More, and then click Edit Entry And Modem Properties.
<P>
   4. On the Server tab, click the Enable PPP LCP Extensions check box to
<P><PRE>      clear it, and then click OK.
</PRE>
<LI>If Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 is installed, see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q161368.htm">Q161368</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Service Pack 2 May Cause Loss of Connectivity in Remote
                  Access

</PRE><LI>If Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 or later is installed, the
   Multilinking protocol is automatically disabled for dial-up connections
   that do not require the Multilinking protocol.
<P>
</UL><h3>Confirm Your IP Address</h3>
 
<P>
If your ISP has assigned to you a static IP address, verify that the
TCP/IP configuration for your dial-up connection to your ISP contains the
correct information provided by your ISP. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Connect to your ISP.

<P><LI>Type the following command at a command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ipconfig /all
</PRE><P>
   The IPCONFIG /ALL command displays Windows NT TCP/IP settings for all
   network adapters and modem connections. The address for a modem
   connection is displayed as "NDISWAN&lt;x&gt; adapter" where &lt;x&gt; is a number.
   The default gateway for the NDISWAN&lt;x&gt; adapter is the same as the IP
   address; this is normal and by design. More than one NDISWAN&lt;x&gt; adapter
   may be displayed. Any NDISWAN&lt;x&gt; adapters not currently in use display
   zeros for the IP address.

<P><LI>If the IP address displayed for your dial-up connection to your ISP
   does not match the IP address provided by your ISP, change your IP
   address to match the settings provided by your ISP. To do so, follow
   these steps:
<P>
   a. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
<P><PRE>      Dial-Up Networking.
</PRE><P>
   b. Click the phone book entry for your ISP in the Phonebook Entry To
<P><PRE>      Dial box.
</PRE><P>
   c. Click More, and then click Edit Entry And Modem Properties.
<P>
   d. Click the Server tab, and then click TCP/IP Settings.
<P>
   e. Change TCP/IP settings to match the settings provided by your ISP,
<P><PRE>      click OK, and then click OK again.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Enable the Use Default Gateway On Remote Network Option</h3>
 
<P>
If you connect to a local network using a network adapter and to your ISP
using a modem simultaneously, configure your dial-up connection so that
any routing conflicts are resolved in favor of your dial-up connection to
your ISP. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
   Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Click the phone book entry for your ISP in the Phonebook Entry To
   Dial box.

<P><LI>Click More, and then click Edit Entry And Modem Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Server tab, and then click TCP/IP Settings.

<P><LI>Click the "Use default gateway on remote network" check box to select
   it, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Check the Transfer Light</h3>
 
<P>
If you connect to a local network using a network adapter and to your ISP
using a modem simultaneously, a conflict between your network adapter and
your modem can prevent your modem from sending information to servers on
the Internet. To verify that TCP/IP packets are being routed through your
modem to your ISP, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Connect and log on to your ISP.

<P><LI>Right-click the Dial-Up Networking Monitor icon on the taskbar.

<P><LI>Click Open Dial-Up Monitor, and then click the Preferences tab.

<P><LI>Under Show Status Lights, click "As a window on the desktop."

<P><LI>Use the PING command to cause your modem to send information. To do
   so, type the following command at a command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ping &lt;IP address&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;IP address&gt; is the IP address of a known good server on the
   Internet. If you do not know the IP address of a server on the
   Internet, use the IP address for ftp.microsoft.com, 198.105.232.1.
<P>
</OL>Dial-Up Networking Monitor shows the modem status lights in a window. If
the transfer (Tx) light in Dial-Up Networking Monitor flashes when you
ping a server on the Internet, TCP/IP information is being routed through
your modem to your ISP.
<P>
If the transfer (Tx) light in Dial-Up Networking Monitor does not flash
when you ping a server on the Internet, packets are not being routed
through your modem. Verify that the IP address assigned to you by your ISP
for your dial-up connection is not the same as the IP address for your
network adapter or loopback driver (if installed). Also, the IP address of
your network adapter or loopback driver should not be on the same network
as the IP address assigned to you by your ISP for your dial-up connection.
<P>
To display Windows NT TCP/IP settings for all network adapter and modem
connections, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Connect and log on to your ISP.

<P><LI>Type "ipconfig /all" (without quotation marks) at a command prompt.
<P>
</OL>The address for a modem connection is displayed as "NDISWAN&lt;x&gt; adapter"
where &lt;x&gt; is a number. The default gateway for the NDISWAN&lt;x&gt; adapter is
the same as the IP address; this is normal and by design. More than one
NDISWAN&lt;x&gt; adapter may be displayed. Any NDISWAN&lt;x&gt; adapters not currently
in use display zeros for the IP address. Verify that the TCP/IP settings
for your network adapter and your dial-up connection are not in conflict.
<P>
To change the TCP/IP settings of your network adapter or loopback driver,
start the Network tool in Control Panel. The Network tool is only for your
network adapters. When you are configuring the IP address for your Dial-Up
adapter, all configuration should be performed in the Dial-Up Networking
tool.
<P>
<P><h3>Check the Receive Light</h3>
 
<P>
Verify that a response is returned from the server on the Internet that
you are trying to communicate with. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Connect to your ISP.

<P><LI>Right-click the Dial-Up Networking Monitor icon on the taskbar.

<P><LI>Click Open Dial-Up Monitor, and then click the Preferences tab.

<P><LI>Under Show Status Lights, click "As a window on the desktop."

<P><LI>Use the PING command to cause your modem to send information. To do
   so, type the following command at a command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ping &lt;IP address&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;IP address&gt; is the IP address of a known good server on the
   Internet. If you do not know the IP address of a server on the
   Internet, use the IP address for ftp.microsoft.com, 198.105.232.1.
<P>
</OL>Dial-Up Networking Monitor shows the modem status lights in a window. If
the receive (Rx) light in Dial-Up Networking Monitor does not flash when
you ping a server on the Internet, packets are not being received from
your ISP. Contact your ISP for assistance.
<P>
If the receive (Rx) light in Dial-Up Networking Monitor flashes when you
ping a server on the Internet, but you still cannot connect to the server
using its FQDN, there may be a name resolution problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Test Name Resolution</h3>
 
<P>
A Domain Name Service (DNS) server provides host name resolution. If you
cannot connect to a server on the Internet using its fully qualified
domain name (FQDN), there may be a problem with the DNS configuration of
your dial-up connection to your ISP or with your ISP's DNS server.
<P>
To determine if there is a problem with the DNS configuration of
your dial-up connection to your ISP, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Type "ipconfig /all" (without quotation marks) at a command prompt to
   display the IP address of your DNS server. If the IP address for your
   DNS server is not displayed, contact your ISP to obtain the IP address
   for your DNS server.

<P><LI>Verify that you can communicate with your DNS server by pinging your
   DNS server's IP address. You should see a reply similar to the
   following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Pinging &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; with 32 bytes of data:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=77ms TTL=28
      Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=80ms TTL=28
      Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=78ms TTL=28
      Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=79ms TTL=28
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; is the IP address of the DNS server.
<P>
</OL>If you cannot ping the IP address of your DNS server successfully, contact
your ISP to verify that you have the correct IP address for your DNS
server and that your DNS server is functioning properly.
<P>
If you can ping the IP address of your DNS server, but cannot connect to a
server on the Internet using its FQDN, your DNS server may not be
resolving host names properly. If more than one DNS server is available
for your ISP, configure your computer to use a different DNS server. If
using another DNS server resolves the problem, contact your ISP to correct
the problem with the original DNS server.
<P>
When you have verified the correct IP address for your DNS server, update
the TCP/IP settings for your dial-up connection to your ISP. To change or
add a valid IP address for your DNS server for a Dial-Up Networking
phonebook entry, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
   Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Click the phone book entry for your ISP in the Phonebook Entry To Dial
   box.

<P><LI>Click More, and then click Edit Entry And Modem Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Server tab, and then click the TCP/IP Settings button.

<P><LI>Click Specify Name Server Addresses, and then type the correct IP
   address in the Primary DNS box.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then click OK again.
