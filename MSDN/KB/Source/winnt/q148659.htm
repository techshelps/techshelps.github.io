<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Debug Symbols must be set up if a computer needs to be remotely
or locally debugged. This article provides instructions on how to
set up Windows NT Debug Symbols.
<P>

<P>
</UL><h3>What Are Symbols</h3>
 
<P>
Debug Symbol files (symbols) are required to do both kernel and user-mode
debugging in Windows NT. Symbols provide a way to resolve global variables
and function names in the loaded executable file.
<P>
Symbols are produced by the linker when a program is built. They are
stripped out of the retail product and saved in a separate (.DBG) file.
This considerably reduces file size which decreases file load time and thus
increases system performance. Symbols represent Function\API names and
global variables.
<P>
The .DBG file contains symbolic information for each file. They can be
found on the SUPPORT\DEBUG\&lt;platform&gt;\SYMBOLS directory of the Windows NT
installation compact disc.
<P>
Patched builds such as Service Packs require a special set of symbols, that
is a combination of the base build and the patched symbols.
<P>
The SYMBOLS directory is divided up into seven subdirectories, called
Extension Subdirectories (note that many of the symbol files in these
directories match USER MODE components of Windows NT):
<P>
<PRE>   COM - symbols for all files ending in .COM go here
   CPL - symbols for all files ending in .CPL go here.
   DLL - symbols for all files ending in .DLL go here
   DRV - symbols for all files ending in .DRV go here
   EXE - symbols for all files ending in .EXE go here
   SCR - symbols for all files ending in .SCR go here
   SYS - symbols for all files ending in .SYS go here.

</PRE>The symbols must match their respective files. Symbols from a different
build give erroneous information.  All of the symbol file link dates must
match those on the computer being debugged.
<P>
Setting Up a Custom Symbol Trees
 
<P>
The Symbol Tree is the subdirectory tree on the host computer which
contains the symbol files which match the remote computer being debugged.

<OL><P><LI>Create a Subdirectory on the host computer. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>     MKDIR C:\SYMBOLS
</PRE>
<P><LI>Always start with the base Windows NT version number. Copy the following
   files from the installation compact disc for the appropriate version:
<P>
<P><PRE>     XCOPY [CD Drive]:\SUPPORT\DEBUG\I386 C:\SYMBOLS /S.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Copy the symbols for the appropriate Service Pack into the custom tree.
   Service Pack symbols can be found on FTP.MICROSOFT.COM.
<P>
   For example, the symbols for Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 4 can be
   downloaded from the following location:
<P>
<P><PRE>       \bussys\winnt\winnt-public\fixes\usa\NT351\ussp4\symbols
</PRE><P>
   Download the file called SYM_351&lt;X&gt;.EXE where X represents the platform
   (I for x86, A for Alpha, P for PPC).
<P>
   Decompress the files into the symbol tree. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>     SYM_351&lt;X&gt;.EXE -d C:\SYMBOLS
</PRE>
<P><LI>Copy any third-party patches, such as the Compaq SSD symbols, to the
   custom symbol tree. These symbols must be obtained from the third-party
   vendor.

<P><LI>If Microsoft has supplied unique fixes for your installation, copy the
   DBG file supplied with the fix into the appropriate subdirectory (for
   example: SYS, EXE, DLL).

<P><LI>If the computer is a single processor Intel system, the symbol tree is
   complete. Please see the "After the Symbol Tree is Created" section
   below.
<P>
</OL>Single Processor vs. Multiprocessor
 
<P>
Windows NT uses a special kernel for SMP systems. During installation this
kernel is renamed. It is important that the DBF file is renamed for
debugging.
<P>
<PRE>   NTOSKRNL.EXE  NTOSKRNL.DBG  = Single processor
   NTKRNLMP.EXE  NTKRNLMP.DBG  = Multiple processors

</PRE></OL>If the system is a Multi-Processor, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Change the directory to the DLL component directory. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CHDIR C:\SYMBOLS\DLL
</PRE>
<P><LI>Rename the uniprocessor kernel to another filename. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      RENAME NTOSKRNL.DBG NTOSKRNL.UNI
</PRE>
<P><LI>Copy the multiprocessor kernel over the uniprocessor kernel. For
   example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      COPY NTKRNLMP.DBG NTOSKRNL.DBG
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Custom HAL.DLL</h3>
 
<P>
Some hardware platforms require a special Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
Driver. Like the Kernel file, the custom HAL is renamed during the
installation process. Here is a list of common HALs:
<P>

</PRE>How to Determine Which HAL to Use:
<P>
During installation, a text log file is created. This file has a line which
shows which HAL is installed during setup. If the HAL has changed after
the original Setup, the SETUP.LOG does not reflect the change. To verify,
do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Go to %SystemRoot%\REPAIR subdirectory.

<P><LI>Run ATTRIB -R -H -S SETUP.LOG to make the file visible.

<P><LI>Use Notepad to view SETUP.LOG and search for "Hal"
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This same technique can be useful to verify if a special kernel is
also used.
<P>
Copy the HAL into the Symbol Tree:

<OL><P><LI> Change directory to \SYMBOLS\DLL.

<P><LI> Rename HAL.DBG to HAL.X86.

<P><LI> Copy the "Custom HLL.DBG" to HAL.DBG.
<P>
</OL><h3>After the Symbol Tree Is Created</h3>
