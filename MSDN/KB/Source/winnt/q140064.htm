<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are four different types of static mappings a WINS server can assign
to WINS client computers. They are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   - Unique
   - Group
   - Internet Group
   - Multihomed

</PRE>Each of these entries represent various types of WINS clients.
<P>
NOTE: Static entries should only be used for non-WINS aware clients.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Types of Static Mappings</h3>
 
<P>
Unique: Unique name in the database, with one address per name.
<P>
Group: Normal group, where addresses of individual members are not stored.
<PRE>       The client broadcasts name packets to normal groups.

</PRE>Internet group: Groups with NetBIOS names that have 0x1C as the 16th byte.
<PRE>                An internet group stores up to 25 addresses for members.
                The maximum number of addresses is 25. For registrations
                after the 25th address, WINS overwrites a replica address
                or, if none is present, it overwrites the oldest
                registration.

</PRE>Multihomed: Unique name that can have more than one address (multihomed
<PRE>            computers). The maximum number of addresses is 25. For
            registrations after the 25th address, WINS overwrites a replica
            address or, if none is present, it overwrites the oldest
            registrations. The following is a description of the different
            type of special names indicated by the 16th byte of the
            computer or domain name:

   &lt;00&gt; - The redirector name, which is used with net view

   &lt;03&gt; - The messenger service name for sending messages

   &lt;1B&gt; - The domain master browser name, which clients and browsers use to
          contact the domain master browser. A domain master browser gets
          the names of all domain master browsers. When WINS is queried for
          the domain master browser name, it handles the query like any
          other name query and returns its address.

          WINS assumes that the computer that registers a domain name with
          the 1B character is the primary domain controller (PDC). This
          name is registered by the browser running on the PDC. This
          ensures that the PDC is in the internet group name list that is
          returned when a 1C name is queried, for which WINS always returns
          the address of the 1B name along with the members of a 1C name.

   &lt;1C&gt; - The internet group name, which contains a list of the specific
          addresses of systems that have registered the name. The domain
          controllers registers this name.

   &lt;1D&gt; - Clients resolve this name to access the master browser for server
          lists. There is one master browser on a subnet.

   &lt;1E&gt; - A normal group. Browsers broadcast to this name and listen on it
          to elect a master browser. The broadcast is done on the local
          subnet and should not cross routers.

   &lt;20&gt; - The Lan Manager server name.
