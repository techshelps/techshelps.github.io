<UL><LI>NetPower MIPS (or any other machine using the Mozart sound/midi/joyport
   chip)
<LI>Aztech sound cards.
<P>
</UL><h2>Plug and Play Sound Blaster Support</h2>
 
<P>
Drivers for Plug and Play Sound Blaster sound cards are included on the
Windows NT compact disc. They can be found in \DRVLIB\AUDIO\SBPNP folder.
Before installing the drivers see, the Readme.txt file in the same
directory. For more information about Plug and Play on Windows NT, see
"Plug and Play ISA Device Installation and PNPISA.SYS" earlier in this
document.
<P>
<P><h2>Sound Blaster/ATAPI Problems</h2>
 
<P>
ATAPI devices such as CD ROM drives are not supported in this release on
the built-in IDE controller on Sound Blaster Plug and Play adapters.
<P>
<P><h2>Sound Blaster/SCSI Problems</h2>
 
<P>
Sound Blaster/SCSI cards and PCI SCSI cards may display an
INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE blue screen when performing a new installation or
an upgrade. This occurs because the BIOS assigns the PCI SCSI card an
interrupt number that is already in use.  If this occurs, physically remove
the sound card before reinstalling, or remove the driver during text mode
portion of setup and then reinstall after the installation or upgrade is
completed.
<P>
<P><h2>Distorted Sound Using Toshiba Laptop with Integrated Sound Card</h2>
 
<P>
Some games (such as Doom95) may have garbled sound on Windows NT version
4.0 when running in full-screen mode on a Toshiba laptop with an integrated
sound card. To solve this problem change your sound card's DMA setting
from DMA 1 to another available channel.
<P>
<P><h2>Sound Blaster Pro 2 CT1600 Using Motorola Powerstack PowerPC</h2>
 
<P>
When using an SB Pro2 CT1600 sound card on a Motorola Powerstack PPC the
MIDI synth chip may hiss. This occurs if the CT1345 chip is labeled 91. To
work around the the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, Accessories, Multimedia, and then
   double-click Media Player.
</OL>2. On the Device menu, click MIDI Sequencer..
3. Play any MIDI file for 15 seconds or longer. Sample files are located in
<PRE>   the Media folder in your %systemroot%\Media directory.

</PRE></OL>This procedure will need to be performeed each time the machine is
restarted.
<P>
Determining if your system is capable of utilizing ESS audio support in
Windows NT version 4.0
 
<P>
Many system manufacturers implement ESS audio hardware in their mobile
computer product lines. Some of these manufacturers include:
<P>
<PRE>   Digital Equipment Corporation
   Gateway
   Hewlett-Packard
   IBM
   Toshiba
   Zeos

</PRE>To determine if your system implements an audio chipset, run the Windows NT
NTHQ tool to analyze your hardware.
<P>
To determine if your mobile system has ESS audio functionality available
using Windows NTHQ:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Windows NT compact disc in the CD-ROM drive.
</OL>2. From the command prompt, run Makedisk.bat from &lt;compact disc drive
<PRE>   letter&gt;:\Support\HQTool
</PRE></OL>3. Insert the floppy disk that you created into drive A:
4. Restart the computer.
5. Once the NTHQ tool has analyzed your computer, you can click Other to
<PRE>   determine if your system has ESS audio functionality implemented.

</PRE>If your computer has this audio functionality implemented, obtain the ESS
driver from the \Drvlib\audio\ess\&lt;platform&gt; where &lt;platform&gt; is Alpha,
I386, Mips, or Ppc.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                           Application Notes

</PRE>The following sections provide general information about running
applications on Windows NT version 4.0 that were created for MS-DOS,
Windows version 3.1, Windows 95, or Windows NT version 3.x. Windows NT
version 4.0 has excellent support for those applications. If you do
encounter a problem, this section provides some solutions. In addition,
this section lists specific applications that have known problems with
Windows NT version 4.0. The companies have been notified of these problems.
<P>
<P><h2>Error Dialogs Naming "ReinitializeCriticalSection"</h2>
 
<P>
Some applications attempt to replace the URL.DLL file that ships with
Windows NT. If the applications are successful, the replacement .DLL file
may be an older version specific to the Windows 95 operating system. When
any application attempts to initialize the replacement URL.DLL, the
following error dialog will appear:
<P>
<PRE>   "The procedure entry point ReinitializeCriticalSection could not be
    located in the dynamic link library KERNEL32.dll."

</PRE>This does not necessarily represent an error in the application you are
launching when the dialog appears. Another unrelated application has most
likely replaced the URL.DLL file. In most cases, you can click OK in the
dialog box and your application will continue as expected.
<P>
<P><h3>To reinstall the correct URL.DLL file</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the %systemroot%\system32 folder, rename URL.DLL to URL.OLD.
</OL>2. Copy URL.DLL from the \i386 folder on the Windows NT compact disc to
<PRE>   %systemroot%\system32 (substitute your platform folder for "i386" on
   RISC machines).
</PRE></OL>3. Reboot to initialize the copied URL.DLL.
<P>
<P><h2>Error Dialogs From Win32s Applications</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT version 4.0 has been thoroughly tested with Win32s applications
and most users will not experience any difficulties. After upgrading from
Windows 3.x to Windows NT version 4.0, some Win32s applications may not
run. You may see error dialogs stating that the wrong .DLLs were installed.
Reinstall the applications to reinstall the Win32s DLLs.  Contact the
application vendor if problems persist.
<P>
<P><h2>Long Printer Names</h2>
 
<P>
Several Windows version 3.x applications cannot print to a printer if the
printer name contains more than a specified number of characters. Some
applications will generate a General Protection Fault if this is attempted.
Other applications may not print to any printer, even printers with short
names, if the default printer has a "long" name. To resolve these problems,
rename the printers used with the applications to shorter names and make
one of those printers the default printer. See "General Printing Issues" in
the Printer.wri file.
<P>
<P><h2>Screen Appearance</h2>
 
<P>
Dialog and listbox areas are incorrectly proportioned in some cases. You
may be able to control some system-wide size specifications in Control
Panel.
<P>
<P><h2>Windows 95 Applications and Microsoft Foundation Class Libraries</h2>
 
<P>
Many Windows 95 applications use Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) version
3.0 libraries. Some of these applications do not install the libraries they
require. If the libraries they require are not installed, these
applications may not install or may not run after installation. If other
applications have installed the MFC DLLs, installation will complete and
the application will run as expected.
<P>
To obtain the correct files, copy MFCxx.DLL (from the Windows 95
systemroot\system directory, or from a disk supplied by the manufacturer)
to the Windows NT systemroot\system directory (typically c:\winnt\system).
<P>
<P><h2>Opening Files Created in Windows NT by Using Windows version 3.x</h2>
 
<P>
If you create a file, using an MS-DOS- or Windows version 3.1-based
application on Windows NT version 4.0, you may get the error "Cannot find
WINSPOOL.DRV" when using the file in Windows version 3.x. This error occurs
because some 16-bit applications attach drive location information to the
files they create.
<P>
Click Close in the error message dialog box and save the file to prevent
this error while using the file in Windows version 3.x. To prevent the
error for all applications and their files, create a file in the
\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory called WINSPOOL.DRV. The file is not used, so the
content of the file does not matter.
<P>
<P><h2>Connecting to the Internet by Using MSN</h2>
 
<P>
You can use MSN, the Microsoft Network, as your Internet provider, only if
you have already created an MSN account by using Windows 95. When you
connect to the Internet through Windows NT by using MSN, proprietary online
services such as mail or bulletin boards are not available.
<P>
<P><h3>To connect to MSN</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the Dial-Up Networking dialog box, click New.
 2. In the Basic tab, type a name for your entry - for example, MSN.
 3. Enter the phone number for the local MSN service that allows Internet
    access.
 4. Select a modem and use the default modem configurations.
 5. In the Server tab in the Dial-Up Server Type box, select PPP.
 6. In the Protocols box, select only TCP/IP.
 7. Clear the Enable PPP LCP Extensions box.
 8. In the Security tab, select the Accept Any Authentication Including
    Clear Text option, and then click OK.
 9. Click Dial.
</OL>10. In the Authentication dialog box, supply your MSN user name by using
<PRE>    this format: MSN/username
    The format is case sensitive.
</PRE></OL>11. Type your MSN password, and then click OK.
<P>
<P><h2>Running Serial Communications Applications</h2>
 
<P>
For reliable data transfer at the highest baud rate, use communications
protocols that support end-to-end flow control. If the protocol you use
does not support flow control, you may need to reduce the serial port baud
rate for reliable communication. The following table shows which protocols
support flow control:
<P>
<P><h3>Serial flow control protocol</h3>
 
<P>
Flow control
<P>
ASCII (Xon/Xoff)
<PRE>   No
</PRE>XMODEM
<PRE>   Yes
</PRE>XMODEM-1K
<PRE>   Yes
</PRE>YMODEM
<PRE>   Yes
</PRE>YMODEM-G (1)
<PRE>   No
</PRE>ZMODEM (2)
<PRE>   No
</PRE>Kermit
<PRE>   Yes
</PRE>CompuServe B+
<PRE>   Yes

   (1) The -G option disables flow control
   (2) Some applications allow flow control with ZMODEM. For example, you
       can enable flow control with Procomm Plus 2 by setting the Transmit
       Method to 4K WINDOW.

</PRE>Windows NT supports Windows version 3.x communications programs by using
the communications driver COMM.DRV. Other communications drivers are not
supported and may not function reliably. You can check or change the
communications driver by using the Registry Editor. The value should be:
comm.drv:REG_SZ:comm.drv
<P>
The value is located in the following Registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WOW\boot
<P>
To run multiple Windows version 3.x communications applications
simultaneously, or to run a Windows version 3.x communications application
in the background or minimized and still maintain a reliable connection,
modify your system to Foreground And Background Applications Equally
Responsive. To do this, click Start, point to Settings, then click Control
Panel. Double-click the System icon. Click the Performance tab and set
Application Performance Boost to None.
<P>
<P><h2>Multimedia Applications</h2>
 
<P>
Some older applications install an old version of the 16-bit Video for
Windows runtimes. This may cause system problems with other 16-bit
applications that play video. Your system may run out of virtual memory,
resulting in warnings to that effect.
<P>
Start the Media Player on the Start menu, point to Programs, Accessories,
Multimedia. It will tell you that the Registry has been changed, and give
you the option to fix it. Accept that option.
<P>
If an error message stating that Wing32.dll has incorrectly been placed in
the c:\windows\system directory appears when you run multimedia
applications from a CD-ROM drive, move Wing32.dll to the Windows NT
\system32 directory (typically c:\winnt\system32).
<P>
<P><h3>Running MS-DOS-based Multimedia Applications</h3>
 
<P>
All MS-DOS-based multimedia applications directly access the computer
hardware. Windows NT does not allow applications to directly access
hardware. Consequently, any application (including 16-bit Windows-based
applications) that attempts to directly access the hardware might fail.
Typically the application will run without the multimedia features, but the
application may be slow.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>Disk Compression Programs</h2>
 
<P>
If you compress files using the Microsoft DriveSpace(r) or Microsoft
DoubleSpace(r) disk compression tool on Windows 95 or MS-DOS, you will not
be
able to access the files by using Windows NT version 4.0. To avoid this
situation, do not compress files using these tools.
<P>
<P><h2>MS-DOS Issues</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>MS-DOS Undelete Sentry Blocks</h3>
 
<P>
Windows NT cannot recognize free space that was created on a FAT partition
by using the undelete sentry feature in MS-DOS version 6.2. With the sentry
method, MS-DOS reserves part of the hard drive to remember deleted files,
then compensates during MS-DOS queries about free space. Because Windows NT
doesn't understand sentry, it reports the space on the FAT partition as
used.
<P>
<P><h3>Using MS-DOS-Based Disk Tools</h3>
 
<P>
Using MS-DOS-based disk tools on FAT partitions used by Windows NT version
4.0 can cause files to be deleted or long filenames to be lost. Microsoft
recommends that you run only disk tools specifically designed for Windows
NT version 4.0, or, when running MS-DOS, the chkdsk or scandisk tools.
<P>
To prevent the Windows NT version 4.0 FAT file system from using long
names, set the following Registry entry to 1, using Registry Editor:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem
   \Win31FileSystem

</PRE>After changing the entry, double-click on the entry, and then replace "0"
displayed in DWORD Editor with "1." Then restart your computer for the
change to take effect.
<P>
Caution: If you use MS-DOS--based disk tools on a FAT disk partition used
by Windows NT, the tool can cause the loss of long filenames or delete
files on the FAT partition. If you dual boot to Windows 95 and Windows NT
and use the Norton Utilities for Windows 95, the Norton DiskFix tool could
delete any files created by Windows NT on the FAT partition. You should
back up the FAT partition before running any disk tool other than chkdsk.
<P>
<P><h3>MS-DOS Applications Requiring a PIF File</h3>
 
<P>
If you are accustomed to using a PIF (Program Information File) with your
MS-DOS programs, you can continue doing so on Windows NT version 4.0. To
change settings, change the .PIF or .EXE file properties, do not edit the
.PIF file. For instructions on how to do this, on the Start menu, click
Help, click the Contents tab, double-click How To..., double-click Run
Programs, and then double-click "Optimizing MS-DOS Programs."
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Running MS-DOS-Based Remote Control Applications</h3>
 
<P>
Remote control applications control a remote computer from a local computer
through a serial connection. The local computer runs a program that sends
keystrokes to the remote computer while displaying a copy of its screen.
The remote computer runs a memory-resident program that allows the local
computer to control it. If the remote computer is running Windows NT, you
must create custom startup files and a custom PIF to set up the MS-DOS
environment for the memory-resident program.
<P>
To create the startup files:

<OL><P><LI>Edit the files AUTOEXEC.NT and CONFIG.NT files, and then save the files
   under new names:
</OL>2. In the custom AUTOEXEC file, add the name of the memory-resident program
<PRE>   if you want to start it when you run the PIF.
</PRE></OL>3. In the custom CONFIG file, add the commands dosonly and echoconfig. The
<PRE>   dosonly command ensures that no programs can be started that can disable
   the memory-resident program.

</PRE>To create a .PIF file for MS-DOS Remote Control Applications:

<OL><P><LI>In Windows NT Explorer, click the %ystemroot% folder, and then right-
   click the file _DEFAULT.PIF.
</OL>2. On the context menu, click Properties.
3. Click the _default button Properties, click the Program tab.
4. In the cmd line box, type COMMAND.COM.
5. Click Windows NT.
6. In Windows NT PIF Settings box, specify the names of the custom startup
<PRE>   files you created. Click OK.
</PRE></OL>7. Click the Misc. tab. Under Other, ensure that the Fast Pasting box is
<PRE>   checked.

</PRE><h2>Running Applications that Attempt to Directly Access the Hardware</h2>
 
<P>
Any MS-DOS based or 16-bit Windows based application that attempts to
directly access the hardware fails under Windows NT. Windows NT does not
allow applications to directly access hardware. Consequently, applications
that attempt to directly access the hardware fail.
<P>
Specific Applications:

<P><h3>AutoCAD Release 11 286 and Release 12</h3>
 
<P>
The Autolisp extensions (EXTLISP.EXE) for AutoCAD are not supported because
they require Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI).
<P>
To correctly redraw and perform graphic operations such as cut and paste,
you must use the correct AutoCAD video driver. The default AutoCAD video
driver is Windows Accelerated Display Driver ADI 4.2 by Autodesk, Inc.

<P><h3>Lotus WordPro '96 for Windows 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
During the installation of this application, an error dialog box appears
stating the application may function incorrectly.  Clicking Ignore results
in a successful installation.
<P>
<P><h3>Macromedia Freehand</h3>
 
<P>
If font smoothing is enabled, you cannot rotate text. To disable font
smoothing, from Display in Control Panel, click the Plus! tab and clear
font smoothing.

Printing from versions 6.0 and 6.0+ will cause an Access Violation if the
printer name exceeds 20 characters. Patch files are available from Mathsoft
at <B><A HREF="http://www.mathsoft.com">http://www.mathsoft.com.</A></B>

<P><h3>Maxis SimAnt</h3>
 
<P>

although the program is uninstalled.
<P>
<P><h3>Micrografx Designer 6.0</h3>
 
<P>
Designer (part of the ABC Graphics Suite) may display an error dialog box
that refers to SMapLS_IP_EBP_12 in KERNEL32.dll when printing to PostScript
printers. The dialog box appears because Designer misinterprets the
operating system version information and tries to call a procedure found
only in the Windows 95 version of the .dll file. Clicking OK will allow
printing to continue as expected.
<P>
The printer setup property page has a different appearance under Windows NT
version 4.0 than it does under Windows 95.
<P>
Micrografx Designer substitutes a monospace font such as Courier for
TrueType fonts.
<P>
Contact Micrografx at (214) 234-2694 or online at <B><A HREF="http://www.micrografx.com">http://www.micrografx.com</A></B>
for upgrade information.
<P>
<P><h3>Micrografx Picture Publisher</h3>
 
<P>
Picture Publisher (part of the ABC Graphics Suite) may display black
rectangles instead of text labels in dialogs or on toolbars. Picture
Publisher occasionally misinterprets the brush handles it receives from
Windows NT and uses a black brush instead of a gray brush to paint the
label backgrounds. Closing and restarting Picture Publisher will often
cause the affected labels to display normally, although other labels in
other dialogs may then appear as black rectangles. Contact Micrografx at
(214) 234-2694 or online at <B><A HREF="http://www.micrografx.com">http://www.micrografx.com</A></B> for upgrade
information.
<P>
<P><h3>Micrografx Windows Draw 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
Version 3.0 (720K) release disks may fail during installation. You cannot
copy or cut elements from Micrografx Draw.
<P>
<P><h3>Micrografx Windows Draw 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
Whenever attempting to select a 'New Color', the COLOR dialog may appear
black or half black due to the access methods employed by the application.
