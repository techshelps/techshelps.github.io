The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A series of MS-DOS-based console applications may take a long time (perhaps
several minutes) to complete on a multiprocessor computer. The console
windows may remain blank and appear to stop responding (hang). All the
applications do eventually finish, but this may take an unusual amount of
time.
<P>
The same series of applications will finish in a few seconds on a single
processor computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A console handle table lock is being held too long during the freeing of a
console. Processing for other console-related activities is delayed while
the lock is held.
<P>
The problem is not usually seen on single processor computers as a context
switch to another console process is unlikely during console cleanup. On a
multiprocessor computer, however, multiple console-mode processes may be
executing simultaneously, which greatly increases the chance of
encountering this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:
<P>
Specify the /NUMCPU=1 option in the Boot.ini file and then restart Windows
NT. This effectively downgrades the system to a single processor computer,
which does not normally experience this problem.
<P>
<PRE>   -or-

</PRE>Obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following time stamp:
<P>
<PRE>   10/13/97  05:01p               175,376 winsrv.dll  (Intel)
   10/13/97  04:59p               315,152 winsrv.dll  (Alpha)

</PRE>This fix modifies console handling so that the handle table lock is
released during noncritical sections of console cleanup. This allows other
simultaneously executing console processes to continue and finish in a
reasonable time frame.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
All MS-DOS console-mode applications are affected by this problem on
multiprocessor computers under Windows NT 4.0. Windows applications are not
affected.
<P>
This problem has been seen when attempting to start multiple PERL scripts
as CGI applications run in console-mode on multiprocessor intranet web
servers.
