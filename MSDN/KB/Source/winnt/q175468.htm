The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
For each Windows NT Workstation that is a member of a domain, there is a
discrete communication channel (for example, the secure channel) with a
domain controller.
<P>
The secure channel's password is stored along with the computer account on
the primary domain controller (PDC), and is replicated to all backup domain
controllers (BDCs). The password is also in LSA secret $MACHINE.ACC of the
workstation. Each workstation owns such secret data.
<P>
Every seven days, the workstation sends a secure channel password change
and the computer account password is updated. Computer account password
changes are marked as "Announce Immediate" so that each time a computer
account password is modified, a replication takes place immediately.
<P>
A new Netlogon parameter is available as a hotfix so that the 7-day period
may be extended up to 1,000,000 days.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For example, if a domain has 1,000 workstations, a computer account
password change will occur every:
<P>
<PRE>   1 week / 1000 = 7 x 24 x 60 / 1000 minutes = 10 minutes

</PRE>Therefore, a SAM replication takes place every 10 minutes regardless of the
replication interval defined on the PDC (for example, with the Pulse and
PulseMaximum registry settings).
<P>
If all domain controllers are on the same LAN, the behavior described
above only leads to PDC overload. But, if there are many BDCs split into
different subnets interconnected by routers, each replication may cost a
lot of money. For example, with 100 BDCs connected to a central site with
ISDN lines, each replication leads at least to 100 ISDN communications.
<P>
In such a configuration, changing computer accounts cost per month:
<P>
<PRE>   (30 days / 10 minutes) * 100 BDCs = (30 x 24 x 60 / 10) * 100

   = 432 000 ISDN connections

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help
topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before
you edit it.
<P>
There are three workarounds for this issue.
<P>
<P><h3>Method One</h3>
 
<P>
The first workaround consists in adding the following registry parameter on
all Windows NT workstations:
<P>
<PRE>   Key     = HLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetLogon\Parameters
   Value   = DisablePasswordChange REG_DWORD 1
   Default = 0

</PRE>This will prevent workstations from changing passwords. This registry value
could be added after having joined the domain (and restarted) so that the
computer account password would have at least been changed once with a
random value only known by the system.
<P>
<P><h3>Method Two</h3>
 
<P>
A second workaround consists of refusing passwords changed at domain
controllers levels. On all domain controllers, add the following registry
value:
<P>
<PRE>   Key     = HLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetLogon\Parameters
   Value   = RefusePasswordChange REG_DWORD 1
   Default = 0

</PRE>For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q154501.htm">Q154501</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Disable Automatic Machine Account Password Changes

</PRE><h3>Method Three</h3>
 
<P>
A new parameter has been added as a hotfix in order to change the frequency
at which workstations change secure channel password. It can be added on
all workstations and also on all BDCs.
<P>
<PRE>   Key     = HLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetLogon\Parameters
   Value   = MaximumPasswordAge REG_DWORD
   Default = 7
   Range   = 1 to 1,000,000 (in days)

</PRE>The above parameter is specified in days. The default value is seven and
the minimum value is one.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
