<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Shortly after you create a Macintosh volume on a partition larger than
approximately seven (7) GB with a large number of files, the system
may crash with a STOP 0x24 error in NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM (NTFS.SYS).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The AppleTalk protocol driver Afp.sys, depletes the memory pool allocated
to non-paged pool while indexing a Services for Macintosh (SFM) volume.
<P>
This problem may also occur when the Services for Macintosh (SFM) server
is experiencing performance problems, Event ID 12053 errors, or indexing
problems. See the following Microsoft Knowledge Base articles for more
information:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q136300.htm">Q136300</A></B>
   TITLE     : Event ID 12053 Caused by Macintosh Client Disconnect

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q147909.htm">Q147909</A></B>
   TITLE     : Troubleshooting MacVolume Creation Errors

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Increase the non-paged pool memory available to kernel or to reduce the
number of files on the SFM volume. The amount of non-paged pool available
to kernel is a fixed value that is based upon the total RAM in the system,
so if you increase the RAM you will increase the non-paged pool available
to kernel.
<P>
<PRE>   -or-

</PRE>Obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem will generally only occur on a partition with 100,000 or
more files that take up 7 to 8 GB or more disk space. When a SFM volume is
created, the service will start indexing the partition. The indexing
routines create memory structures that consume a large amount of non-
paged pool memory and if your volume is large enough and has enough
files, you will run out of non-paged pool and the system will stop
responding. In most cases, this results in a STOP 0x24 in NTFS, although it
can occur when another kernel-mode driver attempts to allocate resources
that require non-paged pool memory.
<P>
The system may simply be slow and unresponsive for the first 20 to 40
minutes after creating the Macintosh volume. This is because of the large
amount of kernel memory being used by SFM. If SFM is able to complete
the indexing without running out of non-paged pool memory the memory
will be freed and the system will return to normal. There should be no
problems after this unless enough changes occur that a full re-indexing is
necessary. In this case, SFM will have to repeat the procedure.
<P>
The simplest way to identify this problem is to run Performance Monitor
after you create the SFM volume and watch the Memory\Pool Nonpaged Bytes
counter. If a constant increase in non-paged pool bytes occurs over a 20 to
30 minute period of time, resulting in large amount (20 to 30 MB or more)
of non-paged pool, you may be experiencing this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
