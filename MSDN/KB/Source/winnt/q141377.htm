<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT provides two utilities that allow you to modify the
configuration and registration databases. The two utilities are REGEDIT.EXE
and REGEDT32.EXE. This article describes the differences between the two
utilities.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>REGEDIT.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
REGEDIT.EXE is the registration editor for 16-bit Windows, which is used to
modify the Windows registration database. The database is located in the
Windows directory as REG.DAT. The database contains information about 16-
bit applications, and is used by File Manager for opening and printing
files. It is also used by applications that support Object Linking and
Embedding (OLE). REG.DAT is used and maintained by Windows on Windows (WOW)
and 16-bit Windows applications. The WOW layer resides on top of the
Virtual DOS Machine (VDM).
<P>
REGEDIT.EXE is a 16-bit application that is included in Windows NT for
compatibility with previous 16-bit applications. Regedit provides a method
for examining REG.DAT under Windows NT. You can migrate the REG.DAT
database file to the Windows NT registry during the first logon to an
initial installation of Windows NT.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>REGEDT32.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
REGEDT32.EXE is the configuration editor for Windows NT, which is used to
modify the Windows NT configuration database, also known as the Windows NT
Registry. This editor allows you to view or modify the Windows NT Registry.
The editor provides views of windows that represent sections of the
registry, called hives. Each window displays two sections. On the left
side, there are folders that represent registry keys. On the right side,
there are the values associated with the selected registry key. Regedt32 is
a powerful tool, which you must use with extreme caution when changing
registry values. Missing or incorrect values in the registry can render the
Windows NT installation unusable.
<P>
For additional information on Regedit and Regedt32, please see the on-line
Help for these utilities or the Resource Kit Tools Overview Help in the
Windows NT Resource Kit.
