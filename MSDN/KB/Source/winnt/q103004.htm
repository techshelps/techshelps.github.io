<P><h2>Replicator Service Entries</h2>
 
<P>
The Registry path that contains entries for the Replicator service is
the following:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
        \Replicator\Parameters

CrashDir     REG_SZ     First-Level Directory Name
   This item is temporarily recorded in the Registry by the Replicator
   service. If it remains after a system repair, you can delete this
   entry using Registry Editor.

ExportList     REG_SZ     List
   Lists an unlimited number of servers or domains that receive
   notices when the export directory is updated. These servers
   subsequently replicate from the export server. If no List value is
   specified, the export server sends a notice to its domain. Separate
   multiple List names with a semicolon (;). This value is ignored if
   the value of Replicate is 2 (Import).

   Do not use the UNC name when you specify a computer name; that is,
   do not include two backslashes (\\) at the beginning of the name.

   Use the Replicator controls in Server Manager or the Server icon in
   Control Panel to set this value. Default: none.

ExportPath     REG_SZ or REG_EXPAND_SZ     Pathname
   Specifies the export path. All files to be replicated must be in a
   subdirectory of the export directory. This value is ignored if the
   value of Replicate is set to 2 (Import). Use the Replicator
   controls in Server Manager or the Server icon in Control Panel to
   set this value, which cannot be a UNC name.
   Default: %SystemRoot%\System32\Repl\Export.

GuardTime     REG_DWORD     0 to one-half of Interval minutes
   Sets the number of minutes an export directory must be stable (no
   changes to any files) before import servers can replicate its
   files. This option applies only to directories with tree integrity.
   Default: 2 minutes.

ImportList     REG_SZ     List
   Lists an unlimited number of servers or domains that receive
   notices when the import directory is updated. These servers
   subsequently replicate from the import server. If no List value is
   specified, updates come from the import server's domain. Separate
   multiple List names with a semicolon (;). This value is ignored if
   the value of Replicate is 1 (Export).

   Do not use the UNC name when you specify a computer name; that is,
   do not include two backslashes (\\) at the beginning of the name.

   Use the Replicator controls in Server Manager or the Server icon in
   Control Panel to set this value.

ImportPath     REG_SZ or REG_EXPAND_SZ     Pathname
   Specifies the path on the import server to receive replicas from
   the export servers. This value is ignored if the value of Replicate
   is 1 (Export). Use the Replicator controls in Server Manager or the
   Server icon in Control Panel to set this value, which cannot be a
   UNC name. Default: %SystemRoot%\System32\Repl\Import.

Interval     REG_DWORD     1 to 60 minutes
   Sets how often an export server checks the replicated directories
   for changes. This option is ignored on import servers. Default: 5
   minutes.

PulseConcurrency     REG_DWORD     1 to 10 cycles
   Specifies how often the export server repeats sending the last
   update notice. These repeat notices are sent even when no changes
   have occurred, so that import servers that missed the original
   update notice can receive the notice. The server waits the
   equivalent of (Pulse * Interval) minutes before sending each repeat
   notice. Default: 3.

Random     REG_DWORD     1 to 120 seconds
   Specifies the maximum time that the import servers can wait before
   requesting an update. An import server uses the export server’s
   value of Random to generate a random number of seconds (from 0 to
   the value of Random). The import server waits this long after
   receiving an update notice before requesting the replica from the
   export server. This prevents the export server from being
   overloaded by simultaneous update requests. Default: 60.

Replicate     REG_DWORD     1, 2, or 3
   Specifies the Replicator action, according to the following:

   Value          Meaning
   ----------------------
     1            Export-the server maintains a master tree to be
                  replicated.
     2            Import-the server receives update notices from the export
                  server.
     3            Both-the server is to export and import directories or
                  files.

   Use the Replicator controls in Server Manager or the Server icon in
   Control Panel to set this value. Default: 3.

   The Replicator does not use the REPL.INI file as does LAN Manager
   2.0. The integrity and extent values (among other items) are stored
   as REG_SZ values under the Exports and Imports subkeys, which are
   found under the Replicator\Parameters key. These values are used
   only by the software and should be maintained only by the system.

</PRE><h2>RPC and RPCLocator Software Entries</h2>
 
<P>
There are no definable parameters of note in the Services subkey for
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and RPCLocator.
<P>
The important value entries governing RPC are found under the Software
key. There are four subkeys: ClientProtocols, NameService, NetBIOS,
and ServiceProtocols. Entries are described in this section.
<P>
<P><h3>ClientProtocols and ServiceProtocols Entries for RPC</h3>
 
<P>
The ClientProtocols subkey contains the mappings from client-side RPC
protocol name to DLL name. This is the Registry path:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\ClientProtocols

</PRE>The default values are as follows. All data types are REG_SZ.
<P>
<PRE>   ncacn_np =  rpcltc1.dll
   ncacn_ip_tcp =  rpcltc3.dll
   ncacn_nb_nb =  rpcltc5.dll
   ncacn_nb_tcp =  rpcltc5.dll
   ncacn_nb_ipx =  rpcltc5.dll
   ncacn_spx =  rpcltc6.dll
   ncalrpc =  ncalrpc

</PRE>The ServerProtocols subkey does the same for server-side protocols in
this Registry path:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\ServerProtocols

</PRE>The default values are:
<P>
<PRE>   ncacn_np =  rpclts1.dll
   ncacn_ip_tcp =  rpclts3.dll
   ncacn_nb_nb =  rpclts5.dll
   ncacn_nb_tcp =  rpclts5.dll
   ncacn_nb_ipx =  rpclts5.dll
   ncacn_spx =  rpclts6.dll
   ncalrpc =  ncalrps

</PRE>These subkeys are present for all supported RPC transports, but the
mappings for the ncacn_np and ncalrpc protocols are not used. For
these transports, the mapping is hardcoded in the RPC run-time code.
<P>
In the naming convention for the RPC dynamic-link libraries (DLLs):
RPC indicates this is an RPC DLL; LT indicates a loadable transport; C
or S indicates client-side or server-side; and the number indicates
which transport, where 1 = named pipes, 2 = undefined, 3 = TCP/IP, 4 =
DECNet, 5 = NetBIOS, and 6 = SPX.
<P>
NOTE: On 16-bit Windows for MS-DOS systems, these entries in
C:\RPCREG.DAT are a subset of this information. For 16-bit systems, we
rely upon the user to give the proper LANA's to Setup. In addition,
all information in the ClientProtocols section is hardcoded into the
run-time, so the section will typically not be present in RPCREG.DAT.
Finally, a Windows-based application running under the WOW subsystem
will still reference RPCREG.DAT for its parameters, because it does
not have access to the Windows NT Registry.
<P>
<P><h3>NameService Entries for RPC</h3>
 
<P>
The NameService subkey contains information used by the RPC Locator
service and the client-side RPC NSI calls. This is the Registry path:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\NameService

</PRE>The subkeys have the following default values when the Locator is the
name service provider. All are REG_SZ data types.
<P>
<PRE>   DefaultSyntax  =  3
   Protocol =  ncacn_np
   NetworkAddress =  \\.
   ServerNetworkAddress =  \\.
   Endpoint  =  \pipe\locator

</PRE>Because the Locator only listens to \pipe\locator, it is unwise to
change any of the name service values when the Locator is the name
service provider.
<P>
When CDS is the name service provider (via NSID), these entries have
the following values. Again, all are REG_SZ data types.
<P>
<PRE>   DefaultSyntax  =  3
   Protocol =  ncacn_ip_tcp
   NetworkAddress =  hostname.organization.edu
   ServerNetworkAddress =  hostname.organization.edu
   Endpoint =

</PRE>The value for Endpoint is intentionally left blank in this case.
<P>
For these value entries, DefaultSyntax specifies the OSF name syntax
to use when RPC_C_NS_SYNTAX_DEFAULT is specified as the name service
syntax to one of the name service functions. The Locator and NSID
support only the value of 3. Because NSID forwards requests to CDS, it
is possible that NSID actually supports other syntaxes.
<P>
Protocol, NetworkAddress, ServerNetworkAddress, and Endpoint are used
by the system to construct a binding handle to the name service
database and then to make an RPC call to fetch the requested binding
handles.
<P>
When CDS is the provider, the NetworkAddress and ServerNetworkAddress
entry values should be identical. The other entries can be changed,
depending upon the requirements of the NSID implementation. For the
current Digital NSID, the defaults are the best values.
<P>
<P><h3>NetBIOS Entries for RPC</h3>
 
<P>
The NetBIOS subkey describes the mapping of NetBIOS-based protocol
sequences to LANA numbers. The Registry path is:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\NetBIOS

</PRE>Each value has the following form:
<P>
<PRE>   ncacn_nb_baseindex      REG_DWORD     lana

</PRE>In the format for these value entries, base is either nb, ipx, or tcp,
and index and lana are zero-based integers. For example, a computer
might have these entries:
<P>
<PRE>   ncacn_nb_nb0  = 0
   ncacn_nb_ipx0 = 1
   ncacn_nb_tcp0 = 2

</PRE>In this example, IPX is on LANA 1, TCP is on LANA 2, and NetBEUI is on
LANA 0. As another example, if a computer has two network adapter
cards using NetBEUI, the configuration would be the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ncacn_nb_nb0 = 0
   ncacn_nb_nb1 = 1

</PRE>This information is updated by Windows NT Setup to match the installed
network transports, so it should never need to be altered.
<P>
<P><h2>Schedule Service Entries</h2>
 
<P>
There are no parameters that can be added for the Schedule service in
this path:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
        \Schedule

</PRE>You use the Schedule service to submit a job such as an executable or
batch file to run at a later time. You must define access controls on
the Schedule key itself if you want to run in an account that is not
an Administrator account.
