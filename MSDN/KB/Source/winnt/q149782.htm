<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT does not have an "undelete" command or feature. This article
discusses the undelete utility for Windows NT from Executive Software, Inc.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Executive Software has created a utility called "UNDELETE UTILITY FOR
WINDOWS NT 3.51". This utility will undelete files from a Windows NT 3.51
system when the Executive Software DISKEEPER defragmentation utility is
installed. DISKEEPER must be installed since the undelete utility uses
DISKEEPER's file-handling mechanisms to retrieve deleted files.
<P>
