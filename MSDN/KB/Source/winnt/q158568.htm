The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With the release of Windows NT version 4.0, the drivers for certain SCSI
adapters have been moved from the base operating system to the Windows NT
Driver Library included on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM. Check the following
list to determine if any of your adapters are affected by this change. If
your computer has an adapter that appears on this list, you must create a
driver disk before you can use that adapter. Use the driver disk to
install the appropriate driver(s) during Setup, or keep the disk handy
and install the driver once Setup is finished.
<P>
Note that an unattended upgrade can no longer be performed with these
adapters. On x86-based computers, the recommended method of performing
Setup with any of these adapters is to use the three boot floppy disks
with the CD-ROM.
<P>
The following drivers have been moved:

<UL><LI>Always.sys
<LI>Dtc329x.sys
<LI>T128.sys
<LI>T13b.sys
<LI>Tmv1.sys
<LI>Ultra124.sys
<LI>Wd33c93.sys
<P>
</UL>The following adapters are affected by this change:

<UL><LI>Always IN-2000
<LI>Data Technology Corp. 3290
<LI>Maynard 16-bit SCSI Adapter
<LI>MediaVision Pro Audio Spectrum-16
<LI>Trantor T-128
<LI>Trantor T-130B
<LI>UltraStor 124f EISA Disk Array Controller
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create a driver disk for drivers that have been moved to the Driver
Library, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a blank formatted 3.5-inch disk.

<P><LI>Copy all the files from the Drvlib\Storage\Retired\&lt;platform&gt; folder
   to the floppy disk.
<P>
   For enabler drivers, copy the files from the Drvlib\Storage\Fenb
   folder.

<P><LI>Label the disk Driver Disk.
<P>
</OL>To install drivers from the driver disk during Windows NT version 4.0
Setup, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Windows NT Setup.

<P><LI>When you see the "Setup has recognized the following mass storage
   devices in your computer" message, press S to skip detection.

<P><LI>Press S to display a list of supported SCSI host adapters.

<P><LI>Click Other at the bottom of the list.

<P><LI>Insert the Driver Disk you created. Select your host adapter from this
   list.
<P>
   Windows NT will then recognize any devices attached to the adapter.
   Repeat this step for each host adapter not already recognized by
   Windows NT Setup.
<P>
</OL>To install drivers when Setup recognizes one of the supported SCSI host
adapters without making the devices attached to it available for use,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Restart Windows NT Setup.

<P><LI>When Windows NT Setup displays the message "Setup is inspecting your
   computer's hardware configuration..." press F6. This prevents Windows
   NT Setup from performing disk controller detection and allows you to
   install a driver from the Driver Disk you created. Note that all SCSI
   adapters will have to be installed manually.

<P><LI>When Windows NT Setup displays the message "Setup could not determine
   the type of one or more mass storage devices installed in your system,
   or you have chosen to manually specify an adapter" press S to display a
   list of supported SCSI host adapters.

<P><LI>Click Other at the bottom of the list.

<P><LI>Insert the Driver Disk when you are prompted to do so, and select your
   host adapter from the list. Note that in some cases, Windows NT Setup
   will repeatedly prompt you to swap disks.
<P>
   Windows NT will then recognize any devices attached to the adapter.
   Repeat this step for each host adapter not already recognized by
   Windows NT Setup.
<P>
</OL>To install drivers from your Driver Disk after running Windows NT 4.0
Setup, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>After installing the properly configured adapter in your computer,
   start Windows NT version 4.0 as you normally would.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click SCSI Adapters.

<P><LI>Click the Drivers tab, and then click Add.

<P><LI>Click Have Disk, insert your Driver Disk in the appropriate floppy
   disk drive, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click the driver in the list and then click OK. Click Continue to load
   the driver.

<P><LI>Restart the computer.
