<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
The Backup utility included with Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced
Server does not include functionality for scheduling unattended
backups. However, using the Schedule service in conjunction with the
command line capabilities of the Backup utility, you can set up
unattended backups.
<P>
The following procedure shows how to use the Schedule service and the
Backup utility to schedule an unattended backup of the entire C: drive
of a computer with an installed tape device. With minor modifications,
these steps could also allow for scheduling unattended backups from a
computer on a network to a computer with a tape device installed or
other configurations.

<OL><P><LI>Start the Schedule service on the machine with the tape device
   installed. This can be done by using the Services portion of
   Control Panel, selecting Schedule, and choosing Start. In addition,
   you may wish to configure the Schedule service to start every time
   Windows NT starts by choosing Startup and setting the Schedule
   Service Startup Type to Automatic. Please refer to pages 471-472 of
   the Windows Advanced Server System Guide to verify the correct "log
   on" account needed for local and/or remote backup priviliges. For
   Windows NT, please refer to the System Guide pages 177-178.

<P><LI>Using any text editor, such as Notepad, create a command file
   (MYBACKUP.CMD) to perform the commands to backup the requested
   files.
<P>
   The following example would back up all files on the C: drive,
   replacing any files currently on the tape, label the backup set
   "My Backup Files," backup the local registry, and log all backup
   information to C:\BACKUP.LOG:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ntbackup backup c: /D "My Backup Files" /B /L "c:\backup.log"
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: For additional information on available NTBACKUP options,
   search Windows NT Help for NTBACKUP.

<P><LI>Using the AT command, schedule the command file (MYBACKUP.CMD)
   to run when desired. The following AT command will schedule
   MYBACKUP.CMD to execute at 11:00 P.M. every Monday, Wednesday,
   and Friday:
<P>
   AT 23:00 /every:M,W,F MYBACKUP.CMD
<P>
   NOTE: For additional information on available AT options, type "AT /?"
   at a command prompt or search the online Command Reference for AT.
<P>
</OL>More Information
 
<P>
Not all ntbackup operations are available from the command line.  Use of
the GUI interface is required to do restores using ntbackup.  The main
reason for the command line capabilities is for unattended backups of
system data.
