The information in this article applies to:

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to troubleshoot video display in Windows NT
version 4.0. The following items are included with Windows NT to help you
troubleshoot video problems:

<UL><LI>Hardware Compatibility List
<LI>Setup.txt file
<LI>Readme.wri file
<LI>Video drivers from other manufacturers
<LI>VGA mode
<LI>The ability to easily change display settings
<LI>Last Known Good Configuration
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Hardware Compatibility List</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows NT 4.0 Hardware Compatibility List is available in the
Support folder on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM as a file named Hcl.hlp. The
Hardware Compatibility List is a listing of computers and peripherals
that have passed compatibility testing with Windows NT 4.0. Before you
install Windows NT or if you are experiencing problems with your video
adapter, make sure your video adapter appears on this list.
<P>
Although your video adapter may not appear on the Hardware Compatibility
List, it may work with Windows NT. If a device does not appear on the
Hardware Compatibility List, Microsoft does not guarantee the device will
work properly with Windows NT.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q142865.htm">Q142865</A></B>
   TITLE     : Microsoft Support Policy on Hardware Not On Windows NT HCL

</PRE><h3>Setup.txt and Readme.wri Files</h3>
 
<P>
If your video adapter appears on the Hardware Compatibility List and you
continue to experience problems, check for information concerning your
video adapter in the Setup.txt and Readme.wri files.
<P>
The Setup.txt file is available in the I386 folder on the Windows NT 4.0
CD-ROM and the Readme.wri file is available in the Winnt\System32 folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Video Drivers from Other Manufacturers</h3>
 
<P>
If your video adapter appears on the Hardware Compatibility List,
additional information is not available in the Setup.txt or Readme.wri
file, and you continue to experience problems, check the Drvlib\Video
folder on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM for an updated video driver.
<P>
This folder contains video drivers written by third-party manufacturers
for their video adapters that are provided for your convenience. If you
have a question concerning any of these drivers, please contact the
manufacturer of that driver. If these adapters are not detected during
Setup, the standard VGA driver is installed.
<P>
Perform the following steps to manually add one of these drivers:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Display.

<P><LI>Click the Settings tab, click Display Type, and then click Change.

<P><LI>Click Have Disk and then click Browse to browse the Windows NT CD-ROM
   for the appropriate video driver for your display adapter.

<P><LI>After you locate the appropriate video driver, click OK, read the
   message about third-party hardware vendors, and then click Yes.

<P><LI>Click Reboot when you are prompted.
<P>
</OL>Drivers for the following adapters and chip sets are in the Drvlib\Video
folder on the CD-ROM:

</PRE></OL><h3>VGA Mode</h3>
 
<P>
If Windows NT does not start or if distorted or unreadable text appears
on the screen, start your computer using VGA mode. By default, the
Windows NT boot loader menu offers options to start normally or in VGA
mode. To force Windows NT to use the standard VGA driver, choose the VGA
Mode option.
<P>
If VGA mode works correctly, please see the "The Ability to Easily Change
Display Settings" section in this article. If VGA mode is unsuccessful,
please see the "Last Known Good Configuration" section in this article.
<P>
<P><h3>The Ability to Easily Change Display Settings</h3>
 
<P>
If VGA mode lets you run Windows NT, changing the display settings may
let you run Windows NT normally. The following three display settings, if
set incorrectly for your video adapter or monitor, may prevent Windows NT
from loading:

<UL><LI>Color Palette
<LI>Desktop Area
<LI>Refresh Frequency
<P>
</UL>NOTE: The Font Size setting affects only the size of the text on the
screen. It does not prevent Windows NT from loading.
<P>
Perform the following steps to change display settings:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Display.

<P><LI>Click the Settings tab.

<P><LI>Try each of the following steps, restarting Windows NT after each
   change, until Windows NT starts normally. Repeat the steps as
   necessary.
<P>
   a. Reduce the Color Palette setting. To do so, click a lower setting
<P><PRE>      in the Color Palette box.
</PRE><P>
   b. Reduce the desktop area. To do so, move the Desktop Area slider to
<P><PRE>      the left.
</PRE><P>
   c. Reduce the refresh rate. The current setting may be too high for
<P><PRE>      your monitor. To reduce this setting, click a slower refresh rate
      in the Refresh Frequency box.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Last Known Good Configuration</h3>
 
<P>
If Windows NT does not start in VGA mode, start Windows NT using the last
known good configuration. To do so, restart your computer and press the
SPACEBAR when you see the "Press spacebar NOW to invoke Hardware
Profile/Last Known Good menu" message. The last known good configuration
works only if you have not successfully logged on since the problem
began.
<P>
If the last known good configuration works, see the "Driver" section in
this article. If the last known good configuration does not work, try to
recover your system with the Emergency Repair Disk. Please see your
Windows NT documentation for more information about the Emergency Repair
Disk.
<P>
<P><h3>Driver</h3>
 
<P>
If the last known good configuration works, there may be a problem with
the installed video driver. Please consult the video adapter manufacturer
for a possible video driver update.
<P>
NOTE: Because of changes to the Windows NT 4.0 video subsystem, most
Windows NT 3.x video drivers do not work in Windows NT 4.0.
