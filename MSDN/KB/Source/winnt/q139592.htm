The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server Enterprise Edition version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to connect to a Windows NT-based computer, you may
receive one of the following messages:

<UL><LI>Incorrect password or unknown username for:

<LI>You must supply a password to make this connection.

<LI>\\&lt;ComputerName&gt;\&lt;ShareName&gt; is not accessible. Access Denied.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur when all of the following conditions exist:

<UL><LI>The Guest account is disabled on the Windows NT-based computer you are
   attempting to connect to.

<LI>The user name and password you are using are not contained in the local
   user accounts database of the Windows NT-based computer you are
   attempting to connect to.

<LI>If the computer you are attempting to connect to is a member of a
   domain, the user name and password you are using are not contained in
   that domain's user accounts database.
<P>
</UL>Windows NT uses your logon information (your user name and password) for
authentication when you attempt to connect to a network resource.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use the appropriate method:
<P>
<P><h3>Enable the Guest Account</h3>
 
<P>
Use the User Manager tool to enable the Guest account on the Windows NT-
based computer that you are attempting to connect to. To do so, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, click Administrative Tools (Common),
   and then click User Manager or User Manager For Domains.

<P><LI>In the Username box, double-click Guest.

<P><LI>Click the Account Disabled check box to clear it, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>Set Up User Accounts in the Local Accounts Database
 
<P>
Use the User Manager tool to set up user accounts in the local accounts
database of the Windows NT-based computer that you are attempting to
connect to. These user accounts need to contain the same logon information
(user name and password) that is used when a user logs on to his or her
computer.
<P>
Set Up User Accounts in the Domain Accounts Database
 
<P>
Use the User Manager For Domains and Server Manager tools to configure
accounts for your domain. In a domain environment, you typically add users
to the centralized domain accounts database and not to the local accounts
database.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the Guest account is disabled in Windows NT Workstation 4.0
and all versions of Windows NT Server. In earlier versions of Windows NT
Workstation, the Guest account is enabled by default.
