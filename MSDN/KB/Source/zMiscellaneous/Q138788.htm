The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 98
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 reports random "Fatal Exception Error 0x:xxxxxxxx" error
messages even though your previous version of Windows or Windows for
Workgroups did not.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A common cause for these error messages is faulty physical memory (RAM) on
the computer. The following are reasons why your previous version of
Windows may appear to run smoothly while Windows 95 may report random
"Fatal Exception Error 0x:xxxxxxxx" error messages:

<UL><LI>All operating systems use memory differently. In Windows 3.1, the "bad"
   memory may be used for holding rarely used data. In Windows 95, the
   "bad" memory is used for holding frequently run program information.

<LI>Windows 3.1 contains comparatively little 32-bit code. Windows 95 uses
   much more 32-bit code. Furthermore, there are subtle differences
   between the way memory is accessed if it is being accessed for code or
   if it being accessed for data. Because Windows 95 runs much more
   32-bit code, these subtle errors show up more often.
<P>
   In particular, all the 32-bit code in Windows 3.1 resides in one place:
   at the low-end of physical memory. If the first 4 megabytes (MB) of
   memory can handle 32-bit code, Windows 3.1 works without errors. This is
   true even if the topmost physical memory cannot run 32-bit code because
   Windows 3.1 does not run 32-bit code outside the first 4 MB of RAM.
<P>
   Windows 95 runs 32-bit code in all portions of memory. Therefore,
   when Windows 95 runs 32-bit code in a section of RAM that cannot
   run 32-bit code well, you may receive "Fatal Exception Error
   0x:xxxxxxxx" error messages.

<LI>Windows 95 interacts with hardware differently than previous versions
   of Windows. This is due partly to Plug and Play and partly to new
   drivers that take advantage of the additional capabilities of interface
   adapters. These features may uncover anomalies in the hardware that
   never appeared in previous versions of Windows because earlier versions
   did not attempt to exploit these features.

<LI>Many new computers do not have memory chips that perform parity
   checking; therefore, you may have been encountering parity errors in
   Windows 3.1 without realizing it because the errors were in
   relatively harmless sections of memory. For example, in a Microsoft
   Word for Windows document, the word "the" is changed to "tie."
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve these errors, it is often necessary to replace the RAM and/or
system board (motherboard). In some circumstances it may be possible to
alter CMOS settings, such as Memory Wait States, to run Windows 95
successfully. In other cases, disabling the motherboard L2 cache allows
Windows 95 to run. For information about how to edit CMOS settings, please
view your computer documentation or contact your hardware manufacturer.
<P>
Note that you may want to restart Windows 95 in Safe mode to see if the
errors persist. If they do not, the problem may be a software or driver
problem, in which case the information above may not apply. For
information about how to troubleshoot Windows 95 using Safe mode, see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Fatal exception errors are similar to EMM386 exception errors. For
example, fatal exception error 0C is generally equivalent to EMM386
exception error 12 or a stack fault. For more information on exception
errors, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
