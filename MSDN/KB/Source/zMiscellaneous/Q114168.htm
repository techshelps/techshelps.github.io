The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a series of questions you can use to troubleshoot
problems converting from a foreign file format in Word for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>General Troubleshooting</h3>
 

<UL><LI>How much hard disk space is available?
<P>
<P><PRE>     The amount of free disk space should be approximately 20 MB or
     higher.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     Note: There is no specific minimum amount of free disk space required
     to run Office applications.  However, most PC systems do require a
     certain amount of free space to perform file I\O and printing
     functions.  20 MB is a general recommendation.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     If your hard disk has less than 20 MB of free disk space available,
     you should consider removing unused data files, temporary files or
     programs. Once you have cleared 20 MB or more on your primary hard
     disk, restart windows and re-open the affected file.
</PRE>
<LI>How much RAM is available on your computer?
<P>
<P><PRE>     Make sure it at least meets the minimum requirements for the
     applications you are running.
</PRE>
<LI>How much RAM is allocated to specific devices?
<P>
<P><PRE>     For example, how much RAM is allocated to SMARTDrive and/or RAMDrive
     in Windows 3.x? What are the BITMAPCACHE and/or CACHESIZE settings in
     the WIN.INI file (Word 2.x), WINWORD6.INI file (Word 6.0x), or the
     registry (Word 7.0x and Word 97)?
</PRE>
<LI>Is the SET TEMP statement valid?

<LI>Is there a TEMP directory?

<LI>Is the TEMP directory located where the SET TEMP statement indicates it
   should be?

<LI>In Word, check to see if the converter in question is working by
   following these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>     1. Open a new Word document.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     2. Type "Have a nice day."
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     3. Save in the foreign format desired.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     4. Reopen the file in Word.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     Note: If the converter is import only, try opening another document
     that is in the same foreign file format.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>Working with the File</h3>
 

<UL><LI>From where did the file originate?

<LI>Can the creator application open the file? For example, can WordPerfect
   still open the WordPerfect file?

<LI>What's in the document (graphics, text only, tables, equations, memo
   fields, objects, and so on)?

<LI>Repaginate the document in the originating application, resave it, and
   then open it in Word.

<LI>Can Word for Windows open ANY files made by the creator application?

<LI>If possible, create a new document in the source application. Can Word
   open the new document?

<LI>Can you convert any part of the problem file? Cut and paste a portion
   of the document into a new file and try converting it.

<LI>Is the file damaged?  Save the file in RTF file format, reopen the RTF
   file, save the RTF file in the originating format. (In Word, you could
   also try to cut and paste all but the last paragraph mark into a new
   document.)
<P>
<P><PRE>     For more information on dealing with damaged files, please see the
     following article in the Microsoft Knowledge:
</PRE><P>

     TITLE: Troubleshooting Damaged Documents in Word for Windows
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>Opening a Document from a Foreign Format</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Is the conversion just going so slow it appears as if the file is not
   converting? (Do you still see the status bar?)

<LI>What conversion choice does Word choose for you after selecting Open
   from the File menu?

<LI>Is the correct converter installed? To see a list of the currently
   installed converters,
<P>
<P><PRE>     In Word 1.x - 6.0x:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        1. On the File menu, click Open.

        2. Turn on the Confirm Conversions checkbox.

        3. Open a non-Word document.

     In Word 7.0 - 97:

       1. On the Tools menu click Options

       2. Click on the General tab.

       3. Turn on the Confirm Conversion at Open checkbox.

       4. Open a non-Word document.

     Word displays the Convert File dialog box, showing all of the
     installed import converters.

</PRE><LI>Is the converter (*.CNV file)and any supporting DLLs in the correct
   location? The files should be in the \TEXTCONV directory or in the
   program directory.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h3>Supplemental Converters</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Is there a supplemental converter available? For information on
   obtaining supplemental converters, please see the following articles in
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>     ARTICLE ID: <B><A HREF="../zzMiscellaneous/Q104949.htm">Q104949</A></B>
     TITLE: Supported Foreign File Formats in WinWord 6.0 / 6.0a / 6.0c

     TITLE: Word 6.0 for Windows Supplemental File Conversions Disks
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     ARTICLE ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q136385.htm">Q136385</A></B>
     TITLE: Supported Foreign File Formats in Word and Office 95
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     ARTICLE ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q162987.htm">Q162987</A></B>
     TITLE: Word 97: Supported Non-Word File Formats
</PRE><P>
</UL>- Does the INI file or registry reflect the correct path and filename for
<PRE>  the converter?

     Word 2.x - Check the [MSWord Text Converters] section of the WIN.INI.

     Word 6.0 - Check the [MS Text Converters] section of the WIN.INI file
     for shared text converters or the [MSWord Text Converters] section of
     the WINWORD6.INI file for Word specific converters.

     Word 7.0x - See the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
     Base:
         ARTICLE ID: <B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q135783</A></B>
         TITLE: Converter Registration and File Locations in Word/Office
                95

     Word 97 - See the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
     Base:

         ARTICLE ID: <B><A HREF="../WORD/Q157464.htm">Q157464</A></B>
         TITLE: Where Settings Are Stored in the Registry

</PRE><LI>Does the [Extensions] section of the WIN.INI file have a DLL or CNV
   entry--for example, "dll=toolbook.exe ^.doc" or "cnv=write.exe ^.cnv"
   (without the quotation marks)?
<P>
</UL><h3>Saving a Document in a Foreign Format</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Is the correct converter installed?

<LI>Is the document really a template with a .DOC file extension? If
   "Document Template (*.dot)" is unavailable (dimmed) in the Save As File
   Type box, then it's a template.

<LI>Are the extensions incorrect?
<P>
   For Windows 3.x
<P><PRE>       Does the [extensions] section of the WIN.INI file have a DLL or CNV
       entry--for example, "dll=toolbook.exe ^.doc" or "cnv=write.exe
       ^.cnv" (without the quotation marks)? Remove the line from the
       WIN.INI file if it does, and restart windows.
</PRE><P>
   For Windows 95
<P><PRE>       Does the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT hive of the registry have an association
       for CNV? If it does, remove the key from the registry.
</PRE>
<LI>Are there other desktop shells running?

<LI>Is the conversion just going so slow that it appears as if the file is
   not converting? (Do you still see the status bar?)
<P>
