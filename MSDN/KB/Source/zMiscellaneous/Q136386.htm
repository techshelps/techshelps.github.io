The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.2, 4.3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following process is how Find Fast determines which files to index on 
specified local and network writable media:

<OL><P><LI>File Name Extension:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. If you choose to index Microsoft Office files, including 
       Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, Microsoft Project and 
       Binder Files, Find Fast enumerates (makes a list of) all files 
       matching these file name extensions on the specified drive.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. If you choose to index all files, Find Fast enumerates all of the
       files in and below the selected directory with the exception of 
       files matching the "exclude" extension list.
</PRE> 
<P><LI>Find Fast then calls the OLE 2.0 GetClassFile function on every file
   matching the criterion specified in step 1 above to determine the
   file's Class ID.
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. If the Class ID identifies the file as a Word 6.0-7.0, Microsoft
       Excel 2.1-7.0, PowerPoint 7.0, or Office 95 Binder file, Find Fast
       uses its internal Word, Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, or Binder 
       filter to parse the file.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. If a file is identified as a Microsoft Project file, Find Fast uses
       its internal text filter to parse the file.
</PRE> 
<P><LI>If Find Fast does not recognize the Class ID, Find Fast then queries 
   the Windows 95 Registration Database to determine if any external 
   converters that support running in NoDialogs mode are installed. Find 
   Fast then polls each registered NoDialogs converter that expects 
   (recognizes) the file extension of that particular file. If a converter 
   recognizes the file, the converter will be used to parse the file. 

<P><LI>If a file does not have a Class ID that is recognized by Find Fast, 
   does not include a file extension, does not have a file extension 
   expected by any of the installed external NoDialogs converters, or does 
   not have a format that is recognized by the converter(s) that supports 
   its file extension, Find Fast reverts to use of its internal text 
   filter to parse the file. 
<P>
</OL>If a file is filtered by Find Fast's text filter, but the file does not 
include any intelligible textual data, Find Fast will still index the file, 
but truncate any "words" over 80 characters. 
<P>
NOTE: The following file name extensions comprise Find Fast's "exclude"
extension list. Find Fast will never index files with these extensions
because these extensions denote file types that will not include useful
textual data for indexing purposes:
<P>
.386, .BMP, .CHK, .COM, .DLL, .DRV, .EXE, .FFA, .FFL, .FFX, .FLT, .FRX,
.FTS, .GRP, .ICM, .ICO, .IDX, .JPG, .LEX, .MAP, .MMF, .NSF, .OBJ, .OBX,
.PAR, .SCR, .SWP, .SYS, .TIF, .TTF, .VBX, .VXD, .WAV, .WMF, .WPC
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Find Fast is installed by Office 95 Setup for access through the 
   Windows 95 Control Panel.

<LI>Office Extensions include:
<P>
<PRE>      Extension              File type
      ---------              ---------
      .DOC, .DOT             Microsoft Word 6.0 or 7.0 document
      .XL*                   Microsoft Excel Workbooks
      .PPT, .POT             Microsoft PowerPoint Presentations
      .MPP, MPW, .MPT, .MPX  Microsoft Project files
      .OBD, .OBT             Binder files

</PRE><LI>The method of file name extension enumeration that Find Fast uses is the 
   same method all Office applications use to populate the list of files in 
   the File Open dialog.

<LI>As stated above, Find Fast includes its own internal Word 6.0-7.0,
   Microsoft Excel 2.1-7.0, PowerPoint 7.0, Binder, and Text filters.

<LI>"NoDialogs" mode is a mode during which an external text converter will
   not echo any dialogs to the screen. For example, if a converter would
   normally prompt for a missing linked graphic, it will not do so when
   called in NoDialogs mode. Converters that support NoDialogs mode can
   include a sub-key in the Windows 95 registry titled "NoDialogs". When a
   converter is set up, the default of the following converters is to be
   set with NoDialogs mode:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Excel 3.x-7.0
      Lotus 1-2-3 2.x-4.0
      RFT-DCA
      Word 2.x for Windows
      Works 3.x for Windows
      Word 4.x-5.x for the Macintosh
      Works 4.0 for Windows
      WordPerfect 5.x
      WordPerfect 6.x
      WordStar
</PRE><P>
   Although the Excel 3.x-7.0 converter supports NoDialogs mode, it is not
   used by Find Fast, given Find Fast includes its own internal Excel
   2.1-7.0 filter.
<P>
   The Word 2.x for Windows and Word 4.x-5.x for the Macintosh converters
   are not used by Word 7.0 for Windows for import because Word translates
   these older file types internally. These converters are, however,
   capable of import and are registered as import converters for and used
   by Find Fast for this purpose.
<P>

<LI>Word identifies some third-party file formats by scanning the first few
   bytes in their file headers. Find Fast does not support this method of
   recognition for third-party formats. Therefore, a foreign document that
   does not include a file extension recognized by any of the installed
   NoDialogs external converters will be processed by Find Fast's internal
   text filter.
<P>
   For example, a WordPerfect 5.x document with no file extension will be
   processed by Find Fast's text converter because the WordPerfect 6.x
   import converter expects either a .DOC or .WPD file extension.

<LI>No converters other than those converters installed with Word or Office
   95 that support NoDialogs mode will be utilized by Find Fast. This
   means that no 16-bit Windows 3.x converters or converters included with
   Word 6.0 for Windows NT or its associated Supplemental Conversions Disk
   will be used, unless the NoDialogs sub key is added.  However, if this
<PRE>   sub key is added to a converter that does not support the no dialogs
   flag, the result may be dialogs that come up during indexing, even if
   Find Fast is running in the background without an application window.
   This can cause erroneous behavior in both Find Fast and the converter.

</PRE><LI>For additional information on which converters are installed with each
   Word and Office Setup type and will therefore be available to Find 
   Fast, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
