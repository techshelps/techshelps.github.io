<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Project 98 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Project for Windows 95, versions 4.1, 4.1a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Project when you close or save a file, you may receive the
following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Error Reading Disk in Drive A:

      Please Insert Disk
      With Serial Number 0000-0000 in Drive A:

   Press ENTER for OK or ESC to Cancel: OK

</PRE>where A is one of the floppy disk drives in your computer.
<P>
Additionally, if you wait too long to respond to this error message, your
computer stops responding (hangs), and you must turn it off and on again to
return to Windows. This problem does not occur under Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs with a file that you have saved to a floppy disk if you
do any of the following:

<UL><LI>Remove the floppy disk while the file is still open in Microsoft
   Project and then close the project or close Microsoft Project

<LI>Save the file to a different floppy disk while the file is still open in
   Microsoft Project

<LI>Remove the floppy disk while the file is still being saved
<P>
</UL>When you perform any of these steps, you receive the "Error Reading Disk"
error message and you are prompted to press either ENTER or ESC. If you
wait too long to respond to this error message, your computer hangs, and
you must turn your computer off to start Windows again.
<P>
This problem occurs when Microsoft Project attempts to access a file on a
floppy disk when that floppy disk (and file) is no longer available. A file
is open on a floppy disk while the file is open in Microsoft Project. If
Microsoft Project is attempting to close or save a file on a floppy disk,
and the floppy disk is no longer in the drive, your receive the error
message described above.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid having your computer hang when you receive this error message, use
either of the following methods:
<P>
<PRE>Method 1:   When you receive this error message, quickly press the ESC key.

Method 2:   When you receive this error message, quickly insert the floppy
            disk that contains the file back in the floppy disk drive and
            press ENTER.

</PRE>To avoid receiving this error message at all, close any files in Microsoft
Project that are located on a floppy disk before you remove the disk from
the floppy drive. Note that this means that you cannot save a file from one
floppy disk to another floppy disk using the same floppy disk drive. You
must first transfer the file to your hard disk or to a floppy disk in
another drive.
