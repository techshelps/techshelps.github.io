<P><h2>DO YOU NEED TO REPARTITION?</h2>
 
<P>
In most cases, you don't need to repartition your hard disk to install
MS-DOS version 6.0 or 6.2. You need to repartition your hard disk only
if:

<UL><LI>The primary DOS partition on your hard disk is too small (less than
   2 megabytes [MB]).
<LI>The size of the clusters or sectors on your hard disk is
   incompatible with MS-DOS version 6.0 or 6.2.
<LI>There are more than four primary partitions on your hard disk.
<LI>The primary DOS partition is inaccessible.
<LI>A disk-partitioning program that is not compatible with the Setup
   program for MS-DOS was used to partition your hard disk.
<LI>Your primary DOS partition is incompatible with the Setup program
   for MS-DOS. (This may be the case if you receive an error message
   when trying to run Setup.)
<P>
</UL>If you don't need to repartition your hard disk for any of the
preceding reasons, but you still would like to, see "Optionally
Repartitioning Your Hard Disk" at the end of this document. If you
have determined that you cannot install MS-DOS version 6.0 or 6.2
without repartitioning your hard disk, use the procedures in the
"Preparing to Repartition" section.
<P>
<PRE>   Warning: Once you repartition your hard disk, you can no longer use
   the Uninstall disk to return to your previous version of MS-DOS.

</PRE><h2>PREPARING TO REPARTITION</h2>
 
<P>
Before you partition your hard disk, you need the following:

<UL><LI>Enough floppy disks to back up your hard disk. Make sure your
   floppy disks are newly formatted.
<LI>A single floppy disk on which to install MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2.
<P>
</UL>Repartitioning your hard disk involves:

<UL><LI>Creating an MS-DOS Startup disk
<LI>Backing up your hard disk
<LI>Repartitioning your hard disk by using the Fdisk program
<LI>Formatting your hard disk
<LI>Restoring your backed-up files
<LI>Upgrading your system to MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2
<P>
   Warning: If you are using software such as Disk Manager,
   SpeedStor(R), Priam(R), or Everex to replace the BIOS in
   interactions between MS-DOS and the hard disk controller, do not
   repartition your hard disk with the MS-DOS Fdisk program. Instead,
   use the disk-partitioning program you originally used to partition
   your hard disk.
<P>
   To determine whether you have one of these disk-partitioning
   programs on your computer, search for the following files:
   DMDRVR.BIN (Disk Manager), SSTOR.SYS (SpeedStor), HARDRIVE.SYS
   (Priam), and EVDISK.SYS (Everex). If you need help in
   repartitioning your hard disk or are unsure whether the BIOS is
   being replaced, contact the manufacturer of your original disk-
   partitioning software.
<P>
</UL><h3>Creating a Startup Disk</h3>
 
<P>
Begin by creating an MS-DOS version 6.0 or 6.2 Startup disk. To do so:

<OL><P><LI>Start your computer with your current version of MS-DOS.

<P><LI>Insert MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 Setup Disk 1 in drive A.

<P><LI>Type A:SETUP /F at the MS-DOS command prompt, press ENTER, and then
   follow the instructions on your screen.
<P>
   Setup expands key MS-DOS files onto your floppy disk. You'll use
   this floppy disk with the expanded files to temporarily run MS-DOS
   version 6.0 or 6.2.
<P>
</OL><h3>Backing Up Your Files</h3>
 
<P>
You should back up files on every partition and each logical drive of
your hard disk.
<P>
<PRE>   Warning: Make sure you back up your files before using the Fdisk
   program. When you delete or modify a partition, all files on that
   partition are deleted.

</PRE></OL>Use the MS-DOS BACKUP command to back up all the files on your hard
disk to a floppy disk by typing the following at the MS-DOS command
prompt and pressing ENTER
<P>
<PRE>      backup &lt;drive&gt;:\*.* &lt;floppy&gt;: /s

</PRE>where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard disk drive and &lt;floppy&gt; is your floppy disk
drive. The /S switch specifies that every file in every directory will
be backed up. For example, to back up every file in every directory on
hard disk drive C onto disks in floppy disk drive A, type the
following command and press ENTER:
<P>
<PRE>      backup c:\*.* a: /s

   NOTE: Use the backup command to back up files on every partition
   and each logical drive of your hard disk.

</PRE>You can use your current version of the MS-DOS BACKUP command because
it should be compatible with the RESTORE command provided with MS-DOS
6.0 and 6.2. Because MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2 include the full-screen
version of Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS and Microsoft Backup for
Windows, the MS-DOS command prompt version of BACKUP is not included
with the product. However, the RESTORE command is still provided.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: Before using your current version of the backup command and
   repartitioning, you should back up a few files and use the restore
   command provided with MS-DOS 6 Upgrade or MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade to
   restore the files. This should be done as a safety precaution to
   ensure you are not using an original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
   version of backup that is not compatible with the MS-DOS restore
   command.

</PRE>If you do not want to use BACKUP and RESTORE, you can use a third-
party backup program such as Fastback, Norton Utilities(R) Backup, PC
Tools Backup, and so forth.
<P>
<P><h3>Repartitioning Your Hard Disk</h3>
 
<P>
Repartitioning your hard disk involves:
<P>
<PRE>    - Deleting any non-DOS partitions
    - Deleting the logical drives in the extended DOS partition, if
      your system has any
    - Deleting the extended DOS partition, if your system has one
    - Deleting any primary DOS partitions
    - Creating a new primary DOS partition
    - Specifying the maximum disk size for the partition, and making
      the partition active

</PRE>Before you repartition your hard disk, make sure you write down the
volume label for each partition. You will need this information later.
To find the volume label for your hard disk drive, type the following
at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER
<P>
<PRE>   vol &lt;drive&gt;:

</PRE>where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard disk drive. For example, if you want to
determine the volume label for drive C, type the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   vol c:

</PRE>To repartition your hard disk:

<OL><P><LI> If you are not already running MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2, insert your
<P><PRE>    Startup disk in drive A, and then restart your computer by
    pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.
</PRE>
<P><LI> If you have not already done so, insert the Startup disk (which
<P><PRE>    you created using the procedure in the "Creating a Startup Disk"
    section) in drive A.
</PRE>
<P><LI> At the MS-DOS command prompt, type FDISK and press ENTER. The
<P><PRE>    FDISK Options screen appears.

<P>
You cannot use your hard disk until you format it.
<P>
To format your hard disk:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure you are running MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 from your Startup disk.

<P><LI>Type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      format &lt;drive&gt;: /s
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard disk drive. For example, if your hard
   disk drive is drive C, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      format c: /s
</PRE>
<P><LI>Press Y and press ENTER to proceed with formatting.

<P><LI>Once formatting is complete, type a volume label if you want one
   and press ENTER.
<P>
</OL><h3>Restoring Your Files</h3>
 
<P>
Now you can restore the files you backed up previously. If you used a
third-party program such as Fastback to back up your files, use the
same program to restore your files. If you used the MS-DOS BACKUP
command, use the MS-DOS RESTORE command to restore them.
<P>
To restore your files using the MS-DOS RESTORE command:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Startup disk in drive A.

<P><LI>Type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      restore &lt;drive1&gt;: &lt;drive2&gt;:\*.* /s
</PRE><P>
   where&lt; drive1&gt; specifies the drive on which the backed-up files are
   stored and &lt;drive2&gt; is your hard disk drive. For example, if you
   insert your backup disk in drive A and your hard disk drive is
   drive C, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      restore a: c:\*.* /s
</PRE><P>
   The /S switch restores every file in every subdirectory you backed
   up.

<P><LI>Insert your Startup disk if you are prompted with the following
   message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Insert disk with \COMMAND.COM in drive A
</PRE>
<P><LI>Repeat steps 2 and 3 if you have other backup disks. For example,
   you might have a set of backup disks for drive D.
<P>
</OL><h3>Upgrading to MS-DOS 6.0 or MS-DOS 6.2</h3>
 
<P>
Now you can upgrade your system to MS-DOS version 6.0 or 6.2. To
upgrade:

<OL><P><LI>Insert Setup Disk 1 in drive A.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type A:SETUP and press ENTER.

<P><LI>Continue following the instructions on the screen to install
   MS-DOS.
<P>
   NOTE: Before you restart your system, make sure drive A is empty.
<P>
</OL><h3>Optionally Repartitioning Your Hard Disk</h3>
 
<P>
If you don't need to repartition your hard disk in order to install MS-
DOS version 6.0 or 6.2, follow the steps outlined here. You have two
choices when optionally repartitioning your hard disk:

<UL><LI>Use your current version of the MS-DOS BACKUP and RESTORE commands
   to back up your hard disk when preparing to partition.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>First install MS-DOS version 6.0 or 6.2 in order to use the
   Microsoft Backup program (MSBACKUP) when preparing to partition.
<P>
   While this option requires that you install MS-DOS twice (once
   before and once after you partition), using the Microsoft Backup
   program provides you with many more options when backing up your
   data.
<P>
</UL>To partition your hard disk by using MS-DOS version 6.0 or 6.2:

<OL><P><LI> Insert Setup Disk 1 (the first of your installation disks) in
<P><PRE>    drive A.
</PRE>
<P><LI> At the MS-DOS command prompt, type A:SETUP, press ENTER, and then
<P><PRE>    follow the instructions in the first few screens. At the screen
    that begins with "The following programs can be installed on your
    computer," note the default setting for "Backup." This setting
    will be either Windows Only or MS-DOS Only.
</PRE>
<P><LI> If you have Microsoft Windows installed on your personal computer,
<P><PRE>    change the Backup setting to include MS-DOS. You can choose either
    the Backup: MS-DOS Only option or the Backup: Windows And MS-DOS
    option.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Continue following the instructions to install MS-DOS.

<P><LI> Before you restart your system, make sure drive A is empty.

<P><LI> Insert Setup Disk 1 (the first of your installation disks) in
<P><PRE>    drive A.
</PRE>
<P><LI> To create a startup floppy disk called Startup, type A:SETUP /F at
<P><PRE>    the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER. Follow the instructions
    on the screen.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Run the Microsoft Backup program by typing MSBACKUP at the MS-DOS
<P><PRE>    command prompt and pressing ENTER. Create full backups of all the
    partitions on your hard disk.
</PRE>
<P><LI> At the MS-DOS command prompt, type FDISK and press ENTER. This
<P><PRE>    initiates the procedure to partition your hard disk. Refer to
    "Using Fdisk to Configure Your Hard Disk" in Chapter 8 of the
    Microsoft MS-DOS 6 "User's Guide".
</PRE>
<P><LI>Insert the Startup disk (which you created in step 7) in drive A
<P><PRE>    and format all of your partitions. When formatting your hard disk
    drive, use the /S switch (this transfers system files to your hard
    disk drive, making it the startup drive). For example, type the
    following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      format &lt;drive&gt;: /s
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard disk drive. For example, if your hard
    disk drive is drive C, type the following command:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      format c: /s
</PRE>
<P><LI>Install MS-DOS on your newly partitioned hard disk. Be sure to
<P><PRE>    install the MS-DOS version of the Microsoft Backup program.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run Microsoft Backup to restore your data by typing MSBACKUP at
<P><PRE>    the MS-DOS command prompt and pressing ENTER. If you used the
    MS-DOS Backup program to back up your data, use the MS-DOS
    RESTORE command to restore it.
