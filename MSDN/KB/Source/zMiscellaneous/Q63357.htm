The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To debug printing problems from Microsoft Windows on a Novell NetWare
network, use the checklist provided in this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Do you have a valid SET TEMP statement?
<P>
   Windows cannot print correctly unless the DOS TEMP variable is
   set to a valid directory to which you have Create, Write, and
   Delete access privileges.

<P><LI>Are you using a proper Windows printer configuration?
<P>
   Verify that the correct Windows printer driver is installed and
   that the appropriate port is selected for output.

<P><LI>Do you have the correct NetWare shell version?
<P>
   Windows 3.0 and 3.0a require IPX.COM and NETx.COM version
   3.02a or later.
<P>
   Windows 3.1 requires IPX.COM version 3.1 and NETX.COM version 3.26.
<P>
   You can obtain the latest versions of these files from NetWare dealers,
   the Novell LANswer Technical Support group, or from the Novell area on
   CompuServe.

<P><LI>Is the Windows NetWare driver installed?
<P>
   Run the Windows SETUP utility icon from Program Manager and check
   that "Novell NetWare" is shown as the installed network driver.
   Windows is not able to print correctly on a Novell network if
   no network driver or an incorrect network driver is installed.

<P><LI>Is the workstation printing utility installed?
<P>
   Windows does not work properly with NetWare printing utilities
   that allow one workstation to print to a printer connected to
   another workstation. For proper Windows operation, the network
   printer must be connected to a server.

<P><LI>Are you using the proper NetWare print configuration?
<P>
   Windows requires proper NetWare print console configuration for
   successful printing on Novell networks. This configuration can
   be carried out in one of two ways. The best way is for the
   system administrator to verify that the server Print Console
   configuration is set correctly by using the supervisor PRINTCON
   utility.
<P>
   In PRINTCON, perform an Edit Print Job Configuration and make sure
   the following options are set. Options not listed are not relevant
   to proper Windows printing.
<P>
<PRE>      PRINTCON Option          Setting
      --------------------------------

      Suppress Form Feed       Yes
      File Contents            Byte Stream
      Print Banner             No
      Auto Endcap              No
      Enable Timeout           No

   Windows always places a formfeed at the end of its print jobs.
   Suppress Form Feed should be set to Yes so NetWare does not add an
   additional formfeed, thus wasting a sheet of paper. Because Windows
   is printing bitmap graphics in almost all cases, File Contents must
   be set to Byte Stream to avoid NetWare's automatic expansion of tab
   characters. Byte values resembling tab characters occur randomly
   within bitmap graphic output; if these are expanded to spaces, the
   output will be garbled. Auto Endcap and Enable Timeout should be
   set to No to avoid NetWare timing out the print job while it is in
   progress. The Print Banner should be disabled to avoid garbled
   printing.

   For example, if these options are set to Yes and a Windows
   application takes too long to spool a portion of a print job in
   progress, NetWare could time-out the print job in the middle. If
   you experience fragmented or garbled print jobs, make sure these
   options are set correctly. If you cannot set these options globally
   by using the PRINTCON utility, you may specify them on your CAPTURE
   command line. A sample command line is as follows:

      CAPTURE NB NA TI=0 NFF NT

   In this example, the NB is used to specify that no banner page be
   printed, the NA (No Automatic endcap) option is the same as
   setting Auto Endcap to No in PRINTCON. TI=0 (TImeout) is the same
   as setting Enable Timeout to No. NFF (No Form Feed) is the same as
   Suppress Form Feed set to Yes in PRINTCON. NT (No Tab expansion) is
   similar to setting File Contents to Byte Stream.

   If you want to make these changes for individual users rather than
   for the system as a whole, the proper CAPTURE format may be placed
   in your login script by using SYSCON.
