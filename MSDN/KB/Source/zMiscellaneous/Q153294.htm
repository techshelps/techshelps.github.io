   PowerBook using system software 7.5.3, and use RAM Doubler (version

   your PowerBook from sleep. This software fixes this problem.

   installed.
   
<LI>Improved reliability when using PC-formatted floppy disks with
   PowerBook 500 series or Duo series computers with the PowerPC Upgrade
   Card installed.
<P>
</UL>If you have a PowerBook 500 series or Duo series computer with
the PowerPC Upgrade Card installed, PC-formatted floppy disks
that were formatted on your computer may be unreadable on MS-DOS
or Windows computers.  This software fixes this problem.

<UL><LI>Improved reliability on PCI-based computers (Macintosh 7200, 7500, 7600,
   8500, and 9500 computers) and PowerBook 5300 computers, PowerBook 2300
   computers, and PowerBook 500 or Duo series computers with the PowerPC
   Upgrade Card installed.

<LI>Improved reliability when copying files to a 1 gigabyte hard disk.
<P>
</UL>If you have a PCI-based computer with a 1 gigabyte drive, this
software helps avoid problems when copying files to the hard
disk.

<UL><LI>Improved reliability when using the Startup Disk control panel.
<P>
</UL>In rare instances, when you turn on a PCI-based Power
Macintosh computer it may not start up from the disk selected
in the Startup Disk control panel.  This software fixes this
problem.

Before you Install note that if you have an AppleVision
monitor, you should install "AppleVision for System 7.5 Update
2.0 fix version 1.0" before you install this update.
<P>
When you install this software, an extension called Startup
Tuner is installed in your Extensions folder.  This extension
ensures that your computer will correctly start up from the
disk selected in the Startup Disk control panel.
<P>
It is recommended that you run the Disk First Aid application
found on the "Disk Tools" disk that shipped with your
computer. Double-click the Disk First Aid icon and follow the
instructions on the screen.  Disk First Aid checks your hard
disk for problems.  If you have a problem using Disk First
Aid, see the manual that came with your computer.
