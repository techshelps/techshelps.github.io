The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.x, 2.x, 6.x, 7.x
<LI>Word for the Macintosh, version 5.0, 5.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a document in Text With Layout or DOS Text With Layout
format, the Microsoft Word converter uses a character size of 10 pitch to
determine the maximum number of characters that can appear on a single line
in the output file. (This is independent of the font sizes in the original
Word document). To determine the number of characters per line, the
converter multiplies the number of characters per inch (cpi) by the amount
of horizontal printable space.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
If a document has an 8.5-inch page width, and left and right margins of
1.25 inch (the default setting in Word), the amount of horizontal printable
space is 6 inches. When the Word file is converted to a text file with the
Text With Layout converter, 10 cpi multiplied by 6 inches of printable
space determines that the output text file will contain a maximum of 60
characters per line. If one or more lines in the original Word document
contains more than 60 characters, the lines are truncated at the 60th
character column, and the remaining text appears on the following line.
<P>
When you convert complex document formatting to an ANSI or ASCII text file,
the converter must make several assumptions. For example, if a document
contains several pitch sizes on a single line, which size would the
converter use to determine line length? (The first font size? The largest
font size?) A text file does not allow for these variations. The default
assumption of 10 cpi in the design of this converter is the best compromise
that can be made to most consistently accommodate the generalized
conversion scenario. If this assumption does not facilitate your export
needs, make use of the PointSize or Width flags to change the assumptions
made by the converter. For information about how to do this, see the
appropriate section in the "More Information" section of this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Altering the Way Line Length Is Determined</h3>
 
<P>
The functionality of the PointSize=n and Width=n optional flags in all of
the Word products is identical.
<P>
<PRE>   The PointSize=n flag:

   This flag can be used to customize the cpi assumption used by the
   converter. By default, PointSize is set to 12. A 12-point font is
   equivalent to a 10-pitch font; thus, the converter uses a default of
   10-cpi. By changing the PointSize value to a smaller number,
   you can increase the number of characters allowed per line. For example,
   if you change PointSize to 10, the converter assumes 12 cpi. For
   example, 12 cpi multiplied by 6 inches of printable space determines
   that the converter will allow 74 characters per line.

   The Width=n flag:

   This flag is the ultimate determinant of line length. By default, it is
   set to 80-character columns, which is also the maximum number of
   characters allowed in a column. By specifying a smaller value, you can
   force lines to wrap earlier in the export text file. For example, by
   changing this setting to 50, Word will allow a maximum of 50 characters
   per line in the export file.

</PRE>The PointSize=n and Width=n optional flags can be set in the following
files for some versions of Word.

</PRE>Word for Windows version 6.x:
<P>
The settings are stored in the [TextLytConv] section of the Mstxtcnv.ini
file.
<P>
The default settings in the [TextLytConv] section are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   CharMaps=a,a Width=80 PointSize=12

</PRE>To change the Width= and PointSize= settings:

<OL><P><LI>Run the EditConversionOptions macro.
<P>
   Do this by first opening Convert.dot, which is located in the
   Macros directory in the under the Word program directory (usually

<P><LI>In the Conversion Option box, click the Width=80 option. In the
   Setting box, type the maximum number of characters that you want
   to appear on one line.

<P><LI>In the Conversion Option box select the PointSize=12 option and in
   the Setting box, type in the point size you want.
<P>
<P>
</OL>Word for Windows versions 2.x:
<P>
The settings are stored in the [TextLytConv] section of the Win.ini
file.
<P>
You view and change the options for each converter using the Options

<OL><P><LI>Run the EditConversionOptions macro.
<P>
   Do this by first opening Conversion Macros document, which is located in
   the Macros directory in the under the Word program directory.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Macro.

<P><LI>In the Macro dialog box, select the EditConversionOptions macro and

<P><LI>In the Conversion Option box select the PointSize=12 option and in
   the Setting box, type in the point size you want.
<P>
<P>
</OL>Word for the Macintosh version 5.0 and 5.1:
<P>
The same two options are available in the MS Word Conversion Options
file located in the Word Commands folder beneath the Word for the
Macintosh folder on your Macintosh system. For more information on how
to modify these settings, see the Conversion Information document
located in your Word for the Macintosh folder.
