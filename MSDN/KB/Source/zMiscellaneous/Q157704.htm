The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
- Microsoft Schedule+, version 1.0
- Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Appointments between Schedule+ 1.0 users and Schedule+ 7.0 users are
scheduled incorrectly if the time the appointment was scheduled occurs
before daylight savings time and the time of the appointment occurs after
daylight savings time.
<P>
For example, if the current date is October 15, 1996 (and daylight savings
time occurs on October 27, 1996), and you send a meeting request for
November 5, 1996, at 12:00 PM from Microsoft Mail using Schedule+ 1.0 to a
Microsoft Exchange user using Schedule+ 7.0 and the Microsoft Exchange user
accepts the request, the meeting is scheduled for 11:00 AM.
<P>
In contrast, if the current date is October 15, 1996, and you send a
meeting request for October 16, 1996, at 12:00 PM from Microsoft Mail using
Schedule+ 1.0 to a Microsoft Exchange user using Schedule+ 7.0, and the
Exchange user accepts the request, the meeting is scheduled for 12:00 PM.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the meeting request is sent by the Schedule+ 1.0
user to the Schedule+ 7.0 user, and vice versa. Schedule+ 1.0 is not aware
of time zones or daylight savings time.
<P>
NOTE: When you send a meeting request between two Schedule+ 1.0 clients
across time zones the meeting times show the time the message was scheduled
by the requester. There is no adjustment for time zone differences.
<P>
Schedule+ 7.0 is aware of time zones and daylight savings time. When you
send mail between two Schedule+ 7.0 clients (assuming each user has
properly set their time zone and clock in Schedule+), across time zones or
daylight savings time, the meetings times are correct for both clients.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
<P>
If message conversion is being handled by the client, and the customer is
using Schedule+ 7.0 and the Microsoft Mail Service Provider to get to a
Microsoft Mail Post Office, the problem can still occur.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been corrected in Microsoft Exchange Service Pack 4 (SP4).
The SP4 40-bit client for US and Canada can be downloaded from the
following location:
<P>
Internet (anonymous FTP)
<PRE>    ftp ftp.microsoft.com
    Go to the following location:

    bussys/exchange/exchange-public/fixes/Eng/Exchg4.0/SP4/

</PRE>For the US/Canada 64-Bit client, please call 1-800-370-8758 for ordering
Information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Mail and you use Schedule+ 7.0 to send a
message, the message is converted on your computer. When the recipient
receives the message, it is converted on the recipient's machine unless the
Schedule+ 7.0 properties are already in the message.
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Exchange and Schedule+ 7.0, if you send mail to
a Microsoft Mail user, the Microsoft Mail Connector Interchange (MSMI) does
the conversion.
<P>
Basically, the message content is converted at the first Microsoft Exchange
gateway (MSMI, IMC, and so forth). No process exists to override any
previous conversion, so the conversion only happens once.
