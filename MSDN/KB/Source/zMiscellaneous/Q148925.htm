<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 98
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to save your password when you are making a Dial-Up
Networking connection by clicking the Save Password check box, your
password may not be saved. This problem can occur even when you
successfully connect to the server, and when your password has not
changed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can be caused by any of the following situations:

<UL><LI>Password caching is disabled.

<LI>One or more of the files associated with Dial-Up Networking is missing
   or damaged.

<LI>Your password list (.pwl) file is damaged.

<LI>The Rna.pwl file (if it exists) is damaged.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: This problem has been known to occur after installing the Windows 95
Password List Update that is included with Microsoft Windows 95 Service
Pack 1. For more information about this update, see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q143003.htm">Q143003</A></B>
   TITLE     : Description of Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1 Updates

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Verify that password caching is enabled. To do so, examine the
   following registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\
      Policies\Network\DisablePwdCaching
</PRE><P>
   If password caching is disabled, this registry value is present with a
   value of 1.
<P>
   NOTE: You can edit the registry using System Policy Editor
   (Poledit.exe) or Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Check with your
   network administrator before you make any changes to the registry.
<P>
   System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) is available in the Admin\Apptools\
   Poledit folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. Use the Add/Remove Programs
   tool in Control Panel to install System Policy Editor.
<P>
   NOTE: System Policy Editor is not included in the floppy disk version
   of Windows 95. You can download Policy.exe, a self-extracting file
   containing Poledit.exe, from online services. Please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for information about
   downloading Policy.exe:

   If password caching is disabled on your computer, use the following
   steps to edit the registry with System Policy Editor and enable pass-
   word caching in Windows 95:

   a. Click Start, and then click Run.

   b. Type "poledit" (without quotation marks) in the Open box, and then
      click OK.

   c. On the File menu, click Open Registry, and then double-click Local
      Computer.

   d. Double-click Network to expand it, and then double-click Passwords.

   e. Click the Disable Password Caching check box to clear it, and then
      click OK.

   f. Save the changes to the registry, quit System Policy Editor, and
      then restart Windows 95.

</PRE><P><LI>Remove Dial-Up Networking, and then reinstall it. To do so, follow
   these steps:
<P>
   a. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-
<P><PRE>      click Add/Remove Programs.
</PRE><P>
   b. Click the Windows Setup tab.
<P>
   c. Click Communications, and then click Details.
<P>
   d. Click the Dial-Up Networking check box to clear it, click OK, and
<P><PRE>      then restart your computer if you are prompted to do so.
</PRE><P>
   e. Repeat steps A-C.
<P>
   f. Click the Dial-Up Networking check box to select it, and then click
<P><PRE>      OK.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Rename your .pwl file. To do so, type the following line at a command
   prompt, and then press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren c:\&lt;windows&gt;\&lt;username&gt;.pwl &lt;username&gt;.xxx
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;windows&gt; is the name of your Windows folder and &lt;username&gt; is
   the user name you use to log on to Windows 95. After renaming your .pwl
   file, restart your computer.
<P>
   When the Enter Network Password or Welcome To Windows dialog box
   appears, type the password that you normally use, and then click OK.
   When you are prompted to confirm the password that you entered, type
   the password again in the Confirm New Password box, and then click OK.
<P>
   NOTE: If there are no .pwl files present on the drive (for example,
   the user pressed the ESC key when prompted for a password as Windows 95
   starts) password caching will not be enabled. The user must first log
   on to the network in order to create a .pwl file.

<P><LI>Rename the Rna.pwl file in the Windows folder. To do so, type the
   following line at a command prompt, and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren c:\&lt;windows&gt;\rna.pwl rna.xxx
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;windows&gt; is the name of your Windows folder. After renaming the
   Rna.pwl file, restart your computer.
<P>
   NOTE: The Rna.pwl file may not exist on your computer. This file is
   not required in some configurations.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
This behavior can also occur if your computer came with Windows 95
preinstalled and is configured to automatically log on to Windows 95. To
disable automatic log on, delete the AutoLogon value from the following
registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Network\
   Real Mode Net
