<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 98
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to install the Remote Administration and Remote
Registry services on a computer running Windows 95 or Windows 98. These
services let you administer file and print sharing and edit the registry
remotely (from another computer on the network).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Both computers involved in Remote Administration must use the same level of
security (either user-level or share-level security). Remote Administration
contains three components:

<UL><LI>Net Watcher
<LI>System Monitor
<LI>File System Administration
<P>
</UL>To use System Monitor, user-level security is required and the Remote
Registry service must be enabled on the computer being remotely
administered. The Net Watcher and File System Administration tools do not
require user-level security or that the Remote Registry service be enabled.
<P>
<P><h3>Enabling the Remote Administration Service</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-
   click Network.

<P><LI>Click File And Print Sharing. Click both the "I want to be able to
   give others access to my files" and "I want to be able to allow
   others to print to my printer(s)" check boxes to select them, and
   then click OK.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Passwords.

<P><LI>On the Remote Administration tab, click the "Enable remote
   administration of this server" check box to select it.

<P><LI>Set a password for Remote Administration and then click OK.
<P>
   NOTE: If you are using user-level security, you do not receive a
   password dialog box. Instead, add users to the list by clicking Add.
<P>
</OL>WARNING: If your computer is configured to use share-level security and
the Remote Administration service is installed, a user is required to
know only a password to remotely administer your computer. To help prevent
unauthorized users from remotely administering computers, consider using
user-level security, which allows access to only specified users.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the Remote Registry Service</h3>
 
<P>
To use the Remote Registry service, you must be using user-level security
and have the Remote Administration option enabled. To install the Remote
Registry service, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>If you are already using user-level security, skip to step 5.

<P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-
   click Network.

<P><LI>On the Access Control tab, click User-Level Access Control.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Network.

<P><LI>Click Add, click Service, click Add, and then click Have Disk.

<P><LI>In the Copy Manufacturer's Files From box, type the path
   Admin\Nettools\RemoteReg folder on your Windows 95 CD-ROM, or
   Tools\Reskit\Netadmin\Remotereg on your Windows 98 CD-ROM, and
   then click OK.

<P><LI>When the Microsoft Remote Registry Service has been added to the list
   of installed components, click OK. When you are prompted to restart
   your computer, do so.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: In order to use user-level security, there must be a Microsoft
Windows NT-based computer or Novell NetWare server on the network to act as
a security provider. If you are using a Windows NT-based computer as your
security provider, you must enable File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft
Networks. If you are using a Novell NetWare server as your security
provider, you must enable File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks.
<P>
Microsoft has made updated drivers for File and Print Sharing available.
For information about obtaining the updated drivers, please see the
