</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes troubleshooting steps you can use if there is no
response from your joystick, there is no Joystick icon in Control Panel,
or Device Manager reports the following status:
<P>
<PRE>   The device is not present, not working properly, or does not have all
   its drivers installed.

   Code 10

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the GamePort Joystick is not detected by Windows 95, Device Manager
reports that the device is not present, not working properly, or does not
have all its drivers installed, or there is no response from the joystick,
perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start the computer without the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files as
   real-mode device drivers may conflict with the Windows 95 drivers and
   may disable the port.
<P>
   To start the computer without the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files,
   follow these steps
<P>
   a. Restart the computer. Press the F8 key when you see the "Starting
<P><PRE>      Windows 95" message.
</PRE><P>
   b. Select Step-By-Step Confirmation and then press ENTER.
<P>
   c. Press Y to confirm loading everything EXCEPT the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      - Process your startup device file (Config.sys)
      - Process your startup configuration file (Autoexec.bat)
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Press N so that these two lines do not load.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove the GamePort Joystick from Device Manager and then add it.
<P>
   a. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control
<P><PRE>      Panel.
</PRE><P>
   b. Double-click the System icon and then click the Device Manager
<P><PRE>      tab.
</PRE><P>
   c. Double-click Sound, Video, And Game Controllers.
<P>
   d. Check for a GamePort Joystick. If one exists, Click it and then
<P><PRE>      click Remove.
</PRE><P>
   e. Click OK.
<P>
   f. Click Close.
<P>
   To add the GamePort Joystick, or if there is no GamePort Joystick
   entry, run the Add New Hardware tool in Control Panel. If the GamePort
   Joystick device is not detected automatically, you can add it manually.
   To have the Add New Hardware Wizard detect the GamePort Joystick,
   follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then Click Control
<P><PRE>      Panel.
</PRE><P>
   b. Double-click Add New Hardware and follow the instructions on the
<P><PRE>      screen.
</PRE><P>
   If the joystick is not detected, manually add the GamePort Joystick
   driver. To manually configure Windows 95 for the GamePort Joystick,
   follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control
<P><PRE>      Panel.
</PRE><P>
   b. Double-click Add New Hardware.
<P>
   c. Click No, and then click Next.
<P>
   d. In the Hardware Types list, click Sound, Video, And Game
<P><PRE>      Controllers, and then click Next.
</PRE><P>
   e. In the Manufacturers box, click Microsoft. In the Models box, click
<P><PRE>      GamePort Joystick, and then click Next.
</PRE><P>
   f. Click Next.
<P>
   g. Click Finish.
<P>
   h. Click Yes to shut down and restart your computer.

<P><LI>Verify that the GamePort Joystick is working at the MS-DOS level. To do
   so, try to use the joystick in an MS-DOS-based program. Refer to the
   program's documentation for information about configuring the joystick.
</OL>4. Refer to the sound or game card's documentation to verify that the
<PRE>   jumpers on the card are set correctly. The game port may be disabled
   if the jumpers are set incorrectly.

   Game ports are often enabled or disabled by setting jumpers on the
   card. You may need to open the computer and verify the jumper settings
   on the card to make sure the game port is enabled. Consult the card's
   documentation for the correct settings.

   If the card is software configurable, you may be able to enable to
   disable the game port by running the card's configuration utility.
   Consult the card's documentation for additional information.

</PRE><P><LI>Verify that only one game port or game card is enabled in your computer
   at one time.
<P>
   You can verify the number of game ports that you have in your computer
   by taking note of the number of 15-pin female connectors at the
   back of your computer.
<P>
   There can be only one game port enabled in a computer at one time. Two
   or more game ports enabled in a computer conflict with each other
   because all game ports reside at the same I/O address (0201h).
   The only way you can eliminate such a conflict is to disable one of the
   game ports, usually by changing a jumper setting on one of the cards,
   or by removing the conflicting card from the computer. Consult your
   hardware documentation or manufacturer for instructions.
<P>
   Cards that typically have game ports are:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Sound cards
    - Multi-I/O cards
    - Video cards
    - Dedicated game cards
</PRE>
<P><LI>Verify that there are no devices inside the computer other than
   the game port using an I/O address of 0201h.
<P>
   Any other card in the computer using I/O address 0201h will conflict
   with the game port. To eliminate such a conflict, change the I/O
   address of the conflicting card. Card that may conflict include:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Modems
    - Scanner controller cards
    - CD-ROM controllers cards
</PRE><P>
   For information about changing a card's I/O address, please consult the
   card's documentation or manufacturer.
<P>
   To determine if there is a device inside the computer using an I/O
   address of 0201h, view the resources used in the computer with Device
   Manager, and verify the settings of the hardware devices inside the
   computer.
<P>
   To view the resources used in the computer with Device Manger, follow
   these steps:
<P>
   a. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control
<P><PRE>      Panel.
</PRE><P>
   b. Double-click System and then click the Device Manager tab.
<P>
   c. Click Computer in the device list and then click Properties.
<P>
   d. Click Input/Output (I/O) and scroll down to the 0201-0201h
<P><PRE>      setting. Take note of the device using this I/O address.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      If a device is using this setting, you must change the I/O address
      used by the device or remove the device from the computer.
</PRE><P>
   To verify the settings of devices inside your computer, you must either
   open the computer and verify the jumper settings, or run the
   configuration utility for devices that are software configurable.

<P><LI>If Windows 95 still does not detect the game port, or Device Manager
   displays an error status for the GamePort Joystick, there may be a
   problem with the hardware itself. You may need to contact the
   manufacturer of the card for assistance.
