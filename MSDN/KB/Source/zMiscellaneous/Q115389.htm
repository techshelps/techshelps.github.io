<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Product Support Knowledge Base contains articles that are
available on the Internet through an FTP service (ftp.microsoft.com). This
service includes technical support articles for the following product
categories:

<UL><LI>BUSSYS: LAN Manager, Windows NT, Microsoft Client, SQL Server, Open Data
   Base Connectivity (ODBC), and Microsoft Mail.

<LI>DESKAPPS: Desktop Applications, including Microsoft Excel, Word for
   Windows, and Office.

<LI>DEVELOPR: Development tools and languages.

<LI>PEROPSYS: Desktop Systems, including Microsoft Windows,
   Windows for Workgroups, and MS-DOS.
<P>
</UL>In addition to Knowledge Base articles, the Internet FTP server contains
the complete Microsoft Software Library for downloading. The Software
Library file tree (SOFTLIB) contains drivers, patches, Application Notes,
and other support files from Microsoft Product Support Services. In
addition to the SOFTLIB category, the following other sections are
available.

<UL><LI>MSEDCERT: Microsoft education and certification materials.

<LI>MSFT: Microsoft annual reports, sharholder information.

<LI>TECHNET: Information on TechNet.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Knowledge Base is a primary Microsoft product information
source for Microsoft support engineers and is also available to Microsoft
customers. This comprehensive database contains more than 40,000 detailed
articles with technical information about Microsoft products, fix lists,
documentation errors, and answers to commonly asked technical support
questions. These articles are also available through the Microsoft TechNet
CD-ROM, and the Microsoft Developer
Network CD-ROM.
<P>
Connection to the Microsoft Internet server requires a "live" session to
the Internet through a file transfer program (FTP) service provider.
<P>
<P><h3>Opening a Connection to the Microsoft FTP Site</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Log on to your Internet account.

<P><LI>At the Internet prompt, type
<P>
<P><PRE>      open ftp.microsoft.com
</PRE><P>
   or use the following IP address:
<P>
<P><PRE>      open 198.105.232.1
</PRE>
<P><LI>When prompted for a user name, type
<P>
<P><PRE>      anonymous
</PRE>
<P><LI>When asked for a password, type your full electronic mail address (for
   example, johndoe@test.com).
<P>
</OL><h3>Accessing a Product Group Area</h3>
 
<P>
Knowledge Base articles are located in a subdirectory below a product
directory. The product areas are located under the product group area
directories listed above. The Personal Operating System area is used as an
example in these instructions. This category is located in the PEROPSYS
directory on the FTP server. To access the PEROPSYS directory, type the
following at the FTP prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   cd /peropsys

</PRE></OL>For more details about the products found in the current tree, use the GET
command to retrieve any README.TXT files that are located in the group
areas. (The GET command is outlined below.)
<P>
Each group area contains subdirectories for each product contained in the
group area. Under the PEROPSYS directory, the following subdirectories are
available:
<P>
<PRE>   WINDOWS -  Microsoft Windows and Windows for Workgroups
   MSDOS -  Microsoft MS-DOS
   HARDWARE -  Microsoft Mouse and other hardware

</PRE>Use the CD command from the FTP prompt to select the subdirectory you are
interested in. Each product subdirectory contains a KB subdirectory in
which the actual Knowledge Base articles are stored.
<P>
Log on to the KB subdirectory with the CD command (type "cd kb" [without
the quotation marks]). Once you are in the KB directory, download the
README.TXT and INDEX.TXT files located in that directory. README.TXT
contains important information regarding Knowledge Base articles on the
Internet FTP server. INDEX.TXT contains a list of article titles and
article IDs for each article. You must determine the article ID before you
can download the article. (There is no search mechanism other than
downloading and searching the INDEX.TXT file.)
<P>
To download these files, type the following at the FTP prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   get readme.txt
   get index.txt

</PRE>Once you review README.TXT and determine the article ID that you are
interested in, you are ready to download a Knowledge Base article.
<P>
The Knowledge Base articles are stored in a tree structure, with each
article ID translated into a two-digit filename and stored two
subdirectories under the KB directory. This method avoids storing thousands
of articles in one subdirectory, which would slow server performance.
<P>
You do not need to change to the directory that contains the Knowledge Base
article you want to download. The directory structure is consistent and the
GET command can be used to obtain an article from the KB directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Download (GET) a Knowledge Base Article</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps outline how to obtain an article after logging on to
the FTP server. This example includes downloading an actual article
contained in the WIN3X area. The sample article ID to download is <B><A HREF="../WIN3X/Q91679.htm">Q91679</A></B>,
"Terminal: Sending Incoming Text Data to a Text File."

<OL><P><LI>After logging on to the FTP server, change to the PEROPSYS directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd /peropsys
</PRE>
<P><LI>Change to the WINDOWS directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd WINDOWS
</PRE>
<P><LI>Change to the KB directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd kb
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: These three steps can be substituted with "cd/peropsys/windows/kb"
   (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Translate the article ID into a GET command. There are three parts of
   the article ID to be divided before using the GET command. Reading the
   article ID backwards, translate using this formula (article ID <B><A HREF="../WIN3X/Q91679.htm">Q91679</A></B> is
   used as an example):
<P>
   The filename is the last two digits plus the .TXT extension (79.TXT).
   The subarea is the first digit to the left of the filename (6). The
   primary area is the remaining characters to the left, including the "Q".
   To use the GET command, place a forward slash (/) between the filename,
   subarea, and primary area (primary/sub/filename).
<P>
   If the article ID is six digits (including the "Q"), the article ID
   translates to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B><A HREF="../WIN3X/Q91679.htm">Q91679</A></B> = Q91/6/79.TXT
</PRE><P>
   If the article ID is seven digits, it translates to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B><A HREF="../zzMiscellaneous/Q107409.htm">Q107409</A></B> = Q107/4/09.TXT
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use the GET command at the FTP prompt to transfer the article to your
   system as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      get Q91/6/79.TXT <B><A HREF="../WIN3X/Q91679.htm">Q91679</A></B>.TXT
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      get Q107/4/09.TXT <B><A HREF="../zzMiscellaneous/Q107409.htm">Q107409</A></B>.TXT
</PRE><P>
   The "<B><A HREF="../WIN3X/Q91679.htm">Q91679</A></B>.TXT" part of the above example is the destination name for
   the file. The destination name is the name of the file as it appears on
   your hard disk drive.

<P><LI>To close the connection with the server for most FTP clients, type the
   following from the FTP prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      bye
</PRE><P>
</OL>If you receive an "access denied" error during any transfers, you do not
have write access in the current working directory on your client system.
Contact the system administrator for assistance if you receive this error.
