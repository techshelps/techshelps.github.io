</PRE><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
 
<P>
The WV1160 disk included with this Application Note contains an
updated run-time version of Microsoft Video for Windows. Video 1.1e
for Windows retains all the improvements that were included in version
1.1d of Video for Windows, but does not include the low-level driver
code that was licensed from Intel Corporation.
<P>
<P><h3>SPECIFIC FILES UPDATED IN VERSION 1.1E</h3>
 
<P>
The following files are changed in version 1.1e:
<P>
<PRE>   Filename     Description
   --------------------------------------------------------------

   DCISVGA.DRV  This file is removed if it is found in your
                Windows\SYSTEM subdirectory.
   MSVIDEO.DLL  This file contains support for additional display
                adapters.

</PRE><h3>PREVIOUS IMPROVEMENTS TO VIDEO FOR WINDOWS</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Improved palette support. The new version of MSVIDEO.DLL and the
   Cinepak and Indeo codecs prevent Video for Windows from having to
   dither 24-bit videos twice during playback.

<LI>Display Control Interface (DCI) support. DCI allows Video for
   Windows to provide faster and smoother playback on video adapters
   that use the S3, Cirrus Logic, or any one of several other chip
   sets. Video for Windows now supports all DCI-enabled video
   adapters. The performance of stretched and clipped videos is also
   much improved for all video adapters.

<LI>Better overall performance.

<LI>Improved simultaneous playback of two .AVI files.

<LI>Improved playback of loosely interleaved or noninterleaved files
   with NetWare(R) Video.

<LI>Improved performance of video playback, correcting a problem that
   caused shaky playback.

<LI>The compression algorithm was changed to meet the official
   Interactive Multimedia Association adaptive-differential-pulse-code-
   modulation (ADPCM) format specification fully.

<LI>A general protection (GP) fault problem was corrected. This problem
   occurred when you clicked embedded Video 1.1 for Windows media
   objects in OLE 2.0 clients.

<LI>A slight memory leak that occurred with embedded objects was
   corrected.
<P>
