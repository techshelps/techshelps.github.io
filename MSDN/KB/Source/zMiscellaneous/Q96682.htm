Summary:
<P>
It is sometimes important for a program on the network to send urgent
data from the sending station to receiving station, thereby avoiding
any buffering. The out-of-band data bit (sometimes referred to as
urgent data bit) and push bit in the TCP header is used for this
purpose. Microsoft TCP/IP supports sending urgent data by setting the
push bit. Microsoft TCP/IP does not support receiving out-of-band data
or data with the push bit set. The packets received with the
out-of-band data bit or the push bit set will be treated the same as
other packets.
<P>
<P><h3>Out-of-Band Data</h3>
 
<P>
Out-of-band data is generated (TCP header with the urgent bit set)
when the data must be specified as urgent and the TCP stack on the
receiver must notify the receiving process of the arrival of the data
immediately. TCP allows the sender to specify data as being
out-of-band by setting the OOB bit in the TCP header and the urgent
pointer field. The urgent pointer field specifies the position in the
receive window where urgent data ends.
<P>
The Microsoft TCP/IP stack does not set the OOB data bit; instead, the
push bit is used for data needing immediate delivery. Microsoft TCP/IP
does not support the processing of out-of-band data as a receiver. The
out-of-band data received by Microsoft TCP/IP stack is not treated as
urgent data and it is buffered as usual.
<P>
<P><h3>Push Bit</h3>
 
<P>
The push bit setting specifies to the TCP stack that the data should
be sent out on the network immediately. The normal buffering of data
on the sender is avoided and the transport stack immediately processes
the data and sends it with the push bit marked in the TCP header. The
push bit indicates that the data should be sent to the receiver
immediately. When the receiver receives the data, it should also
notify the receiving process of the arrival of the data immediately,
thus not buffering the data on the receiving end.
<P>
The Microsoft TCP/IP implementation supports the use of push bit as a
sender. Using the Microsoft TCP/IP Sockets Development Kit, the push
bit on a packet can be set by using the MSG_PUSH flag on the send() or
sendto() function calls. Microsoft TCP/IP does not treat incoming
packets with the push bit turned on as urgent data. Instead, the data
is buffered as usual.
<P>
Reference(s):
<P>
For more information on out-of-band data bit and push bit, please
refer to "Internetworking with TCP/IP", Vol. I &amp; II by Douglas Comer,
and Microsoft TCP/IP Sockets Development Kit documentation and RFC
793, 1122.
