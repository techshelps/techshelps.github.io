The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to install the Supplemental WordPerfect
Conversions Kit on a network so that users can set up the converters to use
on their workstations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Network installation is a two-part process. First, the Network
Administrator performs an Administrative Setup, then each user at a
workstation performs a Workstation Setup.
<P>
<P><h3>Part 1: Administrative Setup</h3>
 
<P>
If users on the network are running shared Windows from the server, the
person performing the Network install must be running the same shared
Windows, and must have all directory privileges to the shared Windows
directory.

<OL><P><LI>If you are installing the Conversion Kit from a floppy disk, insert the
   disk in the appropriate floppy disk drive.
<P>
   If you downloaded WPCNV.EXE from an online service, you'll need to
   expand the files so they can be installed. Make sure the WPCNV.EXE file
   has been placed in a new directory before expanding the files it
   contains.
<P>
   IMPORTANT: Don't expand the files into the Word directory, as the Setup
   program will fail when run.
<P>
   To expand the files contained in the WPCNV.EXE file so that you can
   proceed to the next step:
<P>
   a. In File Manager, locate WPCNV.EXE and double-click the filename.
<P>
   b. Choose OK.

<P><LI>In File Manager, click Run on the File menu.

<P><LI>Type "&lt;source&gt;:\setup /A" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER,
   where "&lt;source&gt;" is the directory containing the extracted contents of
   WPCNV.EXE, or if the kit was ordered on disk, the drive letter where the
   disk was inserted.
<P>
   For example, type
<P>
<P><PRE>       c:\download\setup /A
</PRE><P>
   -or-
<P>
<P><PRE>       a:\setup /A
</PRE>
<P><LI>Specify the destination directory for the setup files. The default
   directory is WPKIT at the root level of the server.

<P><LI>Specify the shared files directory. This directory is where the kit's
   shared components are stored, and is typically the MSAPPS directory on
   the server.

<P><LI>Choose the location where shared files will be accessed by users who do
   subsequent Workstation installations from the server. The choices are:
   Server, Local Hard Drive, and User's Choice.
<P>
   The WordPerfect Kit Administrative Setup File Organization section below
   illustrates where the files are placed on the server.
<P>
</OL><h3>Part 2: Workstation Setup</h3>
 
<P>
Each user at a Workstation will then need to run SETUP.EXE from the network
server location. Each user performing a Workstation install must specify
his or her own Word directory as the destination directory when prompted by
Setup. The user's Word directory can reside on the local workstation, or on
the server.

<OL><P><LI>Exit Microsoft Word if it is running.

<P><LI>In Program Manager, click Run on the File menu.

<P><LI>Type "&lt;source&gt;:\setup" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER,
   where "&lt;source&gt;" is the path to the directory located on the server as
   specified by the Network Administrator in Step 4 in the Administrative
   Setup. (The default directory is WPKIT located at the root level.)

<P><LI>At the screen where the user is prompted to choose the desired type of
   installation (Complete, Custom, or Workstation), the user must specify
   the user's Word directory.
<P>
   NOTE: The shared Word directory on the server may appear as the default
   destination directory in the dialog screen. However, the shared Word
   directory must only be selected during the Administrative Setup of the
   kit.

<P><LI>Specify where shared files will be installed. The user has the choice
   of installing shared items to the local &lt;Windows&gt;\MSAPPS directory or
   the shared items directory on the server.
<P>
</OL>The WordPerfect Kit Workstation Setup File Organization section below
illustrates where the files are placed.

 * These items can be stored on the server if the user so specifies. The
   user will be able to specify where the starred items are stored if the
   Network Administrator chooses "User's Choice" in step 7 of
   Administrative Installation.

 + In a shared Windows environment, these items will be stored in the user
   Windows directory either on the server or on the local drive. Note that
   under shared Windows, a &lt;Windows&gt;\SYSTEM subdirectory does not exist.
   All files that would typically be installed in the &lt;Windows&gt;\SYSTEM
   subdirectory of a local install of Windows would be installed in the
   Windows directory.
