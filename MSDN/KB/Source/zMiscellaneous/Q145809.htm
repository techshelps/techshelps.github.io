<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the Sysbckup folder and how it works in Windows 95
and Windows 98.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Background Information</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 3.1 includes several new features, such as common dialog boxes,
that are not available in Windows 3.0. These new features are provided by
dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are either new for Windows 3.1 or are
upgrades of existing libraries included with Windows 3.0.
<P>
A program written to take advantage of these new Windows 3.1 features does
not run under Windows 3.0 because the required features are not available.
To solve this problem, permission was granted to software vendors to
install or upgrade the affected libraries as part of their program
installation procedures.
<P>
<P><h3>The Effect Under Windows 95 and Windows 98</h3>
 
<P>
Many programs designed for Windows 3.1 install the Windows 3.1 versions of
certain system files in order to ensure that the Windows 3.1 features are
available. The standard Windows file installation library compares the
existing library with the library the program intends to install and
chooses the more recent version.
<P>
However, some programs do not use the standard Windows file installation
library. Instead of comparing the files, some programs simply overwrite the
existing library with the version included with the program, replacing the
Windows 95 or Windows 98 version of the library with the Windows 3.1
version.
<P>
<P><h3>How Windows 95 and Windows 98 Solve the Library Conflict Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 and Windows 98 keep a small database of libraries most commonly
Overwritten by installation programs. When an installation program exits,
Windows checks that the files in this database were not improperly
overwritten. If Windows detects that a file was improperly replaced, it
restores the file from the hidden Windows\Sysbckup folder. This is done
automatically, with no user intervention required.
<P>
There is also a database of less commonly replaced files. If Windows 
detects that one of the files in the secondary database has been replaced,
it displays a dialog box listing the name of the overwritten file and
recommend that you run Windows Setup again. Windows Setup restores the
original files.
