<P>
Word 7.0 supports conversion to and from a number of foreign file formats,
including word processor, spreadsheet, and database files. Word interprets
some foreign formats internally and others through use of external
converter files or ODBC drivers. A list of available converters and the
formats they support is included below.
<P>
For more information on converter registration and file locations and on
which converters are installed with each of Word's Typical, Compact, and
Custom Setup options, please see the following articles in the Microsoft

<LI>To obtain conversion support for file formats not directly supported by
   Word, do the following:
<P>
   1. Consult the documentation included with your application to
<P><PRE>      determine which file formats, if any, it can save as. Compare this
      list with the list of file formats Word can import and use the
      interim format that provides the best formatting retention.
</PRE><P>
   2. To locate third-party converter vendors and conversion bureaus that
<P><PRE>      can assist you with document conversion, query in the Microsoft
      Knowledge Base on the following words:
