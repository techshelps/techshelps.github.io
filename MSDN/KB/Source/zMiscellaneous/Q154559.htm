</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0, Microsoft has adhered to the
Java security specification set forth by Sun Microsystems which dictates
that Java programs run in what is known as a "sandbox." A "sandbox" is an
area in memory outside of which the program cannot make calls. This
prevents Java programs from being able to call low-level system functions
that could cause data corruption or other damage.
<P>
Microsoft also includes code-signing detection in Internet Explorer that
notifies the user whether the Java program was created by a trusted
publisher and shows a warning message if the publisher is not trusted or
if the program is not signed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Code signing (as implemented with Authenticode) and the Java sandbox
approach are two methods used to provide security in Internet Explorer.
<P>
Microsoft has the most secure sandbox available today in Internet Explorer
3.0, and will continue to add capabilities to it. However, as published
reports in the last six months have shown, sandboxing by itself is
inadequate to offer a satisfactory level of security. It is also unlikely
that sandboxing will ever be able to offer a rich enough set of
capabilities for many programs. For that reason, Microsoft offers
Authenticode as an additional level of security. Authenticode provides
users with accountability, because it positively identifies the publisher
of a piece of code.
<P>
These two security methods augment each other. Some programs run fine
within the robust sandbox provided in Internet Explorer, but signed code
can be run with a higher degree of assurance, whether inside the sandbox
or out. Users want their browsers to support both capabilities, and that
is why Microsoft is including both in Internet Explorer.
<P>
Code signing is also an industry-wide initiative. Netscape and JavaSoft
have publicly announced their intention to support it, and the World Wide
Web Consortium is currently discussing a Microsoft code-signing
submission.
