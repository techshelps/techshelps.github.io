The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0, 6.0.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes exchanging documents between Microsoft Word 6.0
for the Macintosh and Microsoft Word 6.0 for Windows. Because both Word 6.0
for Windows and Word 6.0 for the Macintosh share the same file format, no
conversion is necessary in order to exchange documents across platforms.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>To Use a Word 6.0 for Windows Document in Word 6.0 for the Macintosh</h3>
 
<P>
Save the document as you normally would, transfer the document to
the Macintosh platform, using Apple File Exchange, DOS Mounter or MAC-PC
Exchange, and open it in Word 6.0 for the Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h3>To Use a Word 6.0 for the Macintosh Document in Word 6.0 for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
Save the document as you normally would, transfer the document to
the Windows platform, and open it in Word 6.0 for Windows.
<P>
NOTE: A converter named "Word 6.0 for Windows&amp;Macintosh" is installed with
Word 6.0 for the Macintosh. However, this converter has no relevance to
exchanging documents between the 6.0 versions of Word. It is only provided
to enable Word 5.x for the Macintosh users to open Word 6.0 documents.

</PRE>Also, an erroneous "Word for the Macintosh 6.0" file type option may appear
in the Word 6.0 for Windows Save As dialog box. This option should not be
used. As stated earlier, you need only save your Word document using the
default "Word Document" option.

   TITLE     : WD6X: Invalid "Word for Macintosh 6.0" File Type in WinWord
               6.0

</PRE><h3>Core Code Features</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 for Windows and Word 6.0 for the Macintosh are "core code"
programs. A core code programs shares a very high percentage of
programming code in cross-platform versions, resulting in a nearly
identical version of the product on each platform.
<P>
A key benefit of core code is the ability to easily share information and
files across platforms without the need for file conversions. This is
explained below in more detail.
<P>
Common Feature Set:
<P>
One benefit of having Word share a nearly identical code base is that
cross-platform versions of Word also share a virtually identical feature
set.
<P>
This has a large impact on file transfer, because having an identical
feature set is a requirement to share files cleanly across platforms. With
earlier versions of Word, this was one of the largest problems, because
each version of Word had slightly different feature sets or different
implementations of similar features.
<P>
Common File Format:
<P>
Because Word 6.0 shares the same feature set across platforms, it is
possible to store data using a consistent file format. Earlier versions of
Word converted cross-platform documents through an intermediate format that
resulted in slower file exchange and the occasional loss of formatting.
<P>
Common Layout Engine:
<P>
Having the same feature set and storing information in the same format is
vital to effective cross-platform conversion. However, each version of Word
must use the exact same logic for laying out text and graphics on a page.
Word 6.0 shares an identical layout engine, which greatly reduces
pagination differences in documents transferred across platforms.
<P>
Using core code to achieve identical features, file formats, and layout
engines, Microsoft Word 6.0 maximizes cross-platform compatibility.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 6.0 Recognizes Cross-platform Issues</h3>
 
<P>
There are still differences between Microsoft Windows and the Macintosh
that result in minor differences in the appearance of documents shared
across platforms. These occur as a result of differences inherent in the
operating systems.
<P>
Word 6.0 includes special features to minimize or eliminate platform
differences, ensuring unsurpassed cross-platform file compatibility. Below
is a brief explanation of the obstacles to perfect cross-platform
conversions and a description of how Word 6.0 addresses these issues.
<P>
<P><h3>Font Differences</h3>
 
<P>
Despite their similar appearance, the standard Macintosh TrueType fonts
(Times, Helvetica, and Courier) are actually quite different from the
standard fonts in Microsoft Windows (Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier
New). These fonts come from the same font families, but the actual font
metrics of the font sets are different. Even very short documents using
these fonts on their respective platforms exhibit noticeable changes in
pagination, and the effect on long documents is unmistakable. Therefore,
it's very important that programs address this issue aggressively.
<P>
Bundled TrueType Fonts:
<P>
Word 6.0 for the Macintosh includes a subset of Microsoft's
TrueType Master Set for the Macintosh including Arial, Courier New,
Times New Roman, and Wingdings: the same TrueType fonts that ship
with Microsoft Windows. This guarantees a consistent base set of
fonts for every Word user, so that most documents do not face any
font mapping difficulties.
<P>
User Definable Font Mapping:
<P>
However, in the event that there are fonts that are simply not available
cross-platform, Word also provides a friendly interface to allow users to
easily map missing document fonts into fonts available on their systems.
The user can choose to perform a permanent font conversion or to just
choose a new temporary mapping, leaving the original font information
intact in the Word file. This is especially useful for files that are
continually exchanged "round-trip" between platforms.
<P>
<P><h3>Graphic Primitives: GDI &amp; QuickDraw</h3>
 
<P>
Every operating system relies upon its own set of graphic "primitives" to
manage all screen and printer interaction. A primitive is an instruction
for the operating system to draw an object in a certain way. Under Windows
the standard collection of primitives is called Graphics Device Interface
(GDI) while the Macintosh uses a standard called QuickDraw. Each graphic
primitive also has a corresponding "native" graphic file format that is
used for storage and display on its respective platform. For QuickDraw this
format is known as PICT, while the GDI format is the Windows Metafile
(WMF).
<P>
At a conceptual level, GDI and QuickDraw serve identical purposes, but
their implementations are subtly different. For example, GDI uses a round
"pen" for all of its drawing, whereas QuickDraw uses a square pen. GDI
supports dashed lines while QuickDraw does not. QuickDraw supports rotated
text while GDI does not. The end result of these and many other subtle
incompatibilities is that it's impossible to convert every graphic between
GDI and QuickDraw without obtaining slightly different results. The
implications of this are discussed in detail below.
<P>
Using Native Picture Formats:
<P>
To maximize the potential of each platform, application programs
typically depend upon the native graphic formats of that platform for
graphic storage and display. So, Word for Windows represents all
graphics as WMF images, while Word for the Macintosh relies
substantially on PICT images. This is vital for performance reasons, and
it also facilitates the use of operating system features such as Publish
&amp; Subscribe and OLE.
<P>
Therefore, to share documents between cross-platform versions of Word 6.0,
all of the graphic images must somehow be converted between PICT and WMF.
Fortunately, this conversion occurs automatically when Word 6.0 opens a
document containing cross-platform pictures. For example, when Word 6.0 for
the Macintosh opens a Word 6.0 for Windows document containing a WMF, it
converts the WMF "on the fly" to an equivalent PICT to be displayed by Word
for the Macintosh. This conversion takes place "silently" without troubling
the user.
<P>
Word Picture Storage: "Simple" Pictures vs. OLE Pictures:
<P>
To fully understand what happens from here, you need to know a bit more
about the way Word stores pictures internally. Pictures can take two
forms in Word. The first is a "simple" picture (referred to hereafter
without quotation marks) which contains a single representation of the
image. Most pictures in Word are stored this way. In Word for
Windows these simple pictures are stored as WMFs. In Word for the
Macintosh, for compatibility and performance reasons, these pictures are
stored as WMF placeholders followed immediately by a PICT representation
of the image.
<P>
Note that Word version 6.0c for Windows is necessary to fully convert
these images. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q116258.htm">Q116258</A></B>
   TITLE     : WD6X: "Use Word 6.0c or Later to View Macintosh Picture."

</PRE>The second form of a picture in Word is an OLE picture. OLE pictures
generally only appear in Word when you choose Insert Object, Paste
Special, or when you double-click a simple picture to edit it using
the drawing tools in Word. While OLE pictures tend to be larger and slower
than simple pictures, they can cleanly store multiple representations of
an image. This makes them a potentially valuable tool for continued
cross-platform document exchange.
<P>
Simple Picture Handling:
<P>
Word retains cross-platform document fidelity by only converting simple
pictures temporarily for display purposes in cross-platform exchanges.
Therefore, if a user of Word 6.0 for Windows creates a document that
includes several simple pictures, a user of Word 6.0 for the Macintosh
can view and edit document text without permanently affecting the
enclosed pictures. Word does this by only storing the converted image in
memory. Word only permanently converts a picture when the user double-
clicks to edit that particular image, thereby transforming it into an
OLE picture. This is discussed in further detail below.
<P>
OLE Picture Handling &amp; Cross Platform Caching:
<P>
Unlike simple Word pictures, Word 6.0 OLE pictures are capable of
retaining more than one representation of an object. Therefore, Word
stores both WMF and PICT versions of an OLE picture in cross-platform
exchanges. For users concerned more with file size than cross-platform
fidelity, Word does have the option to toggle this behavior. To disable
caching, from Word's Tools menu choose Options, select the Save tab, and
select the Save Native Picture Formats Only option. This ensures that
Word doesn't store non-native versions of a picture when it saves a file
with OLE pictures.
<P>
To understand this caching and why you might want to use it, step
through the following example. When a Word for Windows document
containing an OLE picture (with WMF representations) is opened by Word
for the Macintosh, the WMF is automatically converted to a PICT
version of the same image. This PICT is then used for all display and
printing while the document is in use on the Macintosh, but the original
WMF is also stored in the OLE object. When this document is again opened
by Word for Windows, the original, unconverted WMF is used for display
and printing, and the PICT image is cached for future use on the
Macintosh. If a picture is edited, cached versions are deleted because
they are obsolete.
<P>
Printer Driver Differences:
<P>
One issue that Word 6.0 cannot address completely relates to differences
in the printer drivers on the Macintosh and Windows Platforms. Even with
core code and all of its other cross-platform enhancements, when Word
for Windows and Word for the Macintosh print to the same printer, the
documents have different line and page breaks. While this may seem
unusual, consider that when using any word processor, printing the same
document to different printers leads to different results. This is
because the word processor depends upon device metrics supplied by
different printer drivers. The same fundamental concepts affect cross-
platform printing.
<P>
Word depends on the platform graphic primitives and the printer
driver to send information to the printer. So, even with identical
cross-platform versions of Word and using the same exact printer,
different printer drivers and graphic primitives are involved on
each platform.
