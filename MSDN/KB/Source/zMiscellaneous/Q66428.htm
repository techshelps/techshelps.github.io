<PRE>                   HOW TO LINK Basic PDS 7.1 WITH
                 C 5.1, FORTRAN 5.0, OR PASCAL 4.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
This article describes how to link Basic Professional
Development System (PDS) version 7.1 with C 5.1, FORTRAN 5.0, or
Pascal 4.0.
<P>
This information applies only to Microsoft Basic PDS version
7.1, Microsoft C Compiler version 5.1, Microsoft FORTRAN Compiler
version 5.0, and Microsoft Pascal Compiler version 4.0 for MS-DOS.
<P>
Basic programs compiled with Microsoft Basic PDS 7.1 use the Microsoft
C version 6.0 and QuickC 2.50 format for start-up code and memory
allocation. This format has changed so dramatically between C 5.1 and
C 6.0 that Basic PDS 7.1 is not directly compatible with C 5.1,
FORTRAN 5.0, or Pascal 4.0 (which use the C 5.1 format for start-up
code and memory allocation).
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: Microsoft Basic PDS 7.1 is compatible with Microsoft C PDS
   6.0. Basic PDS 7.0 is compatible with C 5.1, but Basic PDS 7.1 is
   not directly compatible with C 5.1 unless you use the method
   described in this application note.

</PRE>To make Basic PDS 7.1 compatible with C 5.1, FORTRAN 5.0, or Pascal 4.0,
you must alter the FORTRAN or Pascal language libraries and incorporate
modules from the C 6.0 run-time libraries, as explained further below.
<P>
The files you downloaded from the MSL include the following two C 6.0 run-
time libraries (which were built by running the C 6.0 SETUP.EXE program and
choosing no GRAPHICS.LIB and no PGCHART.LIB included in the combined
libraries):
<P>
<PRE>   LLIBCER.LIB and LLIBCAR.LIB

</PRE>These provided files support only the large memory model, the emulation and
alternate math packages, and the MS-DOS (or real mode under OS/2) operating
system.
<P>
<P><h3>Pascal 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
To make Basic PDS 7.1 compatible with Pascal 4.0, perform the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Make a copy of the Pascal run-time library that you want to make
   compatible with Basic PDS 7.1. (You must keep a separate copy of
   the original unmodified Pascal run-time library so you can continue
   to link Pascal 4.0 programs when not using mixed-language calls.)

<P><LI>Remove the following modules from the Pascal 4.0 run-time library:
   CRT0, FMALLOC, AMALLOC, NMALLOC, and PNMSIZE.
<P>
   An example of removing these modules from the LIBPASE.LIB library
   using the LIB.EXE utility is as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      LIB LIBPASE.LIB -CRT0 -FMALLOC -AMALLOC -NMALLOC -PNMSIZE;
</PRE><P>
   Name your new Pascal library Newmixed.LIB (where Newmixed is the
   filename you assign); it is now a Pascal run-time library that has
   all of the conflicting code removed.

<P><LI>Remember that this application note provides large memory model
   support libraries (LLIBCER.LIB and LLIBCAR.LIB) from C 6.0; thus,
   you must design your Pascal program to follow the conventions of
   programming in a large memory model.

<P><LI>Please read the "Linking Your Compiled Programs" section further
   below.
<P>
</OL><h3>FORTRAN 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
To make Basic PDS 7.1 compatible with FORTRAN 5.0, perform the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure you have built the FORTRAN 5.0 library to be run-time
   compatible with C.

<P><LI>Make a copy of the FORTRAN run-time library you want to modify for
   Basic PDS 7.1 compatibility. (You must keep a separate copy of the
   original unmodified FORTRAN run-time library so you can continue to
   link FORTRAN 5.0 programs when not using mixed-language calls.)

<P><LI>Remove the CHKSTK module from the copy of the FORTRAN run-time
   library. An example of removing CHKSTK from FORTRAN's LLIBFER.LIB
   library using the LIB.EXE utility is as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      LIB LLIBFER.LIB -CHKSTK;
</PRE><P>
   Name the new FORTRAN library Newmixed.LIB. Once the CHKSTK module
   has been removed, you should have a FORTRAN run-time library that
   has all of the conflicting code removed.

<P><LI>Remember that this application note provides large memory model
   support libraries from C 6.0; thus, you must design your FORTRAN
   program to follow the conventions of programming in a large memory
   model.

<P><LI>Please read the "Linking Your Compiled Programs" section below.
<P>
</OL><h3>Linking Your Compiled Programs</h3>
 
<P>
Once you have modified the Pascal or FORTRAN library (Newmixed.LIB as
described above) and you have compiled your Pascal or FORTRAN source
file(s), you must link your object modules with the proper libraries
in the proper order. In the LINK command line, you must specify the
Basic library first, the C 6.0 library LLIBCER.LIB or LLIBCAR.LIB
(included with this application note) second, and your new Pascal or
FORTRAN library (Newmixed.LIB) last. You also must link with the /NOD
and /NOE options to ensure that the default libraries the object files
normally use are ignored and only the libraries you explicitly list
are used. The following is an example
<P>
<PRE>   LINK /NOD/NOE Bas1.OBJ + Mixed.OBJ, Bas1.EXE,,BRT71ENR.LIB +
                 LLIBCER.LIB + Newmixed.LIB;

</PRE></OL>where Bas1.OBJ is your Basic main program, and Mixed.OBJ is your
Pascal or FORTRAN object module.
<P>
<P><h3>C 5.1</h3>
 
<P>
To make Basic PDS 7.1 compatible with C 5.1, you must use a method
different from the method used above for Pascal or FORTRAN.
<P>
Because the Basic PDS 7.1 and C 5.1 libraries aren't designed to be
compatible, there isn't an easy way to make the two libraries work
together. In this case, you must use the provided C 6.0 run-time
libraries, which provide support for emulator (/FPi) (LLIBCER.LIB) and
support for alternate math (/FPa) (LLIBCAR.LIB) support for MS-DOS.
<P>
The following are examples of the required Basic 7.1 and C 5.1
compiling and linking steps
<P>
<PRE>   BC /FPi /O Btest.BAS;
   CL /c /AL /FPi Ctest.C
   LINK /NOD /NOE Btest + Ctest,,,BCL71ENR.LIB LLIBCER.LIB;

</PRE>where the LLIBCER.LIB file above is one of the two C 6.0 libraries
(LLIBCER.LIB or LLIBCAR.LIB) provided with this application note.
(Don't use the C 5.1 run-time library of the same name.)
<P>
<P><h3>Final Note on Compatibility</h3>
 
<P>
Although the above methods have been designed to produce compatible
results, we have not put them through a standard Microsoft mixed-
language testing cycle, and it is possible that you may still
encounter compatibility problems under certain conditions. We cannot
guarantee the complete success of mixed-language programming of Basic
7.1 with C 5.1, FORTRAN 5.0, or Pascal 4.0. Further problems or
questions can be directed to Microsoft Language Support Services.
