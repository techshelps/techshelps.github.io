<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information and commonly asked questions about
virtual memory in Microsoft Windows 95.
<P>
Windows 95 uses a dynamic virtual memory manager to handle swap file
duties. You should use the default virtual memory settings whenever
possible. However, if you have limited hard disk space you may want to
set some of the virtual memory settings manually.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In order to provide more memory to applications than is physically present
in the computer in the form of RAM, Windows 95 uses hard disk space to
simulate RAM. The amount of RAM in the computer plus the size of the paging
file (also known as the swap file) equals the total physical memory, or
virtual memory, size. Windows 95 uses a dynamic paging file that remains at
a size of 0K until it is needed. The paging file can grow to use all the
available space on the hard disk if it is necessary. This is the default
setting for the paging file. You should use this setting if possible.
<P>
If you have limited hard disk space, other applications may reduce the
amount of virtual memory below that needed by Windows 95 and its
applications. If this occurs, choose the "Let me specify my own virtual
memory settings" option button on the Performance tab of the My Computer
property sheet. You can use this option to set a minimum and maximum size
for the paging file.
<P>
You can also choose to use no virtual memory. You should use this option
only if there is enough RAM to meet all the needs of Windows 95 and the
applications you run.
<P>
NOTE: The Disable Virtual Memory option is unavailable on computers with
8 MB of RAM or less.
<P>
<P><h2>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. In Microsoft Windows version 3.x, a temporary swap file is slower
<P><PRE>       than a permanent swap file. Will letting Windows 95 set my virtual
       memory slow down my computer?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. No. The temporary swap file in Windows 3.x has to switch between
       real mode and protected mode, slowing down the computer. As Windows
       95 runs only in protected mode, the swap file is as fast or faster
       than the permanent swap file in Windows 3.x.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. I compressed my hard disk with DriveSpace. Can I still select my
<P><PRE>       own virtual memory settings? In Windows 3.x I cannot use a
       permanent swap file on a compressed drive.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. If your compressed drive is supported by a protected-mode driver,
       it is better to use the compressed drive for the paging file. If
       the compressed drive is not supported by a protected-mode driver
       then you must place the paging file on the host drive.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. How can I determine whether my compressed drive is supported by a
<P><PRE>       protected-mode driver?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. At this time there are protected-mode drivers only for DoubleSpace
       and DriveSpace compressed drives. You can also check the IOS.INI
       file (if it exists) in the Windows directory to see which drives
       require real-mode support.
