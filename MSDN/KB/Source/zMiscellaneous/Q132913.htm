</UL><h3>Where to Get the Extract Utility</h3>
 
<P>
The Extract utility is located on Disk 1 of each of the disk sets listed
above, except for Works 4.0 for Windows 95. Copy the file Extract.exe from
Disk 1 to your computer and place it in a directory on your path. To
extract files from the CAB files on the Works 4.0 disks, use the copy of
Extract.exe in your &lt;Windows 95&gt;\Command directory.
<P>
In order to make best use of space, certain large files are spread among
the disks.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Interrupt the Extract Program</h3>
 
<P>
You can cancel a running Extract program by pressing CTRL+C.
<P>
<P><h3>Copying an Entire CAB File</h3>
 
<P>
The syntax of this command is
<P>
<PRE>   extract /c &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;cabinetname&gt; &lt;destination&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter, &lt;cabinetname&gt; is the name of the cabinet
file you want to copy, and &lt;destination&gt; is the full path and filename of
where you want the cabinet file to end up.
<P>
This command is necessary when you are copying an entire cabinet file from
floppy disks to a hard drive or network drive. If the cabinet file is
already on the hard drive or network drive, you can copy files to any hard
drive or network drive with a simple COPY command. The Extract utility is
necessary only when you are copying the file from floppy disks, because the
floppy disks are formatted in a new way, and require a special utility to
read them.
<P>
For example, to copy a cabinet file named EXCEL2.CAB from drive A to the
directory C:\DISK2, use the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   extract /c a:\excel2.cab c:\disk2\excel2.cab

</PRE><h3>Extracting All Files from a CAB File</h3>
 
<P>
The syntax of this command is
<P>
<PRE>   extract /e /a /l &lt;destination&gt; &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;cabinetname&gt;

</PRE>The /E switch extracts all files on the specified cabinet(s).
<P>
The /A switch extracts all files on all disks, beginning with the first
cabinet specified. You can specify any cabinet file, and Extract will
search that cabinet file and all files that come after it. Be sure to place
the disk specified in the command line in the drive before executing this
command.
<P>
The /L switch lists the locations of the files. First the destination of
the files expanded files is given, followed by a space and the source of
the cabinet files. If you omit this switch, Extract expands files into the
current directory.
<P>
For example, to copy all of the files from all cabinets on all disks to the
directory C:\FLAT, use the following command (and place disk 1 in drive
A:):
<P>
<PRE>   extract /e /a /l c:\flat a:\excel1.cab

</PRE>To copy all of the files from the EXCEL4.CAB cabinet to the current
directory, use the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   extract /e a:\excel4.cab

</PRE>To copy all of the files from the WORD5.CAB file to the directory C:\DISK5,
use the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   extract /e /l c:\disk5 a:\word5.cab

</PRE>To copy all of the files from Word disks 5 through 7 to the directory
C:\DISKS, use the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   extract /e /a /l c:\disks a:\word5.cab

</PRE><h3>Displaying All Files in a Particular CAB File</h3>
 
<P>
The syntax of this command is
<P>
<PRE>   extract /d &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;cabinetname&gt;

</PRE>For example, to list all the files in EXCEL2.CAB, use the following
command:
<P>
<PRE>   extract /d a:\excel2.cab

</PRE><h3>Locating a Particular File in a Particular CAB File</h3>
 
<P>
The syntax of this command is
<P>
<PRE>   extract /d &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;cabinetname&gt; &lt;filename&gt;

</PRE>For example, to see if ODBC.DLL is located in the WORD7.CAB file, use the
following command:
<P>
<PRE>   extract /d a:\word7.cab odbc.dll

</PRE>For example, to list all *.DLL files in the WORD7.CAB file, use the
following command:
<P>
<PRE>   extract /d a:\word7.cab *.dll

</PRE><h3>Locating a Particular File in an Unknown CAB File</h3>
 
<P>
The syntax of this command is
<P>
<PRE>   extract /a &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;firstcabinetname&gt; /d &lt;filename&gt;

</PRE>For example, to find the file SOLVER.XLA when you don't know which cabinet
it's in, use the following command to look on all disks, starting with Disk
1 (be sure to place Disk 1 in the drive before you start):
<P>
<PRE>   extract /a a:\excel1.cab /d solver.xla

</PRE>As Extract views the contents of each disk, it displays the name of the
cabinet file on the screen. When it finds the filename you are looking for,
it displays the file information on the screen.
<P>
NOTE: Extract will continue to search the remaining disks to see if there
is a duplicate filename. You must watch the screen carefully to see when
the file information is displayed, and note the cabinet name that was
displayed above it--this is the cabinet you are looking for.
<P>
HINT: If the cabinet files are all stored on a network drive or a hard
drive, the cabinet names may scroll off the screen before you can read
them. Redirect the Extract output to a file, and scroll through the file
using Notepad or another text editor.
<P>
NOTE: This method is not suitable for use with disks, as you receive no
prompting that Extract is waiting for the next disk.
<P>
<PRE>   Redirecting results to a text file
   ----------------------------------

   1. Type the command above, adding a greater-than symbol (&gt;) and a text
      filename:

        EXTRACT /A A:\EXCEL1.CAB /D SOLVER.XLA &gt; LIST.TXT

   2. Press ENTER.

   3. The command-line prompt appears and a new file has been created in
      the current directory. The file LIST.TXT can be opened and read with
      any text editor.

</PRE><h3>Extracting a single file from a particular CAB file</h3>
 
<P>
The syntax of this command is
<P>
<PRE>   extract &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;cabinetname&gt; filename /l  &lt;destination&gt;

</PRE>For example, to extract the file CALENDAR.WIZ and copy it to the
C:\WINWORD\TEMPLATE directory, use the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   extract a:\word6.cab calendar.wiz /l c:\winword\template

</PRE><h3>Extracting a Single File from an Unknown CAB File</h3>
 
<P>
The syntax of this command is
<P>
<PRE>   Extract /A &lt;Drive&gt;:\&lt;Cabinetname&gt; &lt;Filename&gt; /L &lt;Destination&gt;

</PRE>Extract searches all the cabinet files in sequential order and then
extracts the file once it is found.
<P>
For example, to extract the MSSPEL2.DLL file from disks in drive A into the
WINDOWS\MSAPPS\PROOF directory on drive C, use the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   extract /a a:\word1.cab msspel2.dll /l c:\windows\msapps\proof

</PRE>Extract will look at every cabinet file, beginning with the first cabinet
file you specified. When Extract finds the file, it extracts it, and
continues looking through the rest of the disks.
<P>
<P><h3>Extracting Certain Types of Files from a Particular CAB File</h3>
 
<P>
The syntax of this command is
<P>
<PRE>   extract &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;cabinetname&gt; &lt;filetype&gt; &lt;destination&gt;

</PRE>For example, to extract all the *.DLL files on Word's Disk 7, use the
following command:
<P>
<PRE>   EXTRACT A:\WORD7.CAB *.DLL D:\WINWORD

</PRE><h3>Syntax of the EXTRACT Utility</h3>
 
<P>
To obtain a complete list of command options for the EXTRACT, insert Disk 1
and switch to the drive containing the disk. For example, type "A:" without
the quotation marks if the disk is in drive A. Then type EXTRACT or EXTRACT
/? at the command prompt to obtain a list of commands for EXTRACT. You will
see the list below:
<P>
EXTRACT [/Y] [/A] [/D | /E] [/L dir] cabinet [filename ...]
EXTRACT [/Y] source [newname]
EXTRACT [/Y] /C source destination
<P>
<PRE>  cabinet  - Cabinet file (contains two or more files).
  filename - Name of the file to extract from the cabinet. Wild cards and
             multiple filenames (separated by blanks) may be used.

  source   - Compressed file (a cabinet with only one file).
  newname  - New filename to give the extracted file. If not supplied, the
             original name is used.

  /A         Process ALL cabinets.  Follows cabinet chain starting in first
             cabinet mentioned.
  /C         Copy source file to destination (to copy from DMF disks).
  /D         Display cabinet directory (use with filename to avoid
             extract).
  /E         Extract (use instead of *.* to extract all files).
  /L dir     Location to place extracted files (default is current
             directory).
  /Y         Do not prompt before overwriting an existing file.
