<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses differences between the various editions of
Bookshelf 1995.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows, 1995 Edition</h3>
 
<P>
The original edition of Bookshelf 1995 is the 16-bit version.
<P>
<P><h3>Bookshelf 95 for Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
This updated CD-ROM is a dual-platform disc. It includes the 16-bit
and 32-bit versions. This CD replaces the 16-bit only version and is
labeled:
<P>
<PRE>   Bookshelf 95 for Windows 95

</PRE>Microsoft Works version 4.0 for Windows 95 &amp; Bookshelf 95
 
<P>
On this disc, Bookshelf 95 is the 32-bit version only.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office for Windows 95 Professional Edition with Bookshelf</h3>
 
<P>
Office 95 Professional With Bookshelf has two discs marked "Disc 1"
and "Disc 2". Bookshelf is integrated into Disk 2.
<P>
NOTE: Early packages of Office 95 Professional With Bookshelf bundled
the Office 95 CD-ROM with the Bookshelf 95 CD-ROM. This Office disc
is marked Office Standard. The Bookshelf CD-ROM is exactly the same
as the standard Bookshelf 95 dual-platform disc.
<P>
NOTE: No content changes occur with the various editions of
Bookshelf 95. Only code changes, which are discussed below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
New Features in the 32-bit version:

<UL><LI>Supports Windows 95 features such as Autorun, long filenames,
   common dialog boxes, and more.

<LI>32-bit Setup, Program and Help files. This provides improved
   performance, especially for sound and video playback.

<LI>Option to run from the CD-ROM drive does not require any hard disk
   space. The 16-bit version of Bookshelf must use the hard drive.

<LI>Basic integration with all Office 95 programs and Works 4.0. Both
   applications have a Lookup Reference located on the Tools menu. This
   works through OLE automation and the Windows 95 Registry. This
   mechanism also supports other new reference titles, such as Encarta
   Encyclopedia for Windows, 1996 edition.

<LI>Special integration with Microsoft Excel 7.0 using a Microsoft Excel
   Visual Basic for Applications macro. Microsoft Excel has a Define
   shortcut context menu accessed using the right mouse button. Bookshelf
   has a Copy to Excel option provided by OLE automation.
<P>
</UL><h3>32-bit Setup</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Setup.exe installs the 32-bit version if the system is running:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows 95
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51
</PRE>
<LI>Setup.exe installs the 16-bit version if the system is running:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Windows, version 3.x
    - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.x
    - Microsoft Windows NT, versions 3.1 or 3.5
</PRE>
<LI>The Works 95 &amp; Bookshelf Setup.exe is a smart menu program, with an
   option to run Bookshelf if the application is already installed. If
   the program is not installed, the options are to run Works Setup or
   Bookshelf 32-bit Setup.

<LI>Office 95 Professional With Bookshelf has one integrated Setup
   program.

<LI>Network setup of Bookshelf is not implemented using the Setup
   program. Customers who purchase a network license for Bookshelf
   receive the Bookshelf 95 Network Administrators guide. For
   information on Office Professional network setup as it relates to
   Bookshelf, please refer to the file Network.txt on Office Disc 1.
<P>
</UL><h3>Updated 32-bit QuickShelf</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The 32-bit QuickShelf contains a Shortcut Bar mode. To use the
   Shortcut Bar mode, drag the QuickShelf icon to any edge of the
   desktop to activate the screen-width mode. To return to the
   floating toolbar mode, drag the object away from the edges of the
   desktop.

<LI>The Office 95 Shortcut Bar and QuickShelf can be combined into one
   Shortcut Bar. For more information on the Shortcut Bar, see your
   Readme.txt file for details.
<P>
   NOTE: Microsoft Office Professional on CD-ROM already has QuickShelf
   and the Office Shortcut Bar combined. You will not see a separate
   QuickShelf toolbar.

<LI>The program includes the new Autohide option, a feature similar to the
   Windows 95 taskbar Autohide feature.

<LI>The Customize button has been removed. To customize, with your right
   mouse button click the Title bar or click the Control menu. This
   activates Customize, Help, and other special options.

<LI>There isn't a Small Buttons option. Instead, you have a Large Buttons
   feature that you can activate. The Off setting is similar to Medium
   Buttons. The new Autofit option is similar to Small buttons, if Large
   Buttons is turned off.

<LI>QuickShelf Keys, the keyboard shortcuts for QuickShelf, are no
   longer available.
<P>
</UL><h3>Integration with Microsoft Works for Windows</h3>
 

<UL><LI>16-bit Bookshelf integrates with the Multimedia Editions of Works,
   versions 2.x or 3.x.

<LI>32-bit Bookshelf integrates with Works 4.0 for Windows 95. As with
   Office 95, Works has a Reference Lookup item on the Tools
   menu. This works in conjunction with the Registry to launch the
   Reference Title, and contains various search options. A special
   feature is in Works is the Reference toolbar button.
<P>
</UL><h3>Word Integration</h3>
 

<UL><LI>16-bit Bookshelf integrates with Word 6.x (16-bit) only. 32-bit
   Bookshelf integrates with Word 7.0.

<LI>No integration is possible with Word 6.x and 32-bit Bookshelf 95.
   QuickShelf can be used to provide reference lookup features manually.

<LI>In addition to the basic integration to Office 95 programs, special
   integration is provided to Word 7.0 through the functions of a 32-
   bit .wll file.

<LI>Bookshelf Daily and Define are no longer on the View menu as in
   Word 6.x. Word 7.0 has a Define shortcut context menu accessed
   by clicking the right mouse button.

<LI>Bookshelf Daily is not part of the Word 7.0 integration.

<LI>Bookshelf has a Copy to Word option. This is provided by OLE
   automation with Word 7.0, and through Bsctw.exe with Word 6.x.

<LI>NOTE: Word 8.0 (which comes with Office 97) does not support the
   Define option on the contextual menu with Bookshelf 95. Upgrade to
   Bookshelf 1996-97 or Bookshelf 98 in order to get this functionality.
