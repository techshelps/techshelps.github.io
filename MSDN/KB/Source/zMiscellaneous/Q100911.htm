The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22
</UL> 
<P>
This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for
commands and filenames.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you copy or create files on a DoubleSpace-compressed drive, it is
possible to receive an "Insufficient Disk Space" error message when
MS-DOS reports sufficient space to perform the operation. This article
discusses potential causes of this problem and workarounds.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are several instances, including those listed below, in which
MS-DOS may report insufficient disk space when copying files to a
compressed drive.

<UL><LI>The estimated compression ratio (ECR) is lower than the actual
   compression ratio (ACR) for the files to be copied. In this case,
   MS-DOS underestimates the space available. To correct this problem,
   set the ECR equal to the ACR for the drive as follows:
<P>
   1. Start DoubleSpace by typing "dblspace" (without the quotation
<P><PRE>      marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt.
</PRE><P>
   2. Select the compressed drive you want to change and then choose the
<P><PRE>      Change Ratio command from the Drive menu.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The Change Compression Ratio dialog box appears.
</PRE><P>
   3. The default ratio is the ACR. Choose OK.
<P>
   You can also change the ECR from the MS-DOS command prompt. For more
   information, type "help dblspace /ratio" (without the quotation marks)
   at the MS-DOS command prompt.
<P>
   NOTE: The above procedure causes MS-DOS to estimate free disk space
   more accurately and may also increase the number of FAT entries
   available. If the files to be copied are highly compressible, then you
   may need to make the ECR higher than the current ACR.

<LI>The ECR is higher than the ACR for the files to be copied. In this
   case, MS-DOS overestimates the space available, and you must either
   delete files or enlarge the drive to free space. To enlarge the
   compressed drive, use the following steps:
<P>
   1. Start DoubleSpace by typing "dblspace" (without the quotation
<P><PRE>      marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt.
</PRE><P>
   2. Select the compressed drive you want to enlarge, then choose the
<P><PRE>      Change Size command from the Drive menu.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The Change Size dialog box appears. The New Free Space line shows
      how much free space the compressed and uncompressed drives will
      have if you choose OK.
</PRE><P>
   3. Specify a smaller number for New Free Space on the uncompressed
<P><PRE>      drive. As you change this number, DoubleSpace adjusts the New Free
      Space amount for the compressed drive. When the New Free Space amount
      for both drives is what you want, choose OK.
</PRE><P>
   DoubleSpace enlarges the compressed drive.
<P>
   NOTE: The above procedure decreases the free space on the uncompressed
   (host) drive.

<LI>The DoubleSpace drive is too fragmented. To correct this problem,
   use the commands DBLSPACE /DEFRAG /F and DBLSPACE /DEFRAG on the
   compressed drive as follows:
<P>
   NOTE: You may want to perform this procedure overnight. Defragmenting
   a large or badly fragmented drive can take a long time. (To defragment
   overnight, put both commands into a batch file.)
<P>
   1. Make the compressed drive your current drive.
<P>
   2. Type "dblspace /defrag /f" (without the quotation marks) at the
<P><PRE>      MS-DOS command prompt.
</PRE><P>
   DoubleSpace defragments the drive.
<P>
   3. When DoubleSpace finishes, type "dblspace /defrag" (without the
<P><PRE>      quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt.
</PRE><P>
   DoubleSpace consolidates free space on the drive to leave as much
   free space as possible.

<LI>No more FAT entries are available. To correct this problem, split
   the host drive into more compressed drives as follows:
<P>
</UL>If the data on a compressed drive is reaching the 512-megabyte limit,
reduce the size of the drive and then use the Create New command on
the Compress menu to create a new drive from free space on the drive.

<UL><LI>Finally, certain programs or files may cause the "Insufficient Disk
   Space" message or may fail when they are installed on a DoubleSpace-
   compressed drive because their ACR is close to 1:1. These include
   the following:
<P>
   - Many games by Sierra On-Line (also marketed as Dynamix or Coktel)
<P>
   - Microsoft Mail Format (.MMF) files
<P>
   - Encrypted data files
<P>
   - Precompressed files (such as .ARC, .ZIP, .PCX, and .GIF files)
<P>
</UL>Move highly compressible files to the compressed drives and leave
files that compress poorly on uncompressed drives.
<P>

DoubleSpace-compressed drive, see page 125 in the "User's Guide."
