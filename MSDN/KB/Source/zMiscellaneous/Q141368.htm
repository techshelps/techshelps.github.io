The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 98
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a program that accesses a CD-ROM drive, you may notice that
the program is not performing optimally. You may notice slow data transfer
in a business or reference program, or skipping or slow audio and video in
a multimedia program.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Supplemental Cache Size and Optimize Access Pattern For settings may
not be set correctly for your CD-ROM drive.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Try the following steps to improve the CD-ROM drive's performance:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click System.

<P><LI>On the Performance tab, click File System.

<P><LI>Click the CD-ROM tab.

<P><LI>Move the Supplemental Cache Size slider to the right to allocate more
   RAM for caching data from the CD-ROM drive or to the left to allocate
   less RAM for caching data.
<P>
   Note that many multimedia programs perform better with a smaller cache
   because these program tend not to reuse data.

<P><LI>For reading continuous data, such as .avi files, use a higher setting
   in the Optimize Access Pattern For box. For reading random data,
   increase the Supplemental Cache Size setting and decrease the Optimize
   Access Pattern For setting.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then click Close. When you are prompted to restart your
   computer, do so.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you are using real-mode drivers for your CD-ROM drive, these
settings have no effect.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The supplemental cache is used to hold path table, directory, and file
information. It is a passive cache holding data that has been accessed
and may be accessed again.
<P>
The Optimize Access Pattern For setting is based on a 64K cache (single-
speed read ahead plus 14K random access cache). This is incremented in 50K
increments depending on the CD-ROM drive speed. It is an active buffer
storing data initially read from the CD-ROM.
<P>
The default cache size is not based on the CD-ROM drive, but on the amount
of RAM in the computer, as follows:

<UL><LI>For computers with less than 8 MB of RAM, the default setting is
   single-speed read ahead cache (50K) + small random access cache (14K).

<LI>For computers with from 8 to 12 MB of RAM, the default setting is
   double-speed read ahead cache (100K) + medium random access cache
   (512K).

<LI>For computers with more than 12 MB of RAM, the default setting is
   quad-speed read ahead cache (200K) + large random access cache
   (1024K).
