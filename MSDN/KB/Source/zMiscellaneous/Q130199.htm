<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides information about limitations when converting from
WordPerfect 6.0 for DOS, and WordPerfect 6.0 and 6.1 for Windows to the
versions of Word listed at the beginning of this article. Features that are
converted completely are not listed. Only features that are not converted
or require some comment are listed.
<P>
Below is a list of Word properties and features and comments about how
those features are converted from WordPerfect 6.x documents by the
WordPerfect 6.x import converter supplied with the Microsoft Supplemental
WordPerfect Conversions Kit for Word for Windows.
<P>
NOTE: The WordPerfect 6.0 converters are shipped with Word for Windows,
versions 7.0 and 7.0a, but the fonts, templates, and documentation for
WordPerfect conversions are not shipped. When the WordPerfect 6.0 Converter
Kit is installed in Word 7.0, the following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>     Setup has detected that Word 6.0 is not installed. The WordPerfect
     text converters will only work with Word 6.0 for Windows. To not
     install the text converters, choose the Custom Install button on the
     next dialog box and uncheck the Text Converters option.

</PRE>Installing the WordPerfect 6.0 Converter Kit with Word for Windows 95,
versions 7.0 and 7.0a will allow for the addition of the WordPerfect
templates, fonts, and documentation.

                                    respectively. The conversion adjusts
                                    the margins as needed to preserve page
                                    layout. If you experience problems
                                    with margins (for example, if they are
                                    set outside the printable range in
                                    Word), choose Page Setup from the File

                                    choose OK. If margins need to be
                                    adjusted, Word will ask to fix them.

  Merge codes        No             Merge constructs and macros are lost

                                    page layout view and print preview,
                                    and when printing. Drawing layer
                                    objects will not appear in normal
                                    view. Graphics boxes that are
                                    anchored to a page or a paragraph,
                                    have wrap-around text, and are
                                    located in tables, parallel columns,
                                    or headers/footers are converted to
                                    boxes with wrap-through in Word. In

                                    drawing layer objects in Word.

                                    All graphics lines are converted as
