Bookshelf '95. The Troubleshooting section in Help covers a variety of
topics such as improving performance and resolving audio difficulties.
<P>
<P><h2>REMOVING BOOKSHELF '94</h2>
 
<P>
Bookshelf '95 Setup does not automatically remove Bookshelf '94 from
your computer. To remove Bookshelf '94, re-run Setup for Bookshelf '94
and choose "Remove All." (This removes only the Bookshelf-specific
files. Shared files, such as DLL's and DRV's, installed in the Windows
System directory are not removed.)
<P>
You may also need to do the following:

<UL><LI> If you have moved the Bookshelf '94 and/or QuickShelf icon into a
   different Program Group since installing the application, Setup
   will not be able to detect the new location of the icon and delete
   it from Program Manager. After running Remove All from Setup,
   delete the icon(s) from Program Manager.

<LI>The BOOKS94 directory (or whatever directory was identified as the
   destination directory during setup) will not be removed. If this
   directory is not being used for other files, use File Manager or
   the Explorer to delete the directory.
<P>
</UL><h2>GENERAL USAGE NOTES</h2>
 

<UL><LI>When copying 256-color images, be aware that unless you copy to a
   program that can handle 256 colors, such images will appear in
   16 colors.

<LI>Pictures copied from Bookshelf using the Copy to Word command will
   include the caption, but pictures copied using the Copy Picture
   command will not.

<LI>The Pronunciation Key pop up included in the Bookshelf Dictionary
   can be copied to the Clipboard by pressing CTRL+C.

<LI>Under Windows 95, it is important to not remove the Bookshelf '95
   disc immediately after inserting it. Please wait for the Microsoft

<P><h3>Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16/16ASP</h3>
 
<P>
Compressed audio clips may fail to play if you are using a Sound
Blaster 16 or Sound Blaster 16 ASP sound card. For example, you may
not be able to play any sounds in the Dictionary, but animations in
the Encyclopedia may play correctly. This problem occurs because some
computers are unable to use the 16-bit DMA (direct memory access)
channel on the Sound Blaster cards.
<P>
To correct this problem, switch the HDMA channel to use DMA or 8-bit
DMA. You must change this setting in the following two places:

<OL><P><LI>The Drivers dialog box in the Windows Control Panel.

<P><LI>The SBCONFIG.EXE configuration program included with the Sound
   Blaster cards.
<P>
</OL>To change the settings, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Choose the Drivers icon in the Windows Control Panel.

<P><LI>Select the Sound Blaster 16 Wave/Midi driver and choose Setup.

<P><LI>Exit Windows.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, switch to the SB16 directory and run
   SBCONFIG.EXE.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions provided by this configuration program.
   It assists you in selecting and testing the following variables:
<P>
<PRE>   Variable            Select
   ========           ========

   Base I/O port      Autoscan
   MidiPort address   Autoscan
   DMA interrupt      Current
   8-bit DMA          Current
   16-bit DMA         Use 8-bit DMA

<P><h2>BOOKSHELF '95 DISPLAY</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Bookshelf '95 requires a 256-color display to run. If your
computer's display is less than 256 colors, you need to install a 256
color driver, or obtain one from your video card's manufacturer.
<P>
A set of generic 256 color drivers (which support most non-accelerated
Super VGA adapters) has been included on the Microsoft Bookshelf '95
disc (see the README.TXT supplied with the drivers for more
information on supported video adapters). The file (SVGA.EXE) is
located in the D:\AAMSSTP\VIDEO directory (assuming D:\ is the drive
letter of your CD-ROM).
<P>
Note: Video adapters based on the S3 chip set will not work with the
generic 256 color driver (SVGA.EXE). In this case you will find
specific S3 drivers (also located in the D:\AAMSSTP\VIDEO directory)
for these video adapters. The driver you select depends on the
specific S3 chip set your video adapter uses. For more information on
the version of the S3 chip set your video card uses, see the user's
manual included with your video card. Once you have determined the
version of the S3 chip set your video card supports, use the following
table to determine which file to copy to your hard disk.
<P>
<PRE>   Chip set     Copy file
   =======      =========

   801/805      S3-801.EXE
   924          S3-924.EXE
   928          S3-928.EXE

</PRE>To install the driver, you will first need to copy the appropriate
driver file from the D:\AAMSSTP\VIDEO directory on the Microsoft
Bookshelf '95 CD to your hard disk (Note: do not copy this file to the
C:\WINDOWS or C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directories).
<P>
Once the file has been copied to the hard disk you will need to
"extract" the video driver by either typing the name of the file and
pressing the Enter key from the MS-DOS prompt (i.e., SVGA &lt;Enter&gt;) or
by double-clicking on the file (SVGA.EXE) in the File Manager.
<P>
Once the files are extracted, complete the installation of the video
driver by opening the DISPLAY.TXT file located in the directory where
the expanded video driver resides. Find the section entitled
"Installing a Display Driver" and follow the steps.
<P>
For further information on installing a different display driver,
choose Contents from the Help menu in the Windows Setup application or
consult your Windows documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Display Problems</h3>
 
<P>
In some situations, Bookshelf '95 may encounter video display problems
when using high-resolution video drivers from various video card
manufacturers. The problems include:

<UL><LI>Images and illustrations appearing grainy or having "glitches."

<LI>Videos displaying garbled images or causing General Protection
   Faults.
<P>
</UL>Most problems can be fixed by obtaining new drivers from your video
card manufacturer. Contact the manufacturer of your video card to
determine if there are newer versions available. Their phone number
should be in the manuals that came with your video card or personal
computer. Another option for obtaining updated drivers is the
Microsoft Download Service, an electronic bulletin board that can be
accessed via a modem at (206) 936-MSDL (6735).
<P>
<P><h3>Font Display Problems</h3>
 
<P>
Bookshelf '95 uses TrueType fonts for its display. If you receive  a
message stating that one of the fonts is unavailable, make sure that
TrueType fonts are enabled on your computer.

<OL><P><LI>From the Windows Control Panel, select Fonts and then click
   the TrueType button.

<P><LI>In the TrueType dialog box, make sure the Enable TrueType Fonts
   check box is selected (an X appears in the check box when it is
   selected).

<P><LI>If the Enable TrueType Fonts check box is selected, then go back
   to the Fonts dialog box and click the Help button for more
   information on adding fonts.
<P>
</OL>To view fonts currently installed in Windows, open the Control Panel.
&gt;From the Control Panel, select Fonts. Fonts currently in use by
Windows are listed in the Installed fonts box.
<P>
Bookshelf '95 uses and installs the following TrueType fonts:

<UL><LI>Arial (TrueType)
<LI>Arial Bold (TrueType)
<LI>Arial Bold Italic (TrueType)
<LI>Arial Italic (TrueType)
<LI>Bookshelf Symbol 1 (TrueType)
<LI>Bookshelf Symbol 2 (TrueType)
<LI>Bookshelf Symbol 3 (TrueType)
<LI>Symbol (TrueType)
<P>
</UL>If any of the above are missing, run the Bookshelf '95 Setup program
and choose Remove All. Once Setup is complete re-run the Bookshelf '95
Setup program to reinstall Bookshelf '95.
<P>

QuickShelf is configured to work with the Office Shortcut Bar provided
in Microsoft Office for Windows 95. You can also combine the
functionality for QuickShelf and Office Shortcut Bar into one bar.

   the upper-left corner of QuickShelf and choosing Exit.

<P><LI>Right-click on any blank area on the Office Shortcut Bar and choose

<P><h2>NOTES ON QUICKSHELF IN WINDOWS 3.1 and WINDOWS FOR WORKGROUPS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>QuickShelf Keys and MS-DOS Use</h3>
 
<P>
QuickShelf keys allow you to look up selected text in Bookshelf from
any Windows application. However, you cannot bring up Bookshelf using
QuickShelf keys from an MS-DOS application or from the MS-DOS prompt.
Additionally, selected text in an MS-DOS application will not be used
to perform a QuickShelf lookup when using the QuickShelf buttons.
Other Windows applications that do not copy text in the standard way
also may not work with QuickShelf.
<P>
QuickShelf and the Clipboard
 
<P>
Clicking a QuickShelf button or using a QuickShelf key combination
replaces the contents of the Clipboard.
<P>
Moving the QuickShelf Toolbar
 
<P>
Open the QuickShelf Customize menu by either right-clicking on the
Toolbar or by left-clicking the down arrow button at the right end of
the Toolbar, and then clicking Customize.  Click the Customize View
Tab, and then select either Regular buttons or Large buttons, and
click OK. QuickShelf now has a title bar you can click in and then
drag to a new location.
<P>
<P><h3>QuickShelf and the Automatic Spelling Feature</h3>
 
<P>
Searches performed with QuickShelf are not spell checked. In this
case, keep Bookshelf open on your desktop as an icon; this way you
will have quick access to it.
<P>
<P><h3>QuickShelf and Bookshelf '94</h3>
 
<P>
If you choose to keep Bookshelf '94 installed on your computer, you
may find that trying to launch Bookshelf '95 from QuickShelf will
result in Bookshelf '94 being started. To correct the problem, close
Bookshelf '94 and launch Bookshelf '95 from the Program Manager. The
next time QuickShelf is used, Bookshelf '95 will start.
<P>
<P><h2>NOTES ON ADDRESS BUILDER</h2>
 
<P>
In some instances the Address Builder may be unable to suggest a ZIP
code based on a street address alone. In this case, try using a city
name (spell it correctly) and/or a state name to narrow down ZIP code
information.
<P>
<P><h2>NOTES ON THE SPELLING FEATURE</h2>
 

<UL><LI>The Automatic Spelling feature is unable to check multiple words.

<LI> The Automatic Spelling feature functions in three places in
   Bookshelf: the Contents Tab, Find Tab, and Advanced Find dialog.
   When the Spelling dialog box comes up from the Contents Tab, it
   uses a custom dictionary that has only Table of Contents items.
   When the Spelling dialog box comes up from either the Find Tab or
   Advanced Find dialog, it uses the standard spelling dictionary.
<P>
</UL><h2>RUNNING ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT</h2>
 
<P>
The following are known issues related to using Bookshelf with Windows
NT. Where possible, solutions or work-arounds are provided.

<P><h3>QuickShelf Find on Windows NT 3.5</h3>
 
<P>
When your machine is running Windows NT 3.5, you can experience
problems when you select a word in 32-bit applications and use
QuickShelf to perform a full-text search on the word in Bookshelf.
Bookshelf will appear, but the search will not be performed because
QuickShelf cannot move the text out of the application running in NT.
<P>
Keep Bookshelf open on your desktop as an icon, so you have easy
access to it from other applications when you want to do a full-text
search on a word.
<P>
<P><h3>QuickShelf Keys and Windows NT 3.5</h3>
 
<P>
When your machine is running Windows NT 3.5, you can experience
problems when you use QuickShelf key combinations in 32-bit
applications because QuickShelf cannot move text out of these NT
applications.
<P>
In this case, keep Bookshelf open on your desktop as an icon; this way
you will have quick access to it.
