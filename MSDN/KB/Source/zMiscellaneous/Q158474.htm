<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 98
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article documents the Windows 95 registry entries for the TCP/IP
protocol. For more information about Windows 95 TCP/IP settings, see
the Win95rk.hlp file in the Admin\Reskit\Helpfile folder on the Windows
95 CD-ROM.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee
that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing
Keys And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note
that you should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and
User.dat) before you edit the registry.
<P>
The Value entries described in this article do not normally exist in the
Windows 95 registry; they must be added to the following registry key:

agent. The default is 0.
<P>
EnableRouting = 0 or 1

query. The minimum is 100. The default is 750.
<P>
NameTableSize = integer
<P>
Data Type: DWORD

255.
<P>
SingleResponse = 0 or 1
<P>
Data Type: DWORD
<P>
For a computer with multiple network adapters, specifies whether to send
all IP addresses on a name query request from WINS. If this value is 1,
the system will send one address in a name query response; if 0, it will
return all the addresses of its adapters. The default is 0.
<P>

This section describes variables for subkeys that appear in the
following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\MSTCP\
   ServiceProvider

</PRE>The following keys describe the order used to resolve host names. A
lower number sets a higher priority for name resolution. These settings
are used for 16-bit Windows Sockets, which need to rely on the resolvers
that are expected to take the least time. The numbers indicate the
default values specified in Windows 95.
<P>
LocalPriority = 499
HostsPriority = 500
DNSPriority = 2000
NetbtPriority = 2001
<P>
For additional information about this functionality, please see the
following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q170619.htm">Q170619</A></B>
   TITLE     : Windows 95 ServiceProvider Priority Values Not Applied

</PRE>The entries in this section must be added to the following registry key,
where n represents the particular TCP/IP-to-network adapter binding.
<P>
<PRE>   Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\netTrans\
   000n

</PRE>MaxMTU = 16-bit integer
<P>
Data Type: String
<P>
Specifies the maximum size datagram IP that can pass to a media driver.
SNAP and source routing headers (if used on the media) are not included
in this value. For example, on an Ethernet network, MaxMTU will default
to 1500. The actual value used will be the minimum of the value
specified with this parameter and the size reported by the media driver.
The default is the size reported by the media driver.
