Microsoft Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade Release Notes

<OL><P><LI>Windows95 Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade
<P>
</OL>The Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking 1.2 upgrade is a significant 
enhancement to the Dial-Up Networking features that were originally 
delivered with Windows95.  This upgrade provides client support for a 
single PPTP connection, support for internal ISDN adapters, multilink 
capabilities, connection-time scripting to automate non-standard logins, 
and improved performance and stability.  All of the improvements 
included in the OSR2 release of Windows95 and the ISDN1.1 Accelerator 
Pack have been included in this package.
<P>
The Windows95 Dial-Up Networking 1.2 upgrade replaces all of the Dial Up 
Networking components, and installs new versions of the TCP/IP stack and 
<PRE>the NDIS layer.   A new version of Winsock is included as an optional 
</PRE></OL>component in order to correct name resolution limitations in the 
original Windows95 software. 
<P>
This Dial-Up Networking 1.2 upgrade can be applied to existing Window95 
systems, including the retail release and OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2).  
This package cannot be used to upgrade a Memphis Developer's Release or 
future Memphis beta releases.  (Note that the features provided by this 
Dial-Up Networking Upgrade are already present in the Memphis 
Developer's Release.)
<P>
1.1  Installation Notes
<P>
To install the upgrade, simply execute the MSDUN12.exe file and follow 
the instructions.  The installation process will require you to reboot 
the machine, and may ask for your Windows95 installation disk (if you 
originally  installed Windows95 from a CD.)  If you encounter a "do you 
want to keep a newer file" dialog, always keep the newer file.  After 
the boot, you will see a DHCP error message asking if you wish to see 
future DHCP error messages.  (Select "yes".)
<P>
Beta users can install the Dial-Up Networking 1.2 upgrade over a 
previous beta version of the upgrade without removing the previous 
version.
<P>
Once the installation is complete, you will be able to remove the Dial-
Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade by using the install/uninstall tab of the 
<PRE>"Add/Remove Programs" icon in the setup folder.   This will remove all 
</PRE>of Dial-Up Networking from your system.  After this, you can add the 
original Windows95 version of Dial-Up Networking by using the windows 
setup tab of the "Add/Remove Programs" icon.  Alternately, you can re-
install the 1.2 upgrade by executing the MSDUN12.exe file.
<P>
Note that an uninstall of the Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade will 
completely remove Dial-Up Networking from your system, including any 
features that depend on it.  For example, an uninstall would remove 
Direct Cable Connection and Virtual Private Networking in addition to 
the ability to dial out over modems or ISDN devices.  If you have 
installed an ISDN device, removing Dial-Up Networking will logically 
remove the device and any information that you entered for it.  This 
information will not be restored when you re-install Dial-Up Networking.
<P>
Always use the "Add/Remove Programs" icon in the setup folder in order 
<PRE>to add or delete Dial-Up Networking from your system.   Do not add or 
</PRE>remove individual Dial-Up Adapter or Virtual Private Networking Adapter 
components via the Network Control Panel applet or from the Device 
Manager tab of the System applet.

<OL><P><LI>  Feature Overview
<P>
</OL>2.1  ISDN Support
<P>
This release includes the support for internal ISDN adapters that was 
previously delivered in the ISDN 1.1 Accelerator Pack.  To assist in the 
setup process, an ISDN Configuration Wizard is automatically installed 
in the Start menu under Start&gt;Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;ISDN Tools.
<P>
2.2  Multilink Support
<P>
Multilink support enables your computer to use two communications ports 
as if they were a single port of twice the bandwidth.  The feature is 
most useful to ISDN users, since it allows them to use both sides of an 
ISDN line for an aggregate bandwidth of 128Kbps.  The feature is also 
available to modem users, but on most systems, the serial port overhead 
eliminates any benefit that could be gained from simultaneous use of two 
modem calls.  Multilink can be enabled from the Properties page of any 
connection icon in the Dial-Up Networking folder.
<P>
2.3  Scripting
<P>
Some Internet Service Providers require a terminal interaction with the 
user at the start of a dial-up connection.  The Scripting feature 
included in this Dial-Up Networking upgrade allows you to automate this 
<PRE>interaction.   Scripting is enabled from the Properties page of any 
</PRE></OL>connection icon in the Dial-Up Networking folder.  The scripting 
language is described in the file "script.doc" in your windows 
directory.
<P>
2.4  PPTP Client
<P>
This release includes the ability to create a PPTP tunneling client.  
Tunneling is a networking term describing the encapsulation of one 
protocol within another protocol. Tunneling is typically done to join 
two networks using an intermediate network which uses an incompatible 
protocol or which is under the administrative control of a third party.
<P>
2.4.1  PPTP Tunneling
<P>
PPTP is a tunneling protocol defined by the PPTP Forum that allows PPP 
packets to be encapsulated within Internet Protocol (IP) packets and 
forwarded over any IP network, including the Internet itself.  In order 
to run the Windows95 PPTP client, you must be able to establish an IP 
connection with a tunnel server such as the WindowsNT Server 4.0 Remote 
Access Server (RAS).
<P>
Windows Dial-Up Networking uses the Internet standard Point-to-Point 
Protocol (PPP) to provide a secure, optimized multiple-protocol network 
connection over dialed telephone lines.  PPTP adds the ability to treat 
<PRE>the Internet as point-to-point Dial-Up Networking connection.   All data 
</PRE>sent over this connection can be encrypted and compressed, and multiple 
<PRE>network level protocols (TCP/IP, NetBEUI, IPX) can be run concurrently.   
</PRE>WindowsNT Domain Login level security is preserved even across the 
<PRE>Internet.   PPTP can be used to connect to an Intranet that is otherwise 
</PRE>isolated from the Internet, and may even have Internet address space 
conflicts. 
<P>
PPTP appears as new modem type (Virtual Private Networking Adapter) that 
can be selected when setting up a connection in the Dial-Up Networking 
folder.  The VPN Adapter type does not appear elsewhere in the system.  
Since PPTP encapsulates its data stream in the PPP protocol, the VPN 
<PRE>requires a second dial-up adapter.   This second dial-up adapter for VPN 
</PRE>is added during the installation phase of the Upgrade in addition to the 
first dial-up adapter that provides PPP support for the analog or ISDN 
modem.
<P>
2.4.2  PPTP Connections
<P>
The "Make a New Connection" wizard (in the Dial-Up Networking folder) 
will guide you through the steps needed to create connection icons for 
either normal dial-up (modem) calls or PPTP (virtual private network) 
calls.  You indicate use of  PPTP by selecting VPN rather than a modem 
as your device type.  
<P>
2.4.2.1  Dial-up PPTP Connections
<P>
The most typical application for PPTP involves a dial-up PPP connection 
to the Internet followed by a separate PPTP connection to a remote 
tunnel server.  This "two call" sequence requires two connection icons 
<PRE>in the Dial-Up Networking folder, and two "dialing" actions by the user.   
</PRE>The results of a successful tunnel over the Internet are two network 
connections on your PC: one to the Internet, and one to the target 
network served by the tunnel server.  To understand the behavior of your 
PC in this configuration, see the discussion below regarding Default 
Routing to Remote TCP/IP Networks.
<P>
2.4.2.2  LAN-based PPTP Connections
<P>
A second application for PPTP involves a tunnel over a LAN to which your 
PC is already attached.  In this case, only a single connection icon is 
required, and only a single "dialing" action by the user in order to 
initiate the tunnel.  It is not necessary to have a Dial-Up Networking 
<PRE>connection to the Internet to support PPTP.   The ability to route 
</PRE>packets correctly to the PPTP tunnel server over an IP network is the 
only requirement for a PPTP connection.  Again, see the discussion below 
Default Routing to Remote TCP/IP Networks or the more detailed 
discussion in the file pptpinfo.doc in your windows directory.
<P>
2.5  Modem Pool Access
<P>
PPTP can be also used as a method for a LAN-based PC to make a dial-up 
connection to a remote network through a modem pool on the tunnel 
server.  
<P>
If your systems administrator has configured the tunnel server with 
several modems set aside for outbound calls, your PPTP client can cause 
these modems to initiate a PPP dial-out connection between your client 
and another network.  To cause such a connection, simply establish a 
PPTP connection whose tunnel address is specified as 
"TunnelServer&lt;space&gt;PhoneNumber".  TunnelServer is the DNS name or IP 
address of the tunnel server;  PhoneNumber is the set of digits to be 
dialed to reach the other network.  The tunnel server will bring up a 
dial-up PPP connection to the digits supplied.  On connection, your PC 
will behave as if it had dialed directly into the remote network.  
Authentication will be performed by the remote network.  Again, see the 
discussion below regarding Default Routing to Remote TCP/IP Networks or 
the more detailed discussion in the file pptpinfo.doc.

<OL><P><LI>  Known Bugs and Limitations
<P>
</OL>There are a number of network routing issues, known bugs and product 
limitations that affect network behavior when you are using Windows95 
Dial-Up Networking.  Network routing issues are discussed in the Default 
Routing to Remote TCP/IP Networks section below.  Bugs and product 
limitations are discussed in this section.
<P>
3.1  Name Resolution Issues
<P>
The original release of  Windows95 Dial-Up Networking had limited 
support for WINS and DNS name resolution when a PC was connected to 
multiple networks.  The Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade resolves all of 
the WINS limitations, and supplies a Winsock upgrade which you can 
install to resolve the remaining DNS limitations. 
<P>
A Winsock update installer (ws32upd.exe) has been placed in your 
windows\msdun directory.  Simply execute the installer and it will 
install a revised Winsock on your system.  This is a clean solution for 
most users.  However, there are a few network or internet applications 
which replace Winsock with their own version, or which use "hooking and 
chaining" techniques to attach their own features to the Microsoft 
version of Winsock.  You should uninstall such applications before 
running the Winsock installer, then re-install them when Winsock has 
been updated.  The Winsock Proxy component of Microsoft Proxy Server is 
an application of this sort.  You should uninstall Winsock Proxy before 
updating Winsock, then re-install it when you are finished.
<P>
The Winsock update installs a revised version of Winsock 1.1.  This 
version represents a minor change over the Winsock that was originally 
delivered with Windows95.  Microsoft has also released Winsock2, a 
complete redesign of the Winsock architecture.  Winsock2 is available 
from the Microsoft web site at www.microsoft.com.  It is fully 
compatible with the Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade
<P>
3.2  Static IP Address, WINS, and DNS Settings
<P>
In almost all cases, you should allow the network to define your PC's IP 
address, and to provide WINS and DNS server addresses when you 
successfully establish a PPP or PPTP connection.  In the rare cases 
where an ISP or systems administrator require you to set an IP address 
or to define addresses for WINS and/or DNS servers, you should do this 
in the appropriate connection icon.  (Use the TCP/IP Settings button on 
the Server Type tab of the Properties page for the icon.)  You should 
never set these TCP/IP properties for one of the Dial-up Adapters or 
your LAN adapter from the Network icon in the control panel.  Values set 
via the control panel are global settings that override the settings in 
individual connection icons, and may override any dynamic information 
established during a dial-up or PPTP connection.  In particular, setting 
a static WINS address on a LAN adapter will prevent dynamic WINS 
assignments on dial-up or PPTP connections.  Setting a static DNS 
address on the LAN adapter does not have this effect.  So additional DNS 
addresses will be obtained on a successful connection to a remote 
network.  (However a bug in the winipcfg utility will prevent these DNS 
addresses from being displayed.)
<P>
3.3  Remote Access after Physical Disconnection from a LAN
<P>
A addressing problem can occur when a computer that has been directly 
connected to a private TCP/IP network is physically disconnected and 
then attempts a dial-up or PPTP connection.  (This can happen, for 
example, when a laptop user disconnects an ethernet connection from the 
<PRE>corporate network and then tries to dial in from home.)   If the network 
</PRE></OL>card is still installed, TCP/IP may be configured so that the computers 
which could be reached through the netcard still appear reachable 
through the netcard.  Even after a modem Dial-Up Networking connection 
or a PPTP connection is established back to the same network, TCP/IP 
will continue to send all traffic for computers on the local network out 
the netcard.
<P>
The workaround, if the computer originally booted from DHCP, is to run 
the winipcfg utility and select the Release option.  If this does not 
fix the problem, the netcard may have been manually configured through 
the control panel, and will have to be disabled through the control 
panel.
<P>
3.4  Accessing Network Shares Across Private Networks
<P>
In the special case where two networks are under WindowsNT domain login 
security and they are in different, non-trusted domains,  it is not 
possible to tunnel across one network to reach hosts or servers on the 
second network.  Window95 logs into the first domain and cannot log in 
to a second domain.  The workaround is to skip the initial domain login 
(Cancel) and log into the second network when the PPTP connection is 
established.
<P>
Note that since the Internet does not employ domain login security, this 
problem will not occur when tunneling across the Internet.
<P>
3.5  Setting Encryption on Dial-up or PPTP Connection
<P>
There is no user control over encryption in the Windows95 Dial-Up 
Networking client.  Encryption is controlled by appropriate settings in 
the Windows NT Remote Access Server.  Due to a bug in the Windows95 
client, encryption must be requested with compression.  The server will 
not be able to negotiate encryption without compression.  (Note that the 
server can enable compression without encryption.)
<P>
3.6  Suspend Mode for Laptop PCs
<P>
You can suspend operation of a laptop PC by selecting Suspend from the 
Start menu.  Many machines offer a hardware Suspend button, but some of 
these do not provide adequate time for the software components of 
Windows95 to safely stop operation.  This will result in a crash on 
Resume.  You should always use the Start menu to suspend execution on 
the laptop.
<P>
3.7  Ejecting PCMCIA Net Cards
<P>
If you eject a PCMCIA ethernet card from a running laptop, then make a 
subsequent dial-up connection to a TCP/IP network, you will find that 
TCP/IP traffic is disabled.  No problem occurs if you eject the card 
while the machine is off, or if you eject the card during a successfully 
established TCP/IP connection.
<P>
3.8  ISDN1.0 Accelerator Pack Drivers
<P>
Windows95 now supports ISDN NDISWAN drivers that are binary compatible 
<PRE>with WindowsNT.   This has been the case since the release of the ISDN 
</PRE>Accelerator Pack 1.1, which required the use of WindowsNT-compatible 
<PRE>ISDN 1.1 drivers.   Consequently, most ISDN vendors supply ISDN 1.1 
drivers with their hardware.   Drivers compatible with the Windows95 
</PRE>ISDN Accelerator Pack 1.0 will no longer work.
<P>
See http;//www.microsoft.com/windows/getisdn for a list of known vendor 
drivers.  
<P>
3.9  ISDN Driver Installation
<P>
Many vendors bundle the old ISDN1.1 Accelerator Pack with their own 
device drivers on their installation diskette to simplify the 
installation process.  As a result, if a vendor's install procedure is 
run on a system that has been upgraded to 1.2, the install procedure may 
overwrite some of the upgraded files and leave various portions of the 
system unusable.  Typically, the vendor install will ask you if it is OK 
to install ISDN 1.0 or ISDN 1.1.  You should say "no".  
<P>
If you think that the vendor's install has overwritten Dial-Up 
Networking, you should immediately re-run the Dial-Up Networking 1.2 
Upgrade installation routine MSDUN12.exe. 
<P>
As a general note regarding ISDN driver installation, make sure you know 
the ISDN switch type, SPIDs, and phone numbers.  This information is 
<PRE>available from your telephone company.   You should have it before you 
</PRE>proceed.
<P>
3.10  Multilink Operation
<P>
After your additional devices are configured using the  procedure 
outlined in the previous section, you are ready  to dial your multilink 
connection. When you dial the connection, Dial Up Networking dials the 
primary number of the primary device  specified for the connection. Once 
the first connection is  established, Dial Up Networking will then dial 
<PRE>the other devices specified in the Additional Devices list.   

</PRE>Once the connections are established, you can view status  information 
about the link by double clicking on the  "communicating computers" icon 
displayed in the taskbar, or you  may disconnect the connection.  The 
status information includes the number of bytes sent and  received, the 
network protocols negotiated for use on the connection, and a list box 
showing each of the additional devices. As you highlight a device in the 
list box, a "Suspend"  or "Resume" button is displayed.  If a Suspend 
button is  displayed, then the device is now in use and "bundled" into 
the  multilink connection. Clicking on the "Suspend" button  disconnects 
that line and removes the line from the bundled  connections.  If the 
"Resume" button is displayed, then click on "Resume" to  dial that 
connection and add that line to the bundle. You may  suspend and resume 
individual links without dropping the  connection.
<P>
3.11  Dial-in Server Limitations
<P>
The Windows 95 Dial In Server supports only IPX and NetBeui clients.  
There is no support for a dial-in TCP/IP client.  Note that the Dial-in 
Server feature does not support multilink connections.

<OL><P><LI> Security Issues
<P>
</OL>PPTP provides a new level of security by employing existing PPP features 
to enable secure, encrypted access to a private network for selected 
clients on the internet without providing access to all of the potential 
clients on the internet.  The PPTP tunnel server controls this access by 
authenticating connection requests from the clients which request tunnel 
<PRE>connections to the private network.   Security can be further enhanced 
</PRE></OL>by enabling PPTP filtering on the tunnel server, or by placing the 
<PRE>tunnel server behind a firewall.   See the User and Administrator Guide 
</PRE>on Installing, Configuring and Using PPTP with Microsoft Clients and 
Servers for further information.
<P>
4.1  PPTP Filtering
<P>
PPTP filtering can be enabled on the tunnel server, and if enabled, 
allows only PPTP packets to pass into the tunnel server.  This 
immediately limits Internet access to PPTP clients.  When setting up a 
tunnel server, keep in mind that the ICMP Echo packets used by ping will 
<PRE>not pass through this filter and are simply discarded.   Consequently, 
</PRE>it may be useful to disable PPTP filtering during the shakedown period, 
and then enable PPTP filtering for production use.
<P>
4.2  Firewall Compatibility
<P>
PPTP traffic will pass through a properly configured firewall.  The PPTP 
tunnel control channel uses TCP port 1723.  Data packets are transmitted 
over IP using protocol ID 47 (GRE) with a GRE Protocol field of 0x880B.  
The firewall filters must be properly set to admit this traffic into the 
private network and to exit from the network.  Note that there are a few 
firewall products which cannot be configured to accept protocol 47. 
<P>
4.3  GRE Packet Filtering
<P>
Some networks utilize GRE messages for internal operations and have set 
their routers to prevent GRE packets from entering or leaving the 
network.  If the tunnel established correctly, but transmits no data, 
your Internet Service Provider may be screening GRE packets.  
<P>
4.4  Proxy Incompatibility
<P>
It is not possible to pass a PPTP session from a client through a proxy 
server to a remote tunnel server (or vice versa).  However, in many 
cases, one can achieve the same results by hosting a PPTP Tunnel Server 
and a Proxy Server on the same hardware server.

<OL><P><LI>  Network Routing Behavior
<P>
</OL>When a PPTP connection is established, the client network protocols will 
see an additional dial-up adapter become active.  PPTP itself uses 
TCP/IP to tunnel network packets, so at least one adapter in the client 
must be bound to, and running TCP/IP.  This adapter can be a NIC, in the 
case where the client is connecting to a PPTP server on a LAN.  The 
TCP/IP adapter can also be a dial-up adapter, in the case where the 
client is dialing into a RAS server or ISP, and then connecting to a 
PPTP server across a private Intranet or the public Internet.  The 
client must also support the network protocol of the target (private) 
network.  The behavior of NBF, IPX and TCP/IP clients are described 
below
<P>
5.1  NBF Clients
<P>
It is assumed that the PPTP client is connecting to an NT RAS/PPTP 
server.  NBF will work as expected.  The PPTP client will be able to see 
both the original network and the new network concurrently.  The client 
will be visible to computers on both LANs, but the networks will not be 
joined through the client.  The client's ability to see computers on the 
new network is provided by the WindowsNT Server's NetBIOS gateway.
<P>
5.2  IPX Clients
<P>
Once connected via PPTP, only the target network will be visible with 
IPX at that time.  This is unchanged from current Window95 dial-up IPX 
connections.  Currently, when IPX is selected in a phonebook entry and 
IPX is active on a NIC, a dialog is presented to the user (at dial time) 
explaining that Netware servers on the local LAN will no longer be 
visible once a connection is established to the remote LAN. Users will 
see this same dialog when establishing a PPTP connection.  
<P>
5.3  Default Routing to Remote TCP/IP Networks
<P>
All TCP/IP host computers (including your Windows95 PC) share a routing 
limitation that will be important for Dial-Up and PPTP users accessing 
remote TCP/IP networks.  Host computers rely on a routing scheme called 
default gateway routing.  This mechanism is simple: to reach any 
computer not on the local network, and not specified by any other 
routing table entries, forward the traffic to a specified default 
gateway router.  The gateway router generally knows how to forward the 
traffic correctly.  This approach has the advantage that your Windows95 
computer can connect to millions of other computers without complex 
routing tables.  This approach has the disadvantage that it assumes that 
there is only a single connection to all of the external networks it may 
wish to reach.
<P>
The default gateway concept works particularly well for a stand-alone PC 
that is dialing into a remote network.  When a dial-up connection is 
established, a default gateway is assigned to route traffic through that 
connection.
<P>
The concept breaks down when your PC already has a default gateway, and 
a second default gateway is assigned by Dial-Up Networking to reach a 
new network.  This could happen, for example, if your computer had a 
default route for its local LAN and then dialed an additional connection 
into a remote network.  It could also happen if your computer dialed 
into the Internet and then made a second PPTP connection to a remote 
tunnel server.  In both of these cases, the first gateway is replaced by 
the most recent gateway, and computers which were reachable though the 
first gateway will no longer be visible.  Note that a DNS or WINS name 
server that may be one of the computers that is hidden.  This will 
result in the inability to resolve computer names on the affected 
network.  
<P>
In summary, TCP/IP default gateway routing is designed to work with 
computers that connect to a single network.  A PPTP connection over a 
Dial-up link, or a Dial-Up connection from a LAN-based PC, result in two 
network connections..  In each case, the default route will point to the 
most recent connection.  When the PPTP or Dial-Up connection is 
released, all connectivity to the first network will be restored.
<P>
5.3.1  Static Routes
<P>
The workaround is to add a route entry to destination network or 
computer by using the route command from a DOS prompt. For matching 
traffic, TCP/IP will use this route rather than the default gateway.  
<P>
The following example walks through the case of dialing into an ISP and 
then establishing a tunnel to a private network. The abbreviated output 
below shows the default gateway after the dial-up connection has been 
established. The ping command is used to demonstrate that 
ww.microsoft.com can be reached across the Internet:

The default gateway is the entry with the Network Address of 0.0.0.0. 
This is the simple case of being connected to a single network (the 
Internet). There is only a single default gateway. 
<P>
The output below shows the assignment of a second default gateway after 
a PPTP connection has been established to a private network across the 
Internet. The more current gateway has the lowest Metric, and will be 
used to provide access to the private network. The gateway with the 
Metric 2 will not be used again until the PPTP connection is released.

Adding a static route in this form solves the problem:
<P>
C:\OSR2&gt;route add 207.68.137.65 206.63.152.32
<P>

The first number in the route add command is the IP address of the 
target computer and the second is the default gateway that has the 
Metric of 2.
<P>
Notice that we pinged www.microsoft.com by using the IP address returned 
<PRE>from the previous ping, rather than the name www.microsoft.com.   Why?   
</PRE>The process of converting an Internet computer name to an IP address is 
called name resolution, and uses a computer on the Internet called a 
Domain Name Server (DNS). The DNS computer IP addresses was entered for 
this dial-up connection in the phone book entry. Unfortunately, the DNS 
server itself becomes invisible after the 2nd default gateway becomes 
active. A ping by name will fail because the DNS server cannot be 
contacted to resolve the name.
<P>
C:\OSR2&gt;ping www.microsoft.com
Bad IP address www.microsoft.com.
<P>
The important thing to notice here is that the ping did not fail.  It 
didn't even get started because the name www.microsoft.com could not be 
translated into an address for ping to use. Adding a route to the DNS 
server itself fixes this.
<P>
C:\OSR2&gt;route add 198.137.231.1 206.63.152.32

<P>
Note that some DNS servers resolve the same name to different IP 
addresses at different times, typically for load-balancing. The only 
workaround for this is to add network route entries for all possible IP 
<PRE>addresses.  This is beyond the scope this document.   

</PRE>Finally, note that since a static route references the IP address of the 
dial-up connection, it can only be defined once the dial-up or PPTP 
connection has been established.
