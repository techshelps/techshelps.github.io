<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0 and 1.0a
<LI>Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0b, 3.2, 3.2a, and 3.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article is designed for the Schedule+ administrator and outlines the
procedures necessary for setting up schedule distribution on a multiple
postoffice network. If your Mail network has only one postoffice, you
should refer to Chapter 2 of the Microsoft Schedule+ "Administrator's
Guide." This chapter has the information for setting up schedule
distribution on a single postoffice network. This article is a supplement
to the Microsoft Schedule+ "Administrator's Guide."
<P>
This article explains the following parts of schedule distribution:

<UL><LI>The Schedule+ Administrator program (ADMINSCH.EXE)

<LI>The Dynamic Postoffice Connection

<LI>The Schedule Distribution program (SCHDIST.EXE).
<P>
</UL>Notes:

<UL><LI>Schedule+ requires a local area network (LAN) or wide area network
   (WAN) connection for a user to Open Other's Appointment Book on
   another postoffice and for access privileges of Read Appointments
   and Tasks or higher with Dynamic Postoffice Connection.

<LI>You can only run Schedule Distribution with the retail version
   of Microsoft Schedule+. Windows for Workgroups Schedule+ and
   Microsoft Windows NT Schedule+ do not allow the capability to
   share scheduling information with other postoffices. Therefore, it
   does not come with the Schedule+ Admin utility.
<P>
   In order to run schedule distribution against a Windows for
   Workgroups or Windows NT postoffice, the postoffice must be upgraded
   with the Microsoft Mail Server Upgrade, part number 068-695V350.
<P>
</UL><h3>Setting Up the Schedule+ Admin Account</h3>
 
<P>
Schedule+ requires that there is an account on the postoffice for the
Schedule+ Admin. This account is different than the Mail administrator
account. It must be created with the Microsoft Mail Administrator
program (ADMIN.EXE) using the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Microsoft Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) with the
    following command line from the \MAILEXE directory:
<P>
       admin.exe admin -ppassword -dx
<P>
    where admin represents the Mail Administrator's account; password
    is the ADMIN account's password, and x represents the drive letter
    of the postoffice you want to administer.

<P><LI>At the opening screen, Local Admin will be highlighted. Press the
    ENTER key.

<P><LI>With Create highlighted, press the ENTER key.

<P><LI>At the Mailbox Name prompt, type in adminsch to create a Schedule+
    Administrator account. Press ENTER.

<P><LI>At the Password prompt, you can either accept the default password, or
    type in the password of your choice. Press ENTER.
<P>
    Notes:
<P>
    - PASSWORD is the default password for Microsoft Mail accounts
      unless you have altered it. For more information refer to pages 69
      and 101 of the version 3.2 Microsoft Mail "Administrator's Guide,"
      or pages 66 and 95 for versions 3.0 and 3.0b.
<P>
    - This password will be used to login to the Schedule+ Admin.
      Note this password as you will be using it later in this process.

<P><LI>Enter the Full Name for the Schedule+ Administrator (for example,
    SchedulePlus Admin for My PO). Press ENTER.

<P><LI>At the User Type prompt, press ENTER for user.

<P><LI>Assign Delete, Send, Retrieve, and External user access privileges.
    Press ENTER.

<P><LI>Accept the default user folder privileges. Press ENTER.
<P>
    NOTE: Folder privileges are not necessary for the adminsch account.

<P><LI>Include the user in Directory Synchronization. Press ENTER.
<P>
    NOTE: The ADMINSCH account must be included in Directory
    Synchronization (Dir-Sync). It is recommended that you never login
    to this account in either Mail or Schedule+ as a user, as this
    will interfere with the schedule distribution process.

<P><LI>Press ENTER to create the new user.

<P><LI>In the Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE), select External-Admin,
    Export. Then select All.
<P>
    NOTE: You can either export all as suggested above, or wait for
    Dir-Sync to take place. Also from ADMIN.EXE, you can run a Config,
    Dir-Sync, Requestor, Export, followed by running a Manual Dir-Sync
    cycle.
<P>
    For more information on running a Manual Dir-Sync cycle, please
    refer to Application Note WA0725 "Directory Synchronization
    (Dir-Sync)."

<P><LI>Repeat steps 2 through 12 to create the adminsch account on
    each postoffice that is to participate in Schedule Distribution.
<P>
</OL><h3>Installing the Schedule+ Admin Files</h3>
 
<P>
In order to have your users exchange Schedule+ information with users on
other postoffices, you must run the Install program (INSTALL.EXE) and the
schedule distribution setup at least once on all of the postoffices that
will be participating in schedule distribution. It is strongly recommended
that you run the schedule distribution program (SCHDIST.EXE) on a different
workstation than the one running Schedule+ Admin.
<P>
NOTE: The following procedure is to install the Schedule+ Admin files only,
because this is all that is necessary for the purpose of this article. To
install the Schedule+ client files and program, run SETUP.EXE from Disk 2 -
Program Setup of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows.

<OL><P><LI>In File Manager, connect a drive (preferably M, if possible) to one
   of the postoffices that is participating in Schedule Distribution.
<P>
   NOTE: If you are running Microsoft Mail on a Novell network, make
   sure that the postoffice is at the root of the mapped drive. The
   Novell MAP ROOT command can be invoked to ensure this. If the
   postoffice is not at the root of the mapped drive, the Schedule+
   installation will not proceed.

<P><LI>From Program Manager and from the File menu, choose Run. Place the
   Schedule+ disk labeled Disk 1- Network Install in the appropriate disk
   drive. In the Run dialog box, type the path to the INSTALL.EXE file
   in the disk drive (for example, a:\install.exe).

<P><LI>From the Welcome screen, select Continue. Enter the proper registration
   information, and continue until you reach the Installation Procedures
   dialog box.

<P><LI>At the Installation Procedures dialog box, select Schedule+
   Administration Program, and select Continue.

<P><LI>Select Continue until you reach the Install Message dialog box.

<P><LI>At the Install Message dialog box, specify the directory that you want
   the Schedule+ Admin files to be stored (the default is C:\ADMINSCH).

<P><LI>Continue through the Install Now dialog box to start the installation
   procedure.

<P><LI>Insert the Schedule+ program disks, as prompted.

<P><LI>When you are notified that the installation has completed successfully,
   select the OK button.
<P>
   NOTE: The installation program will create a Schedule+ Admin icon
   for use in Windows.
<P>
</OL>THE SCHEDULE+ ADMIN PROGRAM (ADMINSCH.EXE)
<P>
The Schedule+ Admin program provides easy to use controls to set up and
maintain the Schedule+ system. With the Admin program, you can configure
Schedule+ to share schedule information across the network and to manage
schedule storage on the server. For the purpose of this article, managing
schedule storage on the server will not be discussed. For more information
on managing schedule storage on the server, please refer to pages 25-26 of
the Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows "Administrator's Guide."
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Up for Schedule Distribution with the Schedule+ Admin Program</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start the Schedule+ Admin program. When you install this program from
    the Network Install disk (disk 1), it creates a directory called
    ADMINSCH and installs the SCHDIST.EXE, MVCAL.EXE, and ADMINSCH.EXE
    programs. Except for the ADMINSCH.EXE program, all these programs run
    in MS-DOS.
<P>
    Notes:
<P>
    - You do not need to reinstall the Schedule+ Admin program for each
      postoffice; the one program works for multiple postoffices.
<P>
    - By default, the Schedule+ Admin program will use the Server Path
      and/ or Server Drive statements in the [Microsoft Mail] section of
      the MSMAIL.INI file. If no such statement exists, the postoffice is
      usually mapped to drive M.
<P>
      The Schedule+ Admin program looks for one of these settings. If you
      have mapped a drive other than the M drive to the root of the
      postoffice, you want to specify the following command line
      properties for the Schedule+ Admin:
<P>
<PRE>         adminsch /Dx /Ppassword

      where x represents the drive letter of the postoffice you want to
      administer, and password is the ADMINSCH account's password for
      that drive.

      The above command line properties can be added to the Schedule+
      Admin icon properties, or it can be run by choosing Run from the
      File menu in Program Manager.

</PRE><P><LI>From the Administration menu, choose Distribution Settings.

<P><LI>Choose the Add Postoffice or Add Gateway button (this depends on
    where the postoffice exists).
<P>
    NOTE: Two conditions must be met before a postoffice will show up in
    the Add Postoffice list:
<P>
     - The postoffices must have a Schedule+ Admin account (ADMINSCH)
       that participates in Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync).
<P>
     - The postoffices must be defined through External Admin in the
       Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE).
<P>
       For more information on Adding and Modifying Direct Route External
       Postoffices refer to pages 116-128 of the Microsoft Mail
       "Administrator's Guide" version 3.2, or pages 107-112 for versions
       3.0 and 3.0b.

<P><LI>In the Postoffices list box, double-click the name of the postoffice
    you want to add.
<P>
    NOTE: If no postoffices appear in this list, then either the ADMINSCH
    account created in Setting Up the Schedule+ Admin Account was not
    created correctly or the ADMINSCH accounts are not participating in
    Dir-Sync.
<P>
    In either case, follow the procedures for Setting Up the Schedule+
    Admin Account and start Setting Up for Schedule Distribution with the
    Schedule+ Admin Program again from step 1.

<P><LI>In the Distribution Settings dialog box, select the new postoffice in
    the Postoffices list. Then choose the Settings button.

<P><LI>Specify the sending times for the new postoffice or accept the
    default times.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 5 through 7 if there are still more postoffices you want
    to participate in Schedule Distribution.

<P><LI>Once all the postoffices have been registered, exit the Schedule+
    Admin program.

<P><LI>From File Manager, disconnect drive M and connect to a different
    postoffice that you want to configure for schedule distribution.
    This new postoffice must be connected in File Manager as drive M.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 1 through 9, as often as necessary.

<P><LI>Once all the postoffices have been added, exit the Schedule+ Admin
    program.
<P>
    NOTE: If this is not the first time you are trying to set up and run
    Schedule Distribution, please do the following to help run and
    configure Schedule Distribution:
<P>
    a. On each postoffice, change to the MAILDATA\CAL directory.
<P>
    b. Delete the following files:
<P>
       - ADMIN.PRF
       - Any *.POF files (please see note below)
<P>
    NOTE: Please read the following paragraphs that lists the specific 
    contents of a .POF file and what will be lost when deleting a .POF
    file.
<P>
    The Administrator Preference (ADMIN.PRF) file includes information
    on other postoffices and the Default Sending Times. This file will
    be recreated the first time you run the Adminsch program and re-
    register other postoffices.
<P>
    The 00000000.POF contains Free/Busy Times for users on the local
    postoffice. The local postoffice is 00000000.POF. All external
    postoffices will be 0000000n.POF, where n= &gt;0. The 00000000.POF
    file will be recreated when the first client logs into Schedule
    Plus, makes a change to their schedule and logs out.
<P>
    More importantly, the POF file will be empty at this point except
    for the one user's schedule who logged in to create it. In order to
    get all users' schedule information into the file, ALL users must
    log in and make changes to their schedule. While this is bound to
    happen eventually, the file will have incomplete information until
    the last user finally logs in and makes some changes to their
    schedule.
<P>
    The same holds true for resources. Someone must log into them and
    make a change in order for the 00000000.POF file to be updated with
    the resource's schedule.
<P>
    POF files also contain flags specifying which accounts are resources,
    lists of assistants as well as related options (including whether the
    assistant should only receive meeting responses), and access rights
    information. All of this will not be updated in the POF until the
    users have logged in to Schedule Plus and a change is made.
<P>
    c. Follow all steps in Setting Up the Schedule+ Admin Account and
       Setting Up for Schedule Distribution with the Schedule+ Admin
       Program above.
<P>
</OL><h3>Dynamic Postoffice Connection</h3>
 
<P>
Schedule+ can be configured through the Schedule+ Admin program so that,
with the correct access privileges, users on one postoffice can read and
make changes to the Appointment Books and Tasks lists of users on other
postoffices. This process is called dynamic postoffice connection. Once
dynamic postoffice connection is set up, Schedule+ automatically connects
to other postoffices when users want to view the detailed schedules
(anything other than Free/Busy Times) of users on other postoffices, even
if the user is not attached or mapped to that other postoffice on his or
her local workstation.
<P>
Dynamic postoffice connection establishes an actual network connection
between postoffices instead of sending Free/Busy message packets, so it
allows users on one postoffice to look at and work with, depending on the
access privileges on the schedule, the most current schedule information
for users on other postoffices.
<P>
Dynamic postoffice connection requires a LAN or WAN connection between the
postoffices and will NOT work via X.25 or asynchronous (modem) connection.
Network traffic may increase because every Schedule+ user can connect to
multiple postoffices. To reduce this traffic, the schedule distribution
program (SCHDIST.EXE) can be used to send updates of the Free/Busy
information on the postoffice at least once a day, the more frequent the
updates, the less likely that the users will be opening another user's
appointment book, and the less network traffic created.
<P>
Schedule+, by default, will check if the user is mapped or attached to the
server that the other postoffice resides on. If the user is mapped or
attached already, it will use that connection. If the user is not
connected to the server the postoffice resides on, it will use the login
specified in the Modify Distribution Frequency dialog box.
<P>
NOTE: Before users can dynamically connect to other postoffices, they must
have the proper network privileges on the other file servers that contain
the other postoffices, or the user that is specified in the Modify
Distribution Frequency dialog box must have the proper rights.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting up Dynamic Postoffice Connection from the Schedule+ Admin Program</h3>
 
<P>
The steps below are necessary to ensure that Schedule+ Dynamic Connection
has been configured properly for Novell NetWare, Microsoft LAN Manager, and
Banyan VINES networks.

<OL><P><LI>From the Administration menu, choose Distribution Settings.

<P><LI>Select the desired PO.

<P><LI>Choose Settings.

<P><LI>Make the following changes to the Modify Distribution Frequency
   dialog box:
<P>
   For Novell NetWare:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Dynamic Connection Information
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Network Path: Server\Volume:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Directory: &lt;path to MAILDATA&gt;
</PRE><P>
   Notes:
<P>
   - If Network Path points to the root of the MAILDATA directory, you do
<P><PRE>     not need to enter the Directory data. If Network Path does not point
     to the MAILDATA directory, you must enter the directory path to
     that directory.
</PRE><P>
   - The following password and user name are required only if user-level
<P><PRE>     security is being implemented on the Novell postoffice server:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     Password: The password corresponding to the Username given below.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     Username: An account created for guests to view the contents of a
<PRE></PRE>               user's calendar file from another postoffice server.

   For Microsoft LAN Manager and Microsoft Windows NT:

      Dynamic Connection Information

      Network Path: \\Server\Share

      Directory: &lt;path to MAILDATA&gt;

   NOTE: If Network Path points to the root of the MAILDATA directory,
   you do not to enter data. If Network Path does not point to the MAILDATA
   directory, you must enter the directory path to that directory.

   For Banyan VINES:

      Dynamic Connection Information

      Network Path: File Svcs@Group@Org

   NOTE: This is the Banyan VINES file service StreetTalk name that is set
   up by the Network System Administrator when you build the server and
   load the application software.

      Directory: &lt;path to MAILDATA&gt;

   Notes:

   - If File Services points to the root of the MAILDATA directory, you do
     not need to enter data. If File Services does not point to the
     MAILDATA directory, you must enter the directory path to that
     directory.

   - The password and user name below are only required if user-level
     security is being implemented on the Banyan VINES postoffice server:

     Password: The password corresponding to the Username given below.

     Username: An account created for guests to view the contents of a
               user's calendar file from another postoffice server.

</PRE></OL><h3>The Schedule Distribution Program (SCHDIST.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
Schedule distribution is the process that sends users' Free/Busy Times and
assistants' name (if designated), as well as resource information between
postoffices at regular intervals. This information is sent as schedule
distribution messages---specially formatted Mail messages that are sent to
the Schedule+ administrator account (ADMINSCH) on the recipient postoffice.
<P>
As a user changes his or her schedule, the updated resource, assistant, and
Free/Busy information is updated in a .POF file in the \CAL subdirectory of
the user's home postoffice. There is one .POF file for each postoffice
participating in schedule distribution in the system; it contains the
information for all users on that postoffice. At the regular intervals that
you specify in the Schedule+ Admin program (ADMINSCH.EXE), SCHDIST.EXE
takes a "snapshot" of the .POF file for each postoffice you have set it to
exchange information with. It then compiles the information from that
snapshot into a collection of schedule distribution or Mail messages to be
sent by the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) to the other postoffices.
<P>
The more frequently you run schedule distribution, the more accurate that
the Free/Busy information will be. You can choose to run schedule
distribution on a postoffice-by-postoffice basis, or it can be done on
several postoffices at once.
<P>
Because each user controls other users' access to his or her schedule
(through the Set Access Privileges option), users who assign None as the
default access privilege to their schedule (or .CAL file) do not have their
schedule information distributed regardless of how you set up the schedule
distribution.
<P>
The schedule distribution program (SCHDIST.EXE) cannot work alone. It
requires the Schedule+ Admin program to setup the schedule distribution
times as well as the postoffices to which the schedules will be
distributed. SCHDIST.EXE also requires the Message Transport Agent
(EXTERNAL.EXE) to distribute the updates.
<P>
NOTE: The schedule distribution program is responsible for updating
Free/Busy information ONLY. Free/Busy information is viewed through the
Planner area of Schedule+. To be able to Read Appointments and Tasks or
above, the Dynamic Postoffice Connections must be used.
<P>
<P><h3>Running SCHDIST.EXE as an Idle Process in Dispatch</h3>
 
<P>
Versions 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows use the Schedule
Distribution (Schdist) program (SCHDIST.EXE) to distribute an user's
Free/Busy Times to other postoffices. You can run the Schdist program as an
idle process in the Dispatch program (DISPATCH.EXE).
<P>
The Dispatch program carries out directory synchronization (Dir-Sync)
requests on the network. The Dispatch program polls the postoffices to
determine when a Dir-Sync event is scheduled to take place. When Dispatch
is running, the EXTERNAL.EXE must also be running.
<P>
Schdist takes advantage of Dispatch polling the postoffices, and runs as an
idle process. Schdist runs while External is not active.
<P>
The following examples show commands and batch files for using SCHDIST.EXE
and EXTERNAL.EXE as idle processes in DISPATCH.EXE for two different
situations:

<OL><P><LI>If you want Dispatch to contain the IdleProcessMinPeriod (-TL) and
   IdleProcessMaxPeriod (-TU) parameters, use the following command line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dispatch -dxx -i"&lt;batchfile&gt;.bat" -tln -tun -l&lt;path\filename&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where -Dxx specifies the direct drives; -I specifies the idle program,
   and -L specifies the log file path and filename. To have Schdist
   running as an idle process, include SCHDIST.EXE in a batch file.
   For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dispatch -dmp -i"file.bat" -tl30 -tu60 -lc:\logs\mail.log
</PRE><P>
   The FILE.BAT batch file would look like the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;path&gt;schdist.exe -dxx -i1 -lc:\logs\schdist.txt
      &lt;path&gt;external.exe -dxx -a -lc:\logs\external.txt %1
</PRE><P>
</OL>NOTE: In this setup, the -TU time in the Dispatch command line is passed to
the External command line. This parameter becomes the break relative (-BR)
time that exits out of External and passes control back to Dispatch.
<P>
If you are having problems running this batch file against Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks postoffices with MS-DOS 5.0, refer to "Appendix A: Dispatch
Cannot Spawn Batch File Without COMMAND.COM" section below for more
information.

<OL><P><LI>If you want the batch file to control the time for exiting out of the
   idle process, use the following command line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dispatch -dxx -i"&lt;batchfile&gt;.bat" -l&lt;path\filename&gt;
</PRE><P>
   For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dispatch -dmn -i"file.bat" -lc:\logs\mail.log
</PRE><P>
   The FILE.BAT batch file would look like the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;path&gt;schdist.exe -dxx -i1 -lc:\logs\schdist.txt
      &lt;path&gt;external.exe -dxx -a -lc:\logs\external.txt -brdd:hh:mm
</PRE><P>
   Notes:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - In this setup, the -BR time determines when External exits and
      passes control back to Dispatch.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - You must remove the -A parameter in the External command line if you
      are using a modem. You should only use &lt;path&gt; placeholder if the
      SCHDIST.EXE and EXTERNAL.EXE files are not in the current directory.
      It is best if you copy the following files to a directory on the
      dedicated machine that will run this process (MS-DOS only):
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         DISPATCH.EXE       NSDA.EXE          REQMAIN.EXE
         SRVMAIN.EXE        REBUILD.EXE       IMPORT.EXE
         EXTERNAL.EXE       ASYNC.OVL         EXTERNAL.HLP
         X25EICON.OVL       X25ATLAN.OVL      SCHDIST.EXE

</PRE></OL>The schedule distribution program (SCHDIST.EXE) works with direct drives
only. The workstation running schedule distribution program (SCHDIST.EXE)
must be connected to the root of the \MAILDATA directory for each
postoffice it is creating updates for. On a Novell network with the
limitation of connecting to eight servers at a time, it may be necessary to
have more than one workstation running the schedule distribution program.
<P>
Another alternative to the Schedule Distribution Program (SCHDIST.EXE) is
to use the Dynamically Connect to View Free/Busy Times option. This is an
option in the Modify Distribution Settings dialog box shown on page 24 of
the Schedule+ "Administrator's Guide."
<P>
<P><h3>Appendix A: Troubleshooting</h3>

<P>
<PRE>   a. Make sure that the other postoffice(s) have an adminsch account that
      is participating in Directory Synchronization (whether you are using
      Dir-Sync or not).

   b. Make sure that the postoffices are defined with the Mail
      Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) in External-Admin.

</PRE>Problem:
<P>
<PRE>   In the Schedule+ Administrator program Last Update Received is always
   NEVER.

</PRE>Resolution(s):
<P>
<PRE>   Change the Default Sending Times in the Distribution Settings dialog box
   from Never.

</PRE>Problem:
<P>
<PRE>   SCHDIST Error: Could not process message

</PRE>Resolution(s):
<P>
<PRE>   This error occurs when SCHDIST.EXE is unable to access the ADMINSCH
   mailbox for mail with "free and busy time" information to create or
   recreate .POF files.

   Use the following procedure to troubleshoot this issue:

   1. Delete the following files in the CAL directory on the problem
      PO or all POs:

      - ADMIN.PRF
      - Any *.POF files that may exist

      The ADMIN.PRF file includes information on other postoffices and
      the Default Sending Times.

   2. On each PO that you have deleted the files, recreate the ADMIN.PRF
      file by running the Schedule+ Admin program(ADMINSCH.EXE) and
      re-register the external postoffices.

      NOTE: The 00000000.POF contains Free/Busy Times for users on the
      local postoffice. The local postoffice is 00000000.POF. All external
      postoffices will be 0000000n.POF, where n= &gt;0. These files will
      be re-created when you run Schedule Distribution (Schdist).

   3. Reset the ADMINSCH mailbox on the problem postoffice.

   NOTE: ADMINSCH is the mailbox where the mail that contains "free and
   busy time" information is put and retrieved by the Schdist program.

   4. Make changes to the appointment book (CAL file) for the problem
      user(s).

   5. Restart the Schedule Distribution program (SCHDIST.EXE) with at
      least the command line switches of:

         D&lt;driverange&gt; -V -L&lt;filename&gt;

      For example:

         schdist -dmp -v -lc:\schdist.txt

   3. Restart External with at least the following command line
      switches of to create log files that record all mail traffic into
      and out of the postoffice:

         -D&lt;driverange&gt; -V -L -MR -MS, where -MR and  -MS

   Notes:

   - This step does the actual delivery of mail between the POs.

   - The postoffice SENT.LOG, RECV.LOG, and SCHDIST.LOG files are
     valuable in determining whether or not Free/Busy Time mail
     were exchanged between the ADMINSCH accounts.

   Other factors that have been associated with this error are:

     - Novell NetWare ownerless files
     - Network rights
     - Schedule Distribution across an SMTP or PROFS gateway
     - A dirty network

</PRE>Problem:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot open Other's Appointment Book.

</PRE>Resolution(s):
<P>
<PRE>   Check all of the following:

   - For Novell networks, ensure that the proper rights are assigned for
     the user in the Modify Distribution Frequency dialog box. The proper
     rights are Read, Write, Create, Erase, Modify, and Filescan [RWCEMF].

   - Check to see if all the settings are correct.

   - Check with the user who's appointment book you are trying to open
     to see if the proper access privileges have been assigned.

   - Check the External-Admin settings for the postoffice the user resides
     on. If the external postoffice is via modem or X.25 then the other
     appointment book cannot be accessed. Only Free/Busy Times in the
     Planner can be viewed. Schedule+ does not work via asynchronous
     connections for access privileges above Free/Busy Times.

   - Make sure that mail can be sent to and received by the user. The
     user's mailbox (.MBG and .KEY), schedule file (.CAL), and/or message
     file (.MMF) could be corrupt.

</PRE><h3>Appendix B: Dispatch Cannot Spawn Batch File Without COMMAND.COM</h3>
 
<P>
Symptoms:
<P>
<PRE>   When the Dispatch program specifies a batch file with multiple
   executables as the idle process and COMMAND.COM cannot be found,
   only the first executable is performed; the others are ignored.

</PRE>Cause:
<P>
<PRE>   The Dispatch program searches for COMMAND.COM after completing the first
   executable. The program returns to Dispatch from the idle process when
   it fails to locate COMMAND.COM. This can be seen when you run
   Dispatch &gt; ERROR.TXT; the ERROR.TXT file records the error:

      Invalid COMMAND.COM
      Cannot start COMMAND, exiting

   This problem occurs only for certain versions of MS-DOS. The following
   table shows which versions cause Dispatch to fail to spawn the second
   batch file executable:

   Dispatch version      MS-DOS version           Result
</PRE> 
<PRE>   3.0                   3.3, 5.0, 6.0            Success in all cases

   3.2                   3.3, 6.0                 Success if COMMAND.COM
                                                  is in the current
                                                  directory of focus

   3.2                   5.0                      Failure

</PRE>Resolution
<P>
<PRE>   Ensure that a copy of the current version of COMMAND.COM is available
   in the directory from which dispatch is executed. Also check your
   version of MS-DOS against the above table.

   NOTE: You can also check the following lines in your configuration
   files for the External MTA:

      SHELL= in CONFIG.SYS file
      COMSPEC= in AUTOEXEC.BAT file
      Network variables in the network login script for the MTA user.

</PRE><h3>Appendix C: The Schedule Distribution Program (SCHDIST.EXE)</h3>
 
<P>
Command-Line Parameters:
<P>
You can use the following command-line parameters when you run the schedule
distribution program (SCHDIST.EXE) for versions 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft
Schedule+ for Windows:
<P>
<PRE>Parameter     Description
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE> -Dxy         Specifies the drives to be processed, where x is the first
              drive to be processed and y is the last.

 -In          Indicates the number of times to cycle through the specified
              postoffices. If n is left blank, Schedule Distribution
              runs until it is stopped manually.

 -L&lt;path&gt;     Tells the program to generate a log file in the path
              specified.

 -O           Enables Free/Busy sharing with other applications.
              Run Schedule Distribution with this option if you use
              other applications that share Free/Busy information
              with Schedule+.

 -V           Tells the program to shows more detail in its screen
              and Log file output.

</PRE><h3>Appendix D: Gateway to PROFS: Requirement for Free and Busy Times</h3>
 
<P>
Symptoms
<P>
<PRE>   When you use version 3.4a.0041 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS,
   Free and Busy Times are being sent from PROFS to Microsoft Mail for
   PC Networks, (ms-csm to adminsch), but may not be viewable by the
   user in Microsoft Schedule+ Planner view.

</PRE>Cause
<P>
<PRE>   You may have upgraded to version 3.2a of Mail for PC Networks. Mail
   for PC Networks version 3.2a has a file called TRNSCHED.DLL dated
   8-17-94 with a size of 12,960 bytes.

</PRE>Resolution
<P>
<PRE>   The PROFS gateway requires TRNSCHED.DLL dated 3-16-94 with a size
   of 13,104 bytes. It is on Disk 1 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to
   IBM PROFS and Office Vision, version 3.4a.0041. Replace the 3.2a
   version with this version of the TRNSCHED.DLL.

</PRE><h3>Appendix E: Add Gateway Brings Up All Gateways</h3>
 
<P>
In the Schedule+ Administration program, if you bring up the Add Gateways
window from the Distribution Settings window, it will show all the gateways
installed in the postoffice, even if there are no compatible scheduling
programs on the other side of these gateways. Adding any of these gateways
will enable SCHDIST to begin sending updates that the gateway does not
understand. This may cause the gateway to start displaying error messages.
<P>
This feature allows for future compatibility with foreign scheduling
systems, such as IBM PROFS, without requiring an update of the Schedule+
Administration program. To determine if the gateway and Schedule+ are
compatible, check with the manufacturer of the foreign scheduling system or
with a Microsoft Mail Product Support Engineer.
<P>
<P><h3>Appendix F: Do You Need the SCHDIST.EXE Update?</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Software Library update, SCHDIST.EXE, contains SCHDIST.EXE
that is a replacement for the SCHDIST.EXE file that is included with
version 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows.
