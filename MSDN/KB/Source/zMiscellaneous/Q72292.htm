<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the various types of "carriage returns" that are 
available in WordPerfect and Word for Windows, and how those returns are 
converted from one product to the other.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WordPerfect 5.x and 6.x hard and soft returns are supported in conversion
to Word. WordPerfect's dormant hard returns are converted to normal
paragraph marks.
<P>
Differences in character spacing between the two products may cause
soft returns to be located in different locations than they appear in
the original WordPerfect document.
<P>
Leading for hard returns (secondary leading) is converted to spacing after
import from WordPerfect only. Leading for soft returns (Primary leading)
is not supported for conversion.
<P>
Soft returns are automatically inserted by WordPerfect when text
reaches the end of a line; a hard return is inserted by pressing
ENTER.
<P>
A WordPerfect dormant hard return dictates that if a hard return
appears alone on a line at the top of a page that starts with a soft
page break, it will be changed from a hard return code into a dormant
hard return code. This is done so that the text at the top of the document 
is not needlessly shifted downward.
<P>
The most common instance in which a dormant hard return is inserted in
WordPerfect occurs if a user manually presses ENTER twice between the last
paragraph of one page and the first paragraph on the next page. In this
case, the formatting appears in Reveal Codes similar to:
<P>
<PRE>   Text at end of first page...[HRt-SPg]
   [Dorm HRt]Text at beginning of following page...

</PRE>Given printer driver differences, the WordPerfect converter supplied with
Word has no way to determine if a dormant hard return code will actually
remain located at the top of a page following conversion, and therefore
it converts the code to a normal paragraph mark. The result is that an
unwanted blank line may appear in a converted document.
<P>
The solution is to delete the extra paragraph mark following conversion. If
the unwanted paragraph mark appears at the top of a page in the converted
document, set Paragraph Spacing After to 12 pts in the last paragraph of
the preceding pagefirst page to restore original layout. This process can
be automated using Word's Autoformat feature, which converts manual double-
spacing between paragraphs into paragraph spacing after.
