The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Macintosh system software versions 7.0, 7.01, 7.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Apple LaserWriter driver versions 8.0 and later make it possible to
export a document's image as an EPS file from any application. This is a
new feature in the Apple LaserWriter 8.x, Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet
8.x, and Adobe PSPrinter 8.x drivers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Apple and HP PostScript drivers are based on the Adobe PSPrinter driver 
and therefore share the same characteristics. These drivers can generate 
four types of PostScript/EPS files: PostScript Job, EPS Mac Standard 
Preview, EPS Mac Enhanced Preview, and EPS No Preview. Each of these 
formats can be saved as ASCII or binary files, and you can select either 
the Level 1 Compatible option or the Level 2 Only option.
<P>
In addition, these drivers also support inclusion of font descriptions in
the exported EPS or PostScript file. There are three options: None, All,
and All But Standard 13.
<P>
To access the dialog box for creating a PostScript or EPS file, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the document for which you want to create a PostScript or EPS
   file.

<P><LI>For Destination, select the File option button. (The Print button
   then changes to a Save button.

<P><LI>Choose the Save button. (The printer driver then displays a dialog box
   containing EPS and PostScript file options and a place to enter a
   filename.)
<P>
</OL><h3>Definition Of Terms</h3>
 
<P>
Following are definitions of the Adobe PSPrinter driver options mentioned
above:
<P>
PostScript Job: 
This option saves a standard PostScript file, which can
contain all the commands and operators in the Adobe PostScript language.
This option generates a PostScript file that is useful for transport
purposes (moving the file to a machine connected to a PostScript device
when no PostScript device is available on the Macintosh on which the
document was created). Formatting and fonts are preserved entirely,
provided the fonts are available on the sending machine.
<P>
EPS Mac Standard Preview: 
This option generates an EPS file with a standard black-and-white Macintosh 
preview image. Use this option to minimize file size but provide an image 
for viewing the EPS file on the screen.
<P>
EPS Mac Enhanced Preview: 
This option generates an EPS file with a color Macintosh preview image, 
which can be printed to nonPostScript printers when inserted in an 
application document.
<P>
EPS No Preview: 
This option generates an EPS file that does not contain a
Macintosh preview image. This format can be used on other platforms
(MS-DOS, Windows, and UNIX). This format also minimizes the file size of
the resulting EPS file because no embedded preview image is included.
<P>
NOTE: Because of the strict definition of an EPS file, it can contain data
for one page of a document only. If you want to generate EPS files for your 
entire document, each page must be printed separately to an EPS file. A 
PostScript file can contain multiple pages, but generally, PostScript files 
cannot be imported in applications as EPS files can.
<P>
Level 1 Compatibility: This option generates a PostScript or EPS file that
is compatible with both PostScript Level 1 and 2 devices.
<P>
Level 2 Only: This option generates a PostScript or EPS file that is
compatible only with PostScript Level 2 devices.
<P>
ASCII: This option saves the PostScript or EPS file as a plain text file
using only ASCII values 32-127. This option is necessary for transmitting
the file through modes that support only the lower ASCII values. This is
the normal format for PostScript files.
<P>
Binary: This option saves the file in 8-bit binary format. Using binary
format can speed up printing, but the printer must be capable of receiving
binary data.
