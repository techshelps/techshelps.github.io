Update to Windows 95
Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1 includes an update for the English
version of Windows 95. Installing this updates your version of Windows 95
to version 4.00.950a. This section explains how to install the update and
describes the contents of the update.
<P>
<P>
Notes
The update is designed to solve specific issues. If these issues do not
apply to your configuration(s), you might not need to install the update.
For more information about the Update, see the section "What Does the
Windows 95 Service Pack 1Update Do?" later in this document.
If you are a system administrator who maintains a Windows 95 network
installation site, you should read Admin.doc. Admin.doc explains how to
update your network installation site so that any future installations will
include the updated components. Admin.doc is located in the \Admin folder
on the Windows 95 Service Pack CD.
<P>
<P>
Installing the Windows 95 Service Pack 1 Update
This section explains how to install the Service Pack 1 Update on a
computer running Windows 95.
<P>
To install the update on a single computer:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Quit any applications that are currently running. If you use
      the Microsoft Plus! System Agent, right-click the System Agent
      icon on the toolbar, and then click Suspend System Agent.

   2. Insert the Windows 95 Service Pack 1 CD or Disk 1.

   3.Double-click Setup.exe, and then follow the instructions on
      your screen.


</PRE>Notes
Do not click Cancel during Setup; doing so can cause Setup to fail. This
may be true even though a message is displayed stating that your system was
updated successfully.
If you cancel Setup by mistake, run Setup again. If you are asked "Do you
want to overwrite the file:" click Yes To All.
<P>
When the Setup program completes, your version of Windows 95 will be
updated to version 4.00.950a.
<P>
To remove the update from your computer:
<P>
<PRE>   1.   Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
      Control Panel.

   2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

   3.   Click the Install/Uninstall tab, click Windows 95 Service Pack
      1, and then click Add/Remove.

   4. Follow the instructions on your screen.


</PRE>Notes
Removing the updates from your computer will remove all updates except the
Password List Update and your system version will remain 4.00.950a. The
original Password List version cannot read the new password list. If you
would like to remove the Service Pack 1 Update completely, you should
reinstall Windows 95 from your original upgrade disks over the existing
Windows 95 installation.
If you cancel the uninstall process, you might see a message stating
uninstall has completed successfully even though it has not done so.
<P>
What Does the Windows 95 Service Pack 1 Update Do?
This section briefly describes each of the contents of the Service Pack
Update.
<P>
OLE32 Update
<P>
The Windows 95 OLE 32 update addresses file-management behavior in
Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95.
<P>
Microsoft Windows 95 Shell Update
<P>
This update to the Windows 95 Shell32.dll file fixes a problem in which
files copied onto themselves can be truncated to a zero-byte file size.
This update to Shell32.dll also makes it possible to browse NetWare
Directory Service printers from the Add Printer wizard.
<P>
Windows 95 Common Dialog Update for Windows 3.1 Legacy Printer Drivers
<P>
In Windows 95, when 32-bit applications print using Windows 3.1 monolithic
drivers or the Windows 3.1 Pscript.drv / Unidrv.dll driver, the
applications sometimes fail. This update addresses that problem.
<P>
Vserver Update: File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks
<P>
Microsoft is issuing an update for a known problem with File and Printer
Sharing for Microsoft Networks and a certain UNIX shareware network client
(Samba's SMBCLIENT). The update corrects a problem with share-level
security.
<P>
NWServer Update: File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks
<P>
Microsoft was recently made aware of an issue with File and Printer sharing
for NetWare Networks which might affect data security for corporate users.

Vredir Update
<P>
The Vredir Update fixes a problem that affects only Windows 95 users who
use UNIX Samba servers.
<P>
Windows 95 Password List Update
<P>
The Windows 95 Password List Update protects your password file against
potential security violations.
<P>
Microsoft Plus! Update (System Agent Update)
<P>
The Microsoft Plus! Update provides an updated version of Sage.dll to fix a
minor problem with System Agent: When version 1.0 System Agent is running,
programs that perform floating-point calculations might be slightly off in
precision.
<P>
Printer Port (Lpt.vxd) Update
<P>
The Service Pack 1 will automatically install a version of the parallel
port driver (Lpt.vxd) that was also available previously on the Windows 95
CD in the \Drivers\Printer\LPT folder. This driver corrects problems seen
on some ECP (Extended Capabilities Port) equipped machines.
<P>
<P>
