<P>
<PRE>   The selected message could not be deleted.
   An error has occurred.

</PRE>NOTE: You may also receive these error messages if the "Empty messages
from the Deleted Items folder" option is enabled.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

   a. On the File menu, point to Folder, point to Compact, and then click
<P><PRE>      Deleted Items.
</PRE><P>
   b. Quit and restart Internet Mail.
<P>
   Try to delete a message from the Deleted Items folder. If you still
   receive error messages, continue with step 2.

<P><LI>Quit Internet Mail by clicking Close on the File menu.

<P><LI>Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

<P><LI>In the Named box, type "Deleted Items.mbx" and "Deleted Items.idx"
  (including quotation marks), and then click Find Now.

<P><LI>Right-click the "Deleted Items.mbx" file, and then click Rename on the
   menu that appears.

<P><LI>Type a new name for the file, and then press the ENTER key.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the "Deleted Items.idx" file.
<P>
   NOTE: If your computer is configured for User Profiles, be sure to use
   the correct "Deleted Items.mbx" and "Deleted Items.idx" files located
   in the Program Files\Internet Mail and News\&lt;Username&gt;\Mail folder,
   where &lt;Username&gt; is the name you use to log into Windows 95.

<P><LI>Restart Internet Mail. The "Deleted Items.mbx" and "Deleted Items.idx"
   files will be automatically re-created.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The symptoms in this article may also occur when you try to delete a
message from the Outbox. To resolve the issue, apply the resolution above
to the Outbox. For example, instead of renaming the "Deleted Items.mbx"
and "Deleted Items.idx" files, you rename the Outbox.mbx and Outbox.idx
files.
