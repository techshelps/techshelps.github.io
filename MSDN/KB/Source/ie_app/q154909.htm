<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes steps to help you troubleshoot problems receiving
mail in Internet Mail.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are experiencing problems receiving mail in Internet Mail, try the
following steps to determine the cause.
<P>
<P><h3>Verify the Connection to the Mail Server</h3>
 
<P>
In order to use Internet Mail, you must have a connection to the Internet
through your Internet service provider (ISP) or your local intranet.
Internet Mail provides three options for this connection. To modify these
options, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Mail menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the Connection tab.
<P>
</OL>The connection options include:

<UL><LI>Using a LAN Connection
<P>
   This means you connect to the Internet through your local area network.

<LI>Connecting Manually
<P>
   Use this option if you want to dial into your ISP or intranet before
   starting Internet Mail.

<LI>Using a Modem to Access Your E-mail
<P>
   This option instructs Internet Mail to use an existing Dial-Up
   Networking connection to establish a connection.
<P>
</UL>To be sure you are connecting to your ISP correctly, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the option to connect manually.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then quit Internet Mail.

<P><LI>Connect to your ISP or intranet using a Dial-Up Networking connection.
<P>
</OL>If this works properly, go to the next step. If not, check your connection
and network settings. For more information about creating and trouble-
shooting a Dial-Up Networking connection to connect to the Internet,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How to Connect to the Internet in Windows 95

</PRE></OL><h3>Downloading New Messages</h3>
 
<P>
Internet Mail, by default, does not download your mail messages
automatically. To download messages manually, click the Send And Receive
button on the toolbar. This transfers messages from your mail server to
your local message store.
<P>
You can configure Internet Mail to automatically send and receive messages
by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Mail menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the Read tab.

<P><LI>Click the "Check for new messages every &lt;n&gt; minutes" to select it.
   Set the value of &lt;n&gt; to the interval at which you want Internet Mail
   to check for new messages to download. The default is 10 minutes.
<P>
</OL><h3>Sending Mail to Yourself</h3>
 
<P>
Sending mail to yourself checks the connection to your ISP or intranet and
mail server. If this works properly, Internet Mail is communicating with
your mail server. If this does not work, it may indicate a problem with
the mail server, or perhaps a problem with the sending computer. Contact
your ISP or network administrator for more information about resolving
this problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Check Server Settings and Configuration</h3>
 
<P>
Your server settings must be correct in order for Internet Mail to work
properly. To access these settings, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Mail menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the Server tab, and then check the following settings:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - POP3 and SMTP Server Names
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) and Post Office Protocol 3
      (POP3) server names are sometimes but not always the same. To verify
      the correct server names, contact your ISP or network administrator.
      Also, make sure the account name and password are entered correctly.
      If you do not know, or have forgotten these settings, contact your
      ISP or network administrator.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Message Size Limit
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Internet Mail provides the ability to not download messages over a
      predetermined size. To do this, follow these steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       a. Click Advanced Settings.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       b. If the "Do not download messages over &lt;n&gt; KB" check box is
<PRE></PRE>          selected, make sure the limit is not set too low. The default is
          1000 kilobytes (KB).

    - POP3 Port Number

      The default value is 110, but you may need to check with your ISP or
      network administrator to determine if this value is correct.

    - Server Timeout

      The server timeout setting indicates how long Internet Mail attempts
      to connect to the mail server before stopping. Try setting this
      value higher if your connection or server is slow.

</PRE></OL><h3>Check Inbox Assistant Configuration</h3>
 
<P>
Internet Mail includes an Inbox Assistant that can be configured to
automatically route messages to a different folder than the Inbox. Check
these settings to ensure messages are not being moved. For more
information about how to perform this task, consult Internet Mail
Help.
