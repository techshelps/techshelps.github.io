<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the Pingname.bat and Pingnum.bat files located in
the Windows\Help folder. These files are installed with Internet Explorer
version 3.0
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the Pingname.bat and Pingnum.bat files to help troubleshoot
Internet connection problems.
<P>
<P><h3>Pingname.bat</h3>
 
<P>
The Pingname.bat file contains the following lines:
<P>
<PRE>   ping www.microsoft.com

   ping ftp.microsoft.com

   @echo off

   echo ...

   echo Click the Help window to continue with the Internet troubleshooter.

</PRE>This file helps to test DNS (Domain Name System) connectivity issues.
Domain names make browsing easier, but the TCP/IP protocol uses only
numerical IP addresses. A DNS server resolves domain names to their IP
addresses. If you run the Pingname.bat file at a command prompt when you
have a valid connection, you should receive a reply similar to:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\WINDOWS\HELP&gt;ping www.microsoft.com

   Pinging www.microsoft.com [207.68.137.35] with 32 bytes of data

   Reply from 207.68.137.35: bytes=32 time=xxxms TTL=xxx

   C:\WINDOWS\HELP&gt;ping ftp.microsoft.com

   Pinging ftp.microsoft.com [198.105.232.1] with 32 bytes of data

   Reply from 198.105.232.1: bytes=32 time=xxxms TTL=xxx

</PRE>Note that although only one reply is listed here, a typical response
contains four replies.
<P>
The time and TTL values can vary. Receiving a "Bad IP Address" message can
indicate a DNS problem. Receiving a "Request Timed Out" message can also
indicate a DNS issue, as well as incorrect gateway information. It is
possible to receive one or two "Request Timed Out" messages and still have
a successful connection. Also, each batch file pings two values (either
DNS or IP addresses). This is a precaution in case one server is down.
<P>
<P><h3>Pingnum.bat</h3>
 
<P>
The Pingnum.bat file contains the following lines:
<P>
<PRE>   ping 198.105.232.1

   ping 198.105.232.6

   @echo off

   echo ...

   echo Click the Help window to continue with the Internet troubleshooter.

</PRE>Both addresses (198.105.232.1 and 198.105.232.6) are ftp.microsoft.com
servers. Both are tested as a precaution in case one is down.
<P>
If you run the Pingnum.bat file at a command prompt when you have a valid
connection, you should receive a reply similar to:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\WINDOWS\HELP&gt;ping 198.105.232.1

   Pinging 198.105.232.1 with 32 bytes of data

   Reply from 198.105.232.1: bytes=32 time=xxxms TTL=xxx

   C:\WINDOWS\HELP&gt;ping 198.105.232.6

   Pinging 198.105.232.6 with 32 bytes of data

   Reply from 198.105.232.6: bytes=32 time=xxxms TTL=xxx

</PRE>These batch files test the connection and its ability to browse, but do
not test the TCP/IP stack itself. If both of these tests fail, test the
TCP/IP stack by typing the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   ping 127.0.0.1

</PRE>You should receive the following reply:
<P>
<PRE>   Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time=xxxms TTL=xxx

</PRE>Any other reply can indicate a damaged stack. If this occurs, remove and
reinstall the TCP/IP protocol.
<P>

please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
