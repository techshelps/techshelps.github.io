<P><h2>INSTALLING SERVICE PACK 1 ON YOUR COMPUTER</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Window 95 Service Pack 1 floppy disk version is shipped in
compressed format. To extract the you must run Admin.bat.  Admin.bat is
located on Disk 3.
<P>
NOTE
- Do not run the individual "Diskx.exe" files, use the admin.bat file.
- Admin.doc, the Windows 95 Service Pack 1 Administrator Guide, is
<PRE>  located in the \Admin folder on Disk 2.

   1. Insert Disk 3 in your computer.

   2. Double-click Admin.bat to extract Windows 95 Service Pack 1 to
      your computer. By default Admin.bat will create a folder named
      C:\Sp1 and extract Service Pack 1 to this folder. Optionally you
      may specify the name of the folder that you would like to
      extract Service Pack 1.

   To change the default source and/or destination folders:

          Admin [x:\Srcdir] [y:\Destdir]

       examples:
          Admin a: c:\Temp\Sp1        ;from floppy to c: drive
          Admin . c:\Destdir          ;from current folder to
                                       c:\Destdir
          Admin g:\User\Mydir         ;from g: to current folder
          Admin g:\User\Mydir         ;from g: to c:\Sp1

   If the source folder is not specified, it will first look in the
   current folder. If the files are not found, it will then ask which
   floppy disk drive to try.

   To change the default installation folder from c:\Sp1 to another
   folder, you must also specify the source folder.  If you want to
   use the current directory for the source, but specify a custom
   destination folder, use "." for the source folder.
