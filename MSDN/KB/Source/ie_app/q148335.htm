<P><h2>OVERVIEW OF USING INTERNET MAIL</h2>
 
<P>
The Internet is a worldwide collection of thousands of interconnected
computers. You can use Internet Mail to communicate with anyone on the
Internet or any network with SMTP and POP3 services. With Internet Mail,
you can establish a connection to the Internet from your own personal
computer, and send and receive mail over the Internet using Microsoft
Exchange.
<P>
Tip
To view help for The Microsoft Network, click The Microsoft Network Help
Topics from the Help menu in Microsoft Exchange.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET USING A MODEM</h2>
 
<P>
To connect to the Internet using a modem, you ll need TCP/IP on your
computer, Internet Mail, Dial-up Networking (installed during Microsoft
Windows 95 Setup or through Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel), and an
Internet service provider that supports PPP, SMTP, and POP3. Internet Mail
receives mail from POP3 servers and sends mail using SMTP, so be sure that
the Internet provider supplies these services.
<P>
Local and regional providers can provide the connection for you, and the
phone call charge is usually at local prices. If there aren't any local
services, check for providers with direct-dial long distance charges. Check
your local listings, trade magazines, or a local computer store for
Internet providers.
<P>
Note
You also have the capability of using SLIP with Internet Mail.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET USING A LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN)</h2>
 
<P>
To connect to the Internet using a LAN, you'll need TCP/IP on your
computer, Internet Mail, a network adapter (installed during Microsoft
Windows 95 Setup or through Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel), and a
server that provides a connection to the Internet and supports TCP/IP,
SMTP, and POP3. For more information, see your mail administrator.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>USING INTERNET MAIL</h2>
 
<P>
Internet Mail can be added to an existing Microsoft Exchange profile or can
be used in a profile of its own. To create an Internet Mail profile, you
specify how your computer is connected to your Microsoft Exchange mailbox
and indicate your preferences for delivering and working with messages. If
you want to have more than one type of connection, you need to create a
profile for each type.
<P>
Your profile indicates how messages are delivered to and from your mailbox.
You can update your profile as needed, or when you are working with
Internet Mail, you can change the message settings for individual messages.
<P>
You can specify several transfer options. These include the type of message
format for outbound and inbound messages, the character set (depending on
the message format you use), and the method for transferring messages. You
can also choose to record session events in a log file.
