The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 for Macintosh
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to run a Java program in Internet Explorer, the Java
program may not run correctly, or may not run at all. This problem may
occurs even if Internet Explorer is properly configured to run Java
programs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can be caused by either of the following situations:

<UL><LI>The Java program you are attempting to run is failing byte code
   verification.

<LI>Your computer contains 8 MB of physical memory (RAM) and is low on
   system memory. Note that Internet Explorer requires at least 8 MB of
   physical RAM.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the appropriate method:
<P>
<P><h3>Java Program Failing Byte Code Verification</h3>
 
<P>
If you suspect the Java program is failing byte code verification,
follow these steps to work around the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Start Internet Explorer, and then click Preferences on the Edit
   menu.

<P><LI>Click the Web Content tab, click Don't Check Code in the Byte Code
   Verification box, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Clicking Don't Check Code prevents byte code verification from
being performed on Java programs that attempt to run on your computer,
allowing unverified programs to run. Before you allow an unverified
Java program to run on your computer, you should contact the
administrator of the Web site that contains the Java program to report
the problem, and inquire about additional workarounds that will allow
you to run the program.
<P>
<P><h3>Computer Contains 8 MB of RAM</h3>
 
<P>
If your computer contains 8 MB of physical RAM and is low on system
memory, quit any running programs that you are not currently using, or
remove or disable any unnecessary control panels and extensions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are three types of byte code verification that Internet Explorer
can be configured to use:

<UL><LI>Don't Check Code: Byte code located on your local hard disk and byte
   code obtained from a remote source, such as the Internet or a network
   drive, is not verified. Potentially harmful Java programs are allowed
   to run on your computer.

<LI>Check Remote Code: Byte code obtained from a remote source is
   verified, but byte code located on your local hard disk is not.

<LI>Check All Code: Byte code located on your local hard disk and byte
   code obtained from a remote source are both verified.
