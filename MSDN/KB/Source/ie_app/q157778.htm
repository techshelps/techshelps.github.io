<P><h3>INSTALLING MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installing from the Internet</h3>
 
<P>
To install Microsoft Internet Explorer from the Internet, carry out the
following procedure.

<OL><P><LI>Create a temporary directory on your computer.

<P><LI>Choose to download Microsoft Internet Explorer from the Internet, and
   save the file Dlfull.exe to the temporary directory.

<P><LI>In File Manager, run Dlfull.exe to extract the program files.

<P><LI>Read the instructions below for LAN installations and for installing
   with existing TCP/IP connections.

<P><LI>In File Manager, run Setup.exe. Setup installs files in the directory
   you specify.
<P>
   Note: If you are upgrading to a newer version of Internet Explorer and
   choose to install the program in a different directory from your
   original version, please refer to the following section, "Upgrading over
   Version 2.01," for further instructions.

<P><LI>If you want, you can delete the temporary directory you created.

<P><LI>Run Internet Explorer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Upgrading over Version 2.01</h3>
 
<P>
When upgrading to a newer version Internet Explorer, you can choose to
install the program into the same directory as your previous version or
establish another directory. If you choose the former, your previous dialer
settings and connection(s) will be preserved. However, if you choose the
latter, you must do the following in order to use your pre-existing dialer
settings and connection(s):

<OL><P><LI>If you install to a new directory, but keep your existing program group,
   you must change the properties of any dialer program item(s) you
   previously created so that the Command Line and Working Directory
   settings point to the appropriate directories. (Note that the New
   Connections program item does not need to be modified.) You do this by
   clicking the dialer program item, choosing Properties from the File
   menu, and replacing all references to the existing directory with the
   name of new directory. For example, if you install an upgrade of
   Internet Explorer to a new directory named NEWEXPL, the following change
   would be required:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Command Line: C:\IEXPLORE\iedial.exe C:\IEXPLORE\CON0000.CON
      Working Directory: C:\IEXPLORE
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Changes to:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Command Line: C:\NEWEXPL\iedial.exe C:\NEWEXPL\CON0000.CON
      Working Directory: C:\NEWEXPL
</PRE>
<P><LI>Using File Manager, copy all files with the extension .con from the
   previous directory to the new created directory.

<P><LI>If during the upgrade you choose to use a new program group, just follow
   step 2 and copy the old dialer program items to the new program group.
   Repeat step 1 to change the Command Line and Working Directory settings.
<P>
</OL>Upgrading over Version 1.5 and Version 1.6 Beta
If you are upgrading from the version 1.5 or version 1.6 beta, please read
the following special notes.

<UL><LI>The format of Iexplore.ini has changed, so Setup will make a backup copy
   of your current Iexplore.ini file to a file called Ie16ini.sav.
<LI>You will need to reapply any user-selectable settings, such as proxy
   servers, in the new version.
<LI>Your Favorites and History lists will be preserved.
<LI>Win32s is not required for this version, so if you installed Win32s
   specifically to run the version 1.6 beta, then you can remove it from
   your system. Please refer to the following URL for instructions on
   removing Win32s from your system:
<P>
<P><PRE>    <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/faq/devtools/winsdk/win32s/faq3476.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/faq/devtools/winsdk/win32s/faq3476.htm</A></B>
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>LAN Installations</h3>
 
<P>
If you already have access to the Internet through your LAN, you will be
able to use Microsoft Internet Explorer to browse the Internet. (If you are
not sure whether you currently have access, consult your network
administrator.)
<P>
If you have access, your LAN administrator should provide you with the
address of proxy servers that can be used.
<P>
To install Internet Explorer, you need to do the following:

<UL><LI>Make sure you have the TCP/IP protocol installed.
<LI>Run the installation in Custom mode, and make sure that the check box
   labaled TCP/IP Stack And Dialer is not selected.
<P>
</UL>Proxy servers can also be used, provided they are CERN compliant. To enable
use of a proxy server, choose Options from the View menu, and then on the
Proxy tab, type the address of your proxy server.
<P>
Note: When using Novell's NetWare IP stack with Internet Explorer, please
use the latest released version. Older versions of the NetWare stack may
not work properly.
<P>
<P><h3>Before Using the Mail Client</h3>
 
<P>
This software contains a mail client that will enable you to send, receive,
and store messages, provided that you have an e-mail account.
<P>
The first time you run Mail, it takes you through configuration steps that
are needed before you can use Mail. You will be able to use Mail only if
you complete these steps.
<P>
You will be prompted to enter the following configuration information:

<UL><LI>Names of network servers used to send and receive your mail (for
   example, POP3 server name and SMTP server name)
<LI>Mail protocols used to send and receive mail (such as SMTP, POP3)
<LI>Your login name and password on the server from which you retrieve
   e-mail
<LI>The network domain name or IP address of your computer
<LI>Your e-mail address
<P>
</UL>If you are not ready to enter this information, contact your system
administrator or your Internet service provider for assistance.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Third-Party Mail Clients</h3>
 
<P>
To use a MAPI compliant third-party mail client with Internet Explorer you
need to edit the Internet Explorer .ini file. To do this:

<UL><LI>Use Notepad to open the file IExplore.ini in your Windows directory.
<LI>Find the Mail section. (You can search for the text "[Mail]".)
<LI>Change the MyMailClient setting to 0.
<P>
</UL>When you're all finished, the Mail section should look like this:
<P>
<PRE>     [Mail]
     ; Set MyMailClient to 0 to use third party MAPI mail clients
     MyMailClient=0

</PRE></OL>Please note that Eudora is not MAPI compliant, and cannot be started by
Internet Explorer.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing a Modem</h3>
 
<P>
Please note that this version of the Dialer will support only COM modems.
This means that PCMCIA and other non-COM modems will not be supported. They
will be supported in future releases.
<P>
Before setting up, please make sure that your modem is turned on and
properly connected. Setup will try to detect and configure your modem. If a
modem is detected, but the exact type is unknown, select the modem manually
from the list of supported modems.
<P>
If a modem is not detected or you select the check box labeled Don't Detect
My Modem, you may select the modem manually.  However, the default maximum
speed will be 9600 baud. Therefore, you should manually select a speed that
matches your modem's capabilities in order to optimize the performance of
the modem.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Dialer</h3>
 
<P>
This release of Internet Explorer also supports dialer scripts.
IEscript.exe is located in the directory where you installed this Internet
Explorer. The program allows you to associate a script with a connection.
To start the program, choose Run from the File menu in Program Manager.
<P>
Also, please refer to the Script.wri file for more discussion regarding how
to use scripting.
<P>
In order to use the dialer with a PBX that does not have a dial tone, you
need to modify the DialString in the "Dial-In Configuration" section of the
Shivappp.ini file in order to dial. For example, the X3 command would be
inserted between the "AT" and "D" entries as follows:
<P>
<PRE>  [Dial-In Configuration]
  DialString=ATX3D

</PRE>Note that adding the X3 command affects all locations and only functions
properly with Hayes-compatible modems.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Third-Party Telnet Helper Applications</h3>
 
<P>
To configure Internet Explorer to use a Telnet helper application, open
Iexplore.ini and locate the [Helpers] section. Remove the semicolon from in
front of the telnet= line, and type the path to the telnet application. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>  [helpers]
  telnet=c:\windows\telnet.exe %s

</PRE><h3>Installation with Existing TCP/IP Connections and ISP Accounts</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Internet Explorer has been installed and tested with several of
the most popular Internet access products available today. If it is
configured properly, you should be able to use the TCP/IP protocol and
dialer (via Winsock.dll) provided with these products to connect with your
Internet service provider (ISP). It is not necessary to install the Dialer
and TCP/IP stack that are provided with Internet Explorer.
<P>
In general, all that is required is that you configure the PATH command in
your Autoexec.bat file so that Internet Explorer can find the Winsock.dll
file you are using to connect to the Internet. For example, if your
Winsock.dll file is in the directory C:\Connect, add a line directly under
your current PATH command that reads:
<P>
<PRE>  PATH=%PATH%;C:\CONNECT

</PRE>If you have multiple Winsock.dll files, please make sure that the Winsock
file you choose to use comes first in the PATH command or is located in the
directory where your browser files reside.
<P>
Following are procedures for installing Microsoft Internet Explorer over
some common Internet access products. Other packages available include FTP
Software, Network TeleSystems, and shareware from Trumpet Software
(<B><A HREF="http://www.trumpet.com.au/wsk/winsock.htm)">http://www.trumpet.com.au/wsk/winsock.htm).</A></B>
<P>
<P><h3>Internet Chameleon 4.5</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Install Microsoft Internet Explorer to the suggested default directory
   (C:\Iexplore).

<P><LI>Make sure that the Internet Chameleon directory is in your path. If it
   is not, add it to the PATH statement in your Autoexec.bat file, and then
   restart your computer.

<P><LI>Run the Internet Chameleon dialer program (from the Custom icon).

<P><LI>Select the line corresponding to your current Internet service provider,
   and make sure that the Dial On Demand command on the Setup menu has a
   check mark by it. This makes the dialer program run when Internet
   Explorer tries to connect to the Internet.

<P><LI>Start Internet Explorer by double-clicking the Internet Explorer icon in
   the Microsoft Internet Explorer group in Program Manager.
<P>
</OL>If you have configured the Chameleon dialer to dial on demand, an Internet
connection is made when you first enter an Internet address in Internet
Explorer.
<P>
If you have not configured the Chameleon dialer to dial on demand, you need
to start that program before you start Internet Explorer.
<P>
<P><h3>Netscape Navigator 1.2 Personal Edition</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Install Microsoft Internet Explorer to the directory that contains your
   Netscape Navigator files. For example, if you installed the Netscape
   browser in the default directory (C:\Netscape), place the Microsoft
   Internet Explorer files in the same location.

<P><LI>Run Internet Explorer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Other Internet Dialer Packages</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Using the Custom setup option, install Microsoft Internet Explorer to
   the suggested default directory without the TCP/IP stack and dialer.

<P><LI>Make sure that the Internet dialer directory is in your path. If it is
   not, add it to the PATH statement in your Autoexec.bat file, and then
   restart your computer.

<P><LI>Run your existing Internet dialer program.

<P><LI>Choose to enable dial on demand (if your dialer supports this option).
   This makes the dialer program run when Internet Explorer tries to
   connect to the Internet.

<P><LI>Start Internet Explorer by double-clicking the Internet Explorer icon in
   the Microsoft Internet Explorer group in Program Manager.
<P>
</OL>If you have configured the dialer to dial on demand, an Internet connection
is made when you first enter an Internet address in Internet Explorer.
<P>
If you have not configured the dialer to dial on demand, you need to start
that program before you start Internet Explorer.
<P>
<P><h3>Making a Backup Copy of the Software</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Make sure that you have three disks (3.5" disks with 1.44 MB capacity).
<P>
</OL>2  After you have downloaded the software and have run Dlfull.exe (see
<PRE>   "Installing from the Internet" section earlier in this file) your
   temporary directory contains all the files that you need to make disks.

</PRE><P><LI>Copy the file Iew31_3.cab on your disk number 3.

<P><LI>Copy the file Iew31_2.cab on your disk number 2.

<P><LI>Copy the following files on your disk number 1.
<P>
<P><PRE>     Files.inf
     Readme.txt
     Iew31_1.cab
     Setup.exe
     Install.lst
     License.txt
     Install.bin
</PRE><P>
</OL> 
<P><h3>KNOWN ISSUES AND BUGS</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE> * No inline video.
 * No Internet shortcuts.
 * Does not work with Windows NT Challenge Response Authentication in
   Microsoft Internet Information Server. To work around this, make sure
   the Allow Anonymous option is enabled in the WWW Service Properties
   dialog box in Internet Information Server.
 * You cannot open another instance of Internet Explorer by double-clicking
   an .htm file in File Manager or double-clicking the Internet Explorer
   icon in Program Manager. To open a new instance of Internet Explorer,
   choose New Window from the File menu.
 * If you have voice messages waiting on your phone line (rapid beeps), our
   Dialer fails to dial out on the line. This can be remedied (for Hayes-
   compatible modems only) if, in the file Modems2.ini, at the end of the
   line for the InitString setting, you set "blind dialing" by typing:
    S6=5
 * When checking for or sending mail with the Mail program, you need to
   wait a few minutes before closing the Mail program to make sure it has
   completed the transfer.
 * Internet Explorer might have difficulty loading a very large number of
   newsgroups (&gt;16000). If your news server has a large number of
   newsgroups, you should use a dedicated newsreader to browse the groups.
 * If you are creating a new connection and try to cancel that connection
   part of the way through the creation process, the file that represents
   the new connection is still created. If you try to use that connection
   name again, the following message appears:

        The entry name is invalid. It is already in use.

   If you want to use that specific connection name, you need to find the
   .con file that was created for that connection and delete it from your
   hard disk.
