Problems Resolving E-Mail Addresses
-----------------------------------

<P>
E-Mail Address Not Resolved:
<P>
If the addressee's e-mail address is not resolved when you click Send or 
Check Names in a new message, you may not be set up to resolve addresses 
against a Directory Service. To resolve e-mail addresses against a 
Directory Service, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Internet Mail, click Address Book on the File menu.

<P><LI>In Windows Address Book, click Directory Services on the File menu. 

<P><LI>On the General tab, click the Directory Service you want to use for
   resolving addresses, and then click Properties.

<P><LI>On the General tab of the Directory Service's properties, click the
   "Check names against this server when sending mail" check box to
   select it. 

<P><LI>Click OK, and then click OK again.

<P><LI>Close the Windows Address Book. 

<P><LI>In Internet Mail, click New Message, and then type the addressee's e-
   mail address in the "To:" box. 

<P><LI>On the Mail menu, click Check Names to resolve the e-mail address.
<P>
</OL>E-Mail Address Resolved Incorrectly:
<P>
If an incorrect name is returned when an e-mail address is resolved, there 
may be a problem with the order in which Windows Address Book checks the 
Directory Services. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Internet Mail, click Address Book on the File menu.

<P><LI>In Windows Address Book, click Directory Services on the File menu. 

<P><LI>On the Options tab, verify that the order in which the Directory
   Services are selected is correct.

<P><LI>If the order is incorrect, click the Directory Service you want to move
   and then click Move Up or Move Down to organize the Directory Services
   in the correct order.
<P>
</OL>If the Directory Services are in the correct order, you may be resolving 
the e-mail address against your local Windows Address Book file (.wab). To 
determine if this is the case, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Internet Mail, click Address Book on the File menu.

<P><LI>Check if there is an address book entry for the person who you are
   trying to send e-mail to.

<P><LI>If there is an address book entry for the person who you are trying to
   send e-mail to, double-click the address book entry.

<P><LI>Type the correct e-mail address in the E-Mail Addresses box, and then
   click Add.

<P><LI>Click the e-mail address you added in step 4, and then click Set As
   Default.
<P>
   NOTE: If the correct e-mail address is already listed, set it as the
   default address.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
