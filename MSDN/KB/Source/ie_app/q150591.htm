The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0, 2.1, 3.0 for Macintosh
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists steps you can use to troubleshoot Setup problems you
may experience when you install Internet Explorer for Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Eudora Light</h3>
 
<P>
Eudora Light 1.5.4 is provided as-is with Internet Explorer 2.0 and 2.1
and is not supported by Microsoft.
<P>
<P><h3>Disable Control Panels, Extensions, and Startup Items</h3>
 
<P>
Control Panels, extensions, and items in your Startup Items folder (such
as anti-virus software) may prevent Internet Explorer for Macintosh
from installing properly. To disable these items, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Press and hold down SHIFT while your computer starts.
<P>
   NOTE: You should receive a message stating that the extensions are
   disabled or off.

<P><LI>In the Finder, select and delete the Internet Explorer for Macintosh
   files and run the Installer again.
<P>
   To completely remove all the files that were copied to your hard disk
   during the installation of Internet Explorer, use one of the methods in
   the appropriate section.
<P>
   Removing Internet Explorer 2.0 or 2.1:
<P>
   To completely remove Internet Explorer 2.0 or 2.1 from your hard disk,
   follow these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Delete the following folders, if they exist:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>        - Internet Explorer for Macintosh
        - System Folder:Preferences:Explorer

    b. Delete the following files, if they exist:

       - System Folder:Extensions:Intel Raw Video
       - System Folder:Extensions:Indeo Video

   Removing Internet Explorer 3.0:

   To completely remove Internet Explorer 3.0 from your hard disk,
   follow these steps:

    a. Delete the following folders, if they exist:

        - Microsoft Internet Applications
        - My Personal Web Site
        - System Folder:Preferences:Explorer
        - System Folder:Java
        - System Folder:MS Internet

    b. Delete the following files, if they exist:

        - System Folder:Extensions:Intel Raw Video
        - System Folder:Extensions:Indeo Video
        - System Folder:Extensions:Microsoft PWS Extension
        - System Folder:Extensions:MS IE ActiveX Lib (PPC)
        - System Folder:Extensions:MS Internet Library (PPC)
        - System Folder:Extensions:Jgdw.ppc
        - System Folder:Preferences:Internet Preferences

      NOTE: The System Folder:Preferences:Internet Preferences file is
      also used by Internet Config, and may contain preferences that are
      used by other Internet programs (mail programs, news readers, File
      Transfer Protocol programs, and so on). Do not delete this file
      unless you are sure you have written down all of the settings.

</PRE></OL><h3>Check for Viruses and Hard Disk Integrity</h3>
 
<P>
File system damage and viruses can prevent the installation of Internet
Explorer for Macintosh. Use Disk First Aid (or a similar disk
maintenance tool such as Norton Disk Doctor or MacTools) to verify the
integrity of your hard disk. In addition, scan your hard disk with an
anti-virus tool to make sure your computer is not infected with a virus.
<P>
<P><h3>Turn Off or Unplug External SCSI Devices</h3>
 
<P>
An incorrectly terminated small computer system interface (SCSI) chain may
cause programs to stop responding (hang), random error messages to appear,
or the system to indiscriminately crash and restart. To troubleshoot the
possibility that the SCSI chain is incorrectly terminated, turn off or
unplug external devices that are connected to the SCSI chain on your
Macintosh.
<P>
Other reasons SCSI devices may not work or the chain may be unstable
include:

<UL><LI>One or more of the devices in the chain is not turned on.

<LI>Two or more of the devices have the same ID number.

<LI>The chain is improperly terminated.

<LI>The total chain (cable length) is too long (over 20 feet).

<LI>A driver is incompatible with the current operating system.

<LI>A device or another part of the chain is damaged in some way.
<P>
</UL>Because SCSI device drivers are loaded into memory when the Macintosh is
turned on, they can generate conflicts similar to extension conflicts. When
you are using a non-Apple formatting tool, contact the tool's manufacturer
for compatibility information. Removing internal SCSI devices is best
performed by an Apple-authorized service provider.
<P>
<P><h3>Install by Using a Different Copy of the Installer</h3>
 
<P>
When you downloaded Internet Explorer for Macintosh, the BinHex file
may have been damaged due to line noise, electronic interference, or
problems with the modem. Download the file again and run the Installer
again.
<P>
<P><h3>Rebuild the Desktop File</h3>
 
<P>
A damaged Desktop file is usually indicated by generic icons in the Finder
(desktop) and the inability to start programs. You can rebuild the Desktop
file by pressing and holding down COMMAND+OPTION while restarting the
computer. Note that rebuilding the Desktop file may purge inactive files
and links but leave the damaged set of files. Tools are available from
online sources that force the Macintosh to re-create a Desktop file series
by deleting them entirely.
<P>
<P><h3>Reinstall the System Software</h3>
 
<P>
Reinstall the system software only if you continue to have problems
installing Internet Explorer for Macintosh. When you are prompted
whether to update the current system folder or to perform a clean install
into a new folder, choose to perform a clean install. If this procedure is
not followed, the Setup program simply updates the currently active system
folder, which retains the damaged files or settings.
<P>
For information about reinstalling the system software, see the Macintosh
system documentation or other printed information included with your
computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Zap the Parameter RAM (PRAM)</h3>
 
<P>
Zapping the Parameter random access memory (PRAM) is one technique for
solving various system and program problems on a Macintosh. In some cases,
the PRAM may need to be zapped several times. Please note that performing
this procedure resets only the first 64 bytes of 256 bytes in the PRAM.
programs are available from online sources that completely resets the PRAM.
<P>
For more information about zapping the PRAM, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
