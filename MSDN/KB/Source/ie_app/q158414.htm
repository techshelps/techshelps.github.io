The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Personal Web Server versions 1.0, 1.0a for Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Personal Web Server version 1.0 for Windows 95
in Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) by adding the appropriate
network service, ""Program Files\Personal Web Server"" and "Webshare"
folders are created. However, when you install Personal Web Server in OSR2
from an online service (such as the Microsoft <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/</A></B>
Web site), a "Program Files\Websvr" folder is created instead of a
""Program Files\Personal Web Server"" folder.
<P>
In addition, if you install Personal Web Server by adding the appropriate
network service and then install it from an online service, the Program
Files\Personal Web Server folder may remain on your hard disk even though
it is not being used by Personal Web Server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The "Program Files\Personal Web Server" folder was changed to Program
Files\Websvr in the version of Personal Web Server currently available on
online services to prevent problems that might occur when you attempt to
use Universal Resource Locator (URL) addresses that contain long folder
names. The "Program Files\Personal Web Server" folder is not removed when
you install Personal Web Server from an online service to prevent removing
any data files that you created after you originally installed Personal Web
Server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the "Program Files\Personal Web Server" folder remains on your hard disk
after you install Personal Web Server from an online service, the existence
of the folder should not cause any problems. If you want to delete the
folder to create more free space on your hard disk, you should manually
move any data files that you created after you originally installed
Personal Web Server from the "Program Files\Personal Web Server" folder to
the Program Files\Websvr before you delete the folder.
<P>
NOTE: The files and folders in the "Program Files\Personal Web Server"
folder that were created by Personal Web Server when you originally
installed it do not need to be manually moved to the Program Files\Websvr
folder.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To determine which version of Personal Web Server is currently installed,
use My Computer or Windows Explorer to locate the Inetsw95.exe file, right-
click the file, click Properties on the menu that appears, and then click
the Version tab. If the File Version line indicates that the file is
version 4.70.1055, the version of Personal Web Server included with OSR2 is
installed. If the File Version line indicates that the file is version
4.70.1181, the version of Personal Web Server available on online services
is installed.
<P>
NOTE: If you installed Personal Web Server by adding the appropriate
network service and then installed it from an online service, you may have
two Inetsw95.exe files on your computer. If one of the files is version
4.70.1181, the version of Personal Web Server available on online services
is installed.
