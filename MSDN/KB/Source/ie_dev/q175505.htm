The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer (Programming), versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to download a .cab file to using the CODEBASE tag on a Web
page in Internet Explorer (IE) 3.x, a dialog box appears that asks you to
specify the location of a file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This can occur for one of two reasons.

<UL><LI>The .inf file marked read-only inside the .cab file.

<LI>You are downloading to a Windows 95 platform and the .cab file contains
   an .inf file that was created for use with a Setup application. These
   Setup applications are typically run from a setup disk or CD-ROM.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Set the .inf file for read-write access and re-cab the file using
Cabarc.exe. See Solution 1 below for more information.
<P>
-or-
<P>
Rewrite the .inf file with code download syntax. See Solution 2 below for
more information.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Solution 1</h3>
 
<P>
To set your .inf file for read-write access, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Go to a Command prompt

<P><LI>Create a new directory. Copy your .cab file into this new directory.

<P><LI>Use the CABARC utility to extract the files from the .cab file. The
   CABARC utility is included in CABSDK. The CABSDK is included with the
   ActiveX SDK and the Internet Client SDK. If you are using Internet
   Explorer 3.x, use the CABARC utility that is included with the ActiveX
   SDK. If you are using Internet Explorer 4.x, use the CABARC utility that
   is included with the Internet Client SDK.
<P>
   For example, if your .cab file was named Yourcab.cab, use the following
   command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cabarc X yourcab.cab
</PRE><P>
   This will extract the contents of the .cab file to the current
   directory.

<P><LI>Remove the Read-only attribute from your .inf file using the following
   command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      attrib -r *.*
</PRE>
<P><LI>Re-create the .cab file using this command-line string:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cabarc -s 6144 N yourinf.inf yourfiles
</PRE><P>
   where yourfiles are all the files other than the .inf file that were
   extracted from the .cab file in step 3.
<P>
</OL><h3>Solution 2</h3>
 
<P>
To determine if the .inf file in your .cab file was created for use in a
setup application, search for the phrase "Add.Code". If this phrase is not
present in the .inf file, then the file was not built for use in a setup
application.
<P>
For information about building an .inf file in the code download format,
please refer to the Internet Client SDK documentation regarding the
packaging of ActiveX controls in the following chapter: Component
Development\ActiveX Controls\Packaging ActiveX Controls.
<P>
If you are packaging an ActiveX control that was created using Visual
Basic, use the Application Setup Wizard and choose the "Create Internet
Download Setup" option.
