The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer (Programming), version 3.02, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When downloading a signed self-extracting executable that worked fine in
Internet Explorer 3.01, the following message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   A Windows application is attempting to open or install the following
   software component:

   SomeFile.exe

   Please be aware that some files may contain viruses or otherwise harm
   your computer.  This component has not been digitally "signed" by it's
   publisher.  Do you wish to continue?

</PRE>This self-extracting executable was packaged using a product from a third-
party vendor such as InstallShield's PackageForTheWeb or Nico Mak's WinZip.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This message may be displayed when downloading a properly signed self-
extracting executable file in Internet Explorer version 3.02. This is a
result of a security fix made to Internet Explorer 3.02.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If your code is not affected by this fix, you need not take any action.
<P>
If you currently sign self-extracting executables packaged with products
from InstallShield or Nico Mak Computing, you will need to do the
following.

<OL><P><LI>Download an updated version of their products, available today, from
   their Web sites. Please see <B><A HREF="http://www.installshield.com/pftw">http://www.installshield.com/pftw</A></B> and
   <B><A HREF="http://www.winzip.com/wzse.htm">http://www.winzip.com/wzse.htm,</A></B> respectively, for more information about
   InstallShield and Nico Mak’s updated products.

<P><LI>Repackage your self-extracting executable using these updated products.

<P><LI>Re-sign your self-extracting executable using your current certificate
   and the current code signing tools, which are available in the ActiveX
   SDK at <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/sbnmember/download/download.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/sbnmember/download/download.asp</A></B>
<P>
</OL>If you currently package your executable using another vendor’s product,
please notify us through safecode@microsoft.com.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>What code is affected?</h3>
 
<P>
This fix applies only to signed self-extracting executables created with
tools from vendors such as InstallShield (PackageForTheWeb) and Nico Mak
Computing (WinZip). Microsoft has worked with these vendors to make updated
versions of their tools available.
<P>
<P><h3>What code is not affected?</h3>
 
<P>
No other types of signed code are affected. Self-extracting executables
created with the Wise Installation System from GLBS are unaffected by this
fix.
<P>
<P><h3>More details</h3>
 
<P>
The intent of this fix is to keep Internet Explorer and Microsoft
Authenticode(TM) Technology a highly secure platform for executing
downloaded code. When verifying the digital signature for signed self-
extracting executables, previous versions of Internet Explorer did not take
into consideration data that was referred to in the executables created by
some vendors.
<P>
To address this potential problem, Internet Explorer 3.02 will not
recognize the digital signature in the signed self-extracting executables
described above, regardless of the browser's Safety Level. When a user
downloads these signed self-extracting executables, Internet Explorer 3.02
will now bring up the "Potential Safety Warning" dialog box and treat the
signed self-extractable executable as unsigned code.
