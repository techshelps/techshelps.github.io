The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer (Programming), versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Because some scripts may take an excessive amount of time to run, Internet
Explorer 4.0 (IE4) prompts the user to decide whether they would like to
continue running the slow script. Some tests and benchmarks may use scripts
that take a long time to run and may want to increase the amount of time
before the message box appears. In IE4, the script timeout value can be
changed on specific client machines by modifying a registry entry.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are situations when a Web page contains script that takes an
unusually long time to run.  If you are scripting an ActiveX control on a
Web page to transfer a very large file or do a large database query, this
will often cause a significantly long delay. IE3.02 detects the long delay
and prompts the user with a dialog box reading the following:
<P>
<PRE>   This page contains a script which is taking an unusually long time to
   finish. To end this script now, click Cancel.

</PRE>The equivalent message box for IE4 reads:
<P>
<PRE>   A script on this page is causing Internet Explorer to run slowly. If
   it continues to run, your computer may become unresponsive. Do you want
   to abort the script?"

</PRE>This mechanism allows the user to stop misbehaved script that runs into an
endless loop or otherwise is performing slowly.
<P>
In IE3.02, this message box can appear on machines running Windows 95. The
IE3.02 browser is specifically looking to see if the script thread has
pumped any windows messages in the last five seconds. There is no way to
override this timeout period for IE3.02. If you are using an ActiveX
control with long blocking operations, that ActiveX control should either
employ an event mechanism and return control to the caller or call
PeekMessage every five seconds to reset the timeout.
<P>
As of Internet Explorer 4.0, the timeout is no longer a fixed value based
on Windows messages. IE4 now tracks the total number of executed script
statements for the current page with the script engine and throws up the
timeout dialog box when that value hits a threshold amount.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
To change this timeout value in IE4.0, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Using a REGISTRY EDITOR such as Regedt32.exe, open this key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\InternetExplorer\Styles
</PRE>
<P><LI>Create a new DWORD value called "MaxScriptStatements" under this key
   and set the value to the desired number of script statements.
<P>
</OL>By default the key doesn't exist. If the key has not been added, IE4
defaults to 5,000,000 statements executed as the trigger for the timeout
dialog box.
<P>
Because the IE4 timeout is based on the number of script statements
executed, the timeout dialog box will not display during ActiveX control or
database-access delays. Endless loops in script will still be detected.
