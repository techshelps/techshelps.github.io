<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When creating a database Stored Procedure in an ODBC Script File window via
the ODBC Script File dialog box (from the File menu, select New and click
the File tab), the ODBC Script File dialog box does not act like a Stored
Procedure Editor dialog box. It allows a save of the Stored Procedure only
once, failing on any successive attempts to save the Stored Procedure.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Visual InterDev does not parse any commands in the ODBC Script File window
to see if they are Stored Procedures, Triggers, or Views. It treats them
like regular ODBC commands and does no special work to ensure that they run
properly. However, the Stored Procedure Editor ensures that a stored
procedure saves without encountering the error saying that the Stored
Procedure already exists in the database.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, right-click on the Database Connection node in
the Data View tab of the Workspace window, and click Refresh. Expand the
connection node to see the Stored Procedures folder. Expand that folder.
Double-click the Stored Procedure created in the ODBC Script File window to
edit it.
<P>
NOTE: Another workaround is to create the Stored Procedure by selecting
Data View, right-clicking the Stored Procedures folder, selecting New
Stored Procedure, then Write Procedure. Right-click in the window and
select Run. Right-click and select Run again. No error appears.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
bug and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Stored Procedures are saved to a database by executing the text of the
Stored Procedure as if it were an ODBC command. They are "run" by executing
the name of the Stored Procedure and adding any parameters ("call
&lt;procedure name&gt;").
<P>
ODBC Script commands are saved to local storage, not in a database. ODBC
Scripts are "run" by simply executing the commands they contain.
<P>
Saving a Stored Procedure requires work to remove the existing Stored
Procedure before the updated one is saved. Visual InterDev does this work
when a Stored Procedure is saved from within the Stored Procedure Editor.
It does no special work when an ODBC Script is run, and so the second time
a Stored Procedure inside an ODBC Script is run fails because the Stored
Procedure already exists in the database.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a database project or add a data connection to a Web project.

<P><LI>Click the Data View tab in the Workspace window.

<P><LI>Select the data connection to which to add a Stored Procedure in the
   Data View window.

<P><LI>From the File menu, select New. Click ODBC Script File.

<P><LI>Enter the text "Create Procedure MyProc as return" in the ODBC Script
   window (without the quotes).

<P><LI>Right-click in the window and select Run.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Repeating step 6 fails at this point.

<OL><P><LI>Right-click on the data connection node of the Workspace Window and
   select Refresh.

<P><LI>Expand the data connection node.

<P><LI>Expand the Stored Procedures folder.

<P><LI>Double-click the new Stored Procedure node to open it for editing.
