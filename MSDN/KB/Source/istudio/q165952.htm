<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual InterDev, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Changes are made to .asp files and saved via Visual InterDev (VID), but
when previewed with a browser the changes are not seen.
<P>
This issue applies to developers making changes to the Global.asa and other
.asp files
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Changing and then saving the Global.asa causes Active Server Pages (ASP) to
miss any changes made to other .asp files afterward. This is an
architecture problem of Active Server Pages 1.0.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are a couple of workarounds. The guaranteed way is to stop and re-
start the Web server through the Internet Information Server (IIS) manager.
Another way that should work for most cases is to preview one of the .asp
files in a browser, then to make trivial changes to all of the affected
files and save them again. Note that you could reproduce the same problem
if you save the Global.asa again.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by an architecture problem with Active Server Pages
1.0. For performance reasons, ASP caches a copy of each Web site's .asp
files. To allow VID and FrontPage to properly update and save files, ASP
monitors the file structure of the Web site, typically stored under
"\InetPub\wwwroot," and updates its cached versions when any changes are
made. If someone changes the Global.asa, however, then this mechanism does
not work again until the Global.asa has been executed, which is done
whenever one of the .asp files is viewed.
<P>
Any changes made to .asp files between the saving of the Global.asa and its
execution simply does not show up, and IIS executes and runs the contents
of the old .asp file. Stopping and re-starting the Web server through the
IIS manager causes ASP to reload the files and pick up any changes. Also,
executing the Global.asa re-starts the notification mechanism so that if
the files are saved again, they are properly updated in the ASP cache.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Make changes and save the Global.asa.

<P><LI>Make changes to an .asp file and save.

<P><LI>Preview the .asp file in the browser, the changes made in step 2 do
   not appear.
