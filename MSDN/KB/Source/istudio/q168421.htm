<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Visual InterDev contains wizards for the generation of sample
Active Server Pages (ASP).  These pages serve as an example of the
capabilities of Visual InterDev and Active Server Pages.  Microsoft
Technical Support does not provide support for changes made to these pages.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Using the Data Form Wizard in Visual InterDev you can create a form based
upon a data source. When completed you will have three ASP documents in the
form of the following:
<P>
<PRE>   xxxxAction.asp
   xxxxForm.asp
   xxxxList.asp

</PRE>Where xxxx is the file name provided to the wizard when you select it from
the File menu, New option.
<P>
Microsoft Technical Support (MTS) can help troubleshoot problems in the
default code created by the Data Form wizard. If any alterations are made
to the code, the code is no longer considered Wizard code. Instead it is
now considered "user code," and MTS will be unable to assist in
troubleshooting.
<P>
For assistance from MTS, problems will need to be isolated from Wizard code
and duplicated in a simple example. MTS can help resolve issues with these
simple examples.
<P>
<P><h3>Document Information</h3>
 
<P>
xxxxAction.asp:
<P>
The xxxxAction.asp file is responsible for reacting to user interaction
with either the xxxxList.asp or the xxxxForm.asp files.  It consists of
several functions defined within the &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags at the beginning of the
.asp file. When the file is called, it looks to see what button was
pressed, and reacts accordingly. After performing some action, it redirects
the browser to either the xxxForm.asp or the xxxxList.asp files.
<P>
xxxxForm.asp:
<P>
The xxxxForm.asp file is called initially and displays a single record from
the database table or recordset. It consists of four major sections. The
first section sequentially is the various VBScript functions called by the
form. The most important of which is the ShowFields function which is
responsible for taking a field name, and showing it in the HTML document.
The second major section is an ActiveX design-time control, the Data Range
Header. The data range header is followed by some more VBScript code that
calls the ShowFields function for each field in the recordset. Finally
another ActiveX design-time control is used. This is the Data Range Footer.
This simply acts as the end of a loop established by the Data Range Header.
<P>
xxxxList.asp:
<P>
The xxxxList.asp file is very similar to the xxxxForm.asp file. It contains
the same sections in the same order with one exception. This file displays
multiple records at a time in a list format within an HTML table. Before
the Data Range header Design-time control is the &lt;TABLE&gt; tag and the column
headings.
