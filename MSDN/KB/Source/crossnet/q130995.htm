The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to connect over an existing Remote Access Service (RAS) link
to a remote resource you have access rights to, one of the following
messages appears after you enter the correct password (your RAS connection
remains unaffected):

<UL><LI>From File Manager:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Stop. Access is denied.
</PRE>
<LI>From MS-DOS Command Prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      System error 1326 has occurred.
      Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.
</PRE><P>
</UL>These symptoms occur after you call a RAS server from your RAS client and
the RAS server authenticates you successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Your local logon credentials differ from the remote domain credentials.
<P>
The RAS server does not log you on to the remote domain with your user
account, password, and domain credentials you enter in the RAS
Authentication dialog box. It only uses these credentials to verify that
you have permission to physically access the network as a dial-in client.
To validate your access to protected resources on the remote domain, the
remote domain controller checks the credentials you entered when you first
logged on locally, not the RAS Authentication dialog box credentials you
entered just before calling the RAS server.
<P>
Therefore, if your local logon credentials differ from the remote domain
credentials, you cannot access protected resources on the remote domain and
one of the messages above appears.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of these three solutions to gain access to your remote resources:

<UL><LI>Log on to the remote domain after you establish the RAS connection.
<LI>Automatically log on remotely at Windows NT startup (before RAS link).
<LI>Supply your remote credentials each time you connect to a remote share.
<P>
</UL>These solutions are explained below. They assume that the administrator of
the remote domain has previously granted you access rights to the share you
are trying to connect to.
<P>
<P><h3>Log On to the Remote Domain After You Establish the RAS Connection</h3>
 
<P>
Log off your local domain and log on to the remote domain by pressing
CTRL+ALT+DEL.
<P>
For this to work, the following actions must occur:

<UL><LI>The administrator of the remote domain needs to create a domain account
   for your computer.

<LI>Your computer needs to join the remote domain. For instructions on how
   to join a remote domain over a RAS link, please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q125856.htm">Q125856</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Joining a Domain from a Windows NT Workstation Running
                  RAS

</PRE></UL>NOTE: If the symptoms still occur, and you are sure you are supplying the
correct credentials, check with your network administrator to see whether
you have access permissions to the remote share.
<P>
<P><h3>Automatically Log on Remotely at Windows NT Startup (Before RAS Link)</h3>
 
<P>
You can avoid logging off and on again after each RAS connection. To do
this, you need to follow the requirements in the above section titled "Log
On to the Remote Domain After You Establish the RAS Connection." Then do
one of the following:

<UL><LI>Use your remote domain credentials when you are logging on during
   startup of Windows NT even though the RAS connection does not exist yet.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>For completely transparent local and remote access, make your local
   user account, password, and domain name credentials the same as your
   remote domain credentials.
<P>
   NOTE: Making the local domain name identical to the remote domain name
   is a security issue and may require reinstallation of Windows NT,
   depending on which version of Windows NT you are running. Check with
   your administrator regarding the security issue. Consult your Windows NT
   documentation regarding changing your domain name.
<P>
</UL>For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : RAS: Use Cached Credentials to Log On to a Different Domain

</PRE><h3>Supply Your Remote Credentials Each Time You Connect to a Remote Share</h3>
 
<P>
If your computer is not part of the remote domain, or if you do not want to
log on to the remote domain by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL, use one of the
following procedures to gain access to your remote resources. Depending on
which of your remote credentials differ from your local credentials, one of
the following solutions applies.
<P>
When Only Your Passwords Differ:
<P>
<PRE>   If only your passwords differ, enter your password for the remote domain
   when you are prompted for it.

   NOTE: If the symptoms still occur, but your passwords are the same on
   both domains, then you or your system logon cache must have supplied a
   different user name or domain name. For more information on supplying
   the correct credentials, read the information below.

</PRE>When Using File Manager and Your Domain Names or User Names Differ:
<P>
<PRE>   Supply your remote domain credentials in the Connect As field in the
   File Manager Connect Network Drive dialog box. If your local domain name
   is different than the remote domain name, enter your credentials as
   follows:

      &lt;remote_domain_name&gt;\&lt;remote_user_name&gt;

   NOTE: If the remote domain name and local domain name are identical,
   then enter only your remote user name.

</PRE>When Using the NET USE Command:
<P>
<PRE>   Supply your remote domain credentials with the /USER command switch of
   the NET USE command. For example:

      NET USE R: \\Finance\Data /USER:Corporate\FredMgr

   where Corporate is the remote domain name and FredMgr is the remote
   user name.
