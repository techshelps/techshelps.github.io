MS-DOS, VERSION 2.2C (BASIC AND ENHANCED CLIENTS)
 
<P>
<P><h3>Identical TCP/IP on Both Clients</h3>
 
<P>
Identical TCP/IP protocols ship with both MS-DOS-based clients. These
MS-DOS-based clients support:

<UL><LI>An MS-DOS-based interface.
<LI>Domain Name Resolver (DNR) (to resolve hostname-to-IP address
   mappings) if your network has a domain name server (DNS).
<LI>For Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) clients.
<LI>WINS resolution.
<LI>Windows Sockets.
<P>
</UL>These MS-DOS-based clients do not support following features that are
provided by TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 and Windows
NT version 3.5:

<UL><LI>Support for DNS resolution using WINS.
<LI>Support for WINS resolution using DNS.
<LI>Name registration with the WINS database. (MS-DOS-based computers are
   clients, not servers, and do not generally need registration.)
<LI>Ability to act as a WINS proxy node.
<LI>Multihomed support.
<LI>Support for Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP).
<LI>DHCP command-line switches for IPCONFIG.EXE (use the DHCP
   Administration utility instead). Specifically, IPCONFIG.EXE does not
   support the following switches, which are available in the IPCONFIG.EXE
   utilities for Windows for Workgroups and for Windows NT:
<P>
<P><PRE>      IPCONFIG /release
      IPCONFIG /renew
      IPCONFIG /?
      IPCONFIG /all
</PRE><P>
</UL>The MS-DOS TCP/IP client is available on the Windows NT Server CD and can
be download from:

</PRE>MICROSOFT LAN MANAGER FOR MS OS/2 CLIENTS TCP/IP
 
<P>
Microsoft LAN Manager for MS OS/2 Client TCP/IP:

<UL><LI>Does not ship with Network File System (NFS) support. Third party
   applications such as Chameleon NFS from Netmanage and NFS from FTP
   Software Incorporated provide this functionality.

<LI>Does not ship with line printer daemon (LPD) support. Third-party
   vendors provide this support.

<LI>Does not support DHCP or WINS.

<LI>Can only be bound to one network card.

<LI>Supports Token Ring source routing over TCP/IP.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: You cannot connect to a network drive from an MS-DOS session nor
from Windows running under OS/2. You must make the connection using the
LAN Manager Net interface or using the NET USE command at an OS/2 command
prompt. The redirected drive letter is then available when you switch to
an MS-DOS or Windows session.
<P>
Microsoft LAN Manager for MS OS/2 Client is available on the Windows NT
Server CD.

   Generator, Daytime, Discard, Echo, and Quote of the Day. These
   protocols allow a Windows NT computer to respond to requests from other
   systems that support these protocols.
<P>
</UL><h2>GENERAL MICROSOFT TCP/IP QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. What is the Windows Sockets standard?

   A. The Windows Sockets standard is an open interface for network
      programming under Microsoft Windows. Some of the companies
      originally involved in writing the specification were JSB
      Corporation, FTP Software Inc., Sun Microsystems, and Microsoft
      Corp.

      On the Internet it can be found by using anonymous FTP to
      VAX.FTP.COM or FTP.UU.NET. You can also use the archie service on
      the Internet to find the one closest to you. You can request
      information by sending email to: winsock@ftp.com.

2. Q. What is the difference between a Windows NT domain and a Domain Name
      Server (DNS) domain?

   A. A Windows NT domain is a collection of computers that share a common
      user account database and security policy. A DNS domain is used by
      computers on the Internet. It is typically used for distributing a
      host file across a network. However, it can also be used to
      distribute any form of information.

3. Q. What is the differences between WINS and DNS?

   A. The Domain Name System (DNS) proxy agent in the Windows NT version
      3.5x Resource Kit improves the integration of Dynamic Host
      Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Windows Internet Name Service
      (WINS). DHCP is a protocol for automatic TCP/IP configuration that
      provides static and dynamic address allocation and management. WINS
      is a name resolution service that resolves Windows networking
      computer names to IP addresses in a routed environment. DNS requires
      static configuration for computer name-to-IP address mapping, while
      WINS is fully dynamic and requires far less administration.
