The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you dial in from Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Remote Access Services
(RAS) client to a RAS server, the following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   NETBIOS error 640: a netbios error has occurred (with failed code 0x5)

</PRE>NOTE: This problem may occur with some modems and not with others.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The "NETBIOS error 640" message can be caused by the following conditions:

<UL><LI>The connection speed is too fast for the current line quality.

<LI>The correct modem has not been selected from the Configuration menu.

<LI>The cable being used does not support all the pinouts needed for RAS.

<LI>Your modem is not fully compatible with the Microsoft RAS compression.

<LI>You are loading PC Anywhere virtual device drivers (AW5VCD.386 and
   VPCAW5.386) from the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file. Comment
   out these drivers and add DEVICE=*VCD to the same section of the
   SYSTEM.INI file.

<LI>You logged on to the domain you are trying to connect to before
   connecting with RAS.

<LI>Microsoft LAN Manager OS/2 RAS server has NetBiosRetries set too high.

<LI>The Windows NT server is low on available memory.

<LI>There is an incompatibility with your third-party video driver.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you receive the "NETBIOS error 640" message several seconds after
connecting to the RAS server, use the following procedure to determine what
is causing the error. After each step, try to establish a RAS connection.

<OL><P><LI>Choose Setup and ensure RAS is configured for the correct modem.

<P><LI>Make sure you are using the correct cabling. For more information, run
   RAS and check online Help.

<P><LI>Make sure you are not logged on to the domain you are trying to connect
   to before connecting with RAS.

<P><LI>Make sure you are not using a 9-to-25-pin converter that was supplied
   with a mouse. Many 9-to-25-pin converters supplied with mouse hardware
   do not carry modem signals.

<P><LI>Disable hardware flow control and lower the connection speed as follows:
<P>
   a. Edit the RAS phone book and select Modem from the Advanced options.
<P>
   b. Clear the Enable Hardware Flow Control check box.
<P>
   c. Change the connection speed to the lowest setting.
<P>
   If the connection is successful, try increasing the connection
   speed until the maximum throughput of the line is found.

<P><LI>If RAS software compression is enabled, disable it.

<P><LI>Try using the standard Windows for Workgroups VGA video driver.

<P><LI>If you are trying to connect to a Microsoft LAN Manager OS/2 RAS server,
   make sure NetBiosRetries is not set too high. For example, some
   Microsoft customers have reported this problem when NetBiosRetries is
   set to 6. To correct this problem, lower the LAN Manager server
   NetBiosRetries value in the [NetBEUI] section of the PROTOCOL.INI file.

<P><LI>If you are trying to connect to a Microsoft Windows NT server, make as
   much memory available as possible on the server.
