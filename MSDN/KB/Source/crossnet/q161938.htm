The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51 and 4.0
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51 and 4.0
- Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Exchange clients experience slow logons or the inability to log on during
peak logon hours due to a deadlock in LSASS. The following errors occur in
the event log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID 7200 - MSExchangeIS Private
   Background thread FDoMaintenance halted due to error code 4015.

</PRE>-or-
<P>
<PRE>   Background thread FDoQuotaCheck halted due to error code 4015.

</PRE>Additionally, the thread counts for Dsamain.exe on the Exchange Server
computer and Lsass.exe on the resource domain controllers increase rapidly.
If the Exchange Server computer is a domain controller, then thread counts
for both DSAMAIN and LSASS will increase on the Exchange Server computer.
Normally the thread counts for DSAMAIN and LSASS are under 30 for most
servers. Thread counts for LSASS and DSAMAIN will rapidly climb to over 70
threads during the time when clients are experiencing the slow logons
associated with this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem only occurs when Exchange Server computers are located in a
resource domain and the Windows NT user accounts exist in a trusted domain.
<P>
Every Exchange client logon causes the Exchange Server computer to look up
the account security identifier (SID) in the user accounts domain. When an
Exchange client logs on, it sends a NspiBind request to the Exchange Server
computer. This results in a LookupAccountSid() call within LSASS on the
domain controller in the resource domain being sent to one of the trusted
domain controllers in the user accounts domain. When this occurs, one
thread enters a critical section, giving it exclusive access to the code
that allows it to acquire a lock to a protected resource. The resource in
this case is a particular work queue of LookupAccountSid() operations to be
performed.
<P>
After acquiring the lock, Windows NT performs a calculation to determine
whether it needs to spawn more LookupWorker threads. If Windows NT needs
more threads, it does more calculations, releases the lock, creates
threads, and does the lookups. If not, Windows NT performs the
LookupAccountSid within this thread itself. The only problem is that
Windows NT continues to hold the lock unnecessarily. The deadlock occurs
because the other threads are waiting to acquire the lock to access the
work queue. The fix is to release the lock after the initial calculation,
when Windows NT determines additional LookupWorker threads are not needed.
<P>
The fix has to be applied to all resource domain controllers when the user
accounts exist in a trusted domain.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions
3.51.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
This fix is now available in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT only runs into the problem when the user accounts for Exchange
exist in a trusted domain. In this case, there is a call to look up the SID
in a trusted domain, which is the only code path to the bug that caused the
deadlock situation. The search premise is based on pass-through
authentication. To understand it better, follow this simplified version of
what happens with respect to an Exchange Server computer being in a
resource domain. There are two possible scenarios, both similar. The first
scenario occurs when the Exchange Server computer is not a domain
controller. The second scenario occurs when the Exchange Server computer is
a domain controller.

<UL><LI>Scenario 1: Exchange Server computer is not a domain controller:
<P>
</UL>The Exchange Server computer first attempts to look up the account SID in
its local accounts database. It does not find the SID, so it sends the
request to a domain controller in its primary domain (the domain it is a
member of). The domain controller in the primary domain attempts to locate
the SID in its SAM by calling a routine to look up the SID in the local
domain. If it still cannot find the SID, which will be the case when the
user accounts are in a trusted domain, then it sends the request to a
trusted domain controller in the user accounts domain. The domain
controller calls a routine to look up the SID in a trusted domain, which
results in the bug. The congestion is on the resource domain controller.

<UL><LI>Scenario 2: Exchange Server computer is a domain controller:
<P>
</UL>The Exchange Server computer is a domain controller, so it attempts to find
the SID in its copy of the SAM by calling a routine to look up the SID in
the local domain. If it still cannot find the SID, which will be the case
when the user accounts are in a trusted domain, it sends the request to a
trusted domain controller in the user accounts domain. The resource domain
controller/Exchange Server computer calls a routine to look up the SID in a
trusted domain, which results in the bug. The congestion is at the Exchange
Server computer, because it is a domain controller.
