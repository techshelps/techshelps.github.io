The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SQL Server versions 4.21, 6.0, and 6.5
<LI>Win32 Named Pipes
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run SQL Server applications on a computer running Windows
95, you may experience slow connections to Microsoft SQL Server using named
pipes. This applies to both ODBC and DB-Library applications. The same
applications will run normally on a computer running Windows NT, or using
other interprocess communication (IPC) connections, such as TCP/IP sockets
or SPX. 
<P>
Also when reading data from a named pipe when the client is on Windows 95,
calls to blocking ReadFile will not return immediately when there is no
data present. When there is data present, a blocking read may take up to
1 second per message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by Windows 95 NWLink Direct-Hosting, which was
implemented to enhance the general network performance of Windows 95. A
client using Direct-Hosting may experience a delay in reading from named
pipes.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do any of the following:

<UL><LI>Use other IPCs, such as TCP/IP sockets. Because Windows 95 supports many
   protocols (such as TCP/IP and NWLink IPX/SPX), you can easily configure
   your clients to use these alternative IPCs for SQL Server connections.
   For information on how to configure your clients to use other IPCs,
   consult SQL Server Books Online.

<LI>Disable the Direct-Hosting feature for client computers running Windows
   95. To do this, run the Regedit.exe program on the client computer
   running Windows 95, and navigate to the following registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\VNETSUP
</PRE><P>
   Add a string value named DirectHost and set the string value to 0
   (zero). Also, ensure that NetBIOS support is enabled for NWLink, if
   NWLink is the only transport protocol loaded on the client computer
   running Windows 95.

<LI>Remove the NWLink protocol from the client computer running Windows 95.
   Unless you need to access NetWare servers, you don't have to load NWLink
   on the clients. Instead, use TCP/IP and/or NetBEUI, both of which also
   support named pipes.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Direct-Hosting is enabled by default, so you may run into this problem if
you have NWLink installed and configured as the default transport protocol.
However, if you have other transport protocols loaded at the same time, you
may not encounter this problem, because Windows 95 may use named pipes over
other protocols, rather than NWLink IPX/SPX.
<P>
This problem does not occur with 16-bit Windows applications, because the
16-bit named pipes Net-Library for Windows peeks the named pipes first
until data is available, and then begins to read. This method avoids the
delay with Direct-Hosting in its own Peeknamedpipe messages.
