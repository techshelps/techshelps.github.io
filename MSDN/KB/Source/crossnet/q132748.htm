95 3.51
WINDOWS
kbref
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Both Windows 95 and Windows NT Workstation 3.51 are designed to deliver a
common set of capabilities - great application support, ease of use,
connectivity, and manageability. Both products provide a platform for a new
generation of Win32-based applications that provide new features and
greater performance and reliability than today's Win16-based applications.
<P>
When choosing the right operating system to deploy for your corporation,
consider the needs of the users:

<UL><LI>Users doing mobile computing should use Windows 95 for the plug &amp; play,
   power management, and the Windows 95 Briefcase feature.
<LI>Developers, engineers, and other technical computer users, should
   choose Windows NT Workstation.
<P>
</UL>If you have the hardware to support Windows NT, and all your applications
and devices are supported, choose Windows NT Workstation. If you have older
hardware, older applications, and older devices, choose Windows 95.
<P>
You can plan for the future by making all new hardware purchases compatible
with Windows NT Workstation.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Mobile Users</h3>
 
<P>
Mobile computer users need integrated features, such as electronic mail,
fax, and remote networking, which ease information access from whatever
location. They need a high level of compatibility with their current
devices and applications, and an operating system which places moderate
demands on the system (RAM, disk space, battery power) and provides Plug
and Play device configuration capabilities. These users should use Windows
95.
<P>
<P><h3>Developers and Technical Users</h3>
 
<P>
Developers, engineers, scientific researchers, statisticians, and other
technical users often run processing-intensive applications, while also
using business productivity applications. Today, many of these users must
have both a UNIX-based workstation and a PC on their desk to get their job
done. Windows NT Workstation can save costs by meeting their demands for
greater processing power while also running Windows-based personal and
business productivity applications on the same system. Windows NT
Workstation provides the performance of a leading-edge workstation or mini-
computer at a fraction of the cost, with its support for symmetric
multiprocessing (SMP) and its portability to different high-performance
platforms like those based on Alpha AXP, PowerPC, or MIPS-based CPUs.
<P>
<P><h3>Business Desktop</h3>
 
<P>
For the business desktop, examine the business problem you're trying to
solve. To determine if Windows NT Workstation is compatible with your
existing hardware and software, answer the following three questions:
<P>
<PRE>   Do your current systems have the resources (minimum 12 MB RAM, 90 MB
   hard drive space) required to run Windows NT Workstation? If not, do
   you have the budget to upgrade these systems to run Windows NT
   Workstation? You should weight this cost against the extra reliability
   and protection features you get with Windows NT Workstation. If you can
   not afford to upgrade your systems today, you should deploy Windows 95.

   Are there Windows NT Workstation drivers for the devices you have in
   place, including video cards, drive controllers, proprietary 3270
   devices, and network interface cards? The Windows NT Hardware
   Compatibility List can be used to determine if drivers are available for
   these devices.

   Are your applications compatible with Windows NT Workstation? Are you
   running applications that require an MS-DOS or Windows device driver or
   SR, and have these been ported to Windows NT Workstation?

</PRE>If the answer to each of the above questions is yes, then you should deploy
Windows NT Workstation. In the areas that require the higher level of
compatibility, you should deploy Windows 95.
<P>
Do you need the additional application and system protection features
offered by Windows NT Workstation?
<P>
In some situations, the business cost from a disruption in service caused
by an application bringing down another application or the system can be
very high. Windows NT Workstation can help minimize these costs by running
Win16 applications in separate address space (often referred to as separate
virtual machines) so that if one Win16 application fails, all of the other
applications will continue to run. Win32-based applications running on both
platforms provide greater reliability through use of separate memory
address areas, multiple asynchronous message queues, and structured
exception handling. Windows NT provides an additional level of protection
for the system by completely separating operating system and application
code. Windows NT Workstation can also be configured to automatically
restart if the system goes down. If the value of these additional
protection features offered by Windows NT Workstation is greater than the
value of the higher level of compatibility offered by Windows 95, choose
Windows NT Workstation.
<P>
Do you require the data security features offered by Windows NT
Workstation?
<P>
Both Windows 95 and Windows NT Workstation can help prevent naive users
from damaging their system configuration. Beyond this, the Windows NT File
System (NTFS) can be configured to restrict access to systems and data.
This prevents malicious users from deleting system files or damaging line-
of-business applications. With these features, a Windows NT desktop system
can even be shared by multiple users and still maintain security for all
files on the system. In addition, Windows NT Workstation is currently in
the evaluation phase for the government C2 level security specification. If
the value of these additional security features offered by Windows NT
Workstation is greater than the value of the higher level of compatibility
offered by Windows 95, choose Windows NT Workstation.
<P>
Overall, Windows 95 is the best choice where you need to leverage your
investment in your existing infrastructure by using your existing
applications and devices as you make a steady transition to Win32-based
applications and more capable hardware. In other cases where the highest
levels of protection for applications, system and data are required to meet
your business needs, Windows NT Workstation is the best choice.

<P>
</UL>NOTE: Windows NT Workstation requires 12 MB RAM 486 or greater, or
compatible RISC-based system. Also, certain categories of applications that
try to directly access hardware will not work on Windows NT Workstation
because they compromise security or system robustness (for example,
applications that try to directly access hardware, some MS-DOS games
requiring specialized hardware access, and old MS-DOS and Windows device
drivers [including VxDs]).
