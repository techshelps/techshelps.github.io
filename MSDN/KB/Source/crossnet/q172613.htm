<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to connect to a Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS)
server, you may experience one of the following problems:
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking (DUN) Client</h3>
 
<P>
You may be prompted to change your password and/or you may receive the
following error:
<P>
<PRE>   The computer you have dialed in to has denied access because the
   username and/or password is invalid on the domain.

</PRE><h3>Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS Client</h3>
 
<P>
You may receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Error 649: The Account does not have Remote Access permission.

</PRE>The above problems only occur if all of the following conditions are met:

<UL><LI>Your Windows NT domain account is configured to expire passwords or you
   enable the Change Password at Next Logon option in User Manager for
   Domains.

<LI>The RAS Server is running Windows NT configured as a member server and
   is participating in a domain.

<LI>Your user account is not in the RAS server's local user account security
   (SAM) database, but only in the domain database.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, you will need to use one of the following methods,
depending on the version of Windows NT Server that is operating as your RAS
server:
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT Server 3.51</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If you want to expire passwords or use the Change Password at Next Logon
   option, you will need to move your RAS server to a Windows NT computer
   that is configured as a domain controller.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Do not use password expirations.
<P>
</UL><h3>Windows NT Server 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
Obtain the following fix or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.
<P>
This fix should have the following timestamp:
<P>
<PRE>   04/07/97  04:02 PM                49,936 Raspppen.dll (Intel)
   06/30/97  09:20 PM                28,432 Rassauth.dll (Intel)

-or-

   04/07/97  03:13 PM                81,680 Raspppen.dll (Alpha)
   06/26/97  08:00 PM                53,008 Rassauth.dll (Alpha)

</PRE>NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to Windows NT 4.0 prior to applying
this fix.
<P>
