The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article was created in close collaboration between Microsoft and
Security Dynamics, Inc. It explains how to install the various ACM models
made by Security Dynamics with Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.1 and 3.5
and how to configure the Remote Access Service (RAS) clients that are going
to call the RAS server with the ACM device. This article does not explain
how to program the ACM devices themselves; please refer to the ACM
documentation for that information.
<P>
The primary purpose of the ACM products is to give additional security to
the already very secure Windows NT operating system. Windows NT provides
two levels of security for RAS users. First, users need to be in the
domain's user accounts database as valid users. Secondly, users need to be
granted Remote Access permissions by their administrator in order to be
successfully authenticated by a RAS server.
<P>
For Microsoft Windows NT customers with higher security needs, Security
Dynamics adds a third level of security by requiring users to identify
themselves to the server's ACM device with a password that dynamically
changes every 30 seconds in a credit card-sized device that the users carry
with them. The ACM device on the Windows NT RAS server is plugged in-line
between the modems and the server's serial ports. If the user's password
doesn't match, the user will be disconnected from the modem without ever
interacting with Windows NT RAS.
<P>
The ACM devices work with both Windows NT workstations and Windows NT
servers, but because Windows NT workstations allow only one incoming call
at a time, the ACM devices are used more frequently with Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1, which allows up to 64 simultaneous
connections, and Windows NT Server version 3.5, which allows up to 256
simultaneous connections.
<P>

<UL><LI>ACM/1600 hardware running software version 4.08-5 or later
   -or-
   ACM/400 hardware running software version 1.08-5 or later
   -or-
   ACM/100 hardware running software version 1.12A or later

<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server software version 3.1 or later
   -or-
   Microsoft Windows NT (to host single session)

<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server Remote Access Service
   software (RAS) for Windows NT version 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups
   version 3.11.
<P>
</UL>ACM Host and Modem adapters may be needed, depending on the model and
hardware version of your ACM. Refer to Table 1 later in this document to
determine your requirements.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Windows NT Server Configuration</h3>
 
<P>
The MODEM.INF file supplied with the NT server software contains an entry
for SDI's ACM/400 hardware product. The section is labeled [SD ACM400 w/
AT&amp;T 3820]. This entry is designed for use with an AT&amp;T Comsphere 3820
modem.
<P>
If you want to use a different modem with your ACM device, the macro
definitions, such as &lt;speaker_on&gt;=M1, and the COMMAND_INIT= lines must be
changed to comply with the modems to be used with the ACM hardware.
(Although the section heading refers to the ACM/400 product, it can be used
for ACM/100 and ACM/1600 devices as well.)
<P>
The easiest way to customize the ACM entry for your particular modem is to
locate, within the MODEM.INF file, the section that refers to your modem
type, and copy and paste that section to the end of the MODEM.INF file.
Rename the section heading to reflect the ACM and modem type you're using.
The length of the section heading must be limited to 31 or fewer
characters, excluding the brackets.
<P>
If there is no entry for your specific modem, try to select from the list
of supported modems a model that matches yours as closely as possible. Make
your choice by comparing entries in the MODEM.INF file with commands for
your modem. Refer to your modem's documentation for a description of your
modem's commands. The documentation may also list compatible modems or
models that it can emulate. After you have selected the appropriate modem
and copied its settings to the end of the MODEM.INF file, rename the
section heading to reflect the ACM and modem type you're using. Again, do
not exceed 31 characters, excluding the brackets. (For more information on
making an unsupported modem work with RAS, refer to the RAS client software
Help file section titled "Modifying MODEM.INF.") Once that has been done,
adjust the following settings :

<OL><P><LI>Set the MAXCONNECTBPS parameter in the new [SD ACM] section of the
   MODEM.INF file to equal the highest speed that is compatible with the
   ACM hardware and modem being used. This will usually be 38400 or 19200
   baud. For higher baud rates, consult Security Dynamics product support
   first.

<P><LI>Set Hardware Flow Control to ON (this is the default value). For
   assistance, refer to "Setting Modem Features" in the RAS Help file.
<P>
</OL>For more information regarding the MODEM.INF file, refer to your Microsoft
Windows NT Advanced Server Remote Access Service manual.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft RAS Terminal Configuration</h3>
 
<P>
To prepare the client for Terminal mode:

<OL><P><LI>Access the Remote Access Phone Book, and select the entry you want to
   connect to.

<P><LI>Choose Edit.

<P><LI>If the word "Advanced" appears in the button below the Cancel button,
   choose the Advanced button; otherwise, proceed with step 4.

<P><LI>If you are using a Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 or Windows NT
   version 3.1 client, choose the Switch button. If you are using a Windows
   NT version 3.5 client, choose the Security button.

<P><LI>If you are using a Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 or Windows NT
   version 3.1 client, select Terminal in the Post-connect Script field. If
   you are using a Windows NT version 3.5 client, select Terminal in the
   After Dialing field.

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>Connecting to the Remote Access server:

<OL><P><LI>In the Remote Access Phone Book, select the entry you want to connect
   to.

<P><LI>Choose Dial. When prompted, type your user name, password, and domain
   name, and then choose OK.

<P><LI>Type your PIN and CARDCODE in the Enter PASSCODE field of the Terminal
   screen, and then press ENTER.
<P>
   The ACM will indicate that your PASSCODE has been accepted when the
   cursor drops down to the next line on the Terminal screen. If a
   connection message has been defined within the ACM, then it will be
   displayed.

<P><LI>Choose Done.
<P>
</OL>Authentication on the Remote Access server will begin.
<P>
<P><h3>ACM Hardware Configuration</h3>
 
<P>
Channel Settings:
<P>
<PRE>   Baud Rate:     38.4k, 19.2k, 9600, 4800, 2400, 1200, or 300.
      Configure the ACM channel baud rate to match the MAXCONNECTBPS
      parameter in the Windows NT server MODEM.INF file's [SD ACM400]
      section. This would normally be 19200 or 38400 baud.

   Data Bits:     7 or 8 to match NT Server   (default=8)

   Stop Bits:     No setting required

   Parity:        None, Even, Odd, Mark, or Space to match Windows NT
                  Server. (default=none)

   Protocol:     DCD at modem and DCD at Host. (d-d)  (default)

   Host Command Mode:  N  (default)

   Dialout:     Y (enabled)
      NOTE: For the dialout option to function properly, your ACM hardware
      may require Host and Modem adapters to be attached to each port of
      your ACM. Various revisions of the ACM hardware exist, requiring
      different models of these adapters. Refer to table 1 to determine
      your needs.

</PRE></OL><h3>Cabling Issues</h3>
 
<P>
In order for the ACM to function properly, it is very important that the
cables used to connect devices to the ACM hardware are properly configured.
The cables should include at least the following pins: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 20, and 22. The Dialout option, in particular, is reliant on pin 22
(Ring Indicator) to function properly. The cable connecting the modem to
the ACM's DTE port MUST support pin 22 or the Dialout function will not
operate properly. When the Ring Indicator connection protocol is selected,
the cable connecting the ACM on either the modem or host side of the ACM
will require pin 22, depending on the particular setting selected.
