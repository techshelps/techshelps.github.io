<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT will not have a problem handling the switch to the year 2000.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By virtue of its initial design, the Windows NT platform and all services
that ship with Windows NT such as CSNW or GSNW will not have the same sort
of trouble experienced by older mainframe applications.  When using the
NTFS file system, which uses a 64-bit time-stamp, the Windows NT platform
is "aware" of many centuries into the future. The time-stamp on FAT file
systems is good until 2108. IS organizations that implemented IBM (and
other) mainframe-based applications are concerned as many of these older
applications were not written to be year-2000 aware. For a year-stamp, they
only enter the last two digits of the year, for example, 1977 would be
entered as 77. This means that if a "00" is entered, there is no way to
tell which century it is. Applications designed in Microsoft SQL Server,
Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, and so on, should not have this type of
trouble as they all include a date field that goes beyond just two digits.
