<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 and 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Macintosh allows files to be saved without extensions. When a Windows 95
client examines the file with Explorer, the files will appear as the
default document icon with the Windows logo.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT provides a method to add extensions to file names in an orderly
fashion for any program that requires an extension. The method can be
broken down into the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On a Windows NT Server running Services for Macintosh "SFM" create a
   Macintosh volume for each of the extensions needed.  For example, if
   your converting Excel, Word, and PowerPoint files, create new folders
   for each of these programs in the Windows NT Macintosh volume.

<P><LI>Copy all the files to their respective volume share on the Windows NT
   Server.

<P><LI>Go to a Windows NT command prompt, then go to the Microsoft Word
   directory and type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren *.* *.doc
</PRE>
<P><LI>Switch to the Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint directories and do the
   same, typing:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren *.* *.xls
      ren *.* *.ppt
</PRE>
<P><LI>Examine the files using Windows 95 Explorer and you will see that the
   files now have the correct icon and can be easily opened with Explorer
   and the parent application.
<P>
</OL>There are three consideration to take into account with this process.  The
first limitation is that Windows 95 is not Unicode aware. While Macintosh
clients can save files with file names such as 2/6/96, Windows 95 programs
will be unable to open or rename these files.  To correct this problem,
rename them from a Macintosh client or from Windows NT server.
<P>
The second consideration is the current file name length. If by adding the
".doc" extension, the Macintosh file name exceeds 31 characters, the file
name will be converted on the Macintosh side to an MS-DOS short name.
However, you will still be able to see all the characters from Office 95.
Thus, if you had a Macintosh file named: "Spooky Kitty lost his Katnip," it
would get renamed to "Spooky Kitty lost his Katnip.doc." And because this
causes the file name to exceed 31 characters, SFM would display it to
Macintosh users as "Spooky~1.DOC." This display issue comes from a
Macintosh limitation, which states that the file names cannot be longer
than 31 characters.
<P>
Finally, when the Macintosh file contains several periods in the name, The
process above will place the extension after the first period.  For
example, if the Macintosh saved the file as  "Spooky.Kitty.likes.Katnip,"
when the conversion process is completed the file while be renamed
"Spooky.Doc."
