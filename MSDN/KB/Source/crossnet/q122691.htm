The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0 and 3.1
<LI>Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The WinPopUp service behaves differently in versions of LAN Manager later
than version 2.0b than in versions 2.0b and earlier. You may prefer the
earlier WinPopUp implementation. This article describes the behavior
differences and how to change WinPopUp on Windows/LAN Manager clients.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In LAN Manager versions 2.0b and earlier, a WinPopUp dialog box appears on
your screen that requires you to either choose OK to read the message or
Cancel to ignore the message.
<P>
In LAN Manager versions later than 2.0b, the WinPopUp icon changes from a
"hiding" jack-in-the-box to a jack-in-the-box that has sprung up from the
box when a message arrives. You then double-click the icon to view and
respond to the message.
<P>
You may prefer the earlier method of handling incoming messages if you want
to ensure that users see messages, such as important messages from network
administrators, immediately.
<P>
If you have a version of LAN Manager later than 2.0b but you want WinPopUp
to handle incoming messages the way LAN Manager version 2.0b and earlier
handled them:
<P>
NOTE: You need a copy of the WINPOPUP.EXE file from LAN Manager version
2.0b or earlier to complete this procedure.

<OL><P><LI>Exit WinPopUp if you are currently running it.

<P><LI>Rename WINPOPUP.EXE and WINPOPUP.HLP in the LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG (or
   equivalent) directory.

<P><LI>Copy the earlier version of WINPOPUP.EXE into that directory.

<P><LI>Start the earlier version of WinPopUp. You can do this by using the Run
   option in the File menu of Program Manager or File Manager, by double-
   clicking the file in the File Manager directory window, or by exiting
   and restarting Windows if WinPopUp is configured to start automatically
   at startup.
<P>
</OL>The WinPopUp dialog box now appears on your screen when you receive
WinPopUp messages; to close the dialog box, you must choose either OK or
Cancel. Also, the jack-in-the-box icon now appears as monochrome (black-and-
white) instead of color.
