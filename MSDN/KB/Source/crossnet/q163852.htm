The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When an Intel processor receives a specific invalid instruction, your
computer may stop responding (hang). Your computer must be turned off and
restarted to return to normal operation.
<P>
NOTE: Although there is no known operating system or application that
issues such an invalid instruction, you should be aware that a program can
be written maliciously to contain such an instruction. The operating system
would not trap this error, as it should, which results in the processor
hang.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur due to an error in the following Intel processors:

<UL><LI>Pentium processor
<LI>Pentium processor with MMX technology
<LI>Pentium OverDrive processor
<LI>Pentium OverDrive processors with MMX technology
<P>
</UL>NOTE: This problem cannot occur on the following Intel processors:

<UL><LI>Pentium Pro processor
<LI>Pentium II processor
<LI>i486 and earlier processors
<P>
</UL>This problem is known as "Invalid Operand with Locked CMPXCHG8B
Instruction" and is erratum 81 on the Pentium processor errata list. For
more information, please contact Intel or go to the following Intel web
site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B>http://support.intel.com/sites/support/</B>

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Intel has identified a workaround to this problem that allows the operating
system to trap the invalid instruction and not pass it to the processor.
Microsoft has worked closely with Intel to provide the following hotfixes:
