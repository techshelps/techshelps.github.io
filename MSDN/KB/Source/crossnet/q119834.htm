The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Windows for Workgroups over Microsoft LAN Manager, Setup
assumes you are upgrading your network operating system. It assumes that
you will not be using LAN Manager as your network, but will instead be
using the Microsoft Windows Network, or one of the other supported networks
listed during installation.
<P>
This article describes how to configure your workstation to use Windows for
Workgroups with LAN Manager as the only network operating system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Windows for Workgroups on top of LAN Manager and select
"No Windows support for networks," the following error message may appear
when you start Windows:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find a device file that may be needed to run Windows.

   Make sure that the PATH line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file points to the
   directory that contains the file and that it exists on your hard disk.
   If the file does not exist, try running Setup to install it or remove
   any referenced to it from your SYSTEM.INI file.
   ee16.386 (This line varies, depending on your network card.)

</PRE>The AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, and SYSTEM.INI files need to be modified to
make Windows for Workgroups function properly with LAN Manager.
<P>
Setup saved your old CONFIG.SYS file as CONFIG.OLD and your old
AUTOEXEC.BAT file as AUTOEXEC.OLD. Copy the lines specific to LAN Manager
from the .OLD files and combine them with the lines needed for Windows.
<P>
NOTE: If you had an existing AUTOEXEC.OLD or CONFIG.OLD, it will rename the
files CONFIG.001 and AUTOEXEC.001
<P>
Example AUTOEXEC.BAT for Windows for Workgroups with LAN Manager:
<P>
<PRE>   @ECHO OFF
   PROMPT $p$g
   C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE
   PATH C:\WINDOWS;C:\DOS
   SET TEMP=C:\DOS
   C:\DOS\DOSKEY
   @REM ==== LANMAN 2.2 === DO NOT MODIFY BETWEEN THESE LINES ===
   LANMAN 2.2 ====
   SET PATH=C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG;%PATH%
   NET START WORKSTATION
   LOAD NETBEUI
   @REM ==== LANMAN 2.2 === DO NOT MODIFY BETWEEN THESE LINES ===
   LANMAN 2.2 ====
   WIN

</PRE>Example CONFIG.SYS for Windows for Workgroups with LAN Manager:
<P>
(Notice that the line DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\IFSHLP.SYS has been removed that
Windows for Workgroups Setup usually inserts.)
<P>
<PRE>   DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
   DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS
   DOS=HIGH
   FILES=30
   SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS\  /p
   LASTDRIVE=Z
   STACKS=9,256
   DEVICE=C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTMAN\PROTMAN.DOS /i:C:\LANMAN.DOS
   DEVICE=C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\ETHERNET\EXP16\EXP16.DOS

</PRE>Delete the SYSTEM.INI in the Windows directory.
<P>
Modify the following lines:
<P>
<PRE>   [boot]
   network.drv=LANMAN21.DRV   (Add LANMAN21.DRV)
   [386Enh]
   netcard=                   (You may need to remove a reference
                               to the network card, such as ee16.386.)
   transport=                 (You may need to remove a reference
                               to the protocol used, such as netbeui.386.)

</PRE>The PROTOCOL.INI in the LANMAN.DOS directory should remain unchanged from a
regular LAN Manager workstation. The PROTOCOL.INI in the Windows directory
should contain only the following lines:
<P>
<PRE>   [network.setup]
   version=0x3110

</PRE>NOTE: If you plan on using WinPopup, make sure that you run WINPOPUP.EXE
from the LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG directory, not the one that may be in the
Windows directory.
