<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If your network consists of sites that are connected only when data on the
servers is replicated, then links created with the Paste Link command,
common to many OLE enabled applications, may fail.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a link to an object that is saved on a server, by default,
the link to that file is made using a Universal Naming Convention (UNC)
connection. The link does not show the redirected drive letter that you
have to the server's share, it simply shows the server and share
name. For example, if you connect to a server called AppServ, the share is
called Data, and the file is called MYDOC.DOC, then the UNC link to this
file would be \\APPSERV\DATA\MYDOC.DOC.
<P>
If the connections between all servers and client workstations are up and
working properly, you will not experience this problem. This is usually the
case for most networks. It is not usual for networks to be connected only
at certain times of the day, and instead, have the data replicated to
different sites.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Some applications will allow you to modify the link to refer to a
redirected drive letter that points to a local server that contains the
same file that is being referenced by the incorrect UNC path.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.1,
3.5, and 3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
