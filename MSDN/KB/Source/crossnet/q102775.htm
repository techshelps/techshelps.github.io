The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In some cases, you may have problems accessing Windows NT servers from
Windows for Workgroups (WfWG) computers. This article covers some of
the better known connectivity issues.
<P>
When you are using Workgroup Connections or Windows for Workgroups
network functions from MS-DOS, connecting to a computer with a space
in the computer name will result in a syntax error.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use quotation marks around the computer name and share name. This will
allow the connections. For example:
<P>
<PRE>  NET USE F: "\\Computer Name\share"

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Using Lowercase Extended Characters for Passwords</h3>
 
<P>
Lower level machines such as WFWG should not use lowercase extended
characters for passwords on Windows NT servers. By convention, the
down level client converts the password to uppercase before it is sent
to Windows NT. Some of the international characters do not have an
uppercase equivalent, which causes Windows NT to fail to validate the
password.
<P>
<P><h3>Using a Windows for Workgroups Machine as a Backup Browser</h3>
 
<P>
If Windows NT is the master browser and Windows for Workgroups is the
backup browser, you may get an empty browser list under the following
conditions:

<UL><LI>A user logs on to the Windows for Workgroups machine and does not
   have a valid username/password for the domain.

<LI>The Windows NT master browser goes down and promotes the Windows
   for Workgroups browser.
<P>
</UL>The Windows for Workgroups machine may have a empty browser list
caused by a failure to authenticate with the master before Windows for
Workgroups was promoted.
<P>
<P><h3>Using International Characters in the Windows NT Share Name</h3>
 
<P>
If you try to connect to a Windows NT share that contains one or more
international characters in the share name, you will receive an error
message.
<P>
<P><h3>Access Denied Errors</h3>
 
<P>
Windows for Workgroups does not send out domain information when:

<UL><LI>It attempts to log on to the Windows for Workgroups system

<LI>You issue a "NET USE" command for a Windows NT server causing a
   logon to an Windows NT system
<P>
</UL>This may cause access denied errors in the case where you have primary
accounts with different passwords in more than one trusted domain.
Your access to the server will depend on which trusted domain can
authenticate the users credential first.
<P>
<P><h3>Error 2242</h3>
 
<P>
A Windows for Workgroups computer may be unable to connect to a
Windows NT or Windows NT Advanced server computer, for the purposes of
sharing resources. When you try to connect, the Windows for Workgroups
computer generates the following error message: Error 2242.
<P>
Windows for Workgroups computers need accounts on Windows NT computers
to use shared resources on the Windows NT computers. Error 2242 is
generated if the given password on that account has expired. This
error can also be generated if the "User must change password on next
logon" box was checked when the account was created.
<P>
To correct this error use the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure the "User must change password on next logon" box is
   unchecked.

<P><LI>Type the user password for the Windows for Workgroups computer
   account.
<P></OL>
