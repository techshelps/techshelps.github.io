The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups versions 3.11, 3.11a,
   and 3.11b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use m-node TCP/IP-32bit Windows for Workgroups clients and your
primary WINS server is down, TCP/IP will fail to register all names with
the backup WINS server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When using m-node clients with TCP/IP, it will try to register names by
first using broadcasts. If broadcasts fail, it will try the primary WINS
server, and if this fails, it goes to the backup WINS server.
<P>
NetBIOS registration occurs during the startup of Windows for Workgroups.
It starts sending all registration requests to the backup after the other
two methods have failed. Because the secondary WINS server is up, it will
reply to the Name Registration request. The Name Registration request code
sees a response and acts accordingly. One of the things the Name
Registration request code does is check to see where the reply came from.
If it determines that the response came back from the backup, it will swap
the primary and secondary addresses so that it will now go to the backup.
<P>
Because it has not completed sending out all the Name Registers, it
continues sending the next Name Register to the backup server. Because the
Name Registration request code has swapped the backup and primary
addresses, it now sends to the primary again, and these names fail to get
registered.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for
Windows for Workgroups.  A fix to this problem is in development, but has
not been regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production
environments. Microsoft does not recommend implementing this fix at this
time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information on
the availability of this fix.
