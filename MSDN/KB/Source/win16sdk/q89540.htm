The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a critical error occurs on a system running Windows version 3.1,
Windows enters message mode and displays the blue full-screen window that
reports that an error has occurred. (This window is the window that
appears when CTRL+ALT+DEL is pressed.) When running Windows for Pen
Computing version 1.0 or 1.0a, the message window does not respond to
keyboard input. The system appears to hang for 15 seconds and then
returns to Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Under Windows for Pen Computing, the pen driver installs a hook so that
when the blue message window is displayed, the pen driver gets control.
This gives the pen driver the ability to simulate a key stroke into the
system thus preventing machines that don't have a keyboard from hanging
when the critical error message window is displayed. Unfortunately, the
pen driver's hook routine is intended only for machines that do not have
a keyboard attached. If a keyboard is attached, all keystroke information
is ignored for 15 seconds until the hook routine simulates the pressing of
the ENTER key. Thus, the system appears to hang for 15 seconds.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is aware of this problem and is making every effort to inform the
OEMs that are currently providing pen drivers about the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For a detailed description of the virtual pen driver and the Key_Hook_Proc,
see the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base titled "Understanding the
Windows Virtual Pen Driver." This article describes one possible workaround
that an OEM can use to work around this problem.
