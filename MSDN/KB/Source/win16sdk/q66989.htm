<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
KBHOOK is a file in the Software Library that contains sample code to
demonstrate the installation and use of a system-wide keyboard filter
function (otherwise known as a keyboard hook function). This code monitors
the status of the CAPS LOCK key. Whenever the CAPS LOCK key is pressed, its
status is displayed on the application's icon. Terminating the application
removes the keyboard filter from the system.
<P>
Download KBHOOK.EXE, a self-extracting file, from the Microsoft Software
Library (MSL) on the following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<P><PRE>      Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL
      Download <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/KBHOOK.EXE">KBHOOK.EXE</A> <I>(size: 22361 bytes)</I> 
</PRE>
<LI>Internet (anonymous FTP)
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
      Change to the \SOFTLIB\MSLFILES directory
      Get <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/KBHOOK.EXE">KBHOOK.EXE</A> <I>(size: 22361 bytes)</I> 
</PRE><P>
</UL>NOTE: The KBHOOK sample utilized the SetWindowsHook() function.
Applications written for Windows 3.1 should use the SetWindowsHookEx()
function.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
KBHOOK contains an application program, KEYAPP, and a dynamic-link library
(DLL), KEYHOOK, that implements the keyboard filter function.
<P>
KEYAPP calls KEYHOOK to install the keyboard filter function and then makes
itself iconic. Windows calls KEYHOOK each time a key is pressed. When the
CAPS LOCK key is pressed, KEYHOOK posts a message to KEYAPP. KEYAPP
processes the message by painting its icon to display the current state of
CAPS LOCK. When KEYAPP is terminated, the KEYHOOK filter is removed from
the system.
<P>
Because the keyboard filter function is called regardless of the
application that is currently active, the code must be in memory at all
times. When Windows 3.0 is running in real mode with extended memory, code
for inactive applications can be placed into extended memory banks that are
switched out of memory. Windows's memory management scheme is defined so
that code in fixed DLLs will remain in memory at all times and will remain
available for execution.
<P>
For more information on the keyboard filter function, see the documentation
for the SetWindowsHook() function on pages 4-419 through 4-427 in the
"Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit Reference Volume 1" for the
Windows SDK version 3.0. For additional information on the
SetWindowsHookEx() function see pages 896-899 of "Programmer's Reference,
Volume 2: Functions" from the Windows SDK version 3.1. The "Microsoft
Windows Software Development Kit Guide to Programming" provides additional
information on DLLs.
