The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
All Windows version 3.0 and 3.1 display drivers are required to contain
certain bitmaps. These bitmaps are used to paint various windows, controls,
and menus. Handles to these bitmaps can be retrieved with the LoadBitmap()
function. Below is an explanation of the OBM values listed in the Windows
include file WINDOWS.H.
<P>
These values are parsed by the C Compiler only if OEMRESOURCE is defined
prior to including WINDOWS.H.
<P>
Download SYSBIT.EXE, a self-extracting file, from the
Microsoft Software Library (MSL) on the following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<P><PRE>      Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL
      Download <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/SYSBIT.EXE">SYSBIT.EXE</A> <I>(size: 20442 bytes)</I> 
</PRE>
<LI>Internet (anonymous FTP)
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
      Change to the \SOFTLIB\MSLFILES directory
      Get <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/SYSBIT.EXE">SYSBIT.EXE</A> <I>(size: 20442 bytes)</I> 
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Because Windows buttons have two states, normal and depressed (the
mouse pointer is over the icon and the mouse button is down), the
first seven shapes (bitmaps) have two forms, the normal image and the
depressed image. Both images are used to create the illusion of three
dimensions on the screen when a button is pressed. The names of
depressed images end with the letter "D"; the other images do not.
<P>
The last eleven bitmaps are no longer used by Windows, but must be
supplied for compatibility with applications that expect them to be
available.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 3.1 Bitmaps</h3>
 
<P>
The following four bitmaps are new for Windows 3.1:
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: The SYSBIT sample does not display these bitmaps, but they are
   illustrated in the documentation (as are the rest of the bitmaps listed
   below) for the LoadBitmap() function in the Windows SDK.
