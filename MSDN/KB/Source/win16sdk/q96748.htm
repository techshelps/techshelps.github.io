The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.1 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Executing the following function in the English language returns -1,
indicating that a lowercase 'e' is less than an uppercase 'Z':
<P>
<PRE>   lstrcmp("e","Z");

</PRE>This is contrary to the order of characters using ASCII sorting.
However, it is correct behavior or lstrcmp().
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
lstrcmp() performs a comparison in the same manner as does a real
dictionary. Characters are compared in a case-insensitive manner
first, then specific details are compared (for example, lowercase
versus uppercase).
<P>
lstrcmp() performs its comparisons by first setting up a primary and
secondary weight. The primary weight is the value of the character
after converting to uppercase. The secondary weight describes whether
the character was originally lowercase or uppercase.
<P>
Using the standard ASCII table as a guide (0...9ABC...XYZabc...xyz),
the following are examples of lstrcmp:
<P>
<PRE>   "A" &lt; "a" &lt; "B" &lt; "b"
   "Aaa" &lt; "aaa" &lt; "Aab"

</PRE>In the first example, "A" is less than "a" because:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Both characters are converted to uppercase.
   2. The primary weights are compared and found equal.
   3. Because the primary weights are equal, the secondary weights are
      compared. It is then determined that "A" is less than "a"
      because "a" is higher in the ASCII chart.

</PRE>Also in the first example, "a" is less than "B" because:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Both characters are converted to uppercase.
   2. The primary weights are compared and it is determined that "A"
      is less than "B" on the ASCII chart. No secondary weight
      comparison is performed.

</PRE>In the second example, "Aaa" is less than "aaa" following the same
logic shown in the comparison of "A" and "a".
<P>
When two characters are compared and they are equal, this is called a
"collision," and "delayed comparison" will be performed using the
secondary weight.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE EXAMPLES</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>   e,a  --&gt; E,A --&gt; E&gt;A = 1
   e,e  --&gt; E,E --&gt; E=E = 0  Because they are equal, the case is
                             checked (secondary weight).
   e,z  --&gt; E,Z --&gt; E&lt;Z = -1

   e,A  --&gt; E,A --&gt; E&gt;A = 1
   e,E  --&gt; E,E --&gt; E=E = 1  Because they are equal, the case is
                             checked (secondary weight).
   e,F  --&gt; E,F --&gt; E&lt;F = -1

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you need to sort by ASCII values using case sensitivity, use the C
run-time function strcmp() or _fstrcmp().
<P>
Also, Far East Windows-based applications adopt this dictionary sorting
technique in English and local languages.
<P>
For detailed information about the sort order used with non-alphabetic
characters, accented characters, and characters in international
languages, query on the following words in this Knowledge Base:
