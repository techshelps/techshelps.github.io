   versions 3.1 and 3.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The server's callback function will have received XTYP_ADVREQ for each
existing advise loop that was started without a XTYPF_ACKREQ flag, by the
time DdePostAdvise returns. So DdePostAdvise is synchronous except for
advise loops started with the XTYPF_ACKREQ flag.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The DdePostAdvise function causes the Dynamic Data Exchange Management
Library (DDEML) to send a XTYP_ADVREQ transaction to the calling (server)
application's DDEML callback function for each client that has an advise
loop active on the specified topic or item name pair. A server application
calls this function whenever the data associated with the topic or item
name pair changes.
<P>
DDEML will have sent XTYP_ADVREQ for each advise loop that was started
without a XTYPF_ACKREQ when DdePostAdvise returns.
<P>
If an advise loop was started with the XTYPF_ACKREQ flag, the server will
have to wait until the client acknowledges that it received the previous
data item. Consequently, if the client did not acknowledge the previous
data item, DdePostAdvise will set a flag for the advise loop indicating the
data change and XTYP_ADVREQ will be sent by DDEML only after the client
acknowledges the previous data item. The cAdvReq parameter of XTYP_ADVREQ
for the slow client will contain CADV_LATEACK instead of the remaining
advise loops to be processed.
<P>
This means that DdePostAdvise can return before the server callback
receives the XTYP_ADVREQ corresponding to a XTYPF_ACKREQ advise loop. This
is not a problem because when the client used XTYPF_ACKREQ, it was willing
to miss some of the data transitions in order to prevent the server from
sending it data faster than could be processed. The server can send the
slow client the latest data when it finally receives the XTYPF_ADVREQ with
cAdvReq set to CADV_LATEACK.
