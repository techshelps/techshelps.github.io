The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
We are not aware of any kind of Windows-to-Macintosh interpreter or
translator that will allow you to directly run Windows code on the
Macintosh, but there are some alternatives:

<OL><P><LI>The January 1989 issue of the "Microsoft Systems Journal" contains
   two relevant articles titled "Developing Applications with Common
   Source Code for Multiple Environments" and "Porting Apple Macintosh
   Applications to the Microsoft Windows Environment."

<P><LI>The "Windows Developer Guidebook" [available by calling
   (800) 426-9600] contains a listing for a product that helps you
   develop code in an environment-independent way. The product is
   called XVT (Extensible Virtual Toolkit) for Microsoft Windows,
   Presentation Manager, and Macintosh. XVT is made by the following
   company:
<P>
<P><PRE>      GSS (Graphical Software Systems)
      9590 SW Gemini Drive
      Beaverton, OR  97005
      (503) 643-8642
</PRE><P>
   According to GSS, "XVT allows developers to create and maintain one
   set of source code and port it to Windows, PM, and Macintosh
   environments."
<P>

<P><LI>A third-party product called CommonView contains Glockenspiel C++
   object libraries to simplify creation of applications for Windows
   and OS/2 Presentation Manager (PM) using the same core source code.
   Contact the company to find out more about porting to the Macintosh.
<P>
   CommonView is a set of class libraries for creating Microsoft
   Windows and PM applications. They come with the C++ compiler, which
   is an object-oriented version of C. They are actually translators
   that translate C++ code into C code, which you can then run through
   your C compiler. You can write an application using CommonView, and
   it will isolate you from the particular Windows environment. The product
   is distributed by Imagesoft, (800) 245-8840 or (516) 767-2233.
<P>
</OL>XVT and CommonView are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
