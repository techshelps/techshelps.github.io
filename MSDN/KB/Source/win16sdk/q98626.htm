<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Software Library, there is a sample called AnnoPrnt.
This is a Windows for Pen Computing sample that demonstrates how to
annotate a text file with ink, and then print out the resulting
annotated text to any printer.
<P>
Download ANNOPRNT.EXE from the Microsoft Software Library (MSL) on the
following services:

</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Using the AnnoPrnt sample as a starting point, developers can view one
method to output annotated text. Certain Windows for Pen Computing
application programming interfaces (APIs) are more suited to output to
printer devices. This is the case here with using DrawPenData rather
than RedisplayPenData. RedisplayPenData is more device-dependent on the
video driver and not meant to be used in printer calls.
<P>
The AnnoPrnt sample also shows how to output different colors of ink
so that developers can view the results of the color mapping on their
respective printer; some colors are mapped such that they don't show
up on a printer.
<P>
Another method of printing involves printing the entire image (the
annotated text file) as a device-independent bitmap (DIB), thus
allowing the driver, not GDI, to do the color mapping. Drivers
typically do a better mapping to grayscale, and therefore if color is
important, using DIBs is an alternative. The WINCAP sample in the
Software Library demonstrates outputting DIBs to printers.
<P>
The AnnoPrnt sample was carefully checked for possible printing
problems; however, because so much is dependent on printer drivers,
future errors are possible.
