The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft WinG API, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed the items in the following list to be bugs in the
Microsoft WinG API.

<UL><LI>Some Western Digital drivers cause the WinG display profiler to crash.
   The second time a WinG application is run, the profiler will not run and
   WinG will attempt to use the driver's StretchDIBits without profiling.
   This may or may not let the application run depending on what caused the
   original crash.

<LI>The WinG installation will not work on networked Windows installations
   (setup /n) because the WinG setup program needs to write to the system
   directory.

<LI>If your application needs to link to TOOLHELP, you must call TOOLHELP's
   LibMain before you call WinG. Work-arounds include changing the DLL
   initialization order, or linking dynamically to WING.DLL or
   TOOLHELP.DLL. If you are using Microsoft Visual C++, you can change the
   initialization order by following these steps:
<P>
   1. Go to Project/Edit and check the list of files you have in the
<P><PRE>      project. If you have included WING.LIB, delete it.
</PRE><P>
   2. Go to Options/Project/Linker/Input/Windows Libraries and clear the
<P><PRE>      TOOLHELP selection.
</PRE><P>
   3. Go to Options/Project/Linker/Input/Input and hard code the
<P><PRE>      locations of TOOLHELP.LIB, followed by WING.LIB and then the rest
      of the libraries as usual. For example:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      C:\MSVC\LIB\TOOLHELP, C:\WING\LIB\WING, oldnames, libw, mlibcew
</PRE>
<LI>Video cards using the Cirrus Logic chipset may cause WinG to display the
   following warning each time WinG is loaded; once should be enough:
<P>
<P><PRE>      WinG has encountered a problem with your video display driver.
      Contact the manufacturer of your card to obtain the most recent
      driver. Your WinG applications will still run, but at reduced speed.
</PRE>
<LI>When WinG closes down, it leaks selectors, the memory is freed when the
   WinG DLL exits.

<LI>On Win32s, calls to WinGGetDIBColorTable() do not retrieve the color
   table of a WinG bitmap. Possible work-arounds include keeping track of
   the color table yourself or thunking to the 16-bit
   WinGGetDIBColorTable().
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed these to be bugs in WinG version 1.0. Microsoft is
researching these problems and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
