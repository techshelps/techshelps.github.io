<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a list of documents available from Microsoft
that discuss TrueType fonts with reference to their use in Microsoft
Windows operating system version 3.1.
<P>
The documents are broadly classified into three categories on the
basis of their technical scope. Documents in the "End User" category
have information about using TrueType fonts for the Windows 3.1 end
user. Documents in the "Application Developer" category discuss the
impact of TrueType fonts on Windows-based applications and contain
technical details that let application developers use, and take advantage
of, TrueType font technology in their applications. Documents in the
"Font/Tool/Curious Developer" category contain information useful to
developers interested in developing their own TrueType fonts or
font-development tools, or interested in knowing about the inner
workings of the TrueType font technology.
<P>
Each entry contains information to help the reader obtain a copy of
the document. Many of the following documents will be available as
part of the upcoming Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) CD. For more
information about this CD, call the Microsoft Developer Services Team
at (800) 227-4679.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>End User Oriented Documents</h3>

in Chapter 9, "Fonts," of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" manual.
<P>
<P>
Title: "Microsoft TrueType Font Pack User's Guide"

TrueType fonts, designing documents with TrueType fonts, and a brief
history of the TryeType font technology.

Font Pack for Windows. The font pack is an assortment of 44 TrueType
fonts. Call Microsoft Consumer Sales at (800) 426-9400 for purchasing
information.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Application Developer Oriented Documents</h3>
 
<P>
Title: Chapter 18, "Fonts," in the "Guide to Programming"
<P>
What to expect: This document contains a gentle introduction to using
fonts in applications. It begins with a discussion of the fundamentals
of fonts, introduces the three font technologies used in Windows 3.1
(with an emphasis on TrueType fonts), discusses TrueType font
technology in the context of WYSIWYG and document/printer/platform
portability, and finally delves into the details of using fonts (with
due attention paid to TrueType) in Windows 3.1 applications.
<P>
Finding a copy: This manual is shipped with the Windows 3.1 Software
Development Kit (SDK). All the information is also available in the
SDK 3.1 online documentation (WIN31WH.HLP) under the subject headings
"Font Fundamentals," "Fonts in Windows," "TrueType Font Technology,"
and "Using Fonts in Applications."
<P>
<P>
Title: "Windows Font Mapping"
Author: Ron Gery
<P>
What to expect: This document discusses the Windows 3.1 font mapper
and how it controls the realization of fonts. Attention is paid to
selecting TrueType fonts and the effect of having TrueType fonts on
the fonts selected by applications developed for Windows 3.0 (which
does not have TrueType fonts).
<P>
Finding a copy: This document is available as part of the MSDN CD.
<P>
<P>
Title: "Using TrueType"
Author: Ron Gery
<P>
What to expect: This document gives a basic introduction to using
TrueType in an application under Windows 3.1. It discusses most of the
TrueType functions, enumerating and selecting TrueType fonts,
positioning TrueType characters in documents, and page layout.
<P>
Finding a copy: This document is available as part of the MSDN CD-ROM.
<P>
<P>
Title: "TrueType and Microsoft Windows Version 3.1"
Authors: David Weise and Dennis Adler
<P>
What to expect: This document introduces some font concepts and
details the various aspects of using TrueType fonts in applications
developed for Windows 3.1.
<P>
Finding a copy: This document is available as part of the MSDN CD-ROM.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Font/Tool/Curious Developer Oriented Documents</h3>
 
<P>
Title: "Advanced TrueType: GetGlyphOutline"
Author: Ron Gery
<P>
What to expect: This document presents an explanation of the
GetGlyphOutline function. It complements the definition of
GetGlyphOutline found in the Windows SDK 3.1 reference manual and
extends the definition by providing explanations for those portions of
the GetGlyphOutline function that were omitted in the SDK 3.1 manual.
<P>
Finding a copy: This document is available as part of the MSDN CD-ROM.
<P>
<P>
Title: "An Introduction to Digital Typography Using TrueType"
Author: George Moore
<P>
What to expect: This transcript of a technical talk lists the basic
steps that a typical computer system goes through in order to display
characters on the output device and details these steps for TrueType
fonts in Windows 3.1.
<P>
Finding a copy: This document is available as part of the MSDN CD-ROM.
<P>
<P>
Title: "Linear vs. Nonlinear Scaling"
Author: George Moore
<P>
What to expect: This transcript of a technical talk describes the
importance of being able to nonlinearly scale a font. It discusses how
a TrueType font vendor can use nonlinear scaling so that
low-resolution devices can display high-quality TrueType fonts.
<P>
Finding a copy: This document is available in the Microsoft Software
Library as document S13452.
<P>
<P>
Title: "TrueType Font Files Specification Version 1.0"
<P>
What to expect: This specification details how to construct a
TrueType font from scratch (or build a tool to do so), the TrueType
programming language, and the complete format of each subtable
contained in the .TTF file. It also contains illustrations.
<P>
Finding a copy: This document is spread over three documents (S13442,
S13443, S13444) and is available in the Microsoft Software Library.
