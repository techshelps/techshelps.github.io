<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Multiple applications, each running in Windows for Workgroups version
3.1 on different workstations, can share a file residing on a server
with full read-write access while simultaneously keeping the file
open. File region locking ensures that data integrity of the file is
not lost. The Windows for Workgroups network redirector caches file
I/O operations unless file locking is used. It will seem that Windows
for Workgroups clients are failing to write data unless the
applications lock file regions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Opening a file with READ_WRITE access and using the OF_SHARE_DENY_NONE
file sharing flag is possible from more than one application each
running from a different workstation. Applications sharing a file from
a server must use the same file sharing flags. Keeping the file open
may be a necessary specification for networked database management
systems because it is more efficient to keep the file open than to
open and close the file for each file-access operation. However, not
all applications should be designed to keep the file open during the
use of a file.
<P>
To better understand file sharing, consider an application running on
Workstation A opening a file that resides on the disk of Server S. An
application running on Workstation B can also open the same file so
that each application is aware of the updates made to the file on
Server S if the file is opened with READ_WRITE access and the
OF_SHARE_DENY_NONE sharing flag.
<P>
To ensure that two or more applications do not access the shared file
in the same region at the same time, locking is used to create
exclusive access to a region of the file. File region locking by one
application causes failure of file I/O operations performed by other
applications sharing the file. The sharing component of Windows for
Workgroups, VSHARE.386, keeps track of the region that is locked and
fails the file I/O operation attempting to access the shared file,
including any portion of the locked region. This is very critical to
file sharing; if one application is writing information into a
location of a shared file at the same instance another application is
reading from the same location of the shared file, there is a loss of
data integrity.
<P>
In Windows for Workgroups, file I/O operations are redirected to the
server drive via the network redirector component, VREDIR.386 (in
enhanced mode) or WORKGRP.SYS (in standard mode). The network
redirector of Windows for Workgroups caches file I/O operations. The
redirector will disable the cache if file locking is enabled, and
therefore even if two applications are sharing files and are being
careful so that there is no file access concurrency, Windows for
Workgroups will still fail to perform the file I/O unless file locking
is used. One application reading from the file will not be reading the
latest updates from the application writing to the file or data will
not seem to be written to disk.
<P>
The following summarizes key points when implementing applications to
share files residing on a server for full read-write access.

<UL><LI>Open the file with READ_WRITE access and OF_SHARE_DENY_NONE sharing
   flag.

<LI>Before reading or writing, lock the region of the file about to be
   accessed. Use _locking() from the Microsoft C Run-time library or
   MS-DOS Interrupt 21h function 5Ch to lock the file region.

<LI>Immediately following a read or a write, unlock the region. Use
   _locking() or Interrupt 21h function 5Ch to unlock the file region.
   For courtesy to other applications using the file, do not exclude the
   use of a file region for a long period of time. Lock the file region
   only during accessing (reading or writing).

<LI>If the lock fails, this means that some portion of the region of
   the file is locked by another application. The application is not
   allowed access to this region until the other application releases it
   by unlocking the region.
