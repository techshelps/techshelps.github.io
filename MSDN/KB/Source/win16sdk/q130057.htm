   version 3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is not trivial to support multiple languages in a single Windows-based
application. Unlike Windows NT, Windows has no built-in support for
different language versions of a single resource.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The easiest way to do it and the way it is done for Windows itself and all
our localized Windows-based applications, is to have separate executables
for each language (English, German, French, and so on) version.
<P>
However, it is possible to create a single executable that supports
multiple language resources. For example, you could have a separate DLL
containing the resources for different language versions of your
application. You can link a specific version of DLL in runtime.
<P>
The language selection should be an install-time option, because there is
no official way to identify the host language. The application needs to ask
the user to confirm what the application has found.
<P>
All the messages and system errors generated by Windows, regardless of your
resource files, will displayed as the local language error messages.
<P>
If an application needs to have one resource file, the developer must
create a unique resource ID for each language version of the resource, and
then load the appropriate resource depending on the language. For example,
the following string table could be created:
<P>
<PRE>   IDS_HELLO_ENGLISH, "Hello"
   IDS_HELLO_GERMAN, "Hallo"

</PRE>The application would then either load the English string or the German
string as required.
<P>
There is no documentation on this subject because it is not a feature of
Windows. There is a new book out that has a chapter on internationalizing
applications. It is written in a friendly manner. Microsoft Windows 3.1
Developer's Workshop by Dr. John Butler; it's published by Microsoft Press.
In addition, the Microsoft Developer Relations Group is currently revising
"The International Handbook."
