<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Software Library, there is a sample called AlcKey.
This is a Windows for Pen Computing sample that demonstrates how to
use the ALC values (defined in Windows for Pen Computing) to set how
an hedit (or bedit) control filters its input.
<P>
Download ALCKEY.EXE, a self-extracting file, from the Microsoft Software
Library (MSL) on the following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<P><PRE>      Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL
      Download <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/ALCKEY.EXE">ALCKEY.EXE</A> <I>(size: 25286 bytes)</I> 
</PRE>
<LI>Internet (anonymous FTP)
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
      Change to the \SOFTLIB\MSLFILES directory
      Get <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/ALCKEY.EXE">ALCKEY.EXE</A> <I>(size: 25286 bytes)</I> 
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
ALC values can be set to define what values are recognized in a pen
edit control (either hedit or bedit). For example, by setting
ALC_NUMERIC, only numeric values are recognized in that particular
control. Using ALC values allows developers greater freedom to
customize how their application responds to ink. By defining a small
subset of only the types of values wanted in an edit control,
recognition of those values increases.
<P>
The AlcKey sample has two edit controls, hedit and bedit. By selecting
the ALC flags desired via the ALC dialog box, the hedit control is set
to those values. The bedit control is not altered, allowing the
developer to view the difference between the settings of the two
controls.
<P>
The AlcKey sample also demonstrates the use of the ShowKeyboard()
application programming interface (API), including the recommended way
of interfacing to the virtual keyboard via a "keyboard" button; which
is OwnerDraw. Note that the virtual keyboard always stays on top, but
never has the focus. The output of the keyboard is directed to the
last control that had the focus. Note also that the virtual keyboard
in Windows for Pen Computing version 1.0 is not affected by the
filtering effects of the ALC values. Only recognized ink is affected;
the keyboard does not involve inking, so it bypasses this step.
