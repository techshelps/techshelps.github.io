The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The amount of free GDI resources decreases as an application prints,
especially over the course of several print jobs.
<P>
NOTE: The information in this article also applies to the screen; however,
this issue more often impacts applications when printing, and therefore
that is the specific subject of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The application caches GDI objects by creating them and not deleting them
until the application terminates. Those objects are selected in and out of
a printer device context (DC) when needed, over the course of several print
jobs.
<P>
GDI creates a new physical object structure for each logical object that is
selected into a printer DC. New physical objects are created even if the
same logical objects are selected into a different printer DC. Those
physical objects are not deleted until the corresponding logical objects
are deleted. The more objects used in printing, and the more jobs that are
printed using those objects, the more physical objects are created and more
GDI resources are used up.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Do not cache GDI objects (such as pens, brushes, and fonts). Instead,
create them, use them during printing, and then delete them after each
print job.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Microsoft Windows version
3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can be reproduced as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Create a logical object such as a pen, brush, or font.

<P><LI>Repeatedly:
<P>
   a. Create a printer DC.
   b. Select the object into and out of the printer DC.
   c. Delete the printer DC.
<P>
</OL>With each iteration, GDI memory decreases.
