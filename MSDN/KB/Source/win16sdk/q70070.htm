<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information below describes a set of functions available in the
Microsoft Software Library for formatting time and date strings using the
international settings in the Windows Control Panel.
<P>
WINTIME is a file in the Microsoft Software Library that formats time and
date strings according to the Control Panel settings.
<P>
Download WINTIME.EXE, a self-extracting file, from the Microsoft Software
Library (MSL) on the following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<P><PRE>      Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL
      Download <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/WINTIME.EXE">WINTIME.EXE</A> <I>(size: 30332 bytes)</I> 
</PRE>
<LI>Internet (anonymous FTP)
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
      Change to the \SOFTLIB\MSLFILES directory
      Get <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/WINTIME.EXE">WINTIME.EXE</A> <I>(size: 30332 bytes)</I> 
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows allows the user to specify, with the Control Panel, the appropriate
format for the date and time in the user's country. The Windows API
provides no function to format strings of date and time information
according to the Control Panel's settings. The sample code module WINTIME.C
provides C source code for five functions that an application can use to
format the date and time.
<P>
WINTIME.C is designed to be as flexible and portable as possible. The
module can be used in an application or in a dynamic-link library (DLL)
without modification.
<P>
Included with the WINTIME.C file is a sample application that demonstrates
how to use the functions.
<P>
The five functions provided by WINTIME are documented below:

<OL><P><LI>LPSTR FAR PASCAL TimeGetCurDate(LPSTR lpszDate, WORD wFlags)
<P>
   Description:
<P><PRE>     TimeGetCurDate() returns the current date, formatted as specified
     by the user in the Control Panel.
</PRE><P>
   Arguments:
<P><PRE>     Type/Name
<PRE></PRE>              Description

     LPSTR lpszDate
              Points to a buffer that is to receive the date. Must be
              large enough to hold the longest date possible (64 bytes
              should be large enough).
     struct tm *lpTM
              Pointer to a "tm" structure (from TIME.H) that contains
              the time and date to be formatted.

     WORD wFlags
              Specifies flags that modify the behavior of the function.
              May be any of the following:

        Flag              Meaning
        ----              -------
        0                 The date will be formatted exactly the way
                          Control Panel does it, using Windows's
                          international settings. The date will be in
                          the long date format (Sunday, January 1,
                          1991).

        DATE_SHORTDATE    Forces the date to be formatted using the
                          short date format (1/01/91).

        DATE_NODAYOFWEEK  The date will be formatted without the day
                          of week. This flag may not be used with the
                          DATE_SHORTDATE flag (that is, January 1,
                          1991).

     LPSTR lpszTime
              Points to a buffer that is to receive the formatted
              time. Must be large enough to hold the longest date
              possible (64 bytes should be large enough).

     WORD wFlags

                          1:00:00 AM).

        TIME_12HOUR       The time will be formatted in 12 hour format
                          regardless of the WIN.INI international
                          settings. This flag may not be used with the
                          TIME_24HOUR flag (for example, 2:32:10 PM).

        TIME_24HOUR       The time will be formatted in 24 hour format
                          regardless of the WIN.INI international

        TIME_NOSECONDS    The time will be formatted without seconds
                          (for example, 2:32 PM).

     current time and date format settings.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     This function should be called every time a WM_WININICHANGE
     message is sent for the [intl] section and when the DLL or
     application using these functions is invoked.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>     These variables are in the DLL data segment. Therefore, if one
     application changes this information, the others will see the
