The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Drawing lines to a memory DC containing a complex clipping region causes an
unrecoverable application error (UAE) or general protection (GP) fault.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Under certain rare conditions, drawing a single line to a DC containing a
complex clipping region will cause a UAE under Windows 3.0 and a GP fault
under Windows 3.1.
<P>
The conditions for this UAE/GP fault to occur are as follows:

<UL><LI>The clipping region for the DC must be a complex region. For example,
   the clipping region must contain multiple rectangles. [The
   ExcludeClipRect() and IntersectClipRect() functions will also tell you
   whether the region is complex.]

<LI>The clipping region must have its top physical coordinate at the Y
   origin. For example, if you are using a memory bitmap in the MM_TEXT
   mapping mode, the clipping region might have an upper-left corner of
   (0,0).

<LI>The line being drawn must be a "Y-major" line, meaning that the line
   extends in the Y-direction farther than it does in the X- direction.

<LI>The line must start above the top edge of the region (negative Y space)
   and end 1 pixel from the upper-right corner of the clipping region.
<P>
</UL>For the UAE/GP fault to occur, all the above conditions must be met.
<P>
For example, when the following GDI calls are performed on a memory
bitmap, a UAE/GP fault will occur in the VGA display driver:
<P>
<PRE>   IntersectClipRect(hDC, 0, 0, 20, 20); // Top is at Y=0
   ExcludeClipRect(hDC, 5, 5, 15, 30);   // Makes region complex
   MoveTo(hDC, 15,-10);            // This line is Y-major
   LineTo(hDC, 19, 0);             // Hits upper-right of region

</PRE>The UAE/GP fault occurs at the display driver level because GDI is sending
an incorrect parameter to the display driver's Output() function. The
clipping rectangle sent to this function contains a -1 for one of the
points, and negative values for clipping rectangles are not valid. A few
display drivers, for example the XGA driver, perform parameter checking on
this clipping rectangle and will not fail. Others, like the V7VGA, VGA, and
8514/a display drivers do not perform validation on this call and will
produce a UAE/GP fault.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Because this problem occurs only when the Y origin of your hDC is at the
physical (screen coordinate) Y origin, it is unlikely that this problem
will occur while you are drawing to a standard screen DC. For this UAE/GP
fault to occur on a screen DC, the top of your client area would have to be
at the screen Y origin, which is normally not the case.
<P>
On the other hand, memory bitmaps are implemented so that the physical Y
origin is at the top of the bitmap, and the UAE/GP fault is much more
likely to occur when drawing to a memory bitmap. If your application uses
complex clipping regions on a memory DC, do the following to work around
this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Assuming you're working in the MM_TEXT mapping mode, set your Viewport
   origin to (0,-1) by calling SetViewportOrg(hMemDC, 0,- 1). This will
   cause your logical origin (0,0) to be moved one pixel down in the DC.

<P><LI>Make sure that your logical clipping rectangle does not extend above the
   logical Y=0 origin. In other words, the top Y coordinate of your
   clipping rectangle cannot be less than 0 (or less than 1).
<P>
</OL>To ensure that the second condition is met, you must verify that all calls
to IntersectClipRect() and ExcludeClipRect() (which both take logical
coordinates) do not cause a logical clipping region that extends above the
Y origin to be created.
<P>
Note that there is a distinction between logical and physical clipping
regions; the above workaround works only with a logical clipping region. If
you create a region and then select it into your DC as a clipping region,
the coordinates for this region are device coordinates rather than logical
coordinates. In this case, you need to manually offset of the top of the
region by 1.
<P>
Some of the functions that create physical regions are CreateRectRgn(),
CreateEllipticRgn(), and OffsetRgn(). The functions GetClipBox() and
GetRgnBox() can be used to determine the upper physical-coordinate extent
of the regions.
<P>
If your application uses only the functions IntersectClipRect() and
ExcludeClipRect(), your clipping regions will be in logical units.
<P>
Another workaround is to either not use complex clipping regions in your
memory bitmaps or manually verify that no lines will be drawn above the top
of your Y origin.
<P>
NOTE: This UAE/GP fault might be generated for more than just
MoveTo()/LineTo() calls--it can occur for any GDI call that generates
lines, including rectangle, polygon, polypolygon, arc, and vector font
output.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a,
and 3.1. However, because the conditions for this error to occur are very
specific, most Windows applications will never encounter this problem. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
