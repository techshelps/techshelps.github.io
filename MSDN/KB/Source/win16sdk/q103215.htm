<P><h3>Abstract</h3>
 
<P>
This article is aimed at people who would like to create a Microsoft
Windows-based application that does some form of animation, or who
would like to understand how to improve the performance of an existing
animated application, or who are considering porting an MS-DOS--based
application to Windows. The main focus of the article is on using
device-independent bitmaps (DIBs) for the images and the DIB driver
(DIB.DRV) for the off-screen image buffer. The article is written
around a sample application, Sprites, which is included with the
article. Some knowledge of animation techniques is assumed. If you're
looking for a "How to Do Animation" article, this isn't it. The
following points are covered:

<UL><LI>Using the DIB driver

<LI>Palettes

<LI>Measuring and improving performance

<LI>Lots of useful little tips and hints
<P>
</UL>SPRITES demonstrates sprite (cast-based) animation in a Microsoft
Windows-based application using device-independent bitmaps (DIBs)
for the images and the DIB driver (DIB.DRV) for the off-screen image
buffer.
<P>
The SPRITES application uses a DIB for a background scene, and allows
you to load multiple sprites on top of the background scene. Each
sprite has x, y, and z coordinates, optional x and y velocity, and a
flag that indicates whether it can be dragged by the mouse.
<P>
A background and a set of sprites can be combined into a scene
described in a simple INI file. You can load the entire scene by
choosing the Load Scene command from the File menu.
<P>
The application updates the positions of all sprites that have a
non-zero velocity as fast as it can, using a PeekMessage() loop. Sprites
that have the selectable attribute set can be dragged with the mouse.
Double-clicking a sprite brings up a dialog box for setting sprite
attributes.
<P>
