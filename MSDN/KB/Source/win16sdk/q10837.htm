<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following discussion on Windows fonts describes how they are
defined and why they are necessary.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>How Default Fonts Are Assigned</h3>
 
<P>
At the API level, Windows version 3.0 defines six stock fonts. Each of
these fonts has a logical description. At Windows 3.0 boot time, GDI
constructs the logical description of these fonts in the following
manner:

<OL><P><LI>During its initialization, GDI calls an internal function,
   InitFonts(), which is responsible for physically loading three
   basic fonts. Under a typical Windows 3.0 installation, the names of
   the font files for these fonts are listed in the [boot] section of
   the SYSTEM.INI file. For example, this section (in part) resembles
   the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      fixedfon.fon=vgafix.fon
      oemfonts.fon=vgaoem.fon
      fonts.fon=vgasys.fon
</PRE><P>
   The system font is loaded first. GDI first checks the WIN.INI file
   in the [windows] section for the key name SystemFont=&lt;file&gt;, where
   &lt;file&gt; is a name of a bitmap font (such as HELV.FON). If GDI finds
   this keyname, it will attempt to load the specified file as the
   system font. Changing this value is one method the user can use to
   customize the system font.
<P>
   NOTE: If you change SystemFont=&lt;font&gt; you *must* also have the line
   fonts.fon=&lt;font&gt; in the [windows] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
   Otherwise, Windows will not load properly.
<P>
   If GDI does not find this key name, it attempts to load the system
   font from a file called FONTS.FON using the GDI function
   AddFontResource. Notice that on typical installations of Windows
   3.0, there is no file called FONTS.FON. AddFontResource calls
   LoadLibrary to load the specified file. If the file is not found,
   LoadLibrary will search the SYSTEM.INI file (in the [boot] section)
   for a redirection of the file. As shown above, the [boot] section
   of SYSTEM.INI for a VGA system contains the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      fonts.fon=vgasys.fon
</PRE><P>
   This line indicates that the system font should be loaded from the
   file VGASYS.FON, which resides in the system directory.

<P><LI>Once the system font is physically loaded, GDI attempts to load a
   fixed-pitch font. GDI examines the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI
   file and extracts the filename from the fixedfon.fon= field. If no
   file is specified, the system font (loaded in step 1) is
   substituted for the system fixed-pitch font.

<P><LI>Next, the terminal font is loaded. GDI attempts to load the file
   OEMFONTS.FON (via AddFontResource). This file may be redirected in
   the same manner as the system font in step 1.

<P><LI>Later during its initialization, GDI gets the module handle of
   DISPLAY. Using the module handle, it does a FindResource() on the
   resource string "fonts", which is an array of three LOGFONT
   structures that have been defined by the display driver
   manufacturer. This is the resource that is included in the display
   driver's .RC file with the line:
<P>
<PRE>      fonts   oembin  PRELOAD         fonts.bin

   Once this resource is found, GDI steps through the array of
   LOGFONTS and calls CreateFontIndirect to create the stock font
   objects:

      OEM_FIXED_FONT
      ANSI_FIXED_FONT
      ANSI_VAR_FONT

   These logical font definitions can be thought of as recommendations
   for a particular display by the display driver.

   In general, these logical font descriptions will map to one of the
   physical fonts loaded initially by GDI.

   However, when an application selects one of these stock fonts, the
   font mapper selects the closest matching font from a list of
   available physical fonts in the system. This list contains the
   initial system fonts that were loaded by GDI, in addition to other
   fonts that may have been loaded at a later time. Therefore, there
   is no guarantee that a given stock font will necessarily map to one
   of the three initial fonts loaded by GDI.

</PRE><P><LI>Once these three stock fonts have been defined, GDI defines the
   stock font SYSTEM_FONT. GDI does this by opening the system font
   file loaded in step 1 and builds a logical font structure that
   exactly matches the physical characteristics of the physical font.
   This is to ensure that the font mapper will select this physical
   font when the SYSTEM_FONT stock font is requested.

<P><LI>Finally, the logical description of the device default font
   (DEVICE_DEFAULT_FONT) is defined. This font is defined to be the
   same as the SYSTEM_FONT.
<P>
</OL><h3>Why These Fonts Are Necessary</h3>
 
<P>
There are two reasons for having these six stock fonts. One reason is
to provide an OEM font that displays well at 10 pitch on the machine.
This font is also used to determine the height of dialog boxes. The
second reason is to provide ANSI fonts that are based on proposed
standards (device-independent) and match Microsoft's virtual-key
definitions.
<P>
Please note that all of these fonts are required. The display driver
must include the three logical fonts (described above) or GDI will not
initialize properly.
