The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When the Microsoft Windows Heap Walker application (HEAPWALK.EXE) that is
shipped with the Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1 SDK is started or
if another application is started after Heap Walker is running, a general
protection (GP) fault may occur with the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   HEAPWALK caused a general Protection Fault in
   module HEAPWALK.EXE at xxxx.xxxx.

</PRE>If Dr. Watson is running, it reports the fault as:
<P>
<PRE>   'Exceed Segment Bounds (Write)' fault at HEAPWALK xxxx:xxxx

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is a bug in the Heap Walker application that results in a GP
fault when there are too many objects in the global heap. This
problem happens more often when many applications are running in
the system. The problem can also happen, however, when only a few
applications are running in the system but some of them are
allocating a number of global memory blocks.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Do one of the following to resolve this problem:

<UL><LI>Do not run the Heap Walker application when many applications are
   running in the system. If the GP fault occurs, exit and restart
   Windows, and run Heap Walker only when a few applications are
   running.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the updated version of the Heap Walker application available
   in the Software Library. The updated version, called
   NEWHEAP, corrects the GP fault problem.
<P>
</UL>Download NEWHEAP.EXE, a self-extracting file, from the Microsoft Software
Library (MSL) on the following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<P><PRE>      Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL
      Download <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/NEWHEAP.EXE">NEWHEAP.EXE</A> <I>(size: 35070 bytes)</I> 
</PRE>
<LI>Internet (anonymous FTP)
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
      Change to the \SOFTLIB\MSLFILES directory
      Get <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/NEWHEAP.EXE">NEWHEAP.EXE</A> <I>(size: 35070 bytes)</I> 
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the Heap Walker application is started, it tries to list all the
objects in the global heap in its main window. It uses the Toolhelp
Library to walk the global heap, and it keeps track of all these
objects in a linked list. If there are a large number of objects in
the global heap, the linked list would grow beyond a 64K segment. Any
global object that grows larger than a 64K segment must be accessed
using huge pointers, otherwise an error will occur. In the Heap Walker
application, the linked list is being accessed using far pointers
instead of huge pointers. This results in a GP fault.
<P>
The updated version of Heap Walker corrects this problem by using huge
pointers instead of far pointers to access the linked list.
