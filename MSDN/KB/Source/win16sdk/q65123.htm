</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Formats for Microsoft Windows font files are defined for both raster
and vector fonts. These formats can be used by smart text generators
in some GDI support modules. The vector formats, in particular, are
more frequently used by GDI itself than by support modules.
<P>
Both raster and vector font files begin with information that is
common to both, and then continue with information that differs for
each type of file.
<P>
For Windows 3.0, the font-file header includes six new fields:
dFlags, dfAspace, dfBspace, dfCspace, dfColorPointer, and dfReserved1.
These fields are not used in Windows 3.0. To ensure compatibility
with future versions of Windows, these fields should be set to zero.
<P>
All device drivers support the Windows 2.x fonts. However, not all
device drivers support the Windows 3.0 version.
<P>
Windows 3.0 font files include the glyph table in dfCharTable, which
consists of structures that describe the bits for characters in the
font file. This version enables fonts to exceed 64K in size, the size
limit of Windows 2.x fonts. This is made possible by the use of 32-bit
offsets to the character glyphs in dfCharTable.
<P>
Because of the 32-bit offsets and their potentially large size, these
fonts are designed for use on systems that are running Windows version
3.0 in protected (standard or 386 enhanced) mode with an 80386 (or
higher) processor where the processor's 32-bit registers can access
the character glyphs. Typically, device drivers use the Windows 3.0
version of a font only when both of these conditions are true.
<P>
Font files are stored with an .FNT extension of the form NAME.FNT. The
information at the beginning of both raster and vector versions of
Windows 3.0 font files is shown in the following list:
<P>
<PRE>Field          Description
-----          -----------

dfVersion      2 bytes specifying the version (0200H or 0300H) of
               the file.

dfSize         4 bytes specifying the total size of the file in
               bytes.

dfCopyright    60 bytes specifying copyright information.

dfType         2 bytes specifying the type of font file.

               The low-order byte is exclusively for GDI use. If the
               low-order bit of the WORD is zero, it is a bitmap
               (raster) font file. If the low-order bit is 1, it is a
               vector font file. The second bit is reserved and must
               be zero. If no bits follow in the file and the bits are
               located in memory at a fixed address specified in
               dfBitsOffset, the third bit is set to 1; otherwise, the
               bit is set to 0 (zero). The high-order bit of the low
               byte is set if the font was realized by a device. The
               remaining bits in the low byte are reserved and set to
               zero.

               The high byte is reserved for device use and will
               always be set to zero for GDI-realized standard fonts.
               Physical fonts with the high-order bit of the low byte
               set may use this byte to describe themselves. GDI will
               never inspect the high byte.

dfPoints       2 bytes specifying the nominal point size at which
               this character set looks best.

dfVertRes      2 bytes specifying the nominal vertical resolution
               (dots-per-inch) at which this character set was
               digitized.

dfHorizRes     2 bytes specifying the nominal horizontal resolution
               (dots-per-inch) at which this character set was
               digitized.

dfAscent       2 bytes specifying the distance from the top of a
               character definition cell to the baseline of the
               typographical font. It is useful for aligning the
               baselines of fonts of different heights.

</PRE>dfInternalLeading
<PRE>               Specifies the amount of leading inside the bounds set
               by dfPixHeight. Accent marks may occur in this area.
               This may be zero at the designer's option.

</PRE>dfExternalLeading
<PRE>               Specifies the amount of extra leading that the designer
               requests the application add between rows. Since this
               area is outside of the font proper, it contains no
               marks and will not be altered by text output calls in
               either the OPAQUE or TRANSPARENT mode. This may be zero
               at the designer's option.

dfItalic       1 (one) byte specifying whether or not the character
               definition data represent an italic font. The low-order
               bit is 1 if the flag is set. All the other bits are
               zero.

dfUnderline    1 byte specifying whether or not the character
               definition data represent an underlined font. The
               low-order bit is 1 if the flag is set. All the other
               bits are 0 (zero).

dfStrikeOut    1 byte specifying whether or not the character
               definition data represent a struckout font. The low-
               order bit is 1 if the flag is set. All the other bits
               are zero.

dfWeight       2 bytes specifying the weight of the characters in the
               character definition data, on a scale of 1 to 1000. A
               dfWeight of 400 specifies a regular weight.

dfCharSet      1 byte specifying the character set defined by this
               font.

dfPixWidth     2 bytes. For vector fonts, specifies the width of the
               grid on which the font was digitized. For raster fonts,
               if dfPixWidth is nonzero, it represents the width for
               all the characters in the bitmap; if it is zero, the
               font has variable width characters whose widths are
               specified in the dfCharTable array.

dfPixHeight    2 bytes specifying the height of the character bitmap
               (raster fonts), or the height of the grid on which a
               vector font was digitized.

</PRE>dfPitchAndFamily
<PRE>               Specifies the pitch and font family. The low bit is set
               if the font is variable pitch. The high four bits give
               the family name of the font. Font families describe in
               a general way the look of a font. They are intended for
               specifying fonts when the exact face name desired is
               not available. The families are as follows:

                  Family               Description
                  ------               -----------
                  FF_DONTCARE (0&lt;&lt;4)   Don't care or don't know.
                  FF_ROMAN (1&lt;&lt;4)      Proportionally spaced fonts
                                       with serifs.
                  FF_SWISS (2&lt;&lt;4)      Proportionally spaced fonts
                                       without serifs.
                  FF_MODERN (3&lt;&lt;4)     Fixed-pitch fonts.
                  FF_SCRIPT (4&lt;&lt;4)
                  FF_DECORATIVE (5&lt;&lt;4)


dfAvgWidth     2 bytes specifying the width of characters in the font.
               For fixed-pitch fonts, this is the same as dfPixWidth.
               For variable-pitch fonts, this is the width of the
               character "X."

dfMaxWidth     2 bytes specifying the maximum pixel width of any
               character in the font. For fixed-pitch fonts, this is
               simply dfPixWidth.

dfFirstChar    1 byte specifying the first character code defined by
               this font. Character definitions are stored only for
               the characters actually present in a font. Therefore,
               use this field when calculating indexes into either
               dfBits or dfCharOffset.

dfLastChar     1 byte specifying the last character code defined by
               this font. Note that all the characters with codes
               between dfFirstChar and dfLastChar must be present in
               the font character definitions.

</PRE>dfDefaultChar  1 byte specifying the character to substitute
<PRE>               whenever a string contains a character out of the
               range. The character is given relative to dfFirstChar
               so that dfDefaultChar is the actual value of the
               character, less dfFirstChar. The dfDefaultChar should
               indicate a special character that is not a space.

dfBreakChar    1 byte specifying the character that will define word
               breaks. This character defines word breaks for word
               wrapping and word spacing justification. The character
               is given relative to dfFirstChar so that dfBreakChar is
               the actual value of the character, less that of
               dfFirstChar. The dfBreakChar is normally (32 -
               dfFirstChar), which is an ASCII space.

dfWidthBytes   2 bytes specifying the number of bytes in each row of
               the bitmap. This is always even, so that the rows start
               on WORD boundaries. For vector fonts, this field has no
               meaning.

dfDevice       4 bytes specifying the offset in the file to the string
               giving the device name. For a generic font, this value
               is zero.

dfFace         4 bytes specifying the offset in the file to the
               null-terminated string that names the face.

</PRE>dfBitsPointer  4 bytes specifying the absolute machine address of
<PRE>               the bitmap. This is set by GDI at load time. The
               dfBitsPointer is guaranteed to be even.

dfBitsOffset   4 bytes specifying the offset in the file to the
               beginning of the bitmap information. If the 04H bit in
               the dfType is set, then dfBitsOffset is an absolute
               address of the bitmap (probably in ROM).

               For raster fonts, dfBitsOffset points to a sequence of
               bytes that make up the bitmap of the font, whose height
               is the height of the font, and whose width is the sum
               of the widths of the characters in the font rounded up
               to the next WORD boundary.

               For vector fonts, it points to a string of bytes or
               words (depending on the size of the grid on which the
               font was digitized) that specify the strokes for each
               character of the font. The dfBitsOffset field must be
               even.

dfReserved     1 byte, not used.

dfFlags        4 bytes specifying the bits flags, which are additional
               flags that define the format of the Glyph bitmap, as
               follows:

               DFF_FIXED            equ  0001h ; font is fixed pitch
               DFF_PROPORTIONAL     equ  0002h ; font is proportional
                                               ; pitch
               DFF_ABCFIXED         equ  0004h ; font is an ABC fixed
                                               ; font
               DFF_ABCPROPORTIONAL  equ  0008h ; font is an ABC pro-
                                               ; portional font
               DFF_1COLOR           equ  0010h ; font is one color
               DFF_16COLOR          equ  0020h ; font is 16 color
               DFF_256COLOR         equ  0040h ; font is 256 color
               DFF_RGBCOLOR         equ  0080h ; font is RGB color

dfAspace       2 bytes specifying the global A space, if any. The
               dfAspace is the distance from the current position to
               the left edge of the bitmap.

dfBspace       2 bytes specifying the global B space, if any. The
               dfBspace is the width of the character.

dfCspace       2 bytes specifying the global C space, if any. The
               dfCspace is the distance from the right edge of the
               bitmap to the new current position. The increment of a
               character is the sum of the three spaces. These apply
               to all glyphs and is the case for DFF_ABCFIXED.

</PRE>dfColorPointer
<PRE>               4 bytes specifying the offset to the color table for
               color fonts, if any. The format of the bits is similar
               to a DIB, but without the header. That is, the
               characters are not split up into disjoint bytes.
               Instead, they are left intact. If no color table is
               needed, this entry is NULL.
               [NOTE: This information is different from that in the
               hard-copy Developer's Notes and reflects a correction.]

dfReserved1    16 bytes, not used.
               [NOTE: This information is different from that in the
               hard-copy Developer's Notes and reflects a correction.]

dfCharTable    For raster fonts, the CharTable is an array of entries
               each consisting of two 2-byte WORDs for Windows 2.x and
               three 2-byte WORDs for Windows 3.0. The first WORD of
               each entry is the character width. The second WORD of
               each entry is the byte offset from the beginning of the
               FONTINFO structure to the character bitmap. For Windows
               3.0, the second and third WORDs are used for the
               offset.

               There is one extra entry at the end of this table that
               describes an absolute-space character. This entry
               corresponds to a character that is guaranteed to be
               blank; this character is not part of the normal
               character set.

               The number of entries in the table is calculated as
               ((dfLastChar - dfFirstChar) + 2). This includes a
               spare, the sentinel offset mentioned in the following
               paragraph.

               For fixed-pitch vector fonts, each 2-byte entry in this
               array specifies the offset from the start of the bitmap
               to the beginning of the string of stroke specification
               units for the character. The number of bytes or WORDs
               to be used for a particular character is calculated by
               subtracting its entry from the next one, so that there
               is a sentinel at the end of the array of values.

               For proportionally spaced vector fonts, each 4-byte
               entry is divided into two 2-byte fields. The first
               field gives the starting offset from the start of the
               bitmap of the character strokes. The second field gives
               the pixel width of the character.

&lt;facename&gt;     An ASCII character string specifying the name of the
               font face. The size of this field is the length of the
               string plus a NULL terminator.

&lt;devicename&gt;   An ASCII character string specifying the name of the
               device if this font file is for a specific device. The
               size of this field is the length of the string plus a
               NULL terminator.

&lt;bitmaps&gt;      This field contains the character bitmap definitions.
               Each character is stored as a contiguous set of bytes.
               (In the old font format, this was not the case.)

               The first byte contains the first 8 bits of the first
               scanline (that is, the top line of the character). The
               second byte contains the first 8 bits of the second
               scanline. This continues until a first "column" is
               completely defined.

               The following byte contains the next 8 bits of the
               first scanline, padded with zeros on the right if
               necessary (and so on, down through the second
               "column"). If the glyph is quite narrow, each scanline
               is covered by 1 byte, with bits set to zero as
               necessary for padding. If the glyph is very wide, a
               third or even fourth set of bytes can be present.

                  NOTE: The character bitmaps must be stored
                  contiguously and arranged in ascending order.

               The following is a single-character example, in which
               are given the bytes for a 12 x 14 pixel character, as
               shown here schematically.

                  ............

               The bytes are given here in two sets, because the
               character is less than 17 pixels wide.

                  00 06 09 10 20 20 20 3F 20 20 20 00 00 00
                  00 00 00 80 40 40 40 C0 40 40 40 00 00 00

               Note that in the second set of bytes, the second digit
               of each is always zero. It would correspond to the 13th
               through 16th pixels on the right side of the character,
               if they were present.


</PRE>The Windows 2.x version of dfCharTable has a GlyphEntry structure with
the following format:
<P>
<PRE>GlyphEntry    struc
geWidth       dw     ?    ; width of character bitmap in pixels
geOffset      dw     ?    ; pointer to the bits
GlyphEntry    ends

</PRE>The Windows 3.0 version of the dfCharTable is dependent on the format
of the Glyph bitmap.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: The only formats supported in Windows 3.0 will be DFF_FIXED
   and DFF_PROPORTIONAL.

</PRE>DFF_FIXED
DFF_PROPORTIONAL
<P>
<PRE>GlyphEntry    struc
geWidth       dw     ?    ; width of character bitmap in pixels
geOffset      dd     ?    ; pointer to the bits
GlyphEntry    ends

</PRE>DFF_ABCFIXED
DFF_ABCPROPORTIONAL
<P>
<PRE>GlyphEntry    struc
geWidth       dw     ?   ; width of character bitmap in pixels
geOffset      dd     ?   ; pointer to the bits
geAspace      dd     ?   ; A space in fractional pixels (16.16)
geBspace      dd     ?   ; B space in fractional pixels (16.16)
geCspace      dw     ?   ; C space in fractional pixels (16.16)
GlyphEntry    ends

</PRE>The fractional pixels are expressed as a 32-bit signed number with an
implicit binary point between bits 15 and 16. This is referred to as a
16.16 ("sixteen dot sixteen") fixed-point number.
<P>
The ABC spacing here is the same as that defined above. However, here
there are specific sets for each character.
<P>
DFF_1COLOR
DFF_16COLOR
DFF_256COLOR
DFF_RGBCOLOR
<P>
<PRE>GlyphEntry    struc
geWidth       dw     ?   ; width of character bitmap in pixels
geOffset      dd     ?   ; pointer to the bits
geHeight      dw     ?   ; height of character bitmap in pixels
geAspace      dd     ?   ; A space in fractional pixels (16.16)
geBspace      dd     ?   ; B space in fractional pixels (16.16)
geCspace      dd     ?   ; C space in fractional pixels (16.16)
GlyphEntry    ends

</PRE>DFF_1COLOR means 8 pixels per byte
DFF_16COLOR means 2 pixels per byte
DFF_256COLOR means 1 pixel per byte
DFF_RGBCOLOR means RGBquads
