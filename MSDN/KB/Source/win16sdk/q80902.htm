<P>
<P><h3>Application Compatibility Document for Windows 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
Due to the amount of information in this document, it has been broken
into seven pieces. To find all seven pieces of this document and the
Windows 3.1 Compatibility Test checklist, query this knowledge base on
the words:
<P>
<PRE>   prod(winsdk) and 31compattest


                               Printing
                               ========

</PRE>Most of the printing changes can be tested by printing documents from
your application with Windows versions 3.0a and 3.1 and comparing the
output. Try to print documents that represent the types of images your
application is capable of printing. You must test with the printers
listed below; you should try others.

<UL><LI>Postscript
<LI>LaserJet II
<LI>LaserJet III
<LI>Dot matrix
<P>
<P>
</UL><h3>RENAMED PRINTERS</h3>
 
<P>
The printer names have been renamed, and your application could have
problems with an upgrade if your application or documents refer to a
specific printer. For example, if your application explicitly looks
for the printer name "PCL/HP LaserJet," it will no longer find this
name. Note that renaming the printer does not affect soft fonts.
<P>
<P><h3>Test</h3>
 
<P>
Bring a document created with your Windows version 3.0a application to
Windows versions 3.1 and print it. Be sure there are no error messages
and that it prints correctly.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>POSTSCRIPT DRIVER</h3>
 
<P>
The GETEXTENTABLE escape has been removed.
<P>
<P><h3>Test</h3>
 
<P>
Check your application code for this escape.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>UNIVERSAL PRINTER DRIVER</h3>
 
<P>
In Windows version 3.1, with the exception of PostScript and a few
other printer drivers, most printer drivers are based on Universal
Printer Driver technology. This technology provides uniform support
and behavior for drivers in areas such as font mapping, color mapping,
escapes, and ExtDeviceMode and DeviceCapabilities functions. It also
makes DIB support available for dot matrix printers.
<P>
Applications can now rely on the values that the DeviceCapabilities
function returns to design their print dialog.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>PCL 4 DRIVER</h3>
 
<P>
The PCL Driver changed in the following ways:

<UL><LI>Default resolution is 300 DPI for Windows version 3.1. In Windows
   version 3.0, it was 75 DPI.

<LI>The driver no longer requires a separate text band when printing at
   300 DPI if there is enough free memory for a full-page band.

<LI>The driver clips text vertically using the following formula:
<P>
   if (y + lpFont-&gt;dfInternalLeading &lt; rcClip.top
<PRE>          || y &gt;= rcClip.bottom)
      return 0;

</PRE><LI>The driver automatically tracks memory. If you encounter an out-of-
   memory error, be sure you set memory configuration correctly. If
   the memory configuration is correct but the document still
   generates out-of-memory errors (even though it prints under Windows
   version 3.0), please send an electronic copy of the document when
   you return the checklist.

<LI>The following escapes are removed:
<P>
<P><PRE>     EXT_DEVICE_CAPS
     EXTTEXTOUT
     FLUSHOUTPUT
     GETEXTENTABLE
     GETFACENAME
     GETSETPAPERORIENT (New ResetDC function provides
<PRE></PRE>                        the same functionality)
     GETTECHNOLOGY
     SETALLJUSTVALUES

</PRE><LI>The following escapes still exist for compatibility, but we
   recommend that you get the same information by using the
   DeviceCapabilities function:
<P>
<PRE>   Escape                     Replacement
   ------                     -----------

   ENUMPAPERBINS              Use DeviceCapabilities DC_BINNAMES.
   ENUMPAPERMETRICS           Use DeviceCapabilities DC_PAPERS,
                              DC_PAPERSIZE, DC_PAPERNAMES.

</PRE><LI>Printer settings are now saved in the WIN.INI file under the
   [device,port] section instead of under the [driver,port] section.
   For example, the WIN.INI file may now contain a [HP LaserJet
   IIP,LPT1] setting instead of [HPPCL,LPT1]. This implies that more
   than one printer within a driver can be connected to the same port
   at the same time while each retains its own settings.

<LI>A new [PrinterAliases] section in WIN.INI supports custom printer
   names.

<LI>The installation of HP/PCL soft fonts and external cartridges
   doesn't change -- the information is still saved under the
   [driver,port] section. Thus, if you install a soft font on LPT1,
   all HP laser printers connected to LPT1: see this soft font.

<LI>In Windows version 3.0, the HPPCL.DRV has GDI simulate a bold
   typeface for a device font if a bold version is not available; the
   Windows version 3.1 driver does not.
<P>
<P>
</UL>Applications that rely on the Windows version 3.0 driver always to
enumerate the first full-page text band and subsequent graphics bands
should remove this dependency. The Windows version 3.1 driver can put
text into graphics bands and can put graphics into the first band.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>OTHER DOT-MATRIX PRINTER DRIVERS</h3>
 
<P>
Dot-matrix drivers changed as follows:

<UL><LI>Printable regions increased on many dot-matrix drivers.

<LI>Color support added for Fujitsu and NEC drivers

<LI>Some resolutions changed on some drivers. Removed "odd" aspect
   ratios and put in closer to one aspect ratios. For example,
   NEC24.DRV changed 60 x 180 to 120 x 180.

<LI>Because of black-and-white printer driver dependency on the screen,
   some changes may be the result of screen driver changes.
<P>
</UL>Applications should test for color DIB printing using a color driver.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>                       Other Core Enhancements
                       =======================

</PRE>Most core enhancements affect applications only if they make
assumptions about internal structures or internal operations. Most of
the testing for this section involves looking at the changes and
reviewing the code for your application. Below is a list of the things
you need to look for.

<UL><LI>An application making assumptions about internal data structures.

<LI>An application building its own selectors.

<LI>Press CTRL+ALT+DEL while your application is running. Be sure
   windows continues to function after your application terminates.
<P>
</UL>There are the following changes:

<UL><LI>Structure of kernel internal memory objects has changed.
   Applications that made assumptions regarding these internal
   structures will most likely be broken. TOOLHELP.DLL has been added
   to Windows version 3.1, which provides a documented interface for
   accessing internal data.

<LI>Kernel now runs at ring 3 (instead of ring 1 as in Windows version
   3.0) to prevent ill-behaved applications from relying on the
   relationship between handles and selectors. This does not affect
   the IOPL (input/output privilege level) of applications and
   drivers.

<LI>GP-fault cleanup. If one application GP faults, Windows cleans up
   its internal state and allows the system to continue running after
   terminating that application.

<LI>Local CTRL+ALT+DEL. Users can kill a single Windows-based application or
   a single VM by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL. The rest of the system should
   continue running.

<LI>Dr. Watson and continue button. Dr. Watson is included but not
   installed by default. If the user installs Dr. Watson, this
   application reports and logs data on application error. For some GP
   faults, Dr. Watson gives the user the option to continue running
   the application, resetting the IP to the instruction following the
   GP fault. Pressing the continue button bypasses GP faults until the
   next task switch.

<LI>Real mode is removed.

<LI>We correctly reflect floating-point exceptions to virtual mode,
   allowing applications that use their own floating-point packages to
   work correctly. Kernel correctly saves and restores the state of
   floating-point interrupt functions, allowing WIN87EM.DLL to coexist
   with other floating-point emulators.

<LI>UMB mechanisms defined for XMS are supported, allowing software
   such as EMM386, 386MAX, and QEMM to load networks and other devices
   in HIMEM. Windows is fully backward compatible with versions 5.x and
   6.x of QEMM and 386MAX.

                             ============

</PRE></UL>Windows version 3.1 includes a new high performance disk cache.
Applications should test with this disk cache enabled (Setup enables
this by default) to ensure that no side effects occur.
<P>
<P><h3>Tests</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Read files from disk.

<P><LI>Write files to disk.

<P><LI>If your application uses the floppy drive or can read and write
   files to the floppy drive, try those operations with caching
   enabled on the floppy.
