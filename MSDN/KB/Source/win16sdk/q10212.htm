<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The term "region" is used throughout the Windows documentation; however,
the term is not defined. This article explains regions, how they are used,
and how a region is defined or specified.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Unlike most graphics packages that can manipulate only simple geometric
structures (usually rectilinear), The Windows graphics device interface
(GDI) has the unique ability to gather an arbitrary set of spatially
coherent points into a structure called a region, and perform complex yet
rapid manipulations and calculations on such structures. This feature not
only makes standard programs simpler and faster, it also allows operations
to be performed that would otherwise be nearly impossible (for example, it
is fundamental to the implementation of the Windows user interface).
<P>
Although most GDI function parameters are given in logical units and then
are converted to device units, region function parameters are given in
device units.
<P>
A region is defined by defining lines, shapes (such as rectangles and
ellipses), or other regions. The outline of a region should be one or
more closed loops. A region can be concave or convex, can consist of
one area or many disjoint areas, and can have "holes" in the middle.
<P>
Many calculations can be performed on regions. For example, given any
two regions, GDI can find their union, intersection, difference, and
exclusive. There is a set of graphic operations on regions to draw
them on the screen.
<P>
When a region is selected into a device context (DC), a new clipping
area is created. Any graphics sent to that DC will be clipped to the
region created. Regions are defined using CreateRectRgn(),
CreateEllipticRgn(), and CreatePolygonRgn().
