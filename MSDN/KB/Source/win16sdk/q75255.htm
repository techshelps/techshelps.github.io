The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.1 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
In a version of Windows that is enabled for double-byte character sets
(DBCS), all functions that take strings as arguments will work with
strings of double-byte characters. In addition, any version of Windows
that supports DBCS will support the IsDBCSLeadByte function. This
function determines whether or not a byte is the leading byte of a
2-byte character. The Windows functions that use a string length
parameter (like lstrlen and TextOut) will use a count of bytes,
not of characters. The functions IsDBCSLeadByte, AnsiPrev, and
AnsiNext should be used to access characters within a string.
<P>
Note that DBCS-enabled Windows will typically have special methods to
enter double-byte or composite characters. Composite character
creation involves pressing several keys in a specified sequence to
form new characters. The entry system is integrated into Windows by
the original equipment manufacturer (hardware OEM). These characters
are not typically directly entered into an edit control. Composite
characters may be entered at the bottom of dialog box (as in OS/2). In
many systems, these characters are composed at the bottom of the
screen (in the composition window).
<P>
Copies of Windows version 3.0 developed for the United States and
Europe do not support DBCS. Copies of Windows version 3.1 developed
for the United States and Europe, and the KANJI adaptation of Windows
version 3.0 and 3.1 do support DBCS. The KANJI adaptation of Windows is
distributed through hardware OEMs. For more information on KANJI
Windows, search this knowledge base on the following words:

</PRE>The March, 1990, "Microsoft Systems Journal" article "Using the OS/2
National Language Support Services to Write International Programs"
has more information on both DBCS and KANJI. It can be found in the
Software/Data Library by searching on OS2NLS or S12547. OS2NLS was
archived using the PKware file-compression utility.
