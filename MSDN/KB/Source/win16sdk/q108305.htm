The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) included with:
   - Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0
   - Microsoft Windows 95 version 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows Telephony application programming interface (TAPI) provides a
way for a TAPI application to handle calls that are initially unknown to
the application and/or the Telephony service provider via the
LINECALLPARAMFLAGS_IDLE flag when invoking lineMakeCall. In an analog
telephone environment, lineGetNewCalls can't provide this functionality for
reasons explained below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A user might manually place a call on a telephone, and then start up his or
her computer to send or receive a fax on the same call. A TAPI application
has to invoke lineMakeCall to create a call appearance. Normally, an
implementation of lineMakeCall checks to see if the line is already in use
before it places the call. In an implementation through a modem (such as
the sample service provider supplied with the TAPI SDK: ATSP), the service
provider does this normally by going off-hook and listening for a dial
tone. However, if the application is breaking into a call that already
exists on a line, the service provider does not want to listen for the dial
tone first--it won't hear it. Additionally, the service provider shouldn't
return LINEERR_CALLUNAVAIL because the line is in use.
<P>
To handle this situation, TAPI provides the LINECALLPARAMFLAGS_IDLE flag.
If the application wants to break into an existing call on the line (not a
call known to TAPI but a call that TAPI was not previously aware of), then
it will turn off the _IDLE bit. Conversely, if the application wants the
provider to start with a "fresh" call (that is, a call with a dial tone),
it will set the LINECALLPARAMFLAGS_IDLE bit.
<P>
In the case of analog devices, the service provider and TAPI are unaware of
the call until lineMakeCall is invoked--lineGetNewCalls cannot be used to
get a handle to the call; the call exists, but the software environment is
not being synchronized with the "real" environment.
<P>
In the digital PBX case, when TSPI_lineOpen is called, the service provider
may be able to ask the hardware (phone or switch) about existing calls, and
immediately establish these in TAPI by sending a LINE_NEWCALL message and a
LINE_CALLSTATE message for each call, showing them as already being in the
CONNECTED state; TAPI would give these calls to the highest-priority
application with the specified media mode. There would be no need to call
lineMakeCall to create a handle to the call, because the provider could do
it spontaneously.
