<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The common dialog boxes library (COMMDLG.DLL) provides a standard set of
dialog boxes for applications developed for the Microsoft Windows graphical
environment. The text below lists errors in the online and printed
documentation for the common dialog boxes DLL in the Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit (SDK).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>"Programmer's Reference, Volume 1: Overview"</h3>
 
<P>
On page 132, in the "Common Dialog Box Overview" topic, change the
"NAME cd" statement to list the name in uppercase letters (NAME CD).
<P>
On page 157, in the "Customizing Common Dialog Boxes" topic, change
the "NAME cd" statement to list the name in uppercase letters (NAME
CD).
<P>
On page 158, a table lists the template filenames and their corresponding
dialog boxes. Add a note to state that these dialog boxes are defined in
the DLGS.H file. The only exception is the ChooseColor() dialog box, which
is defined in the COLORDLG.H file.
<P>
<P><h3>"Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions"</h3>
 
<P>
On page 49, the list of errors that the ChooseColor() function can return
is incorrect. Remove the CDERR_INITIALIZATION, CDERR_MEMALLOCFAILURE, and
CDERR_MEMLOCKFAILURE errors from the list and add the CDERR_DIALOGFAILURE
error to the list.
<P>
On page 51, add the following comment to the documentation for the
ChooseFont() function:
<P>
<PRE>   When the user selects the Show Only TrueType Fonts In
   Applications option in the Control Panel Fonts application, the
   Font dialog box shows only TrueType fonts.

</PRE>On page 52, the list of errors that the ChooseFont() function can return
is incorrect. Remove the CDERR_INITIALIZATION and CDERR_MEMLOCKFAILURE
errors from the list and add the CDERR_DIALOGFAILURE error to the
list.
<P>
On page 63, add the statement #include &lt;cderr.h&gt; to the documentation
for the CommDlgExtendedError() function. This topic does not mention
that the CDERR.H header file defines the error codes for this
function.
<P>
On page 306, in the documentation for the FindText() function, add the
following comment to the discussion of the lpfr parameter:
<P>
<PRE>   The FINDREPLACE structure must be remain in memory after calling
   the FindText function because the Find Text dialog box is
   modeless.

</PRE>On page 307, the list of errors the FindText() function can return is
incorrect. Remove the CDERR_INITIALIZATION, CDERR_MEMALLOCFAILURE, and
CDERR_MEMLOCKFAILURE errors from the error list and add the
CDERR_REGISTERMSGFAIL error to the list.
<P>
On page 308, the code example that documents the FindText() function
declares a local copy of the FINDREPLACE data structure without the
"static" keyword. An application must store this structure in memory
that persists after calling FindText(). This memory can be a global
variable, a static local variable, or a dynamically allocated memory block.
<P>
On page 413, the list of errors the GetOpenFileName() function can
return is incorrect. Remove the CDERR_INITIALIZATION and
CDERR_MEMLOCKFAILURE errors from the error list and add the
CDERR_DIALOGFAILURE error to the list.
<P>
On page 435, the list of errors the GetSaveFileName() function can
return is incorrect. Remove the CDERR_INITIALIZATION and
CDERR_MEMLOCKFAILURE errors from the list and add the
CDERR_DIALOGFAILURE error to the list.
<P>
On page 752, the list of errors the PrintDlg() function can return is
incorrect. Remove the CDERR_INITIALIZATION error from the list and add
the CDERR_DIALOGFAILURE error to the list.
<P>
The Print dialog box appears in the online help for the PrintDlg()
function. If a check box appears in the lower-right corner without any
accompanying text, that check box is the Collate Copies box.
<P>
On page 788, in the documentation for the ReplaceText() function, add
the following comment to the discussion of the lpfr parameter:
<P>
<PRE>   The FINDREPLACE structure must remain in memory after calling
   the ReplaceText function since the Replace Text dialog box is
   modeless.

</PRE>On page 789, the list of errors the ReplaceText() function can return is
incorrect. Remove the CDERR_INITIALIZATION, CDERR_MEMALLOCFAILURE, and
CDERR_MEMLOCKFAILURE errors from the list and add CDERR_REGISTERMSGFAIL to
the list.
<P>
On page 789, the code example that documents the ReplaceText() function
declares a local copy of the FINDREPLACE data structure with the
"static" keyword. However, the online documentation omits this
keyword. An application must store this structure in memory that
persists after calling the FindText function. This memory can be a
global variable, a static local variable, or a dynamically allocated
memory block.
<P>
<P><h3>"Programmer's Reference, Volume 3: Messages, Structures, and Macros"</h3>
 
<P>
On page 246, add the following comment to the documentation for the
CHOOSEFONT data structure:
<P>
<PRE>   When the user selects the Show Only TrueType Fonts In
   Applications option in the Control Panel Fonts application, the
   Font dialog box shows only TrueType fonts.

</PRE>On page 247, add a comment to the documentation for the CF_APPLY flag
to note that a hook function is required to process a notification
from this button. When the user presses the button, the hook function
receives a WM_COMMAND message with wParam == psh3 (a constant defined
in the DLGS.H header file).
<P>
On page 248, the documentation for the CF_NOFACESEL flag refers to
"multiple font selections." This flag indicates that the selected text
is heterogeneous; some text in the selection is formatted with one
font, some with another font.
<P>
On page 248, the documentation for the CF_NOSIZESEL flag refers to
"multiple size selections." This flag indicates that the selected text
is heterogeneous; some text in the selection is formatted in one size,
some in another size.
<P>
On page 248, the documentation for the CF_NOSTYLESEL flag refers to
"multiple style selections." This flag indicates that the selected
text is heterogeneous; some text in the selection is formatted in one
style, some in another style.
<P>
On page 249, add a comment to the documentation for the
CF_SCALABLEONLY flag to indicate that the application must specify a
value in the hDC member of the CHOOSEFONT structure for the Font
dialog box to display printer fonts.
<P>
On page 251, change the documentation for the nFontType member to
indicate that the high-order byte of this member contains one or more
of the values in the accompanying table. The low-order byte is
reserved for use by Windows.
<P>
On page 286, the overview paragraph in the documentation for the
FINDREPLACE data structure states: "After the user chooses the OK
button to close the dialog box, the system returns information about
the user's selections in this structure." This statement is incorrect
because neither the Find nor the Replace dialog box has an OK button.
Substitute "Find Next" for "OK."
<P>
On page 287, the documentation for the FR_DOWN flag states: "After the
user chooses the OK button to close the dialog box, this flag
specifies the user's selection." This statement is incorrect because
the Find dialog box does not have an OK button. Substitute "Find Next"
button for "OK," and add a comment to indicate that FR_DOWN flag
applies only to the Find dialog box.
<P>
On page 288, in the documentation for the FR_HIDEUPDOWN and the
FR_NOUPDOWN flags, add a comment to indicate that these flags apply
only to the Find dialog box.
<P>
On page 289, in the documentation for the lpstrReplaceWith member, add
a comment to indicate that this member applies only to the Replace
dialog box and that the application-supplied buffer should be at least
80 characters long.
<P>
On page 289, in the documentation for the wReplaceWithLen member, add
a comment to indicate that this member applies only to the Replace
dialog box.
<P>
On page 375, in the documentation for the lpstrCustomFilter member of
the OPENFILENAME data structure, add a comment to indicate that an
application can use the lpstrCustomFilter member to specify one
additional filter. The description of this member incorrectly states
that "The system copies the strings to the buffer when the user
chooses the OK button to close the dialog box." This statement should
say that the system copies the last-selected search filter from the
List Files As Type combo box into the buffer to which this member
points. The online Help file contains additional text (not present in
the printed manual) that correctly describes this process.
<P>
On page 376, in the documentation for the lpstrFile member, add a
comment to note that this member takes precedence over the
lpstrCustomFilter member. In other words, if lpstrFile is not blank,
the File Name edit control shows its contents.
<P>
On page 376, the documentation for the lpstrInitialDir member contains
the following statement: "If the lpstrFile member contains a string
that specifies a valid path, the common dialog box procedure will use
the path specified by this string instead of the path specified by the
string to which lpstrInitialDir points." To eliminate any confusion,
replace the phrase "this string" with "the lpstrFile string."
<P>
On page 378, in the documentation for the OFN_NOCHANGEDIR flag, change
its documentation to state that this flag forces the dialog box to
change to the current directory. The common Open dialog box procedure
stores the current directory when it processes the WM_INITDIALOG
message and restores the current directory when the dialog box exits.
<P>
On page 394, in the documentation for the hDevMode and hDevNames
members of the PRINTDLG structure, add a comment to indicate that the
application that calls the PrintDlg function must call GlobalFree()
to free the memory associated with these handles.
<P>
On page 395, add a comment to the documentation for the hDC member to
indicate that the application must call the DeleteDC function in order
to free the device context specified in this member.
