The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows 80386 debugger, WDEB386, provided with the
Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) is automatically made
available by the installation process; however, additional procedures
may be needed to take full advantage of the features it provides. This
article describes the procedures necessary to fully configure this
protected-mode debugger.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Hardware</h3>
 
<P>
A terminal connected to a COM port is required to use WDEB386. Unlike
Microsoft CodeView for Windows (CVW), WDEB386 does not support running
the debugger on a secondary monitor. Optionally, attach a second
computer to a COM port on the primary computer. Running the Windows
Terminal application on the second machine allows you to save and
print portions of debug traces and memory dumps.
<P>
Use the /C:n option (where n is 1 or 2) to specify which COM port to
use with WDEB386. WDEB386 sends all output to the specified COM port.
However, if the debugging version of WIN386.EXE (explained below) is
run without running WDEB386, output is directed by default to COM1.
<P>
<P><h3>Related Files</h3>
 
<P>
Because of the similarity of the names of a number of files, there is
some confusion as to what the debugger is and how to install and use
it. The following list describes some files that have similar names,
but completely different functions.
<P>
WDEB386.EXE  - This file is the actual WDEB386 debugger. The debugger
<PRE>               is described in more detail in Chapter 5 of the
               "Programming Tools" manual distributed with the Windows
               SDK version 3.1 and in Chapter 9 of the "Tools" manual
               distributed with the Windows SDK version 3.0.

WIN386.EXE   - This executable file comprises the core of the Windows
               enhanced-mode operating system layer. It includes the
               VMM (virtual machine manager), and various standard
               VxDs (virtual devices).

</PRE>WINDEBUG.386 - This VxD may be installed in Windows running in
<PRE>               enhanced mode (it is not included in WIN386.EXE). It
               provides a number of low-level services for debuggers,
               the most well-known being the ability to use the key
               combination CTRL+ALT+SYS RQ as a break request. This
               VxD is not necessary for WDEB386 to function properly.

</PRE>By default, the WDEB386.EXE file is installed in the C:\WINDEV
directory, which makes it available in the MS-DOS PATH environment
variable. The WINDEBUG.386 file is also installed during the SDK
installation process. The file itself is copied to the Windows system
directory (by default, C:\WINDEV\SYSTEM), and the line
"DEVICE=WINDEBUG.386" is added to the [386enh] section in the
SYSTEM.INI file. Therefore, these modules should require no special
attention regarding their installation.
<P>
<P><h3>WIN386.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
Special care may be required concerning WIN386.EXE. The retail version
of this file is part of Windows, and Windows does not run in enhanced
mode without it. To take advantage of some of the more advanced and
extremely useful features of WDEB386, however, the debugging version
of WIN386.EXE must first be installed. This step is optional, but
without it, a significant number of WDEB386 commands are not
available.
<P>
Most programmers are aware of the procedure to install "the debugging
version of Windows." This procedure is not sufficient to install the
debugging version of WIN386.EXE. The difference is that the debugging
version of Windows consists of the debugging versions of the kernel,
user, and GDI modules, along with their corresponding symbol files.
These files are all available as part of the SDK. In contrast, the
debugging version of WIN386.EXE is available only as part of the
Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK) in the 386\TOOLS\DEBUG
directory. (Under Windows 3.0, the file is in the DDK VXD\TOOLS\DEBUG
directory.)
<P>
Therefore, even after installing the debugging version of Windows, an
additional action is required to install the debugging version of
WIN386.EXE. Installing WIN386.EXE is easy. Copy the retail version of
WIN386.EXE to a different filename and copy the debugging version from
the DDK disks into the Windows system directory. The retail version
has a file size of around 500K bytes, whereas the debugging version is
significantly larger.
<P>
NOTE: The SYM file for the debugging version of WIN386.EXE is not
available. There is a WIN386.SYM file supplied on the DDK in the same
directory as the debugging version of WIN386.EXE, but this file
contains the symbols for the retail version, and does not contain
symbol information that matches the accompanying EXE file. Attempting
to use this SYM file is worse than not using one at all because it
assigns labels to addresses incorrectly.
<P>
<P><h3>The Grabber</h3>
 
<P>
Once the debugging version of WIN386.EXE is installed, it may also be
necessary to install the debugging version of the "grabber" file. To
determine if the debugging grabber is required, start the debugging
Windows system in enhanced mode and attempt to start an MS-DOS
session. If the attempt fails with the message "Incorrect System
Version," then it is necessary to build and install the debugging
version of the 386 grabber. This should be in the \386\GRABBER
directory in the DDK (under Windows 3.0, this file is in the
\VXD\GRABBER directory). Set the DEBUG flag in the makefile, build the
grabber with the MAKE utility, and copy the grabber to the Windows
system directory. You can change the name of the file, however, the
"386grabber=" line in the SYSTEM.INI file must reflect the correct
name. If it is possible to start an MS-DOS session on the Windows
debugging system while running in enhanced mode, then this step has
been completed successfully.
<P>
<P><h3>Starting the Debugger</h3>
 
<P>
During the process of testing the grabber, you should see a number of
messages written to the COM1 terminal by Windows. These messages
indicate that the debugging version of WIN386.EXE has been correctly
installed, and that the system is ready for the debugger. At this
point, refer to Chapter 5 of the "Programming Tools" manual (or
Chapter 9 of the "Tools" manual) for instructions on starting and
using the debugger. For some tips on using the WDEB386 debugger, query
