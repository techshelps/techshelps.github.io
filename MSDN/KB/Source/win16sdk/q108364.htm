</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
While running an application that has been compiled under debug mode, with
the DBWIN application running, the system may beep continuously causing the
computer to hang. This can happen when running the debug version of an
executable file in the debugger, or by just executing it.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
DBWIN uses an edit control for its output window. An edit box is limited to
approximately 32K total data. If this limit is exceeded, the system will
beep each time a new message is received by DBWIN. Depending on the
settings of the AFX.INI file, the messages sent can include TRACE messages,
main windows messages, WM_COMMANDS, and OLE (object linking and embedding)
trace messages.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are several possible solutions:

<UL><LI>Instead of sending the output to the DBWIN window, the output can be
   directed to a monochrome monitor, which requires a monochrome adapter
   card and monitor installed on your system, or to a terminal connected
   to either COM1 or COM2 of the system.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If the DBWIN application is set to output the DBWIN information to the
   window and then the DBWIN application is shut down, the debug output is
   instead sent to the output window of the Visual Workbench, which does
   not have the 32K limit.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The SYSTEM.INI file can be set so that the debug output is directed to a
   file rather then to the debug window. The entry in the file should be
<P>
<P><PRE>      [debug]
      OutPutTo=&lt;filename&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where filename is the full path of the file to which the debug output
   will be written. If there is not a debug section in your SYSTEM.INI file
   then you must add it.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Microsoft Windows SDK,
version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The source code for DBWIN is included as a sample in the Windows Software
Development Kit (SDK). It can be found under \MSVC\SAMPLES\DBWIN.
