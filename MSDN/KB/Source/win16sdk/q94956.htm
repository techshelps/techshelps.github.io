<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.1 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows version 3.1 Software Development Kit (SDK) "Programmer's
Reference, Volume 2: Functions" lists most of the error codes for a
WinExec() or LoadModule() call; however, this list is not complete.
This article details the error codes that are either deleted, added,
or not documented in the SDK documentation. A complete list of the
error codes is presented at the end of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The WinExec() function is used to start an application whether or not the
application is based on Windows from within a Windows-based application.
The value returned from WinExec() is greater than 32 (or HINSTANCE_ERROR)
if the execution is successful; otherwise, the value returned is an error
code.
<P>
The Windows 3.1 SDK "Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions" documents
the WinExec() application programming interface (API) on pages 983-984 and
lists most of the error codes. This list of WinExec() error codes is
updated from the Windows version 3.0 SDK "Reference, Volume 1." Some of the
error codes are removed from Windows 3.0 because they no longer apply, and
some new error codes are added.
<P>
<P><h3>Deleted Error Codes</h3>
 
<P>
For example, the error codes that are deleted from the Windows 3.1
documentation include the following:
<P>
<PRE>   17   Attempt was made in large-frame EMS mode to load a second instance
        of an application that links to certain nonshareable DLLs that are
        already in use.

   18   Attempt was made in real mode to load an application marked for
        use in protected mode only.

</PRE>These error codes are eliminated from the Windows 3.1 documentation because
either they cannot occur or real mode does not exist in Windows 3.1. These
values must be considered, however, for applications that run in both
Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Added Error Codes</h3>
 
<P>
The error codes that are added to Windows 3.1 documentation include the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   8    There was insufficient memory to start the application.

   19   Attempt was made to load a compressed executable file. The
        file must be decompressed before it can be loaded.

   20   Dynamic-link library (DLL) file was invalid. One of the DLLs
        required to run this application was corrupt.

   21   Application requires Microsoft Windows 32-bit extensions.

</PRE>If an application wants to use error codes 19, 20, and 21 and still
run under Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1, then version-checking must be
done in the application.
<P>
<P><h3>Missing Error Codes</h3>
 
<P>
The error codes that are missing from the Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1
documentation include:
<P>
<PRE>   1    Call to MS-DOS Int 21 Function 4B00h was invalid (impossible
        condition in Windows).

   4    Too many files open.

   7    There were MS-DOS Memory block problems (impossible condition in
        Windows).

   9    There were MS-DOS Memory block problems (impossible condition in
        Windows).

</PRE>Windows 3.1 does not document error codes 1, 7, and 9 because these values
occur only under MS-DOS and not in Windows. Thus they pertain only to MS-
DOS.
<P>
Error codes above 21 under Windows 3.1 and error codes above 18 under
Windows 3.0 are undocumented because they are reserved for future use, and
therefore applications should not use these error codes.
<P>
Because the documentation for WinExec() in the Windows SDK is not complete,
the following table provides the most complete list of the error codes for
the WinExec() function. Note that many of these error codes are the same as
those of the LoadLibrary() function and the MS-DOS call Interrupt 21
function 4B00h, because WinExec() just performs some preprocessing and then
calls Interrupt 21.
<P>
<PRE>   Return                   Meaning
   Value
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

    0       System was out of memory, executable file was corrupt, or
            relocations were invalid.

    1       Call to MS-DOS Int 21 Function 4B00h was invalid
            (impossible condition in Windows).

    2       File was not found.

    3       Path was not found.

    4       Too many files were open.

    5       Attempt was made to dynamically link to a task, or
            there was a sharing or network-protection error.

    6       Library requires separate data segments for each task.

    7       There were MS-DOS Memory block problems
            (impossible condition in Windows).

    8       Insufficient memory to load application.

    9       There were MS-DOS Memory block problems
            (impossible condition in Windows).

   10       Windows version was incorrect.

   11       The .EXE file was invalid. Either it was a non-Windows
            .EXE file or there was an error in the .EXE image.

   12       Application was designed for a different operating system.

   13       Application was designed for MS-DOS 4.0.

   14       The .EXE type was unknown.

   15       Attempt was made in protected mode to load a real mode
            application.

   16       Attempt was made to load a second instance of an .EXE file
            containing multiple, writable data segments.

   17       Attempt was made in large-frame EMS mode to load a second
            instance of an application that links to certain nonshareable
            DLLs that are already in use.

   18       Attempt was made in real mode to load an application marked
            for use in protected mode only.

   19       Attempt was made to load a compressed executable file. The
            file must be decompressed before it can be loaded.

   20       Dynamic-link library (DLL) file was invalid. One of the DLLs
            required to run this application was corrupt.

   21       Application requires Microsoft Windows 32-bit extensions.

   22-31    RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE. NOT RETURNED BY VERSION 3.0.
