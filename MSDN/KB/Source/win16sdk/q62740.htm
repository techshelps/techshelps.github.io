<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The text below discusses methods by which an application for the
Microsoft Windows graphical environment can change the colors
displayed on a display device that does not support a color palette (a
nonpalette device). Specifically, this article discusses selecting 16
nondefault colors for a VGA 16-color driver.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows version 3.0 introduces a set of palette mapping functions that
allow an application to choose what colors are available in the
hardware palette when the application is active. However, these
functions work only with devices that support 256 or more colors, and
have drivers designed for palette support.
<P>
There are some devices that can show a limited number of colors at one
time, but choose those colors from a much larger set of available
colors. For example, the standard VGA screen can display 16 colors at
a time, but can choose those 16 colors from a palette of approximately
256,000 colors. Because it can display only 16 colors at once, the VGA
driver shipped with Windows does not implement the palette functions.
<P>
When an output device has a programmable color palette, its device
driver can implement the SETCOLORTABLE escape through which an
application can specify its desired colors. Note, however, that the
display drivers (EGA, VGA, and so on), which Microsoft ships with
Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1, do not support this escape. A custom
device driver is required to provide this functionality. The
application should send the QUERYESCSUPPORT escape to the driver to
determine whether the escape is supported.
<P>
NOTE: The implementation and use of the SETCOLORTABLE escape in a
display drivers affects all windows that are displayed. Because
changing the color table can adversely affect the appearance of
standard window attributes, such as the caption bar or window frame,
using this functionality is not recommended. SETCOLORTABLE should be
used only after considering how it will affect the user interface for
all applications.
<P>
The Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK) provides sample code and tools
required to create a new device driver, or to modify an existing
device driver to support the SETCOLORTABLE escape.
<P>
Microsoft has also made available a special version of the VGA driver
that implements the SETCOLORTABLE escape. This driver is called
VGAPAL.DRV; it can be found in the Windows Driver Library (WDL), which
is available in the Software Library. For more information on the WDL,
search in the Microsoft Knowledge Base on the following word:
