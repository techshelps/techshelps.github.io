<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
WM_COMMNOTIFY messages with CN_RECEIVE notifications are enabled when
EnableCommNotification() is called with any number but -1 in the
cbWriteNotify parameter. CN_TRANSMIT notifications are enabled when
the cbOutQueue parameter is any number but -1. The CN_RECEIVE
notifications are generated when either the number of characters in
the receive queue exceeds cbWriteNotify, or a time-out occurs.
Similarly, CN_TRANSMIT notifications are generated when the number of
characters in the output queue drops below the cbOutQueue parameter.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the COMM.DRV is loaded, it calls CreateSystemTimer() to create a
100 millisecond timer. When the timer goes off, COMM.DRV loops through
all open ports, and does the "time-out check." The timer period is not
configurable.
<P>
A CN_RECEIVE notification is generated if at receive interrupt time
the following are true:

<UL><LI>CN_RECEIVE notification is enabled.

<LI>The number of characters in the receive queue exceeds cbWriteNotify.

<LI>The number of characters in the receive queue has been below
   cbWriteNotify since the last CN_RECEIVE notification.
<P>
   -or-
<P>
</UL>The following are true at time-out check:

<UL><LI>CN_RECEIVE notification is enabled.

<LI>The port has at least one character in its receive queue.

<LI>The number of characters in the receive queue is less than
   cbWriteNotify.

<LI>A time-out CN_RECEIVE has not already been sent since the last
   character arrived at the port.
<P>
</UL>A CN_TRANSMIT notification is generated if at transmit interrupt time
the following are true:

<UL><LI>CN_TRANSMIT notification is enabled.

<LI>The number of characters in the transmit queue is less then
   cbOutQueue.

<LI>The number of character in the transmit queue has been above
   cbOutQueue since the last CN_TRANSMIT notification.
<P>
</UL>The Windows 3.1 Software Development Kit (SDK) documentation for
EnableCommNotification() contains an incorrect sentence in the
comments section:
<P>
<PRE>   Similarly, a WM_COMMNOTIFY message in which the CN_RECEIVE flag is
   set is sent only when the output queue is larger than the number of
   bytes specified in the cbOutQueue parameter.

</PRE>This should be replaced by:
<P>
<PRE>   Similarly, a WM_COMMNOTIFY message in which the CN_TRANSMIT flag is
   set is sent only when the number of bytes in the output queue first
   exceeds and then falls below the number of bytes specified in the
   cbOutQueue parameter.

</PRE>COMM.DRV has a bug that can generate extra CN_RECEIVE or CN_TRANSMIT
notifications. For additional information, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
