<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The MS-DOS protected mode interface (DPMI) specification is available
free of charge by calling Intel Corporation at (800) 548-4725.
International customers can obtain the DPMI Specification by
contacting the Intel sales office that serves their country.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The DPMI specification was defined to allow an MS-DOS program to
access the extended memory provided by a PC architecture computer
while maintaining system protection. DPMI defines a specific subset of
MS-DOS and BIOS calls that can be made by protected mode MS-DOS
programs. It also defines a new interface through software Interrupt
31h, which protected mode programs can use to allocate memory, modify
selectors, call real mode software, and so forth.
<P>
DPMI is commonly used to communicate with a terminate-and-stay-
resident (TSR) program or an MS-DOS device driver from a protected
mode application. If the protected mode application passes a buffer of
data to a TSR or device driver, the application must allocate the
buffer from memory addressed below 1 megabyte to make the data
accessible to the real mode software. The application must also
translate the buffer's address from a selector address to a segment
address. If the real mode software calls back to a function in the
protected mode application, the application must allocate a real mode
callback address. DPMI provides services to perform each of these
tasks.
<P>
The Microsoft Windows standard mode MS-DOS extender and Windows
enhanced mode provide translation services for most of the commonly
used interrupts. This allows a driver or an application to call
MS-DOS, the BIOS, and other common services without using the DPMI.
However, when an application communicates with a network, a TSR, or
any real mode software for which Windows does not provide automatic
translation, it must use DPMI services.
<P>
DPMI services should be used only in a Windows device driver or a
dynamic-link library (DLL). An application should manipulate selectors
using the kernel selector functions, documented in the Microsoft
Windows Software Development Kit (SDK). Calling DPMI services from an
application may not be supported by future versions of Windows.
However, calling these services from a device driver or a DLL will be
supported.
