<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Windows environment, banding is a common technique to
divide a page into a number of sections, called bands. When an
application uses banding, it requires less memory to produce a page of
printed output at the potential expense of some additional time. This
article discusses the four types of banding devices that can be used
in the Windows environment: nonbanding devices, simple banding
devices, "Full Page Banding for Text" devices, and BANDINFO devices.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Nonbanding Devices</h3>
 
<P>
These devices do not perform any banding. PostScript printers and
plotters are the most common nonbanding devices. These nonraster
devices accept primitive output directly from Windows without any need
for intermediate rasterization. An application can identify a
nonbanding device by performing the following three steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a device context (DC) for the output device and obtain a
   handle to the device context (hDC).

<P><LI>Call the GetDeviceCaps function, specifying the hDC and RASTERCAPS
   for the iCapability parameter.

<P><LI>Check the RC_BANDING bit of the GetDeviceCaps function. If the
   RC_BANDING bit of the GetDeviceCaps return value is clear, the
   device does not perform banding.
<P>
</OL><h3>Simple Banding Devices</h3>
 
<P>
These devices divide both text and graphics into a series of bands
starting at the top of each page and running to the bottom. Under
versions of Windows earlier than 3.1, these devices may provide a
full-page band when available memory permits, but they usually do not.
Under Windows 3.1, these devices generally provide a full-page band
when memory permits. Dot-matrix printers are the most common simple
banding devices. An application can identify a simple banding device
by performing steps 1 and 2 above. The RC_BANDING bit is set for
simple banding devices.
<P>
<P><h3>"Full Page Banding for Text" Devices</h3>
 
<P>
The driver for a page printer (commonly referred to as a laser
printer) typically uses one band covering the full page for text
followed by additional smaller bands for graphics. This technique is
an optimization for a printer that allows text to be placed at any
position on the page but does not have the graphics capabilities of a
PostScript printer. Typically, a driver does not provide any graphics
bands unless it detects a graphics command in its text band. While
this technique allows the driver to optimize printing of pages
containing only text, an application that prints graphics must call a
graphics primitive in the text band to work correctly with this driver
type. Most new page-printer drivers are developed for the fourth
driver category, discussed below.
<P>
<P><h3>BANDINFO Devices</h3>
 
<P>
With a BANDINFO device driver, an application can optimize its
printing and eliminate calling graphics primitives in a text band by
requesting graphics bands only when required and identifying which
band is the text band. This BANDINFO escape provides this capability.
An application issues the BANDINFO escape to inform the driver that
the application will print graphics and to determine which bands
contain text and which bands contain graphics.
<P>
An application can use the QUERYESCSUPPORT escape to identify a device
that supports the BANDINFO escape. If the driver supports BANDINFO,
the application can determine when to print text or graphics as
appropriate. If the driver does not support the BANDINFO escape, the
application should print text and graphics in each band.
<P>
The Hewlett-Packard LaserJet driver is an example of a printer driver
that implements the BANDINFO escape.
