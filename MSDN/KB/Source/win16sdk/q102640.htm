The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows version 3.1
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Running an application in the Microsoft Windows operating environment
may produce a system modal dialog box containing the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Segment Load Failure

</PRE>The error occurs inconsistently due to the cached file handle
mechanism of Windows version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
During the life of a Windows-based application, Windows may need to load
discarded code or resource segments or LOADONCALL segments for the
first time. To load the segment, Windows uses file I/O functions to
read the information from the .EXE file. If Windows has any errors
opening the .EXE file, it will produce the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Segment Load Failure

</PRE>The following are possible reasons opening the .EXE file fails, but this
list is not exhaustive:

<UL><LI>The filename was changed, deleted, or otherwise corrupted since
   the application was first started.

<LI>The .EXE file resides on a shared drive and is opened exclusively or
   in compatibility mode by another workstation running the
   application.

<LI>The .EXE file resides on a shared drive and is opened exclusively or
   in compatibility mode by another application for some purpose other
   than running the .EXE.

<LI>The system has run out of available file handles.
<P>
</UL>The error message may occur inconsistently or not at all due to the
mechanism used by Windows for caching file handles. The .EXE file is
referred to by a file handle. By default, Windows caches 12 file
handles for the most recently used files. If Windows subsequently
opens more files than what the cache can hold, the cache closes the
least recently used file handles. The error does not occur if Windows
uses a cached file handle to refer to the file, but will occur if the
file handle is no longer in the cache.
<P>
The file handle cache is a system-wide mechanism and not a
per-application mechanism. The number of cached file handles can be
changed by the CachedFileHandles switch in the [boot] section of the
SYSTEM.INI file. For more information regarding CachedFileHandles, see
the SYSINI.WRI file in the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit.
