<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The README.TXT file in the \MSVC\MFC directory shipped with Visual C++
version 1.5 is a duplicate of the README.TXT file in the \MSVC\MFC\SRC
directory.
<P>
The correct file is included with Visual C++ version 1.51.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The \MSVC\MFC subdirectory contains the source code and sample code for the
Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library version 2.5.
<P>
The contents of the MFC subdirectory are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   \INCLUDE
      This directory contains MFC 2.5 header files, inline function
      definitions, resource definitions, help contexts, and
      resource IDs. These files are used by both the MFC 2.5 source
      code and by applications built using MFC 2.5.

   \LIB
      This directory contains the static link libraries for MFC 2.5
      and the import libraries for the shared DLLs. If you decide
      to build custom variants of the MFC 2.5 libraries, they will
      be placed in this directory as well.

   \SAMPLES
      This directory contains all of the MFC 2.5 sample
      applications. There is an "MFC Samples Help" program item in
      Visual C++ group in Program Manager which can be used to get
      the descriptions of all the sample applications and any
      information required to build them. A Program Manager group
      named "MFC Samples on CDROM" is also available to run the
      samples.

      The batch file MKSAMPLE.BAT also is provided for building most
      of the samples in one step from the command line. Before
      running this batch file, be sure to correctly set up your
      INCLUDE and LIB environment variables. To set up your
      environment variable, run the file MSVCVARS.BAT in the
      \MSVC\BIN directory. Three of the sample applications must
      be built by hand because they require variants of the MFC
      2.5 library that are not built by the installation. Refer to
      "MFC Samples Help" program item in the Visual C++ group in
      Program Manager for more information.

   \SRC
      This directory contains the source code for the Microsoft
      Foundation Classes version 2.5. There is a README.TXT in
      this subdirectory that describes the specifics involved in
      building MFC 2.5 library variants. A file called MAKEFILE is
      supplied to build MFC 2.5 library variants.

      In addition, in this directory are several binary files
      used to build MFC 2.5. Three static link libraries
      (.LIB files) that have the implementation of VBX controls
      are also contained in this directory. Six module definition
      files for rebuilding the MFC 2.5 shared DLLs are included
      as well.
