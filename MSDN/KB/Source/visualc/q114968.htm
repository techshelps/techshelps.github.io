The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, and 4.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Books Online may start slowly because its index file must be read
from the CD-ROM drive. CD-ROM drives are usually much slower than hard
drives. By putting part or all of the help files on your hard drive, you
can decrease the time you spend waiting for Books Online to access
information.
<P>
In the Setup of Visual C++ version 4.0, there are three options: leave
all Books Online files on the CD, the CD-ROM installation; copy just the
Books Online indices and some relatively small help file to the hard
drive, the Typical installation; or, copy all Books Online files to the
hard drive, a Custom installation that includes at least the Microsoft
Developer Studio and the Books Online. The Typical installation is the
default.
<P>
In Visual C++ version 2.x, the Setup program provides similar options:
keeping all of the help on the distribution CD, copying just the indices
to the hard drive, or copying all of the help files in their entirety to
the hard drive. Copying just the indices is the default action.
<P>
The Setup for Visual C++ 32-bit edition version 1.0 does not afford
these options. The remainder of this article explains how to place part
or all of the online help onto a hardrive for Visual C++ 32-bit edition
version 1.0.
<P>
This article assumes you are familiar with the registry editor, REGEDT32.
For more information, type "start REGEDT32" at a command prompt and view
the online help for the utility.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT keeps track of the locations of the Books Online files in the
registry. Using the REGEDT32 registry editor, you can change these registry
entries to allow you to keep the books that you access most frequently on
your local drive.
<P>
It is recommended that any help files moved from the CD are located in a
single directory, such as "MSVCNT\HELP", for simplicity.
<P>
All of the registry references
have the root registry path of:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\
      Software\
      Microsoft\
      Viewer

</PRE>Make the following changes in the registry:

<OL><P><LI>Change BOOKSONL\Path to refer to the location of the BOOKS.HDX and
   BOOKS.IND files. The .HDX index file allows the Books Online Viewer to
   start up while the .IND file is used in the Search Plus help file
   option.

<P><LI>Change VCXXBKS1\Path to refer to the location of VCXXBKS1.HLP. Books
   listed before the "C++ Language Reference" in the viewer window are
   included in this help file.

<P><LI>Change VCXXBKS2\Path to refer to the location of the VCXXBKS2.HLP file.
   All books in the viewer window that are not in VCXXBKS1.HLP are in this
   help file.

<P><LI>Change SDKBKS\Path to refer to SDKBKS.HLP. This help file contains
   all five volumes of the "Win32 Programmer's Reference."
<P>
</OL>Note that Visual C++ 2.0 and later also have entries in similar places to
hold Books Online information in the registry.
<P>
<PRE> HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Viewer
 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Visual C++ 2.0

</PRE></OL>You can change these entries individually to place the most used portions
of the Books online on your hard drive if you wish, but this will require
that you experiment on your own.  Microsoft does not directly support
custom Books Online configurations past those offered in the Visual C++ 2.0
setup.
