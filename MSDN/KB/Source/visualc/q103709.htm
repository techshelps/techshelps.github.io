<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Running Setup creates a message box titled
<P>
<PRE>   Setup Initialization Error

</PRE>and the message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot access required initialization file

</PRE>The message box contains a STOP icon and an OK button. When you choose
OK, the program ends.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
An incorrect version of LZEXPAND.DLL may cause the problem. The
problem may also be caused by:

<UL><LI>A bad SETUP.EXE program on the installation disks.
<LI>Being unable to create a temporary directory.
<LI>A problem copying files.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Check that the correct version of LZEXPAND.DLL is available and that
other versions do not occur earlier on the dynamic-link library (DLL)
search path.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup program uses the LZEXPAND.DLL file from Windows 3.1 to
decompress files from the installation disks. An incorrect (old)
version of this DLL is the most common reason for Setup to give the
"Cannot access required initialization file" error message. Several
versions of LZEXPAND.DLL have been released, some of them with
particular software packages. These may have installed the DLL in the
Windows directory rather than the Windows SYSTEM directory. Windows
3.1 installs the DLL in the Windows SYSTEM directory (by default,
C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM).
<P>
The Windows 3.1 version of LZEXPAND.DLL is 9,936 bytes and is dated
03/05/92 or later. It contains major changes from earlier versions
shipped with Windows version 3.0 and some other software.
<P>
If multiple copies of LZEXPAND.DLL exist on your system, remove or
rename all except the one in the Windows SYSTEM directory. If the size
and date on that DLL do not seem correct, and the Setup error
persists, expand a new copy of the DLL from either your Windows 3.1
installation disks or from the Visual C++ installation disks. Refer to
the file PACKING.TXT on disk one to determine which disk and directory
contains LZEXPAND.DLL. You can expand the file from the floppy disk by
using the Windows 3.1 EXPAND utility. For example,
<P>
<PRE>   EXPAND  a:\redist\lzexpand.dl  c:\windows\system\lzexpand.dll

</PRE>Other possible, but less common causes of this problem are:

<OL><P><LI>The installation disks have been damaged and SETUP.EXE is corrupt.
   In this case, Setup may run but accesses the files incorrectly. To
   obtain new installation disks, contact Microsoft Customer Service
   at (800) 426-9400. Outside the United States, contact the Microsoft
   subsidiary for your area. To locate your subsidiary, go to the Microsoft
   Web site <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm</A></B> or look in the
   Visual Workbench "User's Guide," pages xix-xxv.

<P><LI>Setup cannot create a required temporary directory and copy files
   to that directory. SETUP.EXE is a bootstrap program that creates a
   \MS-SETUP.TMP directory and copies STFSETUP.EXE, STFSETUP.INF, and
   WSETUP.HLP to that directory. The temporary directory is created on
   the first disk with sufficient space (that is, it checks drive C,
   D, and so forth) until a disk with free space is located). If the
   directory cannot be created, then the root directory is either full
   or write protected. After the files are copied (expanded by the
   LZEXPAND.DLL functions), Setup runs STFSETUP.EXE.
<P>
   An error in copying a file can also cause the "Cannot access
   required initialization file" error. If this problem is suspected,
   ensure that at least one available disk (preferably drive C) does
   not have the root directory write protected, has at least 1
   megabyte (MB) of free disk space, and that a new directory can be
   created at the root.

<P><LI>The Windows SYSTEM directory is not listed on the path. Check the
   path statement to make sure that C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM is listed.
