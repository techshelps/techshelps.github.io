The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation 32 for Windows NT, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a source file is saved while the project is being built, the
relationships between the source file and the .obj file may be incorrect.
The saved source file may have an earlier date than the .obj file that was
created from the previous version of the source file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem of file modify or save time being incorrect is caused by the
Developer's Studio doing front-end processing on all the files before it
creates the .obj files. This makes it possible to save a changed file after
the earlier version was processed but before the .obj file is created.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open one of the files in a project, but don't open the file that will
   be used to create a .pch file (Stdafx.cpp in an MFC application).

<P><LI>Start a Rebuild All.

<P><LI>Introduce a syntax error in the open file, but do not save it.

<P><LI>While the Rebuild All progresses, look in the output window, and wait
   for it to compile the open file.

<P><LI>As soon as it finishes compiling the file, and before it says
   "Generating Code," save the changed file that has a syntax error.
   Because the changes occurred after the front end of the compiler has
   processed the file, there will be no errors in the build. The .obj file
   will however have a later date because it was created in the "Generating
   Code" phase.

<P><LI>Do a Build (not a Rebuild All). Nothing will happen, and the changed
   file will not be compiled.

<P><LI>Look at the dates of the files, and confirm that the .obj file is newer
   than the file that was changed.
