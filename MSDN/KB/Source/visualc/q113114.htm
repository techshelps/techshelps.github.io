The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The App Studio included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0 and 1.5
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 1.0 and 2.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Using App Studio to open a .RC file that has been modified and saved causes
App Studio to generate a General Protection fault in module RCDLL.DLL.
However, App Studio can successfully open .RC files that have not been
modified and saved. Under Visual C++ 2.0, 32-bit Edition, the integrated
environment will GP-fault upon startup.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can be caused by having the system date and time set to
a value which is greater than January 19, 2038, 7:14:07 P.M.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Set the system date and time to the correct values.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed above. We are researching this problem, and will post new
information in the Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The problem has to do with the fact that the C run-time time related
functions use a type of time_t to represent time values. Currently
time_t is defined to be a signed long. The maximum number of seconds
that can be stored in a signed long is 2,147,483,647. Since the time
related functions use 00:00:00 (midnight), January 1, 1970 as their
base, the maximum time and date that can be represented with a time_t
type is January 19, 2038, 3:14:07 A.M.
<P>
Only .RC files which have been modified and saved on a system that is
currently using the incorrect time and date will show the problem. For
example, .RC files which are included with the samples provided with
the compiler can be successfully loaded into App Studio. This is
because their last modification time was set when they were initially
created. However, once a .RC file has been modified and saved on the
system with the invalid time and date, it can no longer be loaded into
App Studio.
