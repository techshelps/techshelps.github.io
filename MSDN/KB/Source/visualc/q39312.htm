<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The C language does not support the use of nested comments. This might
appear to be a limitation in cases where it is necessary, perhaps for
debugging purposes, to comment out a block of code that contains comments.
However, this situation can be overcome by using the much more powerful
preprocessor commands #if and #endif.
<P>
The #if preprocessor command evaluates a constant expression to either true
(which has the value 1) or false (which has the value 0) to perform
conditional compilation. If the expression equates to true, the code
segment will be compiled. If it equates to false, it will be ignored by the
compiler. Therefore, if the syntax below is used, the enclosed block of
code will be forever ignored by the compiler, giving a convenient method of
effectively commenting out a block of code.
<P>
Because the expression in the #if can be any constant expression, you
can make complicated tests. You can even use the /Dconst=value switch
on the CL command line to set a preprocessor symbol that will include
or exclude the debugging code when you compile.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a simple example:
<P>
<PRE>   #define OUT 0

   #if OUT       /* will always equate to "false" */

      /* code and comments that you wish to remove are here */

   #endif

</PRE>In addition to this method, if you are using one of the Microsoft C++
development tools listed above, you can use a simpler technique in new code
where ANSI compliance is not required. This technique relies on the new
single line comment allowed by C++, which Microsoft compilers also allow in
C code. Such code, however is not ANSI standard and will generate a C2143
syntax error on any lines using the // single line comment.
<P>
To allow easy commenting of blocks of code, the rule is to ALWAYS use
single line comments for your source code comments. Since single line
comments can be nested inside standard comments. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   i = x;  // always compile
   /*   printf ("i = %d\n",i);  // debug only
   */

</PRE>This technique, of course, does not allow compile-time decisions about what
to include as the #if technique does. However, it is very convenient when
making changes to the code or trying to find a bug by removing non-
essential statements.
