The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The AppWizard included with:
   Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.5, 1.51 and 1.52
   Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0 and 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
AppWizard generates code that uses a static UINT array called "buttons" to
associate command IDs to a single toolbar bitmap that contains several
images for buttons 16 pixels wide and 15 pixels high. The IDs are
associated with the toolbar buttons, based on their order in the array.
<P>
When you construct a full-server or mini-server OLE application using
AppWizard and you have not selected context-sensitive Help support, the
"buttons" array used by the application's in-place frame window class will
contain one less command ID than the toolbar contains buttons. This
behavior is by design. The image for the Help mode button is included in
the toolbar bitmap, even when the application is generated without context-
sensitive Help support.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To view this behavior, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start AppWizard and choose full-server or mini-server for the
   application by selecting OLE Options from the main AppWizard dialog
   box.

<P><LI>Have AppWizard create the application.

<P><LI>Open App Studio, and, if you have a full-server application, open the
   bitmap with the ID "IDR_xxxxxxTYPE_SRVR_IP", where xxxxxx is the
   first six letters of your project. For example, if the project is
   named "EXAMPLE", the bitmap would be "IDR_EXAMPLTYPE_SRVR_IP". If you
   have a mini-server application, the bitmap would have the ID
   "IDR_SRVR_INPLACE".

<P><LI>Open the file IPFRAME.CPP in Visual C++. Find the variable named
   "buttons". Count how many IDs are there besides the ID_SEPARATOR IDs.
   This would normally be equal to the number of button images that
   appear on the toolbar bitmap, but in this situation they are not
   equal.

<P><LI>Now count how many button images are in the bitmap. There will be one
   more image than there are IDs (not including ID_SEPARATOR IDs). In a
   default application created by AppWizard, there will be four IDs and
   five button images.
<P>
</OL>You need to be aware of this behavior if you decide to add buttons to the
toolbar for the in-place frame window class. If the application does not
support context-sensitive Help or the Help mode button, the button image
could simply be replaced with the new button. If context-sensitive Help
will be part of the application, then you need to make sure the command IDs
that you add correspond to the correct button image. Otherwise, the buttons
will not operate the way you expect them to operate.
