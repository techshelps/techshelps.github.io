The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Custom AppWizard included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Currently there is no support for manipulating project settings with a
Custom AppWizard. Default settings are automatically used based on the
type of application that the Custom AppWizard is based on, such as a
console application, or an MFC application.
<P>
When constructing a Custom AppWizard that creates projects requiring
additional libraries, it is necessary to add these libraries to your
base project's link options. The problem is that creating a Custom
AppWizard based on this base project, will not carry these custom link
options over to the Custom AppWizard or the projects that this Custom
AppWizard will generate.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this limitation, you can add a pragma to one of the base
project's header files to automatically link the project with a specific
library. The pragma takes the following form:
<P>
<PRE>   #pragma comment(lib, libname)

</PRE>This places a library-search record in the object file. The libname
parameter is the filename (and optionally the path) of the library you want
the linker to search. Because the library name precedes the default library-
search records in the object file, the linker searches for this library
just as if you had named it on the command line. You can place multiple
library-search records in the same source file; each record appears in the
object file in the same order in which it is encountered in the source
file.
<P>
This technique is identical to the technique used by MFC to link different
types of MFC applications to the proper MFC libraries.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>

comment(lib, libname), query the Visual C++ Online Documentation using the
following keywords:
