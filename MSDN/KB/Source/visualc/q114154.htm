The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Due to the recent ruling in the court case regarding the DoubleSpace
technology Microsoft was using in MS-DOS (and other products), Microsoft is
taking the conservative position of removing this technology from all
products which use it. For more information on all products affected please
see the press release issued February 23, 1994 below.
<P>
Visual C++ 1.5 for Windows was slightly effected by this ruling since it
includes the MSQuery tool. This tool allows you to connect to different
databases using ODBC drivers. In this tool there is a help system which
uses Cue Cards to provide the user with information. These Cue Cards were
compressed using the same technology that is in DoubleSpace.
<P>
Visual C++ 1.5 for Windows has been re-released to manufacturing with no
change in functionality with the compression technology removed. We will
not be updating the version number of the Visual C++ box. Instead, just the
version number of the Cue Card DLL has been updated to 2.00.
<P>
<P>
If you are already using a Visual C++ 1.5 for Windows that contains the
older version of Cue Cards, it is NOT legally necessary for you to stop
using that version for any reason. Currently, we have no plans to exchange
products or recall packages already released to the public.
<P>

This is a copy of the press release Microsoft issued on February 23, 1994
regarding the court ruling in the compression technology case between
Microsoft and Stac Electronics.

<P><h3>February 23, 1994 Press Release</h3>
 
<P>
Jury Finds Patent Infringement by Microsoft and Trade Secret
Misappropriation by STAC
<P>
<PRE>   REDMOND, Wash. - Feb. 23, 1994 - Microsoft Corporation said it
</PRE>will seek to overturn the patent-infringement portion of today's
jury verdict in the complex patent and trade-secret dispute with
STAC* Electronics.  A seven-person jury decided that Microsoft's
DoubleSpace* disk-compression utility in its Microsoft* MS-DOS* 6
operating system infringes two STAC data-compression patents and
awarded STAC $120 million in compensatory damages.
<P>
The jury also found that STAC had misappropriated and used in its
Stacker* products Microsoft's trade secret preloading feature and
awarded Microsoft $13.7 million in compensatory plus punitive
damages.
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft said it expects STAC to seek an injunction against
</PRE>Microsoft as part of the judgment, preventing the company from
selling any additional product containing the DoubleSpace disk-
compression technology.  Microsoft will oppose any such injunction
and will seek an injunction against STAC and its licensees to prevent
them from selling any products containing the preloading feature.
Judge Edward Rafeedie of the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, who
presided over the trial, will consider these issues and enter a
judgment reflecting his determination of appropriate injunctive
relief.
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft said it will also file immediately after the entry of
</PRE>the judgment a motion to overturn the patent-infringement portion
of the verdict.  If its motion is not granted, Microsoft intends to
appeal the judgment to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, the federal appellate court that reviews all patent
judgments.
<P>
<PRE>   "While we are disappointed with the jury's patent verdict, we
</PRE>believe that the evidence and the law are on our side," said Bill
Neukom, senior vice president of law and corporate affairs at
Microsoft.  "Microsoft reiterates that it believes that its
DoubleSpace utility in MS-DOS 6 does not infringe either of STAC's
patents.  We took extreme care, both technically and legally, to
ensure that the commercial MS-DOS product did not infringe either of
those patents.  We are gratified that the jury found that STAC had
stolen our trade secrets, which protect the fundamental design of
MS-DOS.  We will pursue all appropriate legal means to overturn the
patent verdict and protect the trade-secret verdict."
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft will accrue the full amount of the damages verdict.
</PRE>This one-time charge will reduce Microsoft's third fiscal quarter
earnings per share by 26 cents.
<P>
<PRE>   "It is important that existing customers understand that they may
</PRE>continue to use their MS-DOS products.  This verdict does not affect
them," said Paul Maritz, senior vice president of Microsoft's systems
division. "Customers buying new product will be able to get MS-DOS
with its many advanced features, but without the DoubleSpace utility."
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft said that it does not anticipate any material disruption
</PRE>of the supply of its MS-DOS product.  Microsoft will promptly supply
to its OEM customers and its retail channel resellers versions of
MS-DOS that will not include the DoubleSpace utility.
<P>
<PRE>   Founded in 1975, Microsoft (NASDAQ "MSFT") is the worldwide leader
</PRE>in software for personal computers.  The company offers a wide range
of products and services for business and personal use, each designed
with the mission of making it easier and more enjoyable for people to
take advantage of the full power of personal computing every day.
