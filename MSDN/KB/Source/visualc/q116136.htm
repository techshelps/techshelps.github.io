The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The AppWizard included with:
   Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
AppWizard fails to create a new project if extended characters are used as
part of the project name. AppWizard accepts the project name, but generates
the following message box:

<UL><LI>The file 'C:\_\|.mak' does not exist.
   Would you like to create it?
<P>
</UL>If the user chooses "Yes," the Visual Workbench creates a new project, but
does not create the AppWizard-generated files. The directory C:\_ is also
created, and it is difficult to delete.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with AppWizard, version 1.0.
The problem was corrected with AppWizard, version 1.5, supplied with Visual
C++ for Windows, version 1.5.
<P>
This problem does not occur with AppWizard, version 1.0, supplied with
Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 1.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is difficult to reproduce this problem using the United States keyboard
layout. To reproduce the problem, you can use the Swedish keyboard layout
and country setting or any other keyboard layout that uses extended
characters. To change the keyboard layout and country setting, open Control
Panel and run the International applet. Consult your "Windows User's Guide"
for more information.
<P>
Once your keyboard layout and country setting have been changed, perform
the following steps to re-create this problem:
<P>
WARNING: This procedure may create several subdirectories on the hard drive
that are difficult to eliminate. Do not perform these steps unless it is
absolutely necessary.

<OL><P><LI>Create a subdirectory that you can delete later; name it "TEST".

<P><LI>Start Visual C++.

<P><LI>Select AppWizard from the Project menu.

<P><LI>Choose the TEST directory for the project path. With the keyboard layout
   set to Swedish, this generates an "a-umlaut" character (an "a" with two
   dots on top of it). AppWizard tries to create a subdirectory called
   "a-umlaut" as well.

<P><LI>Choose the "OK" button, then select Create from the next dialog box. The
   AppWizard dialog box disappears, followed by the message box saying
   "C:\TEST\_\|.MAK does not exist...".

<P><LI>Delete the TEST directory and its contents because it is no longer
   needed.
<P></OL>
