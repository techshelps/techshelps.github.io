The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Visual Workbench included with:
   Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, and 1.52
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
On occasion, you may need to access components of the Microsoft Visual C++
from a remote network connection. Even though Visual C++ was not designed
for access from a network server, you can use the Visual Workbench from a
remote workstation that has Microsoft Windows, version 3.1 or later,
installed.
<P>
The information below has been tested on only a few systems. You may need
to modify the setup shown below for some installations.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft Visual C++ was not developed as a network shared
application. The information provided below has been tested minimally and
may not be complete; it may be necessary to place additional files on a
writable disk. Visual C++ is licensed on a single-user basis. A validly
licensed copy of Microsoft Visual C++ is required for each computer that
uses the product as outlined below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To run Visual C++ from a read-only network drive or a CD-ROM, you must
have a writable directory that contains certain .EXE and .DLL files.
<P>
In addition, your SYSTEM.INI file contain entries that enable the
Visual Workbench to properly initialize itself. The following lines
must appear in the [386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   WinExclusive=0
   device=*vmcpd
   device=&lt;path&gt;dosxnt.386
   device=&lt;path&gt;mmd.386
   device=&lt;path&gt;cvw1.386

</PRE>Replace &lt;path&gt; with the complete drive and directory path to the
location of the .386 device files. These files may be on a read-only
drive. The CVW1.386 device is provided with the Professional Edition
and is required only if you use CodeView for Windows.
<P>
You must be sure that no other line in the SYSTEM.INI file loads
another device file with the same name. One example is DOSXNT.386, a
component of both the Microsoft Macro Assembler, version 6.1, and of
Microsoft Visual C++, version 1.0. If more than one line specifies a
device, Windows fails on initialization and returns the user to the MS-
DOS prompt.
<P>
The easiest method to add the correct entries to your SYSTEM.INI file
involves running the Visual C++ Setup program with the /F switch.
Doing so creates a SYSTEM.INI file and a Visual C++ program group, but
it does not copy any files from the installation disks. To use the /F
switch, choose Run from the Program Manager File menu, enter "setup
/F" (without quotation marks) in the Command Line field of the Run
dialog box, and choose OK. The /F switch must be capitalized. After
you run Setup, edit your SYSTEM.INI file to specify the correct path
for the installed devices and modify the properties of the program
icons to specify the correct path. (To change the property of an icon
in Program Manager, select the icon, then choose Properties from the
File menu.) Because the MSVC.EXE file must be installed on a writable
disk, the Visual C++ icon will be different from the path to the other
applications. The /F switch for versions 1.51 and 1.52 apply to the SETUP
program that is located in the \msvc15 directory only.
<P>
Some files must be installed into your Windows and Windows system
directories (by default, C:\WINDOWS and C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM,
respectively). The .INI files must be on a writable drive. These files
are listed below.
<P>
When you first run the Visual Workbench (MSVC.EXE) from the writable
disk, you must specify the directories that MSVC searches for various
files. Choose Directories from the Options menu and enter appropriate
values. The first entry in the Executable Files Path parameter must be
a drive and directory on a writable disk followed by the MSVC\BIN
directory on the read-only disk.
<P>
The following files must be installed on a writable disk:
<P>
<PRE>   MFCAPPWZ.EXE
   MSVC.EXE
   WINTEER.EXE
   CLONEDBG.DLL
   CVWIN.DLL

   MFC200D.DLL (MFC250D.DLL in versions 1.5 and later)
   MFC200D.SYM (MFC250D.SYM in versions 1.5 and later)

</PRE>The following files must be installed in the Windows directory (by
default, C:\WINDOWS):
<P>
<PRE>   MSVC.INI
