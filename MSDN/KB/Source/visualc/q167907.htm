<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are some limitations when you use the Access ODBC Driver in multi-
threaded applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Versions of the Access ODBC driver that shipped with versions 4.2 and
earlier of Visual C++ (or as version 3.0 of the desktop drivers) has
limitations when you use it in multithreaded applications. You cannot pass
connection and statement handle values from one thread to another. This
also means that CDatabase and CRecordset MFC objects cannot be shared
between threads.
<P>
The reason for this is that the Jet database engine utilized VBA, which
supports the Apartment Model of thread safety rather than free-thread
safety. Although the Access ODBC Driver, internally, put a critical section
around every call to the Jet engine, the use of VBA made the sharing of
connection and statement handles unsafe. As long as the thread in the
application that initiated a connection to the Access Driver is the only
one that does work on that connection, everything is fine. However, it is
not safe to pass the connection handle onto another thread and have that
thread do work on that connection.
<P>
The multithreaded capabilities of the desktop drivers that ship with Visual
C++ 5.0 (or as version 3.5 of the desktop drivers) have improved. It is now
safe to share connection handles between threads. However, the thread that
creates the connection must also free it. It is still not safe to share
statement handles. This means that it is safe to share CDatabase objects
but not CRecordset objects.
