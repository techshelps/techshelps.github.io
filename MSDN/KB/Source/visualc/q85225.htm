<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.0 and 1.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The /Oq switch tells the compiler to generate packed code (p-code).
After the p-code program is linked, the Make P-Code utility (MPC) must
be used to make the program runnable. If MPC is not used on the p-code
program, depending on the program type and the host environment,
different error messages will be displayed when the program is
executed.
<P>
NOTE: In Microsoft C/C++ Compiler version 8.0, the linker automatically
detects when you are creating a p-code application and automatically runs
MPC.EXE. This means that there is no need to use the /PCODE linker switch
or to separately run MPC.EXE.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Attempting to run an MS-DOS p-code executable that hasn't had MPC used
on it may cause MS-DOS to display the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program cannot be run in DOS mode.

</PRE>A Windows-based application that has been compiled with the /Oq option but
that hasn't had MPC used on it generates an unrecoverable application
error (UAE) under Windows 3.0 and an application error under Windows 3.1.
<P>
Attempting to load a Windows dynamic-link library (DLL) that has been
compiled into p-code but that has not had MPC run on it, can cause
various problems ranging from UAEs to system hangs.
<P>
To make sure that a p-code executable or DLL is runnable, do one of
the following:

<UL><LI>Compile and link in one step.
<P>
   If the /Oq option is specified without the /c option, the CL driver
   will automatically invoke MPC after the link has been completed.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Link with the /PCODE option.
<P>
   If the compile and link are done as separate steps, the /PCODE
   option can be used to tell the linker to invoke MPC after the link
   has completed.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Run MPC manually.
<P>
   MPC can be used directly on the executable or DLL that was created
   by the linker.
<P>
</UL>For more information on p-code and controlling the p-code build process,
refer to the online help on MPC and to Chapter 3 of the "Microsoft C/C++
Programming Techniques" manual supplied with Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0.
<P>
NOTE: If a Windows p-code application that has not had MPC used on it
is run under MS-DOS, the following standard message will be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   This program requires Microsoft Windows.
