<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes which components of the Microsoft Windows 3.1
Software Development Kit (SDK) were included with C/C++ 7.0 that are not
included with the Professional Edition of Visual C++ 1.0. For a description
of differences between the Professional and Standard Editions of Visual
C++, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : VC++ 1.0 Standard vs. Professional Editions

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Professional Edition of Visual C++ includes everything from the SDK
that shipped with C/C++ version 7.0, with the following exceptions:

<UL><LI>The Dialog Editor (DLGEDIT.EXE) and Image Editor (IMAGEDIT.EXE) are not
   included. The functionality of both of these tools is provided by App
   Studio in Visual C++.

<LI>CodeView for Windows (CVW) version 3.07 is not included. An updated
   version of CVW, version 4.1, is shipped with Visual C++.

<LI>The LIBENTRY.ASM and LIBENTRY.OBJ files used for building dynamic-link
   libraries (DLLs) are not included. Code that provides the same
   functionality is included in the Visual C++ DLL (dynamic-link library)
   run-time library. This is mentioned in the README.WRI file shipped with
   Visual C++.

<LI>None of the SDK help files in QuickHelp format are included because
   QuickHelp (QH.EXE) is not shipped with Visual C++. All of the SDK help
   files are included in WinHelp format.

<LI>The Setup Toolkit is not included.

<LI>The RAINBOW sample is not included although it is described in the
   online help for the SDK samples. This is mentioned in the README.WRI
   file shipped with Visual C++.

<LI>The following text files are not included:
<P>
<P><PRE>      README.SDK
      WINDOWS.TXT
      ROBUST.TXT
      WINDOWSX.TXT
</PRE><P>
</UL>The information from some of these files is incorporated into the online
help provided with Visual C++.
