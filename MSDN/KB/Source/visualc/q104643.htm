The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
Phar Lap Software has created a patch for its MS-DOS extender
"DOSXNT.EXE" that allows the command-line tools, such as CL, LINK,
CVPACK, BSCMAKE, and NMAKE, which are included with Visual C++ for
Windows, to run in an MS-DOS box under OS/2 2.1. DOSXNT does not allow
the Visual Workbench to be run under OS/2 because OS/2 doesn't provide
enhanced mode Windows support for Visual Workbench's build engine,
which is a requirement. Visual C++ still targets only MS-DOS and
Windows, and does not target OS/2.
<P>
Microsoft Developer Support provides support on the usage of the
command-line tools but cannot address any OS/2-specific issues.
Because the compiler has not been extensively tested under OS/2, it is
highly recommended that if a problem with the tools occurs under OS/2,
it should be duplicated under MS-DOS before Microsoft Developer
Support is contacted.
<P>
The patch provided by Phar Lap Software does not represent a
commitment from Microsoft that future language products will be able
to run under OS/2.
<P>
This patch is available through a ZIP file OS2FIX.ZIP put together by
Phar Lap Software in cooperation with Microsoft. The file can be
downloaded from the following locations:

<UL><LI>Phar Lap's BBS (617) 661-1009 (2400/9600, 8 data, no parity, 1 stop)
<LI>Phar Lap's FTP site ftp.pharlap.com (login anonymous) in /PUB/DOSXNT
<P>
</UL>For more information on the patch, see the READ.ME file in OS2FIX.ZIP.
