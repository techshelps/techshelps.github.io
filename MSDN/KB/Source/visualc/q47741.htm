The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The C Run-time (CRT), included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft C for MS-DOS, versions 5.1, 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0ax
    - Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS, version 7.0
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0 and 1.5
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Due to a limitation of MS-DOS, the handles stdaux and stdprn cannot be
closed in order to open additional files before hitting the limit of
the FILES= parameter in CONFIG.SYS.
<P>
To open a file using the C run time, ALL of the following conditions
must be true:

<OL><P><LI>There must be a space in the C run-time library's internal file
   tables. This is normally limited to 20 files, but this limit can be
   increased by modifying the startup code if you're using MS-DOS 3.30
   or later.

<P><LI>There must be MS-DOS file handles available to your particular
   process. Again, the normal limit is 20, but this can be increased
   with a call to function 67h of INT 21h (only under MS-DOS 3.30 or
   later). This can also be modified in the startup code.

<P><LI>Finally, there must be files available from MS-DOS's system-wide
   pool, as set by FILES= in CONFIG.SYS. (This defaults to 8, but can
   be set as high as 20 under MS-DOS version 3.30 and earlier or 255
   under versions 3.30 and later.)
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The results of comparing a C program that uses the C run-time library
and a MASM program that calls MS-DOS directly are shown below. Each
was run with stdprn and stdaux, closed and open.
<P>

   21 (Note 2)        15             17          17            17

</PRE></OL>Please note the following:

<OL><P><LI>The formula for the number of files you can open for FILES=n, where
   n is less than 19, is n - 3.

<P><LI>No matter how high you set FILES=, you'll be limited to these
   numbers in C unless you modify the startup code as described in the
   README.DOC file. In MASM, you'll be limited to these numbers unless
   you raise the per-process limit on file handles by calling INT 21h,
   function 67h.

<P><LI>Running the program from a batch file doesn't change these numbers;
   however, reduce each number by 1 for each input or output
   redirection you do.

<P><LI>The MASM program doesn't get any additional handles freed up when
   it closes handles 3 and 4 because, contrary to what the "MS-DOS
   Encyclopedia" implies, MS-DOS won't allow you to reuse those two
   handles.
<P>
</OL>Without closing handles, C programs give you a constant 15 or n - 3,
whichever is smaller. The upper limit is 15 because, unless you modify
the startup code, the limit is 20 minus the five default files.
<P>
When you close handles 3 and 4, they are closed for C but not for
MS-DOS. Therefore, you can open exactly as many handles as MS-DOS
normally allows.
