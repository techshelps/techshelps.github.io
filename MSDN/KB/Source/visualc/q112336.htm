<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Visual Workbench included with:
   Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Using the Visual WorkBench to build an internal project or to compile a
file may cause the following error message to be generated:
<P>
<PRE>    Internal make: fatal error U1073: don't know how to make
    '&lt;filename&gt;'.

</PRE>&lt;filename&gt; could be the currently loaded file name or the name of any
file that is part of the current project. Loading the project as an
external makefile allows the files in the project to be successfully
compiled. Also, individual source files that show the problem can be
successfully compiled from the command line outside the Visual WorkBench.
<P>
Different symptoms occur with Visual C++ 2.0 and 2.1. For more information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID:<B><A HREF="../VISUALC/Q125494.htm">Q125494</A></B>
   TITLE     :BUG: Visual C++ Gives GP Fault If System Date past
              18-Jan-2038

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can be caused by having the system date and time set to
a value after January 19, 2038, 3:14:07 A.M.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Set the system date and time to the current date and time.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Visual WorkBench version
1.1. This problem was fixed in Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition,
version 4.0
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The problem has to do with the fact that the time-related C run-time
functions use a type of time_t to represent time values. Currently
time_t is defined to be a signed long. The maximum number of seconds
that can be stored in a signed long is 2,147,483,647. Because the time-
related functions use 00:00:00 (midnight), January 1, 1970 as their
base, the maximum time and date that can be represented with a time_t
type is January 19, 2038, 3:14:07 A.M.
<P>
The internal build engine used by the Visual Workbench attempts to
check the last modification time and date when doing a compile or a
build. If the modification time and date are past the January 19, 2038,
3:14:07 A.M. value, the Visual WorkBench generates the U1073 error.
<P>
Only files that have been saved on the system with the incorrect time
and date exhibit this problem. For example, files that are included
with the samples provided with the compiler can be successfully
compiled and built from within the Visual WorkBench. This is because
their last modification time and date was set when they were initially
created. However, once the files have been modified and saved on the
system with the invalid time and date, they can no longer be compiled
from within the Visual WorkBench.
