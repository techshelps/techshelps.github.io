The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Starting the Visual C++ Workbench, version 1.5, with the /V option
under Windows and then choosing the Build or the Rebuild All from the
Project menu may trigger a dialog box with the following text:
<P>
<PRE>   Please enter the path for WINTEE.PIF :

</PRE>Because the WINTEE.PIF file was not created by the Setup program, the
build cannot proceed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
WINTEE.PIF could not be found in the directories specified by the PATH
environment, so the Visual Workbench prompts the user to enter the location
of the file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the user has installed Visual C++, version 1.0, on the machine, then the
WINTEE.PIF file generated for that installation can be copied and used for
the Visual C++ version 1.5 installation.
<P>
If the user does not have Visual C++, version 1.0, installed, then
WINTEE.PIF can be created using the PIFEDIT.EXE utility supplied with
Windows. To do so, the user could invoke PIFEDIT and set the following
fields to the values suggested below:
<P>
<PRE>    Program Filename: C:\MSVC\BIN\WINTEER.EXE
    Window Title: WinTee
    Start-Up Directory: C:\MSVC\BIN
    Memory Requirements: KB Desired: 512
    Display Usage: Windowed
    Execution: Background: On

</PRE>All other fields should be left with their default settings. If Visual C++
was installed in a directory other than the default (C:\MSVC), the
appropriate path should be substituted in the "Program Filename" and "Start-
Up Directory" fields. After setting all fields, save the file under the
name "WINTEE.PIF" in the same directory as the one specified in the "Start-
Up Directory" field.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Visual C++ for Windows, version
1.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WINTEER.EXE is the utility that the Visual Workbench uses to communicate
with the command-line tools during the build process. If the Visual
Workbench is invoked through the /V option, then it runs WINTEER in a
visible window using the WINTEE.PIF file instead of running the WINTEER.EXE
directly. If WINTEE.PIF was not installed by the Setup program, the dialog
appears to prompt the user for the location of the file. However, because
the file was not created by the Setup program, the user will not be able to
build the project.
<P>
NOTE: This is not a problem when Visual C++ runs under the Windows NT
operating system because the WINTEE.PIF file is not used.
