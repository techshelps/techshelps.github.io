The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.50, 1.51, 1.52
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0,

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses how to determine which ODBC and ODBC driver files to
ship with a Visual C++ application that uses the MFC database classes. This
information is more specific than that found in the REDISTRB.WRI file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two categories of files that must be shipped with an application
that uses the MFC database classes:

<UL><LI>The ODBC components.
<LI>The files that make up the ODBC driver(s) that the application uses.
<P>
</UL><h3>ODBC Components</h3>
 
<P>
The set of ODBC components that you need to ship depends on the operating
system supported and on whether the application is a 16-bit or a 32-bit
application. The possible combinations are described in more detail in
Appendix A of the ODBC SDK Guide (ISBN #:1-55615-658-8). The four possible
combinations and their required ODBC component files are:

   ODBC32.DLL         32-bit thunking driver manager
   ODBCCURS.DLL       16-bit cursor library
   ODBC.DLL           16-bit driver manager

   NOTE: The Win32s components are included in the \WIN32S\ODBC
   directory on the Visual C++ version 2.X and 4.X CDs.

   32-bit Application with 32-bit Drivers (Windows NT)
   ---------------------------------------------------

   ODBC32.DLL         32-bit driver manager
   ODBCCR32.DLL       32-bit cursor library
   ODBCCP32.DLL       32-bit installer DLL
   ODBCAD32.EXE       32-bit administrator
   ODBCINST.HLP       installer help file
   CTL3D32.DLL        32-bit ctl3d DLL

</PRE><h3>ODBC Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
The files that make up the different ODBC drivers are not documented
completely in any one place. Because of this lack of documentation and also
because these files are prone to change in the future, a good way to
determine which files are needed to redistribute a particular driver is to
use the ODBC.INF file for the setup program that initially installed the
ODBC driver files. The advantage of using ODBC.INF is that it was actually
used to install the ODBC drivers, therefore it is the source of a tested
and working driver installation. For all versions of Visual C++ that ship
ODBC components and drivers, ODBC.INF is located in the REDIST
subdirectory.
<P>
For example, suppose an application needs to install the Microsoft Access
driver that ships with Visual C++ version 1.52a. In that case, you would
look in the "[Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)]" of the ODBC.INF file. In
this section, you will see a number of entries, one for each file that
makes up the Microsoft Accesss driver. Each entry is on a single line that
consists of comma-separated values. The second value in each line is the
filename for that entry. Here is the first entry for the Microsoft Access
driver section of ODBC.INF:
<P>
"vbajet.dll" = 1, vbajet.dll,,,, 1994-11-18,,,,,,,,,, 1984,,,, 2.0.0.2420,
<P>
In this case, you can see that the filename for this entry is VBAJET.DLL,
so this is one of the files needed to redistribute the Microsoft Access
driver. Another interesting field in this entry is the next to the last one
(2.0.0.2420). This is the version number of the file.
<P>
Going through all the entries in the Microsoft Access driver section, you
can make a list of all the required files:
<P>
<PRE>   VBAJET.DLL
   STDOLE.TLB
   OLE2.REG
   MSJETERR.DLL
   MSJETINT.DLL
   OLE2PROX.DLL
   VAEN2.OLB
   OLE2CONV.DLL
   ODBCTL16.DLL
   COMPOBJ.DLL
   OLE2NLS.DLL
   ODBCJTNW.HLP
   OLE2DISP.DLL
   STORAGE.DLL
   ODBCJET.HLP
   TYPELIB.DLL
   ODBCJT16.DLL
   OLE2.DLL
   VBAR2.DLL
   MSAJT200.DLL

</PRE>NOTE: Many of these files are OLE2 DLLs. It is very important to do version
checking when installing files on a new system. If there are newer versions
of any of these files and you replace them with older versions,
applications that depend on the newer versions may break.
