The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++, Macintosh Cross-Development, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information on availability of ODBC drivers for
Visual C++ Cross-Development Edition for the Macintosh, version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Though Visual C++ Cross-Development Edition for the Macintosh version 4.0
includes support for ODBC, no ODBC drivers shipped with the product. This
was because the ODBC drivers were not available at the time of
manufacturing. This is documented in the README for Visual C++ 4.0.
<P>
<P><h3>From the README</h3>
 
<P>
ODBC Drivers Not Available for Macintosh
<P>
This release does not contain the ODBC drivers for the Visual C++ Cross
Development edition for Macintosh as they are not yet available. We've
provided a fulfillment coupon which entitles you to the shipping ODBC
drivers at no additional charge as soon as they become available. Please
refer to the coupon in your product box for further information regarding
fulfillment.
<P>
<P><h3>When will drivers be available?</h3>
 
<P>
The drivers will be sent out to customers in the United States and Canada
around the end of January 1996.
<P>
<P><h3>How can customers obtain the drivers?</h3>
 
<P>
Customers in the United States and Canada need to send in the fulfillment
coupon for ODBC drivers that included with the product. This is a separate
insert in the box and is titled:
<P>

   Drivers 1.44 MB disk offer.

</PRE>The drivers will be mailed once they are ready to be shipped to customers
who have sent in the fulfillment coupon.
