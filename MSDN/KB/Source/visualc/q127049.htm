The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
   Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.52
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to get a patch to fix the problems discussed
below.
<P>
NOTE: This patch is not needed for the 32-bit MFC classes, version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The CRecordset database class that shipped with Microsoft Visual C++
version 1.52 cannot modify existing databases. There is a conditional
statement in DBCORE.CPP that prevents insertion, addition, or deletion of
records to databases. This can result in an Application Error. DBCORE is a
component of MFCD250.DLL.
<P>
In addition there is a condition in MFC250.DLL that can cause
_afxMsgCache() to call a message handler from a previously run application
that used this dll. This results in calls to functions that are no longer
present and can result in an Application Error.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed these to be problems in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. These two problems are fixed in
MFC252a.EXE. This patch can only be applied to users of MFC version 2.52,
which was released with Visual C++ 1.52. MFC252a.EXE will upgrade the
version resource of MFC250.DLL and MFCD250.DLL to be version 2.52a.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In general, if you are planning to redistribute the MFC250.DLL or
MFCD250.DLL that is version 2.52, you should apply this patch and
redistribute the 2.52a version of the DLLs.
<P>
You can determine if you need this patch by viewing the file properties for
mfc250[d].dll and mfcd250[d].dll with File Manager. If the version is
2.5.200, you should apply the patch. After the patch is applied the version
will be 2.5.200a.
<P>
In order to use the patch, download the file MFC252a.EXE, put it in a
temporary directory, and run the executable. The README.TXT included in
MFC252a.EXE contains more detailed information on the patch contents and it
explains how to apply the patch.
