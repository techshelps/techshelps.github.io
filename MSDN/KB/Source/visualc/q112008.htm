The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Visual Workbench included with:
   Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0 and 1.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An attempt to build an application under Microsoft Visual C++ version 1.0
or version 1.5 may fail. The system may hang, appear to hang, or generate
the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Internal Error: Timed out waiting for "&lt;path&gt;WINTEER.EXE" to
   start. Please contact Microsoft Product Support Services.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
WINTEER.EXE is an application that supports communication between
applications designed for the Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS operating
systems. Because the Visual Workbench runs with Microsoft Windows while the
build tools run with MS-DOS, WINTEER launches tools and returns their
messages to the Workbench. If WINTEER cannot launch a tool or cannot
communicate with the tool, a time-out occurs.
<P>
This error may occur if the WinExclusive parameter in your SYSTEM.INI file
is set incorrectly, or if other errors occur during the build. It may also
occur if the AllVMsExclusive parameter is set to TRUE in SYSTEM.INI, even
though the WinExclusive parameter is set correctly. See the text below or
the README.WRI file for additional information about WINTEER.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This error can occur if the WinExclusive flag is set incorrectly. Your
SYSTEM.INI file should contain a line as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   WinExclusive=0

</PRE>You can use the Microsoft Windows Control Panel to check this value. In
Control Panel, choose 386 Enhanced from the Settings menu. Clear the check
from the Exclusive in Foreground setting if a check is present.
<P>
If the Exclusive In Foreground check box is cleared, change the properties
of the Visual Workbench icon to include the /V option switch (the text
below provides the complete procedure). This switch places the WINTEER
session into a visible window. The text below provides additional Visual
Workbench switches that may help you to debug the error.
<P>
If the computer is on a Novell network, problems could be caused by
a mismatch between the network drivers and the network shell. The network
drivers are loaded in the MS-DOS AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Their version can be
determined by typing "nver" or "netx I" from the MS-DOS command line. The
network shell is part of the Windows configuration. Its version can be
determined by viewing the Windows setup.
<P>
If the problem persists, Visual Workbench may be conflicting with the
installed video driver. Use the Windows Setup program to change the
video driver to one of the default drivers provided with Windows to
determine if the driver is causing the error.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The WinExclusive option determines whether the foreground application
receives all processor time. The parameter is a Boolean value; if it is set
to a nonzero value (ON), no MS-DOS application will run while an
application developed for Windows is in the foreground. Because WINTEER is
designed to run in the background while the Visual Workbench runs in the
foreground, WinExclusive must be zero (OFF). According to the Windows
Resource Kit, the default WinExclusive setting is off.
<P>
Once you have verified that the WinExclusive option is correct, if the
problem persists, edit the program item for the Visual Workbench in
the Visual C++ program group in Program Manager. Perform the following
five steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the Visual C++ icon.

<P><LI>Choose Properties from the File menu.

<P><LI>In the Program Item Properties dialog box, the command line
   contains a command such as:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\MSVC\BIN\MSVC.EXE
</PRE><P>
   (The specific path will be different if you installed to a drive or
   directory other than the default.)

<P><LI>Edit the Command Line property to specify the /V option switch on the
   command line. Given the default command line in step 3 above, the
   command line appears as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\MSVC\BIN\MSVC.EXE /V
</PRE>
</OL></UL><LI>The /V switch creates a window for the WINTEER session.

</UL><OL><P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>If the error persists, the Visual Workbench supports the following options,
which may help to address the problem:
<P>
<PRE>   Option  Purpose
   ------  -------

   /R      Specifies that the Visual Workbench invokes WINTEE instead
           of WINTEER. WINTEE uses memory less effectively, but it may
           demonstrate different behavior than WINTEER.

   /C      Specifies that the Visual Workbench compacts memory before
           it uses any tools. This option can slow execution.

   /M      Specifies that the Visual Workbench runs WINTEER each time
           a build starts. This option can slow execution.
