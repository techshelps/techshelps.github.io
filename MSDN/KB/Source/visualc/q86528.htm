The following are the Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1 API
functions that are not wrapped by the Microsoft Foundation Classes
(MFC) because they duplicate a language feature or a library routine.

SetWindowWord                       Member data in derived class


</PRE>(1) The property list mechanism is similar to member variables in that
data is associated with an HWnd. However, member variables must be
known at compile time, while a property list is maintained at
run-time. A user can get similar functionality by using an MFC list
object for this kind of member data.
