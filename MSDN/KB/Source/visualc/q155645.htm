<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article documents known problems that can cause an ActiveX control to
fail to work in Visual Basic for Windows while still allowing the control
to work successfully in an MFC control container.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Occasionally an ActiveX control works successfully in an MFC control
container but fails when used in Visual Basic. The failure in Visual Basic
is usually caused by a problem with the control. The following are known
problems that can cause this type of behavior.

<UL><LI>The control has been created with the simple frame option specified in
   ControlWizard but there is no call to the COleControl::EnableSimpleFrame
   method.
<P>
   By default, if the simple frame option is specified, ControlWizard
   adds a call to EnableSimpleFrame to the COleControl-derived class's
   constructor. ControlWizard also adds the OLEMISC_SIMPLEFRAME
   MiscStatus bit to the status bits for the control. If the call to
   EnableSimpleFrame is removed but the OLEMISC_SIMPLEFRAME MiscStatus
   bit is still specified, Visual Basic crashes with an Access Violation
   when the control is added to a form.
<P>
   If the OLEMISC_SIMPLEFRAME MiscStatus bit is turned on for a
   control, the COleControl::EnableSimpleFrame method must be called.

<LI>The control has been given a property that is declared as type BSTR in
   the control's .odl file, but which is really of some other type, such as
   long, short, or double. Typically this kind of type mismatch happens
   when the .odl file for the control has been manually edited rather than
   letting ClassWizard handle the adding and removing of properties.
<P>
   In order for the problem to occur, the property must have been
   added via ClassWizard as a non-BSTR type and have been implemented
   as a member variable, not as Get/Set methods. If the control's .odl
   file is manually edited and the type of the property is then changed to
   BSTR but the corresponding control member variable type and dispatch map
   entry are not changed to reflect the new type, Visual Basic can crash
   with an Access Violation when the control is added to a form.

<LI>A control implements a property, event, or method that has the
   same name as one of Visual Basic's extended properties, events, or
   methods.
<P>
   For example, if the control implements properties named DragIcon or
   DragMode, the problem might occur.
<P>
   To avoid the problem, rename the conflicting property, event, or
   method.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: For information on all of Visual Basic's extended properties,
methods, and events, please refer to the online topic "Object Property" in
Visual Basic 5.0.
