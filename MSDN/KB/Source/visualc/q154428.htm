<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The file Vc41b.exe contains a patch to the Visual C++ versions 4.1 or
4.1a MFC DLL and run-time library to solve a number of Win32s problems.
Below is the information from the Readme.txt which is included with the
patch. See the instructions below for more information about how to
download and apply the patch.

<P><h3>Summary</h3>
 
<P>
This patch updates MFC version 4.1 to correct several problems that occur
when running on Win32s. If you have built an MFC application with Visual
C++ 4.1 and are supporting Win32s you may have noticed one or more of the
following problems, all of which are fixed in this patch:

<OL><P><LI>Problem with caching pointers to DLL entry points after final
   FreeLibrary.

<P><LI>AfxWinInit/SetCurrentHandles benign asserts.

<P><LI>We load OLEPRO32.DLL, but store the instance handle in a global, not
   process local variable. This is what is causing a failure during
   IPersistMemory::Load after creating the control.

<P><LI>On process detach of an OCX, we are not cleaning up all the module
   process state. This causes problems if multiple instances of an OCX
   are loaded in the same or separate processes.

<P><LI>If you create a DLL that calls the AfxGetThread function and is being
   used by multiple applications you can run into problems caused by data
   being global and not process local.

<P><LI>Problems running multiple OCX containers as described in the following
   Microsoft Knowledgebase article have been fixed.  These problems were
   caused by a combination of the problems described in items 4 and 5
   above.

</PRE></OL><h3>Caveats</h3>
 
<P>
Several of the MFC files that can get patched are optionally installed.
You may get a message in the patch log stating that a particular
file was not found, and that is OK. For example, if you did not install
the Unicode MFC libraries, the Patch program will not find them.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problems and Workarounds</h3>
 

<UL><LI>During any of the steps above, the Patch program may tell you that you
   already have a copy of the newer files on disk. If it tells you this
   information, it will not patch the files in your \windows\system
   directory. To remedy this situation, make sure that you do not have
   any other copies of the files listed above in your PATH.
<P>
   If the above solution does not work, run the Patch commands above
   using the /NOP switch. For example, use "Patch /NOP mfc41b." This
   switch tells the Patch program not to search your PATH for newer
   files.
<P>
   If your files still are not being patched, copy the files listed above
   into a temporary directory and run the Patch command with the /NOP and
   /NOS command-line options. For example, use "Patch /NOS /NOP mfc41b."

<LI>You may get the error ept0038, indicating that a particular file
   could not be deleted. This error can occur because the DLL is still
   locked in memory. Be sure you have closed all applications before
   running the patch. If this solution does not work, restart Windows and
   run the patch before starting any other applications.
<P>
</UL>-  If you run this patch on Windows NT or Windows 95, an error message
<PRE>   (see below) stating that the old version of the file could not be
   found but one with the same name exists is displayed. No update will
   be done.

     wpt0036:old File not found: The C run-time DLL which is being
     patched, MSVCRT40.DLL, is a Win32s specific version.

</PRE><h3>Readme from Visual C++ 4.1a Patch</h3>
 
<P>
I. Summary
<P>
This patch updates MFC to fix a problem you may be seeing in an application
that uses the Microsoft database classes. Using certain ODBC drivers you
may get an "Out of memory" error. See below for a list of files updated and
a more complete description of the problem.
<P>
This patch also updates the debugger in the Microsoft Developer Studio to
fix a problem where you may not be stopping at breakpoints you have set in
a project that was built from a directory structure that contained long
names. This problem did not exist in Visual C++ 4.0. See below for a list
of files updated.
<P>
II. Description of MFC Bug
<P>
An error can occur when mapping a CString to a SQL_LONGVARCHAR,
SQL_VARCHAR, or other SQL data type field if a driver returns a large
precision value from SQLDescribeCol() for the column.
<P>
A bug in the MFC ODBC Database classes results in MFC trying to allocate a
large chunk of memory to store data that might have this large precision.
<P>
In some cases, such as using a memo field with the FoxPro Desktop ODBC
driver, a memory allocation of 1 gigabyte may be attempted. Or, as is the
case with the Visual FoxPro driver, the MFC Database Classes will try to
allocate a negative number of bytes because the return value of the driver
is 2 gigabytes and then MFC adds 1, which causes the signed variable to
wrap into a negative value. In this case, an assertion occurs in
GetBufferSetLength() on line 447 of Strcore.cpp:
<P>
<PRE>    ASSERT(nNewLength &gt;= 0);

</PRE>Mapping a CString to a SQL Server text field produces the same result.
<P>
The problem occurs only when mapping CString variables to
variable-length fields using the RFX_Text() function.
