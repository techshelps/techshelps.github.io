The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When installing Visual C++ 4.2, you may get several missing file/directory
messages. The first message usually is:
<P>
<PRE>   "Setup cannot access the source file X:\MSDEV\include\ALGORITHM"

</PRE>where X is the CD-ROM drive letter or a network mapped CD-ROM drive letter.
<P>
Other messages include missing files such as EXCEPTION, FUNCTIONAL,
STDEXCEPT, STREAMBUF, and STRSTREAM. All of them are in X:\MSDEV\include
directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The error messages are generated if a real-mode CD-ROM driver is used to
install Visual C++ 4.2 in Windows 95. Real-mode CD-ROM drivers cannot
access long file names. You may also see these error messages if you run
the Visual C++ setup program across the network and the network driver does
not support long file names.
<P>
The file names listed above are more than eight characters long. These
files are the header files for the Standard C++ Library. In order to make
these files available on your system, you may want to copy them manually
from CD-ROM to the \msdev\include directory on your hard drive. Note that
you are able to see only the abbreviated file names if the driver you are
using supports only 8.3 file names. You can rename the files after you copy
them to your hard drive. Below is a table that lists the abbreviated file
names and the full file names:
<P>
<PRE>   05/28/96  01:04a            47,951 ALGORI~1        algorithm
   06/04/96  07:03p             1,860 EXCEPT~1        exception
   05/28/96  01:05a             9,656 FUNCTI~1        functional
   05/28/96  01:05a             2,970 STDEXC~1        stdexcept
   05/28/96  01:05a             6,087 STREAM~1        streambuf
   05/28/96  01:05a             3,813 STRSTR~1        strstream

</PRE><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
This information is also available in the VCREAD.WRI file located in the
MSDEV directory of the Visual C++ CD, which reads as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   "If you are running Windows 95 and are using real-mode CD-ROM drivers,
   you will not be able to access long filenames from the Visual C++ CD.
   This may cause errors during Setup."
</PRE>
