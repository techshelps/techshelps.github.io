</PRE><h3>Visual Workbench Windows Not Visible Under Certain Circumstances</h3>
 
<P>
Minimized Visual Workbench windows may not be visible under certain
conditions when they are subsequently restored. This happens if you
take all three of the actions listed below:

<UL><LI>Minimize Visual Workbench child windows within the Visual Workbench
   frame.

<LI>Minimize Visual Workbench.

<LI>Exit Windows with Visual Workbench in the previously noted state.
<P>
</UL>When you restart Windows and then Visual Workbench, the minimized MDI
children are still minimized. When you restore them, however, the open
windows are off screen. You can press ALT+- (ALT + minus sign) to
display the system menu for the window even though it is not visible.
You can then close the window, and subsequently reopen it.
<P>
To avoid this condition, don't close Windows while Visual Workbench is
still running and is minimized.
<P>
<P><h3>Interrupting the Visual Workbench Debugger</h3>
 
<P>
The Visual Workbench debugger, unlike CodeView, allows you to set
breakpoints in a source file while the program being debugged is
running. This will usually interrupt your program at a defined
breakpoint. In cases where you cannot set a breakpoint to halt the
program, such as when encountering an infinite loop, you can interrupt
your program by pressing CTRL+ALT+SYSREQ. After this type of
interrupt, the Visual Workbench debugger gains control.
<P>
Note that if you interrupt your program while Windows or other system
code is executing, the results can be unpredictable.
<P>
<P><h3>Text for Some Check Boxes May Not Be Visible</h3>
 
<P>
With some Windows color schemes, the text associated with check boxes
that are disabled may not be visible. If this happens, open the Colors
dialog in the Control Panel and either change the Disabled Text color
to a color besides Light Gray, or set the Button Face to Light Gray.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Visual Workbench Debugger and CodeView for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot use the Visual Workbench Debugger and CodeView for Windows
at the same time. Starting the Visual Workbench Debugger while
CodeView for Windows is running will generate a generic error (Unknown
Error in Windows ( -22 )).
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Stop Debugging and Restart Commands</h3>
 
<P>
Only use the Stop Debugging and Restart commands on the Debug menu
when absolutely necessary. This helps to minimize problems that can be
encountered when stopping and restarting a debugging session, due to
the fact that the application being terminated does not get a chance
to free its own resources or memory, or to unload any DLLs it is
using.
<P>
<P><h3>Opening QuickWatch on a Variable</h3>
 
<P>
During a debug session, you can open the QuickWatch dialog box on any
variable by typing the variable name in the Find box on the toolbar
and pressing SHIFT+F9. The shortcut keys F1 (Help), F11 (Goto
Definition) and SHIFT+F11 (Goto Reference) also work on entries in the
Find box on the toolbar, regardless of whether a debug session is
running.
<P>
<P><h3>Debugging while running SPY.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the SPY.EXE program during a debugging session with the
Visual Workbench debugger, only give SPY commands while the program
being debugged is running. Do not use SPY to select windows to watch,
or close SPY when the program being debugged is at a breakpoint. Doing
so can cause both SPY and Visual Workbench to crash.
<P>
<P><h3>Debugging System-level Hooks</h3>
 
<P>
The Visual WorkBench debugger must set task-level hooks on the program
being debugged to prevent it being called when stopped. Thus, the
debugger can only debug a task-level hook that the program being
debugged has installed for itself.
<P>
<PRE>   Example ( debuggee code ):
   SetWindowsHookEx(hookProc, hInstance, GetCurrentTask( )) ;

</PRE><h3>Debugging MS-DOS Programs</h3>
 
<P>
To debug an MS-DOS program using the integrated debugger, first build
it as a QuickWin application and debug it using Visual Workbench. When
the program is debugged, rebuild it as an MS-DOS application.
<P>
<P><h3>Building MS-DOS Overlaid Applications</h3>
 
<P>
MS-DOS overlaid applications built within Visual Workbench require a
module-definition file (.DEF) in the project list. Unlike
Windows-based project types, you will not be warned by Visual
Workbench if your MS-DOS overlaid application does not contain the
required module-definition file.
