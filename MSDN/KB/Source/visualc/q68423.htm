<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft C/C++, the use of a CTRL+Z (hex 1A, decimal 26) is limited in
a file opened in text (translated) mode. If a file contains a CTRL+Z, there
can be only one occurrence of it and it must be the last character in the
file.
<P>
No other instance of a CTRL+Z is allowed in text mode. By using multiple
CTRL+Zs, or by having characters after the CTRL+Z, you may cause fseek(),
or run-time functions that call fseek(), to behave in an unexpected manner.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By using one of the following, these functions will perform as expected if
you have multiple CTRL+Zs in the file.

<UL><LI>Open the file in binary (untranslated) mode.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Convert your input file to meet the previously mentioned conditions
   of a text file.
<P>
</UL>When opening a file in binary mode, you must remember that the file is
untranslated. This means that on input, the carriage return-linefeed (CR-
LF) combination is not translated into a single linefeed (LF) character,
and on output, the (LF) character is not translated into a (CR-LF)
combination.
<P>
This may necessitate modifications to your I/O routines that deal with
newlines (\n) and carriage returns (\r).
<P>
<P><h3>Examples of Opening Binary Files</h3>
 
<P>
The following opens a file called FILENAME.DAT for both reading and writing
in binary mode:
<P>
<PRE>   FILE * fileptr;
   fileptr = fopen( "filename.dat", "rb+");

</PRE>The letter "b" in the access mode designates opening for binary mode.
<P>
The following opens a file called FILENAME.DAT for both reading and writing
in binary mode.
<P>
<PRE>   int filehndl;
   filehndl = open( "filename.dat", O_CREAT | O_BINARY | O_RDWR,
                                    S_IWRITE | S_IREAD);

</PRE>The O_BINARY constant designates the file to be opened in binary mode.
<P>
With both of the file-open commands, it should be noted that the text
(translated) mode is the default mode. You may link with an object module
called BINMODE.OBJ to change the default mode to binary. This file is
located in your LIB subdirectory.
<P>
This is expected behavior for the Microsoft C/C++ Compiler.
