The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.1, 4.2,
   4.2b, 5.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The CEditView and the CEdit classes wrap the Windows edit control. These
classes have limits on the amount of text that they can contain. These
limits are operating-system dependent.
<P>
Windows 95 has a 64 KB limit on edit controls that cannot be increased. To
adjust the limit within this range, use CEdit::SetLimitText(UINT nMax),
where nMax is the number of bytes in the new text limit. You can set nMax
to 65535 to obtain the maximum (which is actually 64000 bytes).
<P>
Windows NT has a practical, machine-dependent limit on edit controls. Users
will run into this machine-dependent limit before they reach operating-
system dependent limit. You can increase the limit by using
SetLimitText(UINT nMax). You can set nMax to some large number such as
4111222333 to obtain the maximum your machine will allow. The practical
limit is based on the computer's RAM. For example, it is possible to load 1
million very short lines of text (nearly 8 MB) into an edit control using a
computer with 64 MB of RAM. Unfortunately, it may use up nearly 100 percent
of the CPU power and take several minutes to load. Once it is loaded in
memory, the control works slowly.
<P>
If you need to use a control that is expected to contain near or over 64 KB
of data, use CRichEditCtrl or CRichEditView. These classes wrap the rich
edit Windows control. In both Windows 95 and Windows NT4, there is no
definite limit on the amount of text that the control can hold.
Theoretically, the rich edit control allows for a maximum of 4 GB of text.
In practice, you can run into performance problems with even less than 1 MB
of text. Files with many lines of text (not necessarily large files,
because the lines can be very short) require a lot of time and CPU power to
process the first time scrolling or resizing of the view window. Once the
CPU has processed these actions, the control behaves normally.
<P>
The maximum text that a CRichEditCtrl can hold can be changed by calling
CRichEditCtrl::LimitText(). However, this will not effect any of the
problems just mentioned. One possible option for storing huge amounts of
text into a RichEdit control would be to only stream in the amount of text
that is needed at a time. This would not be easy, because you need to
handle the scrolling logic to load in the appropriate text for the position
of the scrollbar thumb for this method to work.
<P>
Another option is to design your own Cview-based class.

<P>
Some word processing sample programs that ship with Visual C++ are:

<UL><LI>MultiPad: Provides a simple illustration of how to use CEditView.

<LI>SuperPad: Illustrates advanced uses of CEditView through class
   derivation, including toggling the word wrap state of the edit control
   and changing the screen and printer font.

<LI>WordPad: Example of a professional word processing application written
   using MFC that is included with Windows 95. It is based on the
   CRichEditView, CRichEditDoc, and CRichEditCntrItem classes.
