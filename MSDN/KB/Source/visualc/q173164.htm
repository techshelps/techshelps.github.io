The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The development environment included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Developer Studio may appear to hang for 60 seconds or more when loading a
workspace.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Please refer to the MORE INFORMATION section.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Please refer to the MORE INFORMATION section.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Following are several known causes:

<OL><P><LI>You may have many nodes expanded in InfoView.
<P>
</OL>After loading the class information for a workspace, Developer Studio
restores the state of the InfoView pane to when you last saved the
workspace. The more nodes that are expanded in InfoView, the longer it
takes to restore the state. For optimal load time, collapse all of the
nodes in InfoView, then save the workspace.

<OL><P><LI>You may have a corrupted workspace options file.
<P>
</OL>The workspace options file will have the same base name as your project
with a .OPT extension. This file does not contain the file lists or the
build options needed to successfully build your projects. You may safely
delete this file. If you find that you need to delete this file frequently,
run a disk analysis tool such as ScanDisk to test the surface of your disk
for bad sectors.

<OL><P><LI>You may have network or CD drive paths in your environment, Developer
   Studio options, or project settings.
<P>
</OL><h3>Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
To edit paths from your environment in Windows NT, click the Start menu and
select Settings, Control Panel, and click the System icon. Select the
Environment tab. Note that there are two list boxes for environment
variables: System Variables and User Variables. Check both of these for any
network or CD drive paths.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
To edit paths from your environment in Windows 95, use a text editor and
open the C:\autoexec.bat file.
<P>
The environment variables you are most interested in are PATH, INCLUDE, and
LIB. These contain the executable, include file, and library search paths
respectively.
<P>
Remove all paths that point to locations on your network or your CD-ROM
drive.
<P>
<P><h3>Developer Studio Options</h3>
 
<P>
To edit paths in your Developer Studio options, from the Tools menu, select
Options. Select the Directories tab. In the "Show directories for" list,
cycle through each of the four sets of paths--executable, include, library,
and source--and remove all paths that point to locations on your network or
your CD-ROM drive.
<P>
<P><h3>Project Settings</h3>
 
<P>
To edit the paths in your project settings, from the Project menu, choose
Settings. Select the C++ tab. Select "Preprocessor" from the Category drop-
down list. Under "Additional include directories," remove all paths that
point to locations on your network or your CD-ROM drive. Select the Link
tab. Select "Input" from the Category drop-down list. Under "Additional
include directories," remove all paths that point to locations on your
network or your CD-ROM drive.
<P>
Save your projects and try again. If the problem persists, it may be that
you created a new configuration based on a configuration that did have an
include or library search path in the project settings that pointed to a
location on your network or your CD-ROM drive. In this case, Developer
Studio saves the options that the configuration was created with so that if
you choose to click the Reset button on the Project Settings dialog box,
the project settings will be reset to the options with which the
configuration was created. There are two ways to modify this:
<P>
- Delete all such configurations and recreate them
<P>
- Use a text editor to modify the project file (.DSP) directly. This option
<PRE>  is dangerous and may render the project file unusable in certain
  circumstances.

</PRE><P><LI>The size of the .NCB is dependent on the number and size of your
   classes. It is regenerated when you open your workspace. You may delete
   this file and see if there is any improvement in load time.
