The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Component Gallery included with:
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When launching an MFC MDI application through a document from Explorer, an
assertion is hit in the Afxwin2.inl file. This assertion only occurs if the
application contains the Tip of the Day and Splash Screen components from
the Component Gallery.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When an application is launched by opening its document, MFC delays showing
the main frame window. This delay is enough to cause the Tip of the Day
modal dialog box to be parented off the modeless Splash Screen dialog box
instead of the main frame. When the timer expires for the Splash Screen, it
destroys itself and its children including the Tip of the Day dialog box.
MFC still tries to process messages for that dialog box, thereby causing
the assertion.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Delay showing the Tip of the Day dialog until after the Splash Screen
destroys itself.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When an MFC application is normally launched (from the .exe file), the
default behavior is to create the MDI Main frame window and to show it at
the end of InitInstance(). When a splash screen is inserted from the
component gallery, the Splash Screen modeless dialog box is displayed
during CMDIFrameWnd::LoadFrame() which is called before the main window is
shown. When the Tip of the Day component is inserted, its modal dialog box
is shown after the main window is shown. A modal dialog box by default uses
the last activated popup window as returned from ::GetLastActivePopup() as
its parent. The code in CWnd::GetSafeOwner() which is called by
CDialog::PreModal() uses the main window as the parameter to
GetLastActivePopup() thereby returning the main window because it was the
most recently active. As a result, the Tip of the Day dialog box is
parented off the main window. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   BOOL CTipApp::InitInstance()
   {
      ...
      if (!pMainFrame-&gt;LoadFrame(IDR_MAINFRAME)) // Display splash screen.
         return FALSE;
      m_pMainWnd = pMainFrame;
      ...
      if (!ProcessShellCommand(cmdInfo))  // Handle FileDDE or FileOpen
         return FALSE;
      ...
      pMainFrame-&gt;ShowWindow(m_nCmdShow);
      ...
      ShowTipAtStartup();  // Display Tip of the Day dialog box.
      ...
   }

</PRE>When an MFC application is launched from opening a document from the
Explorer, the shell sends a DDE message to the MFC application and the
shell command line information contains a DDE flag. This flag sets
m_nCmdShow to FALSE so that the window can be shown later when the DDE
message is processed by CDocManager::OnDDECommand(). This allows the Splash
Screen to be the last activated window, so the Tip of the Day dialog box is
parented off of it.
<P>
Because the Splash Screen kills itself by using a timer, it takes the tip
of the day dialog box with it. This causes an assertion in line 35 (or line
39 in Visual C version 5.0) in the CWnd::SendMessage() inline function in
the Afxwin2.inl file. This is because MFC is still running its
RunModalLoop() and is trying to send a message to an invalid hWnd.
<P>
One workaround is to remove the call to ShowTipAtStartup() from
InitInstance() and to simply display the Tip of the Day dialog box after
the Splash Screen is destroyed. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   void CSplashWnd::HideSplashScreen()
   {
      // Destroy the window, and update the mainframe.
      DestroyWindow();
      AfxGetMainWnd()-&gt;UpdateWindow();
      AfxGetMainWnd()-&gt;PostMessage(WM_COMMAND, CG_IDS_TIPOFTHEDAY);
   }
