The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 7.x, 8.x, and 9.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If the attribute for the AUTOEXEC.BAT file is read-only, Microsoft Mouse
Setup copies all the appropriate files to the hard disk, but Setup then
displays a message similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   The Microsoft Mouse software was successfully copied onto
   your disk. However, SETUP can not complete the installation
   process because

      C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT

   is a Read-Only file and cannot be modified by SETUP.

   To allow SETUP to complete the installation, you must change
   this file to have read and write permission, then run SETUP
   again.

   For more information on Read-Only files, please refer to the
   "ATTRIB" in your DOS manual.

   When ready, press Q to Quit.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If the attribute for the AUTOEXEC.BAT file is set to read-only, the
Microsoft Mouse Setup program does not edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. This
prevents the Microsoft Mouse software from loading automatically.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Remove the read-only attribute, then run Setup again.
<P>
NOTE: If you are running the Stacker program, see the section titled
"Stacker," later in this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Changing File Attributes in MS-DOS</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the root directory (for example, C:\), type the following at the
   MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      attrib autoexec.bat
</PRE><P>
   If the file is read-only, the following is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>      R   C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT

   NOTE: The "R" in the above message indicates the file is read-only.
   If an R is not displayed, the problem with Setup not editing the
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file is occurring for some other reason.

</PRE><P><LI>To remove the read-only attribute from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, type the
   following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      attrib -r autoexec.bat
</PRE>
<P><LI>To verify that the file now has the read/write attribute, type the
   following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      attrib autoexec.bat
</PRE><P>
   If the file is changed correctly, the R indicating the file is read-only
   should not be displayed.
<P>
</OL><h3>Changing File Attributes in Windows</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Windows, select the File Manager icon.

<P><LI>Select the root directory (for example, drive C), and highlight the
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Change Attributes.
<P>
   If this file is a read-only file, the read-only option box is selected.
<P>
   NOTE: If the read-only option is not selected, the problem with Setup
   not editing the AUTOEXEC.BAT file is occurring for some other reason.

<P><LI>To change the file attributes, deselect the Read-Only option box if it
   is enabled. This allows you to edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
</OL>Once the AUTOEXEC.BAT file has the read/write attribute, run the Microsoft
Mouse Setup disk again, and choose to load the Microsoft Mouse driver
software automatically.
<P>

files. If you are running this program, contact Stac Electronics to
