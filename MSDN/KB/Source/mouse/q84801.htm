The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 8.1 and 8.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The cursor grow feature included with Microsoft Mouse driver versions
8.1 and 8.2 does not affect the cursor within the body of a Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet. There is no known workaround.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Beginning with Microsoft Mouse driver version 8.1, a grow feature was
added to the Microsoft Mouse driver to enlarge the cursor size during
movement of the Microsoft Mouse. This feature is to make the pointer
more visible on laptop machines. When the mouse pointer is no longer
moving, the pointer reverts to its previous size after a specified
time. To enable this feature, use the Mouse Control Panel supplied with
the driver and set the pointer to either medium or large.
<P>
However, when using Microsoft Excel version 3.0 or 4.0, the cursor
within the body of a spreadsheet is a large plus sign (+). This cursor
is not affected by the grow feature (that is, it remains a constant
size). When the Microsoft Mouse is moved outside of the spreadsheet
body, the grow feature works as it should when active.
<P>
