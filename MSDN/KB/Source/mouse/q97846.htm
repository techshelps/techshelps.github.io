The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for Windows, version 9.0
<LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 8.2 and 9.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Mouse Manager, MOUSEMGR.EXE, is a program that works with
the MS-DOS-based and Windows-based versions of the Microsoft Mouse
driver. The program allows you to easily change values in your
MOUSE.INI file without actually editing the file yourself. It also
allows you to dynamically change the state of the driver or dynamic-
link libraries (DLLs). For example, if you change sensitivity, Mouse
Manager changes the sensitivity of the active software AND writes the
new value in your MOUSE.INI file so that the new value is used the
next time the mouse is loaded.
<P>
Note: Mouse Manager works only if an appropriate mouse driver is
running (Mouse Driver for MS-DOS version 8.2 or later or Windows Mouse
Driver for Windows version 9.0).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following files are included with Microsoft Mouse Manager for
version 9.0:
<P>
<PRE>   MOUSEMGR.EXE
   MOUSEMGR.DLL
   MOUSEMGR.HLP
   ERGODEMO.DLL
   CTL3D.DLL

</PRE>Mouse Manager interacts with the following programs and files:
<P>
<PRE>   MOUSE.EXE
   MOUSE.DRV
   MOUSE.INI
   POINTER.EXE
   POINTER.DLL
   Windows Video Driver

</PRE><h3>Mouse Manager Run in MS-DOS</h3>
 
<P>
In MS-DOS, Mouse Manager receives mouse-specific information from the
MS-DOS-based mouse driver and allows you to dynamically change the
state of the driver or DLLs. If you change a value for a variable (for
example, sensitivity) and then choose the OK button, Mouse Manager
changes the sensitivity of the active software and writes the new
value to the MOUSE.INI file. (Mouse Manager creates a MOUSE.INI file,
if necessary.)
<P>
<P><h3>Mouse Manager Run in Windows</h3>
 
<P>
To function correctly in Windows, Mouse Manager requires the
MOUSEMGR.DLL and CTL3D.DLL files.
<P>
The following are optional files:

<UL><LI>MOUSEMGR.EXE
<P>
   This file is used only if you launch the program from your Windows
   desktop or from an MS-DOS command prompt. (Windows Control Panel uses
   MOUSEMGR.DLL, not MOUSEMGR.EXE.)

<LI>ERGODEMO.DLL
<P>
   If this file is present, it is loaded and the Custom button is
   displayed in the lower-right corner of the Main panel; otherwise,
   no button is shown.

<LI>POINTER.DLL
<P>
   If POINTER.DLL is not already in memory, Mouse Manager tries to
   load it. If POINTER.DLL isn't available, the cursor options and
   Extra Points features are disabled.

<LI>MOUSEMGR.HLP
<P>
   This file provides Mouse Manager Help.

<LI>MOUSE.INI
<P>
   This file is written to only if something is changed. Mouse Manager
   doesn't read MOUSE.INI.
