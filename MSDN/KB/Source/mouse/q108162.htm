<UL><LI>Microsoft BallPoint Mouse with QuickPort connection
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft BallPoint Mouse with QuickPort connection is not a Microsoft
retail product. It is sold and supported by original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs). Contact your computer manufacturer's technical
support group for assistance with problems or questions regarding the
Microsoft BallPoint Mouse with QuickPort connection.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Hardware</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft BallPoint Mouse with QuickPort connection is sold to OEMs in
two parts: 1) the BallPoint Mouse itself and 2) the quick connector, which
must be built into the notebook computer at the time of assembly. It is not
possible to retrofit a notebook computer with a quick connector.
<P>
<P><h3>Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
Toshiba ships version 8.21 of the Microsoft Mouse driver with its QuickPort-
enabled notebooks. Texas Instruments ships version 8.22 of the Microsoft
Mouse driver with their QuickPort-enabled notebooks. Versions 8.21 and 8.22
differ from retail versions of the Microsoft Mouse driver since they must
support a QuickPort device on a notebook.
<P>
Microsoft does not provide technical support for the QuickPort BallPoint
Mouse or the 8.21 and 8.22 mouse drivers. If you are experiencing a driver-
related problem, contact the manufacturer of your notebook computer.
