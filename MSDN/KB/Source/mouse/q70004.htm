The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x,
   and 9.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The mouse pointer is frozen or moves slowly in IBM DOSSHELL or in
applications launched from DOSSHELL. These symptoms are known to occur in
PC Tools, version 6.0, and Norton Utilities, version 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Mouse may not work in IBM DOSSHELL and in applications
launched from DOSSHELL if both the IBM mouse driver and the Microsoft Mouse
driver are loaded.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the Microsoft Mouse driver and remove the
IBM mouse driver from the DOSSHELL.BAT file as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Locate the DOSSHELL.BAT file and make a backup copy of it. The file
   is usually located in the C:\DOS directory.

<P><LI>Load DOSSHELL.BAT into a text editor.

<P><LI>Find the line in the file that begins with "@SHELLC" followed by
   several command-line parameters.

<P><LI>Delete the mouse driver command-line switch /MOS:PC???DRV.MOS, where
   ??? = IBM, MS, or MSD.

<P><LI>Save the edited DOSSHELL.BAT file and reboot the machine.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Mouse works in the IBM DOSSHELL even when no Microsoft Mouse
driver is loaded. This is because the DOSSHELL has a built-in mouse driver
that is activated with a command line switch in the DOSSHELL.BAT file (that
is, /MOS:PC???DRV.MOS).
