The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft IntelliPoint Software version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft IntelliPoint Software version 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft IntelliPoint software can work with pointing devices that
are 100 percent Microsoft compatible (such as those that are built into
many laptop computers). This feature was added to allow the use of an
external Microsoft mouse or the built-in internal pointing device depend-
ing on whether or not the external mouse is connected to the computer.
This article describes how to configure the IntelliPoint software for use
with an embedded (built-in) pointing device.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To set up the IntelliPoint software to work with an embedded pointing
device, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the MSINPUT.INI file.

<P><LI>Add the following line to the file
<P>
<P><PRE>      EMBEDDEDTYPE=&lt;location&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;location&gt; is PS2, serial1, or serial2, depending on the
   location of the embedded device.

<P><LI>Save and then close the MSINPUT.INI file.
<P>
</OL>The "EMBEDDEDTYPE=" line causes the mouse driver to search all other ports
before the port listed on the "EMBEDDEDTYPE=" line.
<P>
After you install the IntelliPoint software, the port on which the embedded
device is installed can be determined by starting the computer without the
external mouse attached and then editing the MSINPUT.INI file. The value in
the "MOUSETYPE=" line in the [mouse] section is the value you should use
for the "EMBEDDEDTYPE=" line. For example, if the embedded device is
functioning properly and the "MOUSETYPE=" line is
<P>
<PRE>   MOUSETYPE=serial2

</PRE></OL>you should set the "EMBEDDEDTYPE=" line to:
<P>
<PRE>   EMBEDDEDTYPE=serial2

</PRE>If the embedded device is on the same port as the external mouse, the
computer, not the IntelliPoint software, must be able to determine whether
or not the external mouse is connected. In this situation, the IntelliPoint
software cannot distinguish between the internal and external mouse, and
may not see the external mouse. If this occurs, you must reconfigure the
embedded pointing device to use a port that is not used by the external
mouse or disabled.
<P>
For information about configuring or disabling the embedded pointing
device, please refer to your computer documentation or manufacturer.
