The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x,
   and 9.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If the mouse driver is installed, but the mouse does not work, the
problem may be due to one of the following:

<UL><LI>A software conflict
<LI>A hardware conflict
<LI>A faulty mouse
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Troubleshoot mouse problems as follows:

<OL><P><LI>To rule out a software conflict, boot from a "vanilla" MS-DOS (that
   is, no AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS files) and manually install the
   mouse driver from the Mouse Setup disk by typing "MOUSE" (without the
   quotation marks).

<P><LI>If you have a serial mouse, make sure that your serial ports are
   correctly configured.

<P><LI>Verify that the mouse driver is installed on the correct device.
   Problems can occur if the mouse driver is installed on a device
   other than the mouse port; for example, a noisy bus can cause the
   driver to install for a bus mouse or a device such as a modem can
   cause the driver to think a serial mouse is being used.
<P>
   If you suspect the driver is not installing on the correct port,
   use the mouse switches to direct the driver to the specific port.
<P>
   For example, if your mouse is on COM2, load the mouse driver with
   the following command:
<P>
<PRE>      MOUSE /C2              &lt;- install driver on COM2

</PRE><P><LI>If you have a bus mouse, check the jumper settings for a possible
   interrupt conflict, an I/O address conflict, or expansion slot
   problems.

<P><LI>If the problems continue, test the mouse on another machine to
   determine if you have a faulty mouse.
<P></OL>
