</PRE> 
<P><h2>Part 1: GENERAL NOTES</h2>
 
<P>
1.1  Using IntelliMouse with a Switch Box
<P>
<PRE>     If you use a switch box to connect your IntelliMouse pointing device
     to two or more computers, be sure to install IntelliPoint 2.0 on both
     machines.  Otherwise, your IntelliMouse pointing device may work
     erratically, or the wheel and wheel button may stop functioning.

     In addition, do not move your mouse while switching between computers,
     or you may lose the wheel and wheel button functions. Restart your
     computer if the wheel and wheel button stop working.

     If you experience other problems with the switch box, it may be due to
     the way the switch box passes through the mouse data. Contact your
     switch box supplier for support.


</PRE>1.2  Using an External Mouse with a Laptop Computer
<P>
<PRE>     Some laptop computers enable you to use both an internal and external
     pointing device at the same time.  If you find that the external mouse
     works erratically, or you lose the wheel and wheel button
     functionality (if it is an IntelliMouse pointing device), change the
     system settings on the laptop to have the system automatically detect
     the external pointing device before the internal pointing device.  If
     your laptop computer does not support automatic detection, you can
     also try attaching your mouse to the serial port.  See your laptop
     documentation for information about changing system settings.


</PRE>1.3  Mouse is not working or not working properly
<P>
<PRE>     If your mouse is not working, or is not working properly, there may be
     another device (such as a modem or internal pointing device) using
     either the same port or interrupt used by the mouse.  Turn off your
     computer and try connecting the mouse to a different serial or PS/2
     port.


</PRE>1.4  Mouse Icon Disappears from Taskbar
<P>
<PRE>     When you install IntelliPoint 2.0, a Microsoft Mouse icon appears on
     the taskbar (in the lower right corner).  You can click this icon to
     open IntelliPoint.  However, if you turn off all the features on the
     Visibility and StepSavers tabs and the Odometer feature on the
     Productivity tab, the Mouse icon disappears from the taskbar.


</PRE>1.5  Using IntelliPoint with EasyBall
<P>
<PRE>     If you attach both a Microsoft mouse and an EasyBall mouse to your
     computer, you can select a different set of pointers for each mouse.
     (You select the Easyball pointers in PointerLand and the Microsoft
     Mouse pointers in IntelliPoint.)  However, if any pointers are
     animated, both pointing devices will use the same animated pointer.
     For example, if the "Busy" pointer is animated for the Microsoft
     mouse, you will get the same "Busy" pointer when you are using the
     EasyBall mouse.


</PRE>1.6  If SnapTo Doesn't Work the Way You Expect
<P>
<PRE>     If you enable the SnapTo feature on the IntelliPoint StepSavers tab,
     the pointer automatically moves to the default button when you open a
     dialog box.  However, if there is no default button, or if the buttons
     in the dialog box are not standard Windows buttons (many normal-
     looking buttons are actually custom buttons that SnapTo can't find),
     then the pointer snaps to the center of the dialog box.  If you prefer
     that the pointer not move automatically to the center of the dialog
     when there is no default button, but remain where it is, you can
     disable the feature in those cases.

     &gt;&gt;&gt;To prevent the pointer from snapping to the center of a dialog box:

     1  Click the Start button, then click Run.
     2  Type REGEDIT and then press ENTER.  (In Windows NT 3.5x, type
        REGEDT32.EXE and then press ENTER.)
     3  In the Registry Editor, open HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Control Panel/
        Microsoft Input Devices/Mouse.
     4  In the right window, change the setting for SnapToCenterOfWindow
        from "ON" to "OFF".
     5  Restart your computer.

     WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious
     problems that may require you to reinstall Windows.  Microsoft cannot
     guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of the
     Registry Editor can be solved.  Use the Registry Editor at your own
     risk.

     For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing
     Keys And Values" online Help topic in the Registry Editor
     (Regedit.exe).  Note that you should make a backup copy of the
     registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the registry.
     These files are located in the Windows folder.


</PRE>1.7  SmartSpeed Description is Incorrect
<P>
<PRE>     In the IntelliPoint Online User's Guide and the Getting Started
     manual, the description of the SmartSpeed feature is slightly in
     error.  Turning on SmartSpeed slows the pointer over some controls,
     such as icons and dialog box buttons, but not all of the controls
     listed.


</PRE>1.8  Disabling Point32.exe If You Use CorelDRAW
<P>
<PRE>     If you use IntelliPoint with CorelDRAW version 6.00.112, you will get
     a general protection fault when you open CorelDRAW.  Until you receive
     your upgrade to CorelDRAW version 6.00.167, you can temporarily fix
     this error by disabling Point32.exe while using CorelDRAW.

     &gt;&gt;&gt;To disable Point32.exe:

     * From Windows 95, press CTRL+ALT+DEL to display the Close Program
       dialog.  Select Point32, and then click End Task.

     * From Windows NT 4.0, press CTRL+ALT+DEL, then click the Task Manager
       button.  In the Task Manager, select Point32 and then click End
       Task.

     * From Windows NT version 3.51, use File Manager to rename the file
       Point32.exe to another name, then restart your computer.  Click OK
       when Windows informs you that a program listed on the run line is
       not available.  Remember to restore the original name once you
       upgrade CorelDRAW.


</PRE>1.9  Disabling SnapTo If You Use CorelDRAW
<P>
<PRE>     If you use the Zoom In feature in CorelDRAW, be sure to disable the
     SnapTo feature on the IntelliPoint StepSavers tab.  Zoom In does not
     work if SnapTo is enabled.


</PRE> 
<P><h2>Part 2: NOTES FOR WINDOWS NT USERS</h2>
 
<P>
2.1  Installing Windows NT 4.0 over IntelliPoint 2.0
<P>
<PRE>     If you install Windows NT 4.0 over Windows NT 3.5x and IntelliPoint
     2.0, the Windows NT 4.0 default Mouse Properties software replaces the
     IntelliPoint software.  Although Windows NT 4.0 provides support for
     the IntelliMouse pointing device, not all of the IntelliPoint features
     are available on the Windows NT 4.0 Mouse Properties software.  To
     have access to all of the IntelliPoint features, reinstall
     IntelliPoint 2.0.


</PRE>2.2  Installing IntelliType over IntelliPoint 2.0
<P>
<PRE>     In Windows NT 3.51 only, if you lose the IntelliMouse wheel and wheel
     button functionality after installing the IntelliType version 1.1
     software (available with the Microsoft Natural Keyboard), run Setup to
     reinstall IntelliPoint 2.0.


</PRE>2.3  Attaching Multiple Pointing Devices in Windows NT
<P>
<PRE>     If you attach both an IntelliMouse pointing device and a second mouse
     of a different type (such as a Microsoft Mouse without a wheel), you
     may encounter the following problems:

     *  If you reset the right button to be the primary button using the
        Button Selection feature on the Basics tab in IntelliPoint, the
        second mouse does not recognize the change.

     *  You cannot use the second mouse to set Orientation on the
        Productivity tab in IntelliPoint, and the second mouse does not
        recogonize any changes you make using the Orientation feature.

     *  In Windows NT 3.51 only, the wheel and wheel button on the
        IntelliMouse pointing device do not function.

     NOTE:  This does not apply to an external mouse attached to a laptop
     with an internal pointing device.


</PRE>2.4  Changing the Mouse Driver in Windows NT
<P>
<PRE>     If you are running Windows NT, it is recommended that you do NOT
     change the mouse driver.  (For Windows NT 4.0, the mouse driver is set
     on the General tab in IntelliPoint; in Windows NT 3.5x, the device
     driver is set in the Windows NT Setup program in the Main program
     group.)  If you change the device driver, your computer may stop
     responding when you restart it.

     &gt;&gt;&gt;To recover if your computer stops responding:
     1  Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to restart your computer.
     2  Press the Spacebar when prompted to display the Hardware
        Profile/Last Known Good menu.  (In Windows NT 3.5x, press the
        Spacebar to invoke the Last Known Good State.)
     3  Press "L" to choose "Last Known Good configuration."  (In Windows
        NT 3.5x, use the down arrow instead.)
