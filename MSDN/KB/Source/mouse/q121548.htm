The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft IntelliPoint Software Home Edition version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft IntelliPoint software version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Erratic behavior occurs in Windows or Windows for Workgroups when you
enable both the Snap-to option (with Return To Previous Position selected)
and the Focus option in Microsoft IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To eliminate these problems, disable one of these options, or deselect the
Return To Previous Position option.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Examples of erratic behavior include the following:

<UL><LI>If a window with a default button and any other window are open
   simultaneously, problems may occur when you try to switch between the
   two by moving the mouse pointer over the title bars. Specifically, after
   moving the pointer to the title bar of the second window and then to the
   title bar of the window with the default button, any subsequent attempts
   to return to the title bar of the second window result in the mouse
   pointer snapping to the default button on the first window.

<LI>In the previous scenario, if the second window (the window without the
   default button) is minimized, slightly different behavior results. After
   moving the pointer to the minimized window, any attempts to go to the
   title bar of the window with the default button result in the mouse
   pointer snapping to the minimized second window.

<LI>If two windows with default buttons are open simultaneously, similar
   problems may arise when attempting to switch between the two by moving
   the mouse pointer over the title bars. In this case, after moving
   between the title bars of the two windows once, any subsequent attempts
   to do so result in the mouse pointer continuously switching between the
   two windows.
