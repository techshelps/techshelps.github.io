I. IMPORTANT ERGONOMIC SAFETY INFORMATION
<P>
<PRE>  *******************************************************************
  * Some studies suggest that long periods of repetitive motion,    *
  * coupled with an improper work environment and incorrect work    *
  * habits, may be linked to certain types of physical discomfort   *
  * or injury. These include carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS),          *
  * tendinitis, and tenosynovitis. It is important to follow all    *
  * instructions carefully. Failure to do so may result in CTS,     *
  * tendinitis, or tenosynovitis. These instructions may not only   *
  * help minimize your chances of experiencing one of these         *
  * conditions, but will also help you to work more comfortably     *
  * and effectively. Ensuring that your chair, work surface, and    *
  * the placement of the mouse are in the correct positions is      *
  * important. In addition, you should take frequent breaks to      *
  * avoid sitting in the same position for extended periods of      *
  * time. See the end of this README for more important ergonomic   *
  * information.                                                    *

II. THE MOUSE SETUP PROGRAM

<OL><P><LI>Modifications to Your System
<P>
   The following changes are made to your system if you set up the
   software using all the default conditions during the mouse Setup
   program (default directory is c:\mouse).
<P>
   For the mouse driver in MS-DOS, Setup makes the following changes:
<P>
   a. Installs or modifies lines similar to the following in
<P><PRE>      AUTOEXEC.BAT:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      set mouse=c:\mouse
      c:\mouse\mouse.exe
</PRE><P>
   b. Adds mouse to the PATH statement.
<P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: Setup adds mouse to the beginning of your PATH statement.
      However, the end of your PATH statement may be truncated if it
      contains too many elements.
</PRE><P>
   c. Deletes the following line (if it exists) from CONFIG.SYS:
<P>
<P><PRE>      device=c:\mouse.sys
</PRE><P>
   For the mouse driver in Windows, Setup makes the following changes:
<P>
   a. Adds the following line to the load line in WIN.INI:
<P>
<PRE>      [windows] section            c:\mouse\pointer.exe

   b. Modifies the following lines in SYSTEM.INI:

      [boot] section               mouse.drv=c:\mouse\mouse.drv
      [boot.description] section   mouse.drv=Microsoft Mouse version
                                   9.00
      [386enh] section             keyboard=mousevkd.386

   c. Adds a group to PROGMAN.INI:

      groupn=c:\mouse\mouse.grp
      (where n = group number and \mouse=mouse directory)

   d. Setup updates to the latest CTL3D.DLL file to the Windows System
      directory (if it's not already there).

   e. If you have Microsoft Windows version 3.0, Setup installs
      WINHELP.EXE.

</PRE><P><LI>Returning Your System to Pre-Setup Condition
<P>
   To return your system to its previous condition before you
   ran the mouse Setup program, make the following modifications:
<P>
   a. Remove the following line from WIN.INI:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\mouse\pointer.exe
</PRE><P>
   b. Change the following lines in SYSTEM.INI to read:
<P>
<PRE>      [boot] section               mouse.drv=mouse.drv
      [boot.description] section   mouse.drv=Microsoft, or IBM PS/2
      [386enh] section             keyboard=*vkd

</PRE><P><LI>Setting up with a Floppy Disk System
<P>
   Setup supports only hard disk systems and floppy disk systems
   with two drives. If you are installing files onto a floppy disk
   system that has only one drive, you must decompress and copy the
   files manually. EXPAND.EXE, a file-decompression program, is
   provided on the Setup disk for this purpose.
<P>
   To install using a single-drive floppy disk system:
<P>
   a. Insert the Setup disk into drive A and type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      expand mouse.ex$ b:mouse.exe
</PRE><P>
   b. When prompted by MS-DOS, remove the Setup disk and insert
<P><PRE>      your destination disk.
</PRE><P>
   c. Reinsert the Setup disk in the drive and type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      expand mousemgr.ex$ b:mousemgr.exe
</PRE><P>
   d. When prompted by MS-DOS, remove the Setup disk and
<P><PRE>      insert your destination disk.
</PRE><P>
   To load your mouse driver, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      mouse
</PRE><P>
   Run Mouse Manager to set pointer options, if desired.
   To run Mouse Manager, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      mousemgr
</PRE><P>
   If you install the software using a dual floppy disk system,
   set up the mouse software from drive b to drive a.

<P><LI>Loading MOUSE.EXE into Upper Memory
<P>
   The MS-DOS mouse driver automatically loads itself into
   upper memory, if available. Using the MS-DOS loadhigh command
   may cause your mouse software to load into low memory.
<P>
</OL> 
<P>
III. THE MOUSEPWR FEATURE
<P>
Some laptop computers have the capability to go into a sleep mode
to conserve power when not being used.  Load the MOUSEPWR feature if
your mouse becomes erratic after you resume from sleep mode. MOUSEPWR
restores pre-sleep mode settings of the mouse when you resume work on
the laptop.
<P>
It's not necessary to use MOUSEPWR if your system has Advanced Power
Management (APM). However, this feature requires very little memory
(928 bytes) and won't conflict with APM if both are loaded on your
system.
<P>
The MOUSEPWR feature is not automatically copied during the mouse
Setup program. Use the MS-DOS copy command to load MOUSEPWR.COM to
your system. The MOUSEPWR feature must be loaded at the MS-DOS prompt
only (not in Windows). If you need to load MOUSEPWR to your system,
add it to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that it loads each time you turn
your system on. For example, if MOUSEPWR is in the root directory,
add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
<PRE>   c:\mousepwr.com

</PRE></OL>Otherwise, you'll need to load MOUSEPWR manually each time you want to
use it. Type the following line at the MS-DOS prompt to load the
MOUSEPWR feature manually:
<P>
<PRE>   \mouse\mousepwr.com

</PRE>where 'mouse' is the directory containing the MOUSEPWR.COM file.
<P>
 
<P>
IV. MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT SUPPORT FOR YOUR MOUSE
<P>
Microsoft Windows NT will have Microsoft mouse drivers included. For
additional mouse support for Microsoft Windows NT, contact Microsoft
Customer Service upon release of Microsoft Windows NT. Inside the
U.S.A., call 1-800-426-9400. Outside the U.S.A., please contact your
subsidiary.
<P>
 
<P>
V. MEET THE MOUSE
<P>
Meet the Mouse is a short, animated demonstration that is available
for viewing when you run the mouse Setup program. You can also watch
Meet the Mouse from Mouse Manager. Meet the Mouse takes approximately
two minutes to run if you have the minimum required configuration set
up for Microsoft Windows. Meet the Mouse may run slower if you have
less than the required configuration, or if you have a 24-bit graphics
card.
<P>
To save disk space, you can remove this demonstration by deleting the
ERGODEMO.DLL file from the directory that contains your mouse
software.
<P>
 
<P>
VI. NOTES ON MOUSE MANAGER FEATURES

<OL><P><LI>MS-DOS and Windows Features
<P>
   When you choose Set Buttons, Overall Pointer Speed, Acceleration,
   and Orientation from Mouse Manager in Windows, the changes do not
   affect the MS-DOS driver until you reboot your computer. However,
   if you set these features from the Mouse Manager in MS-DOS, the
   changes affect both MS-DOS and Windows.

<P><LI>Magnify
<P>
   Once you activate Magnify with the keyboard key and mouse, release
   the key and mouse button. Click any mouse button to return your
   pointer to normal.
<P>
   If you move the magnified pointer quickly in highly graphical
   applications, it may take a few seconds for the screen to fully
   redraw.
<P>
   You cannot use the Magnify feature on pull-down menus because the
   activating keystroke causes the pull-down menu to close. This also
   applies to other items that are deactivated by a single keystroke.

<P><LI>Screen Wrap
<P>
   Screen Wrap cannot move off the edge of the screen while Microsoft
   Windows is busy (for example, while the pointer is an hour glass).

<P><LI>Snap-to
<P>
   If Snap-to does not work in some dialog boxes, it is because the
   default buttons in these dialog boxes do not adhere to the standard
   Microsoft Windows user interface specifications.

<P><LI>Mouse Trails
<P>
   You can not adjust the length of Mouse Trails for Paletized video
   drivers through Mouse Manager.
<P>
</OL> 
<P>
VIII. OTHER ISSUES

<OL><P><LI>MS-DOS Support for the IBM XGA Video Card
<P>
   A file called XGA.VDM is on your Mouse Setup disk, but is not
   automatically copied during Setup. You need to copy this file to your
   mouse directory only if you have an IBM XGA card in your system. This
   file will give you MS-DOS support for your XGA card.

<P><LI>Hot Keys on LCD Screens
<P>
   On some LCD screens some of the hot keys do not show up or are not
   highlighted.

<P><LI>Large and Medium Pointers
<P>
   When using a large or medium sized pointer, some MS-DOS applications
   may not redraw the pointer correctly, resulting in "mouse droppings."
<P>
   When using a large or medium sized pointer, some applications for
   Windows may not enlarge the pointer correctly.

<P><LI>Windows 3.0 Support
<P>
   Setup does not update Mouse Manager in the Windows Control Panel,
   version 3.0. But Setup still creates a mouse program group which
   contains Mouse Manager.
<P>
   There is no support for the mouse driver in an MS-DOS windowed
   application within Windows 3.0. To get mouse support, run your MS-DOS
   application full screen within Windows (ALT + ENTER switches between a
   window and full screen).
<P>
</OL> 
<P>
VIII. MORE ERGONOMIC INFORMATION
<P>
Personalizing your environment so that it is comfortable for your work
situation promotes a healthy physical and mental lifestyle. Studies
show that a carefully planned work environment can actually increase
productivity. Of course, only you can judge what s best for you, so
we encourage you to adapt these tips to your own needs.
<P>
Exercises
<P>
Exercise and frequent breaks play an important part in staying alert
and comfortable on the job. Take periodic breaks to rest your eyes,
move your body, and get your circulation flowing. Try some of the
following exercises several times during the day.
<P>
Gently press your hands against a table, stretch, and hold for five
seconds. Stretch and massage your fingers, hands, wrists, and forearms
throughout the day. Gently shake your hands and fingers to relieve
tension and help blood flow. Rotate your shoulders in a full forward
circle four times. Then roll them backward four times. Then rotate
each shoulder separately four times. Do this at least twice daily.
Organize your work so that you alternate using your computer with
other activities. Try to use different muscle groups throughout the
day. Get up and walk around several times a day.
<P>
Note: If you experience pain while using your computer, consult a
qualified health professional.
<P>
Chair and Desk
<P>
A chair that is adjustable in height is a good place to start. It
should be comfortable and provide firm support to the lower back
(lumbar region). Adjust the chair so that your forearms form
approximate right angles with your upper arms and so that your
feet rest flat on the floor. If your feet don t rest flat on the
floor, use a footrest that is high enough so that your thighs are
about parallel to the floor while you re seated.
<P>
If at all possible, place your system on a desk designed for a
computer. Traditional writing desks are sometimes too high for
computer use. A proper height between your chair and your desk is
essential. And don t forget good posture -- slouching puts unnecessary
strain on your back and weakens muscles.
<P>
Display and Lighting
<P>
Place the display screen directly in front of you at a comfortable
viewing distance. Sit in your chair and make sure that the top of the
display is no higher than eye level. Make sure you can t see glare and
bright reflections on the screen (anti-glare filters help) or on your
mouse, and keep your screen clean and dust free.
<P>
It s important to look away from your display frequently. Several
times every hour, focus on an object about 20 feet away and slowly
inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth.
<P>
Keyboard and Mouse
<P>
Position the keyboard directly in front of you on the desk. While
you re typing and using the mouse, keep your shoulders relaxed and
let your upper arms hang freely at your sides. Let your elbows hang
loosely near your body and allow enough room on your desk for
unhindered movement of the mouse. Your forearms should be nearly
parallel and at approximate right angles to the floor as you type
and use the mouse.
<P>
Position the mouse at the same height as your keyboard. If you can,
try to avoid light sources that can reflect on the surfaces of your
mouse and keyboard. Use your entire arm to move the mouse around
on your desktop whenever possible. The Microsoft Mouse is designed
so that you can rest your hand on it whenever possible, and so that
you don t have to grip it unusually hard when using it. Avoid
excessive tension in your hand by relaxing -- don t pinch the
mouse too hard.
<P>
The high-performance level of the Microsoft Mouse makes it
unnecessary to use a mouse pad. However, if you do use a mouse
pad, make sure it is not so thick that it raises your arm and
the mouse. Your arm should maintain an approximate right angle
to the horizontal table top. The mouse pad should provide smooth
friction for ease of use -- it should not be too slippery. It
should also be lint free so the mouse ball doesn t get dirty.
<P>
he design of the Microsoft Mouse accommodates a wide variety
of grips and lets you use the mouse in either hand. The mouse
allows for several possible work positions, which can help you
avoid unnecessary strain on your arms and hands. By periodically
varying the way you hold the mouse, you don t repeat the same
motion over a long period of time. The software that comes with
the Microsoft Mouse (Mouse Manager) supports the mouse design
by letting you customize the software for variable work positions.
It s a good idea to periodically readjust your software as you get
better acquainted with your mouse.
