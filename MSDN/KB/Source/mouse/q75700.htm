<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to install a Microsoft Mouse in OS/2 versions
1.2x after OS/2 is already fully installed on the machine. If OS/2
1.2x is not yet on the machine, then query on the following words:
<P>
<PRE>   mouse and OS/2 and 1.2x and choices and install

</PRE>This information applies to all versions of the Microsoft Mouse and
the Microsoft BallPoint Mouse.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note: If you are going to run Microsoft Paintbrush version 4.0 in the
OS/2 DOS compatibility box, or the Microsoft Mouse will be attached to
a PS/2-style mouse port of an AT-style machine, then proceed to the
section titled "Installing the Microsoft OS/2 Mouse Driver" further
below. In all other cases, proceed with the following directions.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the OS/2-Supplied Mouse Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
The mouse device drivers that accompany OS/2 1.2x are divided into two
categories: device dependent (DD) and device independent (DI). To
install a Microsoft Mouse using the OS/2-supplied drivers, you must
determine what the appropriate device-dependent driver is for this
configuration. To do this, you must determine the exact type of
machine, the exact type of Microsoft Mouse, and how the mouse will be
attached. For more information on determining the exact type of
Microsoft Mouse, query on these words:
<P>
<PRE>   mouse and FCC and ID

</PRE>Choose the appropriate device-dependent mouse driver from the
following table according to the type of machine being used and the
type of mouse:
<P>
<PRE>   IBM PS/2 Machines           AT-Style Machines
   -----------------           -----------------

   IBM PS/2 Model 30/286:

   On PS/2 port   = MSPS201    On serial port = MSSER01
   On serial port = MSSER01    Bus card       = MSBUS01
   Bus card       = MSBUS01    InPort card    = MSINP01
   InPort card    = MSINP01    On PS/2 port   = (See "Installing the
                                                Microsoft OS/2 Mouse
                                                Driver" section below)
   IBM PS/2 Model 50 or above:

   On PS/2 port   = MSPS202
   On serial port = MSSER02
   Bus/InPort cards are not
   compatible with these
   machines.

</PRE><h3>Setting Up the CONFIG.SYS File</h3>
 
<P>
Loading a Microsoft Mouse in OS/2 1.2x requires three lines in the
CONFIG.SYS File. The first line will be the same for all Microsoft
mice and all types of machines, and it should resemble the following:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\os2\pointdd.sys

</PRE>The second line will load the device-dependent mouse driver determined
from the table above. Note: The specific serial port (COM1 or COM2),
and the specific points-per-inch (ppi) of the Microsoft Mouse are
parameters for this line and must be known. The second line should
resemble the following:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\os2\msxxxxx.sys model=yyy serial=com2

</PRE>Note: serial= Must be specified only for COM2, default is to COM1.
<PRE>      model=  Must be specified only for the BUS and SER versions.
      xxxxx = The device-dependent mouse driver from the table above.
      yyy   = 099 for a 100 ppi, 199 for a 200 ppi, X99 for a
              400 ppi.

</PRE>The third line is also based on the device-dependent mouse driver
determined in the table above, and should resemble the following:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\os2\mouse.sys type=msxxx$

</PRE>Note: xxx  = The middle letters in the device-dependent mouse
<PRE>             driver (BUS, SER, INP, or PS2).

</PRE>If a choice of any Microsoft Mouse was made during the installation of
OS/2 1.2x, then all the OS/2-supplied mouse device drivers were
unpacked into the directory C:\OS2, and three lines were added to the
CONFIG.SYS file. If during OS/2 1.2x installation "None of the above"
was chosen for the type of Mouse, then no mouse device drivers were
unpacked, and no lines were added to the CONFIG.SYS file for the
mouse.
<P>
Verify that these drivers are all in the C:\OS2 directory. If they are
not, they must be unpacked into this directory from disk 2 of the OS/2
disk set. For more information on unpacking files, query on the
following words:
<P>
<PRE>   mouse and OS/2 and unpack

</PRE>Note: The MOUSE.SYS driver here is a mouse device-independent driver
from the OS/2 disks, not the MOUSE.SYS file supplied with the
Microsoft Mouse, which is a DOS mouse device driver.
<P>
Shutdown OS/2, and reboot the machine.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the Microsoft OS/2 Mouse Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Unlike the OS/2-supplied mouse drivers, the Microsoft OS/2 Mouse
driver is device independent. As long as you have a Microsoft Mouse
attached to either a Microsoft bus card, InPort card, or a Microsoft
serial Mouse attached to either COM1, COM2, or a PS/2 port, you will
load the same mouse driver in the same way.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Up the CONFIG.SYS File</h3>
 
<P>
There should be only two lines in the CONFIG.SYS file referencing the
mouse when using the Microsoft-supplied mouse driver:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\os2\pointdd.sys
   device=c:\os2\os2mouse.v12

</PRE>Verify that both these files are in the C:\OS2 directory. If the
POINTDD.SYS driver is not, it must be unpacked from disk 2 of the OS/2
disk set. For more information on unpacking drivers, query on the
words:
<P>
<PRE>   mouse and OS/2 and unpack

</PRE>If the OS2MOUSE.V12 driver is not in the C:\OS2 directory, it must be
copied from the Microsoft Mouse disk. To obtain the Microsoft OS/2
Mouse driver, OS2MOUSE.V12, call Microsoft Product Support Services at
(425) 637-7096.
<P>
Shutdown OS/2 and reboot the machine.
