<UL><LI>Microsoft OS/2 Mouse driver versions 1.1x, 1.2x, 1.3x
</UL> 
<P>
There are different Microsoft Mouse drivers for different versions of OS/2.
An Application Note is available with the most current versions of
Microsoft OS/2 Mouse drivers. This information applies to all versions of
the Microsoft Mouse. The Application Note containing the latest Microsoft
OS/2 Mouse drivers is titled "Microsoft Mouse OS/2 Update" (HD0416).
<P>
You can obtain this Application Note from Microsoft Product Support
Services. For complete information, see the "To Obtain This Application
Note" section at the end of this article.

   | NOTE: The files included on the enclosed Microsoft Mouse OS/2 |
   | Update disk are intended for use with the Microsoft Mouse or  |
   | Microsoft BallPoint Mouse ONLY.                               |
    ---------------------------------------------------------------

</PRE>The enclosed Microsoft Mouse OS/2 Update disk contains the following
files:
<P>
<PRE>   OS2MOUSE.V11  OS2MOUSE.V13
   OS2MOUSE.V12  README.DOC

</PRE>You must install the OS/2 mouse driver manually; that is, you must
copy the appropriate driver to your OS/2 directory, then modify your
CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
<PRE>    --------------------------------------------------------------
   | NOTE: Make these changes ONLY if you plan to run Microsoft   |
   | Paintbrush version 4.0 in the OS/2 DOS box, OR if you are    |
   | running OS/2 1.2x with your MS Mouse connected to a PS/2-    |
   | style port on a machine other than an IBM PS/2.              |
    --------------------------------------------------------------

</PRE><h2>SAMPLE OS/2 INSTALLATION</h2>
 
<P>
Assume that your device drivers are in the directory C:\OS2. To
install your update, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the appropriate OS2MOUSE.Vxx driver to your C:\OS2 directory.

<P><LI>Look in your CONFIG.SYS file for this line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      device=c:\os2\pointdd.sys
</PRE><P>
   (Do not delete this line.)

<P><LI>Following the line listed in step 2 should be a line that
   references your current mouse driver. Edit your CONFIG.SYS file to
   remove this line. The contents of the line will vary according to
   the type of mouse you have. The following is an example of the
   line to be removed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      device=c:\os2\ibmmou01.sys
</PRE><P>
   (Remove the line similar to this example from the CONFIG.SYS file.)

<P><LI>If you are using OS/2 version 1.2 or later, you must also remove
   the next line, which references MOUSE.SYS, from your CONFIG.SYS
   file. The following is an example of the line to be removed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      device=c:\os2\mouse.sys type=msser$
</PRE><P>
   (Remove the line similar to this example from the CONFIG.SYS
   file.)

<P><LI>Insert one of the following lines in your CONFIG.SYS file, just
   after the line loading POINTDD.SYS, for the version of OS/2 that
   you have (1.1x, 1.2x, or 1.3x):
<P>
<P><PRE>      device=c:\os2\os2mouse.v11
      device=c:\os2\os2mouse.v12
      device=c:\os2\os2mouse.v13
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
<P>
</OL>MICROSOFT BALLPOINT MOUSE:
<P><h2>SETTING ORIENTATION AND BUTTONS FOR OS/2</h2>
 
<P>
Because there is no mouse Control Panel supplied for OS/2, you must
set the BallPoint Mouse orientation and make button assignments at
startup through settings on the DEVICE= line in your CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting BallPoint Orientation</h3>
 
<P>
To set the orientation, use the ROTATE= option to specify the number
of degrees of rotation from the default (right-side) BallPoint
position.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting BallPoint Buttons</h3>
 
<P>
To set the buttons, use the BUTTONS= option. The BUTTONS= option
specifies button assignments for all four of the BallPoint Mouse
buttons. The letter P designates the primary button, S designates the
secondary button, and zero (0) designates an unassigned button (there
are two buttons with this designation).
<P>
When you use the BUTTONS= option, a value must be given for each of
the four BallPoint Mouse buttons, and only one button at a time can be
either primary or secondary. The two unassigned buttons become the
clicklock pair if the clicklock feature is used (see the "Setting the
Clicklock Feature" section after the following examples).
<P>
For more information on rotation angles and button numbering, see
Appendix A of the "Microsoft BallPoint Mouse User's Guide."
<P>
<P><h3>Right-Side Example</h3>
 
<P>
The default (right-side) configuration for the BallPoint Mouse is
represented by the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\os2\os2mouse.v12 rotate=0 buttons=p0s0

  Note: Button numbers 1 and 3 are primary and secondary,
  respectively.

</PRE></OL><h3>Left-Side Example</h3>
 
<P>
A left-side configuration is represented by:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\os2\os2mouse.v12 rotate=180 buttons=0p0s

  Note: Button numbers 2 and 4 are primary and secondary,
  respectively.

</PRE><h3>Setting the Clicklock Feature</h3>
 
<P>
To enable the clicklock feature for OS/2, use the CLICKLOCK= option:
<P>
<PRE>   device=c:\os2\os2mouse.v12 clicklock=on

</PRE>To disable clicklock, use CLICKLOCK=OFF.
<P>
<PRE>  Note: The OS/2 options ROTATE=, BUTTONS=, and CLICKLOCK= can
  appear in any order on the DEVICE= line in your CONFIG.SYS
  file. None of these options is required.
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>TO OBTAIN THIS APPLICATION NOTE</h2>
 

<UL><LI>You can have this Application Note mailed to you by calling

<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
While the version numbers (filenames), have not changed, the Microsoft
Mouse drivers have changed. The only way to distinguish between
versions is by the file size in bytes. Below is a table of the
different versions available.
<P>
<PRE>   Mouse Driver     Size       Should It be Updated?
   -------------------------------------------------

   OS2MOUSE.SYS     13028      Yes; update to OS2MOUSE.V11
   OS2MOUSE.V11     13316      No; latest for OS/2 1.1
   OS2MOUSE.V12     14436      Yes; all OS/2 1.2 users update
   OS2MOUSE.V12     14868      Yes; if MS Mouse is on PS/2
   OS2MOUSE.V12     15636      Yes; if MS Mouse is on PS/2
   OS2MOUSE.V12     15588      No; latest for OS/2 1.2
   OS2MOUSE.V13     15588      No; latest for OS/2 1.3

</PRE>NOTE: The OS2MOUSE.V12 files sizes 14848 and 15636 should work for OS/2 1.3
if the Microsoft Mouse is not on a PS/2-style mouse port.
