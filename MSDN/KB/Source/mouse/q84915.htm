The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The ATI Wonder XL video card has a built-in inport that may conflict
with the Microsoft InPort Mouse. The inport device on the ATI card
must be disabled through software to allow the Microsoft Mouse driver
to install to the Microsoft InPort card. This is done with software
provided with the video card.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some of ATI's video cards come with built-in inports or bus ports. The
following are two known examples:
<P>
<PRE>   ATI Wonder XL   Built-in Inport
   ATI Wonder Plus Built-in Bus port

</PRE>If you have one of these cards and subsequently purchase a Microsoft
InPort Mouse, the mouse driver appears to install, but the mouse does
not work. This is because the mouse driver is trying to install
to the inport/bus port on the video card. If this is the case, then
the port on the video card must be disabled.
<P>
To disable the inport/bus port on the video card, use the software
supplied with the ATI card (VINSTALL.EXE or VSETUP.EXE). In both of
these programs, options for configuring the mouse, including
"disable," are included. Once you have disabled the video card port,
the Microsoft InPort mouse should operate correctly using the InPort
card shipped with the Microsoft Mouse.
<P>
ATI has stated that the Microsoft Inport mouse operates correctly when
connected to the inport on their video card. This may work, but
Microsoft does not guarantee or recommend this.
<P>
The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
