The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver for MS-DOS, versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x,
   and 9.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information can also be found in Appendix B of the
"Microsoft Mouse Programmer's Reference" published by Microsoft Press.
<P>
<P><h3>Invalid Parameter</h3>
 
<P>
You typed an invalid parameter in a command-line switch. Make sure
that the switch is typed correctly and that it is defined for your
version of the mouse driver.
<P>
<P><h3>Driver Not Installed -- Internal Error 1</h3>
 
<P>
Insufficient space was found to load the interrupt service routine.
Load fewer TSRs or load the mouse driver in a different order when
booting the system.
<P>
<P><h3>Driver Not Installed -- Microsoft Mouse Not Found</h3>
 
<P>
The mouse hardware was not found on the system in which the mouse
driver attempted to install itself. Check the COM port configuration,
try the /c1 and /c2 switches, check for TSRs, check for conflicts with
other devices, and make sure the mouse is attached.
<P>
<P><h3>Driver Not Installed -- Interrupt Jumper Missing</h3>
 
<P>
A jumper on the bus card of a bus or InPort mouse is missing. Verify
that the jumper has been installed. Also, select another jumper
position as this message may also indicate an interrupt conflict.
<P>
<P><h3>Driver Not Installed -- Multiple Interrupt Jumpers Found</h3>
 
<P>
The mouse driver detected multiple interrupt jumpers on an InPort
mouse. You need to verify that only one jumper block is present on the
interrupt select jumper. This message may also indicate an interrupt
conflict on the system.
<P>
<P><h3>MSX Mouse Driver Installed</h3>
 
<P>
The driver for an MSX mouse on an MSX system was installed.
<P>
<P><h3>Mouse Driver Installed</h3>
 
<P>
The installation of the mouse driver was successful. If the mouse is
not working, however, try the /y, /c1, or /c2 command-line switches.
<P>
<P><h3>Switch Values Passed to Existing Mouse Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Command-line switch values were passed to the existing driver when you
reran MOUSE.COM from the MS-DOS prompt. However, once the mouse driver
has been successfully installed you cannot use command-line switches
to change the port.
<P>
<P><h3>Existing Mouse Driver Enabled</h3>
 
<P>
The previously loaded mouse driver was enabled when you reran
MOUSE.COM from the command line while a mouse driver was present. The
version number reported at this time is the version number of the
mouse driver you are trying to install, *not* the version number of
the installed mouse driver.
<P>
<P><h3>Existing Mouse Driver Removed from Memory</h3>
 
<P>
An existing mouse driver was removed from memory.
<P>
<P><h3>Existing Mouse Driver Disabled</h3>
 
<P>
An existing mouse driver was disabled, but the mouse driver was not
removed from memory.
<P>
<P><h3>Mouse Driver Not Installed</h3>
 
<P>
You used the MOUSE OFF command line, but no mouse driver was
installed.
<P>
<P><h3>Mouse Driver Installed, Cannot Change Port (/i, /c, and /b Invalid)</h3>
 
<P>
The mouse driver was successfully installed to use either an InPort
port, a serial port, or a bus port. Once the driver has been
successfully installed, you can't use the command-line switch to
change the port.
<P>
<P><h3>Mouse Driver Already Installed</h3>
 
<P>
You are trying to install another copy of MOUSE.SYS on top of an
existing one. Check your CONFIG.SYS file and modify it to load only
one copy of the driver.
<P>
<P><h3>Unable to Disable Mouse Driver -- Control Panel Is Active</h3>
 
<P>
You can't disable the mouse driver when the control panel is active.
Disable the control panel by entering CPANEL OFF with the appropriate
pathname at the MS-DOS prompt first.
<P>
<P><h3>Unable to Disable Mouse Driver -- Mouse Menu Is Active</h3>
 
<P>
You can't unload the mouse driver while a mouse menu is active in the
system. Type MENU OFF to disable the mouse menu.
<P>
