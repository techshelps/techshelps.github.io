The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft BallPoint Mouse, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When installed into Norton Desktop for Windows, the Microsoft
BallPoint Mouse Setup program does not properly create the BallPoint
Mouse Group or Control Panel. Page 19 of the "Microsoft BallPoint
Mouse User's Guide" refers to installation into the Windows Program
Manager, where the group and mouse Control Panel can be properly
installed.
<P>
When Norton Desktop is active, the installation of the BallPoint mouse
must be completed manually.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With Norton Desktop installed, the BallPoint Setup program installs the
most current MOUSE.DRV (Windows Mouse driver) into the Windows
SYSTEM.INI file. The BallPoint Mouse Group is not created, however.
<P>
The file for the mouse Control Panel, POINT.EXE, can be found in the
BALLPT directory and may be added as a program item within Norton
Desktop for Windows. When installed in this manner, POINT.EXE will be
labeled as "Microsoft Mouse Control Panel" without the BallPoint
Orientation option.
<P>
The automatic installation of the BallPoint mouse into the Windows
Program Manager labels POINT.EXE as "BallPoint Mouse Control Panel"
and offers an option for BallPoint Orientation.
<P>
<P><h3>Solution</h3>
 
<P>
To correct the utility label and to add the orientation feature, edit
the SYSTEM.INI file as follows:
<P>
In the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, change the following
line
<P>
<PRE>   From
   ----

   mouse.drv=mouse.drv

   To
   --

   mouse.drv=c:\ballpt\mouse.drv

</PRE>where drive C is the drive and BALLPT is the directory in which the
BallPoint MOUSE.DRV file is located.
<P>
In the [386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, add the following
line:
<P>
<PRE>   keyboard=c:\ballpt\bpvkd.386

</PRE>Either the following line should be commented out (by placing a
semicolon [;] at the beginning of the line)
<P>
<PRE>   keyboard=*vkd

</PRE>or any other keyboard reference line should be used in place of the
above entry.
<P>
Once these two lines are changed, restart Windows. The next time the
POINT.EXE program is run, it will appear as the "BallPoint Mouse
Control Panel."
<P>
