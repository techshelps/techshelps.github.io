</PRE>_________________________________________________________________
<P>
I. THE MICROSOFT INTELLIPOINT SETUP PROGRAM
<P>
<PRE>  1. Modifications to Your System

   The following changes are made to your system if you set up the
   software using all the default conditions during the IntelliPoint
   Setup program (default directory is c:\msinput). Future installations
   of Microsoft input devices will be installed to the msinput directory.

   a. For the mouse driver in MS-DOS, Setup makes the following changes:

      1. Installs or modifies lines similar to the following in
         AUTOEXEC.BAT:

         SET MSINPUT=C:\MSINPUT
         C:\MSINPUT\MOUSE\MOUSE.EXE /Q

      2. Removes the following line (if it exists) from CONFIG.SYS:

         device=c:\mouse.sys

   b. For the mouse driver in Windows, Setup makes the following changes:

      1. Adds the following line to the load line in WIN.INI:

         [windows] section             load=c:\msinput\pointer.exe

      2. Modifies the following lines in SYSTEM.INI:

         [boot] section               mouse.drv=c:\msinput\msinput.drv
         [boot.description] section   mouse.drv=Microsoft IntelliPoint
                                      version 1.0
         [386enh] section             keyboard=c:\msinput\msinput.386

      3. Adds a group to PROGMAN.INI:

         groupN=c:\windows\MicrosoX.grp
         (where N = next available group number, and where X = next
         available letter or number)

      4. Setup updates to the latest CTL3DV2.DLL file to the Windows
         System directory (if it's not already there).


</PRE><P><LI>Returning Your System to Pre-Setup Condition
<P>
   To return your system to its previous condition before you
   ran the mouse Setup program, make the following modifications:
<P>
   a. If there are no other Microsoft input devices installed,
<P><PRE>      then remove the following information from the load= line in
      the WIN.INI:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      c:\msinput\pointer.exe
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Do not remove this value or any other values for this setting if
      there are other Microsoft input devices installed (such as the
      Microsoft Natural Keyboard).
</PRE><P>
   b. Change the following lines in SYSTEM.INI to read:
<P>
<PRE>      [boot] section               mouse.drv=mouse.drv
      [boot.description] section   mouse.drv=Microsoft, or IBM PS/2

   c. If there are no other Microsoft input devices installed, edit
      the following value in the SYSTEM.INI file so it reads:

      [386enh] section   keyboard=*vkd


</PRE><P><LI>Setting up with a Floppy Disk System
<P>
   IntelliPoint windows Setup supports only hard disk systems. MS-DOS
   setup supports both hard disk systems and floppy disk systems with
   two drives. If you are installing files onto a floppy disk system that
   has only one drive, you must decompress and copy the files manually.
   EXPAND.EXE, a file-decompression program, is provided on the Setup disk
   for this purpose.
<P>
   To install using a single-drive floppy disk system:
<P>
   a. Insert the Setup disk into drive A: and type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      expand mouse.ex_ b:mouse.exe
</PRE><P>
   b. When prompted by MS-DOS, remove the Setup disk and insert
<P><PRE>      your destination disk.
</PRE><P>
   c. Reinsert the Setup disk in the drive and type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      expand mousecpl.ex_ b:mousecpl.exe
</PRE><P>
   d. When prompted by MS-DOS, remove the Setup disk and
<P><PRE>      insert your destination disk.
</PRE><P>
   To load your mouse driver, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      mouse
</PRE><P>
   Run IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls to set pointer options, if desired.
   To run IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      mousecpl
</PRE><P>
   If you install the MS-DOS software using a dual floppy disk system,
   set up from drive B: to drive A:.
<P>

<P><LI>If you boot from a Floppy Disk
<P>
   When you install IntelliPoint software, Setup modifies the AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file located on your default hard drive (normally C:). If you boot
   Microsoft Windows from a floppy disk, you will have to copy the two
   lines of information that were added to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file located
   on your boot disk manually. The two lines are:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SET MSINPUT=C:\MSINPUT
      C:\MSINPUT\MOUSE\MOUSE.EXE /Q
</PRE><P>
   (The target directory will be different if you installed IntelliPoint
   software in a different directory.)
<P>

<P><LI>Loading MOUSE.EXE into Upper Memory
<P>
   The MS-DOS mouse driver automatically loads itself into
   upper memory, if available. Using the MS-DOS loadhigh command
   may cause your mouse software to load into low memory.
<P>
<P>
</OL>_________________________________________________________________
<P>
II. THE MOUSEPWR FEATURE
<P>
Some laptop computers have the capability to go into a sleep mode to
conserve power when not being used. Choose the MOUSEPWR feature in Custom
Setup if your mouse becomes erratic after you resume from sleep mode.
MOUSEPWR restores pre-sleep mode settings of the mouse when you resume work
on the laptop.
<P>
It's not necessary to use MOUSEPWR if your system has Advanced Power
Management (APM). However, this feature requires very little memory (928
bytes) and won't conflict with APM if both are loaded on your system.
<P>
<P>
<P>
____________________________________________________________________
<P>
III. USING COMMAND-LINE SWITCHES IN MS-DOS
<P>
If you are using the MS-DOS version of the software, you can type
<P>
<PRE>   mouse.exe /?

</PRE></OL>at the prompt to see a list of available switches.
<P>
____________________________________________________________________
<P>
<P>
IV. NOTES ON INTELLIPOINT TOOLS &amp; CONTROLS FEATURES

<OL><P><LI>MS-DOS and Windows Features
<P>
   When you choose Set Buttons, Pointer Speed, Acceleration,
   and Orientation from IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls in Windows, the
   changes do not affect the MS-DOS driver until you reboot your computer.
   However, if you set these features from the IntelliPoint Tools &amp;
   Controls in MS-DOS, the changes affect both MS-DOS and Windows.
<P>

<P><LI>Trails
<P>
   You can not adjust the length of Pointer Trails for Paletized
   video drivers through IntelliPoint Tools &amp; Controls.
<P>
   If Pointer Trails is unavailable, it is because your video driver
   does not support this feature.
<P>
<P>
</OL>_____________________________________________________________________
<P>
V. OTHER ISSUES

<OL><P><LI>Hot Keys on LCD Screens
<P>
   On some LCD screens, some of the hot keys may not appear or are
   not highlighted.
<P>

<P><LI>Large and Medium Pointers
<P>
   When using a large or medium sized pointer, some MS-DOS
   applications may not redraw the pointer correctly, resulting
   in "mouse droppings."
<P>
   When using a large or medium sized pointer, pointers in some
   applications may be distorted. This is due to the method
   used to enlarge the pointer.

<P><LI>Using MS-DOS Disk Caching software during Setup
<P>
   If you use an MS-DOS disk cache software other than Microsoft
   SMARTDrive, don't choose Reboot after completing Setup. Choose Exit,
   then exit Windows and reboot your machine manually.
<P>
   Some DOS disk caching programs use a write behind caching technique.
   If the cache isn't flushed before rebooting, disk errors could occur.

<P><LI>Detecting PS/2 pointing devices
<P>
   Some hardware systems may have a hidden Extended BIOS for PS/2 devices
   (some AST machines for instance). To install the IntelliPoint drivers
   correctly on these machines, add the following line to the [Mouse]
   section of the MSINPUT.INI file.
<P>
   FailIfNoExtendedBIOS=FALSE
