<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides information about the support built into the
Microsoft Mouse for left-handed users.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft spent 2 years and 10 million dollars setting the standard for
ergonomics and comfort for desktop and portable pointing devices. We
studied over 500 people worldwide, disproportionately favoring left-handed
users (relative to the 11% of left-handed users worldwide), on how they
interact and use mice in everyday situations. To gather the data we used
many standard input methods: interviewing, questionnaires, video taping and
many specific devices, fiber optics and hand/fingertip pressure sensors. We
also worked with the top institutions in the field of ergonomics, The Joyce
Institute, Metaphase Design Group, Inc., and the University of Illinois,
Department of Kinesiology. Here are some quotes from the Metaphase Research
Summary:
<P>
"Performance data and user's assessment of mouse ergonomics confirm that
the new Microsoft Ergonomic Mouse is equally effective for both left-
and right-handed use -- 'ambidextrous.'"
<P>
"The new Carrera design offers the highest degree of anatomical
compatibility. Its topology most closely mirrors the palmar topology of the
hand at rest, in the 'neutral posture.'"
<P>
Our worldwide studies showed the new Microsoft Mouse is slightly more
comfortable for left-handed users than right-handed users. Have the
customer put the new Microsoft Mouse in their right hand as they would if
they were using it as a right-handed user and see how comfortable it is.
Then put it back in your left hand and compare. You'll probably find that
it supports our left hand a little better than the right, especially on the
palm of my hand at the base of my pinky and ring fingers, where the curve
is. Also take a look at the mouse from the back on, it is actually
symmetrical. Looking at it from the top gives the artificial impression of
a right-handed user bias.
<P>
Use the below information to as an example of how left-handed users can set
the mouse up for more comfortable use:
<P>
Hold the mouse in your preferred position, use the pointer finger to press
the left button, etc. but have the mouse pointing in a 45 degree angle, or
whatever angle is most comfortable. By 45 degree angle I mean if you were
facing north and looking down on the Mouse, the end the cord comes out of
is pointing in a northeast direction, not straight north. Then go to the
mouse manager and click the "Orientation" button, then click the "Set
Orientation" button and move the Mouse in a straight northerly direction,
in a straight line and still holding it at your most comfortable angle,
till the pointer hits the image of a compass in that window. This same
window will allow you to switch primary and secondary buttons should you
want to experiment with the other hold you describe.
<P>
The Orientation feature allows you to use the mouse with your hand at the
angle you feel is most comfortable. Orientation allows you to define what
direction is "North" no matter how you hold your mouse.
<P>
This should take care of most of the people we handle on this topic. The
icing on the cake is the 60 day comfort guarantee, no matter where
purchased we will refund the cost of the Mouse, including tax. And to date
we have not heard of anybody taking us up on this guarantee, and we have
sold over 1.5 million of these mice to date.
