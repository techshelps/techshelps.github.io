<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the built-in Delete command on the File menu in the versions
of Microsoft Excel that are listed at the beginning of this article, the
files you delete are not sent to the Recycle Bin. However, the files are
permanently deleted.  Note that Microsoft Excel confirms whether you want
to delete the files but does not give you the option to send the files to
the Recycle Bin.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>

This behavior occurs when you use the built-in Delete command on the File
menu in Microsoft Excel under Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT

   send to the Recycle Bin. On the File menu, click Delete.

   You are prompted whether to send the file to the Recycle Bin.

<P><LI>Click Yes.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Using My Computer</h3>

   click the folder that contains the files you want to delete.
