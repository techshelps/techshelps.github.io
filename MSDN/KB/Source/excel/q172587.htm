The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 5.0c

</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a workbook or worksheet in the versions of Microsoft Excel
listed at the beginning of this article, you may receive one of the
following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   The workbook you opened contains automatic links to information in
   another workbook. Do you want to update this workbook with changes made
   to the other workbook?

   -or-

   This document contains links. Re-establish links?

   -or-

   Update references to unopened documents?

</PRE>If you click Yes, linked pictures in the workbook or worksheet may not be
updated correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You create a link from one worksheet to a worksheet in another workbook
   by doing either of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      1. In the source worksheet, select the cell, range, or object to
<PRE></PRE>         which you want to link.

      2. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

      3. Click the destination worksheet to switch to it.

      4. Hold down SHIFT. On the Edit menu, click Paste Picture Link.

      -or-

      1. In the source worksheet, select the cell, range, or object to
         which you want to link.

      2. On the toolbar, click Camera.

      3. Click the destination worksheet to switch to it.

      4. Click anywhere in the worksheet to create the linked picture.

    -and-

</PRE><LI>When you open the worksheet that contains the link, the worksheet that
   contains the source data is not open.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this behavior, open the workbook that contains the source data
used by the link. After you do this, the paste picture link is
automatically updated. If you prefer, you can then close the workbook that
contains the source data. As long as no changes are made to the source
data, the linked picture contains the updated information.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the
beginning of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, the Paste Picture Link command, or Camera feature,
allows you to create a picture of a single cell, a range of cells, or an
embedded chart in a Microsoft Excel worksheet. When you make a change to
the source data or chart, the linked picture is automatically updated to
display the new information. Note that this is different from creating a
formula that links to a cell or range of cells; the picture is above the
worksheet in the drawing layer.
<P>
When you create a linked picture, Microsoft Excel cannot update the picture
if the workbook that contains the source data is not open. This behavior is
different from the behavior of links created by formulas; such links may be
updated even when the source data is not open.
