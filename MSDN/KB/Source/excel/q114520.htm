<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 5.x and 7.0, when you use the SELECT() function
in a Microsoft Excel 4.0 macro sheet to select a series on a chart, you
may receive either an error message or unexpected results when you
run the macro.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the SELECT() function to select a chart series, for
example SELECT("S1"), the series number is the order in which the
series data appears on the supporting worksheet, not necessarily the
series order that you have given the series data.
<P>
For example, if you create a chart with data series in columns A
through C on a worksheet, and you use the command SELECT("S1")
function in a macro to select the first series on the chart, the
series created from column A is selected, even if you have changed
the series order so that the series in column A is actually the third
series.
<P>
This behavior is different from earlier versions of Microsoft
Excel: in Microsoft Excel version 4.0 and earlier, when you use the
SELECT() command to select a series on a chart, the series order is
used.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you are writing a macro that you need to run in Microsoft Excel
versions 4.0, 5.0, and 7.0, and the syntax that you need to use depends on
the version in which the macro is running. You can use the GET.WORKSPACE()
function to determine the version, and then use the appropriate syntax as
in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   =IF(GET.WORKSPACE(2)&lt;5, SELECT("S1"), SELECT("S4"))

</PRE>Because the GET.WORKSPACE(2) command returns the version of Microsoft
Excel that you are running, you can use this to take the appropriate
action. In the above macro command, if the version of Microsoft Excel
is less than 5.0, the first series is selected, otherwise, the fourth
series is selected.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that if you use the SeriesCollection method with the Select
method in a Visual Basic macro, the series with the series order
number that you specify is returned. For example, the following macro
selects series one on the active chart.
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(1).Select
