The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you apply conditional formatting to a range of
cells, the conditional formatting may unexpectedly be displayed in cells in
the range that contain text.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if you apply a conditional format that uses "greater
than," "greater than or equal to," "not equal to," or "not between." For
example:
<P>
<PRE>   Cell Value Is greater than 5

   Cell Value Is greater than or equal to 5

   Cell Value Is not equal to 5

   Cell Value Is not between 5 and 12

</PRE>Specifically, the problem occurs because any text string has a value
greater than any number in Microsoft Excel. Microsoft Excel 97 does not
account for this fact when you use conditional formatting.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>If You Are Using "Greater Than" or "Greater Than or Equal To"</h3>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, use "between" instead of "greater
than" or "greater than or equal to" when you apply a conditional format to
a range of cells.
<P>
When you use "between," you must enter two values:

<UL><LI>The first value is the same value you were using previously; for
   example, 5. Note that if you were using "greater than" previously,
   you should increase the value by a very small amount to account for
   the difference in behavior between "greater than" and "between"; for
   example, 5.00000001.

<LI>The second value is a very large number; for example, 9.99E+307.
<P>
</UL>For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Original Condition   New Condition
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   Cell Value Is        Cell Value Is between 5.00000001 and 9.99E+307
   greater than 5

   Cell Value Is        Cell Value Is between 5 and 9.99E+307
   greater than or
   equal to 5

</PRE>When you do this, the conditional formatting is not displayed in cells that
contain text.
<P>
<P><h3>If You Are Using "Not Equal To" or "Not Between"</h3>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, do not apply conditional formatting
that uses either "not equal to" or "not between" to a cell that contains
text.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, you can use conditional formatting to force cells
within a range to use specific formatting if certain conditions are true.
For example, you can use conditional formatting to force all cells whose
values are greater than 100 to appear in a bold, red font. To apply
conditional formatting to a range of cells, select the range of cells, and
click Conditional Formatting on the Format menu.
