                      Questions and Answers: Printing
               --------------------------------------------

1. Q. When I choose Page Setup, certain options are grayed or
      unavailable. How can I access these features?

   A. A commonly requested feature for earlier versions of Excel was the
      ability to use the Reduce or Enlarge and Fit to Page options for a
      wider range of printers. Excel version 4.0 now supports these
      scaling features for all printer drivers. Other document setting
      options, however, may not be available.

      If certain options are unavailable, then the currently selected
      printer driver doesn't support these extended options. For example,
      dot matrix and plotter drivers do not support the orientation and
      paper size selections in the Page Setup dialog box. Other drivers
      may support only one of these features. When an option is not
      available in Page Setup, you may be able to edit the setting in the
      Printer Setup dialog box. For the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet drivers,
      all of the Page Setup options are available.

2. Q. I understand that a new feature in Excel version 4.0 is the ability
      to create multiple-line headers and footers. How can I do this?

   A. The creation and modification of headers and footers in Excel 4.0
      has been greatly simplified. You no longer have to use control codes
      for alignment or font selection, and you can insert a page number,
      date, time, or filename with a simple click of a button. In addition,
      you can create multiple-line headers and footers by typing ALT+ENTER
      at the point you want to insert a carriage return.

      To create a multi-line header or footer, follow these four steps:

      a. From the File menu, choose Page Setup.

      b. Choose the Header or Footer button.

      c. Select the Left, Center, or Right Section depending on where you
         want your text aligned on the page.

         To select the section with a mouse, click inside the appropriate
         section box. If you do not have a mouse, hold down the ALT key
         and press the underlined letter corresponding to the desired
         section.

      d. Enter some text into the box. At the point where you want to
         insert a carriage return, hold down the ALT key and press ENTER.

3. Q. I'd like to start my page numbering with a number greater than one.
      How can I do this?

   A. To begin page numbering with a number greater than one, you must
      modify the header or footer section in Page Setup. To do so, follow
      these five steps:

      a. From the File menu, choose Page Setup.

      b. Choose the Header or Footer button.

      c. The default footer will have Page &amp;P in the Center Section. If
         you prefer to have your page number aligned to the left or the
         right, select the appropriate section. To select it with a mouse,
         click inside the appropriate section box. If you do not have a
         mouse, hold down the ALT key and press the underlined letter
         corresponding to the desired section.

      d. If you have selected an alternate section and have a mouse,
         click the button with the pound symbol. This will place an &amp;P in
         the box. If you do not have a mouse, manually type &amp;P.

      e. To begin page numbering at a number greater than one, insert a
         plus sign after the &amp;P, and the number you'd like the numbering to
         start with, less one. For example, if you want the page numbering
         to begin with 3, insert a plus sign and the number 2 after the &amp;P.
