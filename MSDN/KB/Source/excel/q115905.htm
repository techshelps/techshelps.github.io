The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a Visual Basic macro in Microsoft Excel, if you activate a sheet
in another workbook, and you use the Run method to run a macro in the
activated workbook, such as SHEET1!Auto_Activate, you receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':

   Cannot find macro 'SHEET1!Auto_Activate'.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs if you use the Run method to run a macro contained
in another workbook, and you do not include the workbook name with
the name of the macro you want to run. The error occurs because, by
default, the Run method tries to find the macro name you specify
within the workbook that contains the code that is running, not the
active workbook.
<P>
For example, if you run a macro in BOOK1.XLS, that activates a sheet
in BOOK2.XLS, and uses the Run method to run a macro contained in
BOOK2.XLS, you must include the book name BOOK2.XLS with the macro
name in the Run method command to run the macro.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving this error message when you use the Run method to
run a macro in a workbook other than the workbook that contains the
current code, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Include the name of the book that contains the macro that you want to
   run, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Run "BOOK2.XLS!Macro_Name"
</PRE><P>
   If you are running an auto macro contained on Sheet1, you can call the
   macro from another workbook with the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Run "[BOOK2.XLS]Sheet1!Auto_Activate"
</PRE><P>
   Note that an Auto_Activate auto macro defined on a worksheet does not
   run when the sheet is activated by a Visual Basic procedure.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the ActiveWorkbook property to run the macro in the active workbook.
   This causes the Run method to search for the macro in the active
   workbook rather than the workbook that contains the code that is
   currently running. The following is an example of using this method:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Run "'" &amp; ActiveWorkbook.Name &amp; "'!Macro_Name"
</PRE><P>
