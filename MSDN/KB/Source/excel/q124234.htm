The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Open EIS Pak for Windows, version 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Open EIS Pak Setup program, you receive
the following error message if you have performed a workstation
installation of Microsoft Excel:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup could not find Microsoft 5.0 installed on your system. Please
   install Microsoft Excel 5.0 before installing this application.

</PRE>Additionally, you are not prompted for the location of Microsoft
Excel, and the Microsoft Open EIS Pak is not installed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you have performed a workstation installation of Microsoft
Excel, rather than installing the application to your hard drive, the
Microsoft Open EIS Pak Setup program cannot locate the Microsoft
Excel files, and assumes that the application is not installed.
<P>
Because it does not prompt you to locate the Microsoft Excel files,
as version 1.0 did, you cannot install the Microsoft Open EIS Pak if
you are running a workstation installation of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To install the Microsoft Open EIS Pak AND run Microsoft Excel from
the network, do either of the following:
<P>
<P><h3>One Workstation</h3>
 
<P>
To install the Open EIS Pak on a single workstation, do the following:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Perform a local (Custom/Complete, or Minimum) installation of
      Microsoft Excel to install the application to your local hard drive.

   2. Run the Microsoft Open EIS Pak Setup.

   3. Run the Microsoft Excel Setup program in maintenance mode, and choose
      the Remove All button to remove the local installation of Microsoft
      Excel.

   4. Run the Microsoft Excel Setup program again, and choose the
      Workstation installation option.

</PRE>Note that the EIS.XLA file must be located in the LIBRARY subdirectory of
your Microsoft Excel directory. This file can be stored on the network
server if necessary.
<P>
<P><h3>Multiple Workstations</h3>
 
<P>
To install the Microsoft Open EIS Pak on multiple computers that are
running workstation installations of Microsoft Excel, you can install
the Open EIS Pak on one computer using the above steps, and then copy
the Microsoft Open EIS Pak directories to other machines on the
network.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes</h3>
 
<P>
These steps assume that you have a license for every computer that is
running the full EIS Builder tools. Computers that you use to run
applications created using the EIS Builder do not need to be
individually licensed.
<P>
Note that the Microsoft Open EIS Pak Setup program does not modify
any .INI files, does not install system .DLL files, and is not
serialized.
<P>
In this example, the computer that already has the Microsoft Open EIS
Pak installed is the source computer, and the computer that needs a
copy of the Microsoft Open EIS Pak installed, is the target computer.

<OL><P><LI>On the target computer, use the network to connect to the Open EIS Pak
   directory on the source computer. By default, this is c:\eispak11,
   however, this directory could be different if it was changed during the
   Setup program.

<P><LI>Copy the EXCEL\LIBRARY\EIS.XLA file from the source computer to the
   network location of the EXCEL\LIBRARY directory that the target
   computer is using.

<P><LI>Copy the Microsoft Open EIS Pak directory, including all files and
   subdirectories, from the source computer to the target computer.

<P><LI>To run the Microsoft Open EIS Builder on the target computer, open the
   AUTHOR.XLA file, located in the Open EIS Pak directory on the computer's
   local hard drive.
<P>
</OL>If you receive an error message when you run the Microsoft Open EIS
Pak, indicating that the run-time file (EIS.XLA) can't be found, make
sure that the EIS.XLA file is located in the EXCEL\LIBRARY directory
on the network. If it is, and you still receive this error message,
copy the EIS.XLA file to the directory that contains the AUTHOR.XLA
file on the target computer.
<P>
These steps can be repeated for each target computer that you want to
install the Open EIS Pak to.
