</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you modify any entry on the Series panel of the Source Data dialog,
then go back to the Data Range panel, the range reference in the Data
range box that was previously there disappears and the following message
appears within the dialog:
<P>
<PRE>   The Chart Data Range is too complex to be displayed. If a new
   Data Range is selected, it will replace all of the series on
   the Series Panel.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are building a chart using the Chart Wizard and have made
   modifications on the Series panel of Chart Wizard - Step 2 of 4.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>You choose Chart, Source Data, to bring up the Source Data property
   sheet for a chart that already exists, and make modifications on the
   Series panel.
<P>
</UL>This behavior occurs because of the overlapping nature of the Data Range
and Series panels in the Source Data property sheet. The Data Range
field on the Data Range panel is simply a concise range value that can
include series names, series values, and category (x) axis labels. Each
of these series attributes can be individually modified on the Series
panel, despite what range is initially selected when building the chart.
Since the Data Range and Series panels are merely different
representations of the same plot data, and since the Series panel allows
for more detailed modification of the series represented in the chart,
changes to either panel can override values on the other panel.
<P>
As a result, any modifications made on the Series panel do not
automatically roll up to the Data Range panel, but instead cause the
Data Range field to appear empty, even though it really isn't.
<P>
NOTE: Even if you add a name to a series on the Series panel, then return
to the Data Range panel, the Data Range value still appears empty, even
though the modification you made might not have affected the values that
make up the Data Range.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can ignore the fact that the Data Range field appears empty on the
Data Range panel, since it does not affect the outcome of the chart. All
values that are present on the Series panel effectively determine the
Data Range value, in any case.
<P>
NOTE: If a Data Range value is reentered after changes are made to any
field on the Series panel, it will replace all of the series defined on
the Series Panel, and allow you to reestablish whether your series are in
rows or columns.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design in Microsoft Excel 97.
