Frequently Asked Questions for Macintosh

<PRE>1. Q. I heard there is a problem with Microsoft Excel changing the values
      of some specific numbers, what's the situation?

</PRE></OL>A. In Microsoft Excel there is an error that will cause three specific
<PRE>   sequences of fifteen digits to change their value either when entered as
   an individual entry or when derived from specific functions.

2. Q. Can you tell me what that means in more common terminology?

</PRE>A. What this means is that if you have entered one of three specific
<PRE>   fifteen digit numbers or come to this number as the result of a formula,
   Microsoft Excel might have changed the value of the number.

3. Q. What are the chances that I have been affected?

</PRE>A. Although it is hard to have an exact number, we believe this will only
<PRE>   affect a very small number of customers. In fact, based on our internal
   analysis the likelihood of any one of these sequence of digits appearing
   in a customer's spreadsheet is approximately 1 in 5 billion. Remember,
   the only way that this will affect you is if you have these three
   specific combinations of fifteen digits.

4. Q. If there is such a small likelihood of this occurring, why worry
      about fixing it?

</PRE>A. Our customers depend on Microsoft Excel to compute their numbers
<PRE>   accurately and we want them to feel confident when using the product.
   Even though the probability of  one of our customers having a problem
   with this is low, we can't judge the probability for each and every
   customer. So, we are trying to get all of the facts regarding this out
   so that you can determine for yourself if you need the fix. The solution
   will be available to all customers that own Microsoft Excel or Microsoft
   Office. This fix is available at no charge.

5. Q. What are you doing to fix this?

</PRE>A. We have created a solution that will correct this error. The fix is
<PRE>   currently available free of charge.

6. Q. So, what are the numbers that cause this error?

</PRE>A. The specific sequences of digits are: 140737488355328, 281474976710656
<PRE>   and 562949953421312. The decimal point may be in different places. In
   addition if you are dealing with calculations, the result has to be one
   of these three sequences of digits, plus or minus a number less than
   approximately one-half of the next decimal, times a power of 10. And
   this is only a problem when you refer to the result in certain
   functions, namely: int(), ceil(), floor(), roundup(), and if().

7. Q. Why these specific numbers?

</PRE>A. The common bond between these numbers is that they happen to be 2 to the
<PRE>   47th, 48th, and 49th power, respectively.

8. Q. Does this mean I have to check to make sure any 15 digit numbers in
      my files have not been changed by Microsoft Excel?

</PRE>A. No. Unless you entered in one of the three specific sequence of digits
<PRE>   mentioned above or have utilized one of the specific formulas mentioned
   above with very long numbers you should be fine. To double check;
   however, all you have to do once you have installed the patch is to open
   a file and press Command+Shift+F9, by doing this the patch will correct
   any numbers that were derived from functions incorrectly.

9. Q. What versions of Microsoft Excel for Macintosh does this affect?

</PRE>A. We have found this in versions of the product dating back to Microsoft
<PRE>   Excel 3.0 for Macintosh. Other Macintosh versions of the product
   affected include Microsoft Excel 4.0 for Macintosh and Microsoft Excel
   5.0 for Macintosh. We will make the fix available for no charge for any
   of our customers using any of these versions of Microsoft Excel.

10. Q. How do I get the fix?

</PRE>A. To receive the fix for Microsoft Excel for Macintosh, call Microsoft at
<PRE>  (425) 635-7080. The fix was made available in April and is provided at no
   charge.

11. Q. As a network administrator, how do I install the fix?

</PRE>A. Decompress the fixed Microsoft Excel application file and place it on
<PRE>   the network. Users can then copy the application to their local
   machines, replacing their previous version of the Excel application.

12. Q. How did you find out about this?

</PRE>A. One of our customers actually found it when working with a formula that
<PRE>   derived the number 1.40737488355328. This customer's work required that
   he create a formula in Microsoft Excel which explicitly calculated 2 to
   the 47th and take the integer portion of it. We were not previously
   aware of this error and are grateful that it was brought to our
   attention.
