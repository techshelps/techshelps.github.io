The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, the following methods may fail if the
active sheet is an embedded chart that is currently being edited and
if an object is not specified for the method:
<P>
- Charts Method (Syntax 2)
- DialogSheets Method (Syntax 2)
- Modules Method (Syntax 2)
- Sheets Method (Syntax 2)
- Worksheets Method (Syntax 2)
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each of the above methods is used to return a collection of a particular
type of sheet. For example, the Sheets method (Syntax 2) returns a
collection that consists of all of the sheets in a workbook.
<P>
If you do not include an object for each of the above methods, the
object "ActiveWorkbook" is assumed for the method. For example, these
two commands are equivalent:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveWorkbook.Sheets.Count

   Sheets.Count

</PRE>Because the ActiveWorkbook object is assumed for the second command,
both commands return the number of sheets in the active workbook.
<P>
However, if an embedded chart is currently being edited (that is, it
is surrounded by a hatched diagonal border, or it is in its own
window), the above methods may fail if an object is not explicitly
included. For example, if an embedded chart is currently being edited
and you use the command
<P>
<PRE>   Sheets.Count

</PRE>you will receive the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':
   Sheets method of Application class failed

</PRE>However, "ActiveWorkbook.Sheets.Count" will work properly even if an
embedded chart is being edited. Explicitly including an object for
each of the various methods will prevent the error from occurring.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this type of error from occurring, include a specific
object with the method. For example, instead of
<P>
<PRE>   Sheets.Count

</PRE>use:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveWorkbook.Sheets.Count

   -or-

   Workbooks("WORKBOOK.XLS").Sheets.Count

</PRE>Either of these workarounds will keep the error described above from
occurring.
