The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 3.0, 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, if a chart is copied and closed
before being pasted onto a worksheet, it is pasted in as a picture rather
than a chart. The picture is also pasted as it would appear when printed;
therefore, it appears in black and white if a black-and-white printer is
selected.
<P>
Double-clicking the chart does not bring up a chart window. With Macintosh
System 6.x, the Patterns dialog box appears when the chart is double-
clicked. With System 7.0, after some time, Microsoft Excel displays the
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to activate the source application for this embedded
   object.

</PRE>This problem occurs whether or not the chart has been saved. This problem
also occurs if the chart has been saved and reopened and is currently on
the desktop.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do not close a chart after copying it and
before pasting it to a worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When selected, an embedded chart displays "Chart" and a number in the
reference area to the left of the formula bar. In both System 6.0.x and
System 7.0, the designation "Picture" with a number appears to indicate
that it is an embedded graphic and not a chart.
<P>
With System 7.0, the EMBED function appears in the formula bar, indicating
that the picture was generated through dynamic data exchange (DDE).
However, when the picture is double-clicked, Microsoft Excel searches for
the object's creator, eventually gives up, and displays the error message.
