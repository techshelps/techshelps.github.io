The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 5.0, if you change links by clicking Links on the
Edit menu, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   External reference not valid.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive this error message if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The file you are changing the link to is open.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The file you are changing the link to does not contain a worksheet with
   the same name as the worksheet name originally used by the link.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the following appropriate method.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
If it is not possible to keep the same worksheet names in both files, close 
the file that you are changing the link to. When the file that you are 
trying to link to is closed, and it does not find the same worksheet name, 
it will prompt you for what worksheet within the workbook you want to link 
to.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
If it is possible to keep the same worksheet names, then you can change a 
link without receiving error messages. If the worksheet names are the same, 
you can change the link with the workbook open or closed. Once the link has 
been successfully changed, then you can change the name of the worksheet 
and the link will update with the new worksheet name for you.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is a known problem in the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the 
beginning of this article. The problem was corrected in Microsoft Excel for 
Windows 95, version 7.0, Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows, and Microsoft 
Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you change a link by clicking Links on the Edit menu, you can select
a workbook filename to link to. If the file that you are changing the link
to is open, Microsoft Excel assumes the workbook contains a worksheet that 
has the same worksheet name as the link(s) you are changing. If the same 
worksheet name does not exist in the other workbook, you will receive an 
error message.
