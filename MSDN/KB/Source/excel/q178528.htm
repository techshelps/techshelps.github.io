The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you double-click a cell that contains a formula that is linked to
another workbook, that workbook is not opened.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when do the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You double-click a cell that is linked to a closed workbook.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The link refers to a defined name.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following procedures.
<P>
<P><h3>Change from a Named Reference to a Cell Reference</h3>
 
<P>
For each link formula, change the link to refer to a cell reference instead
of a defined name.
<P>
If you have several formulas that refer to the same defined name, try using
the Replace command on the Edit menu to globally search for and replace a
defined name with a cell reference. For example, if you have a link formula
that refers to the defined name of Alpha and the name Alpha refers to cell
C1, then replace Alpha with $C$1.
<P>
<P><h3>Use the Open Source Command</h3>
 
<P>
Another way to open a file that the active workbook is linked to is
with the Open Source command. This command is located in the Links dialog
box. To access this command, click Links on the Edit menu. The Links dialog
shows each file the active workbook is linked to. Select the file you want
to open and  click Open Source.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
