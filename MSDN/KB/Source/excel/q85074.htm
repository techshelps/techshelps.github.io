         4.0 is fully compatible with System Software version 7.0.

       - Excel for the Macintosh version 4.0 requires 1 megabyte (MB)
         of RAM memory under System Software 6, but 2 MB is

3. Q. What features are new to Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh
      version 4.0?

   A. Microsoft Excel version 4.0 gives you unprecedented power and
      ease of use. It enables you to have instant access to powerful
      features including unmatched analytical functions, outstanding
      reporting and presentation tools, and extensive easy charting.
      Among the new features of Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh
      version 4.0 are:

       - Drag and drop, which is a fast and easy way to cut, copy, and
         paste data using the mouse. Just point to what you want to
         move and drag it to where you want it.

       - Shortcut menus, another new feature, pop up when you hold
         down COMMAND+OPTION and click the mouse. Shortcut menus give
         you instant access to common context-sensitive commands.

       - AutoFill recognizes trends and intelligently extends data and
         alphanumeric headings as far as you'd like.

       - AutoFormat applies an attractive professionally designed
         format to your worksheet with just one mouse click.

      Microsoft Excel 4.0 has the powerful analysis tools you asked
      for:

       - Scenario Manager is the best "what if" tool around. It lets
         you easily create and save multiple "what if" scenarios and
         create a summary of those scenarios.

       - The Analysis ToolPak includes the most extensive financial,
         statistical, engineering, and scientific functions of any
         spreadsheet with over 160 functions.

      Excel 4.0 has all this plus great presentation and graphics
      tools:

       - The spelling checker is a built-in feature that makes all of
         your presentations letter perfect.

       - Report Manager lets you define different areas of one or more
         worksheets and print them as one report.

       - A gallery of 90 chart types has been enhanced to include
         rotating 3-D, surface, and radar charts.

      Excel 4.0 also provides a smooth transition from Lotus 1-2-3.
      Full-file compatibility means that Microsoft Excel reads 19
      different file formats including WKS, WK1, WK3, and Impress.

4. Q. I am a Microsoft Excel developer. Does Microsoft provide any
      special programs for professional Excel developers?

   A. Microsoft will be releasing a Software Development Kit (SDK) for
      Microsoft Excel 4.0. You can obtain preliminary materials on the
      new Excel C application programming interface and the Microsoft
      Excel file formats, which will be part of this SDK, by calling
      (800) 227-4679. Choose the option for programmers who want
      information on development products and services. The Microsoft
      Sales office is open from 6:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Pacific time.
