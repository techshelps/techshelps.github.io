<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With Excel 2.x, macros often have to be manually translated for them
to run in different language versions of Excel. Starting with Excel
version 3.0, there is a new type of macro sheet format --
International Macro -- that solves this problem, making it easier for
global accounts to transfer macros between countries. Macros can be
created in the International Macro format from any language version of
Excel. They can then be run, without going through any conversion
process, in any other language version of Excel. That is, foreign
language versions of Excel have been designed to understand English
functions.
<P>
<P><h3>In the United States</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a U.S. version of Microsoft Excel, you can save a macro as an
International Macro by using the Save As command under the File menu
and selecting the Int'l Macro option. Macros created in Excel 2.x or
in Excel 3.0's or 4.0's standard macro format can be saved for
international use in this way. The International Macro will run
without modification in different language versions of Excel 3.0 and later.
<P>
NOTE: This information applies to Microsoft Excel 5.0 and later ONLY if you
are using XLM macrosheets.
<P>
It may make sense to translate quoted text strings, such as
input requests or error messages, into the local language.
<P>
<P><h3>Outside of the United States</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a non-U.S. version of Excel, you can create a NEW
International Macro by using the New command under the File menu and
selecting the Int'l Macro option. All functions and formulas need to
be in English, with U.S. country settings. This International Macro
will run without modification in different language versions of Excel.
<P>
NOTE: Again, it may make sense to translate quoted text strings.
<P>
The Int'l Macro option only appears in the New dialog box (accessed
by choosing New from the File menu) when Excel is used with a non-U.S.
country setting selected in the Windows or OS/2 Control Panel, or with
non-U.S. Macintosh system software.
<P>
Users outside of the U.S. can save an EXISTING macro created in
non-English versions of Excel (either 2.x, 3.00, or 4.00's Standard
macro format) as an International Macro using the Save As command from
the File menu. Functions and formulas will be converted to English,
with U.S. country settings. However, it will be necessary to manually
convert text arguments within certain functions for the macro to run
with other language versions of Excel.
<P>
For more information about the International Macro feature, query on
the word "intmac" (without the quotation marks).
