The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a Visual Basic module in Microsoft Excel, if you use the Run method of
the Application object to run a macro located in an add-in, you may receive
the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':

   Cannot find macro '&lt;ADDIN.XLA&gt;!&lt;Addin_Macro&gt;'

</PRE>where &lt;ADDIN.XLA&gt; is the name of the add-in that contains the macro,
and &lt;Addin_Macro&gt; is the name of the macro that you want to run.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when the add-in that contains the procedure you
used with the Run method is not currently open. Even if the add-in is
fast loaded by the following line in the EXCEL5.INI file
<P>
<PRE>   OPEN=/f C:\EXCEL\ADDIN.XLA

</PRE>where ADDIN.XLA is the add-in file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To use the Run method to run a macro that is contained in an add-in
without receiving the error message above, do any of the following:

<UL><LI>In the procedure that contains the Run method, use the Open method of
   the Workbooks object to open the add-in before the Run method as in
   the following example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Workbooks.Open "c:\EXCEL\ADDIN.XLA"
      Run("ADDIN.XLA!Macro_Name")
</PRE><P>
   -or-

<LI>Do the following to manually establish a reference to the add-in from
   the procedure that is calling the add-in macro:
<P>
   1. Activate the module that contains the procedure that is running
<P><PRE>      the add-in macro.
</PRE><P>
   2. From the Tools menu, choose References.
<P>
   3. If the add-in that contains the macro you want to run is not
<P><PRE>      listed under Available References, choose Browse.
</PRE><P>
   4. From the File Name list, select the add-in you want to reference
<P><PRE>      and choose OK. Choose OK again.
</PRE><P>

<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you fast load an add-in, for example by using the /f switch in
the EXCEL5.INI file as explained above, any menus and toolbars
contained in the add-in are available, but the add-in file itself is
not actually loaded, and any macros contained in the add-in are not
loaded. When you demand load an add-in, either by opening the add-in
file, or with the following line in the EXCEL5.INI file
<P>
<PRE>   OPEN C:\EXCEL5\ADDIN.XLA

</PRE>everything in the add-in is available, including any macros in the
add-in. Therefore, when you demand load and add-in, you do not
receive the above error message when you use the Run method to run a
macro located in the add-in.
<P>
