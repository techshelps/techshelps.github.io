<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 1.5, 2.2, 3.0, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, you can print charts to a
plotter only if you use a third-party driver.
<P>
MicroSpot and The Computer Shop are two companies that make plotter
drivers for the Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MicroSpot's MacPlot version 3.7.4 Professional supports the plotting
charts from Microsoft Excel version 3.0 or earlier. For information
about the MacPlot printer driver, call MicroSpot West at (408)
253-2000.
<P>
MacPlots II, by The Computer Shop, supports plotting to all
Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Houston Instruments plotters. However, this
driver does not support plotting directly from Microsoft Excel. To
plot Microsoft Excel charts with the MacPlots II driver, copy the
chart from Microsoft Excel and paste it into a drawing program such as
MacDraw or MacGraph. For more information on what drawing applications
are supported by the MacPlots II driver, call The Computer Shop at
(919) 299-4843.
<P>
The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
<P>
Information about the above plotter drivers has been acquired from the
producers of the respective drivers. These drivers have not been
tested by Microsoft and are not supported by Microsoft. For technical
information about the above products, please contact either MicroSpot
West or The Computer Shop.
