The Internet Assistant Wizard is not new to Microsoft Excel, but it has
changed significantly since it was released as a free add-in available on

Excel and has been enhanced to take advantage of the new Internet features
of Microsoft Office, Microsoft FrontPage and Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Excel spreadsheet data to create and distribute documents that can be
viewed online with popular browsers. By clicking a series of buttons in the
wizard, you can convert spreadsheet data to HTML format either as a
separate Web document or into an existing Web document.
