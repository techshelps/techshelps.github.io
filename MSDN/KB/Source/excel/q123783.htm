</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Excel on a computer that contains an
Intel(R) Pentium processor, you may receive unexpected results when
you perform mathematical operations that involve dividing certain
combinations of numbers. This problem is caused by an error in the
FPU, a part of the Intel Pentium chip that performs elaborate
calculations. Intel is aware of this problem.
<P>
The disk included with this Application Note contains a patch for use
with Microsoft Excel for Windows version 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 5.0a, or
5.0c. The patch allows you to do the following:

<UL><LI>Test whether the FPU in your computer is faulty.

<LI>Prevent Microsoft Excel from using the built-in FPU.
<P>
</UL>After you install the patch, Microsoft Excel will handle all math
operations as though there were no FPU in your computer. Because the
FPU is disabled in Microsoft Excel, any calculation errors that you
received as a result of the FPU will be corrected.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: This patch works with Microsoft Excel versions 4.0, 4.0a,
   5.0, 5.0a, and 5.0c (including all non-English language versions).
   The patch does not work with Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for
   Windows NT(TM).

</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the WE1136 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is your Microsoft Excel directory. For example,
   if the WE1136 disk is in drive A and your Microsoft Excel directory
   is C:\EXCEL, type the following command and press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\p5patch.com c:\excel
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>To test for a faulty FPU</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, change to the drive that contains your

   directory is on drive C, type the following command and press
   ENTER:

<P><LI>Change to your Microsoft Excel directory. For example, if your
   Microsoft Excel directory is C:\EXCEL, type the following and press
   ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd \excel
</PRE>
<P><LI>Type the following and press ENTER to determine whether your
   Pentium computer has a faulty FPU:
<P>
<P><PRE>      p5patch
</PRE><P>
   The patch will return a message stating whether your Pentium
   computer has a faulty FPU.
<P>
</OL><h3>To run the Pentium FPU patch</h3>

<P>
   Note that the following method is not recommended if you are using
   array-type formulas. Replacing the equal sign (=) in such formulas
   will require that you re-enter any array formulas as arrays.
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. Select the cell, or cells, on the worksheet that you want to
       update.
</PRE><P>
