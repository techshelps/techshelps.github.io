</PRE><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you are typing formulas in the formula bar, it is a good idea to
type all function names and column references in lowercase letters.
When you finally enter the formula, Excel will convert the functions
it recognizes to uppercase letters. You can then double-check the
syntax of names not converted to uppercase and make any changes
necessary. Excel will not convert items enclosed in quotation marks,
or names defined on the worksheet to uppercase letters, unless the
name was originally typed in uppercase letters.
<P>
&lt;graphic deleted&gt;
<P>
If you are in the process of editing a formula and need to leave the
formula bar for some reason, you can do so without losing what you've
entered. Just delete the equal sign at the beginning of the formula
and press RETURN. This method will enter the formula as text, without
checking its syntax, and allow you to do other work on the worksheet.
You can then finish editing the formula by clicking the cell and
reinserting the equal sign to the beginning of the formula.
<P>
<P><h3>Use Names for Linked References</h3>
 
<P>
When linking between different spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel version
1.0 or 2.0, use named references instead of cell references. This
method allows you to insert, delete, and move cells on the dependent
worksheet without affecting the link. In Microsoft Excel version 3.0,
the use of defined names is not necessary because linked cell
references behave in the same manner as references to cells on the
same worksheet.
<P>
<P><h3>Copying Formulas</h3>
 
<P>
It is possible to copy a formula with relative references to separate
cells in a worksheet and still have it maintain the references to the
same cells. To do this, highlight the formula in the formula bar,
choose Copy from the Edit menu, and click the "X" to the left of the
formula bar. Then, select the cell you want to paste the formula into,
click the formula bar, and choose Paste from the Edit menu. The
formula will be copied into the formula bar of the active cell exactly
as the formula appeared in the cell from which it was copied.
<P>
<P><h3>Calculate Now</h3>
 
<P>
When editing a complex formula, it is sometimes helpful to know the
value that will be returned by a portion of the formula. To do this,
select the particular references or functions in the formula bar you
want to know the value of, hold down the COMMAND key, and press the
EQUAL SIGN key (=). The selected area in the formula bar will be
replaced with its computed value as long as the formula begins with an
equal sign.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: In Microsoft Excel versions 1.0 and 2.0, there is no way to
   "undo" a formula that has been entered with the calculated values
   showing; therefore, the selected area must be re-entered. To avoid
   having to do this, after calculating the value, click the "X" to
   the left of the formula in the formula bar to return the cell to
   its previous state.

</PRE><h3>Array Formulas</h3>
 
<P>
Array formulas are useful both for entering values in a range of cells
using one formula and for creating more complex formulas.
<P>
To enter an array in a range of cells, select the cells in which you
will be entering the formula. Then, type the array formula and press
COMMAND+ENTER. This will place braces ({}) around the formula in the
formula bar and enter the corresponding array in the selected cells.
Once a range of cells has been defined as an array, any operation must
be performed on the entire array.
<P>
To edit or clear the values of the array, select the entire area and
make the necessary changes to the formula in the formula bar. In
versions of Excel earlier than 2.2, you can select the entire range by
double-clicking any cell in the array. In Excel versions 2.2 and
later, you can select the entire range by pressing COMMAND+SHIFT and
double-clicking any cell in the array. If you do not have the entire
range selected, you will get either the error message "Illegal Array
Operation" or "Can't Change Part of an Array" when you try to enter a
new formula in one of the cells of the range. If this happens, Excel
will not let you leave the formula bar until you click the "X" to the
left of the formula bar, which will restore the original array
formula. To edit these cells, select the entire array and re-enter the
necessary changes by pressing COMMAND+ENTER.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 1</h3>
 
<P>
To find the values for column C of the following table by using an
array formula, select C2 through C6 and type the formula
"=A2:A6*B2:B6" (without the quotation marks). After typing the
formula, press COMMAND+ENTER. Column C will be filled with the
appropriate values.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: This method takes up less memory than entering individual
   formulas into each cell.

          A     B     C
     -------------------
     1    X     Y    X*Y
     2    1     2     2
     3    2     4     8
     4    3     6    18
     5    4     8    32
     6    5    10    50

</PRE><h3>Example 2</h3>
 
<P>
In the following table, to have "Overdrawn" entered in column C for
all accounts with a negative balance, select C2 through C7 and type
the formula:
<P>
=IF(B2:B7&lt;0,"Overdrawn","")
<P>
Press COMMAND+ENTER to enter this as an array formula.
<P>
<PRE>           A                B      C
   --------------------------------------
   1   Account #      Balance   Status
   2     12-534     $1,200.00
   3     12-535      ($45.00)  Overdrawn
   4     12-536     $2,500.00
   5     12-537       $750.00
   6     12-538     ($350.00)  Overdrawn
   7     12-539      ($75.00)  Overdrawn

</PRE>In the table below, to enter in column D a 5-percent service charge on
the amount overdrawn, select D2 through D7 and type the formula
<P>
<PRE>   =IF(B2:B7&lt;0,-B2:B7*5%,"")

</PRE>and press COMMAND+ENTER.
<P>
To find the total owed in column E, select E2 through E7 and type the
formula
<P>
<PRE>   =IF(B2:B7&lt;0,-B2:B7+D2:D7,"")

</PRE>and press COMMAND+ENTER.
<P>
To find the number of overdrawn accounts, select B9 and type the
formula
<P>
<PRE>   =SUM(IF(C2:C7="Overdrawn",1,0))

</PRE>and press COMMAND+ENTER.
<P>
Likewise, to find the total amount overdrawn in column B, select B10
and type the formula
<P>
<PRE>   =SUM(IF(B2:B7&lt;0,-B2:B7,0))

</PRE>and press COMMAND+ENTER. The resulting table is shown below.
<P>
<PRE>       A                          B     C         D          E
