The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you use a defined name in a formula on a
worksheet, and then change the value of that name when the active
sheet is not a worksheet, the value of the defined name is not
updated on the worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To update the value of a defined name in a formula on a worksheet
when you change the value of the defined name, do either of the
following:

<UL><LI>If you change the value of a defined name in a Visual Basic procedure,
   activate a worksheet in the workbook before you change the value of the
   name, as in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Change_Name()
         ' Activate Sheet1
         Sheets("Sheet1").Select
         ' Define name with value 5
         ' or change value of existing name to 5
         ActiveWorkbook.Names.Add Name:="Test", RefersTo:="=5"
      End Sub

   -or-

</PRE><LI>To manually recalculate the sheet, activate the sheet that contains the
   formula and press F9.
<P>

<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you define a name on a workbook using the Define Name dialog box
or the Names box, the value of any new or changed name on the
workbook is updated and the new value appears in any formula in which
it is used. However, if you change the value of a defined name on the
workbook while a worksheet is not the active sheet, the workbook is
not recalculated and the value of a defined name is not updated in
any formula in which it appears.
