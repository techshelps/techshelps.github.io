The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 2.2, 3.0, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
Summary:
<P>
All Macintosh files are saved with Creator and Type attributes which
identify the source application of a file and its general kind.
Applications use Type information to restrict the file names that
appear in a File Open dialog box to those that a program recognizes
and can successfully load.
<P>
As a result, a file that does not have a type recognized by an opening
application may not appear in the list of file names within a File
Open dialog box.
<P>
In order to open documents of an unrecognized type, a different file
format must be used when saving the exported document, the file type
of the document must be edited directly, or the destination
application must have a method for 'forcing' unrecognized files to
load.
<P>
More Information:
<P>
A file's type attribute allows applications to identify files that can
be loaded successfully. In certain cases, such as when a file is
brought over from a PC environment or is generated by a recent release
of an application, an unrecognized type will be assigned to a
document. In these cases, the following strategies may provide a
workaround:
<P>
<P><h3>Save the Document to a Different File Format</h3>
 
<P>
The most straightforward workaround is to save to a file format that
is recognized by the destination application. Many spreadsheet
applications can read and write SYLK or Lotus 1-2-3 file formats (WKS,
WK1, or WK3). The DBF file formats (DBF2, DBF3, and DBF4) are a common
bridge between applications with database capabilities.
<P>
<PRE>'Force' Open the Document in the Destination Program
</PRE> 
<P>
Many programs have alternate means for opening files which can
circumvent restrictions on recognized types. These include force-open
commands from the File menu, macro or scripting languages which
include commands to open files, and the ability to specify that
certain documents load automatically on launching the program.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, a macro statement can be used to open files that
do not appear in File Open dialog box. The following macro statement:
<P>
=OPEN("Macintosh HD:Budget")
<P>
opens a document named Budget located at the root level of the hard
drive without considering file type.
<P>
An alternate method in Microsoft Excel versions 3.0 and 4.0 is to
place the files in the Excel Startup Folder (for version 4.0, this
folder is named Excel Startup Folder (4)), located in the Preferences
folder within the System Folder (under System 6.0.x, the folder is
located at the root level of the System Folder.) On launching the
application, Microsoft Excel attempts to load each document in the
Startup Folder, without considering file type.
<P>
<P><h3>Directly Edit the File Type Information</h3>
 
<P>
Older versions of applications may not recognize new file types
assigned to documents which they are capable of loading. Contact the
software manufacturer to determine if an upgrade is available that
provides this functionality. If no such upgrade exists, file type
information can be edited directly in several ways.
<P>
Various Macintosh utilities, such as ResEdit (released by Apple
Computers, Inc.), SUM Utilities (Symantec), or Disktop, allow direct
editing of file attributes, including file Type and Creator.
<P>
Apple File Exchange, an Apple utility provided with the system
software of all Macintosh computers, provides default type information
when translating files from PC to Macintosh disks. In situations where
no other solution is available, Apple File Exchange can be used to
transfer a file to a PC disk and back to the Macintosh. If only the
<PRE>'text' translator is used when bringing the file back to the
</PRE>Macintosh, the file type will be set to TEXT.
<P>
The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
<P>

file attributes, query on the following words in the Microsoft
