The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, if you click Properties on the
File menu, click the Custom tab, enter file property values, and then click
Add, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The value entered does not match with the specified type. The value
   will be stored as text.

</PRE>Also, if you click Properties on the File menu, and then click the Custom
tab, values you previously entered in the dialog box may be changed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The first problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>On the File menu, you click Properties, and then click the Custom
   tab.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You enter a name in the Name box, or click a property in the list
   below the Name box, and then click Date in the Type list.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>In the Value box, you enter a date greater than or equal to February 7,
   2040 (2/7/2040).
<P>
   -and

<LI>You then click Add.
<P>
</UL>After you receive the error message, the date appears, but it is converted
to text.
<P>
The second problem (previously entered values are changed) occurs when the
following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You open a workbook that was created in Microsoft Excel for Windows.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>On the File menu, you click Properties, and then click the Custom
   tab.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>One or more of the previously entered custom properties contain a date
   that is greater than or equal to February 7, 2040.
<P>
</UL>When this problem occurs, Microsoft Excel replaces the previously entered
dates that start at February 7, 2040 with dates that start at January 1,
1904 (1/1/1904). Note that Microsoft Excel may repeat the cycle multiple
times for exceptionally large dates.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, you cannot enter a date that is
greater than or equal to February 7, 2040 in the Custom tab of the
Properties dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem in which dates in Microsoft Excel for Windows
file are changed when you view them in the Custom tab, click Cancel in the
Properties dialog box. By clicking Cancel, you prevent Microsoft Excel from
retaining the changed dates. If you click OK, the changed date values are
retained.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you can use the Properties dialog box to set or view
properties for a workbook. The tabs in the Properties dialog box allow you
to set or view the file properties.
<P>
The design of the Macintosh computer does not allow you to set or view
dates greater than or equal to February 7, 2040 in the Custom tab of the
Properties dialog box. If you enter such a date, it is converted to text;
if you open a workbook that contains such a date, it is replaced with
another date when you view the Custom tab.
