The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Query for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Query, if you copy records in a query that contains a
field with the Image data type, and you then delete one of the
columns in the query, you receive a general protection (GP) fault.
<P>
Additionally, if you copy records in a query that contains only a
field with the Image data type, and you then delete that column, you
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Out of memory

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Normally, when you copy records in a query, and then delete a column
in the query, you receive a dialog box with the following message
<P>
<PRE>   Save large clipboard from 'QUERY.QRY'?

</PRE>where QUERY.QRY is the name of your query file.
<P>
However, when your query contains more than ten records (the actual number
of records may vary), and you copy these records and then delete one of the
columns, you receive the GP fault, and you do not receive the prompt to
save the clipboard. If your query contains only an Image field, and you
copy the records and then delete the column, you receive the "Out of
memory" error message.
<P>
This problem also occurs even if you first paste the copied query
fields to a document, such as a Microsoft Excel worksheet, and then
delete the column in the query. Note that when you paste a query that
contains an Image field to a document in another application, you
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   General ODBC Error

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving a GP fault when you copy records in a query that
contains an Image field, copy data in another query, or in another
application, before you delete a column in the query that contains an
Image field.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
in the version of Microsoft Query that ships with Microsoft Excel
version 5.0c for Windows.
