The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed above, if you enter a formula
in which the value 10 is raised to either a very large power or a very
small power, the formula may return an incorrect result:
<P>
<PRE>   10 Raised to       Expected Result   Actual Result
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   very large power   #NUM! error       0, 0.1

   very small power   0                 #DIV/0! error, 10^&lt;some value&gt;

</PRE>NOTE: These problems do not occur in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel.
Also, the problem does not occur when you raise a value other than 10 to
a very large power or a very small power; for example, =9^10000000000
correctly returns a #NUM! error.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur when you enter a formula in which the value 10 is
raised to a power in one of the following ranges:
<P>
<PRE>   - greater than or equal to 2^31 (2,147,483,648) and
     less than or equal to 10^308 (1 followed by 308 zeroes)

      -or-

   - less than or equal to -(2^31) (-2,147,483,648) and
     greater than or equal to -(10^308) (-1 followed by 308 zeroes)

</PRE>For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Formula you type          Value returned
   ----------------------------------------

   =10^2147483648            0
   =10^10000000000           0.1
   =10^(10^308)              0.1

</PRE>These formulas should all return a #NUM! error, because the largest
positive number allowed in Microsoft Excel is 9.99999999999999E+307,
which is just less than 10^308.
<P>
Or:
<P>
<PRE>   Formula you type          Value returned
   ----------------------------------------

   =10^-2147483648           #DIV/0!
   =10^-4294966989           1E+307
   =10^-4294967295           10
   =10^-(10^308)             10

</PRE>These formulas should all return the value 0, because the smallest
positive number allowed in Microsoft Excel is 9.99999999999999E-307,
which is just above 0.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, make sure that formulas in your
workbooks do not raise the value 10 to a power larger than 308 or smaller
than -308.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel supports positive values almost as large as 10^308 (a
one followed by 308 zeroes) and almost as small as 10^-308 (a decimal
point, followed by 308 zeroes and a one). Similar negative values are
also supported. Smaller values are rounded to 0, and larger values are
converted into a #NUM! error value.
<P>
For comparison, note that the estimated number of elementary particles in
the known universe is 10^80, or a one followed by 80 zeroes. The smallest
value used in physics is roughly 10^-33 centimeters, the scale at which
quantum fluctuations are believed to exist. These values are well within
the limits supported by Microsoft Excel; so, Microsoft Excel can work
with any meaningful number in the universe.
<P>
With respect to the largest formula shown above: Note that a googol is
10^100, or a 1 followed by 100 zeroes, and that a googolplex is 10^googol,
or a 1 followed by 10^100 zeroes.
<P>
The correct result of the third formula shown above, =10^(1E+308), is
a 1 followed by 10^308 zeroes. So, the result of the third formula is
equivalent to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   googolplex*googolplex*googolplex*(10^(10^8))

</PRE>So, it would take over (1 followed by 10^307 zeroes) universes to
contain (1 followed by 10^308 zeroes) elementary particles.
