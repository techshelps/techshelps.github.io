1. Q. I need to set up version 4.0 of Microsoft Excel for Windows
      on a network server. What is the best way to do this?

   A. Included with Microsoft Excel 4.0 is a text file that fully
      details how to set up and use Microsoft Excel on a network. This
      file, NETWORK.TXT, is located on the Setup disk and can be
      opened in any text editor. To open this file in Microsoft
      Windows Notepad:

      1. In the Accessories group in Program Manager, open the
         Notepad application.

      2. From the File menu, choose Open.

      3. Move to the drive that contains the Microsoft Excel 4.0
         Setup disk. Under File Name, select the NETWORK.TXT file,
         then choose the OK button. To print the file, choose Print
         from the File menu.

2. Q. During custom installation of version 4.0 of Microsoft Excel
      for Windows, I am given the opportunity to select which
      Microsoft Excel options I want. What are each of these options
      and why should I install them?

   A. There are eight options you can install during the Microsoft
      Excel 4.0 Setup program. A complete setup requires approximately
      11 MB of disk space. The following is an overview of the eight
      available options:

      Option 1. Microsoft Excel: This option installs the files
      necessary for using Microsoft Excel 4.0; however, some of these
      files are optional. You can select which files to install by
      choosing the Excel button and then selecting or clearing the
      appropriate check boxes. If you are installing Microsoft Excel
      4.0 for the first time, you must select the Microsoft Excel
      check box.

      Option 2. Macro Library: This option installs add-in macros that
      provided enhanced functionality in Microsoft Excel. By choosing
      the Library button, you can select which add-in macros you want
      to install. The options include an automatic document saving
      (Auto Save) macro, a Flatfile Export macro, and a Worksheet
      Auditing macro.

      Option 3. Microsoft Excel Solver: This option installs Microsoft
      Excel Solver, an easy-to-use companion application that allows
      for linear programming capability and complex "what if"
      analysis.

      Option 4. Analysis Toolpak: This option adds financial and
      engineering functions and provides tools for performing
      statistical and engineering analysis.

      Option 5. Microsoft Excel Tutorial: This option installs a
      series of online lessons that provide an excellent way to learn
      Microsoft Excel 4.0 interactively. For example, this option
      installs a set of sample worksheets that offer ideas on how to
      combine Microsoft Excel features to create powerful worksheets,
      macros, and models.

      Option 6. Dialog Editor: This option installs the Dialog Editor
      application. You can use the Dialog Editor to create dialog
      boxes for Microsoft Excel command macros and custom forms for
      entering database information.

      Option 7. Macro Translator: This option installs the Macro
      Translation Assistant, a utility that helps you translate your
      Lotus(R) 1-2-3(R) and Microsoft Multiplan(R) macros into
      Microsoft Excel 4.0 macros.

      Option 8. Q+E: Q+E for Microsoft Excel is an easy-to-use and
      powerful database application that allows you to manipulate and
      update database files from a variety of database systems,
      including dBASE(R), Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle(R).
