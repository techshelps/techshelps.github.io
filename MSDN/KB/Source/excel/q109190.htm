<PRE>1. Q. What are the new features in Microsoft Excel version 5.0
      for Windows?

   A. Microsoft Excel version 5.0 sets a new standard for
      spreadsheets. Built-in intelligence and innovative features let
      you focus on your analysis, not your data. And rich, custom-
      development tools help you build the solutions you want. It all
      adds up to an intelligent spreadsheet that works the way it
      should--the way you want.

      Microsoft Excel is the spreadsheet that works the way you want
      to, so your work is easier. That's because as a member of the
      Microsoft Office family of programs, Microsoft Excel features
      IntelliSense(TM) technology: built-in intelligence that senses
      what you want to do and helps you do it--so routine tasks are
      automatic and complex jobs are easier. IntelliSense redefines
      ease of use with automatic features and wizards that step you
      through tasks. And if there's a more effective way of working,
      Microsoft Excel even suggests tips through the revolutionary
      new TipWizard(TM)  assistant to save you time and expand your
      knowledge of Microsoft Excel.

      You'll also find that you'll have complete control over
      everything in your spreadsheet. Now you can directly enter and
      edit information in cells and manipulate data and charts,
      giving you a faster and easier way to do your work. Microsoft
      Excel introduces a new way to work with data that lets you
      instantly create dynamic views and reports of your data, so you
      can spend time analyzing, rather than accessing and setting up
      information. And you can develop your own solutions with easy-
      to-use tools to customize your spreadsheet and rich development
      tools to build powerful enterprise solutions.

      Microsoft Excel also features OfficeLinks, which let you work
      with other programs, as well as with others in your workgroup,
      so you can include the most recent information in your
      analysis. And best of all, Microsoft Excel is part of the
      family of Microsoft Office programs that work alike and work
      together, so when you learn one, you're on your way to learning
      them all. With Microsoft Excel, you can focus on your work,
      rather than your computer. Maybe that's why it's the most
      popular spreadsheet for Windows.

      Gain Visual and Direct Control
      ------------------------------

       - Enter and edit information by typing it directly into cells.
         Click a cell to change the font size, the character
         formatting, the color, size, or orientation, of any part of
         the entry.

       - Select and build formulas with the Function Wizard--it helps
         you build formulas, assists you with arguments, and lists
         your most recently used functions.

       - Click the right mouse button to see context-sensitive
         shortcut menus.

       - Manipulate individual or groups of cells more easily by
         clicking the right mouse button or by dragging data. It's a
         fast way to cut, copy, and paste data.

       - Tab dialog boxes combine your options into one intuitive box,
         so you don't have to go searching through different menus.

       - Every file is a workbook that contains as many related sheets
         as you like. Workbook tabs make it easier to navigate through
         and select these sheets.

       - Workbooks let you simultaneously edit or format multiple sheets.

       - Quickly understand linked worksheets and errors with the new
         auditing tools. With one click, Microsoft Excel traces formulas
         to give you a visual representation of the formulas in a
         worksheet, and traces formula errors to their origin.

       - Identify buttons and toolbars quickly with ToolTips. Modify
         button images right in Microsoft Excel with the new Button
         Editor. If you're using a high-resolution graphics adapter, you
         can switch to the new Large Buttons option.

      IntelliSense Technology Lets You Do More with Less Effort
      ---------------------------------------------------------

       - Take advantage of a built-in, personal coach. TipWizard watches
         you as you work and gives you tips on how to work faster and
         smarter.

       - Leave the adding to Microsoft Excel. The AutoSum(TM) feature
         intelligently sums ranges and can sum rows and columns
         simultaneously.

       - Save time and effort typing in commonly entered data. The
         AutoFill feature recognizes trends in numbers and dates, and
         intelligently extends the selected series. Use the custom
         AutoFill feature to add your own series.

       - Make every worksheet look professional instantly with the
         AutoFormat feature. Take advantage of a number of existing
         formats, such as the accounting autoformats.

       - View a subset of your information with the AutoFilter command.
         Microsoft Excel provides you with a list of choices so that you
         can select the type of data you want to see.

       - Sort data easily and flexibly with the Sort buttons or define
         custom sort orders.

       - Choose the Subtotals command to automatically generate subtotals
         for your data.

       - Use the Auto Outline command to create reports at any level of
         detail with a few mouse clicks.

      Plot Your Data So That It Appears the Way You Want It to Appear
      ---------------------------------------------------------------

       - Create meaningful charts from your data with the ChartWizard
         (which walks you through the chart-creation process and
         makes it easy for you to choose your own options).

       - Manipulate chart formats to get the exact chart layout you
         want: you can directly select, resize, and format parts of
         your chart, such as the legend, title, and plot area.

       - Update your chart instantly by dragging new data to the
         chart. The new information is automatically plotted for you.

       - Save preferred chart formats with a custom autoformat. Then
         reapply the entire format with a mouse click.

       - Mix chart types into one chart with combination charts. You
         can apply a different chart type for each series. For
         example, you can plot the values for "Revenue" on a line and
         values for "Expenses" in a column on the same chart.

       - Use the Trendline command to create a best-fit line and
         perform automatic forecasting.

      Discover a New Way to Analyze Data
      ----------------------------------

      The PivotTable(TM) Wizard steps you through building a summary
      table of your data that you can use to:

       - View and analyze data.

       - Build different reports and views by dragging and dropping
         headings any way you like.

       - Take the monotony out of your analysis with automatic
         calculations such as comparisons, averages, and percentages
         of totals.

       - Use the Grouping features to combine data.

      Easily Share Files and Work with Others
      ---------------------------------------

      Effectively work with others with the Workgroup toolbar:

       - The Find File button makes it easy to search for files by
         name, author, or date.

       - Interactive file sharing lets you share files, notifies you
         when files are available, and updates read-only files with
         the most recent changes.

       - The Send Mail button allows you to send mail right from
         Microsoft Excel and include files as attachments.

       - Use the Routing Slip button to send documents individually
         or to an entire team.

       - You can route documents individually in the order you
         specify, or all at once. You are notified as revisions are
         completed and are updated about a document's routing
         progress.

       - Take advantage of an improved Scenario Manager. Now you can
         create what-if scenarios on multiple ranges of cells and
         view and access those scenarios from a list on the Workgroup
         toolbar. You can even merge scenarios from others in your
         workgroup.

       - Make a summary report of your scenario by creating a
         PivotTable of your scenarios. Analyze the impact of
         different scenarios by pivoting your summary report.

      Access and Retrieve Data Easily
      -------------------------------

       - Save time by using the TextWizard to import files exactly
         the way you want.

       - Import data to Microsoft Excel with Microsoft Query.
         Microsoft Query supports open database connectivity (ODBC),
         which provides connections to a wide range of external data.

      Customize Your Worksheet
      ------------------------

       - Place controls directly on your worksheet to automate your
         work without macros.

       - Customize your toolbars easily.

       - Use the macro recorder to automate your tasks with the new
         Visual Basic(R) Programming System, Applications Edition,
         language or with the Microsoft Excel 4.0 macro language.

      Make Your Spreadsheet Part of a Complete Solution
      -------------------------------------------------

       - Create more-powerful programs easily with the common macro
         language Microsoft Visual Basic Programming System,
         Applications Edition. This one language allows you to build
         custom solutions for multiple programs.

       - Support for object linking and embedding (OLE) 2.0 lets
         Microsoft Excel work with other programs toward your
         solutions.

      Learn Microsoft Excel Using Your Lotus(R) 1-2-3(R) Experience
      -------------------------------------------------------------

       - You can use familiar 1-2-3 commands and the Lotus 1-2-3
         transition options to demonstrate equivalent Microsoft Excel
         commands.

       - Transfer files without losing file compatibility with Lotus
         WKS, WK1, WK3, Impress, Allways(TM), Multiplan(R), and
         Quattro(R) Pro for the MS-DOS operating system.

       - Transfer existing files more easily with improved 3-D
         capabilities.

       - Use the Macro Interpreter for Lotus 1-2-3 to run all release
         2.01 and most release 2.2 and 2.3 macros unmodified.

      The Microsoft Office Family: A Whole New Way to Work
      ----------------------------------------------------

      Go further with a family. The Microsoft Office family is a set
      of essential, full-featured programs for Windows. It includes
      Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access(R), Microsoft
      PowerPoint(R), Microsoft Mail, Microsoft Project, and Microsoft
      Schedule+. It also includes Microsoft Office Standard and
      Professional, the most popular office suites on the market
      today.

      Consistency redefined. All programs in the Microsoft Office
      family look and work alike with common menus, commands, and
      toolbars. When you learn one program, you're well on your way
      to learning them all.

      Beyond ease of use. Only the programs in the Microsoft Office
      family have IntelliSense, built-in intelligence that
      anticipates what you want to do and responds with suggestions,
      examples, and shortcuts that reduce steps and save time.
      Routine tasks are automated and complex jobs become easier.

      Beyond cut and paste. Now it's truly easy to create, edit, and
      publish documents because OfficeLinks enable all programs in
      the Microsoft Office family to work together as if they were a
      single program. Move information between programs with a simple
      drag of the mouse. Edit information brought in from one program
      while you're working in another. And easily work with others in
      your group using built-in workgroup routing and editing
      features.

        - EGA or higher-resolution monitor compatible with Microsoft
          Windows 3.1 or later

        - Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device (mouse
          recommended)

4. Q. How do I install Microsoft Excel for Windows on a network
      server so that workstations can run Setup from the server?

   A. For detailed information about how to set up and administer
      Microsoft Excel on a network, see the NETWORK.TXT file on Setup
      Disk 1. To view and print this file:

      1. From the Accessories group in Program Manager, start
         Notepad.

      2. From the File menu, choose Open.

      3. Switch to the drive that contains your Microsoft Excel 5.0
         Setup disk, select NETWORK.TXT, and choose OK.

      4. From the Edit menu, choose Word Wrap.

      5. If you want to print the document, choose the Print command
         from the File menu.

5. Q. When I run the Setup program for Microsoft Excel for
      Windows, there are several options to choose from. What do
      these options mean?

   A. When you run the setup program for Microsoft Excel 5.0, you can
      choose a Typical, Complete/Custom, or Laptop (Minimum) setup.

      include: the Microsoft Excel program, Help files, Tutorial,
      Data Access, Graphics Filters, Add-ins, and Tools. To reduce
      the amount of disk space an option requires, select the option
      and choose the Change Option button. You can then select the
      components you want to install. The Complete/Custom option
      requires up to 23 MB. The Typical setup option installs
      everything except the Data Access component and requires
      approximately 19 MB. The Notebook setup option requires only 8
      MB because it installs only those files necessary to run
      Microsoft Excel.

6. Q. If I run low on disk space, how do I uninstall specific
      components of Microsoft Excel for Windows?

   A. Once you've installed Microsoft Excel, you can run the Setup
      program at any time to add or remove supplementary applications
      or files. To run the Setup program:

      1. Quit Microsoft Excel if it is currently open.

      2. Double-click the Microsoft Excel Setup icon (this icon
         should be located in the same Program Manager group as your
         Microsoft Excel program icon).

      3. Choose the Add/Remove button.

      4. Clear the option check boxes for the components that you
         want to remove and select the items you want to add and
         choose the Continue button.
