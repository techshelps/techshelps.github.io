The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.x, 5.x
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0

</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive one of the following errors when attempting to save a
document in Microsoft Excel:
<P>
<PRE>  - Cannot access read-only document &lt;filename&gt;

    -or-

</PRE><LI>Disk is full
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Document not saved
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Document not completely saved
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Document not saved. Any previously saved copy has been deleted
<P>
</UL>The document is not saved.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The process that Microsoft Excel uses to save changes to an existing file
is interrupted.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a file that you changed in some way on a Windows-based
computer, Microsoft Excel saves the file with a temporary file name and
places this file in the same folder as the original file. The original file
is then deleted and the temporary file is renamed with the original file
name.
<P>
If this process is somehow interrupted, your file may not be saved properly
or you may find one or more temporary files in the folder where you tried
to save your file. In addition, you may receive one of several alert or
error messages.
<P>
When you use Microsoft Excel to save a file that you changed in some way on
a Macintosh-based computer, and the program unexpectedly quits, Microsoft
Excel saves the file with a temporary file name. Temporary files are placed
in an invisible folder called Temporary Items in the root level of the hard
disk. When Microsoft Excel unexpectedly quits, this folder becomes visible.
When you restart the computer, this folder is moved to the Trash and placed
in a folder called "Rescued Items from &lt;hard disk name&gt;." You can then drag
the file back to the hard disk to recover it.
<P>
The following information lists some of the possible messages you may
receive and explanations as to why you may receive them.

<UL><LI>"Cannot access read-only document &lt;filename&gt;"
<P>
   The drive you are saving to is a network drive and you don't have
   sufficient privileges to save to that drive. Try saving to your
   local hard drive or to a floppy disk drive.

<LI>"Disk is full"
<P>
   The drive you are saving to doesn't have enough space for the
   temporary file. Delete some files from the current drive and save
   to another drive or to a floppy disk drive.

<LI>"Document not saved," or "Document not completely saved"
<P>
   The process was interrupted while creating the temporary file,
   either because you pressed the ESC key or because there was some
   hardware or software failure or other media problem. The original file
   is still intact and unless your computer or workstation failed, the
   version of the file containing your current changes is still open
   in memory. Save the file to an alternate drive. If your computer or
   workstation did fail, you can use the original file. (Note that any
   changes made in the last revision will be lost.)

<LI>"Document not saved. Any previously saved copy has been deleted"
<P>
   The process was interrupted while deleting the original or renaming the
   temporary file. This problem will occur for the same reasons described
   in the scenario described in the "'Document not saved,' or 'Document not
   completely saved'" section of this article. In this case, your original
   file is gone (though the temporary file may be readable). If your
   computer or workstation failed, use the temporary file. If the
   interruption was caused by something else, the version of the file
   containing your current changes is still open in memory. Save the file
   to an alternate drive.
