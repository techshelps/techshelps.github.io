<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a worksheet in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, you may
receive an error message similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   A formula in a cell (Cell:B5) could not be converted because it
   contains a function that is not available in the file format to which
   you are saving. If you continue the save, the formula and result will
   be saved, but the function itself will be converted to an error value.

</PRE>You receive this error message even though the worksheet does not contain
any functions that are not available in this file format.
<P>
When you reopen the file, the formula in the indicated cell is gone. Only
the value returned by the formula remains in the cell.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are saving the active worksheet in the Lotus 1-2-3 WK1 format.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The worksheet you are saving contains at least one formula that uses the
   COUNT function.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Before you save the worksheet, replace all references to the COUNT
   function with references to the COUNTA function. The problem described
   in this article does not occur when the worksheet contains formulas that
   use the COUNTA function.
<P>
   You can quickly convert all of the references by following these steps:
<P>
   1. On the Edit menu, click Replace.
<P>
   2. In the Find What box, type "COUNT" (without the quotation marks).
<P><PRE>      In the Replace With box, type "COUNTA" (without the quotation
      marks). Click to select the Match Case check box, and then click
      Replace All.
</PRE><P>
   All references to COUNT are converted to references to COUNTA.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Save the worksheet in the Lotus 1-2-3 WK3 or WK4 format. When you do
   this, the problem does not occur.
<P>
</UL>For more information about the COUNT and COUNTA functions, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q165260.htm">Q165260</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL97: COUNTA Function Changed to COUNT

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the COUNT function to count the number of numbers in a range of
cells. The COUNTA function allows you to count the number of nonblank cells
in a range of cells. For example, if you have the following data
<P>
<PRE>   A1: 1
   A2: 2
   A3:
   A4: x
   A5: y

</PRE>the formula =COUNT(A1:A5) returns the value 2. This is true because there
are two numbers in the range of cells. The formula =COUNTA(A1:A5) returns
the value 4 because there are four nonblank cells in the range.
<P>
The COUNT and COUNTA functions are supported by all versions of Lotus
1-2-3, so you should not receive an error message when you save a worksheet
that contains the COUNT function in the WK1 format.
