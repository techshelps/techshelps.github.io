<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In a dialog box in Microsoft Excel, you can click the question mark (the
What's This? button), and then click an item in the dialog box to see a
Help topic about that item. This kind of Help is called context-sensitive
Help.
<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, context-sensitive Help is available
for items in the Control tab of the Format Control dialog box.
<P>
The Help information that is not available in the Format Control dialog box
is listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   Item                      Help information
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   3D Shading                To give the selected control a three-
                             dimensional appearance, select the 3D
                             Shading check box.

   Cell Link                 To link the value of the selected control to
                             on a worksheet, either type the cell address
                             in the Cell Link box; or place the insertion
                             point in this box, and then select a cell.

   Current Value             To set the initial value for the selected
                             scroll bar or spinner, type an integer in
                             the Current Value box. This integer must
                             fall between the Minimum Value and Maximum
                             Value you set for this control.

                             the drop-down portion of the selected drop-
                             down list box, type a number in the Drop
                             Down Lines box. If the number you specify is
                             less than the number of items in the list, a
                             scroll bar appears to the right of the
                             list.

   Incremental Change        To specify how much the value of the
                             selected scroll bar or spinner changes when
                             the user clicks one of its arrows, type an
                             integer in the Incremental Change box.

   Input Range               To fill the selected list box with the
                             contents of a range of cells on a worksheet,
                             either type the range address in the Input
                             Range box; or place the insertion point in
                             this box, and then select a range.

                             the Maximum Value box. The value in this box
                             must be greater than the value in the
                             Minimum Value box.

   Minimum Value             To set the minimum value for the selected
                             scroll bar or spinner, type an integer in
                             the Minimum Value box. The value in this box
                             must be less than the value in the Maximum
                             Value box.

                             selected scroll bar changes when the user
                             clicks inside the scroll bar on either side
                             of the scroll box, type an integer in the

                             select or deselect an individual item by
                             holding down CTRL and clicking the item.

                             able to select any assortment of items in
                             the list. The user must select and deselect
                             items one at a time.

                             check box or option button to on, click

                             check box or option button to off, click
