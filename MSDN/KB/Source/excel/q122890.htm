The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet that is opened in Microsoft Excel and contains
links to Lotus 1-2-3 source worksheets will maintain these links. These
links will still be maintained if the dependent worksheet is exported to a
Microsoft Excel workbook.
<P>
You can also export the Lotus 1-2-3 source worksheet to a Microsoft Excel
workbook. The links to the 1-2-3 source document from a dependent worksheet
will automatically change over to the newly converted Microsoft Excel
workbook provided that the dependent sheet is open when the source sheet is
converted to Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>To export a dependent Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet to Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
A Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet that is opened in Microsoft Excel will maintain any
links it has to Lotus 1-2-3 source worksheets. If this worksheet is
exported to a Microsoft Excel workbook these links will be maintained. To
export the dependent worksheet use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save As.

<P><LI>Enter a name for the worksheet and select Microsoft Excel Workbook in
   the Save File As Type box. Choose OK or press ENTER.
<P>
</OL><h3>To export a Lotus 1-2-3 source worksheet to Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
To export a Lotus 1-2-3 source worksheet to a Microsoft Excel workbook and
have all dependent Microsoft Excel workbooks automatically change dependent
links to the new Microsoft Excel workbooks, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open all dependent worksheets.

<P><LI>Open the Lotus 1-2-3 source worksheet.

<P><LI>With the Lotus 1-2-3 source worksheet active, choose Save As from the
   File menu.

<P><LI>Enter a name for the worksheet and select Microsoft Excel Workbook in
   the Save File As Type box. Choose OK or press ENTER.

<P><LI>Save all of the dependent worksheets.
<P>
</OL>If a dependent worksheet was not open when the source worksheet was
exported to a Microsoft Excel workbook, its dependent links will still
point to the Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet. Links in the dependent sheet that still
point to a Lotus 1-2-3 source worksheet can be changed to point to a
Microsoft Excel 5.0 workbook by using the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Close the Microsoft Excel workbook that is going to become the new
   source document.

<P><LI>Open the dependent document.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Links.

<P><LI>Select the source file in which you want to change the link.

<P><LI>Choose the Change Source button.

<P><LI>Select the Microsoft Excel workbook that you want to be the new source
   workbook.

<P><LI>Choose OK.
