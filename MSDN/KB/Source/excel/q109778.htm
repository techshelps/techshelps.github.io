   TITLE     : PRJ41: "Could Not Initialize VBA", "Timer Driver Not
               Installed"

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>If You Are Running Microsoft Excel Under Windows</h3>
 
<P>
Method 1: Use these steps, based upon the version of Microsoft Excel you
<PRE>          are running, to verify that the files are correctly
          installed and that the SYSTEM.INI contains the appropriate
          entries:

          1. Make sure the SYSTEM.INI file contains the correct lines
             for MMSYSTEM.DLL, VTDAPI.386, and TIMER.DRV. The lines are
             as follows:

             NOTE: Make sure that you do not have trailing spaces on any
             of the following lines.

          Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and 7.0
          ------------------------------------

             a. In the [BOOT] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, the
                following line is  required:

                   drivers=mmsystem.dll

                This line specifies which drivers to load when you start
                Microsoft Windows, so additional drivers may be listed
                on this line. For example, the line may read:

                   drivers=mmsystem.dll pen penwindows

                For additional information about this line, see the
                PJREADME.HLP file that is installed with Microsoft
                Project.

             Microsoft Excel version 5.0
             ---------------------------

             b. In the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, the
                following line is required:

                   device=vtdapi.386

             c. In the [drivers] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, the
                following line is required:

                   timer=timer.drv

          Windows 95
          ----------

          2. Make sure the MMSYSTEM.DLL file is loaded on your computer.
             This file should be located in your \Windows\System
             folder. If the file does not exist on your computer, do
             the following to extract it from your Windows disks:

             a. Copy Extract.exe from the "Disk 1 -Setup" disk to the
                root directory of your hard drive.

             b. On the Start menu point to Programs and then click
                MS-DOS Prompt.

             c. In the MS-DOS Prompt window, change to your root
                directory.

             d. Insert Disk 8 of your Windows 95 disks and type the
                following at the command prompt:

             extract a:\Win95_08.cab /L c:\Windows\System Mmsystem.dll

             e. After the Extract program finishes extracting the file
                to your computer, type the following at the command
                prompt:

                exit

             f. Eject Disk 8 from your floppy drive and restart your
                computer.

          Windows version 3.1, and Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
          ------------------------------------------------------------

          2. Make sure the files TIMER.DRV, MMSYSTEM.DLL, and VTDAPI.386
             are loaded on your computer. All three files should be
             located in your \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. If the files do
             not exist on your computer, expand them from your Windows
             disks. Check your computer for duplicate filenames, and
             rename as needed.

             To expand the files, do the following:

             a. Exit windows to the MS-DOS prompt.

             b. Change to the WINDOWS directory.

             c. In drive A, insert the disk that contains the file that
                you want to expand:

                Microsoft Windows version 3.1
                -----------------------------

                TIMER.DRV is located on Disk 3 (Windows 3.1), Disk 5
                (Windows 3.11)

                MMSYSTEM.DLL is located on Disk 4 (Windows 3.1 and 3.11)
                VTDAPI.386 is located on Disk 3 (Windows 3.1), Disk 5
                (Windows 3.11)

                Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11
                ----------------------------------------------

                TIMER.DRV is located on Disk 5 (Disk 7 if 5.25-inch
                disks)

                MMSYSTEM.DLL is located on Disk 4

                VTDAPI.386 is located on Disk 5 (Disk 7 if 5.25-inch
                disks)

             d. At the MS-DOS command prompt, do the following to expand
                the files (assuming your Windows disk is in drive A):

                To Expand TIMER.DRV, type the following:

                    Expand a:\timer.dr_ c:\windows\system\timer.drv

                To Expand MMSYSTEM.DLL, type the following:

                    Expand a:\mmsystem.dl_ c:\windows\system\mmsystem.dll

                To Expand VTDAPI.386, type the following:

                    Expand a:\vtdapi.38_ c:\windows\system\vtdapi.386

          Other things to look for:

           - If the SYSTEM.INI file contains the correct lines and
             TIMER.DRV, MMSYSTEM.DLL, and VTDAPI.386 are all on your
             system in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory, it may be possible
             that one or all of the files is damaged. In this case,
             delete the existing TIMER.DRV, MMSYSTEM.DLL, and VTDAPI.386
             files and expand them from your Windows disks using the
             instructions from step 2 above.

           - It is possible to have Windows directories on more than one
             drive. This may cause Setup to copy files to the wrong
             directory. In this case, make sure the path is pointing to
             the proper directory, and that the correct files are
             located in the \Windows\System directory.

           - Try commenting out the "LOAD=" and "RUN=" lines in WIN.INI
             by adding a semicolon (;) at the beginning of each line.
             Also, try removing ALL icons from the Program Manager
             Startup group. Once these changes have been made, exit and
             restart Windows.


           - This can also occur if a directory is in the path prior to
             the Windows directory that contains one of these files. A
             Dos search for all instances of "Timer.drv", "mmsystem.dll",
             and "Vtdapi.386" will  assist in the resolution of this issue.
             From a MS-DOS command prompt at the root of "C:", type the
             following:

                  Dir Timer.drv /s

             to search all the  subdirectories. Change your path statement
             and have your Windows directory be first.

</PRE>Method 2: Determine if a driver has created or modified entries in the
<PRE>          [386Enh], [Boot], or [Drivers] sections of the SYSTEM.INI file
          (and that this modification is causing the problem).

          To do this, remark these entries out (type a semicolon at the
          beginning of each driver entry), and make sure that the
          appropriate entries are included in each section of the
          SYSTEM.INI file (for information about these entries, see step 1
          in "Method 1" above).

          Note that commenting these lines out may prevent you from running
          a certain application or utility.

          The following table includes specific examples of drivers that
          may create entries in the [386Enh], [Boot], or [Drivers] sections
          of the SYSTEM.INI and, subsequently, may cause these error
          messages. The table also contains suggestions about how you may
          be able to avoid the error messages.

          For this       Using this
          Product        Driver        Make this modification

          program                      sections and ensure that it
                                       contains the appropriate drivers=
                                       entry.

</PRE>Method 3: If Windows is not installed correctly.
<P>
<PRE>          If you attempted to install Windows version 3.1 over Windows
          version 3.0, and the installation failed, the following line will
          appear in the [Boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

             oldshell=progman.exe

          and this line will appear in the [Drivers] section of the
          SYSTEM.INI file:

             olddrivers=mmsystem.dll

          To correct this problem, edit the SYSTEM.INI file and remove the
          "old" prefix from both of these lines so that they appear as
          follows:

             shell=progman.exe

          and:

             drivers=mmsystem.dll

          Also, make sure that there are no lines in the SYSTEM.INI that
          look like this:

             ;drivers=mmsystem.dll

          If such lines exist, remove them from the SYSTEM.INI file.

</PRE><h3>If You Are Running Microsoft Excel Under OS/2</h3>
 
<P>
If you receive a TIMER.DRV error message and you are running Microsoft
Excel 5.0 under OS/2, you will have to add the TIMER.DRV file to the
system, because it is not installed for the OS/2 Windows emulation by
default. Install the driver in a Windows session, using the Drivers icon in
Control Panel.
