1. Q. How do I upgrade Microsoft Excel version 2.0 for Windows to
      Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for Windows? What new features are
      included in Microsoft Excel 3.0?

   A. The latest version of Microsoft Excel for Windows is now
      4.0. To order Microsoft Excel version 4.0 or 3.0 for Windows,
      please call Microsoft Consumer Sales at (800) 426-9400, select
      Individual or Business User, and request information on upgrade
      procedures. The hours for Microsoft Consumer Sales are 6:30 A.M.
      to 5:30 P.M. Pacific time.

      The new features of Microsoft Excel 3.0 include an on-screen
      tool bar that expedites the most common spreadsheet tasks,
      drawing tools to enhance your presentations, and 68 chart
      options, including 24 3-D charts. Microsoft Excel 3.0 lets you
      use up to 16 different colors on a single worksheet or chart,
      with over 16 million colors to choose from! Microsoft Excel 3.0
      also allows you to combine worksheets, charts, and text on a
      single page; define documents as templates; and paste graphic
      objects, such as clip art, onto worksheets. Microsoft Excel 3.0
      can also access up to 16 megabytes (MB) of memory, greatly
      reducing the likelihood of running out of memory while you are
      using your worksheets and charts.

      Microsoft Excel 3.0 includes Q+E(TM) for easy database
      manipulation and Microsoft Solver, an application that can help
      you solve complex mathematical models. Extensive help for
      Lotus(R) 1-2-3(R) users is also available, making it easy for
      Lotus users to quickly become productive using Excel. Microsoft
      Excel 3.0 can import data from Lotus 1-2-3, dBASE(R), Microsoft
      Excel 2.0, Microsoft Excel for OS/2(R), and Microsoft Excel for
      the Macintosh(R).

      For a complete list of features in Microsoft Excel 3.0 or 4.0,
      please call Microsoft Consumer Sales at (800) 426-9400.

2. Q. What are the minimum hardware and software requirements for
      Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for Windows?

   A. To run Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for Windows, you need the
      following:

       - An IBM(R) PC/AT(R) or compatible, or IBM PS/2(R), with
         an 80286 or faster processor.

       - 1 MB of RAM memory. 1 MB, as used here, is defined as
         640K of conventional memory plus 384K of extended memory.
         However, 2 MB or more of RAM memory is strongly recommended.

       - MS-DOS or PC-DOS version 3.1 or later.

       - Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.0 or later
         running in standard or 386 enhanced mode.

       - An IBM-compatible EGA, VGA, 8514/A, or any video adapter
         supported by Windows 3.0, except CGA.

       - A hard disk with 5.2 MB of available space.

       - A 5.25-inch or a 3.5-inch floppy disk drive. Microsoft
         Excel 3.0 ships on high-density 5.25-inch, 1.2 MB disks or
         3.5-inch, 1.44 MB disks; low-density disks are available upon
         request by calling Microsoft Consumer Sales at (800) 4269400.

       - A mouse is optional but highly recommended. Some
         Microsoft Excel 3.0 features require a mouse.
