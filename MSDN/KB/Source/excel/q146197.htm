</UL><h2>THE MICROSOFT EXCEL MANUAL</h2>
 
<P>
The "Getting Results with Microsoft Excel for Windows 95" manual has
been redesigned to help you find the information you need to complete
your tasks quickly in Microsoft Excel 7.0. If you are using an earlier
version of Microsoft Excel, refer to the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide"
manuals.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Find Information in the Manual</h3>
 
<P>
The easiest way to find information in the manual is to look in the
Contents at the front of the book for the title that pertains to the
task at hand. The Contents lists sixteen broad categories that describe
usage categories for Microsoft Excel.
<P>
If you do not find a topic in the Contents, flip to the back of the
book and look in the Index. If you are not sure what the task is
called, take a guess as to the name of the task or feature, find the
word, and turn to the page referenced in the Index.
<P>
If you are unable to find any pertinent information, broaden your
criteria and look for words in the index that relate to the broader
topic.
