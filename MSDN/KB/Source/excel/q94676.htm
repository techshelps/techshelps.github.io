<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If Microsoft Excel for Windows is unable to read from your hard disk, you
will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Application Error: Excel has caused a segment load failure in
   module EXCEL.EXE at xxxx:yyyy

</PRE>This error may indicate one of the following:

<UL><LI>The EXCEL.EXE file did not expand properly during setup
<P>
   -or-

<LI>A memory conflict exists
<P>
   -or-

<LI>A hardware problem has occurred
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>The EXCEL.EXE File Did Not Expand Properly During Setup</h3>
 
<P>
If you received the error message the first time you tried to run
Microsoft Excel after installing it, the EXCEL.EXE file may not have
been expanded properly. You will find this file in the directory in
which you installed Microsoft Excel. Use Windows File Manager to
ensure that the file date and size match one of the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Excel version 4.0:

       4/1/92  2740736
      11/1/92  2766592

   Microsoft Excel version 5.0:

     12/14/93  4185600

   Microsoft Excel version 5.0c:

       7/8/94  4246784

</PRE>If the file date and size do not match any of the above dates and
sizes, delete EXCEL.EXE and reinstall Microsoft Excel. When you
reinstall, you can avoid installing all of the other Microsoft Excel
files by choosing Custom Installation and selecting the Microsoft
Excel only option.
<P>
<P><h3>A Memory Conflict Exists</h3>
 
<P>
If your EXCEL.EXE file appears to have the right date and file size,
clean boot your machine. For more information on clean booting, see
pages 99-100 of the "Getting Started with Microsoft Windows" version
3.1 manual, and pages 528-531 of the version 3.1 "Microsoft Windows
Users Guide."
<P>
In Microsoft Windows, try closing down all other applications. In
addition, clear the 32-Bit Access check box. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>In the Windows Control Panel, choose the 386 Enhanced icon.

<P><LI>Choose the Virtual Memory button.

<P><LI>Choose the Change button, and clear the 32-bit Access check box.
<P>
</OL>If you are using a third-party disk-compression utility, verify that
your Microsoft Windows swapfile, whether temporary or permanent, is on
your non-compressed drive. For more information about checking and
changing your swapfile settings, see pages 533-537 of the "Microsoft
Windows Users Guide."
<P>
CAUTION: Quit Windows before you try the following procedure.
<P>
If you still receive the error, type "CHKDSK /f" (without the
quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt. This will fix your file
allocation table. If there are many lost clusters reported, your hard
drive may be fragmented and in need of optimization. You can use a
hard drive utilities application to optimize your drive.
<P>
<P><h3>A Hardware Problem Has Occurred</h3>
 
<P>
If the error persists, you may also need to run diagnostic tests on
your hard drive and hard drive controller.
<P>
NOTE: There are a variety of utility products on the market that you
can use to run diagnostic tests and optimize your drive. For more
information about these utility products, consult your computer dealer
or service representative.
