<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Conditional Sum Wizard is part of a series of add-on wizards that
Microsoft is making available to enhance your use of Microsoft Excel. The
Conditional Sum Wizard helps you to write formulas that calculate the sum
of values that meet specified conditions.
<P>
Note: The Conditional Sum Wizard is included with Excel 97 for Windows and
Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
The add-in in this article is provided "as is" and Microsoft does not
guarantee that it can be used in all situations. Although Microsoft
Technical Support Engineers can help with the installation and existing
functionality of this add-in, they will not modify the add-in to provide
new functionality.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Conditional Sum Wizard aids in writing formulas that will sum a set of
values that meet specified conditions. This wizard provides a user
interface to create SUM-IF formulas. Below is a detailed description of
each step in the Wizard, followed by an example.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 1 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
In this step, you need to specify the range of cells containing the data
that will be used for the formula. This range must include column headings
and the cells containing the condition parameters. For the most part, this
means selecting the entire list on the worksheet.
<P>
Like most of the Microsoft Excel add-ins, the dialog box opens with the
Range Edit box filled in. Microsoft Excel (versions 5.0 and later) is
designed to determine where your list is. If the range is not filled in
correctly, you must change it by selecting the correct range (with the
mouse) or by typing it in manually.
<P>
NOTE: It is important to have column headings in the data range specified
in this step. The column headings are used in the following steps of the
wizard.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 2 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
First, you need to determine what values to sum if all the specified
conditions are met. There is a drop-down list that contains all the column
headings in the data range that you specified in Step 1. From this list,
choose the column that will be used for the sum.
<P>
Second, you need to specify the conditions for the sum. Each condition will
have a condition parameter (column heading), an operator, and a value. For
each condition, select a condition parameter and an operator from the lists
that are provided. You can either select the value for the condition from
the provided list or you can type in the value. After you set up each
condition, click the Add Condition button to add it to the list of
conditions. If you make a mistake or if you need to change a condition, use
the Delete Condition button.
<P>
<P><h3>Step 3 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
In step 3, the wizard is ready to copy the formula to the worksheet. The
wizard provides options for how it copies the formula to the worksheet. You
can choose either of the following options:

<UL><LI>Copy only the sum that results from the current parameters.
<P>
   This copies the formula to the worksheet. This is selected by default.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Include current parameters in the worksheet, so that they can easily be
   changed.
<P>
   This copies the formula as well as the values of the condition
   parameters to the worksheet. If you choose this option, you can change
   the values of the condition parameters without having to modify the
   formula or go through the Wizard again.
<P>
</UL><h3>Step 4 of the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The information needed in this step varies depending on which option you
choose in step 3 of the wizard. Do either of the following steps:

<UL><LI>If you chose the first option (that is, copy only the sum that results
   from the current parameters), in this step you need to provide the cell
   reference of where the formula is to be placed on the worksheet. You can
   select the cell with the mouse, or you can type in the cell reference.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>If you chose the second option in step 3 of the wizard (that is, include
   current parameters in the worksheet), you need to provide the cell
   reference where the first condition parameter value will be placed. You
   can select the cell with the mouse or you can type in the cell
   reference. The wizard contains an additional step for each condition
   that you specified in Step 2 of the wizard. Finally, you are asked for a
   cell reference for where to place the formula.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Using the Conditional Sum Wizard does not increase the limit of seven
nested IF functions in Microsoft Excel. The Wizard disables the Add
Condition button when you reach the limit of seven conditions.

   A15: South  B15: 1/31/96  C15: $199,980.15  D15: Mary Jones

</PRE><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Conditional Sum Wizard.

<P><LI>In Step 1 of the wizard, the range $A$1:$D$15 should be filled in. If it
   is not, please type in the correct range. Click Next.

<P><LI>In Step 2 of the wizard, select Total Sales as the column to sum and add
   the following conditions:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Sales Representative = Mary Jones
      Date &gt; 1/10/96
</PRE><P>
   Click the Next button.

<P><LI>In Step 3 of the wizard, select "No. Copy only the sum that results from
   the current parameters." Click the Next button.

<P><LI>In Step 4, the cell reference on the worksheet to copy the formula
   to is $E$1. Click the Finish button. The answer in E1 will be
   $329,815.13, and the formula will be:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {=SUM(IF($B$2:$B$15&gt;DATEVALUE("1/10/96"),IF($D$2:$D$15="Mary
      Jones",$C$2:$C$15,0),0))}
