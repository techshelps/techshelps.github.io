The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a workbook in Microsoft Excel 97, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This file was created by a later version of Microsoft Excel. To open
   this file, you need a converter that you can download from the Web
   site. After downloading the converter, please restart Microsoft Excel
   and reopen the file.

   Do you want to connect to the site to download the converter now?

</PRE>If you click Yes, your Web browser connects to the Internet and opens the
following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/excel/work.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/excel/work.htm</A></B>

</PRE>If you click No, you receive an error message similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;File name&gt;: file format is not valid.

</PRE>When you view the Web page, there is no information about a converter for a
later version of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
No version later than Microsoft Excel 97 is available; therefore, you
receive this error message only if the workbook you are attempting to open
is corrupted or damaged. Microsoft Excel 97 recognizes that the workbook is
a Microsoft Excel workbook but does not recognize the exact format of the
workbook; therefore, Microsoft Excel incorrectly concludes that the
workbook is saved in a workbook format for a later version and displays the
error message in this article.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If this problem occurs, the workbook you are attempting to open is likely
corrupted. For additional information about recovering information from
damaged and corrupted workbooks, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q142117.htm">Q142117</A></B>
   TITLE     : Excel: Summary of Methods to Recover Data from Corrupted
               Files

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q147216.htm">Q147216</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL: Linking to Data in a Damaged File (5.0 and Later)

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q75818.htm">Q75818</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL: Linking to Data in a Damaged File (4.0 and Earlier)

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 97 is designed to allow you to use converters to open files
that are saved in formats that are not normally recognized by Microsoft
Excel 97. If you attempt to open a workbook with a format that is not
recognized by Microsoft Excel 97, the program assumes that the workbook is
saved in a newer format. Consequently, Microsoft Excel recommends that you
download the converter for that format from the Microsoft Web site.
<P>
Because Microsoft Excel 97 is the newest version available, a later
converter does not exist on Microsoft Web site. When a converter becomes
available, information will be added to the Web page.
<P>
Until a new version of Microsoft Excel becomes available, you receive the
error message in this article only if the workbook you are opening is
corrupted or damaged in some way.
