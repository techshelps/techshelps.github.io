<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel has a DAYS360 function, which is designed to calculate the
number of days between two specified dates based on a 360-day year, instead
of the normal 365-day year.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
DAYS360 is based on twelve 30-day months and treats each month as such.
This is useful to help compute payments if your accounting system is based
on twelve 30-day months. So, when DAYS360 calculates the number of days
between 2/28/91 and 3/1/91 as 3, this is correct. DAYS360 assumes that
February has 30 days, not 28 (or 29 in a leap year). Likewise, DAYS360
treats the dates "1/30/91" and "1/31/91" identically. "1/31/91" is
converted to "1/30/91".
<P>
DAYS360 does conform to the standards established by the NASD
(National Association of Security Dealers), and the SIA standards
which specify that:

<UL><LI>if the start date is the 31st of a month, it is equal to the 30th
   of the same month

<LI>if the end date is the 31st of a month, it is equal to the 1st of
   the next month
<P>
</UL>except when the start date is the 30th of a month.
<P>
The European method of this function is more simple. The 31st of a
month is always equal to the 30th of the same month.
<P>
DAYS360 calculates as designed and as described in the "Function
Reference".
