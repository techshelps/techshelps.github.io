<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, no "Center Across Columns" button appears on the
Formatting toolbar. In its place, a "Merge and Center" toolbar button
appears.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Although the "Center Across Columns" toolbar button is no longer available,
you can still center text across columns without merging cells. To do this,
use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the range of cells over which you want to center text.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Cells.

<P><LI>Click the Alignment tab.

<P><LI>In the Horizontal list box, click "Center Across Selection."

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The "Merge and Center" toolbar button in Microsoft Excel 97 provides a
level of functionality that is very similar to the functionality provided
by the "Center Across Columns" toolbar button in earlier versions of
Microsoft Excel. Basically, the button allows you to center information
contained in a single cell across a range of cells.
<P>
Note that there are some minor differences in behavior between the two
buttons. The following examples illustrate these differences.
<P>
<P><h3>Examples</h3>
 
<P>
Assume that you have a new worksheet in Microsoft Excel that contains the
following information:
<P>
<PRE>   A1: test
   A2: hello

</PRE></OL>In Microsoft Excel version 5.0 or 7.0, if you select the range A1:E1 and
click the "Center Across Columns" toolbar button, the word "test" appears
centered across the range A1:E1, and the gridlines between the cells
disappear. However, the range still consists of five individual cells.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you select the range A1:E1 and click the "Merge
and Center" toolbar button, the range A1:E1 is merged into a single cell.
The word "test" appears centered within this cell.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0 or 7.0, if you select the range A1:E2 and
click the "Center Across Columns" toolbar button, the word "test" appears
centered across the range A1:E1, and the word "hello" appears centered
across the range A2:E2. The gridlines between cells in these two smaller
ranges disappears. The range still consists of ten individual cells.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you select the range A1:E2 and click the "Merge
and Center" toolbar button, the entire range A1:E2 is merged into a single
cell. The word "test" appears centered within this cell. In addition,
because merging cells removes the contents of all cells within the range
except for the upper leftmost cell, you will receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   The selection contains multiple data values. Merging into one cell
   will keep the upper-left most data only.

</PRE>Clicking OK results in the deletion of the word "hello," and the merging of
the cells. Clicking Cancel cancels the merge and center process.
<P>
If the other cells in the range must retain their own contents, or if you
need to center multiple rows of information, use the workaround shown above
to format the cells with the "Center Across Selection" alignment.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>

For more information about merging cells, click the Index tab in Microsoft
Excel Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   merging, cells

</PRE>and then double-click the selected text to go to the appropriate help
topic.
