<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information discusses the use of Apple File Exchange
software to convert Microsoft Excel files from Windows to Macintosh
and vice versa with any Apple Macintosh equipped with an FDHD (floppy
disk high density) drive. These drives come standard on Apple
Macintosh computers released after the SE/30, Mac IIc, and Mac IIcx.
This includes the Mac IIsi, Mac IIci, Mac IIfx, Mac LC, Mac Quadra
700, Mac Quadra 900, Mac IIvx, Mac Centris 610, Mac Centris 650,
Quadra 800, Quadra 950, Mac LC II, Mac LC III, Performa 200, Performa
400, Performa 405, Performa 430, Performa 450, Performa 600, Powerbook
140, Powerbook 145, Powerbook 160, Powerbook 165c, Powerbook 170,
Powerbook 180, Powerbook Duo 210, Powerbook Duo 230.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Apple's high-density drives can read MS-DOS and OS/2 disks in 720K and
1.44M formats, as well as 800K PRODOS and Apple's 400K, 800K, and
1.44M formats. Using the Apple File Exchange program (which is
supplied with all Apple operating systems), it is possible for an
Apple 3.5 inch drive to read and write to MS-DOS diskettes and
translate Microsoft Excel files to and from them.
<P>
NOTE: Apple File Exchange can be found on the Utilities 2 disk of
System 6 software, or the Tidbits disk of System 7 software.
<P>
<P><h3>Transferring Files later than Excel version 1.5 Across Either Platform</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Save the file in Normal format to a 3.5 inch disk (or to the
   hard drive on a Macintosh).

<P><LI>From the Macintosh, launch Apple File Exchange.

<P><LI>Insert the MS-DOS disk into the floppy drive.

<P><LI>Select the document(s) to be translated from the source dialog
   box.

<P><LI>Select the appropriate drive and folder level for the destination
   dialog box.

<P><LI>Choose "default translation" from the "MS-DOS to Mac" menu, if
   going from Windows to Macintosh, or the "Mac to MS-DOS" menu if
   going from Mac to Windows.

<P><LI>Click the Translate button.

<P><LI>Quit Apple File Exchange.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Files traveling from Macintosh to Windows will have their names
truncated to adhere to MS-DOS limitations. This may cause name
conflicts. If this situation occurs, Apple File Exchange will allow
you to edit the file names before translation. For easiest
translation, insure that the first eleven characters of each Macintosh
file name are unique.
<P>
All versions of Microsoft Excel after 1.5 can read files translated
from another platform according to the same limitations governing all
versions of the program, that is, later versions of the application
can read files from earlier versions, but not vice versa. In order to
read a Microsoft Excel for Windows version 3.0 file in Microsoft Excel
for the Macintosh version 2.2, for example, that file should be saved
in Microsoft Excel 2.1 file format in Windows before translation
through Apple File Exchange.
<P>
<P><h3>Transferring Excel version 1.5 and Earlier Across Either Platform</h3>
 
<P>
Follow the steps above except:

<OL><P><LI>Save the file in SYLK format before translation.

<P><LI>Choose "text translation" from either the "MS-DOS to Mac" or "Mac
   to MS-DOS" menus.
