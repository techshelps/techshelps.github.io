<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you print a worksheet in Microsoft Excel 97 that has comments, and
select the As Displayed On Sheet option in the Comments box of the Page
Setup dialog box, the comments may not be printed as expected. This problem
may occur if comments are placed on or near a page break.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior will vary, depending on the active printer driver, and is
expected behavior. Comments in Microsoft Excel 97 are drawing objects, just
like rectangles and text boxes. You may see similar problems with other
drawing objects placed on or near a page break.
<P>
Use the following information for the following examples:

<OL><P><LI>Type the following information into a worksheet:
<P>
<PRE>       A1:  100     B1:  100     C1:  100     D1:  100     E1:
       A2:  200     B2:  200     C2:  200     D2:  200     E2:
       A3:  300     B3:  300     C3:  300     D3:  300     E3:
       A4:  400     B4:  400     C4:  400     D4:  400     E4:
       A5:  500     B5:  500     C5:  500     D5:  500     E5:

</PRE><P><LI>Select cell E1.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Page Break.

<P><LI>Using the right mouse button (right-click), click cell D1, and click
    Insert Comment on the shortcut menu. Type "This is a test" (without
    the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Right-click cell D1 and click Show Comment.

<P><LI>Right-click cell D4 and click Insert Comment on the shortcut menu. Type
    "This is a test" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Right-click cell D4 and click Show Comment.

<P><LI>With the comment selected, move it to cell D6 and position it so that
    half is over column D and half is over column E.

<P><LI>Right-click cell B4 and click Insert Comment on the shortcut menu. Type
    "This is a test" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Right-click cell B4 and click Show Comment.

<P><LI>With the comment selected, move it to cell D10 and position it so that
    one-fourth is over column D and three-fourths is over column E.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Page Setup.

<P><LI>Select the Sheet tab.

<P><LI>In the Comments box, select As Displayed On Sheet, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Example 1</h3>
 
<P>
The comment entered in cell D4 is to the immediate left of the vertical
page break. Notice that the comment is displayed to the immediate right of
the vertical page break. When viewed in Print Preview, this comment will be
printed on page two of the printout, rather than on page one where the
actual cell is printed. When set to print as displayed, comments, just as
objects, will print where they are placed, which is not necessarily on the
same page as the cell contents. For example, the comment at cell D4 can be
moved to page three, and it will then print on page three. If the comment
needs to be printed on page one, you have the option of manually moving it
to page one.
<P>
<P><h3>Example 2</h3>
 
<P>
The comment for cell D6 prints all on page one, even though it crosses over
the page break on screen. This is due to a by-design feature of Microsoft
Excel 97 where the page-break boundaries are different, in some cases, for
objects than for text, because objects do not have to be tied to column
widths. For the text in this example, the page break then occurs after
column D (as displayed by the dashed line on screen), and in preview, there
is a lot of blank space to the right of column D. But those objects,
including comments, that cross a page break get to use the "blank space"
between the last column that fits on a page and the right margin, and
therefore, if the Print As Displayed option is enabled, the comment will
print on page one because it, itself, will fit. It was decided that it was
better to print the objects if they would fit, even if the underlying text
wouldn't. Another complicating factor is that the objects and fonts
displayed at the ~72 dpi screen resolution do not always map correctly to
the typically much higher printer resolution, which in addition to the
factor above, can cause the two halves of an object on a page break to not
match exactly when printed. This is also the reason why the comment for
cell B4 will print on page two instead of page one like the comment in D6.
