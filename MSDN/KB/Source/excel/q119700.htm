The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Query for Windows, version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Query for Windows 95, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Query does not include a feature to automatically undelete
records from or pack a dBASE file. However, you can use Microsoft Query and
the ODBC driver settings to accomplish these tasks.
<P>
NOTE: Undeleting a record in a dBASE file is the process of removing the
deletion mark from a record in the database file. Packing a dBASE file is
the process of removing records from the file that have been marked for
deletion.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
Each of the following procedures require that you save a new copy of the
original dBASE file. There is no way to undelete or pack the original dBASE
file from within Microsoft Query.
<P>
Note that this is the recommended procedure for many dBASE-compatible
products. This process ensures that your original data stays intact while
you perform the operation. If you attempt to perform this process by
overwriting the original file, data loss could result if the procedure is
unsuccessful for any reason. Microsoft Query DOES NOT allow you to
overwrite a file that is currently open.
<P>
<P><h3>To Undelete Records</h3>
 
<P>
The following process will undelete ALL records that have been marked
for deletion. There is no way to undelete individual records.

<OL><P><LI>Ensure that Microsoft Query is not running. This can be
   accomplished by invoking the Task Manager by pressing the CTRL+ESC
   key combination.

<P><LI>From Windows Control Panel, double-click the ODBC icon.
   Select a dBASE data source listing. Click the Options button. Turn
   on the Show Deleted Records option. Close Windows Control Panel.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Query, and open the dBASE file in a new or saved query.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save As. Select a dBASE data source
   listing and enter a unique filename. Click the OK button.
<P>
</OL>This procedure will save a new version of the dBASE file containing all the
records that were displayed in step 2 above, and none of these records will
be marked for deletion. You can now delete or rename the original dBASE
file and name the new file with the name of your original file.
<P>
<P><h3>To Pack a dBASE File</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Ensure that Microsoft Query is not running. This can be
   accomplished by invoking the Task Manager by pressing the CTRL+ESC
   key combination.

<P><LI>From the Windows Control Panel, double-click the ODBC icon.
   Select a dBASE data source listing. Click the Options button. Turn
   off the Show Deleted Records option. Close the Windows Control
   Panel.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Query. Open the dBASE file in a new or saved query.

<P><LI>Choose Save As from the File menu. Select a dBASE data source
   listing and enter a unique filename. Click the OK button.
<P>
</OL>You have now saved a new version of the dBASE file that does not include
any records that were marked for deletion in the original file. It is now
possible to delete or rename the original dBASE file and rename the new
file to the name of the original using MS-DOS commands or Windows File
Manager.
