The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you open a Microsoft Excel version 4.0 workbook
file that contains an unbound document file, you may receive the following
error messages:
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel 97</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;worksheet name&gt; could not be found. Check the spelling of the file
   name and verify that the file location is correct.

   If you are trying to open the file from your list of most recently
   used files on the File menu, make sure that the file has not been
   renamed, moved, or deleted.

</PRE>followed by the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot load an empty Microsoft Excel 4.0 Workbook

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Filename is not valid

</PRE>followed by the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot load an empty Microsoft Excel 4.0 Workbook

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if the unbound document file is located on a network
drive, and you do not currently have access to that network drive. In
Microsoft Excel, you cannot open a Microsoft Excel version 4.0 workbook
file that does not contain any worksheets. Because of this, if the only
worksheet in a Microsoft Excel version 4.0 workbook is unavailable, you
cannot open the workbook file in Microsoft Excel versions later than
version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To open a Microsoft Excel version 4.0 workbook that contains an unbound
worksheet that is located on a network drive, do either of the
following:

<UL><LI>Connect to the network drive that contains the workbook file with
   the unbound document.
<P>
 -or-

<LI>Open the file in Microsoft Excel version 4.0. You still receive the
   error message "Filename is not valid"; however, the workbook file
   opens and you can view the path to the worksheet in the Workbook
   Contents window. Once you know the network path to the file, you can
   connect to the network drive again and open the unbound worksheet.
