The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you receive a series of alerts stating "Cannot find &lt;filename&gt;"
when starting Microsoft Excel 4.0, Microsoft Excel is unable to
locate add-in macros installed with the application. If the add-ins
have been moved or deleted from the folder in which they were
originally installed, this error message is generated.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
During the installation of Microsoft Excel 4.0, the path to each
installed add-in is written as a text string into the Microsoft Excel
Settings (4) file, which is stored in the System Folder (under System
7, the settings file is in the Preferences Folder inside the System
Folder). The location of the Microsoft Excel application is also
written to the settings file.
<P>
When Microsoft Excel is launched, it looks for all of the add-ins
listed in the settings file and attempts to launch those add-ins.
Microsoft Excel looks for these add-ins inside the Macro Library
folder. If the Macro Library folder is not in the same folder as the
Microsoft Excel application, Microsoft Excel looks for it in the
folder where Microsoft Excel was originally installed. If Microsoft
Excel cannot locate the add-in within the Macro Library folder or if
the Macro Library folder itself cannot be found, the error message is
returned for each add-in that it cannot locate.
<P>
If the Macro Library folder was renamed or moved, rename the folder
Macro Library or move it back to the location where it was installed.
If an add-in has been removed, use the Add-in Manager to remove the
add-in from the startup list.
<P>
To remove an add-in from the startup list:

<OL><P><LI>From the Options menu, choose Add-ins.

<P><LI>Click the appropriate Add-in name.

<P><LI>Click the Remove button.
<P>
</OL>To edit the path information for an installed Add-in:

<OL><P><LI>From the Options menu, choose Add-ins.

<P><LI>Click the appropriate Add-in name.

<P><LI>Click the Edit button.

<P><LI>Edit the path information to correctly point to the Add-in file.
