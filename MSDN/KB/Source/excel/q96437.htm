<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To calculate the balance of a loan for any period during the life of
the loan, use the IPMT function to calculate the interest payment for the 
next period and divide it by the interest rate of the loan.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For example, to find the balance of a $65,000 loan after 36 payments (3 
years), when the rate of the loan is 9.5 percent per year, and payments are 
made monthly over a period of 30 years, calculate the IPMT of the loan for 
the next payment period and divide it by the computed interest rate, as in 
the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   =IPMT(9.5%/12,37,30*12,-65000,,0)/(9.5%/12)

</PRE>Note that 9.5%/12 is the interest rate per period, 37 is the period for
which you want to know your balance, 30*12 is total number of payment
periods, and -65,000 is the present balance of the loan.
<P>
This formula returns the value of $63,674.26. (You can check this value 
against the Amortize spreadsheet located in the EXAMPLES subdirectory of 
your Excel directory, for Microsoft Excel for Windows, or the Examples 
folder for Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh.)
<P>
In the function above, 12 refers to the number of payments in a year.
For a loan that is compounded yearly, you would calculate the loan
balance at the end of the third year with the following formula:
<P>
<PRE>   =IPMT(9.5%,4,30,-65000,,0)/9.5%

</PRE>This formula returns a value of $63,569.61. In this example, there
is no need to divide the rate, and multiply the years by 12, because
the number of payments per year is 1.
