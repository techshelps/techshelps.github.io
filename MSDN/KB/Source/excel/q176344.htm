The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you apply the Shrink To Fit alignment format to a cell in a worksheet
in the versions of Microsoft Excel that are listed at the beginning of this
article, either of the following problems may occur:

<UL><LI>The text completely disappears from the cell.

<LI>The text increases in size and is cut off by the border of the cell.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The cell contains a large amount of text (for example, 60 or more
   characters).
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The cell is not wide enough to display all of the text you want to
   shrink.
<P>
</UL>Specifically, the first problem occurs because Microsoft Excel cannot
display text you resized with the Shrink To Fit format when the text is too
small. The second problem occurs only in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh
Edition because of a screen redraw problem in the program.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around these problems, increase the column width of the cell or
reduce the amount of text in the cell.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article,
use the Shrink To Fit format to automatically scale text in a cell so that
it fits within the cell. As you increase or decrease the amount of text in
the cell, or as you adjust the width of the cell, Microsoft Excel
automatically resizes the text to fit within the cell.
<P>
When Microsoft Excel resizes text that uses the Shrink To Fit format, it
must resize the text to a whole-number point size. If the point size is too
small (for example, 1 or 2 points), the text may disappear from the cell.
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, the text may grow in size and be
truncated by the border of the cell.
