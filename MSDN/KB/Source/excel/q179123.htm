The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, if you activate a text box on a
worksheet and drag a text clipping into the active text box, no text is
placed in the text box.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Drag the text clipping from the desktop onto a cell.

<P><LI>Click in the formula bar to activate it.

<P><LI>Select text in the formula bar and click Copy on the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Close the formula bar by pressing the ESC key or by clicking the red
   "X."

<P><LI>Click the text box to select it and click Paste on the Edit menu to
   paste the text.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, if you drag a text clipping to a
cell while you are in edit mode, the text clipping appears on the desktop
instead of in the cell. This behavior indicates that the action is not
valid. However, this behavior does not occur when you drag a text clipping
to an active text box. When you do this, nothing happens.
<P>
When you drag a text clipping to Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, it
is entered into the active cell as text; it is not inserted as an embedded
object. If you drag a text clipping onto a cell that is not active, the
cell is activated and the clipping is entered into the cell. If you drag a
text clipping on top of a text box that is not activate, a cell under the
text box may be selected, and the text clipping is entered as text in that
cell. Note that the cell may be hidden from view by the text box.
<P>
You can create a text clipping by dragging highlighted text from a
Microsoft Word 98 for the Macintosh document onto the desktop. Each text
clipping that is created (after the first one is created) is named with a
name is similar to the following
<P>
<PRE>   Text clipping &lt;number&gt;

</PRE></OL>where &lt;number&gt; is a number.
<P>
If you drag a cell in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition onto the
desktop, a picture clipping is copied to the desktop. You can drag a
picture clipping on top of an active text box in Microsoft Excel 98
Macintosh Edition, but text that appears as a picture is placed on top of
the text box instead of in it.
<P>
When you drag a text clipping into an active text box in Microsoft Word 98
Macintosh Edition or in Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh Edition, the text
clipping is entered in that text box.
