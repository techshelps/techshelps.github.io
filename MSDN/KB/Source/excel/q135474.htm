<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Microsoft Excel, the working folder (or the folder to which
new files are saved by default) is the My Documents folder located on the
drive to which you installed Microsoft Excel or Office.
<P>
Although you can change this default location by entering a new folder in
the Default File Location box on the General tab in the Options dialog box,
you cannot start Microsoft Excel with another working folder by using the
Start In box in a shortcut for Microsoft Excel.
<P>
The following information describes how you can start Microsoft Excel with
a working folder other than My Documents or the value set in the Default
File Locations box.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To start Microsoft Excel with a different working folder, you can use the
/p startup switch in the Target box in a shortcut for Microsoft Excel. This
allows you to start with a different working folder depending on the
shortcut you use to start Microsoft Excel. To set a different working
folder for a shortcut for Microsoft Excel, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Click the right mouse button on the shortcut you want to use to start
   Microsoft Excel with a different working folder. Note that the
   shortcut can be located on the desktop, in any folder, or on the
   Office Shortcut Bar.

<P><LI>Click the Shortcut tab.

<P><LI>Add the following to the end of the command line that appears in the
   Target box
<P>
<P><PRE>      /p "&lt;folder&gt;"
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;folder&gt; is the folder that you want to be the working folder
   when you start Microsoft Excel from this shortcut.
<P>
   For example, to start Microsoft Excel with the working folder "c:\My
   Files", add the following to the end of the command line that appears
   in the Target box:
<P>
<P><PRE>      /p "C:\My Files"
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>When you double-click the shortcut to start Microsoft Excel, the working
folder is now the folder that you specified using the startup switch in the
shortcut. Note that this procedure does not change the value that appears
in the Default File Location box in Microsoft Excel. Additionally, if you
delete the folder that appears in the Default File Location box in the
Options dialog box in Microsoft Excel, the default value (the My Documents
folder) appears again in this box when you close and then restart Microsoft
Excel. This procedure works in Windows 95, Windows NT 3.51, and Windows NT
4.0.
<P>
