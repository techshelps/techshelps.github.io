<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information details how to use R1C1 references as text
in the SELECT() statement:
<P>
<P><h3>R1C1 Style References</h3>
 
<P>
Cell references passed as arguments to the SELECT() statement can be
parsed to actual references at either macro creation time or macro run
time. To hold a cell reference in its unparsed state, it must be
surrounded by double quotation marks. This type of reference can be
used when the macro sheet is in either A1 or R1C1 notation. For an
example of R1C1 as a cell reference, query on the following words:
<P>
<PRE>   R1C1 and reference and relative

</PRE><h3>"R1C1"</h3>
 
<P>
This is an absolute reference to the active cell on the active
worksheet. Using the pair of quotation marks ("") in place of the
exclamation mark (!) prevents this reference from being parsed until
macro run time. This type of cell reference operates in the same
manner as !R1C1 does as a cell reference.
<P>
<P><h3>"R[#]C[#]"</h3>
 
<P>
This is a relative reference to a cell on the active sheet; it is not
similar to the !R[#]C[#] reference type, which is described in a
separate article that can be found by querying on the following words:
<P>
<PRE>   R1C1 and reference and relative

</PRE>Using the pair of double quotation marks ("") in place of the
exclamation mark (!) prevents this reference from being parsed until
macro run time. The following macro will select the cell at row 3,
column 3 on the sheet named "Example" (without quotation marks):
<P>
<PRE>   =ACTIVATE("example")
   =SELECT("R1C1")
   =SELECT("R[2]C[2]")
   =RETURN()

</PRE>The above form is usually appropriate to use when specifying a cell
relative to the active cell.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This information was taken from the "Macro Tips" chapter in the
"Microsoft Excel Technical Reference for the Macintosh" (pages
148-149). Please note that for most applications, using the OFFSET()
statement will provide greater flexibility as well as increased speed,
since parsing a text-style reference to an actual reference takes
additional time each time the statement is encountered. Also note that
the SELECT() statement is one of very few functions that will accept a
text-style R1C1 reference. For more information on OFFSET(), query on
the following keywords:
<P>
<PRE>   offset and relative and reference
