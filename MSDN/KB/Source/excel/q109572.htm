The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you receive a general protection (GP) fault when
you open a worksheet that has been saved in the Microsoft Excel 3.0
Worksheet or 4.0 Worksheet format if the worksheet contains a cell
that refers to a named 3-D range on another workbook and follows a
cell that refers to a cell that is included in that named 3-D range.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do any of the following:

<UL><LI>If you have already saved a worksheet in the situation described above,
   open the file in Microsoft Word, or another application that can open
   Microsoft Excel 3.0 and 4.0 worksheets. Save the file in a text format
   and open the file in Microsoft Excel. Formatting and defined names may
   be lost, but you can recover your text with this method.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Enter the reference to the named 3-D range in a cell above or to the
   left of the cell that refers to the cell contained in the 3-D range.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Avoid referring to named 3-D ranges and cells contained in that range
   when saving a worksheet in Microsoft Excel 3.0 Worksheet or 4.0
   Worksheet format. You can reference one or the other but not both.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A 3-D reference is one that spans two or more sheets in a workbook.
For example, to sum the range A1:B2 on Sheet1 and Sheet2 in a
workbook, use the following formula:
<P>
<PRE>   =SUM(Sheet1:Sheet2!$A$1:$B$2)

</PRE>If you save a worksheet that contains 3-D a reference to the workbook
containing it in Microsoft Excel 3.0 or 4.0 Worksheet format, you receive
the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot write record.

   Continue reporting each error?

</PRE>followed by:
