The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you import a spreadsheet that was created in Enable,
date values in the imported sheet may differ from the original sheet by one
day.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Cells that are formatted in Enable as dates and contain a date values later
than February 28, 1900, will be imported to Microsoft Excel with the date
one day early. For example, March 30, 1990, is imported as March 29, 1990.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, you can create a Visual Basic procedure that
finds any date later than February 28, 1900, and adds one day to it.
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,

<P>
The following Visual Basic procedure finds all cells containing a date
later than February 28, 1900, and adds one day to it. To create an run this
macro, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In a new Visual Basic module, enter the following code:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub AddADay()
      'loops through each cell in selected range
      For Each Cell In Selection
        'Checks to see if cell contains a date
        If IsDate(Cell.Value) = True Then
         ' check to see if the serial number is
         ' greater than 59 (the serial number for
         ' 2/28/1900
            If Cell.Formula &gt; 59 Then
                'Adds 1 day to the existing date
                Cell.Formula = Cell.Formula + 1
            End If
         End If
      Next
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Select any range in the spreadsheet.

<P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Macro.

<P><LI>In the Macro dialog box, select AddADay, and then choose Run.
