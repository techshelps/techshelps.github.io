The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a workbook in Microsoft Excel 97, it may take a long time to
save the workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if either of the following conditions is true:

<UL><LI>You click Save AS on the File menu, click Options, and then type
   a password in the Password To Open box.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You protect the workbook with a password by clicking the Tools
   menu, pointing to Protection, and clicking Protect Workbook.
<P>
</UL>For example, a workbook without a password that takes three seconds to save
may take over two minutes to save when you apply a password or when you
protect the workbook with a password.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows, Service Release 1 saves a file
containing a password approximately 50% faster than the original release of
Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
This problem occurs because of the way that Microsoft Excel 97 applies
encryption to a workbook when you apply a Password To Open password or when
you protect the workbook with a password.
<P>
NOTE: Applying a Password To Modify password to the workbook does not cause
this problem to occur.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Excel
97 for Windows. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Excel 97 for
Windows, Service Release 1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, you can apply a password to a workbook by doing
the following:

<OL><P><LI>Open or switch to the workbook.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As, and then click Options.

<P><LI>In the Save Options dialog box, specify a password in the Password To
   Open and/or the Password To Modify box. Then, click OK.

<P><LI>Confirm each password by reentering it and clicking OK.

<P><LI>Click Save to save the workbook with the password(s).
<P>
</OL>If you apply a Password To Open password to a workbook, you cannot open the
workbook without providing the password. If you apply a Password To Modify
password to a workbook, you cannot save changes to the workbook without
providing the password. If you do not know the password, you can still save
the workbook by using a different file name.
<P>
To protect a workbook in Microsoft Excel 97 do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Open or switch to the workbook.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Protection, and then click Protect Workbook.

<P><LI>If you want, type a password in the Password box and click OK. If
   you are prompted, reenter the password and click OK again.
<P>
</OL>Protecting a workbook in this way does not prevent other users from opening
the workbook or from saving it with its original file name. However, it
does prevent other users from changing the structure of the workbook or
from moving its window on the screen unless they know the password.
