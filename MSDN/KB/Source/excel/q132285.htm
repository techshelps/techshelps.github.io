The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you double-click an embedded object on a worksheet
that you have stopped sharing, you may receive an illegal operation error
message. When you click Details, a message similar to the following
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE
   at 0137:501165fe

   -or-

   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE
   at 0137:500e8ba8

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you perform each of the following actions without
closing the workbook between actions:

<UL><LI>Insert an OLE object on your worksheet

<LI>Share the workbook that contains the object

<LI>Stop sharing the workbook

<LI>Double-click the embedded object
<P>
</UL>The problem only occurs when you stop sharing a workbook, and then double-
click an embedded object if the embedded object was inserted in the
workbook since the last time you opened the file.
<P>
Note that you cannot edit or insert an object in a shared workbook. You
must stop sharing the workbook before you can edit or insert an embedded
object. However, if you have not closed the workbook since you inserted the
object, you receive an illegal operation error message if you stop sharing
the workbook, and then double-click the object.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem when you share a workbook that contains an
embedded object, and then want to edit the object, use any of the following
methods:
<P>
Method 1: Close the workbook, and open the workbook again before you clear
<PRE>          the Allow Multi-User Editing check box in the Shared Lists dialog
          box.

</PRE>Method 2: Clear the Allow Multi-User Editing check box in the Shared Lists
<PRE>          dialog box, close the workbook, and then open the workbook again
          before you edit the object.

</PRE>Method 3: Use the Open or Edit command to edit the object instead of
<PRE>          double-clicking the object by doing the following:

          a. Clear the Allow Multi-User Editing check box in the Shared
             Lists dialog box.

          b. Click the embedded object one time.

          c. On the Edit menu, click &lt;type&gt; Object (where &lt;type&gt; is the
             object type, such as Document) and then click Open or Edit.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
