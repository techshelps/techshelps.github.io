<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 1.x, 2.2, 3.x, 4.x, 5.0

<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A circular reference exists when formulas refer to and are dependent on
each other. For example, if cell A1 contains the formula "=B1" and cell B1
contains the formula "=A1", a circular reference has been created because
both formulas depend on each other for their answer.
<P>
If you create a circular reference in Microsoft Excel, you receive the
error message "Can't Resolve Circular References" when you enter the
formula. The status bar then displays the following message where
"cell_ref" is part of the circular reference:
<P>
<PRE>   Circular: cell_ref

</PRE>If you have more than one worksheet open in Microsoft Excel and the status
bar displays only "Circular" (without quotation marks), then one of the
other open worksheets has a circular reference. You need to activate each
worksheet in turn until the status bar displays the "Circular: cell_ref"
message.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To find all cells involved in the circular reference, do the following:
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel Version 5.0 and later</h3>
 
<P>
Menu Method

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell whose cell reference is displayed in the status bar.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Go To, and then choose the Special button.

<P><LI>Select the Precedents option, and then select the All Levels option.
   Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>All cells for this circular reference are highlighted on the worksheet.
Continue this procedure until all circular references have been found.
<P>
Toolbar Method

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell whose cell reference is displayed in the status bar.

<P><LI>From View menu, choose Toolbars.

<P><LI>From the Toolbars list, select the Auditing check box, and choose OK.

<P><LI>From the Auditing Toolbar, choose the Trace Precedents button. Click the
   Trace Precedents button until the system beeps, indicating that there
   are no more precedents.
<P>
</OL>Each time you click the Trace Precedents button, an arrow is drawn to an
additional level of precedence.
<P>
Visual Basic Method

<OL><P><LI>In a new module, enter the following:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Example()
         ActiveSheet.CircularReference.Select
         ActiveCell.Precedents.Select
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Select the sheet tab of the worksheet that contains the circular
   reference, and run the Example macro.
<P>
</OL>All cells for this circular reference are highlighted on the worksheet.

logical line or you can divide the lines of code and include the line
continuation character. For more information about Visual Basic for

<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel Versions 4.0 and Earlier</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select the cell whose cell reference is displayed in the status bar.

<P><LI>From the Formula menu, choose Select Special.

<P><LI>Select the Precedents option, and then select the All Levels option.
   Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>All cells for this circular reference are highlighted on the worksheet.
Continue this procedure until all circular references have been found.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel 1.5 and Earlier</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 1.5 and earlier, the error message "Can't
Resolve Circular References" will be displayed if formulas refer to each
other in a circular manner.
<P>
To find all cells involved in the circular reference, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the Options menu, choose Calculation.

<P><LI>Select Manual.

<P><LI>Select Iteration.

<P><LI>Enter at least 100 (default) in the Maximum Iterations box.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the Options menu, choose Calculate Now or press COMMAND+= on
   the keyboard.

<P><LI>Look at the screen for any numbers that are changing rapidly or
   "flashing." These cells contain circular references and Microsoft
   Excel is performing iterative calculations on these formulas,
   changing the cell value with each iteration.

<P><LI>If this is a large worksheet, scroll to view another portion of the
   sheet and repeat steps 6 and 7. Continue checking each portion of
   the worksheet until all circular references are found.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the status bar is displayed in Microsoft Excel versions 5.0,
4.0, 3.0 and 2.2. To display the status bar at the bottom of the screen in
Microsoft Excel version 5.0, choose Status Bar from the View menu. In
Microsoft Excel versions 4.0 and earlier, choose Workspace from the Options
menu, select the Status Bar check box, and choose OK.
