WARNING: The information in this article has not been confirmed or tested
by Microsoft. Some or all of the information in this article has been
taken from unconfirmed customer reports. ANY USE BY YOU OF THE INFORMATION
PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this
information "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or

<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit includes a collection of templates
that you can use with the System Policy Editor to specify user policies for
the Office programs. However, only the Microsoft Word and Microsoft
PowerPoint templates provide a specific setting for implementing macro
virus protection through policies.
<P>
Because this setting is not stored in a separate registry key for Microsoft
Excel, the method for implementing this policy is apparent only when you
view the Microsoft Excel policy template. This article describes the
changes that are required to implement macro virus protection with system
policies.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can edit the registry using System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) or
Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Check with your network administrator before
you make any changes to the registry.
<P>
System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) is available in the Microsoft Office 97
Resource Kit.
<P>
It is assumed that you installed the System Policy Editor and correctly
added the Microsoft Office System Policy template that is available in the
Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit (the template is Off97wnt.adm for
Microsoft Windows NT clients or Off97w95.adm for Windows 95 clients).
<P>
NOTE: System Policy Editor is not included in the floppy disk version of
Windows 95. You can download Policy.exe, a self-extracting executable file
containing Poledit.exe, from online services. Please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for information about downloading
Policy.exe:

   TITLE     : CD-ROM Extras for Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade

</PRE>To implement Macro Virus Protection using system policies, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Start the System Policy Editor.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click New Policy.

<P><LI>Double-click the Default User icon.

<P><LI>In the Default User Properties dialog box, click the plus sign next to
   "Excel 97," click the plus sign next to Tools_Options, and then click
   the plus sign next to next to BitFields.

<P><LI>Click the "Options6 value" check box and type 8 in the "Options6 value"
   box.
<P>
   By setting this value to 8, you also set the policies for all other
   items in the Option6 bitfield. These items are listed in the following
   table.
<P>
<PRE>      Item     Function
      ------------------------------------------------------

      bit 0    Show Name part of Chart Tips
      bit 1    Show Value part of Chart Tips
      bit 2    Intellimouse Roll action: 0 = scroll, 1= zoom
      bit 3    Macro Virus Protection
      bit 4-15 (Reserved)

   When you set the Options6 value to 8, you set the value for bit 3 to 1
   and you set all other bit values to 0. There is no way to prevent this
   behavior from occurring.

</PRE><P><LI>Make any other changes, and then save the .pol file.
<P></OL>
