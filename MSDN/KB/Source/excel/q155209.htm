The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when you open a workbook that was created in
Microsoft Excel version 5.0 or 7.0, you may experience the following two
problems:

<UL><LI>You get a worksheet, titled "Sheet1" (without quotation marks),
   inserted into the workbook.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You cannot delete or hide "Sheet1" from the workbook unless you
   insert another visible sheet first.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience the aforementioned problems if the workbook you created
in Microsoft Excel version 5.0 or 7.0 was a workbook containing one or more
module sheets and no other sheets.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You will not initially be able to delete or hide the worksheet that is
inserted into your workbook when you open your workbook in Microsoft Excel
97. You must always have one or more visible sheets in a workbook, and in
Microsoft Excel 97, there is no way to unhide module sheets that were
inserted in previous versions of Microsoft Excel. If you insert another
visible sheet, you can delete or hide the "Sheet1" sheet.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you encounter the aforementioned behavior, and you try to delete the
inserted Sheet1, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   A workbook must contain at least one visible worksheet.

   To hide, delete, or move the selected sheet(s), you must first insert
   a new sheet or unhide a sheet that is already hidden.

</PRE>In Microsoft Excel 97, you cannot insert new module sheets or unhide module
sheets that were inserted into a workbook that was created in earlier
versions of Microsoft Excel. Therefore, you must retain this extra
worksheet that is inserted into your workbook. If you insert another
visible sheet into the workbook (such as a chart sheet or a Microsoft Excel
5.0 dialog sheet), you can then delete or hide the "Sheet1" sheet that
Microsoft Excel created.
<P>

Microsoft Excel, click the Index tab in Microsoft Excel Help, type the
