The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 File Converter Setup program, you
may receive the following error messages even if Microsoft Excel is
installed on your computer
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find Microsoft Excel

</PRE>followed by:
<P>
<PRE>   The WK4 converter has not been installed properly

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you have renamed your Microsoft Excel executable
file, EXCEL.EXE. The Microsoft Excel executable file must be named
EXCEL.EXE for the converter to be properly installed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this behavior, make sure that your Microsoft Excel
executable file is named EXCEL.EXE before you install the Lotus 1-2-3
WK4 File Converter.
<P>
To rename this file, close Microsoft Excel, and then use the Rename
dialog box in File Manager. The Rename dialog box is available by
choosing Rename from the File Menu in File Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 File Converter Setup program, setup
searches your computer for the file EXCEL.EXE, and copies the file
XLCONVW4.DLL to the directory that contains EXCEL.EXE. The location
of this file is then written to the [Converters] section of your
EXCEL5.INI file.
<P>
For example, if your Microsoft Excel executable file is located in
d:\excel5, the [Converters] section of your EXCEL5.INI file contains
the following line after you run the Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 File Converter
Setup
<P>
<PRE>   convn=Lotus 1-2-3 Release 4 or 5 (*.wk4),D:\EXCEL5\XLCONVW4.DLL,*.wk4

</PRE>where convn indicates the number of Microsoft Excel external file
converters that are installed, for example conv2.
<P>
Note that if the Setup program does not locate the EXCEL.EXE file on
your local hard drive, Setup also searches other available drives,
such as network drives.
<P>
To open Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 files in Microsoft Excel, you must obtain the
Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 File Converter. The Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 File Converter is
available in application note WE1130 "Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 File
Converter." You can obtain WE1130 from the following sources:
