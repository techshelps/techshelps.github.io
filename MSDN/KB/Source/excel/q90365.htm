<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 3.0, 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, unattached text on a chart may not print in the same
location as displayed on the screen. This behavior may occur with labels
placed above or on the data markers (for example, labels over columns in a
column chart).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
One way to fix the location of text for printing is to make a picture image
of your chart and then print the picture. For text that is placed above the
data markers, you can add data point values to your chart then replace the
numbers with your labels.
<P>
It may also help to use the Size On Screen option rather than the Scale To
Fit Page, or Use Full Page options in the Page Setup dialog box. These
options are available when you choose Page Setup from the File menu with a
chart window as the active window.
<P>
For embedded charts, it might help to size the chart to fit on one page and
then print without scaling. That is, have the Reduce/Enlarge to option in
the Page Setup dialog box selected with a value of 100 percent.
<P>
<P><h3>To Print a Picture Image of Your Chart</h3>
 
<P>
To print a picture image, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Bring your chart up in a chart window.
<P>
   If your chart is embedded on a worksheet, double-click it to bring
   it up in a chart window.

<P><LI>From the Chart menu, choose Select Chart.

<P><LI>Hold down the SHIFT key and choose Copy Picture from the Edit menu.

<P><LI>In the Copy Picture dialog box, select the As Shown On Screen
   option for both Appearance and Size, and then choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose New.

<P><LI>In the New dialog box, select New Worksheet from the list, and then
   choose OK.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Paste.

<P><LI>Resize the chart as desired.
<P>
   NOTE: You may want disable gridline printing by clearing the Cell
   Gridlines option in the Page Setup dialog box.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Print.
<P>
</OL>IMPORTANT: The resulting image is a picture of your chart and won't be
updated when the original data changes. You need to create a new picture of
your chart if your data changes.
<P>
To Attach Labels to Data Markers (version 5.0)
 
<P>
To attach labels, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the chart in a chart window.

<P><LI>Double click the series to which you want to attach data markers.

<P><LI>Choose the Data Labels tab in the Format Data Series dialog box.

<P><LI>Select either Show Value or Show Label.

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>To Attach Labels to Data Markers (version 3.0, 4.0)
 
<P>
To attach labels, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Bring your chart up in a chart window.
<P>
   If your chart is embedded on a worksheet, double-click it to bring
   it up in a chart window.

<P><LI>From the Chart menu, choose Attach Text.

<P><LI>In the Attach Text dialog box, choose the Series And Data Point
   option.

<P><LI>In the Series Number box, type data series number you want to
   attach the label to.
<P>
   For more information on data series see pages 401-403 in "Microsoft
   Excel User's Guide 1," version 4.0.

<P><LI>In the Point Number box, type the number of the data point you want
   to add a label to.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Microsoft Excel places the value for the specified data point above
   (or next to, depending on the chart type) the data marker.

<P><LI>In the formula bar select the number and delete it, and then type in
   the label you want attached to this data marker.
<P>
   Note: You can also enter a reference to a cell on your worksheet if
   you want to have your attached labels change as information on your
   worksheet changes. To do this, type an equal sign (=) followed by
   the cell reference to the label on your worksheet. An easy way to
   enter the cell reference is to switch to your worksheet and click
   the cell that contains your label.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 1 through 8 until you have attached labels to all the
   data markers you want labeled.
