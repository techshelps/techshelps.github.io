The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, you may receive one or
more of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Not enough memory.

   -or-

   This file is not in a recognizable format.

   - If you know the file is from another program which is incompatible
     with Microsoft Excel, click Cancel, then open this file in its
     original application. If you want to open the file later in
     Microsoft Excel, save it in a format that is compatible, such as
     text format.

   - If you suspect the file is damaged, click Help for more information
     about solving the problem.

   - If you still want to see what text is contained in the file, click
     OK. Then click Finish in the Text Import Wizard.

   -or-

   File not loaded completely.

</PRE>Note that these error messages may appear more than once.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You click Preferences on the Tools menu, and then select the General
   tab.
<P>
  -and-

<LI>The folder you specify in the Alternate Startup File Location box is a
   folder that contains files that cannot be opened by Microsoft Excel 98
   Macintosh Edition, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Macintosh HD:Microsoft Office 98:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Macintosh HD:Microsoft Office 98:Office:
</PRE><P>
</UL>If you specify either of these folders in the Alternate Startup File
Location box, Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition attempts to open all of
the files in the folder, including program files. Because these files
cannot be opened by Microsoft Excel, you receive one or more of the error
messages in the "Symptoms" section in this article.
<P>
NOTE: You may need to restart your computer to stop receiving the error
messages.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>If you are unable to start Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, go to
   step 2. Otherwise, go to step 4.

<P><LI>In the Finder, double-click the icon for Microsoft Excel. Then, quickly
   hold down the SHIFT key.

<P><LI>After Microsoft Excel has started, release the SHIFT key and proceed to
   step 4.
<P>
   Holding down the SHIFT key prevents Microsoft Excel from opening any of
   the files in the Alternate Startup File Location.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Preferences. Click the General tab.

<P><LI>Clear the Alternate Startup File Location box, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Quit and restart Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition. When you do this,
   the problem does not occur.
<P>
</OL>Note that you can also correct this problem by quitting Microsoft Excel and
deleting the Excel Settings (8) file, which is stored in the following
folder:
<P>
<PRE>   System Folder:Preferences

</PRE></OL>However, if you delete this file, you lose other settings that are
associated with Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition. After the settings
file is deleted, Microsoft Excel starts correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition. This
problem does not occur if the folder you specify in the Alternate Startup
File Location box contains only readable files (for example, workbooks, add-
ins, text files, and so on).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, you can set an alternate startup
file location. When you do this, all of the files in the specified folder
are automatically opened when you start Microsoft Excel. To set the
alternate startup file location, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Preferences. Click the General tab.

<P><LI>In the Alternate Startup File Location box, enter the path to the
   folder that contains the files that you want to open when you start
   Microsoft Excel, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Macintosh HD:My Data Files:Excel Files:
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Include the trailing colon (:).
<P>
   If you do not know the path, click the Select button to the right of
   the box. Select the folder you want to use, and then click the Select
   button at the bottom of the dialog box.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P></OL>
