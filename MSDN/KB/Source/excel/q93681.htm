<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, a cell that is blank because it contains a function or
formula that returns double quotation marks ("") may behave differently
from a cell that contains nothing. This difference in behavior occurs
because the quotation marks are treated as text.
<P>
If you copy a cell that contains a formula that returns empty double
quotation marks and paste the value of that cell to another cell, the
destination cell behaves the same as the cell that contains the formula,
even though the destination cell appears empty. The destination cell
behaves the same as the formula cell because the destination cell contains
an empty text value (thus, the cell is not really empty). To clear the cell 
(and make it completely empty), select it and click Clear on the Edit menu.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, a common way to create a cell that appears to be blank
is to use a formula that returns empty double quotation marks, as in the
following example:
<P>
<PRE>   B1: =IF(A1&gt;0,A1,"")

</PRE>NOTE: In this formula, there is no space between the quotation marks.
<P>
In the above formula, if the value in cell A1 is zero or less than zero,
cell B1 will appear blank. If the value in cell A1 is greater than zero,
cell B1 will contain the same value as cell A1.
<P>
When you sort cells containing formulas that return empty double quotation
marks, they are placed above blank cells (Microsoft Excel treats these
cells as if they contain text).
<P>
NOTE: These cells will be placed below blank cells if you are sorting in
descending order.
<P>
When you use cells containing formulas that return empty double quotation
marks in the plot range for a chart, the result for the point values of
those cells is zero. For example, a line chart shows a continuous line
going from the previous point to zero and then to the next point. Blank
cells, however, result in a break in the line rather than a zero value.
<P>
Note that when you plot a cell that contains an error value, such as #N/A,
the value is interpolated on a line chart. You can use the following
example to return an error value in a cell:
<P>
<PRE>   B1: =IF(A1&gt;0,A1,NA())

</PRE>If you create an xy (scatter) chart and use =NA() in a cell, it still will
plot the data points, the line is still connected on the xy (scatter) 
chart, even though the Do Not Plot option button in the Chart tab on the 
Tools Options menu is selected. However, if you delete the contents of that 
same cell, it does not plot it on the xy (scatter) chart.
