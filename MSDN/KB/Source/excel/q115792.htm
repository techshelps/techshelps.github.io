The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Query for Windows 95, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a query in Microsoft Query, the query is first executed, then
the query design file is saved. In addition, the query results are always
displayed when the query file is reopened (regardless of the setting for
Automatic Query on the Records menu).
<P>
NOTE: The second paragraph on page 28 of the "Microsoft Query User's Guide"
states that the result set will be displayed when the query is opened,
unless Automatic Query was off when the query was last saved. Microsoft
Query does not behave this way.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed above.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The query design file saves information that specifies which tables the
data should be accessed from. It also specifies which field names are to be
retrieved and how they should be displayed. It can save criteria to limit
the data that is retrieved. The query file that is saved using the Save
Query command on the File menu does not include the data in the result set.
<P>
Microsoft Query has an option to Automatically display the result set for
the query based on the fields and criteria set in the query window. If this
option is toggled off, then dragging a field down to the query window will
not automatically execute the query and display the result set. If
Automatic Query is turned off, and the query is saved, the query is
executed and the result set is shown in the query window. When the query is
then reopened, the query is again executed, regardless of the Automatic
Query setting.
