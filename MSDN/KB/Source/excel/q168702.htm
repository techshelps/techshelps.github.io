The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Query 97 for Windows, version 8.0
</UL>

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to return data from Microsoft Query 97 to a Microsoft
Excel 97 worksheet, the spinning globe icon (which signifies that a query
is processing) may appear for a period of time, and then no data is
returned to your worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Disable "Enable Background Refresh"</h3>
 
<P>
To prevent the query from being executed in the background, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create your query in Microsoft Query, and then choose to return the
   data to Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Click the Properties button in the "Returning External Data to Microsoft
   Excel" dialog box.

<P><LI>Clear the "Enable Background Refresh" check box, and click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK to return the results of your query to the worksheet.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: When the "Enable Background Refresh" option is disabled, you will not
be able to perform other tasks when this query is executed.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Move Your Mouse Pointer</h3>
 
<P>
If you move your mouse pointer continuously while the data is being
returned to Microsoft Excel, the query may not fail. Do not stop moving the
mouse until all of the data has been returned to Microsoft Excel. Please
note that depending on your query, it may take several minutes to return
the results of your query to the worksheet.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3: Paste the Data into the Worksheet</h3>
 
<P>
To paste the data from Microsoft Query into the worksheet, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Query, create the appropriate parameters for your query.

<P><LI>Select an item in the data pane.

<P><LI>Press CTRL+SHIFT+SPACEBAR to select all of the data in the data pane.

<P><LI>Click Copy on the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Activate Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Click Paste on the Edit menu.
<P>
</OL>The data will be pasted onto your worksheet.
<P>
NOTE: When you use this method, none of the parameters used to query your
database are saved with the data, so the Refresh Data command cannot be
used to update the results of the query. As a result, you must follow these
steps each time the query requires an update.
<P>
