<P>
 
This information applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Under certain conditions, when you attempt to open a Lotus 1-2-3 WK1
or WK3 file in Microsoft Excel you may receive one or both of the
following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Not enough Memory

   -and/or-

   Not enough system resources to display completely

</PRE>In some cases, Microsoft Excel may hang (requiring you to reboot). To
import the file successfully, follow the appropriate procedure below.
<P>
<PRE>           IF YOU RECEIVE BOTH ERROR MESSAGES
           ==================================

</PRE>If you receive BOTH of the above error messages, the problem may be
related one of the following:
<P>
YOU ARE TRYING TO OPEN 3-DIMENSIONAL WK3
<P><h2>FILES THAT CONTAIN A LARGE NUMBER OF SHEETS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to open 3-dimensional WK3 files that contain a large
number of sheets, these multiple-sheet files are imported to Microsoft
Excel version 4.0 as workbooks. Microsoft Excel version 3.0 breaks
these files into individual worksheets. The maximum number of sheets
that can be contained within these multiple-sheet files and imported
successfully into Microsoft Excel will vary depending on your
available system resources and memory.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, open the file in Lotus 1-2-3 and delete
any blank or unnecessary sheets from the file. If there are no blank
or unnecessary sheets, break up the file either by cutting and pasting
some of the sheets into a new file or by using the Lotus 1-2-3 WK3
Translate Utility. This utility is available in Lotus 1-2-3 Release
3.x and in Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows. Note that using either of the
latter two methods will NOT preserve the integrity of any 3-D
references and data that is specific to WK3 functionality will be
lost.
<P>
To use the Translate Utility, run TRANS.EXE located in your Lotus
1-2-3 directory. Under From, select 123r3 and under To, select 123r2.
The translate utility lists what you will lose in doing this and then
prompts you for the file you want to translate as well as what the
output filename should be. Select Yes when prompted about whether or
not you want to translate all plies. Each ply is then extracted as a
separate file. If you indicated an output filename of SHEET.WK1, the
extracted files will be named SHEET0A.WK1, SHEET0B.WK1, SHEET0C.WK1,
and so on. You can then open these files individually in Microsoft
Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>YOU HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF GRAPHS STORED WITHIN THE FILE</h2>
 
<P>
For both 1-2-3 WK1 and WK3 files, if you have a large number of
graphs stored within the file, Microsoft Excel loads each graph into
individual chart windows. If there are a large number of windows
created while importing the graphs, your available system resources
may be depleted.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround for Microsoft Excel version 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
To prevent Microsoft Excel version 4.0 from creating individual charts
for each 1-2-3 graph, place the line following line in the
[WK? Settings] section of your EXCEL4.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   Load_Chart_Wnd=0

</PRE><h3>Workaround for Microsoft Excel Version 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 3.0, when you receive the dialog box asking
if you want to create the Lotus 1-2-3 graphs, choose the No button.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>     IF YOU RECEIVE "NOT ENOUGH MEMORY" OR IF MICROSOFT EXCEL HANGS
     ==============================================================

</PRE>When you receive a "Not enough memory" error message or if Microsoft
Excel hangs when you load a 1-2-3 .WK1 or .WK3 file, the worksheet may
contain an active cell table that includes a large number of blank
cells. To determine the extent of the active cell range, open the file
in 1-2-3 and press END+HOME; the last possible cell in 1-2-3 is
IV8192. If the lower-right cell is substantially beyond the range that
contains data, delete the unnecessary rows and columns, save the file,
and retry opening the file in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
Note: If the Lotus sheet is protected, using END+HOME will go to IV8192.
Protecting the Lotus file will produce an active cell table with a
large number of blank cells.
<P>
If you are working with a .WK3 multiple-sheet file, check the active
cell range on each sheet in the file using the process described
above. To navigate among the sheets, press CTRL+PAGE UP to move to the
next sheet and CTRL+PAGE DOWN to move to the previous sheet.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MICROSOFT EXCEL VERSION 4.0</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 4.0 only, another possibility may be a conflict
loading the Impress formatting file. Impress is an add-in built into
1-2-3 versions 2.2 and later that allows you to apply formatting such
as borders, shading, and fonts to your worksheet. When you save a
worksheet in 1-2-3, this formatting information is saved in a separate
file with the same name as your worksheet plus an .FMT filename
extension (if it was created in Lotus 2.x) or an .FM3 filename
extension (if it was created in Lotus 3.x or Lotus for Windows 1.x).
<P>
Rename the .FMT or .FM3 file, giving it a different filename
extension, and try opening the worksheet file in Microsoft Excel
again. If you are then able to open the worksheet file, the size and
complexity of the .FMT or .FM3 file may be draining the memory
available to Microsoft Excel or there may be some other problem with
the file. In either case, check your version of Microsoft Excel (from
the Help menu, choose About Microsoft Excel).
<P>
Microsoft Excel version 4.0a for Windows is a maintenance release that
improves the loading of Impress formatting files into Microsoft Excel.
If you do not have this version of Microsoft Excel, please contact
Microsoft Consumer Sales at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
Note that these problems should not occur when you open a Lotus 1-2-3 WK1
or WK3 file in Microsoft Excel version 5.0.
