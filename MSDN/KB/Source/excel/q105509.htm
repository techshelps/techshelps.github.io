<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 2.2, 3.0, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, you may receive the following error
message
<P>
<PRE>   Bad F-Line Instruction

</PRE>and your computer may hang (stop responding).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can be caused by any of the following:

<UL><LI>A damaged operating system
<LI>A damaged worksheet
<LI>INIT or extension conflicts
<LI>An inoperative math coprocessor.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information contains troubleshooting techniques you can use
to identify the cause of the "Bad F-Line" error message.
<P>
To determine if your Macintosh
<P><h3>operating system software is damaged</h3>
 
<P>
CAUTION: Before you follow these procedures, be sure you have a
system disk available that you can use to start your computer (in
case the system startup is erased from your hard disk).
<P>
To test for a corrupted System 7, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>If you are running security software such as DiskLock, Nightwatch, or
   Empower, disable it.

<P><LI>Place the Disk Tools disk in your disk drive (you can use any floppy
   disk that's suitable for your computer's configuration; that is, a disk
   that contains the same version of the System  software as your hard
   disk).

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel and try to duplicate the problem.
<P>
</OL>To test for a corrupted System 6.0.x, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>If you are running security software such as DiskLock, Nightwatch, or
   Empower, disable it before proceeding.

<P><LI>Place the Apple System Tools disk in the floppy disk drive (you can use
   any disk that's suitable for your computer's configuration; that is, a
   disk that contains the same version of the System software as your hard
   disk).

<P><LI>Remove the System file from the System Folder on the hard disk and place
   it in another folder level. This file should be saved so you can easily
   recover any special fonts or desk accessories that have been installed.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel and try to duplicate the problem.
<P>
</OL><h3>To determine if you have a damaged worksheet</h3>
 
<P>
If the worksheet you are using has been damaged or corrupted in some way,
you may receive the "Bad F-Line Instruction" message when you use the
worksheet. To determine if your worksheet is damaged, attempt to reproduce
the problem with a new worksheet.
<P>
If you can reproduce the problem using a new worksheet, your worksheet is
probably not damaged. If the worksheet appears to be damaged, you can copy
the worksheet's contents to a new worksheet or save the worksheet in the
SYLK format.
<P>
To determine if your computer is
<P><h3>experiencing INIT or extension conflicts</h3>
 
<P>
If you suspect that you have an INIT or extension conflict, try restarting
your Macintosh without the INITs and attempt to reproduce the problem.
<P>
To disable INITs on a Macintosh running System 7.5, use the Extensions
Manager in control panel.
<P>
To disable INITs and extensions on Macintosh running System 7, follow these 
steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the Finder, restart your computer. As the computer restarts, press
   and hold down the SHIFT key. You should receive the message "Welcome to
   Macintosh - Extensions off." Release the SHIFT key.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel and try to duplicate the problem.
<P>
</OL>To restart a Macintosh running System 6.0.x without INITs
 
<P>
To restart the computer, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start your computer from the Apple System Tools disk (or any
   disk suitable for your computer's configuration that contains
   the same version of the System software as the hard disk).

<P><LI>Remove the System file from the SYSTEM FOLDER on the hard disk
   and place it in another folder level. Save this file so you can
   easily recover any special fonts or desk accessories that have
   been installed.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel and try to duplicate the problem.
<P>
</OL>To determine if you have a damaged
or inoperative math coprocessor
 
<P>
To determine if your math coprocessor if functioning correctly, enter the
function =COS(PI()) into a empty cell on the worksheet. The cosine of pi is
-1; if you receive a result other that -1, you may have a bad coprocessor.
<P>
Before you attempt to remove or replace any of your computer's hardware,
consult your local hardware dealer or administrator.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the Macintosh family of computers, machine code instructions that
begin with the letter F, also known as "F-Line instructions," are
used by the math coprocessor (if one is present on your machine).
<P>
Microsoft Excel does not execute F-Line instructions unless you have a
math coprocessor. If, for some reason, an F-Line instruction fails to
execute properly when an operational math coprocessor is in the
computer, or if a math coprocessor has erroneously been detected, an
error may occur. This error will usually include the words "Bad F-Line
Instruction," and will usually cause Microsoft Excel to crash.
<P>
The disklocking utilities and security software mentioned above are
manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.
