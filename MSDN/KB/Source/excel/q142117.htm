<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are several methods that you can use to recover information from
damaged or corrupted files. This article discusses those methods and points
you to other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles that discuss the methods in
greater detail.
<P>
<P><h3>Methods for Recovering Data in Corrupted Microsoft Excel Files</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Use external references to link to the corrupted file.

<LI>If you can open the file, save it in the SYLK format.

<LI>Use the Revert To Saved Document command.

<LI>If a chart is linked to the corrupted file, use a macro to extract
   the data.

<LI>Use a utility to recover the information.

<LI>Use the Microsoft Excel 97 File Recovery Macro (Cleaner.xla).

<LI>Open the file in Microsoft Word.

<LI>Open the file by using Microsoft Excel Viewer.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Using External References to Recover Data</h3>
 
<P>
The most common method to recover information from a damaged file is to
extract the values from the file by using external references to link to
the file. The file structure must be complete; otherwise, Microsoft Excel
cannot read the information.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q75818.htm">Q75818</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL: Linking to Data in a Damaged File (4.0 and
               Earlier)

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q147216.htm">Q147216</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL: Linking to Data in a Damaged File (5.0 and Later)

</PRE><h3>Saving the File in the SYLK Format</h3>
 
<P>
If you can open the corrupted Microsoft Excel file, you can "filter"
it by saving the file in the SYLK format, closing the file and then
reopening it.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q45557.htm">Q45557</A></B>
   TITLE     : Handling Corrupted Microsoft Excel Files by Saving in
               the SYLK Format

</PRE><h3>Using the Revert To Saved Document Command to Recover Data</h3>
 
<P>
If you are editing a Microsoft Excel worksheet and the file accidentally
becomes corrupted before you have saved changes to the file, you can
recover the original worksheet by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Open and select the name of the file that
   you are editing. Note that a dialog box appears with the message
   "Revert to Saved Document?"

<P><LI>Click OK. The file you are editing reverts to the last saved
   version of the file.
<P>
</OL>For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q42730.htm">Q42730</A></B>
   TITLE     : Excel Msg: Revert to Saved Document

</PRE></OL><h3>Using a Macro to Extract the Data in a Chart</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and later, data may be retrieved from a
chart, even when the data is in an external worksheet or workbook. This
behavior can be useful in situations where the chart was created from or
linked to another file that is unavailable or has been damaged in some way.
When the source data to a chart is lost, you can still retrieve the data
from the chart itself by using a Visual Basic for Applications macro.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../vbapps/Q137016.htm">Q137016</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL: Macro to Extract Data from a Chart

</PRE><h3>Using a Utility to Recover Data</h3>
 
<P>
Utility programs for personal computers often include a file recovery
utility that you can use to recover damaged or corrupted files.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q109675.htm">Q109675</A></B>
   TITLE     : Excel: Utilities That Can Recover Damaged Files

</PRE><h3>Using the Microsoft Excel 97 File Recovery Macro to Recover Information</h3>
 
<P>
If you can open the workbook in Microsoft Excel 97, you can use the
Microsoft Excel 97 File Recovery Macro to re-create Excel worksheets, XLM
macro sheets, and module sheets in a new workbook. This macro also creates
a log file so that you can identify items that cause problems when you use
the macro to transfer them to the new worksheet. If the Microsoft Excel 97
File Recovery Macro fails, view the last entry in the log file to determine
which item causes the problem, and then re-create the workbook without that
item.
<P>
To find information about this macro, go to the chapter on the Office
Resource Kit that is located at the following Internet address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/appa/appa.htm#ORKappaC4">http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/appa/appa.htm#ORKappaC4</A></B>

</PRE>NOTE: You can also download the macro from this Web site.
<P>
To download the macro, go to the following Internet address
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://premium.microsoft.com/msdn/library/officedev/office/appa/appa.htm">http://premium.microsoft.com/msdn/library/officedev/office/appa/appa.htm</A></B>

</PRE>and scroll to the "Microsoft Excel 97 File Recovery Macro" section.
<P>
To find information about this macro in the "Office 97 Resource Kit" book,
see Appendix A, pages 1027-1028. Note that the macro is referenced by the
Cleaner.xla add-in that contains it.
<P>
To find this macro in the Office Resource Kit compact disc, insert the disc
and open the following folder on the CD-ROM drive (usually drive D):
<P>
<PRE>   Excel\Recover

</PRE>The macro on the disc is in the Cleaner.xla add-in.
<P>
<P><h3>Open the File in Microsoft Word</h3>
 
<P>
If you have the Microsoft Excel converter installed, you may be able to
open your Microsoft Excel workbook in Microsoft Word. If the file does open
in Microsoft Word, you will not be able to recover module sheets, dialog
sheets, chart sheets, macro sheets, or any embedded charts. Also, you will
not recover any cell formulas, just the results of those formulas that are
currently in the cells.
<P>
Open the File by Using Microsoft Excel Viewer
 
<P>
If Microsoft Excel Viewer is installed, you may be able to open the
Microsoft Excel workbook. However, cannot recover module sheets, dialog
sheets, chart sheets, or macro sheets. Also, you cannot recover any cell
formulas; you can recover only the results of the formulas that are
currently in the cells.
<P>
For more information about Microsoft Excel Viewer, use your Web browser to
go to the Microsoft Web page at the following address:
