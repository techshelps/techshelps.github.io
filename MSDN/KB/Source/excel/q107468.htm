<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you may be unable to complete certain actions or use
certain add-in functions on worksheets when the name of the worksheet
contains an apostrophe (').
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, the apostrophe is a special character you can use in
references. If you include a workbook path in the reference, or if the
workbook or sheet name contains space characters, or if the sheet name
begins with a number, you must enclose the path, filename, and
sheet name in apostrophes. For example, a formula that refers to
cell A1, on a worksheet called 1994 Figures, in BOOK1.XLS, would appear as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   ='[BOOK1.XLS]1994 Figures'!$A$1

</PRE>Note that the apostrophes enclose the workbook and worksheet names. The
apostrophes are necessary because the space between 1994 and Figures could
be interpreted as a divider between items.
<P>
If the name of your worksheet contains an apostrophe, and you want to
reference a range on this worksheet, you must add another apostrophe to the
reference in order to distinguish the apostrophe in the name from
apostrophes that enclose a name. For example, to reference cell A1 on the
worksheet "1995's Forecasts" in BOOK1.XLS, use the following formula:
<P>
<PRE>   ='[BOOK1.XLS]1995''s Forecasts'!$A$1

</PRE>If your worksheet name contains an apostrophe, you may be unable to
complete certain operations that use the worksheet name. Examples of these
operations are shown below.
<P>
In general, avoid using apostrophes in your worksheet names.
<P>
<P><h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Print Area not Retained in a View</h3>
 
<P>
If the name of your worksheet contains an apostrophe, and you create a
view, using View Manager, the print area that is set for the view may not
be retained.
<P>
Workaround:
<P>
To retain the print area set for a view created with View Manager, you must
rename the worksheet with a name that does not contain any apostrophes, and
then you need to recreate the view.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Delete Locally Defined Names</h3>
 
<P>
If the name of your worksheet contains an apostrophe, you cannot delete
locally defined names on the worksheet. when you select the name in the
Define Name dialog box and choose Delete, you receive the error message
"That name is not valid" appears and the name is not deleted.
<P>
Workaround:
<P>
To delete a locally defined name, such as '1995''s Forecasts'!Print_Area,
you must rename the worksheet with a name that does not contain any
apostrophes.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Create Locally Defined Names</h3>
 
<P>
If you try to create a local name on a worksheet when the worksheet name
contains an apostrophe, you receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   That name is not valid.

</PRE>and the name will not be added.
<P>
Workaround:
<P>
To create a local name on a worksheet when the worksheet name contains an
apostrophe, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Rename the worksheet with a name that does not contain an apostrophe.

<P><LI>Create the local names.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Once you have defined your local names, if you rename the sheet to
the name with the apostrophe, you may receive the error message "Cannot
Delete Locally Defined Names."
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Return Data from Microsoft Query</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the Get External Data command, and you return query data from
Microsoft Query to a worksheet name contains an apostrophe (or a space),
the data is instead returned to the worksheet that was active when you
chose the Get External Data command.
<P>
Workaround:
<P>
To avoid this behavior, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Activate the worksheet with the name that contains the apostrophe (or
   space) before you click the Get External Data command.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Rename the worksheet to a name that does not contain an apostrophe or a
   space.
