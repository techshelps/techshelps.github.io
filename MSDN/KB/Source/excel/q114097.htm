The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have both Microsoft Excel version 4.0, and Microsoft Excel
version 5.0 installed on your computer, when you link information
from a worksheet in Microsoft Excel to a document in another
application, you receive an error message if you edit or update the
linked information while Microsoft Excel version 4.0 is running.
<P>
Note that the error message appears whether the information is linked
from a Microsoft Excel version 4.0 or 5.0 file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this behavior, when you have both Microsoft Excel versions
4.0 and 5.0 installed on your system, exit Microsoft Excel version
4.0 before you update or edit the linked information.
<P>
Note that when you use this workaround to edit linked information
from a Microsoft Excel 4.0 worksheet, the worksheet containing the
linked information is opened in Microsoft Excel version 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you edit or update linked information from a Microsoft Excel
worksheet, when you have both Microsoft Excel versions 4.0 and 5.0

application).

Microsoft Word:
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot edit the Microsoft Excel Worksheet

</PRE>If you update information linked from a Microsoft Excel worksheet as

   message appears (note that the workaround above won't work in this
   case):

      sure the application is properly installed, and that it has not been
      deleted, moved or renamed.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>Microsoft Access</h3>
 
<P>
