<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a row or column is deleted or inserted in a Microsoft Excel
worksheet, the chart and legend will update incorrectly because the
SERIES formula is using absolute referencing.
<P>
If a row or column of data gets deleted from a worksheet, the
corresponding SERIES formula will still be referencing those empty
cells. The empty cells will be returning zeros for data, resulting in
a data series that is invisible against the X axis. If a legend is
included in the chart, the legend will still have a pattern for the
invisible series.
<P>
To remove the pattern, delete the invisible series from the chart as
follows:

<OL><P><LI>Use the arrow keys to select sections of the chart until the series
   is located and the corresponding SERIES formula appears in the
   formula bar.

<P><LI>Use the F2 key to activate the formula bar, backspace over the
   SERIES formula and press ENTER, or select the SERIES formula with
   the mouse and delete the series.
<P>
</OL>The following is the only workaround to prevent the chart from updating
incorrectly:

<OL><P><LI>Select the chart series one at a time and replace each SERIES
   formula's absolute references with names.

<P><LI>Go to the corresponding spreadsheet and from the Formula menu,
   choose Define Name to define the absolute references as the names
   previously used in the SERIES formulas.
<P>
</OL>This technique only works when the rows or columns are being
inserted or deleted above or below the block of data being
used for the chart.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
On an Excel chart, each of the data series corresponds to data on the
spreadsheet through SERIES formulas, which use absolute references. A
SERIES formula consists of four arguments, as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Location of series name in the worksheet

<P><LI>Location of category labels in the worksheet

<P><LI>Location of values in the worksheet

<P><LI>Position of the series in the sequence of series in the chart
<P>
</OL>The following is a sample SERIES formula
<P>
<PRE>   =SERIES(Sheet1$A$3,Sheet1!$B$1:$C$1,Sheet1!$B$3:$C$3,2)

</PRE></OL>where "Sheet1$A$3" refers to the location of the series name in the
worksheet, "Sheet1!$B$1:$C$1" refers to the location of the category
label in the worksheet, "Sheet1!$B$3:$C$3" refers to the location of
the values in the worksheet, and "2" refers to the position of the
series in the sequence of series in the chart.
