The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you filter a list using computed criteria, and the
following conditions are true

<UL><LI>The computed criteria contains a shared formula
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The criteria is on a different worksheet from your list
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The formula contains a defined name
<P>
</UL>you receive a general protection (GP) fault when the cell that the defined
name refers to changes.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when you change the value in the cell that the defined
name refers to, when the defined name is used as a computed criteria on a
worksheet other than the worksheet that contains the list. This problem
occurs when you use the Advanced Filter feature to filter the list.
<P>
Note that if you use one of the database functions such as DCOUNT() under
the above conditions, you may either receive a GP fault, or the value in
the computed criteria may not change when you change the value in the cell
that the defined name refers to.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving a GP fault when you use a computed criteria on one
sheet, with a list on another worksheet, do any of the following:

<UL><LI>Do not use a cell that contains a shared formula as the computed
   criteria.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Refer to the cell that contains the computed criteria value by using
   the cell reference, such as =A1, instead of a defined name.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use a computed criteria that is located on the same sheet as the list.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
