The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you print a worksheet from Microsoft Excel 7.0, one character on
either the right or left side of a cell may not be printed. For example,
the word "August" may be printed as "ugust" (without the letter "A").
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You format the cell with a center horizontal alignment by clicking Cells
   on the Format menu, clicking the Alignment tab, and clicking Center
   under Horizontal.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The contents of the cell are almost exactly the same width as the
   width of the cell, including the gridlines on the right and left sides
   of the cell.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You are printing to a non-PostScript printer, such as a LaserPrinter.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: This problem does not occur if you view the worksheet in print
preview or if you print to a PostScript printer.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do any of the following:

<UL><LI>If one is available, print to a PostScript printer.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Add a space ( ) to both the beginning and ending of the cell so that
   the contents of the cell extend into the cells to the left and right
   of the active cell.
<P>
   In many cases, this step prevents the problem from occurring, and the
   text remains centered in the cell.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Increase or decrease the width of the cell so that the contents of
   the cell are narrower than the cell or the contents are wider than the
   cell (so that the contents extends into the cells to the left and right
   of the cell).
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because of the way in which Microsoft Excel 7.0 sends
information to the printer when you print a worksheet. If a character in a
cell with centered horizontal alignment touches, but does not cross, the
gridlines to the left or right of the cell, the character may not be
printed.
