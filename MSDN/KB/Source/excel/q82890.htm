<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel Solver uses the Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG2)
Algorithm for optimizing nonlinear problems. This algorithm was developed
by Leon Lasdon, of the University of Texas at Austin, and Allan Waren, of
Cleveland State University.
<P>
Linear and integer problems use the simplex method with bounds on the
variables and the branch and bound method, implemented by John Watson and
Dan Fylstra, of Frontline Systems, Inc.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel Solver uses iterative numerical methods that involve
"plugging in" trial values for the adjustable cells and observing the
results calculated by the constraint cells and the optimum cell. Each trial 
is called an "iteration." Because a pure "trial and error" approach would 
an extremely long time (especially for problems involving many adjustable 
cells and constraints), Microsoft Excel Solver performs extensive analyses 
of the observed outputs and their rates of change as the inputs are varied, 
to guide the selection of new trial values.
<P>
In a typical problem, the constraints and the optimum cell are functions of 
(that is, they depend on) the adjustable cells. The (first derivative of a 
function measures its rate of change as the input is varied. When there are 
several values entered, the function has several partial derivatives 
measuring its rate of change with respect to each of the input values; 
together, the partial derivatives form a vector called the gradient of the 
function.
<P>
Derivatives (and gradients) play a crucial role in iterative methods in 
Microsoft Excel Solver. They provide clues as to how the adjustable cells 
should be varied. For example, if the optimum cell is being maximized and 
its partial derivative with respect to one adjustable cell is a large 
positive number, while another partial derivative is near zero, Microsoft 
Excel Solver will probably increase the first adjustable cell's value on 
the next iteration. A negative partial derivative suggests that the related 
adjustable cell's value should be varied in the opposite direction.
<P>
<P><h3>Forward and Central Differencing</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel Solver approximates the derivatives numerically by moving
each adjustable cell value slightly and observing the rate of change of
each constraint cell and the optimum cell. This process is called a finite
difference estimate of the derivative. Microsoft Excel Solver can use
either forward differencing or central differencing, as controlled by the
Derivatives choice on the Solver Options dialog box.
<P>
Forward differencing uses a single point (that is, set of adjustable cell
values) that is slightly different from the current point to compute the
derivative, while central differencing uses two points in opposite
directions. Central differencing is more accurate if the derivative is
changing rapidly at the current point, but requires more recalculations.
The default choice is forward differencing, which is fine in most
situations.
<P>
Linear problems can be solved with far less work than nonlinear problems;
Microsoft Excel Solver does not need to recompute changing derivatives, and 
it can extrapolate along straight lines instead of recalculating the
worksheet. These time savings are brought into play when you select the
Assume Linear Model check box in the Solver Options dialog box. If you
don't select this box, Microsoft Excel Solver can still solve the problem,
but it will spend extra time doing so.
<P>
When you know that a problem is completely linear, choosing the Assume
Linear Model option will speed up the solution process by a factor of
two to twenty times (depending on the size of the worksheet). The downside 
is that, if the real worksheet formulas are nonlinear and this option is 
selected, you solve the wrong problem.
<P>
Although Microsoft Excel Solver does check the final solution when Assume
Linear Model is checked using a full worksheet recalculation, this is not
an absolute guarantee that the problem is truly linear. You can always
recheck the solution by running the same problem with the check box
cleared.
<P>
Many business worksheets contain mostly linear formulas plus a few key
nonlinear relationships, such as the Revenue equals Price times Unit Volume 
example cited earlier. These problems are not amenable to the methods of 
linear programming or the Assume Linear Model option. They require the full 
power of nonlinear programming. The Generalized Reduced Gradient method 
used by Microsoft Excel Solver is quite efficient for problems of this type 
because it uses linear approximations to the problem functions at a number 
of stages in the solution process; when the actual functions are linear, 
these approximations are exact.
<P>
<P><h3>Optimality Conditions</h3>
 
<P>
Because the first derivative (or gradient) of the optimum cell measures its 
rate of change with respect to (each of) the adjustable cells, when all of 
the partial derivatives of the optimum cell are zero (that is, the gradient 
is the zero vector), the first-order conditions for optimality have been 
satisfied (some additional second order conditions must be checked as well) 
having found the highest (or lowest) possible value for the optimum cell.
<P>
<P><h3>Multiple Locally Optimum Points</h3>
 
<P>
Some problems have many locally optimum points where the partial
derivatives of the optimum cell are zero. A graph of the optimum cell
function in such cases would show many hills and valleys of varying heights 
and depths. When started at a given set of adjustable cell values, the 
methods used by Microsoft Excel Solver will tend to converge on a single 
hilltop or valley floor close to the starting point. But Microsoft Excel 
Solver has no sure way of knowing whether there is a taller hilltop, for 
example, some distance away.
<P>
The only way to find the global optimum is to apply external knowledge of
the problem. Either through common sense reasoning about the problem or
through experimentation, you must determine the general region in which the
global optimum lies and start Microsoft Excel Solver with adjustable cell
values that are within that region. Alternatively, you can start Microsoft
Excel Solver from several different, widely separated points and see which
solution is best.
