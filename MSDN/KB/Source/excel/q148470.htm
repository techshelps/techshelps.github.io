The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, when you click the Help button from
within the Function Wizard while a Microsoft Excel 4.0 Macro sheet is
active, you may receive an error message similar to the following
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find 'MS Excel Macro Function'. Please select

</PRE>and you are then able to locate the "MS Excel Macro Functions Help" file,
bringing up the relevant help topic. However, Microsoft Excel may not
remember the location of this file, and you will have to locate it each
time you click the Help button from within the Function Wizard.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the error message, or one very similar to it, if the full
path to this Help file, including the name of the Help file, exceeds 62
characters. For example, if the full path to this Help file is:
<P>
<PRE>   Mac HD:Microsoft Office:Microsoft Excel 5:MS Excel Macro Functions Help

</PRE>you may receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find 'MS Excel Macro Funct'. Please select

</PRE>The problem occurs in this example because the full path is 71 characters
in length and the search for this file stops at
<P>
<PRE>   Mac HD:Microsoft Office:Microsoft Excel 5:MS Excel Macro Funct

</PRE>which is 62 characters in total length.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To workaround this problem, you need to create an alias to the Help file.
The alias should be renamed to the abbreviated name that appears in the
error message.
<P>
Using the example provided in the "Cause" section above, you would do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Make an alias to the "MS Excel Macro Functions Help" file that is
   located in the "Mac HD:Microsoft Office:Microsoft Excel 5" folder.

<P><LI>Rename the alias to "MS Excel Macro Funct" (without the quotation
   marks).
<P>
</OL>You no longer receive the error message, as Microsoft Excel can now locate
the alias to the shortened name.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the full path to the "Microsoft Excel 5" folder is 62 characters or
more, the workaround mentioned above will not work. In this case, you
should uninstall Microsoft Excel and reinstall it to a folder that has a
much shorter path, ideally to a location where the full path length to the
Help file is no more than 62 characters.
<P>
