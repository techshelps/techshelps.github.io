The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, you may see the following message when you open a
Microsoft Excel 97 file that you previously saved in the Microsoft Excel 97
&amp; 5.0/95 Workbook file format:
<P>
<PRE>     &lt;Filename&gt; should be opened as read-only unless you need to save
      changes to it. Open as read-only?

</PRE>where &lt;Filename&gt; is the name of the file that you are opening.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when all of the following conditions true:

<UL><LI>You save the file in the Microsoft Excel 97 &amp; 5.0/95 Workbook file
   format in Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You open the file in Microsoft Excel version 5.0 or 7.0 and click No
   when you are prompted to open the file as read-only.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You then save the file with the same name from Microsoft Excel
   version 5.0 or 7.0.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: The Microsoft Excel 97 portion of the file format no longer exists.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In order to recover the workbook in the Microsoft Excel 97 &amp; 5.0/95
Workbook file type, you must use a backup copy of the original file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, you can use a new hybrid file format that allows you
to save a file in both the Microsoft Excel 97 workbook format and the
Microsoft Excel 5.0 and 7.0 workbook format. This dual file format allows
you to open and view the file in Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0. It also allows
you to maintain the advanced features in Microsoft Excel 97. A workbook
that you save in this format contains two file formats; its file size is
roughly twice as large as the Microsoft Excel 97 format. Note that
Microsoft Excel 5.0 and 7.0 do not recognize the Microsoft Excel 97 portion
of the file. When you open and revise the file in Microsoft Excel 97, the
changes are automatically updated in the Microsoft Excel 5.0 and 7.0
portion of the file.
<P>
NOTE: If you edit the file and save the changes in Microsoft Excel 5.0 or
7.0, the Microsoft Excel 97 portion of the file is permanently lost, and
the file contains only the data in the remaining Microsoft Excel 5.0 and
7.0 workbook file portion.
<P>
The Read-Only Recommended option is selected for the Microsoft Excel 5.0
and 7.0 portion of the file. However, you can still open and save the file
in Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0. Because Read-Only Recommended is selected by
default for the Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 Workbook format, the workbook file
that you save also uses the Read-Only Recommended setting.
<P>
Disabling the Prompt and Resaving in the Microsoft Excel 97 &amp; 5.0/95 File
Format
