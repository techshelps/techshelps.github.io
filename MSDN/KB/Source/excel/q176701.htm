The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a workbook in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition and you
copy and paste an ActiveX Control or run a Visual Basic for Applications
macro, you may receive one or more of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   The application "unknown" has unexpectedly quit, because an error of
   type 3 occurred.

   Run-time error '57121':
   Can't exit design mode because Control 'CheckBox1' can not be created.

   Run-time error '32809':
   Application-defined or object-defined error

   Run-time error '1004':
   Cannot start the source application for this object. There may not be
   enough memory available.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because you cannot use ActiveX Controls (also called
OCX files) in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition. For specific
information about each of these error messages, please see the "More
Information" section in this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
ActiveX Controls are not supported in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
If you open a workbook that contains any ActiveX Control, you may receive
error messages when you perform certain actions, or the workbook may not
function correctly. The following sections describe some of the problems
that you may experience in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition when you
use a workbook that contains an ActiveX Control.
<P>
<P><h3>You Cannot Insert ActiveX Controls in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows, there are two primary methods you can
use to insert an ActiveX Control into a worksheet or into a custom
UserForm. These methods are as follows:

<UL><LI>To insert an ActiveX Control into a worksheet in Microsoft Excel 97,
   point to Toolbars on the View menu, and click Control Toolbox. Click the
   button for the control in the Control Toolbox, and then draw a control
   on the worksheet. Note that you can add buttons for unlisted controls by
   clicking More Controls.

<LI>To insert an ActiveX Control into a custom UserForm, click any of the
   tools in the Toolbox, and draw a control in the UserForm. You can add
   buttons for unlisted controls to the Toolbox by right-clicking the
   Toolbox and clicking Additional Controls on the shortcut menu.
<P>
</UL>In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, there is no Control Toolbox
toolbar; therefore, you cannot insert ActiveX Controls into a worksheet.
Note, however, that you CAN use the Forms toolbar to insert a limited
selection of controls into a worksheet.
<P>
Also, you cannot add unlisted controls to the Toolbox when you are working
with a UserForm in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition. You can use only
the default controls that are included in the Toolbox. These controls are
not ActiveX Controls; therefore you can use them in UserForms.
<P>
<P><h3>Issues Working with Controls Created in Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
Behavior of Controls in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition:
<P>
If you are working with a workbook that was created or modified in
Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows, and the workbook contains one or more
ActiveX Controls in a worksheet, the controls do not work when you open the
workbook in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
Or, if you are working with a workbook that contains a UserForm that
contains controls, the controls work only if they are one of the default
controls that you can insert from the Toolbox. Nondefault (unlisted)
controls do not work in UserForms in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
The two known issues that may occur when you open such a workbook in
Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition are as follows:

<UL><LI>The workbook opens, but the controls may appear as rectangles with red
   "X" symbols.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You receive a number of "Graphics Filter Converting" messages. When the
   workbook opens, the controls appear, but they do not work. You cannot
   select them with the mouse and delete them.
<P>
</UL>Behavior of Controls When you Copy and Paste Them:
<P>
If you attempt to copy and paste a control by copying the cells behind the
control, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The application "unknown" has unexpectedly quit, because an error of
   type 3 occurred.

</PRE>Or, the control may be pasted correctly but does not work when you click
it.
<P>
If you copy and paste a control, save the workbook, and then reopen the
workbook in Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows, the new control does not work
correctly. However, all other controls in the workbook still work when you
reopen the workbook in Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows. If you do not copy
and paste the controls in Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, the
controls work when you reopen the file in Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
Visual Basic for Applications Code May Fail When
<P><h3>a Worksheet Contains an ActiveX Control</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, if you open a workbook and then
run a Visual Basic procedure that performs any actions that involve a
worksheet that contains an ActiveX Control, you may receive error messages
similar to either of the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '57121':
   Can't exit design mode because Control 'CheckBox1' can not be created.

   Run-time error '32809':
   Application-defined or object-defined error

</PRE>For example, the error may occur when you run a macro that contains one of
the following lines of code:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveSheet.Controls.Delete

   xName = Sheets(1).Name   'where Sheets(1) contains a control

</PRE>If these problems occur, open the workbook in Microsoft Excel 97 for
Windows and remove the ActiveX Controls from the worksheet. After you
remove the controls and save the workbook, the problems do not occur in
Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
