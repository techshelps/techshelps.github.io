<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, you may receive the following error message when you
run a recorded macro:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '-2147024809 (80070057)':
   The item with the specified name wasn't found.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you resize a line or arrow while recording a
Visual Basic for Applications macro and then run the macro.
<P>
If you resize a line or arrow while recording a macro, Microsoft Excel 97
writes the name of the line or arrow in the macro. When you run the macro,
if the name of the line or arrow noted in the macro is different from the
name of the selected line or arrow, you receive the error message.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, remove the "hard coded" line or
arrow name from the macro code before you run the macro. For example, if
the recorded macro code looks similar to the following
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.ShapeRange.Item("Line 4").Left = 65.25
   Selection.ShapeRange.Item("Line 4").Width = 204.75
   Selection.ShapeRange.Item("Line 4").Top = 34.5
   Selection.ShapeRange.Item("Line 4").Height = 182.25

</PRE>remove the Item("Line 4") from each line of code so that the code looks
similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Selection.ShapeRange.Left = 65.25
   Selection.ShapeRange.Width = 204.75
   Selection.ShapeRange.Top = 34.5
   Selection.ShapeRange.Height = 182.25

</PRE>The macro code will work correctly as long as the line or arrow is
selected.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
