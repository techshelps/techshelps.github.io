The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, when you open a workbook that was
previously saved in Microsoft Excel version 7.0 with the "Allow Multi-User
Editing" option turned on, you will receive the following message
<P>
<PRE>   '&lt;filename&gt;' is reserved by XL 95 users. Open Read Only!
   Enter password for write access, or open read only.

</PRE>where &lt;filename&gt; is the file you are trying to open.
<P>
The file can still be opened by clicking the Read Only button. However, if
you type a password in the Password box, the password will be considered
invalid.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the workbook that you are opening was saved
from Microsoft Excel version 7.0 as a shared file with "Allow Multi-User
Editing." Because Microsoft Excel version 5.0 does not support sharing
files between multiple users at the same time, you receive the error
message.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Excel version 7.0 for Windows 95, open the file
in Microsoft Excel version 7.0 and re-save the workbook with "Allow Multi-
User Editing" disabled. To do this, click Share Lists on the File menu.
Select the Editing tab and clear the Allow Multi-User Editing check box.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Open the file in Microsoft Excel version 5.0 as a read-only document. Then,
save the file with a different name.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. The password dialog box prevents the file from
being opened with write access privileges.
<P>
Allowing multiple users to edit a single file at the same time is a new
feature of Microsoft Excel version 7.0. Information is stored with the file
so that changes can be tracked and conflicts resolved between users.
Microsoft Excel version 5.0 cannot handle this type of information;
therefore, you are unable to open this type of file with write access.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about Shared Lists, click the Index tab in Microsoft
Excel 7.0 Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   shared lists

</PRE>and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Sharing a list with
other people" topic.
