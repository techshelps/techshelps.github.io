The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel,
   version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the online help for Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for
Microsoft Excel (SBFM), the version of Peachtree for Windows that is
supported by SBFM is incorrectly listed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
The driver for Peachtree version 3.5 is available as of 9/1/96.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q103005.htm">Q103005</A></B>
   TITLE     : SBFM: Contents of the README.TXT Peachtree Additional
               Driver

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the online help for SBFM in the section about "Types of accounting data
you can import", there is a table listing the different accounting packages
that are supported by SBFM. In this table, on the item for Peachtree for
Windows, the supported version listed is 3.x. This is incorrect as the
version of Peachtree for Windows that is supported by the driver that
originally ships with SBFM is 3.0. The correct version, though, is listed
on the back of the box in which SBFM ships.
<P>
Note, in the help file topic for Peachtree for Windows, there is
information that says the following:
<P>
<PRE>   The import filters and other drivers you need to import data from
   Peachtree for Windows Version 3.5 will be available within 30 days of
   your purchase. To order this driver directly from Microsoft, please call
   (800) 426-9400 and it will be shipped to you free of charge. You can
   access the driver electronically via the following online locations:
