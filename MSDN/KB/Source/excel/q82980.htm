The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 2.x, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Apple Macintosh System 7.0, 7.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following information discusses probable causes and possible solutions
for the following System 7 error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The application 'Excel' has unexpectedly quit.

</PRE><h2>CAUSES</h2>
 
<P>
An unexpected quit error message can occur for any of the following
reasons:

<UL><LI>The Desktop needs to be rebuilt

<LI>You attempt to load a corrupted document

<LI>There are multiple System Folders on the hard drive

<LI>There is a conflict with Extensions or Control Panels (INIT/CDEV)

<LI>There is a corrupted system file (System or Finder) or desktop file

<LI>There is a corrupted application, preferences, or toolbar file

<LI>There is hardware failure or incompatibility
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
The following are possible solutions for the above problems.
<P>
<P><h3>If the Desktop Needs to be Rebuilt</h3>
 
<P>
It is a good idea to rebuild your desktop periodically to prevent it
from becoming corrupted.
<P>
To rebuild the desktop file on a floppy disk, hold down COMMAND+OPTION
when you insert the disk into the drive. An alert will appear asking
if you want to rebuild the desktop.
<P>
To rebuild the desktop file on your hard drive, hold down
COMMAND+OPTION and choose Restart from the Special menu. Keep the keys
held down until the "Are you sure you want to rebuild your desktop..."
message appears.
<P>
<P><h3>If Attempting to Load a Corrupted Document</h3>
 
<P>
In some cases, a document can become so corrupted that attempting to
load it will cause Excel to quit unexpectedly. To test this,
double-click on the Excel application to launch it and bring up a new
worksheet. If Excel does not quit, it may be that the original
document is corrupted.
<P>
For information on how to recover a corrupted Excel document, query on
the words:
<P>
<PRE>   recover and damaged and file and excel

</PRE><h3>If there are Multiple System Folders on the Hard Drive</h3>
 
<P>
The Macintosh recognizes any folder that contains both the System and
Finder files as a system folder. Multiple system folders on the same
disk can create many problems, ranging from unusual behavior to
complete system failure. To determine if more than one system folder
exists on a drive:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Find.

<P><LI>Type "System" (without quotation marks) in the "Find:" field and
   click OK.

<P><LI>The Macintosh will bring up the first occurrence of the word
   "System" within a file or folder name.

<P><LI>Press COMMAND+G or choose Find Again from the File menu until
   the system beeps without bringing up a new occurrence.
<P>
</OL>If more than one System file appears (File Find will also bring up
folders that match the search criteria), make a note of the folder
locations. If more than one of those folders contains both a System
and Finder file, there are multiple system folders on the drive and
all but one should be removed.
<P>
<P><h3>If there is a Conflict with Extensions or Control Panels (INIT/CDEV)</h3>
 
<P>
Extensions are INITs' (Initial programs) small programs within the
system folder that run on startup and generally add increased
functionality to the Macintosh. Control Panels, or CDEVs (Control
Device Programs), are INITs that act as hardware drivers or adjust
settings for hardware devices. INITs/CDEVs can create system conflicts
that may result in an unexpected quit.
<P>
To test for a conflict in the Extensions or Control Panels folders:

<OL><P><LI>Restart the Macintosh.

<P><LI>Hold down the SHIFT key while the computer reboots until the
   message "Welcome to Macintosh. Extensions Off." appears on the
   screen.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Some computer configurations require certain INITs/CDEVs to
function properly. These can include systems which make use of third
party hardware, such as monitors, accelerators, network cards, and so
on. Some password protection programs require their INITs to decrypt
the boot sector of the hard drive and allow startup.
<P>
IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE A BOOTABLE FLOPPY DISK FOR YOUR HARDWARE
CONFIGURATION BEFORE ALTERING THE SYSTEM FOLDER ON YOUR HARD DRIVE.
<P>
After disabling the extensions, if launching Excel and working with
documents does not produce an unexpected quit, an INIT/CDEV conflict
may be the source of the problem. Non-Apple files should be removed
from the Extensions and Control Panels folders as well as the root
level of the System Folder, and replaced one by one to test for the
problem file.
<P>
If Excel continues to quit unexpectedly, test for a corrupted System
or Finder file.
<P>
<P><h3>If there is a Corrupted System File</h3>
 
<P>
If problems persist after isolating the System and Finder, one or both
files may be corrupted. To test for a corrupted system:

<OL><P><LI>Boot from the Disk Tools disk (or any bootable floppy suitable for
   the computer's configuration that contains the same version of
   System 7 as the hard drive).

<P><LI>Remove the System file from the hard drive system folder and place
   it at another folder level. This file should be saved to easily
   recover installed fonts or sounds.

<P><LI>Drag a copy of the System and Finder files from the startup floppy
   disk to the system folder on the hard drive. This will replace
   those files with a fresh copy from the startup floppy.

<P><LI>Restart the computer and test Excel.
<P>
</OL>If Excel performs correctly, it is likely the system was corrupted.
<P>
NOTE: System file corruption can be created by Extension/Control Panel
conflicts. If this problem continues to arise, there may be a problem
with the Extensions and/or Control Panels in the System folder. In
particular, software developed for use under System 6.0.x should be
updated for use with System 7.
<P>
If Excel continues to quit unexpectedly, test for a corrupted
application or hardware conflict.
<P>
<P><h3>If there is a Corrupted Application or Preferences File</h3>
 
<P>
In some cases, Excel or its preferences files may have become
corrupted. To test for a corrupted preferences file:

<OL><P><LI>Remove Excel Settings from the system folder.

<P><LI>Launch Excel. A new Excel Settings file will be created using
   default information.
<P>
</OL>If the problem no longer persists, the Excel Settings file is probably
corrupted. This can happen in rare cases when the computer is
restarted by another application while Excel is running in the
background, or if the computer is shut down while Excel is writing to
the Preferences file.
<P>
If the problem persists, install Excel again from your Microsoft Excel
disks.
<P>
<P><h3>If there is Hardware Failure or Incompatibility</h3>
 
<P>
Some third party hardware may not be compatible with Excel. In other
cases, the hardware may not be configured properly or may be
malfunctioning. To test for hardware problems, contact the
manufacturer for advice on how to temporarily disable or remove the
equipment.
