The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a chart as a new sheet in Microsoft Excel 5.0, the chart
will appear in a view similar to print preview. (To create a new chart,
select the desired data on your sheet, choose the Chart command from the
Insert menu, and then choose As New Sheet.) This view shows how the layout
of your chart and all of its elements will look when you print it. In this
view, you can size, move, and format the plot area (the region bounded by
the axes) and chart items such as graphic objects, titles, text boxes, and
the legend.
<P>
This article discusses how options in Page Setup affect what you can move
and size in this view and how to change the view so that the chart fills
the window.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
How Options in Page Setup Affect What
<P><h3>You Can Move and Size in the Chart Window</h3>
 
<P>
The way the chart window appears on your screen and when you print it
depends on how you set various options in the Page Setup dialog box (these
options include paper size, orientation, and margin size). For example, if
the page orientation is set to Landscape, the window appears wider than it
is tall.
<P>
How this chart window appears on screen and when printed depends on the
settings you select in the Page Setup dialog box for items such as paper
size, orientation, and margin size. For example, if the page orientation is
set to Landscape, the window appears wider than it is tall. The option you
select under Printed Chart Size on the Chart tab in the Page Setup dialog
box affects how you can move and size the chart area, plot area and the
chart elements. When you select the full page option, you can size and move
the plot area but not the chart area. When you select the Scale to Fit Page
or Custom options, you can size both the plot area and the chart area. With
either of these options selected, chart elements such as titles, text boxes
and arrows, will move relative to the chart area.
<P>
The following table lists the Printed Chart Size options that are located
on the Chart tab, how they affect the way the chart is displayed and
printed, and how they affect what you can move and size.

</PRE><h3>How to Change the View So That the Chart Fills the Window</h3>
 
<P>
The chart window is zoomed in to display your entire chart area. To
view the chart in its full size on your screen, do either of the
following:

<UL><LI>Choose Zoom from the View menu, select 100% under Magnification,
   and choose OK.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Select 100% in the Zoom box on the Standard toolbar.
<P>
</UL>To display the chart as it would appear in Microsoft Excel 4.0 (that is,
with its size determined by the size of the window), choose Sized With
Window from the View menu. This will only affect the active chart. To make
this change for every new chart that you create:

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Options.

<P><LI>Select the Chart tab and select the Size With Window option.
<P>
</OL>Note that when you open a Microsoft Excel 4.0 chart in version 5.0, this
option will be selected by default. To display the chart in page layout,
clear this option.
