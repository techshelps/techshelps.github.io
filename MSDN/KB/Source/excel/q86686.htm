<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Camera tool in Microsoft Excel to create a picture of
an area of cells, if the area of cells has been defined by a name, the
Camera tool will reference the defined name instead of the cell
references.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Microsoft
Excel listed above. This problem was corrected in version 5.0 of Microsoft
Excel for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To illustrate this behavior, on a spreadsheet define a name to refer
to A1:D10. Select A1:D10 and use the Camera tool to create a picture
of that selection. The picture will refer to the defined name, not
A1:D10.
<P>
This aspect of the Camera tool's behavior allows the Camera tool to
take a picture of an area which has a defined name and have the
picture change as the definition of the name changes. For example, if
rows are added to the defined name, the camera picture would update to
include the new rows.
<P>
This behavior can cause unexpected results. If the defined name the
picture is linked to is deleted, Excel breaks the link from the
picture to the area of cells. Therefore, if the cells are changed the
picture does not update. However, the picture will maintain the link
to the defined name. So, if another area of the sheet is then assigned
the same name, the picture will update with the information from the
newly defined area.
<P>
To change the link in the picture from a defined name to cell
references, select the picture, edit the reference in the formula bar
to refer to the same area by highlighting the reference and using the
mouse to highlight the same area on the sheet or by typing the
reference to the area in the formula bar.
<P>
This procedure can also be used to change the information the picture
references to a different name or cell area.
