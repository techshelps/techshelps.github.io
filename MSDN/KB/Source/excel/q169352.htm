</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you remove one or more page breaks from a
worksheet when multiple worksheets are selected (that is, you are in group
edit mode), the page breaks may not be removed from all of the worksheets.
Specifically, the page breaks may not be removed from the last or next-to-
last selected worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/support/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>If you manually remove page breaks from a worksheet while multiple
worksheets are selected, make sure that you also switch to the last and
next-to-last selected worksheets and remove the page breaks from these
sheets.
<P>
If you are using a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro to remove
page breaks while multiple worksheets are selected, make sure that all of
the page breaks are correctly removed by including macro code similar to
the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ' Store the cell from which to remove page breaks.
   xCell = ActiveCell.Address

   ' For each worksheet that is currently selected...
   For Each xSheet In ActiveWindow.SelectedSheets

       ' remove the page breaks from the active cell in that worksheet.
       xSheet.Range(xCell).PageBreak = xlPageBreakNone

   ' Repeat for all selected worksheets.
   Next xSheet

</PRE>In this example, xCell is the cell that is immediately below and/or to the
right of a page break. When you run a macro that includes this code, the
macro removes the page breaks from the active cell in each of the selected
worksheets.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, you can manually remove a page break from a cell by
selecting the cell, and then clicking Remove Page Break on the Insert menu.
You can insert a page break by selecting the cell and clicking Page Break
on the Insert menu.
