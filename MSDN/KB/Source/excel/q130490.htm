<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information describes the new features in Microsoft Excel
version 7.0. Note that this information is available on the Contents tab
of the Microsoft Excel Help file when you open the What's New book.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a list of the new items in Microsoft Excel version 7.0,
followed by a description of each new feature:
<P>
<PRE>   Answer Wizard
   AutoCalculate
   AutoComplete
   AutoCorrect
   AutoFilter With Top 10
   Background for Worksheet (Note, this is not in the What's New list in
      Microsoft Excel help)
   Better Drag And Drop Editing
   CellTips And ScrollTips
   Data Map
   Easier Document Retrieval And Management
   Easier Number Formatting
   Shared Lists
   Templates And The Template Wizard

</PRE><h2>ANSWER WIZARD</h2>
 
<P>
To get help while you're working in Microsoft Excel, you can click Answer
Wizard on the Help menu. The new Answer Wizard uses IntelliSense technology
to determine the type of help you need. When you type a request in your own
words on the Answer Wizard tab, the wizard will supply answers that will
help you get your work done. You can also find assistance on the Contents
tab or the Index tab. To look for specific words or phrases, you can click
the Find tab.
<P>
<P><h2>AUTOCALCULATE</h2>
 
<P>
You no longer need to use a calculator or enter temporary formulas on a
worksheet when you want to quickly check a total. Now you can just select
the range you want to sum, and the answer will appear in the status bar at
the bottom of the screen. You can also average the selected numbers or
count the entries by clicking the AutoCalculate area in the status bar with
the right mouse button.
<P>
<P><h2>AUTOCOMPLETE</h2>
 
<P>
When you type the first few letters of an entry in a cell, Microsoft
Excel can complete the entry for you, based on the entries you've already
made in that column.
<P>
To see a custom list of possible cell entries on your worksheet, you can
click a cell using the right mouse button, and then click Pick From List.
<P>
IntelliSense technology automatically creates the list from the words
you've already typed in the column.
<P>
<P><h2>AUTOCORRECT</h2>
 
<P>
Like Word, Microsoft Excel can now automatically correct common mistakes as
you type. When you press ENTER, the correct text will be entered in the
cell. You can add entries to the AutoCorrect list by clicking AutoCorrect
on the Tools menu. You can also use AutoCorrect as a form of "shorthand."
For example, you can replace "Q1" with "1st Quarter" as you type.
<P>
<P><h2>AUTOFILTER WITH TOP 10</h2>
 
<P>
Using AutoFilter is a quick way to view a subset of your list, displaying
only those rows that contain selected values. You can now quickly find the
top or bottom values in a list without sorting. By customizing the Top Ten
options, you can find the values or percentages you want.
<P>
<P><h2>BACKGROUND FOR WORKSHEET</h2>
 
<P>
You can add a background graphic to worksheets. But, this background will
not be visible in Print Preview nor will it print out when you print your
workbook.
<P>
To insert a graphic as a background image for your worksheet, point to
Sheet on the Format menu and then click Background. Locate the graphic file
you want to use as the background image and then click OK.
<P>
<P><h2>BETTER DRAG AND DROP EDITING</h2>
 
<P>
You can easily move or copy selected ranges between worksheets and
workbooks. You can drag a range to another workbook by selecting the
range and then dragging it to a visible workbook window.
<P>
You can also drag a range to another worksheet in the same workbook by
holding down ALT while you drag the range to the tab for the other
workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>CELLTIPS AND SCROLLTIPS</h2>
 
<P>
When you click and drag the scroll box to see other parts of a worksheet, a
scroll tip shows the row or column you will move to. You can add
explanatory information to individual worksheet cells. CellTips
automatically display the notes you've added to cells. You an add a note to
a cell by clicking Note on the Insert menu. You can view a CellTip by
pointing to a cell with a red dot in its upper-right corner.
<P>
<P><h2>DATA MAP</h2>
 
<P>
With a map, you can analyze sales or market research by geographic
region. You can do this by first arranging the information in columns on a
worksheet. One column must contain geographic data, such as names of
countries or states. You can create a map on your worksheet by selecting
the cell range, and then clicking the Data Map button.
<P>
You can use the demographic data included with Microsoft Data Map--such
as population or household income, along with your own data to recognize
trends and perform analysis in a map.
<P>
You can automatically add labels to map features, such as countries. You
can even create sets of custom labels to mark your important locations on
a map. You can save the custom labels as a pin map, and use them over and
over again. The Add Text button lets you add your own remarks to a map.
<P>
You can display different columns of data from the worksheet on the map
to perform analysis or to get the look you want for presentation. You also
specify a format for the data, such as dot density or graduated symbol.
<P>
<P><h2>EASIER DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL AND MANAGEMENT</h2>
 
<P>
Finding, opening, or managing documents is easy with Microsoft Office
applications. No matter which application you're using, you can click Open
on the File menu to open or find documents.
<P>
You can manage your documents right from the Open dialog box. You can use
the right mouse button to click the document name, and then click a command
on the shortcut menu. This procedure allows you for example to open, print,
delete, or create a shortcut for the selected file.
<P>
To find documents, you can open the folders you want to search, and then
specify search criteria. For example, you can find all documents that
contain a particular word or phrase. With the Advanced search options, you
can specify more detailed criteria based on file properties, and then save
the search criteria to use again.
<P>
You don't have to open a document to see its contents. You can select the
document, and then click the Preview button to preview its contents. You
can also click the List, Details, or Properties button to vary the
information shown for a selected document.
<P>
When you install your Microsoft Office applications, the Find Fast feature
can automatically index your documents so that you can find them faster.
You can also choose to run Find Fast manually from the Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h2>EASIER NUMBER FORMATTING</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel makes it easy to change number formats, without using
codes. New built-in formats have been added for some of the most common
number formatting tasks. New formats include Zip Code, Zip Code + 4, Phone
Number, and Social Security Number.
<P>
<P><h2>SHARED LISTS</h2>
 
<P>
You don't have to gather other users' information and update your tracking
lists yourself. You can now save the workbook as a shared list that
everyone can access, and you'll always have the latest information.
<P>
With a shared list, you and your coworkers can work on the list at the same
time, and Microsoft Excel keeps the information up to date. You can also
see who is working on a shared list.
<P>
In a shared list, you can enter data, insert rows and columns, and sort,
but you can't change cell formatting or save formulas.
<P>
When you click the Save button, the shared list is updated with your
changes. You'll also get everyone else's changes.
<P>
If entries in the shared list conflict, a message will ask you which change
to accept. You can also view a worksheet that lists conflicts and their
resolutions.
<P>
<P><h2>TEMPLATES AND THE TEMPLATE WIZARD</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel comes with new templates that can help you run your
business, plan your finances, and add consistency to the appearance and
organization of your data. Templates can contain formulas, formatting
text, and macros. You can create a workbook based on a built-in template.
You can also create templates from your own worksheets. You view CellTips
on the built-in templates to help you get started, and you can also
customize the built-in templates.
<P>
You can automatically copy the contents of cells to a database each time
you save a workbook that is based on a template. The Template Wizard
walks you through the steps of linking cells in the template to fields or a
Microsoft Excel list.
<P>
Some of the built-in templates already have links to a database. For
example, the Template Wizard links cells in the Invoice template to cells
in a Microsoft Excel list.
