<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, if you clear the print area in a
worksheet while recording an AppleScript script, you may receive an error
message similar to the following when you run the recorded script:
<P>
<PRE>   Execution Error
   Microsoft Excel got an error: Unable to set the PrintArea property of
   the PageSetup class

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
While recording a script, the following code is recorded in the script when
you clear the print area:
<P>
<PRE>   set PrintArea of PageSetup of ActiveSheet to "\"\""

</PRE>The section in quotation marks ("\"\"") is incorrect.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see

</PRE>AppleScript is manufactured by Apple Computer, Inc., a vendor independent 
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this 
product's performance or reliability. 
<P>
To work around this problem, modify the recorded code in the Script Editor
so that it resembles the following:
<P>
<PRE>   set PrintArea of PageSetup of ActiveSheet to ""

</PRE>When you run it, the script should correctly clear the print area.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the AppleScript Script Editor to record scripts that interact
with many programs, including Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh. When you
record such a script, every action you perform in Microsoft Excel is
recorded in the script. You can then run the script, and Microsoft Excel
performs the recorded actions.
<P>
When you record the clearing of the print area in a worksheet, the Script
Editor records the code incorrectly. When you run the code, Microsoft Excel
cannot clear the print area, and you receive the error message in the
"Symptoms" section of this article.
