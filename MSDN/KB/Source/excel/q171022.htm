The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Power Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, some most recently used file names on
the File menu appear incorrectly. Specifically, files with names that begin
with the word "Print" begin with "Fax" instead.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if Global Village Fax Center (GlobalFax) version 2.5.2
or 2.5.6 is installed on your computer, and you select it as the default
printer in the Chooser.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Although the most recently used file names may appear incorrectly on the
File menu, they open the correct files when you click them.
<P>
To resolve this problem, select a different default printer. To do this,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Apple menu, click Chooser.

<P><LI>In the list of printers, select a different printer.

<P><LI>Click Close. Click OK when you are prompted to choose Page Setup in
   open programs.
<P>
</OL>The most recently used files should correctly on the File menu.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you use Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh 5.0 or
5.0a or Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, and GlobalFax version 2.5.2
or 2.5.6.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

</PRE>When you select GlobalFax as the default printer, it searches the File menu
in Microsoft Excel. If any of the menu items on the File menu begin with
the word "Print," GlobalFax replaces the word "Print" with the word "Fax."
In this way, the Print, Print Preview, and Print Report menu commands are
changed into Fax, Fax Preview, and Fax Report.
<P>
If a most recently used file name begins with "Print," it is similarly
changed. However, the menu item starts the correct file; for example,
clicking the most recently used file name, "FaxMe," opens the "PrintMe"
file.
<P>
Note that files with names that begin with the word "print" (where "p" is
lowercase) are not affected by this problem. The name of the file must
begin with the word "Print" (where "p" is uppercase) for the problem to
occur.
