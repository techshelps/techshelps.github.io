<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you copy a portion of a Microsoft Excel chart as a picture (by
holding down SHIFT, then choosing Copy Picture from the Edit menu),
the graphic may paste in an unexpected size. Specifically, a graphic
copied using the As Shown When Printed option may print out larger or
smaller from the application it is copied to than it does from Excel.
<P>
This behavior occurs when the chart has been reduced or enlarged under
Page Setup in Excel and the Fit To Page or Full Page option under Size
has been chosen. If the chart has been reduced, it will paste (and
print) larger than expected and if it has been enlarged, it will paste
(and print) smaller.
<P>
This behavior does not occur when Screen Size is selected under Size
in Page Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Fit To Page expands a chart horizontally and vertically until a margin
restriction is reached (either horizontally or vertically).
<P>
Full Page expands a chart horizontally and vertically until all
margins are reached, to take up the maximum printable area on the
page.
<P>
When a chart is reduced in Excel, the margins are reduced along with
it. The Fit To Page or Full Page attributes expand the chart back out
to the margins, which are now smaller. Copy Picture As Shown When
Printed will incorporate this into the graphic and the pasted object
will become larger to fill the printable area.
<P>
When a chart is enlarged in Excel, the margins are enlarged along with
it. The Fit To Page or Full Page attributes expand the chart back out
to the margins, but now the margins are larger. Copy Picture As Shown
When Printed will incorporate this into the graphic and the pasted
object will become smaller to fill the printable area.
