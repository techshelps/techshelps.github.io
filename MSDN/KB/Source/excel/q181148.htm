   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from
               Online Services


                 Using the File Integration Wizard
                 =================================

</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
The File Integration Wizard for Microsoft Excel 97 integrates (combines)
data from one or more worksheets or from all worksheets in a selected
workbook into the current workbook. You can combine any file format that
Microsoft Excel can read. The wizard also allows you to perform operations
on the combined data. These operations include the following:

<UL><LI>Copy. Replaces text and values overwriting existing data.

<LI>Add. Adds numeric data from the selected file to the values in
   your workbook. Adds numeric data only and does not affect text.
   The File Integration Wizard discards incoming values when the
   value will overwrite a cell containing text. Also, when you use
   this operation, text in the extracted file is not admitted.

<LI>Subtract. Subtracts numeric data from the selected file from the
   values in your workbook. Subtracts numeric data only and does
   not affect text. The File Integration Wizard discards incoming
   values when the value will overwrite a cell containing text.
   Also, when you use this operation, text in the extracted file is
   not admitted.

<LI>Multiply. Multiplies numeric data from the selected file and the
   values in your workbook. Multiplies numeric data only and does
   not affect text. The File Integration Wizard discards incoming
   values when the value will overwrite a cell containing text.
   Also, when you use this operation, text in the extracted file is
   not admitted.

<LI>Divide. Divides numeric data from the selected file into the
   values in your workbook. Divides numeric data only and does not
   affect text. The File Integration Wizard discards incoming
   values when the value will overwrite a cell containing text.
   Also, when you use this operation, text in the extracted file is
   not admitted.

</UL><h3>Installing and Using the Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
To install and use the File Integration Wizard, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Download the Filecomb.exe to your Desktop. Run the Filecomb.exe to
   extract the Filecomb.xla add-in and copy it into the Library folder for
   Microsoft Excel 97. This folder is usually located in the following
   folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: You may now delete the file Filecomb.exe from your desktop.

<P><LI>In the Add-Ins dialog box of Microsoft Excel 97, click the File
   Integration Wizard check box, and then click OK. To run the File
   Integration Wizard, point to Wizard on the Tools menu and click File
   Integration.

<P><LI>In step 1 of the wizard, click Browse to locate the file you want to
   integrate. You are prompted to save the current workbook. If you never
   saved the file, the Save As dialog box appears, otherwise the workbook
   is automatically saved.

<P><LI>In step 2 of the wizard, click Entire File or Specified range. In the
   Cells to merge box, specify the range of cells you want to integrate,
   and then click Next.
<P>
   Note: if you click Entire File, the current workbook must have at least
   the same number of worksheets as the workbook from which you are
   extracting data.

<P><LI>In step 3 of the wizard, click an operation. By default, Copy is
   selected. In the cell range box, specify a single cell in which you want
   to begin integrating data, and then click Finish.
<P>
