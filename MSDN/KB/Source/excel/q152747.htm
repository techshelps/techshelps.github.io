The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel,
   version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel (SBFM)
is a software package that gives small businesses access to financial
modeling tools once used only by large corporations. The SBFM is designed
to help small businesses use the powerful analysis capabilities of
Microsoft Excel to understand how to be more profitable and make more sound
financial decisions.
<P>
The SBFM links the most popular business accounting programs to Microsoft
Excel for the Windows 95 operating system. It provides a set of easy-to-use
tools that enable users to import data from accounting programs into
Microsoft Excel, to create standard and customized reports, and to perform
"what if" analyses easily -- even if the user has never used a spreadsheet
before or has little formal financial training. With the SBFM, small-
business owners can view their financial information from a number of
perspectives, then manipulate financial variables to see the potential
effects on their bottom line. For example, small-business owners might want
to find out how increasing the production of a particular product line
would affect their revenue or whether it is more profitable to lease, buy
or finance the purchase of an asset.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager allows you to put your
accounting data to work by allowing you to generate flexible reports and
scenarios that you can view, manipulate, and analyze to manage your company
toward clear financial goals. How can you raise cash inflow by $1,000 a
month? What's the net effect of a 10-percent increase in sales? Even with
an excellent accounting system, these are not typically easy questions to
answer: they require a program that gives you the flexibility to experiment
with your data.
<P>
The Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel gives
you this flexibility: it imports data directly from your accounting system;
it creates reports to assess your financial position; then, it helps you
experiment to fine-tune future performance. The Microsoft Small Business
Financial Manager allows you to:

<UL><LI>View data from several sources.
<LI>Manipulate your data to understand it better.
<LI>Use you data to make predictions about the future.
<LI>Make business forecasts.
<P>
</UL><h3>View Data From Several Sources</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel imports
data automatically from most popular accounting packages. So, even if your
accounting system has changed over the years or you're an accounting
professional with clients who use several systems, you can still integrate
and view financial data from several sources with ease.
<P>
Once your data is imported, the Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager
for Microsoft Excel can create flexible standard financial reports
instantly. For example, you can create balance sheets, income statements,
trial balances, statements of change in retained earnings, and cash flow
reports.
<P>
<P><h3>Manipulate Your Data to Understand it Better</h3>
 
<P>
Unlike most financial reports, these reports are dynamic. If you want to
know where the summary numbers came from, click them for more detail. View
data from the big picture down to individual journal entries.
<P>
In addition, you can monitor and understand business performance with
reports that analyze sales, margin, and inventory results. You can drill
down to determine exactly where each dollar is going.
<P>
<P><h3>Make Business Forecasts</h3>
 
<P>
Perhaps the most powerful use of the Microsoft Small Business Financial
Manager for Microsoft Excel is forecasting. Your data is now available for
experimentation and what-if analysis of potential changes. This forecasting
functionality allows you to identify variables you would like to change,
see the effects of those changes, and steer your company toward a clear
financial goal.
<P>
For finance-oriented professionals, the Microsoft Small Business Financial
Manager for Microsoft Excel can be a major time saver. For business owners
who are unfamiliar with the details of financial management, it provides
powerful insight into how your business really works. From short-term
performance tuning to long-term strategic planning, the Microsoft Small
Business Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel helps you experiment,
forecast accurately, and take your business to the next level.
<P>
<P><h3>To Get a Quick Look</h3>

   Microsoft Excel with the Import Wizard.

<LI>Consolidate your data automatically into standard financial reports—such

   change in retained earnings, and cash flow reports—for any financial
   need, such as five-year planning, loans, or taxes.

<LI>View data in financial reports from the summary level down to individual
   accounts. The Reporting and Analysis Wizard shows where your money is
   going, so you can manage operations better and identify profitable new
   business strategies.
<P>
</UL><h3>To Look Back</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Compare data across different years, businesses, or even different
   accounting systems to assess performance.

<LI>Monitor financial position with dynamic reports that analyze sales,
   margin, and inventory results. Eliminate doubt about business
   performance over the period.
<P>
</UL><h3>To Look Ahead</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Chart net income and watch it change for different scenarios, giving you
   instant financial feedback about operational decisions.

<LI>Generate interactive what-if reports to forecast the effects of changes
   in product mix, product volume, gross profit margin, sales and marketing
   costs, working capital, and equipment investments. Know what to expect,
   so you can plan ahead.

   Also, Lease Analysis Wizard summarizes lease, buy, or borrow scenarios
   to help you reach the right financing decisions.
