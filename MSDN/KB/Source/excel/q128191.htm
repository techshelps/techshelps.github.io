The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you open a file located on a Novell server, you
may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't access file

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you open a file on a Novell server that has
Macintosh services if the file is open in another instance of Microsoft
Excel. For example, if the file is open in Microsoft Excel on one
workstation, and you open the same file from the network drive in Microsoft
Excel on another workstation, you receive this error message.
<P>
Under these conditions, you should receive a message indicating that the
file is being modified by another user, and you should be allowed to either
open the file as Read-Only, or you should be alerted when the file is
available.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel version 5.0a for the Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
