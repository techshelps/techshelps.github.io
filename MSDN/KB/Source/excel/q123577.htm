<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article, 
if you open a file with a name that contains brackets ("[" and "]"), the 
brackets are converted to parentheses for as long as the file is open in 
Microsoft Excel. This behavior may produce unexpected results when you 
create a link to the file or when you attempt to save it.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel uses brackets to signify a workbook file name in a
reference. For example, in the following formula
<P>
<PRE>   =[TestWorkbook]Sheet1!$A$1

</PRE>the brackets surround the name of the workbook (TestWorkbook). The
remainder of the formula to the left of the exclamation point is the name
of the worksheet in the workbook.
<P>
If you open a file with a name that contains brackets, the brackets are 
converted to parentheses. For example, if you open a file with this name
<P>
<PRE>   This[IsA]Test

</PRE>the filename appears as
<P>
<PRE>   This(IsA)Test

</PRE>in the title bar. Also, if you create a formula in another workbook that
refers to the workbook, the formula resembles the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ='[This(IsA)Test]Sheet1'!$A$1

</PRE>This reference will work as long as the "This[IsA]Test" workbook is open.
However, if the "This[IsA]Test" workbook is closed, the links to that
workbook will not function correctly, because Microsoft Excel will not
recognize the file name.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this type of error, DO NOT use brackets in your workbook file 
names and do not rename Microsoft Excel files in the Finder or File Manager 
so that they contain brackets.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that when you save a new file in Microsoft Excel 5.0, you cannot
include brackets in the file name. The only way that brackets appear
in the file name is if the file was originally created either in an earlier
version of Microsoft Excel or in another program or if the file was
renamed in the Finder or File Manager.
