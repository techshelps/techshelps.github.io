<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Using Symantec DiskLock version 3.5 for PC may cause Microsoft Excel
version 5.0 files which have been locked with DiskLock to become binary
files. When the primary user, who should have rights to open those files,
tries to open them in Microsoft Excel without first unlocking them with
DiskLock, they open as binary text files. If a user logs on to the computer
without the rights to open the files, that user receives the message
<P>
<PRE>   file could not be found

</PRE>and no damage results. Other programs do not need to be unlocked by
DiskLock before they are opened.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Symantec has heard of possible problems with DiskLock for PC and Microsoft
Excel version 5.0. The way an program accesses its files may be the issue.
DiskLock expects this to be done through MS-DOS interrupts and if
this does not happen, the program may have problems.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Unlock any Microsoft Excel files locked with DiskLock before you attempt
to open them. See the "More Information" section.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you use Microsoft Excel 5.0 and Symantec DiskLock
version 3.5.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Symantec suggests preventing accidental attempts to open and
thus damage locked files by using Setup in Norton Disklock
to select "Prevent Direct Disk Access." This prevents all users from
using "DOS direct disk access functions" (DiskLock documentation p.5-
5). "The direct access functions fail when they are tried and a violation
screen is displayed." However files did frequently give a general
protection fault (GPF) in Storage.dll when you try to access them while
they were locked and Prevent Direct Disk Access was either checked OR
unchecked. Rebooting after the GPF, unlocking the files and attempting
again to open them shows them to have become binary and the workaround
appears
to fail.

Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
