Summary:
<P>
The following is the contents of the Open EIS Pak for Windows
README.TXT which is located in the EIS subdirectory after you install
the Microsoft Open EIS Pak for Windows. The last section contains
information regarding the files needed for the sample applications
included in the package.
<P>
More Information:
<P>
<P><h3>*** Microsoft Open EIS Pak Version 1.0 README File ***</h3>
 
<P>
This file contains additional information for the Microsoft Open EIS
Pak. The following information is included:
<P>
* Notes on the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder
<P>
<PRE>    - Tips and Techniques Examples
    - Using Online Help
    - Using International Versions of Microsoft Excel
    - Halt Tool Changes
    - Alternate Installation of Run-Time Files
    - Restoring Minimized Applications While Using DDE

</PRE>* Files Included With The Microsoft Open EIS Pak
<P>
<PRE>    - Starting the Sample Applications
    - Default Directories and Files

</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h3>*** Notes on the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder ***</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Tips and Techniques Examples</h3>
 
<P>
To assist EIS developers with creative design techniques, an additional
application has been created. This application may be found in the Examples
directory under the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder directory (the default is
C:\EISPAK\EISBLDR\EXAMPLES).
<P>
This application features online discussion of special techniques used to
create the user interface. To get the most benefit out of this application,
start by loading the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder (AUTHOR.XLA). Once loaded,
open the application by selecting the Open command from the EIS menu, and
select XAMPLS.XLA. (Note: The Queries Help topic indicates that the
examples XLA file is called EXAMPLES.XLA. The correct file name is
XAMPLES.XLA not EXAMPLES.XLA.)
<P>
<P><h3>Using Online Help</h3>
 
<P>
As you begin using the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder, you should spend a few
minutes reviewing EIS Builder Help. Much of the detailed information you
need to know on actions, arguments, dialog box options, settings details,
and other important topics is readily available through the online Help
facility. Whenever the EIS Builder is loaded, Help may be accessed by
choosing the EIS Builder Help command from the Microsoft Excel Help menu.
If you want to access context-sensitive information for a specific dialog
box, click the Help button in that dialog box.
<P>
For step-by-step instructions on using EIS Builder Help, see "Before You
Begin" in the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>Using International Versions of Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
The version of the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder contained on these diskettes
will not work with international versions of Microsoft Excel. If you wish
to use the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder with a version of Microsoft Excel
other than English, please contact your local Microsoft subsidiary.
<P>
Like the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder, the sample applications contained on
these diskettes also require the English language version of Microsoft
Excel.
<P>
<P><h3>Halt Tool Changes</h3>
 
<P>
When you are creating an application with the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder,
you may wish to test the application using the Run command on the EIS Menu.
When the application is being run from within "author mode," a single icon
appears on a Halt tool bar in the upper left corner of the window. By
clicking on this icon, the application being run halts and you are returned
to author mode.
<P>
If the application being run uses the standard Excel menu, the developer
may also return to author mode by choosing the Halt command from the EIS
Menu. The application will then be halted, and the Halt command will change
back to the original Run command.
<P>
Should you wish to hide the toolbar, it may be hidden by clicking in the
upper left corner of the toolbar. In order to return to author mode, you
must either select the EIS Halt command, or enter Ctrl-H.
<P>
<P><h3>Alternate Installation of the Run-Time Files</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft EIS Builder utilizes three run-time files. These files may be
freely copied to users who do not have a licensed copy of the Microsoft
Excel EIS Builder. Such users, however, will require a licensed copy of
Microsoft Excel.
<P>
These files are:
<P>
<P>
<PRE>  Filename      Definition
  -------------------------------------------------------

  EIS.XLA       The main EIS macro

  XTACTION.XLA  The dialog box and functions for crosstab
                tables on EIS Views

  EISUSER.HLP   The Windows Help file for users of an
                application built with the Microsoft Excel
                EIS Builder

</PRE>By default, the Microsoft Open EIS Pak Setup program installs these
files in the C:\EISPAK\EISBLDR directory. The Setup program also
installs EIS.XLA and EISUSER.XLA in the directories used by the EIS
Limited sample application (C:\EISPAK\SAMPLES\EISLTD) and the Tips and
Techniques Example application (C:\EISPAK\EISBLDR\EXAMPLES).
<P>
If instead you wish to have a single copy of these files on your hard
disk, they may be copied to your Excel Library directory (typically
C:\EXCEL\LIBRARY) and deleted from other locations. Files may be
copied using a DOS COPY command or the Windows File Manager. Whenever
a user's EIS application files is opened and these run-time files are
not present in the same directory, the application will automatically
look in the Excel Library directory for these files.
<P>
<P><h3>Moving or Deleting Files</h3>
 
<P>
Should you wish to delete or "uninstall" any of the Open EIS Pak
applications, the files may simply be deleted. The Open EIS Pak files
do not require any changes to *.INI files, however, deletion of files
may result in your being unable to run the software. If this occurs,
simply reinstall the software using the setup program on your
diskettes.
<P>
Should you wish to move any of the Open EIS Pak files to another
location, they may be copied provided that all files in old
directories remain together in the new directories, and that the new
directories adhere to the structure noted in the default file
directory listings later in this document. The only exception to this
pertains to the Run-Time files, described above.
<P>
<P><h3>Restoring A Minimized Application While Using DDE Links</h3>
 
<P>
To use a Perform DDE action, you must activate the application in
which the action is being performed, and restore the application if it
is minimized. The Activate Application action in the Inter-application
action class should be used to activate the application.
<P>
The commands needed to restore an application vary between
applications. In general, use a Perform DDE action which contains the
keystrokes necessary to restore the application. For many windows
applications, an operation of % r (equivalent to Alt - space - r) can
be used.
<P>
 
<P>
<P><h3>*** Files Included with The Microsoft Open EIS Pak ****</h3>
 
<P>
When you run Setup from the Setup disk, all the files you need to run
the sample applications and the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder are
copied.
<P>
To save space on the disks, many files shipped with Microsoft Open EIS
Pak are compressed. Compressed files are identified by a "_" in the
file extension. These files cannot be used directly with Microsoft
Windows or Microsoft applications; they must be decompressed before
use. When you run Setup from the Setup disk, these files are
automatically decompressed.
<P>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Starting the Sample Applications</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Open EIS Pak diskettes contain four sample EIS
applications. A set of application profiles is included in the Pak.
These profiles provide important information on the design
considerations and unique aspects of each demo, as well as start-up
information. All of these sample applications require Microsoft Excel
4.0 or later. In order to ensure that the sample applications work
properly, check to see that the directory containing Microsoft Excel
is included in your DOS path. The DOS path is typically included in
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If you are using Microsoft Word for Windows or
Microsoft Project for Windows, the subdirectories containing these
applications also need to be included in the DOS path.
