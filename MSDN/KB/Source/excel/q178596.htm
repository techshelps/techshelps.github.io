The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, you may notice one or
more of the following problems:

<UL><LI>When you start Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, you receive one
   of the following error messages:
<P>
<P><PRE>      There is insufficient memory to launch Microsoft Excel.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      There is not enough memory to load the Microsoft Office 98
      Microsoft Object Transport shared library.
</PRE>
<LI>If you click the Tools menu, point to Macro, and click Visual Basic
   Editor, or if you press OPTION+F11, you may receive one or more of the
   following error messages:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Not enough memory to run; quitting
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot use object linking and embedding.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      One of your object libraries (Standard OLE Types (PowerMac)) is
      missing or damaged. Please install the program again.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      An error occurred initializing the VBA libraries (8)
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      'VBA Extensibility Library (1)' could not be loaded.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Out of memory
</PRE><P>
   The computer may stop responding (hang).

<LI>If you attempt to insert a UserForm into a workbook in the Visual
   Basic Editor, the UserForm appears, but it is incomplete. As a result,
   you cannot insert controls into the UserForm.

<LI>When you click the Search button on the Object Browser in the Visual
   Basic Editor, the computer stops responding (hangs).

<LI>When you quit Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, you receive the
   following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Visual Basic
      Error accessing the system registry
</PRE><P>
</UL>The smaller the amount of memory installed on your computer, the more
likely it is that these problems may occur.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur when one or more of the following conditions are
true:

<UL><LI>Virtual memory on your computer is turned off.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>In the Info dialog box for Microsoft Excel, the Minimum Size setting is
   too low.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The amount of available memory is very low, either because there are
   too many programs running, or because your computer has insufficient
   total memory (regular memory plus virtual memory).
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you receive any of these error messages, you may need to perform one or
more of the following sets of steps.
<P>
<P><h3>Turn on Virtual Memory</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Apple menu, click Control Panels. Then, double-click the Memory
   control panel.

<P><LI>Select the On option button in the Virtual Memory section.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Close Window. Then, click Restart on the
   Special menu.
<P>
</OL>When the computer restarts, virtual memory is turned on.
<P>
NOTE: If necessary, you can set the amount of virtual memory in the Memory
control panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Change the Minimum Size and Preferred Size of Memory</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In the Finder, select Microsoft Excel in the Microsoft Office 98
   folder.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Get Info.

<P><LI>In the Minimum Size and Preferred Size edit boxes, enter the amount of
   memory you want Microsoft Excel to use.
<P>
   NOTE: Do not set the Minimum Size setting too low. If you do, you will
   receive an error message similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      You have set the Minimum size below &lt;x&gt;K, which may cause "Microsoft
      Excel" to crash. Are you sure you want to continue?
</PRE>
<P><LI>When you are finished, click Close Window on the File menu.
<P>
</OL><h3>Increase Available Memory</h3>
 
<P>
The following are two methods that you can use to increase the amount of
available memory in your computer:

<UL><LI>Upgrade your computer by installing more memory.

<LI>Do not run unnecessary programs or extensions. You can disable
   extensions by using the Extensions Manager in the Control Panel;
   however, you should be careful when you disable extensions, because
   some extensions need to be loaded in order for some programs to work
   correctly.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is strongly recommended that you turn virtual memory on if you are
running Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition on your computer. If you turn
virtual memory off, you will likely need to increase the amount of memory
available to Microsoft Excel by performing the steps shown in the
"Resolution" section.
<P>
