                      Questions and Answers: Upgrade
               --------------------------------------------

1. Q. How do I upgrade from Excel for Windows version 3.0 or earlier to
      Excel for Windows version 4.0?

   A. To order your Excel for Windows version 4.0 upgrade, please call
      the Microsoft Sales and Information Center at (800) 426-9400,
      select End User Sales and Service, and request information on upgrade
      procedures. The End User Sales office is open from 6:30 A.M. to
      5:30 P.M. Pacific time.

2. Q. What are the minimum hardware and software requirements for Excel
      for Windows version 4.0?

   A. To run Excel for Windows version 4.0 you will need the following:

      -  An industry standard architecture (ISA) computer such as an IBM
         PC/AT or compatible, or a micro channel architecture (MCA)
         computer, such as an IBM Personal System/2 or compatible.
      -  2 megabytes of RAM memory.
      -  MS-DOS or PC-DOS version 3.1 or later and Microsoft Windows
         graphical environment, version 3.0 or later, running in standard
         or 386 enhanced mode.
      -  A graphics card compatible with Microsoft Windows version 3.0,
         such as IBM VGA, EGA, or Hercules graphics card.
      -  A 3.5-inch, 1.44 megabyte or 5.25-inch, 1.2 megabyte floppy disk
         drive and a hard disk with at least 5 megabytes of free disk
         space.
      -  A mouse is optional but highly recommended. Some Microsoft Excel
         version 4.0 features require a mouse.

3. Q. What features are new to Microsoft Excel for Windows version 4.0?

   A. Microsoft Excel version 4.0 gives you unprecedented power and ease
      of use. It enables you to have instant access to powerful features
      including unmatched analytical functions, outstanding reporting and
      presentation tools, and extensive easy charting. The new features
      of Microsoft Excel version 4.0 for Windows are described in more
      detail below:

      -  Drag and Drop is a fast and easy way to cut, copy, and paste
         data using the mouse. Just point to what you want to move and
         drag it to where you want it.
      -  Shortcut menus, another new feature, pop up when you click the
         right mouse button. They give you instant access to common
         context-sensitive commands.
      -  AutoFill recognizes trends and intelligently extends data and
         alphanumeric headings as far as you'd like.
      -  AutoFormat applies an attractive professionally designed format
         to your worksheet with just one mouse click.

      Microsoft Excel 4.0 has the powerful analysis tools you asked for:

      -  Scenario Manager is the best "what if" tool around. It lets you
         easily create and save multiple "what if" scenarios and create a
         summary of those scenarios.
      -  The Analysis ToolPak includes the most extensive financial,
         statistical, engineering, and scientific functions of any
         spreadsheet, with over 160 functions in all.

      Excel 4.0 has all this plus great presentation and graphics tools:

      -  The spelling checker is a built-in feature that makes all of
         your presentations letter perfect.
      -  Report Manager lets you define different areas of one or more
         worksheets and print them as one report.
      -  Also, our gallery of 90 chart types has been enhanced to include
         rotating 3-D, surface, and radar charts.

      Excel 4.0 also provides a smooth transition from Lotus 1-2-3:

      -  The Macro Interpreter for Lotus 1-2-3 users lets you run Lotus
         1-2-3 macros unmodified (all release 2.01, and most release 2.2
         and 2.3 macros).
      -  Full File compatibility means that Microsoft Excel reads 19
         different file formats including WKS, WK1, WK3, and Impress.

4. Q. I am a Microsoft Excel developer. Does Microsoft provide any
      special programs for professional Excel developers?

      Microsoft will be releasing a Software Development Kit (SDK) for
      Microsoft Excel version 4.0. You can obtain preliminary materials
      on the new Excel C application programming interface and the
      Microsoft Excel file formats, which will be part of this SDK,
      by calling the End User Sales office at (800) 227-4679. Ask to speak
      with a member of the Microsoft Developer Services Team. The End User
      Sales office is open from 6:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Pacific time.
