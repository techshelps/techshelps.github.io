The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you move a cell (by using the drag-and-drop feature or by using the Cut
and Paste commands) in a shared workbook, the contents of the moved cell
may be lost when you immediately save the shared workbook. This may occur
even when you move the cell to a location that is not used for all users of
the shared workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior will occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The shared workbook is opened by you and another user.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>Another user clears the contents of a cell (points to Clear on the
   Edit menu and clicks Contents) and saves the shared workbook.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You move the same cell (by using the drag-and-drop feature or by using
   the Edit and Paste commands) that was cleared by the other user and save
   the shared workbook.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the Copy and Paste commands to make a copy of the contents of the cell.
You can clear the contents of the original cell. With the original cell
selected, point to Clear on the Edit menu and click Contents to clear the
contents of the original cell.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a shared workbook, Microsoft Excel will update the changes
from the last save on the shared workbook first and then save your changes.
If a cell is cleared in the previous save and you moved that same cell, the
cleared cell is moved to the new location.
<P>
