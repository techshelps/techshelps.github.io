SUMMARY
 
<P>
This article contains Troubleshooting information for AccessLinks. If you
are having problems using AccessLinks in Microsoft Excel, follow the
corresponding steps in this article. Be sure that Microsoft Excel is
running in the background when you follow these steps.
<P>
<P><h3>Memory Issues</h3>
 
<P>
One potential problem that may occur with AccessLinks is a memory limit.
Microsoft Access requires 12 megabytes (MB) and Microsoft Excel requires 8
MB. You need to have a minimum of 16 MB to use AccessLinks; 20 MB is
recommended. If your computer does not have enough memory, the conversion
to Microsoft Access and the creation of forms and reports may be slow.
<P>
<P><h3>Access Form</h3>
 
<P>
The Access Form option (On the Data menu) essentially starts the Microsoft
Access Simple Form Wizard. If you are having problems using the Access Form
option in Microsoft Excel, you can start the Microsoft Access Simple Form
Wizard from Microsoft Access.
<P>
To start the Microsoft Access Simple Form Wizard, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open Microsoft Access and the sample database Northwind, which can be
   found in the Samples folder of the Microsoft Access folder.

<P><LI>Create a link to a Microsoft Excel worksheet by pointing to Get External
   Data on the File menu, and then clicking Link Tables. Then, select
   Microsoft Excel (*.xls) under File Type, select a Microsoft Excel
   worksheet, and click the Link button.

<P><LI>Follow the steps in the Link Spreadsheet Wizard.

<P><LI>Click the Forms tab in the Database windows, and then click the New
   button.

<P><LI>Select Form Wizard from the list, and then click OK. Follow the steps in
   the Form Wizard.
<P>
</OL>From this point forward, if there is a problem it is probably an error in
the steps taken within the wizard. Known issues are documented in the
Office database of the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
<P>
<P><h3>Access Report</h3>
 
<P>
The Access Report option (On the Data menu) starts the Microsoft Access
Simple Report Wizard. If you are having problems using the Access Report
option in Microsoft Excel, you can start the Microsoft Access Simple Report
Wizard from Microsoft Access.
<P>
To start the Microsoft Access Simple Report Wizard:

<OL><P><LI>Open Microsoft Access and the sample database Northwind, which can be
   found in the Samples folder of the Microsoft Access folder.

<P><LI>Create a link to a Microsoft Excel worksheet by pointing to Get External
   Data on the File menu, and then clicking Link Tables. Then, select
   Microsoft Excel (*.xls) under File Type, select a Microsoft Excel
   worksheet, and click the Link button.

<P><LI>Follow the steps in the Link Spreadsheet Wizard.

<P><LI>Click the Reports tab in the Database window, and then click the New
   button.

<P><LI>Select Report Wizard from the list, and then click OK. Follow the steps
   in the Report Wizard.
<P>
</OL>From this point forward, if there is a problem it is probably an error in
the steps taken within the wizard. Known issues are documented in the
Office database of the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
<P>
<P><h3>Convert to Access</h3>
 
<P>
The Convert to Access option (On the Data menu)starts the Microsoft Access
Import Spreadsheet Wizard. If you are having problems using the Convert to
Access menu option in Microsoft Excel, you can start the Microsoft Access
Import Spreadsheet Wizard from Microsoft Access.
<P>
To start the Microsoft Access Import Spreadsheet Wizard:

<OL><P><LI>Open Microsoft Access and the sample database Northwind, which can be
   found in the Samples folder of the Microsoft Access folder.

<P><LI>On the File menu, point to Get External Data, and then click Import.

<P><LI>Under Files Of Type, select Microsoft Excel, and select the closed
   Microsoft Excel file that you are trying to convert. Click the Import
   button.

<P><LI>Follow the steps in the Import Spreadsheet Wizard.
<P>
</OL>From this point forward, if there is a problem it is probably an error in
the steps taken within the wizard. Known issues are documented in the
Office database of the Knowledge Base.
<P>
If the engineer or customer suspects problems with the spreadsheet ISAM,
follow the troubleshooting steps above. If similar problem occur in
standalone Microsoft Access this would be a live-transfer to an Access
engineer.
