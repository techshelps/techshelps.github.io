<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c, 7.0
<LI>Microsoft LAN Manager for UNIX
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, you cannot create a reference to a file
located on a LAN Manager for UNIX (LMX) network server.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Because you cannot create a reference to a file located on an LMX network
server, you must first copy the desired files to either of the following:

<UL><LI>A local drive
<P>
   -or-

<LI>A network server that is connected by network software other than LMX
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel allows you to create references to libraries or workbooks
so that your macros and subroutines can access functions built into those
files. To create a reference to an external file from the current workbook,
do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Activate a Visual Basic module in the active workbook.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click References.

<P><LI>In the References dialog, do either of the following:
<P>
   - Click the check box next to a library file or workbook that
<P><PRE>     is already open.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE><P>
   - click Browse to create a reference to a file that is
<P><PRE>     not currently open and that is not already referenced.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK to accept the changes when you are finished creating
   references.
<P>
</OL>If you attempt to create a reference to a file located on an LMX
network server, you will receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   File not found

   -or-

   Cannot find '&lt;Filename&gt;'

</PRE></OL>These error message occur because Microsoft Excel cannot recognize the
filename due to the naming conventions used by the LMX network. A typical
LMX server name might be "\\attunix.serve\testing" (without the quotation
marks).
<P>
Note the long (five character) filename extension after "attunix" in the
server name.
<P>
Microsoft Excel cannot connect properly to servers that use this type of
Name; it is not MS-DOS compatible, nor does it fully comply with the
Universal Naming Convention (UNC) used by LAN Manager and other
network operating systems.
