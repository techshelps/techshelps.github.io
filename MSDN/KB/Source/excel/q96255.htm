<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0 and 4.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if the print area of your document contains 592 or
more rows and if the Fit To option (under Scaling in the Page Setup
dialog box) is set to a number of Pages Wide By to reduce the page
width, your worksheet may be scaled down 10-percent and the document
will be printed and displayed in print preview as a few pages of
unreadable, compressed print. This scaling problem occurs if you
specify a number of pages Tall in the Fit To option.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Microsoft
Excel listed above. This problem does not occur in later versions of
Microsoft Excel for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the Page Setup dialog box, under Scaling, you have two available
options:
<P>
<PRE>   Reduce/Enlarge To - this option allows you to specify a percentage
   for reducing or enlarging a document.

   -and-

   Fit To - this option allows you to compress your document to fit on
   a specified number of pages. For example, if the range you are
   printing is 4 pages wide when the scaling is 100-percent and it
   contains 600 rows, setting the Fit To option to 3 Pages Wide By 30
   Tall will cause the whole sheet to be scaled 10-percent. This
   occurs even though at 100-percent scaling the 600 rows easily fit
   on fewer than 30 pages.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>If you don't need to reduce your document lengthwise, leave the
   number of pages Tall box blank in the Fit To option.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>If you need to reduce the width AND the length of your document,
   use the Reduce/Enlarge To option rather than the Fit To option.
   Since Reduce/Enlarge To requires you to type a specific number, you
   may need to experiment to determine the percentage by which you
   need to reduce all of your columns and rows so that they will fit
   onto the desired number of pages. To experiment with different
   percentages, do the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. From the File menu, choose Print Preview.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. In print preview, choose the Setup button to open the Page Setup
       dialog box.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    3. Under Scaling, type the percentage by which you want to reduce
       your document. For example, if you want the document to be
       25-percent smaller than normal, type "75" (without the quotation
       marks) in the Reduce/Enlarge To box.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    4. Choose the OK button to return to the Print Preview screen.
</PRE><P>
   To increase or decrease the percentage by which you want to
   increase or decrease your document, repeat steps 2-4.
