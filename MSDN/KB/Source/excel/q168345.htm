</PRE><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 
<P>
The Internet Assistant Wizard Add-In program provides
enhanced capabilities for the Microsoft Excel 97 Internet
Assistant Wizard, including programmatic conversion of data
and charts to HTML. The upgraded features of this add-in are
as follows:

<UL><LI>Improved conversion of filtered lists
<P>
   When you convert a range filtered with AutoFilter to
   HTML, the entire list is converted with the filtered
   state of the list maintained. This conversion is done
   automatically; there are no changes to the operation of
   the Internet Assistant Wizard. All filtering options are
   converted except the Custom option; if the range has a
   custom AutoFilter in place, the resulting HTML displays
   the entire unfiltered list.
<P>
   If you subsequently use Microsoft Excel to open a
   converted HTML file that includes a list that was
   filtered with AutoFilter, the entire list is restored,
   with the AutoFilter arrows in place.

<LI>HTMLconvert function for automating conversions.
<P>
   You can use this custom function in Visual Basic for
   Applications to write programs that automatically convert
   worksheet data and charts to HTML. HTMLconvert automates
   all of the capabilities provided by the Internet
   Assistant Wizard. For reference information, see the
   section "HTMLconvert Function Documentation" in this
   readme file.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>
 
<P>
The Internet Assistant Wizard Add-In requires Microsoft
Excel 97. The add-in will not work with earlier versions of
Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>INSTALLING THE INTERNET ASSISTANT WIZARD ADD-IN</h2>
 
<P>
The add-in program includes one add-in file, Html.xla, and
this readme file. To install the Internet Assistant Wizard
Add-In:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Add-Ins.

<P><LI>Make sure Internet Assistant Wizard is selected. If you
   don't see this add-in listed, click Browse, and use the
   Browse dialog box to locate and select Html.xla. In the
   Add-Ins dialog box, click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>USING THE INTERNET ASSISTANT WIZARD ADD-IN</h2>
 
<P>
Once installed, you can convert worksheet data and charts to
HTML in either of two ways:

<UL><LI>You can run the Internet Assistant Wizard by clicking
   Save As HTML on the File menu.

<LI>You can use the HTMLconvert function in Visual Basic for
   Applications to perform conversions.
<P>
</UL>In both cases your filtered lists filtered with AutoFilter
are automatically converted in the filtered state, and if
you open the resulting HTML file in Microsoft Excel, the
full list is converted back to Microsoft Excel format with
the filtering intact.
<P>
<P><h2>HTMLCONVERT FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION</h2>
 
<P>
This custom function converts worksheet data and charts to
HTML and then returns an integer constant that indicates
either a successful conversion or the reason for its
failure.
<P>
To use this function, the Html.xla file must be loaded into
memory, either programmatically or by invoking and then
canceling the Internet Assistant Wizard. The Html.xla file
also must be referenced (Tools menu, References command).
<P>

</PRE><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
The following example passes an array, Objects, describing
two ranges of data and a chart to be converted. It creates a
new HTML file named MyPage.htm. The file is intended for
display on a U.S. Windows system. The page will have the
header "My Worksheet Data" followed by a horizontal rule and
the converted data. The bottom the page will have the
current date as the time of last update, "MyName" as the
author, and "MyMail@microsoft.com" as the e-mail address.
