The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you save a shared workbook, you may receive one of
the following error messages
<P>
<PRE>   This file has been locked by &lt;user name&gt; for saving. Please try again
   later.

</PRE>where &lt;user name&gt; is the name of another user who has the file open for
editing.
<P>
<PRE> -or-

   Document saved as '&lt;numchar&gt;'. Cannot rename to '&lt;filename&gt;'. You must
   close this document.

</PRE>where &lt;numchar&gt; is a combination of numbers and characters such as
0ae06000 and &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file you are saving, such as
Book1.xls.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you save a shared workbook while another user is
also saving the same file. This behavior occurs because the workbook is
locked during the save process and cannot be saved by another user until
the save process is complete. This behavior is by design of Microsoft
Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, wait a few minutes (depending on the size of
the file) until the save process is complete, and then try saving the file
again.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This error message may appear when you save a file immediately after
another user saves the same file. When you save a Microsoft Excel workbook
file, the following process occurs:

<UL><LI>The original file (for example, Book1.xls) is locked.
<LI>The original file is saved to a temporary file (0ae06000).
<LI>The original file (Book1.xls) is unlocked.
<LI>The original file (Book1.xls) is deleted.
<LI>The temporary file (0ae06000) is renamed to the original file name
   (Book1.xls).
<P>
</UL>If you save a shared workbook while it is being saved by another user, you
receive the error message in the "Symptoms" section in this article. This
problem occurs when your save process begins AFTER the file is deleted and
BEFORE it is renamed (by the first save process) or when the save process
you initiated locks the file after it is unlocked (by the first save
process). It is unlikely that you will receive the second error message; it
appears only in the case when two save processes for one file begin almost
at the same moment.
