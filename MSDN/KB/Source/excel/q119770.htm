<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you specify a number in the Start Import At Row box
in the Text Import Wizard, and the beginning row number that you specify is
a value greater than 32767, you may receive the following error message.
<P>
<PRE>   In Microsoft Excel versions 5.x and 7.x:

      Number is not valid.

   In Microsoft Excel 97:

      Your entry cannot be used. An integer or decimal number may be
      required.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow the appropriate procedure below for
your version of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h3>Versions 5.x and 7.x -- Importing Text Files with Fewer than 49,151 Rows</h3>
 
<P>
The maximum number of rows in a Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0 worksheet is
16,384. If you open a text file with 16,384 rows or fewer, all rows of the
text file will be imported into one worksheet. However, if you attempt to
import more rows in a text file than are available in the worksheet, only
16,384 rows of the text file will be loaded, and you will receive the
following error:
<P>
<PRE>     File Not Loaded Completely

</PRE>If your worksheet contains more than 16,384 but fewer than 49,151 rows,
you can use the Text Import Wizard to import the text file into multiple
worksheets using the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Open on the File menu, select the text file to open, and click OK.

<P><LI>In the Text Import Wizard, select 1 for "Start Import at Row" and click
   Finish.

<P><LI>The first 16,384 rows of the text file are imported into a worksheet,
   and you receive the error "File Not Loaded Completely." Click OK. Save
   this workbook.

<P><LI>Repeat step 1. In the Text Import Wizard, select 16385 for "Start Import
   at Row," and click Finish.

<P><LI>The next 16,384 rows of the text file are imported into a worksheet, and
   you receive the error "File Not Loaded Completely" (if the text file
   contains more than 32,768 rows). Click OK. Save this workbook.

<P><LI>Repeat step 1. In the Text Import Wizard select 32767 for "Start Import
   at Row," and click Finish.

<P><LI>The last 16,384 rows of the text file are imported into a worksheet.

<P><LI>You can delete the first two rows in this workbook because these rows
   were also imported into the workbook you saved in step 5. Save this
   workbook.
<P>
</OL><h3>Version 97 -- Importing Text Files with Fewer than 98,303 Rows</h3>
 
<P>
The maximum number of rows in a Microsoft Excel 97 worksheet is 65,536. If
you open a text file with 65,536 rows or fewer, all rows of the text file
will be imported into one worksheet. However, if you attempt to import more
rows in a text file than are available in the worksheet, only 65,536 rows
of the text file will be loaded, and you will receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>     File Not Loaded Completely

</PRE></OL>If your worksheet contains more than 65,536 but fewer than 98,303 rows,
you can use the Text Import Wizard to import the text file into multiple
worksheets using the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Open on the File menu, select the text file to open, and click OK.

<P><LI>In the Text Import Wizard, select 1 for "Start Import at Row," and click
   Finish.

<P><LI>The first 65,536 rows of the text file are imported into a worksheet,
   and you receive the error "File Not Loaded Completely". Click OK. Save
   this workbook.

<P><LI>Repeat step 1. In the Text Import Wizard, select 32767 for "Start Import
   at Row," and click Finish.

<P><LI>Note that 65,536 rows of the text file starting at row 32766 are
   imported into a worksheet. Save this workbook.

<P><LI>You can delete the first 32,770 rows in this workbook because these rows
   were also imported into the workbook you saved in step 5. Save this
   workbook.
<P>
</OL><h3>Importing Larger Text Files</h3>
 
<P>
If your text file is too large to import using the Text Import Wizard as
described earlier, you will need to create a macro to import your text file
that determines the size of the text file and breaks it up into individual
worksheets.
<P>
For an example of a Visual Basic for Applications macro that accomplishes
this, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
