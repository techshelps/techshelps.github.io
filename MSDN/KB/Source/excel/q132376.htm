The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Macintosh, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to open a file that is located on another Macintosh
computer over a network, you may receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot access &lt;file name&gt;

   -or-

   Cannot find &lt;file name&gt;

   -or-

   &lt;file name&gt; cannot be accessed. The file may be read-only, or you
   may be trying to access a read-only location. Or, the server the
   document is stored on may not be responding

</PRE>where &lt;file name&gt; is the name of the file you are attempting to open.
<P>
It is also possible for the system to load a local copy of the requested
file if such a file exists at the same location on the local hard disk.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when your hard disk and the remote hard disk have the
same name and the entire remote hard disk has been shared.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, use either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Rename one of the two hard disks to allow access to the file on the remote
disk.
<P>
Renaming a Macintosh Hard Disk:
<P>
From the Macintosh containing the disk disk to be renamed, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the drive icon.

<P><LI>Click the name below the disk icon.

<P><LI>When the pointer changes into an I-beam, click to the immediate right of
   the last letter in the drive name.

<P><LI>Press DELETE once for each character and space in the drive name.

<P><LI>Type the new name.

<P><LI>Press RETURN.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Share only the folders to be accessed by other users, not the entire hard
disk. Besides the additional security gained, it is less likely that a
remote user will connect with a local disk that has the same name as the
shared folder.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The default hard disk name used by Apple is "Macintosh HD." Many users
change this name to make it easier for other users to identify the
hard disks available over the network.
<P>
When users do not change the hard disk name and attempt to access a file on
an identically named disk, the operating system cannot distinguish between
the local disk and the remote disk. This causes the system to look for the
file on the local disk. If it does not find a file of that name on the
local disk, it returns the message listed above. If a local file by that
name does exist in the same folder as the remote file, the system will
return the local file without any message.
