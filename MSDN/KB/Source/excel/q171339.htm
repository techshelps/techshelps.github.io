The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, formulas in a worksheet that refer to other cells
that also contain formulas may not be recalculated properly when the
referenced cells change. As a result, the worksheet may contain values that
are not updated.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when all of the following conditions are
true:

<UL><LI>You are working with a worksheet in which a range of 18 or more cells
   are in the same row.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>Each of these cells contains a formula that refers to the cell
   directly to the left.
<P>
   For example, cell B33 refers to cell A33, cell C33 refers to cell B33,
   cell D33 refers to cell C33, and so on.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The range of cells is in a row with a row number that is a multiple of
   16 plus 1.
<P>
   For example, row 17 is divisible by 16 with a remainder of 1, as are
   rows 33, 49, 65, and so on.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>A formula in a different cell refers to one of the cells in the range.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>A formula in any cell refers to any cell above the range of 18 or more
   cells.
<P>
</UL>For an example of this problem, see the "More Information" section in this
article.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without
warranty either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose. This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming
language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality
of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to contact
the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about the support options available from Microsoft, please see
the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/default.asp</A></B>

</PRE>To resolve this problem, download the Excel 97 Auto Recalculation Patch
from the Microsoft Web site.
<P>
For information about downloading and installing this patch,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q174868.htm">Q174868</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL97: How to Obtain the Excel 97 Auto Recalculation Patch

</PRE>Or, go to the following Microsoft World Wide Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/office/excel/enhancements/xl8p1.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/office/excel/enhancements/xl8p1.asp</A></B>

</PRE>To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Press CTRL+ALT+F9.
<P>
   When you use this key combination, Microsoft Excel completely
   recalculates the values in the worksheet.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Run a Visual Basic for Applications procedure to recalculate
   the values in the worksheet.
<P>
   When you run the following sample Auto_Open procedure, values
   in the active worksheet are recalculated:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Auto_Open()
          Application.SendKeys "^%{F9}"
      End Sub

   NOTE: Do not attempt to use a Worksheet_Activate or a
   Worksheet_Calculate procedure to recalculate the values. If you do this,
   a recursive process begins, and Microsoft Excel 97 performs very slowly.

   For example, do not use the following procedures:

      Private Sub Worksheet_Activate()
          Application.SendKeys "^%{F9}"
      End Sub

      -or-

      Private Sub Worksheet_Calculate()
          Application.SendKeys "^%{F9}"
      End Sub

</PRE></UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Example of the Problem</h3>
 
<P>
To demonstrate the problem described in the "Symptoms" section of this
article, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel 97, create a new workbook.

<P><LI>Select the range D33:U33. Type the following formula
<P>
<P><PRE>      =C33+1
</PRE><P>
   and press CTRL+ENTER.

<P><LI>Select cell A34. Enter the following formula:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =A32
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select cell D34. Enter the following formula:
<P>
<P><PRE>      =D33
</PRE>
<P><LI>Enter any value in cell C33.
<P>
</OL>Note that the value in cell D34, 1, is not recalculated and does not match
the value in cell D33. If you press CTRL+ALT+F9, the formula in D34 is
recalculated correctly.
<P>
NOTE: If this problem occurs, your workbook has not necessarily become
corrupted or damaged. However, if you are concerned about possible workbook
corruption, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
