                       Questions and Answers: Setup
               --------------------------------------------

1. Q. When I try to install Excel version 4.0 for Windows I get an alert
      message telling me Windows needs to be in standard or enhanced
      mode. What am I doing wrong?

   A. Microsoft Excel 4.0 requires Windows version 3.0 to be in either
      standard or enhanced mode. When Windows is not running in standard
      or enhanced mode, the Windows memory manager, HIMEM.SYS, may not be
      present in the CONFIG.SYS file or may not be loading properly for
      some reason.

      The following five-step procedure will help you configure your
      system for proper Windows 3.0 operation:

      a. To install HIMEM.SYS, you first need to know where on your
         system's hard disk the HIMEM.SYS driver is located. If you are
         using MS-DOS version 5.0, use the HIMEM.SYS file located in the
         MS-DOS directory. It will have a file size of 11,552 bytes and a
         file date of 4/9/91. If you are using an MS-DOS version earlier
         than 5.0, use the Windows version of HIMEM.SYS. Windows installs
         this file into the root directory.

         If you can't locate HIMEM.SYS on your system, please contact
         Microsoft Windows technical support at (425) 637-7098.

      b. Start Microsoft Windows. Once Windows has been started, choose
         Run from the File menu in the Program Manager. In the Command Line
         dialog box, type in SYSEDIT. This will start the Microsoft System
         Configuration Editor.

      c. Once SYSEDIT has loaded, you will see four windows titled
         CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT, SYSTEM.INI, and WIN.INI. Choose the
         CONFIG.SYS window by clicking the window title with your mouse
         or by selecting CONFIG.SYS from the Window menu.

      d. Once the CONFIG.SYS file has been selected, if you are using the
         Windows version of HIMEM.SYS, enter the following line at the
         beginning of the file:

                  DEVICE=C:\HIMEM.SYS

         If you are using MS-DOS version 5.0, enter the following line at
         the beginning of the file:

                  DEVICE=C:\MS-DOS\HIMEM.SYS

      e. Save the file by choosing Save from the File menu. Exit the
         System Configuration Editor. Exit Windows and reboot your
         computer.

         Once your computer has rebooted, restart Windows. Confirm that
         Windows 3.0 is running in standard or enhanced mode by selecting
         the Help menu and choosing About Program Manager. If Windows is in
         standard or enhanced mode, you should now be able to install
         Microsoft Excel 4.0. If Windows is still in real mode, please
         contact Microsoft Windows technical support at (425) 637-7098.

2. Q. I need to set up Microsoft Excel version 4.0 for Windows on a
      network server. What is the best way to do this?

   A. Included with Excel 4.0 is a text file that fully details how to
      set up and use Microsoft Excel on a network. The filename is
      NETWORK.TXT. When you install Excel 4.0, a group window is created
      containing, in addition to program icons for Excel, two Notepad
      icons. To view the NETWORK.TXT file, open the corresponding Notepad
      file by double-clicking it or by selecting the icon and choosing Open
      from the File menu.

      If you do not have an icon for the NETWORK.TXT file, follow these
      three steps to open the file in Notepad:

      a. Open the Notepad application located in the Windows Accessories
         Group.

      b. From the File menu, choose Open.

      c. Change to the Excel 4.0 directory and select the NETWORK.TXT
         file from the file list box. Choose the OK button.

3. Q. During Excel for Windows custom installation, I am given the
      opportunity to pick and choose which Excel options I want to
      install. What are each of these options and why should I install
      them?

   A. There are nine options you may choose from during Microsoft Excel
      version 4.0 for Windows setup. A full setup will take approximately
      11 megabytes of disk space. The following is an overview of the
      nine available options:

      Microsoft Excel:
      This option installs the minimum files necessary for using
      Microsoft Excel 4.0. Some of the files are optional; you can choose
      which files to install by selecting the Excel button. If you are
      installing Microsoft Excel 4.0 for the first time, you must turn on
      the Microsoft Excel option.

      Macro Library:
      Selecting this option installs add-in macros that provide enhanced
      functionality in Excel. By choosing the Library button, you may
      choose which of the add-ins you want installed. Examples of these
      add-ins are an Auto Save macro, a flatfile export macro, and a
      Worksheet Auditor macro.

      Microsoft Excel Solver:
      Choosing this option installs Microsoft Excel Solver, an
      easy-to-use companion application that allows you to get more and
      better answers out of the same worksheet you built to ask "what-if"
      questions.

      Analysis ToolPak:
      This option adds financial and engineering functions and provides
      tools for performing statistical and engineering analysis
      procedures.

      Microsoft Excel Tutorial:
      Choosing this option installs a series of online lessons that
      provide an excellent way to interactively learn Microsoft Excel 4.0.

      Examples:
      Selecting this option installs a set of sample worksheets that
      offer ideas on how to combine Microsoft Excel features to create
      powerful worksheets, macros, and models.

      Dialog Editor:
      Choosing this option installs the Dialog Editor application. You
      use the Dialog Editor to create dialog boxes for Microsoft Excel
      command macros as well as custom forms for entering database
      information.

      Macro Translator:
      Choosing this option installs the Macro Translation Assistant, a
      utility that will assist you in translating your Lotus 1-2-3 and
      Microsoft Multiplan macros into Microsoft Excel 4.0 macros.

      Q+E:
      Q+E for Microsoft Excel is an easy-to-use and powerful database
      application that allows you to manipulate and update database files
      from a variety of database systems, including dBASE, Microsoft SQL
      Server, and Oracle.
