<P>
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you use the shared lists feature, by clicking the
Allow Multi-User Editing check box on the Editing tab of the Shared Lists
dialog box, some of the commands and features that you normally use in your
workbook are not available.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because when you share a workbook file, you cannot
use some of the Microsoft Excel features that you normally use. This
behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel because of the way that a shared
file is saved. For example, you cannot change cell formatting in a shared
workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information describes the features and commands that are
not available while you are editing a shared workbook.
<P>
<P><h3>Menu Commands</h3>
 
<P>
The following table contains the menu commands that are unavailable
(grayed) in a shared workbook:
<P>
<PRE>   Menu       Command
   ------------------

   File       Properties

   Edit       Delete Sheet
              Links
              Object

   Insert     Worksheet
              Chart (sub menu items grayed)
              Macro (sub menu items grayed)
              Function
              Name (sub menu items grayed)
              Picture
              Map
              Object

   Format     Cells
              AutoFormat
              Style

   Tools      Scenarios
              Protection (sub menu items grayed)

   Data       Subtotals
              Table
              Group And Outline (sub menu items grayed)
              PivotTable

</PRE><h3>Toolbars</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot use any of the buttons on the following toolbars in a shared
workbook:
<P>
<PRE>   Formatting
   Forms
   Drawing
   Chart

</PRE>On the Standard Toolbar, the following buttons are disabled:
<P>
<PRE>   AutoSum
   Function Wizard
   ChartWizard
   Map
   Format Painter

</PRE><h3>Formulas</h3>
 
<P>
When you enter a formula on a worksheet in a shared workbook, you receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   New or copied formulas won't be saved while the file is being shared.
   Show this message in the future?

</PRE><h3>Objects</h3>
 
<P>
You can't select any objects on a worksheet in a shared workbook. This
includes OLE objects, drawing objects and dialog controls.
<P>
<P><h3>Visual Basic Modules</h3>
 
<P>
When you share a workbook that contains a Visual Basic module, you
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot edit VBA modules in shared mode

</PRE>You can select a Visual Basic module in your shared workbook. However, if
you attempt to edit a procedure in the module, you receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't edit module

</PRE>Note however that you CAN run a macro on a module sheet in a shared
workbook.
<P>
<P><h3>Record New Macro</h3>
 
<P>
If you record a new macro in a shared workbook, the macro is recorded in
a new workbook. In the Record New Macro dialog box, the "New Workbook"
option under Store In is selected by default. The "This Workbook" option
under Store In is unavailable in a shared workbook.
<P>
<P><h3>Chart Sheet or Dialog Sheet</h3>
 
<P>
Although you can select a chart sheet or dialog sheet in a shared
workbook, you cannot select any of the items on the chart or custom dialog
box.
<P>
<P><h3>Macro Sheet</h3>
 
<P>
You can select a macro sheet in a shared workbook. However, because
commands on a macro sheet generally begin with an equal sign (=) (as when
you enter a formula), you receive the error message listed above in the
Formulas section. Note, however, that you CAN run a macro from a macro
sheet in a shared workbook.
