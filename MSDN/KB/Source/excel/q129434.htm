<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Power Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article,
if you open a workbook that contains an Auto_Open subroutine that contains
the following line of code
<P>
<PRE>   Application.Quit

</PRE>Microsoft Excel may stop responding (hang) with either a type 1 error or a
type 11 error, depending on whether you are running Microsoft Excel for the
Macintosh or Microsoft Excel for the Power Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Do not use Application.Quit in the Auto_Open subroutine
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Instead of using a single Auto_Open subroutine, include an
   Application.OnTime command in your Auto_Open subroutine. This command
   should be set up in such a way that it executes another subroutine after
   the Auto_Open subroutine has completed execution. This other subroutine
   contains the Application.Quit command.
<P>
<P><PRE>      For example, instead of using this
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Sub Auto_Open()
             MsgBox "This is a test."
             Application.Quit
         End Sub

      use this:

         Sub Auto_Open()
             Application.OnTime Now + TimeValue("00:00:02"), "QuitMSExcel"
         End Sub

         Sub QuitMSExcel()
             MsgBox "This is a test."
             Application.Quit
         End Sub

   Using Application.OnTime to indirectly call the subroutine containing
   Application.Quit allows you to avoid hanging your computer. If the
   Auto_Open subroutine contains Application.Quit, or if the Auto_Open
   subroutine directly executes a macro that contains the Application.Quit
   command, your computer will hang.

</PRE></UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>

<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/</A></B>

</PRE>The following is an example of an Auto_Open subroutine that will cause
Microsoft Excel 5.0 to hang when the workbook that contains it is opened:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Auto_Open()
       Application.Quit
   End Sub

</PRE>If you open a workbook that contains this subroutine, you will receive one
of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   The application "unknown" has unexpectedly quit, because an error of
   type 1 occurred.

   -or-

   Sorry, a system error occurred.
   "Microsoft Excel"
      error type 11

</PRE>and the computer will either restart or hang when you select the Restart
button.
<P>
This error will not occur unless the subroutine is an Auto_Open subroutine.
For example, when you run the following subroutine
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()
       Application.Quit
   End Sub

</PRE>an error will not occur unless the Test subroutine is directly called by
an Auto_Open subroutine.
<P>
