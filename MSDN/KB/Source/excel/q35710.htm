The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows versions 2.x, 3.0 and 4.0

<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh versions 2.x, 3.0 and 4.0

Because of the differences in disk formats between the PC
(IBM-compatible) and Macintosh, there is no way to use a Macintosh
formatted disk in an IBM or IBM-compatible computer. However, there
are devices on the market that are designed to aid you in transferring
files. A Daynafile is an example of an  MS-DOS formatted disk drive
that you can plug into your Macintosh.  This allows you to copy
information directly from a Macintosh onto an MS-DOS formatted disk.
This disk can then be used in an  IBM-compatible computer.
<P>
File transferring can also be accomplished using Macintosh and PC
communication programs. This is done through modems connected to each
machine. To maintain file integrity, the file should be sent using an
error-correcting protocol such as XMODEM or YMODEM.
<P>
The third method of transferring files is through the Tops network,
which must be installed on both the Macintosh and PC computers. This
method of file transferring allows you to simulate a Macintosh disk on
the PC or a PC disk on the Macintosh.
<P>
Once a method of transferring files has been found, you must do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Save the file from Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh by choosing
   Save As from the File menu and selecting the WK1 format option
   (use WKS if you are using an version of Lotus 1-2-3 prior to 2.0).

<P><LI>Transfer these files using one of the methods discussed earlier.
   These files should then open into Lotus 1-2-3 as if they were
   saved normally from Lotus 1-2-3.
