<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Several considerations must be made in Visual Basic for Applications before
you save a project as an add-in (*.xla). An add-in is a fully compiled
version of a Microsoft Excel workbook, and in many instances an add-in
serves as an appropriate vehicle for distributing Microsoft Excel
applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before you create an add-in, do the following to the workbook that you are
going to use to create it:

<OL><P><LI>Remove any unused or extraneous worksheets, module sheets, dialog
   sheets, charts, and chart sheets.

<P><LI>In macros in the workbook, avoid references to "ActiveWorkbook" when you
   want to refer to the workbook that contains the macro. ActiveWorkbook
   refers to whichever workbook is active. Use "ThisWorkbook" to refer to
   the  workbook in which the VB module resides. An add-in can never be
   active; although it can be loaded into memory, it remains hidden from
   view.

<P><LI>Because add-ins cannot be edited, it is very important to keep a copy of
   your original workbook so that you can update procedures or create new
   procedures.

<P><LI>Certain problems arise when you save a Visual Basic for Applications
   project with a reference to an add-in. For example, Microsoft Excel
   "hard codes" the path of the .xla file when the reference is established
   and the file that contains the reference is saved. The relevant add-in
   must be saved either in the same directory (or folder) as the Microsoft
   Excel file that contains the reference or in a directory in the
   established path on your computer.
