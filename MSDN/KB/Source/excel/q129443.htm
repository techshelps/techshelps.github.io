The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if the Conflict Resolution dialog box appears when you
save changes to a shared file while another user is making changes to the
same file, when you click the "Use These Changes" button, the value that is
entered in the conflicting cell may not be the value that was displayed in
the Conflicting Changes By box as expected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because the "Conflicting Changes By" box in the
Conflict Resolution dialog box may not display the "current" value that is
contained in the conflicting cell on the worksheet that the other user is
modifying. The value displayed in the "Conflicting Changes By" box is the
value that is contained in the conflicting cell when the conflict first
occurs. This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel so that you are not
prompted multiple times for changes in the same conflicting cell.
<P>
Although only the first conflicting change is displayed in the "Conflicting
Changes By" box, when you choose to use the changes to the cell, the value
that is entered in the conflicting cell is the current value that is
contained in that cell on the worksheet that the other user is modifying.
<P>
For example, consider User1 and User2 who are both editing Sheet1 in the
shared file BOOK1. If User1 enters the value "1/2/1995" in cell A1, and
saves the file, and then changes the value in cell A1 to "January" and
saves the file, when User2 enters a value in cell A1 and saves the file,
the Conflict Resolution dialog box appears as expected. However, the
"Conflicting Changes By User1" box contains the original value "1/2/1995"
instead of the current value "January." If User1 clicks the "Use These
Changes" button, the current value "January" is entered in cell A1 as
expected.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that when you click the "Use These Changes" button, a dialog box is
displayed with the following information:
<P>
<PRE>   Save resulted in some changes from other users
