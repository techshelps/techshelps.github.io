The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you use the DOCUMENTS() or the WINDOWS() macro
function to return a list of open documents or document windows, the
filename XL5GALRY.XLS is returned in this list.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you have used the Options dialog box in the current
session of Microsoft Excel. When you choose Options from the Tools menu,
the file XL5GALRY.XLS is opened as a hidden file to access information
about your default chart format. This file is not listed on the Window
menu, and you cannot unhide this file. However, when you use the DOCUMENTS
or the WINDOWS macro functions, the filename is returned as one of the
currently open files or windows. The XL5GALRY.XLS file is located in your
XLSTART directory.
<P>
This behavior may cause a macro error, or unexpected macro results if
your macro uses all of the returned filenames to manipulate each of
the open files or windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid returning XL5GALRY.XLS when you return a list of open documents,
or open windows using a macro, use the Workbooks collection or the Windows
collection in a Visual Basic procedure. The following are examples of using
these methods:
<P>

Microsoft does not support modifications of this procedure to suit customer
requirements for a particular purpose. Note that a line that is preceded by
an apostrophe introduces a comment in the code--comments are provided to
explain what the code is doing at a particular point in the procedure. Note
also that an underscore character (_) indicates that code continues from
one line to the next. You can type lines that contain this character as one
logical line or you can divide the lines of code and include the line
continuation character. For more information about Visual Basic for
Applications programming style, see the "Programming Style in This Manual"
section in the "Document Conventions" section of the "Visual Basic User's
Guide."
<P>
<P><h3>Workbooks Collection</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   ' Dimension wb as object type
   Dim wb as Object
   For each wb in Workbooks
      ' loop through each open Workbook and
      ' display the name in a message box
      MsgBox wb.Name
   Next

</PRE><h3>Windows Collection</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   ' Dimension w as object type
   Dim w as Object
   ' loop through each window on the Window menu and
   ' display the name in a message box
   For each w in Windows
      MsgBox w.caption
   Next

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel for Windows version 5.0c.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the DOCUMENTS() function on a macro sheet to return the
names of open workbooks to use in other functions that manipulate
open workbooks. Similarly, you can use the WINDOWS() macro function to
return a list of active windows to use with other macro functions to
manipulate windows. The names returned by both of these functions are
returned as a horizontal array of text values.
