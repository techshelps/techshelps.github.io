</UL> 
<P>
Summary:
<P>
Connecting to SQL Server for Sybase on a Unix Server is not supported
by Q+E for Microsoft Excel. The full Q+E retail package released by
Pioneer Software does ship with a driver that can connect to this
server and an upgrade is available for registered owners of Microsoft
Excel.
<P>
Contact Pioneer Software for more information regarding their product.
<P>
More Information:
<P>
The Q+E driver that ships with Microsoft Excel was developed to access
Microsoft SQL Server for OS/2 and uses Named Pipe services through the
Dynamic Link Library called NETAPI.DLL.
<P>
The Q+E driver makes use of the named pipes to connect to the server.
Named pipes do not function the same way under the TCP/IP software
that these Unix based Servers generally use for networking.
<P>
It has been reported that Sybase has developed Network libraries that
are available to allow Windows Applications to connect to Unix Servers
using TCP/IP protocol. There have been varied reports as to how well
this works with Q+E.
<P>
To obtain the connectivity software from Sybase, contact them at
(510)596-3333.
<P>
To obtain the retail package of Q+E, contact Pioneer Software Sales at
(800) 876-3101. There is a charge for the upgrade.
