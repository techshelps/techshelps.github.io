</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Excel with Microsoft Windows version 3.1,
you may receive one or both of the following error messages when you
attempt to print a chart to any type of dot matrix printer:
<P>
<PRE>   Out of Memory

   -or-

   Error Printing to &lt;Printer Name&gt; on &lt;Port&gt;

</PRE>Alternatively, you may not receive an error message, but your printed
document may be blank.
<P>
These error messages or blank printer output occur when the Windows
printer driver is low on memory and is unable to create the bitmapped
image of the chart.
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are running Microsoft Windows in standard mode, this problem
may occur if your machine has 4 megabytes (MB) or less of RAM and a
low amount of contiguous hard drive space. In order to print your
chart, you will need to increase your contiguous hard drive space by
removing as many unnecessary applications and files as possible and
then compressing your drive using a disk compression application.
<P>
In enhanced mode, this problem may occur if you have a small permanent
swapfile (1 MB or less), or a temporary swapfile that is small due to
a low amount of contiguous, available hard drive space. To increase
the size of the permanent swapfile:

<OL><P><LI>In the Control Panel, choose the 386 Enhanced icon.

<P><LI>Choose the Virtual Memory button to display your current swapfile
   settings.

<P><LI>Choose the Change button to display the recommended maximum
   swapfile size.

<P><LI>Adjust the size of your file.
<P>
</OL>If you are unable to increase the size of your swapfile because it is
already set to the maximum size, you may have little available drive
space. Or, if you have a temporary swapfile that is forcibly small for
the same reason, the solution, for either type of swapfile, is to free
as much drive space as possible and then compress your hard drive.
After completing this process, you can then increase your permanent
swapfile size. Your temporary swapfile will automatically increase as
needed.
