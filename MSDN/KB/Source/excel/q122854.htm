XL5: Error When Macro Closes Its Own Workbook
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../vbapps/Q108507.htm">Q108507</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if a Visual Basic procedure is started by an
OnSheetDeactivate command and the procedure then closes the workbook in
which it is contained, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The application "Microsoft Excel" has unexpectedly quit, because an
   error of type 1 occurred.

</PRE> 
XL5: Custom Default Chart Format Not Applied to Embedded Chart
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q110829.htm">Q110829</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you create an embedded chart, the built-in default
chart format is always applied (even when you select a custom chart format
as the default).
<P>
 
XL5: Problems Scaling Embedded Excel Chart Object in Word
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../OFFICE/Q111805.htm">Q111805</A></B>
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: Microsoft Excel Chart Sheet</h3>
 
<P>
When you scale a Microsoft Excel 5.0 chart object that is embedded in a
Microsoft Word document, the chart plot area may be scaled while the chart
text, chart legend, and the object frame remain unscaled. These symptoms
occur if your chart is a separate chart sheet in Microsoft Excel (instead
of an embedded chart object in the Microsoft Excel worksheet).
<P>
Note: This only affects charts that you embed in Word; it does not apply to
linked charts.
<P>
 
XL5: Can't Link to Worksheet with Exclamation Point in Name
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q111941.htm">Q111941</A></B>
<P>
If you link information from a Microsoft Excel worksheet to a client
application when the worksheet name contains an exclamation point
(!), one of the following may occur:

<UL><LI>You receive an error message in the client application
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The information appears in the client application, but the link
   cannot be edited or updated
<P>
</UL> 
XL5: Chart References to Pivot Table Not Updated Correctly
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q112031.htm">Q112031</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you create a chart from data in a pivot table, and
you move either the chart or the pivot table to another workbook, changes
you make to the pivot table while the workbook containing the chart is
closed may not be reflected in the chart.
<P>
 
XL5: Embedded Chart Object Grouped with Drawing Objects
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q112078</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you create multiple drawing objects on a worksheet
and group them, and you then create an embedded chart object, the chart
becomes part of the group when you close and reopen the file that contains
the objects. This problem occurs whether you group the drawing objects
before or after you create the embedded chart.
<P>
 
XL5: Save As or Delete Dialog Box Doesn't Close on OK
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../vbapps/Q112178.htm">Q112178</A></B>
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed above, when you use the SAVE.AS?
function or the FILE.DELETE? function in a Microsoft Excel version 4.0
macro sheet, and you use ERROR(FALSE) to avoid displaying error messages,
the Save As or the Delete dialog box does not close when you choose OK.
<P>
 
ECHO() Command Doesn't Work Correctly with ACTIVATE() Command
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q118320</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, the ECHO() macro function controls screen updating
while a macro is running. This command is usually used to speed up large
macros that update the screen frequently. If the ACTIVATE() macro function
is used to activate a worksheet window, and if you have previously turned
off screen updating with an ECHO(FALSE) command, the worksheet window will
be displayed and you will not see the contents of the window being
activated.
<P>
 
Help Key on Keyboard Doesn't Run Macro Assigned to Help Button
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q118878</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you run a custom dialog box that contains a button
that is formatted as a help button, the macro assigned to the help button
does not run when you press the Help or COMMAND+- keys.
<P>
 
XL5: Can't Open File with Chart That Refers to Bound Worksheet
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q118957</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you open a Microsoft Excel version 4.0 file that
contains a chart with references to a bound worksheet, one of the following
occurs if the worksheet name contains a bracket character ([]):

<UL><LI>If the file is a workbook, and the sheet that contains the chart is the
   first sheet in the workbook, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot load an empty Microsoft Excel 4.0 workbook
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>If the file is a workbook, and the sheet that contains the chart is NOT
   the first sheet in the workbook, you do not receive an error message,
   but the workbook does not open.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>If the file is a worksheet or a chart, you do not receive an error
   message, but the worksheet or chart file does not open.
<P>
</UL> 
XL: Error or Hang Deleting Toolbar Shortcut Submenu Item
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q118959</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you delete a custom submenu item from the Toolbar
shortcut menu using the Delete method in a Visual Basic, Applications
Edition procedure, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>      Run-time error '1004':

      Delete method of MenuItem class failed

</PRE> 
MXL5: Only One Copy of Document Printed from Print Preview
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q120258</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you print multiple copies of a document from print
preview, only one copy is printed.
<P>
 
MXL5: Template Filenames Don't Appear in File Open Dialog Box
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q121821</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for the Macintosh, files that are saved as
templates will not be visible in the Open dialog box (from the file menu,
choose Open) when the List Files Of Type box is set to Templates.
<P>
 
MXL5: Workbook Created When Inserting Excel Worksheet
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q122066</A></B>
<P>
When you insert a Microsoft Excel 5.0 Worksheet object in another
application, a new workbook is created, along with the inserted worksheet
object.
<P>
 
MXL5: Rotated Text in Text Box Prints to Bottom of Page
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q122067.htm">Q122067</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you position a text box that contains rotated
text on top of a page break on your worksheet, the text in the text
box extends to the bottom of the first page, and begins at the top of
the next page when you print the worksheet.
<P>
 
MXL5: Not All Worksheets Use Selected Printer Option
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q122068.htm">Q122068</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you print a selection of worksheets, or when you
print the entire workbook, not all of the worksheets are printed with the
selected printer options.
<P>
 
MXL5: Can't Use Cut/Copy/Paste Keys in Dialog
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q122069.htm">Q122069</A></B>
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you cannot use shortcut keys to cut, copy, or paste
information in the cell reference boxes in the Macro, Cell Note, or Define
Name dialog boxes.
