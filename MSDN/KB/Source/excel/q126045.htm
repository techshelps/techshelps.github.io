The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a Microsoft Excel workbook by double-clicking the workbook
icon or alias in the Finder, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':

   Range Method of &lt;object&gt; Class Failed

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message occurs when you open a workbook by double-clicking the
file if the file contains an Auto_Open macro that uses the Range method to
select a specific cell or range of cells. For example, this error message
appears when you open a workbook (by double-clicking the workbook icon in
the Finder) that contains the following Visual Basic macro:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Auto_Open
      Sheets("Sheet2").Select
      Range("A1").Select
   End Sub

</PRE>The Range method fails when it is used with the Select method in any of the
following situations:

<UL><LI>An Auto_Open macro

<LI>A macro that is called by an Auto_Open macro

<LI>Any macro assigned to a dialog control whose dialog box is displayed by
   an Auto_Open macro
<P>
</UL>Note that the Range method does not fail in these situations if the
workbook is opened from within Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>

procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality

</PRE>To avoid receiving this error message when you use the Range method in a
Visual Basic macro, use any of the following methods:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Open the workbook that contains the Auto_Open macro within Microsoft Excel
by clicking Open on the File menu instead of opening the file in the
Finder.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Cells method instead of the Range method in the situations
described above. For example, the following statement in a Visual Basic
macro
<P>
<PRE>   Range("A1").Select

</PRE>could be changed to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Cells(1,1).Select

</PRE><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Offset method to refer to the cell in terms of its relationship to
the active cell instead of using the Range method.
<P>
For example, to select cell A1 using the Offset method, you can use the
following statement:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveCell.Offset(-1*Activecell.Row+1, _
      -1*Activecell.Column+1).Select

</PRE>To select cell B5, you can use the following statement:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveCell.Offset(-1*Activecell.Row+5, _
      -1*Activecell.Column+5).Select

</PRE>Note that you must also use the Cells method or the Offset method instead
of the Range method in all subsequent lines in the Auto_Open macro, or in
any macro called by the Auto_Open macro.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 4</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Resize method to refer to a contiguous range of cells.
<P>
For example, to select cells A1 through C5, you can use the following
statement:
<P>
<PRE>   Cells(1,1).Resize(5,3).Select

</PRE><h3>Method 5</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Union and Cells methods to refer to discontiguous ranges of cells.
<P>
For example, to select cells A1 through C5 and cells E11 through F15, use
the following statement:
<P>
<PRE>   Union(Cells(1,1).Resize(5,3), _
      Cells(11,5).Resize(5,3)).Select

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are different scenarios in which the Range method returns the
run-time error described above.
<P>
<P><h3>Scenario 1</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the Range method in an Auto_Open macro for a workbook, you may
receive this error. For example, you receive the run-time error when you
double-click a workbook in the Finder that contains the following macro:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Auto_Open()
      Worksheets(1).Select
      Range("A1").Select
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Scenario 2</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the Range method in a macro that is called from an Auto_Open
macro in a workbook, you may receive this error. For example, you receive
the run-time error when you double-click a workbook in the Finder that
contains the following macros:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Auto_Open()
      Macro1
   End Sub

   Sub Macro1()
      Worksheets(1).Select
      Range("A1").Select
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Scenario 3</h3>
 
<P>
If the Range method is used in any macro that is assigned to a dialog box
control and the dialog box is displayed in an Auto_Open macro, this error
may also occur. For example, if BOOK1 contains a dialog sheet "Dialog1"
that contains a button "Button 1," and "Button 1" is assigned to the macro
"Button1_Click," you receive the run-time error when you double-click BOOK1
in the Finder, and then click "Button 1":
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Auto_Open()
      Dialogsheets("Dialog1").Show
   End Sub

   Sub Button1_Click()
      Worksheets(1).Select
      Range("A1").Select
   End Sub
</PRE>
