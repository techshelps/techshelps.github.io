The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information about using a Microsoft Excel toolbar
settings file that is stored on a shared location on a network.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Toolbars allow you to organize the commands in Microsoft Excel so that you
can find and use them quickly. For example, you can add and remove menus
and buttons, create your own custom toolbars, hide or display toolbars, and
move toolbars. In Microsoft Excel 5.0 and 7.0, toolbars contain only
buttons. Now toolbars can contain buttons, menus, or a combination of both.
<P>
When you quit Microsoft Excel, changes you make to the menu bar and built-
in toolbars, custom toolbars you create, and toolbars you display are saved
in a toolbars settings file in the Windows folder. This Microsoft Excel
saves this settings file as &lt;Username&gt;8.xlb, where &lt;Username&gt; is your
Windows or network logon name. If your computer is not connected to a
network, or is not set up with a logon prompt, Microsoft Excel saves the
settings file as Excel8.xlb.
<P>
Microsoft Excel 97 also allows you to use a toolbar settings file from a
shared location on the network. This allows you to log on to any computer
that has access to the network and gain access to a personal toolbar and
menu settings file on the network server.
<P>
To use this feature, you must add a key to the registration database on
each of the computers that is connected to the network.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
To use a Microsoft Excel toolbar settings file from a network share, use
the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the user's toolbar settings file to a shared folder on the
   network. This file is located in the Windows folder on any computer on
   which the user logged-on and ran Microsoft Excel.
<P>
   Note that running Microsoft Excel creates a local toolbar settings file
   called &lt;Username&gt;8.xlb, where &lt;Username&gt; is the Windows or network logon
   name of the current user.

<P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without
   the quotation marks), and click OK.

<P><LI>Open the following key in the registry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Excel\Microsoft Excel
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click New, and click String Value.

<P><LI>Type "CmdBarFile" (without the quotation marks) as the name of the new
   String Value.

<P><LI>Leave the CmdBarFile String Value selected, and click Modify on the Edit
   menu.
<P>
   This step opens the Edit String dialog box. In the Data Value box, type
   a valid path to the shared folder on the network that contains the
   user's toolbar file.
<P>
   The following example shows the syntax to use for the string:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\&lt;Servername&gt;\&lt;Sharename&gt;\
</PRE><P>
   where Servername is the name of the server on which the shared folder
   that contains the toolbar setting file is located, and Sharename is the
   name of the shared folder.
<P>
   IMPORTANT: The path must end with a trailing backslash, and the user
   must have read/write permission to the shared folder and the toolbar
   file.
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about toolbars or menus, click the Index tab in
Microsoft Excel 97 Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   toolbar, menu

</PRE></OL>and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Menus"
topic.
