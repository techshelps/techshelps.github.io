<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you scroll through a zoomed document after you
print a file or view it in print preview, the characters that are off of
the screen may appear much larger than the indicated size.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when you open a document that is zoomed to any size
other than 100%, and when you then immediately print the document or view
it in print preview. Characters that did not appear on the screen before
you printed it or viewed it in print preview may appear much larger than
expected if they are formatted differently than the characters that
appeared on the screen when you printed the document.
<P>
Formatting attributes that may not appear as expected include the font,
size, underlining, or color.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, close the document and reopen it. To prevent
this behavior from occurring, scroll through the document before you print
it or before you view a it in print preview.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
