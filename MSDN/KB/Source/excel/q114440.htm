The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you remove a floppy disk or disconnect from a
network drive that contains a workbook file that you are editing, an
error message appears when you continue editing the workbook. The
error message that you receive depends on the data that is contained
in the workbook you are editing and the types of changes you make to the
workbook. The following is a summary of these error messages and when
you receive them.
<P>
<P><h3>Linked or Embedded Object</h3>
 
<P>
If the workbook contains a linked or embedded object, when you edit
the object or create another object, you receive the following error
messages:

<UL><LI>Editing or inserting an embedded or linked object
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot start source application
</PRE>
<LI>Pasting a new linked or embedded object
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot paste data
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>Visual Basic Module</h3>
 
<P>
If the workbook contains a Visual Basic module, and you try to run a
procedure contained in the module, or to insert a new module in the
workbook, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to read from the disk

</PRE><h3>Pivot Tables</h3>
 
<P>
If the workbook contains a pivot table, and you attempt to edit the
pivot table, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to obtain PivotTable data from disk

</PRE>Note that you can create a new pivot table in the workbook under the
above conditions without receiving an error message, even if the
workbook already contains a pivot table.
<P>
<P><h3>Saving File</h3>
 
<P>
When you save a workbook file to another location, such as your hard disk
drive, the following error message appears if the workbook file contains a
pivot table, linked or embedded object, or a Visual Basic module, and you
do not have access to the disk that contains the workbook file:
<P>
<PRE>   Document not saved

</PRE>Note that when you save a workbook that contains a Visual Basic
module, you may also receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to write to the disk

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, workbook files are not stored
entirely in memory. Some elements of the workbook are stored on the
disk your file is stored on. This is a change from the way the
earlier versions of Microsoft Excel stored files.
<P>
When you create a pivot table, an OLE object, or a Visual Basic
module in a workbook, you must have continuous access to the drive that
contains the workbook, because these items are stored on the drive.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid running into problems when you are working on files off of a
floppy or a network drive, do not remove the floppy or disconnect
from the network drive until you have closed the file you are working
on.
<P>
To avoid receiving an error message in any of the above situations,
you must insert the floppy disk, or connect to the network drive that
contains the workbook file. You can then edit and create OLE objects,
pivot tables and Visual Basic modules, and you can also save the
workbook file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a new workbook file in Microsoft Excel, two temporary
files are created in your TEMP directory. The location of your TEMP
directory is determined by the SET TEMP statement in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The two temporary files have names similar to the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   ~1808.TMP
   ~DFT180D.TMP

</PRE>These files created because Microsoft Excel version 5.0 uses the
Docfile format in object linking and embedding (OLE) version 2.0.
<P>
When you open an existing workbook, a temporary file is created
either in your TEMP directory or in the directory that contains the
file.
