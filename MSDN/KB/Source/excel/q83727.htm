The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh versions 3.0, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Unlocked cells in a Microsoft Excel worksheet that is saved as a WKx
file will lose the Normal style font and font color information. When
the worksheet is opened in Microsoft Excel, the data in the unlocked
cells will  be blue and in the Courier, 10 point font. In Microsoft
Excel version 4.0, directly formatting unprotected cells with a font
or size other than the Normal style and/or a color other than dark
blue will prevent this from occurring.
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur in later versions of Microsoft Excel for
Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel imports WKx unprotected cells with a font color of
blue. This  was done to emulate the greenish color Lotus uses to
denote  unprotected cells. In Microsoft Excel 3.0 for Windows, most
formatting is not  retained when saving to a WKx format and as a
result the entire  worksheet will convert to Courier, size 10. The
behavior is the same  in Microsoft Excel 3.0 for the Macintosh with
the exception that the font will  revert to or remain at Geneva, the
default font.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 4.0, when saving to a WKx format, the formatting
information  is saved in a separate file as is done in Lotus versions
2.x and 3.x.  These files are Impress files, saved with an .FMT
extension when  saving to a WK1 format and .FM3 when saving to a WK3
format. When a  WKx worksheet is opened in Microsoft Excel 4.0, the
.FMx formatting is applied.  With the exception of unlocked cells
formatted in the Normal style,  the worksheet will retain its
formatting.
<P>
As in Microsoft Excel 3.0, the unprotected cells will convert to
Courier, size  10 and they will be imported with dark blue font
coloring. However, in  Microsoft Excel 4.0, if the file is then saved,
closed, and opened again, the  font color will revert to black (the
default for Microsoft Excel) though the  typeface will still be
Courier. The dark blue font color in  unprotected cells will not be
saved to maintain compatibility with  importing these files into
Lotus.
<P>
Formatting unlocked cells with a font typeface or size other than the
Normal style and/or a font color other than dark blue will allow
unlocked cells to retain their formatting.
