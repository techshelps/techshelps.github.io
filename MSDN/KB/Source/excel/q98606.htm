</UL>*** Notes on the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder ***
<P>
<P><h3>A - Tips and Techniques Examples</h3>
 
<P>
To assist EIS developers with creative design techniques, an
additional application has been created.  This application may be
found in the Examples directory under the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder
directory (the default is C:\EISPAK\EISBLDR\EXAMPLES).
<P>
This application features online discussion of special techniques used
to create the user interface.  To get the most benefit out of this
application, start by loading the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder
(AUTHOR.XLA).  Once loaded, open the application by selecting the Open
command from the EIS menu, and select XAMPLS.XLA.
<P>
<PRE>   Note: The Queries Help topic indicates that the examples XLA file
   is called EXAMPLES.XLA. The correct file name is XAMPLES.XLA not
   EXAMPLES.XLA.

</PRE><h3>B - Using Online Help</h3>
 
<P>
As you begin using the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder, you should spend a
few minutes reviewing EIS Builder Help.  Much of the detailed
information you need to know on actions, arguments, dialog box
options, settings details, and other important topics is readily
available through the online Help facility.  Whenever the EIS Builder
is loaded, Help may be accessed by choosing the EIS Builder Help
command from the Microsoft Excel Help menu.  If you want to access
context-sensitive information for a specific dialog box, click the
Help button in that dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>C - Using the CompuServe Forum</h3>
 
<P>
If you wish to request support from Microsoft Product Support Services
or share ideas with other users, a CompuServe Forum is available.  The
forum provides a vehicle for users to share ideas and sample
applications. To use the forum, go to the Microsoft Excel forum, where
you will have access to the EIS Pak section.  For more information on
the Microsoft Compuserve forum, see "Product Support Services" in
either the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder User's Guide, or in Microsoft
Excel EIS Builder Help.
<P>
For step-by-step instructions on using EIS Builder Help, see "Before
You Begin" in the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>D - Installing the Open EIS Pak With A Network Copy of Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
Although the Microsoft Open EIS Pak can be used with a network
resident copy of Microsoft Excel, the SETUP program will not recognize
a copy of Microsoft Excel on the network. To install the Open EIS Pak
when your EXCEL.EXE is on a network:

<OL><P><LI>Create an EXCEL directory on your local hard disk.

<P><LI>Using either the MS-DOS COPY command or the Windows file manager,
   copy the EXCEL.EXE file to your local EXCEL directory.

<P><LI>When the Open EIS Pak setup program prompts you for the location of
   your copy of Microsoft Excel 4.0, enter C:\EXCEL (or the location
   of your EXCEL.EXE file copied in step 2 above).

<P><LI>After completing installation of the Open EIS Pak, delete the local
   copy of EXCEL.EXE.
<P>
</OL><h3>E - Using International Versions of Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
The version of the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder contained on these
diskettes will not work with international versions of Microsoft
Excel.  If you wish to use the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder with a
version of Microsoft Excel other than English, please contact your
local Microsoft subsidiary.
<P>
Like the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder, the sample applications
contained on these diskettes also require the English language version
of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h3>F - FILEFNS files</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Excel Builder requires two optionally installed
Microsoft Excel files.  Although these files are typically installed
with the full Microsoft Excel 4.0 setup, if you have used a custom
setup option, they may not have been installed. If either FILEFNS.XLA
or FILEFNS.DLL is not present in your EXCEL\LIBRARY directory, they
must be installed prior to using the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder. To
manually install the files:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Open EIS Pak diskette #2 into your diskette
   drive.

<P><LI>Using either the MS-DOS COPY command or the Windows File Manager,
   copy the files to your EXCEL\LIBRARY directory.

<P><LI>If Excel is running, you will need to exit Microsoft Excel and
   restart the program in order for these files to be recognized.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>G - Halt Tool Changes</h3>
 
<P>
When you are creating an application with the Microsoft Excel EIS
Builder, you may wish to test the application using the Run command on
the EIS Menu. When the application is being run from within "author
mode," a single icon appears on a Halt tool bar in the upper left
corner of the window. By clicking on this icon, the application being
run halts and you are returned to author mode.
<P>
If the application being run uses the standard Excel menu, the
developer may also return to author mode by choosing the Halt command
from the EIS Menu. The application will then be halted, and the Halt
command will change back to the original Run command.
<P>
Should you wish to hide the toolbar, it may be hidden by clicking in
the upper left corner of the toolbar. In order to return to author
mode, you must either select the EIS Halt command, or enter CTRL+H.
<P>
<P><h3>H - Alternate Installation of the Run-Time Files</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft EIS Builder utilizes three run-time files.  These files
may be freely copied to users who do not have a licensed copy of the
Microsoft Excel EIS Builder. Such users, however, will require a
licensed copy of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
These files are:
<P>
<PRE>EIS.XLA        = the main EIS macro

XTACTION.XLA      = the dialog box and functions for crosstab tables
        on EIS Views

EISUSER.HLP     = the Windows Help file for users of an application
        built with the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder

</PRE></OL>By default, the Microsoft Open EIS Pak Setup program installs these
files in the C:\EISPAK\EISBLDR directory.  The Setup program also
installs EIS.XLA and EISUSER.XLA in the directories used by the EIS
Limited sample application (C:\EISPAK\SAMPLES\EISLTD) and the Tips and
Techniques Example application (C:\EISPAK\EISBLDR\EXAMPLES).
<P>
If instead you wish to have a single copy of these files on your hard
disk, they may be copied to your Excel Library directory (typically
C:\EXCEL\LIBRARY) and deleted from other locations. Files may be
copied using an MS-DOS COPY command or the Windows File Manager.
Whenever a user's EIS application files is opened and these run-time
files are not present in the same directory, the application will
automatically look in the Excel Library directory for these files.
<P>
<P><h3>I - Moving or Deleting Files</h3>
 
<P>
Should you wish to delete or "uninstall" any of the Open EIS Pak
applications, the files may simply be deleted. The Open EIS Pak files
do not require any changes to *.INI files, however, deletion of files
may result in your being unable to run the software.  If this occurs,
simply reinstall the software using the setup program on your
diskettes.
<P>
Should you wish to move any of the Open EIS Pak files to another
location, they may be copied provided that all files in old
directories remain together in the new directories, and that the new
directories adhere to the structure noted in the default file directory
listings later in this document. The only exception to this pertains
to the Run-Time files, described above.
<P>
<P><h3>J - Restoring A Minimized Application While Using DDE Links</h3>
 
<P>
To use a Perform DDE action, you must activate the application in
which the action is being performed, and restore the application if it
is minimized. The Activate Application action in the Inter-application
action class should be used to activate the application.
<P>
The commands needed to restore an application vary between
applications.  In general, use a Perform DDE action which contains the
keystrokes necessary to restore the application.  For many windows
applications, an operation of % r (equivalent to Alt - space - r) can
be used.
<P>
K - Creating EIS Applications For
<PRE>    Both Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows Users
</PRE> 
<P>
The Microsoft Excel EIS Builder is designed to enable authors to
easily port applications between the Microsoft Windows and Apple
Macintosh platforms.  This is accomplished through the use of a common
application macro file format (APP.XLA), and the cross-platform design
of the  EIS Builder run-time files (EIS.XLA &amp; XTACTION.XLA). By using
MS-DOS 8.3 file names, the EIS Builder links are automatically
preserved when porting applications between platforms.
<P>
The following issues should be considered when developing EIS
applications to be used by both Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows
users.
<P>
1-EIS Builder and Run-Time Files
<P>
EIS authors who intend to deploy a single application across both
Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows platforms should have a copy of
the Microsoft Open EIS Pak for Windows and the Microsoft Open EIS Pak
for the Macintosh.  Authors may use either set of EIS Builder files,
however, end-users should use the run-time files for their Microsoft
Excel platform.
<P>
2-Path and File Names
<P>
In order to eliminate the need to maintain separate files whose links
are updated manually, authors deploying cross-platform applications
should adhere to a common set of MS-DOS 8.3 filenames.  This file
naming convention will be valid in both the Apple Macintosh and
Microsoft Windows environments. Although these environments use
different path separator characters (":" on the Macintosh, and "\"
under Windows), the EIS.XLA macros will automatically use the
character appropriate for the version of Microsoft Excel being run.
As with file names, authors should take care to use a common
folder/directory naming scheme.  For example, the following EIS
application macro file could be run in both environments:
<P>
<PRE>     Apple Macintosh:
     Finance:EIS:FinEIS.XLA
     Microsoft Windows:
     FINANCE\EIS\FINEIS.XLA

</PRE>3-Using The EIS.GETPLATFORM Function
<P>
When deploying cross-platform applications, authors are face
differences in bitmap formats, DDE syntax, and query facilities.
Because the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder enables authors to run scripts
based upon a condition, the following custom function macro has been
added to the EIS.XLA file:
<P>
<PRE>     EIS.GETPLATFORM()

</PRE>This function returns "Mac" when Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh is
running, and "Win" when Microsoft Excel for Windows is running.
<P>
By using this function in a conditional expression, authors can
develop and distribute a common set of files that automatically
evaluate the user's platform and run the appropriate script.
<P>
For example, the author could create the following two named scripts
to produce a query of sales data:
<P>
<PRE>     "Query Sales (Mac)"
     "Query Sales (Win)"

</PRE>A single "Get Sales Data" button on a user's view could then run the
following script:
<P>
<PRE>     IF
     THEN
     Run Named Script: Query
</PRE>Sales (Mac)
<PRE>     ELSE
     Run Named Script: Query
</PRE>Sales (Win)
<PRE>     ENDIF

</PRE>By using the following condition for the IF statement, this script
would automatically support both Macintosh and Windows users:
<P>
<PRE>   EIS.GETPLATFORM() = "Mac"

</PRE>For more information on the use of conditional expressions, search for
the keyword "condition" in the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder help
facility.
<P>
4-Use of Bitmaps
<P>
Authors deploying cross-platform applications should avoid the use of
bitmap objects, since these will not port cleanly between the Apple
Macintosh  and Microsoft Windows environments.  In such applications,
it is recommended that end- user functionality be implemented using
custom menus rather than on-sheet pictures.  If on-sheet buttons are
used, authors should limit their use to those which are not bitmaps.
The non-bitmap buttons are:
<P>
<PRE>     Macintosh Buttons   Equivalent Windows Buttons
     ----------------------------------------------

     MS Excel Button     3-D Button
     Stick-It-Note       Stick-It-Note
     Text Box            Text Box
     Transparent Button  Transparent Button
     3-D Cell Overlay    3-D Cell Overlay

</PRE>Another alternative is to have the script display a different view,
depending upon the platform being used.  In this case, the author
would create a Mac version of the view worksheet(with Mac bitmaps),
and a Windows version of the worksheet (with Win bitmaps).  By using a
condition to determine which view to display, a single application can
easily support both Macintosh and Windows users. For more information,
see the "Using The EIS.GETPLATFORM Function" section above.
<P>
5-Reassigning EIS Macros To New Bitmaps
<P>
If bitmaps with script actions are used, the author may wish to paste
new bitmaps into a ported file.  When this is done, any macro scripts
assigned to the original bitmap must be manually reassigned to the new
bitmap. The easiest procedure for reassigning bitmap scripts is:

<OL><P><LI>Port the Excel worksheet from the Macintosh to Windows or vice versa.

<P><LI>Open the worksheet file containing a bitmap

<P><LI>Paste a new bitmap onto the sheet.

<P><LI>Select the original bitmap object (on the Macintosh use Command-Click;
   in Windows use CTRL-Left Click)

<P><LI>From the Excel Macro Menu, select the Assign To Object Command,
   and then choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Select the new bitmap object

<P><LI>From the Excel Edit Menu, select the Repeat Assign To Object Command.
<P>
</OL>The above sequence of steps will automatically assign the old bitmap
macro script to the new bitmap. At this point, the author should
reselect and delete the old bitmap.
<P>
6-DDE Script Actions
<P>
DDE script action arguments vary between the Apple Macintosh and
Microsoft Windows environments.  Consider the following two "Initiate
DDE Channel" script arguments to open a Microsoft Word Document:
<P>
<PRE>   Document Type        Document Name
   --------------------------------------------------

   Apple Macintosh:  WordDocument   TESTFILE.DOC
   Microsoft Windows:  WINWORD   TESTFILE.DOC

</PRE></OL>For more information on DDE script action arguments, look up "DDE" in
your product documentation index.
<P>
Although DDE syntax differs on these two platforms, it is possible to
execute the DDE calls conditionally (according to the platform on
which the DDE script is running).  For more information, see the
"Using The EIS.GETPLATFORM Function" section above.
<P>
<P>
7-External Database Queries
<P>
On the Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Excel supports the Apple Data Access
Language (DAL) for external database queries.  This support requires
installation of the Data Access Macro (DAM) option with your copy of
Microsoft Excel.
<P>
Under Microsoft Windows, external database query support is
accomplished with Q+E. This support requires installation of the Q+E
driver option with your copy of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
Regardless of whether the Apple Macintosh or Microsoft Windows
environment is being run, the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder relies upon
a common query statement stored on a worksheet.  This query is stored
in a named range called "SQL_Statement".  Due to the environmental
differences between the Data Access Language and Q+E, EIS
authors deploying queries across platforms may not be able to share the
same query sheets across platforms.  Although the required query
scripts differ on these two platforms, it is possible to execute the
queries conditionally (according to the platform on which the DDE
script is running).  For more information, see the "Using The
EIS.GETPLATFORM Function" section above.
<P>
*** Files Included with The Microsoft Open EIS Pak ****
<P>
When you run Setup from the Setup disk, all the files you need to run
the sample applications and the Microsoft Excel EIS builder are
copied.
<P>
To save space on the disks, many files shipped with Microsoft Open EIS
Pak are compressed. Compressed files are identified by a "_" in the
file extension. These files cannot be used directly with Microsoft
Windows or Microsoft applications; they must be decompressed before
use. When you run Setup from the Setup disk, these files are
automatically decompressed.
<P>
<P><h3>L - Starting the Sample Applications</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Open EIS Pak diskettes contain four sample EIS
applications.  A set of application profiles is included in the Pak.
These profiles provide important information on the design
considerations and unique aspects of each demo, as well as start-up
information.  All of these sample applications require Microsoft Excel
4.0 or later.

</PRE><h3>Files Not Installed by the Open EIS Pak Setup Program</h3>
 
<P>
The following uncompressed files are included on Disk 2:
<P>
<PRE>   FILEFNS.DLL
   FILEFNS.XLA
   EISPAK.ICO

</PRE>Although the FILEFNS files are typically included in a full
installation of Microsoft Excel 4.0, they may not be present on your
system.  Both of these files must be present in your EXCEL\LIBRARY
directory *prior* to using the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder. To install
the files, simply use the MS-DOS COPY command or the Windows File
Manager to copy the files to your EXCEL\LIBRARY directory.
<P>
The EISPAK.ICO file may be used to represent either the Microsoft
Excel EIS Builder or the sample applications as part of a Windows
Program Manager group. For help on specifying Program Manager icon,
see either "Icons" or "Program-item Icons" in the index of your
Microsoft Windows User's Guide.
