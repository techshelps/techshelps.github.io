<P><h3>*** Notes on the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder ***</h3>
 
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Using International Versions of Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
The version of the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder contained on these
diskettes was tested with the following eleven language versions of
Microsoft Excel 4.0 for Microsoft Windows:
<P>
Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian,
Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish.
<P>
When creating an EIS application in a language other than English, the
authoring facility will still operate in English. The application
which is created for the end-user, however, will operate in any of the
language versions of Microsoft Excel listed above.
<P>
The first time you run the Microsoft Excel Builder, the system checks
which version of Microsoft Excel you are running. If you are running a
version other than English, macros in the REPLACE.XLA file are run so
that the EIS Builder is made compatible with your version of Microsoft
Excel. To be able to run the EIS Builder, you then need to open the
AUTHOR.XLA file after the substitution is done. REPLACE.XLA will
remain open until you exit Excel.
<P>
It is important that the language information you give in the
Localizer dialog box match your Windows settings. You can use the
Windows Control Panel to verify these settings. It is also important
that you don't modify the default List separator in the Control Panel
for the EIS Builder to run properly.
<P>
When creating an application with the EIS Builder, you may notice that
some dialog boxes contain mixed language buttons. This is due to the
fact that these buttons are used in both author/user modes of the
Builder. This does not cause any functionality problems, and will not
be displayed to the end-user.
<P>
Most of the materials contained on these diskettes (including the
sample application) are in English. They will run, however, with the
eleven versions of Excel listed above. Most of the concepts discussed
in the User's Guide are also independent of any particular language or
environment. Some specific examples may require different syntax if
used with a non-English version of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
When you distribute applications created with the Microsoft Excel
Builder, it is important that you also distribute a copy of EIS.XLA,
XTACTION.XLA, and EISUSER.HLP (Microsoft Excel EIS Builder Runtime
files) as set up on your hard disk *after* REPLACE.XLA is run.
<P>
Applications created with one language version of Microsoft Excel
and/or one set of country settings selected during authoring will
require some manual editing to be run under different Microsoft Excel
version and/or country settings.
<P>
If you are running Portuguese Microsoft Excel, Reports and Views
Manager are not available in your version, and are therefore not
accessible by the Microsoft Excel Builder.
<P>
If you are running Portuguese or Spanish Microsoft Excel, Q+E is not
included in these versions and you won't be able to handle queries in
the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Using Online Help</h3>
 
<P>
The Setup gives four options regarding Help:  English, French, German,
and None. Any of the Help versions will run on top of any Microsoft
Excel version. If you choose None, you will get an alert message when
Help is invoked. The Help is written for the authors of EIS
applications, but in some cases, end-users may be able to view the
topics. Alerts are translated and these provide end-user instructions.
<P>
It is recommended that you pick one language version of the Help as a
substantial amount of information is not available in the printed
documentation. If you wish to prevent end-users from seeing this
information, simply remove the *.HLP files from their directory.
<P>
As you begin using the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder, you should spend a
few minutes reviewing EIS Builder Help. Much of the detailed
information you need to know on actions, arguments, dialog box
options, settings details, and other important topics is readily
available through the online Help facility. Whenever the EIS Builder
is loaded, Help may be accessed by choosing the EIS Builder Help
command from the Microsoft Excel Help menu. If you want to access
context-sensitive information for a specific dialog box, click the
Help button in that dialog box.
<P>
For step-by-step instructions on using EIS Builder Help, see "Before
You Begin" in the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>FILEFNS files</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Excel Builder requires two optionally installed
Microsoft Excel files to be able to run properly. If the files for
your language are not present on your hard disk, you will need to run
the Microsoft Excel Setup again to install them. Information for these
files is available in your Microsoft Excel Help file.
<P>
These files and the directory in which they are located are listed
below:
<P>
<PRE>Language    Excel 4 directory Filefns.xla Filefns.dll
********    ***************** *********** ***********
Danish      BIBLTEK              FILFUNK.XLA    FILFUNK.DLL
Dutch       BIBLIO               ESTFN.XLA      BESTFN.DLL
English     LIBRARY              ILEFNS.XLA     FILEFNS.DLL

Swedish     MAKROBIB              FILFUNK.XLA   FILFUNK.DLL

</PRE>*Note: This file is not included in the retail version of Microsoft
<PRE>       Excel and is installed during the Microsoft Excel Builder
       Setup. The file name is the same as for the English version.

</PRE>The correct Italian version of FUNZFILE.XLA is dated Dec-10-1992 on
your Microsoft Excel disks (size is 20584 bytes). The correct Swedish
version of FILFUNK.XLA is dated Dec-1-1992 on your Microsoft Excel
disks (size is 19917 bytes).
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Tips and Techniques Examples</h3>
 
<P>
To assist EIS developers with creative design techniques, an
additional application has been created. This application may be found
in the Examples directory (the default is C:\EISPAK\EXAMPLES).
<P>
This application features online discussion of special techniques used
to create the user interface. To get the most benefit out of this
application, start by loading the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder
(AUTHOR.XLA). Once loaded, open the application by selecting the Open
command from the EIS menu, and select XAMPLS.XLA. (Note:  The Queries
Help topic indicates that the examples XLA file is called
EXAMPLES.XLA. The correct file name is XAMPLS.XLA not EXAMPLES.XLA.)
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Halt Tool Changes</h3>
 
<P>
When you are creating an application with the Microsoft Excel EIS
Builder, you may wish to test the application using the Run command on
the EIS Menu. When the application is being run from within "author
mode," a single icon appears on a Halt tool bar in the upper left
corner of the window. By clicking on this icon or pressing CTRL+H, the
application being run halts and you are returned to author mode.
<P>
If the application being run uses the standard Microsoft Excel menu,
the developer may also return to author mode by choosing the Halt
command from the EIS Menu. The application will then be halted, and
the Halt command will change back to the original Run command.
<P>
Should you wish to hide the toolbar, it may be hidden by clicking in
the upper left corner of the toolbar. In order to return to author
mode, you must either select the EIS Halt command, or enter CTRL+H.
<P>
<P><h3>Alternate Installation of the Run-Time Files</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft EIS Builder utilizes three run-time files. These files
may be freely copied to users who do not have a licensed copy of the
Microsoft Excel EIS Builder. Such users, however, will require a
licensed copy of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
These files are:
<P>
<PRE>EIS.XLA         = the main EIS macro

XTACTION.XLA    = the dialog box and functions for crosstab tables
                  on EIS Views

EISUSER.HLP     = the Windows Help file for users of an application
                  built with the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder

</PRE>By default, the Microsoft Open EIS Pak Setup program installs these
files in the C:\EISPAK directory. The Setup program also installs
EIS.XLA and EISUSER.HLP in the directories used by the EIS Limited
sample application (C:\EISPAK\EISLTD) and the Tips and Techniques
Example application (C:\EISPAK\EXAMPLES).
<P>
If instead you wish to have a single copy of these files on your hard
disk, they may be copied to your Microsoft Excel Library directory
(C:\EXCEL\LIBRARY in English, for other language versions of Microsoft
Excel, see the directory information in the FILEFNS files section of
this document) and deleted from other locations. Files may be copied
using a DOS COPY command or the Windows File Manager. Whenever a
user's EIS application files is opened and these run-time files are
not present in the same directory, the application will automatically
look in the Microsoft Excel Library directory for these files.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Moving or Deleting Files</h3>
 
<P>
Should you wish to delete or "uninstall" any of the Open EIS Pak
applications, the files may simply be deleted. The Open EIS Pak files
do not require any changes to *.INI files, however, deletion of files
may result in your being unable to run the software. If this occurs,
simply reinstall the software using the Setup program on your
diskettes.
<P>
Should you wish to move any of the Open EIS Pak files to another
location, they may be copied provided that all files in old
directories remain together in the new directories, and that the new
directories adhere to the structure noted in the default file
directory listings later in this document. The only exception to this
pertains to the Run-Time files, described above.
<P>
<P><h3>Restoring Minimized Applications While Using DDE Links</h3>
 
<P>
To use a Perform DDE action, you must activate the application in
which the action is being performed, and restore the application if it
is minimized. The Activate Application action in the Inter-application
action class should be used to activate the application.
<P>
The commands needed to restore an application vary between
applications. In general, use a Perform DDE action which contains the
keystrokes necessary to restore the application. For many windows
applications, an operation of % r (equivalent to Alt - space - r) can
be used.
<P>
 
<P>
<P><h3>*** Files Included with The Microsoft Open EIS Pak ****</h3>
 
<P>
When you run Setup from the Setup disk, all the files you need to run
the sample application and the Microsoft Excel EIS Builder are copied.
<P>
To save space on the disks, many files shipped with Microsoft Open EIS
Pak are compressed. Compressed files are identified by a "_" in the
file extension. These files cannot be used directly with Microsoft
Windows or Microsoft applications; they must be decompressed before
use. When you run Setup from the Setup disk, these files are
automatically decompressed.
<P>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Starting the Sample Application</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Open EIS Pak diskettes contain one sample EIS
application. An application profile is included in the Pak. The
profile provides important information on the design considerations
and unique aspects of the demo, as well as start-up information. The
sample application requires Microsoft Excel 4.0 or later. In order to
ensure that it works properly, check to see that the directory
containing Microsoft Excel is included in your DOS path. The DOS path
is typically included in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If you are using
Microsoft Word for Windows, the subdirectories containing this
application also needs to be included in the DOS path.
