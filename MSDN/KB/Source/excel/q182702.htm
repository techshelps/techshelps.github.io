The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Although Microsoft does not recommend installing more than one version of
Microsoft Excel on a computer, it is possible to install and use more than
one version on the same computer. This article describes some problems that
you may encounter when you install more than one version of Excel on a
computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists some of the common problems that are associated with
running multiple versions of Excel. However, you may encounter problems
that are not listed in this article.
<P>
In most cases, the only solution to problems created by running multiple
versions of Excel is to run only one version of Excel on your computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Double-Clicking Files in Finder Starts Earlier Version of Excel</h3>
 
<P>
When you double-click a Microsoft Excel workbook, chart, or add-in file in
the Finder, the wrong version of Excel may be started, and the file is not
opened. For example, double-clicking an workbook saved in the Microsoft
Excel 98 Macintosh Edition file format starts Excel version 5.0.
<P>
This problem occurs because the installation program for Excel 5.0 sets the
modified date of the program file for Excel 5.0 to the date of
installation. If this date is later than the modified date of the program
file for Excel 98, Excel 5.0 is started when you use the Finder to double-
click an Excel workbook file.
<P>
To reduce the probability that this problem occurs, install Excel 98 and
Excel 5.0 on separate hard disk partitions. If you keep Excel 98 files on
the hard disk partition that contains Excel 98, this problem should not
occur.
<P>
NOTE: This workaround may not work in all cases.
<P>
<P><h3>Inserting Microsoft Excel Objects into Other Programs</h3>
 
<P>
If you install multiple versions of Microsoft Excel on a single computer
and you insert a Microsoft Excel Worksheet object into another program (for
example, Microsoft Word), the latest version of Microsoft Excel is used
when you insert the worksheet object.
<P>
For example, if you install the following programs on your computer
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Word for Macintosh, version 6.0
   Microsoft Excel for Macintosh, version 5.0
   Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition

</PRE>and then insert a Microsoft Excel Worksheet object into a Microsoft Word
document, an Excel 98 worksheet is added.
<P>
If you give a copy of a Word document containing a Microsoft Excel
Worksheet object to someone who does not have Excel 98, and the person
attempts to activate the object, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot edit the Excel.Sheet.8.

</PRE>NOTE: When you click Object on the Insert menu in Microsoft Word or
Microsoft PowerPoint, the following entries may appear in the Object type
list:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Excel 5.0 Chart
   Microsoft Excel 5.0 Worksheet
   Microsoft Excel Chart
   Microsoft Excel Worksheet

</PRE>An Excel 98 worksheet or chart object is inserted into the document
regardless of the list entry that you click.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Automation to Control Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
If you install multiple versions of Microsoft Excel on a computer and you
attempt to use Automation to control a specific version of Microsoft Excel,
it may be necessary to modify your Visual Basic for Applications code.
<P>

language being demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug
procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality

the following page on the World Wide Web:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/</A></B>

</PRE>For example, if you run the following Visual Basic for Applications macro
in Microsoft Word 97 while Excel 5.0 and Excel 98 are installed on your
computer
<P>
<PRE>   Sub AutomationTest()

      Dim xlApp As Object
      Set xlApp = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
      MsgBox xlApp.Version
      xlApp.Quit
      Set xlApp = Nothing

   End Sub

</PRE>you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '429':
   ActiveX xomponent can't create object

</PRE>To work around this problem, change the Set line to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Set xlApp = CreateObject("Excel.Application.8")

</PRE>The macro starts an instance of Excel 98, displays the version number of
Excel, then terminates Excel.
<P>
NOTE: You cannot use Automation to start Excel 5.0 if Excel 98 is installed
on your computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Shared Programs</h3>
 
<P>
The Object dialog box may display more than one entry for each shared
program; this behavior occurs because there may be multiple versions of the
shared program on your computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Problems Using Microsoft Query</h3>
 
<P>
If both Microsoft Query version 1.0 and Microsoft Query version 8.0 are
installed on your computer, you receive error messages when you use
Microsoft Query 8.0. To use Microsoft Query 8.0, you must remove Microsoft
Query 1.0 from your computer.
<P>

article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
