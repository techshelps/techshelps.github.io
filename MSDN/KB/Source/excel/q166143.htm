The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, if you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro 
that attempts to display the Format AutoShape dialog box, you may receive 
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':
   Show method of Dialog class failed

</PRE>Or, the Format AutoShape dialog box may simply fail to appear, and you do 
not receive an error message.
<P>
The same macro works correctly in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, and 
works occasionally in Microsoft Excel 97.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the aforementioned error message if both of the following
are true:

<UL><LI>Your macro contains a line of code similar to either of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Application.Dialogs(xlDialogPatterns).Show
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Application.ExecuteExcel4Macro ("PATTERNS?()")
</PRE><P>
   -and-

<LI>An AutoShape is selected when the above line of code is executed.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures

and/or fitness for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in 
this article are provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that 
they can be used in all situations. While Microsoft support engineers 
can help explain the functionality of a particular macro, they will not 
modify these examples to provide added functionality, nor will they 
help you construct macros to meet your specific needs. If you have 
limited programming experience, you may want to consult one of the 
Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution Providers offer a wide range of 
fee-based services, including creating custom macros. For more 
information about Microsoft Solution Providers, call Microsoft Customer 
Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
The xlDialogPatterns dialog box is not available for use with new 
drawing objects and AutoShapes in Microsoft Excel 97. However, it may be 
possible in some cases to display the Format AutoShape dialog box by 
using a line of code similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test1()
       SendKeys "^1", True
   End Sub

</PRE>If the drawing object or AutoShape is selected when this line of code is 
executed, the Format AutoShape dialog box will be displayed, and you can 
format the AutoShape. When you click OK or Cancel, the macro will 
continue.
<P>
If you have not renamed any of your drawing objects or AutoShapes, you 
can use code similar to the following to display the correct dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test2()

       'If the name of the drawing object begins with "AutoShape", then...
       If Left(Selection.Name, 9) = "AutoShape" Then

           '...use SendKeys to display the dialog box.
           SendKeys "^1", True

       'Otherwise, use the traditional method.
       Else
           Application.Dialogs(xlDialogPatterns).Show

       End If

   End Sub

</PRE>Note that these methods may not always work, since it is not always 
possible to guarantee that the sent keys will produce the desired result. 
Note also that the SendKeys method is not available in Microsoft Excel for 
the Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
AutoShapes are a group of ready-made shapes that include such basic shapes
as rectangles and circles, plus a variety of lines and connectors, block
arrows, flowchart symbols, stars and banners, and callouts. The AutoShapes
that may cause the problem described above are most of those found on the
AutoShapes menu of the Drawing toolbar. This includes AutoShapes from the
following submenus:
<P>
<PRE>   Connectors
   Basic Shapes
   Block Arrows
   Flowchart
   Stars and Banners
   Callouts

</PRE>NOTE: Not all of the Basic Shapes generate the error message.
