<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you open a text file located in a subdirectory
that is many levels deep, the second and third Text Import Wizard dialog
boxes contain a portion of the path name that is displayed in the first
Text Import Wizard dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs, for example, if you open the TEST.TXT file located in
C:\EXCEL\MYFILES\SUBFILES\MORFILES\DEEP\DEEPER\DEEPEST. When you open the
file, the Text Import Wizard - Step 1 of 3 dialog box appears and displays
the name of the text file, including the entire path. If the path name is
very long, the text runs off the right edge of the dialog box. When you
choose Next, the Text Import Wizard - Step 2 of 3 dialog box appears. This
second dialog box does not display the name of the text file; however, a
portion of the filename from the previous dialog box appears on the right
edge of the dialog box.
<P>
Note that this behavior is only a screen display problem and does not
affect the functionality of the TextWizard.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel version 5.0c.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0c, when you open a text file that is located
in a subdirectory many levels deep, the path listed in the Text Import
Wizard - Step 1 of 3 dialog box is shortened [it uses ellipsis points (...)
to indicate that some of the path has been omitted]; this way, the filename
does not extend beyond the right edge of the dialog box.
