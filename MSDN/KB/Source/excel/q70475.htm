The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 3.0, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The INDIRECT function can be used to prevent Microsoft Excel from
changing references on a dependent worksheet when columns or rows are
added or deleted from the source worksheet. This may be desired if you
bring version 2.x files into version 3.0 or 4.0 and want the worksheet
to behave in the same manner as in Microsoft Excel 2.x.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, linked references on the
dependent worksheet were static and would not change regardless of
what changes were made to the source worksheet. To work around this in
Microsoft Excel version 2.x, you need to use defined names in your
link. In Microsoft Excel version 3.0, the linking feature has been
enhanced to be more dynamic. Microsoft Excel version 3.0 assumes that
if you link to a particular cell on a worksheet, you will want to
maintain this relationship even if the linked cell has been affected
by the addition or deletion of cells. Microsoft Excel version 3.0 does
this by using a table of named ranges on the source document.
<P>
To illustrate this, assume the following formula is located on
SHEET2.XLS:
<P>
<PRE>   A1:  =SHEET1.XLS!$A$1

</PRE>If row 1 on SHEET1.XLS is highlighted and deleted, the formula on
SHEET2.XLS remains unchanged in Microsoft Excel version 2.x. In
Microsoft Excel version 3.0, the same formula reads:
<P>
<PRE>   A1:  =SHEET1.XLS!#REF!

</PRE>Because Microsoft Excel version 3.0 uses named ranges rather than cell
references, after the deletion, the cell no longer exists. This
results in a #REF error.
<P>
To bypass this new feature of Microsoft Excel version 3.0, the
following formula can be substituted:
<P>
<PRE>   A1:  =INDIRECT("sheet1.xls!$a$1")

</PRE>Because the reference is a text string rather than a reference, it
will not update when the row is deleted. Rather, it will return the
value that is now in cell A1 on SHEET1.XLS.
