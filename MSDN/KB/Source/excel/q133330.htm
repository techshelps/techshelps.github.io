The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install the Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 File Converter using the alternate
installation method, WK4INIUP.EXE, you may still receive the following
error message when you try to open Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 files:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot open Lotus 123 4.x file

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In certain network configurations, the WK4INIUP.EXE program will not
properly decompress the filter file, XLCONVW4.DLL. To check to see if the
file is properly expanded, check the file size of the XLCONVW4.DLL file.
This file is typically in the Excel directory. You can open the EXCEL5.INI
to determine the location of the filter. Once the WK4INIUP has been run,
the EXCEL5.INI will contain a line that will look something like this:
<P>
<PRE>   [Converters]
   conv2=Lotus 1-2-3 Release 4 or 5 (*.wk4),C:\EXCEL\XLCONVW4.DLL,*.wk4

</PRE>Look in the directory indicated on this line (in this case, "C:\EXCEL")
and compare the file size of XLCONVW4.DLL to the file sizes listed below:
<P>
<PRE>   XLCONVW4.DLL
   Compressed Size:     31,798
   Decompressed Size:   59,952

</PRE>If the file size is 31,798 bytes, it will need to be decompressed before it
will function properly.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To decompress this file, use one of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1: Use the DECOMP.EXE file decompression utility to decompress the
<PRE>          file as follows:

          a. Locate the file DECOMP.EXE on disk 1 of the Microsoft Excel
             5.0 or 5.0a disks, or on disk 1 of the Microsoft Office 4.2 or
             4.3 disks, and copy the file to the Windows directory.

             NOTE: This utility is not shipped with Microsoft Excel 5.0c or
             Microsoft Office versions 4.2c or 4.3c.

          b. In the network installation directory for the converter,
             rename the file XLCONVW4.DL_ to XLCONVW4.BAK.

          c. At the MS-DOS prompt, change to the network installation
             directory for the converter.

          d. Decompress the file using the following command:

                DECOMP.EXE XLCONVW4.BAK XLCONVW4.DL_

          The WK4INIUP.EXE installation program will now function properly.

</PRE>Method 2: If the DECOMP.EXE file is not available, you can get an expanded
<PRE>          version of the XLCONVW4.DLL by running the SETUP.EXE program that
          is included with the converter.

          NOTE: This method requires a local (non-network) installation of
          Microsoft Excel 5.0.

          a. On a system with Microsoft Excel installed locally, run the
             SETUP.EXE installation program from the network converter
             installation directory.

             This will install the XLCONVW4.DLL to the local Microsoft
             Excel directory.

          b. In the network converter installation directory, rename the
             file XLCONVW4.DL_ to XLCONVW4.BAK.

          c. Copy the XLCONVW4.DLL to the network converter installation
             directory and rename it XLCONVW4.DL_.

          The WK4INIUP.EXE installation program will now function properly.
