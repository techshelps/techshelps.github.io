SUMMARY
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you save unwanted changes to a file, you may be
able to recover the original file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you save changes a Microsoft Excel file, the following occurs:

<UL><LI>The changed file is saved to a temporary file.

<LI>The original file is deleted.

<LI>The temporary file is renamed to the original file name.
<P>
</UL>For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q103329.htm">Q103329</A></B>
   TITLE     : Excel: Temporary File Created When You Save a Document

</PRE>The deleted original file is located in the same directory or folder as
the newly modified file in Windows. On the Macintosh, temporary files
are placed in an invisible folder called Temporary Items in the root
level of the hard disk.
<P>
WARNING: Microsoft does not guarantee that any deleted Microsoft Excel
file can be recovered, or if recovered, that the file will be reliable.
<P>
The method that you use to recover a deleted file is dependent on the
operating system that you are using. To recover a deleted file, you need
a utility program to accomplish the task.
<P>
MS-DOS, versions 6.0 and later, ships with a utility called Undelete,
which you can use to recover deleted files. However, the following
operating systems do not ship with a utility to recover deleted files:
<P>
<PRE>   MS-DOS 5.0 and earlier
   Macintosh (all Systems)
   Windows NT
   Windows 95

</PRE>Windows NT does not allow deleted files to be recovered, and therefore,
no undelete utilities are available.
<P>
Third-party programs are available that can recover deleted files.
<P>
For more information about undeleting files, consult the manual included
with your operating system or your undelete utility.
<P>
The probability that you will have success in recovering a deleted file
depends on the amount of disk activity that has taken place since the
file has been deleted. In general, you have a better chance of
recovering a deleted file if you attempt to undelete it immediately
after the file is deleted.
