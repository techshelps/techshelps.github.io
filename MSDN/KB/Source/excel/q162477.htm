<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a PivotTable, Microsoft Excel may incorrectly calculate the grand total
for a calculated field.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you use a calculated field (a field based on other
fields) in a PivotTable, and the calculated field is defined by performing
a higher order arithmetic operation, such as exponentiation, multiplication
or division, on other fields in the PivotTable. For example, this problem
occurs when you use a calculated field named Revenues that returns the
multiple of the fields Units*Price. The individual items in the calculated
field return the expected results; however, the grand total does not return
the expected result for the calculated field.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a calculated field includes more than one field in the data range,
Microsoft Excel computes the grand total for the sum of each component
field, and then performs the arithmetic operation. For example, the
following example PivotTable contains a calculated field named Revenue,
which is defined as Price * Units.
<P>
<PRE>   A1: Sum of Revenue  B1:           C1:         D1:
   A2: Product         B2: Units     C2: Price   D2: Total
   A3: Alpha           B3: 1         C3: 10      D3: 10
   A4:                 B4: 1 Total   C4:         D4: 10
   A5: Alpha Total     B5:           C5:         D5: 10
   A6: Bravo           B6: 2         C6: 11      D6: 22
   A7:                 B7: 2 Total   C7:         D7: 22
   A8: Bravo Total     B8:           C8:         D8: 22
   A9: Charlie         B9: 3         C9: 12      D9: 36
   A10:               B10: 3 Total  C10:        D10: 36
   A11: Charlie Total B11:          C11:        D11: 36
   A12: Grand Total   B12:          C12:        D12: 198

</PRE>The grand total of 198 does not equal the subtotals of 10+22+36, which is
68. Microsoft Excel computes the grand totals for the calculated field
Revenues as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   SUM(Units)*SUM(Price)

   or

   SUM(1+2+3)*SUM(10+11+12)

</PRE>which is 6*33=198.
