The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, if you insert a movie object into
a worksheet, the following problems may occur when you play the movie:

<UL><LI>If you switch to another worksheet, the movie object appears in that
   worksheet, and the movie continues to play. When the movie stops
   playing, the worksheet contains an image of the movie that cannot be
   selected or removed.

<LI>If you hide the worksheet that contains the movie object by pointing to
   Sheet on the Format menu, and clicking Hide, the movie object appears in
   the newly-active worksheet and the movie continues to play. When the
   movie stops playing, the worksheet contains an image of the movie that
   cannot be selected or removed.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur because Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition does not
deactivate playing movie objects when you switch from one worksheet to
another.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, stop playing the movie before you switch to
another worksheet.
<P>
To remove the image of a movie from a worksheet, switch to another
worksheet. When you switch back to the worksheet in which the image of the
movie appeared, the image is no longer there.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
