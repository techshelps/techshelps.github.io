The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In versions of Microsoft Excel that are earlier than Microsoft Excel 97,
text files that contain more than 16,384 rows cannot be opened in their
entirety. You cannot open these files because earlier versions of Microsoft
Excel are limited to 16,384 rows. If you open a file that contains more
data than this, the following error message appears
<P>
<PRE>   File not loaded completely

</PRE>and the text file is truncated at the row 16,384. However, you can use a
macro to open the file and automatically break the text into multiple
worksheets.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft Excel 97 has a limit of 65,536 rows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following sample macro prompts you for a text filename, then opens the
file into memory. If the number of rows is larger than the Microsoft Excel
worksheet limit of 16,384, the macro breaks the file into multiple
worksheets. This macro applies only to files you saved as text files and
does not apply to any other file formats. The macro will not work with
database file formats.
<P>
Note that because this is a macro, using it may be significantly slower
than clicking Open on the File menu.

   End Sub

</PRE>NOTE: The macro does not parse the data into columns. After using the
macro, you may also need to use the Text To Columns command on the Data
menu to parse the data as needed.
<P>
When you run this macro on a Macintosh, and you are attempting to open a
file that is on the desktop, the file name must be preceded by the
following
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Hard disk&gt;:Desktop Folder:

</PRE>where &lt;Hard disk&gt; is the name of your hard disk. Note that there is a space
between the words Desktop and Folder.
