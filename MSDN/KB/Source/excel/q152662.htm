The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel,
   version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information describes the system requirements for installing
the Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel (SBFM).
It also describes known limitations in the application as well as known
issues with third-party accounting programs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The minimum system requirements for the Microsoft Small Business Financial
Manager for Microsoft Excel are as follows:

<UL><LI>A personal computer with a 386DX or higher processor (486 recommended)
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 operating system or a Microsoft Windows NT
   workstation operating system version 3.51 or later (will not run on
   earlier versions of Windows)
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95 (will not run on earlier versions of
   Microsoft Excel)
<LI>8 megabytes (MB) of memory for use on Windows 95; 14 MB of memory for
   use on a Windows NT workstation
<LI>Hard disk space required: 10 MB available (excludes requirements for
   Microsoft Excel for Windows 95)
<LI>One 3.5-inch high-density disk drive
<LI>VGA or higher resolution video adapter (SVGA 256-color recommended)
<LI>Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device
<LI>Accounting data from a system supported by the Microsoft Small Business
   Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel
<P>
</UL>The available setup options allow you to choose which accounting systems
you will be using with SBFM. To save hard disk space, select only those
systems that you need.
<P>
<P><h3>If You Have a Previous Version of Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel Setup
installs a shortcut on your desktop to start Microsoft Excel for Windows
95. If you have a previous version of Microsoft Excel on your computer in
addition to Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, the Microsoft Small Business
Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel shortcut starts the last installed
version of Microsoft Excel. If the shortcut opens a version of Microsoft
Excel other than Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, reinstall Microsoft Excel
for Windows 95, then reinstall Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager
for Windows 95. You do not need to remove your previous version of
Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h3>If You Have a Network Version of Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot install the Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for
Microsoft Excel if you are using a version of Microsoft Excel that is run
from the network. You must have Microsoft Excel installed locally on your
computer before you can install the Microsoft Small Business Financial
Manager. If you are running the network version of Microsoft Excel, you may
have problems installing the Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager.
<P>
Though Setup does not include a special network setup mode, you can
distribute the Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for Microsoft
Excel over a network (provided you have obtained the appropriate license to
do so). To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the network server, create a folder called SBFM.

<P><LI>In the SBFM folder, create three folders and name them Disk1, Disk2
   and Disk3.
<P>
   The new folders should resemble the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;drive:&gt;\SBFM\Disk1
      &lt;drive:&gt;\SBFM\Disk2
      &lt;drive:&gt;\SBFM\Disk3
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive:&gt; is the letter of the network drive.

<P><LI>Copy the contents of each of the Setup disks to the appropriate folder
   on the network server (that is, copy the contents of Disk 1 to the Disk1
   folder, and so on).

<P><LI>Once the disk contents are copied to their respective folders on the
   network, start the Setup program from the desired workstation. Note that
   each workstation must have a local installation of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
</OL><h3>Installing Microsoft Access 2.0 After SBFM</h3>
 
<P>
If you are going to install Microsoft Access 2.0 on your computer and you
have already installed Financial Manager, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Uninstall SBFM.

<P><LI>Install Microsoft Access for Windows, version 2.0.

<P><LI>Re-install the Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for Microsoft
   Excel.
<P>
</OL>If you do not follow these steps you will encounter errors and instability
when you create reports or what-if analyses.
<P>
<P><h3>Special Instructions on Types of Accounting Data You Can Import</h3>
 
<P>
Accounting data created by Simply Accounting  for Windows. You cannot
import a database into Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for
Microsoft Excel if it's concurrently open in Simply Accounting. Before you
use the Import Wizard to import or update a database, verify that the
database isn't already in use by Simply Accounting; if it is, close it.
<P>
Accounting data created by Great Plains Accounting for DOS. If you copy
Great Plains accounting data from another computer to use with the
Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel, you must
copy the entire data directory and any subdirectories intact. Otherwise the
Microsoft Small Business Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel may not be
able to locate the accounting data once you've copied it, because Great
Plains points to data in specific directories.
<P>
Accounting data created by Peachtree Complete Accounting for DOS. Peachtree
maintains two master files, SYSCOMP.D@@ and SYSCOMP.K@@, that contain the
names and locations of all your accounting data files. Peachtree places
these master files in the same folder as the Peachtree program files,
instead of in the same directory as your accounting data. The Microsoft
Small Business Financial Manager for Microsoft Excel can't locate your
accounting data without these master files. If you don't have the Peachtree
software on your computer, and you want to import Peachtree accounting data
that was created on another computer, be sure to copy not just the
accounting data from the other computer, but the two SYSCOMP master files
from the Peachtree program folder as well.
<P>
Accounting data created by Peachtree for Windows version 3.0. You can't
import a database into the Microsoft  Small Business Financial Manager for
Microsoft Excel if it's concurrently open in Peachtree for Windows. Before
you use the Import Wizard to import or update a database, verify that the
database isn't already in use by Peachtree for Windows; if it is, close it.
<P>
Accounting data created by Quickbooks, you must have Quickbooks installed
on your computer, and the company .QBW file to import must be in the same
folder as the Quickbooks program files.
