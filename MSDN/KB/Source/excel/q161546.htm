The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, all currently open documents use the same mode of
calculation, regardless of the mode in which they have been saved.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To help explain how the mode of calculation is determined, this
article refers to the following hypothetical documents:
<P>
<PRE>                                      Saved with this
   File name      Type of document    mode of calculation
   ------------------------------------------------------

   Auto1.xls      Workbook            Automatic
   Manual1.xls    Workbook            Manual
   Auto2.xls      Workbook            Automatic


</PRE>The following statements apply to calculation modes in Microsoft
Excel:

<UL><LI>The first document opened uses the calculation mode with which it
   was last saved. Subsequently-opened documents use the same mode.
<P>
   For example, if you open Auto1.xls and then open Manual1.xls,
   both documents will use automatic calculation (the mode used by
   Auto1.xls). If you open Manual1.xls and then open Auto1.xls,
   both documents will use manual calculation.

<LI>Changing the calculation mode of one open document changes the mode
   for all open documents.
<P>
   If Auto1.xls and Auto2.xls are both open, changing the calculation
   mode of Auto2.xls to manual also changes the mode of Auto1.xls to
   manual.

<LI>All sheets contained in a workbook use the same mode of calculation.
<P>
   If Auto2.xls contains three worksheets, changing the mode of
   calculation of the first worksheet to manual also changes the mode of
   calculation to manual in the other two sheets.

<LI>If all other documents are closed and you create a new document, the
   new document uses the same calculation mode as the previously closed
   documents. However, if you use a template, the mode of calculation is
   the mode that is specified in the template.

<LI>If the mode of calculation in a workbook has changed, and the file is
   saved, the current mode of calculation is saved.
<P>
   If Auto1.xls is opened, Manual1.xls is opened, and Manual1.xls is
   immediately saved, the mode of calculation is saved as Automatic.
<P>
</UL><h3>Controlling the Mode of Calculation</h3>
 
<P>
All open documents use the same mode of calculation. You must follow
special procedures to work with documents that use different calculation
modes. For example, if you are working with Auto1.xls and you want to
open Manual1.xls in manual calculation mode, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Set Auto1.xls to manual calculation mode before you open Manual1.xls.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Close Auto1.xls (and any other open documents) before you open
   Manual1.xls.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are four modes of calculation in Microsoft Excel: Automatic,
Automatic Except Tables, Manual, and Recalculate Before Save.
<P>
<PRE>   For this mode          Recalculation occurs when
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   Automatic              You make any change to the document. All
                          affected parts of the document are
                          recalculated.

   Automatic              You make any change to the document. All
   except tables          affected parts of the document EXCEPT TABLES
                          are recalculated. A table is recalculated
                          only when a change is made to it.

   Manual                 You press the F9 key, click Options on the
                          Tools menu, click the Calculation tab, and
                          click the Calc Sheet button.

   Manual /               You press F9, or click Calc Sheet on the
     Recalculate before   Calculation tab on the Tools/Options menu, as
     Save                 well as every time you save the file.
