The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.x, 4.x, 5.x

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how the automatic minimum and maximum limits for
chart axis scales are computed in different versions of Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the following examples, the following names are used to describe 
certain values.
<P>
<PRE>   Name   Description
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   yMax   The maximum y value used in your chart.

   yMin   The minimum y value used in your chart.

   xMax   The maximum x value used in your chart. This applies only to
          charts that use x values, such as scatter and bubble charts.

   xMin   The minimum x value used in your chart. This applies only to
          charts that use x values, such as scatter and bubble charts.

</PRE>When you create a chart in Microsoft Excel, there are three possible 
scenarios that may apply to your data:

<UL><LI>The yMax and yMin values are both non-negative (greater than or equal
   to zero). This is Scenario One.

<LI>The yMax and yMin values are both non-positive (less than or equal to
   zero). This is Scenario Two.

<LI>The yMax value is positive, and the yMin value is negative. This is
   Scenario Three.
<P>
</UL>The major unit used by the y-axis is automatically determined by Microsoft 
Excel, based on all of the data included in the chart. The following 
scenarios use this default major unit.
<P>
<P><h3>Scenario 1: Microsoft Excel 97 and Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97 and Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, the 
following applies:

<UL><LI>If the chart is a 2-D area, column, bar, line or x-y scatter chart, 
   the automatic maximum for the y-axis is the first major unit greater
   than or equal to the value returned by the following equation:
<P>
<P><PRE>      yMax + 0.05 * ( yMax - yMin )
</PRE><P>
   Otherwise, the automatic maximum for the y-axis is the first major unit 
   greater than or equal to yMax.

<LI>If the difference between yMax and yMin is greater than 16.667
   percent of the value of yMax, the automatic minimum for the y-axis is 
   zero.

<LI>If the difference between yMax and yMin is less than 16.667 percent of 
   the value of yMax, the automatic minimum for the y-axis is the first 
   major unit less than or equal to the value returned by the following 
   equation:
<P>
<P><PRE>      yMin - ( ( yMax - yMin ) / 2 )
</PRE><P>
   Exception: If the chart is an x-y scatter or bubble chart, the 
   automatic minimum for the y-axis is the first major unit less than or 
   equal to yMin.
<P>
</UL><h3>Scenario 1: All Earlier Versions of Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
In all earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, the following applies:

<UL><LI>The automatic maximum for the y-axis is the first major unit greater
   than or equal to yMax.

<LI>If the difference between yMax and yMin is greater than 16.667
   percent of the value of yMax, the automatic minimum for the y-axis is 
   zero.

<LI>If the difference between yMax and yMin is less than 16.667 percent of 
   the value of yMax, the automatic minimum for the y-axis is the first 
   major unit less than or equal to the value returned by the following 
   equation:
<P>
<P><PRE>      yMin - ( ( yMax - yMin ) / 2 )
</PRE><P>
   Exception: If the chart is an x-y scatter or bubble chart, the 
   automatic minimum for the y-axis is the first major unit less than or 
   equal to yMin.
<P>
</UL><h3>Scenario 2: Microsoft Excel 97 and Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97 and Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, the 
following applies:

<UL><LI>If the chart is a 2-D area, column, bar, line or x-y scatter chart,
   the automatic minimum for the y-axis is the first major unit less than
   or equal to the value returned by the following equation:
<P>
<P><PRE>      yMin + 0.05 * ( yMin - yMax )
</PRE><P>
   Otherwise, the automatic minimum for the y-axis is the first major unit 
   less than or equal to yMin.

<LI>If the difference between yMax and yMin is greater than 16.667
   percent of the value of yMin, the automatic maximum for the y-axis is 
   zero.

<LI>If the difference between yMax and yMin is less than 16.667 percent of 
   the value of yMin, the automatic maximum for the y-axis is the first 
   major unit greater than or equal to the value returned by the following 
   equation:
<P>
<P><PRE>      yMax - ( ( yMin - yMax ) / 2 )
</PRE><P>
   Exception: If the chart is an x-y scatter or bubble chart, the 
   automatic maximum for the y-axis is the first major unit greater than 
   or equal to yMax.
<P>
</UL><h3>Scenario 2: All Earlier Versions of Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
In all earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, the following applies:

<UL><LI>The automatic minimum for the y-axis is the first major unit less than
   or equal to yMin.

<LI>If the difference between yMax and yMin is greater than 16.667
   percent of the value of yMin, the automatic maximum for the y-axis is 
   zero.

<LI>If the difference between yMax and yMin is less than 16.667 percent of 
   the value of yMin, the automatic maximum for the y-axis is the first 
   major unit greater than or equal to the value returned by the following 
   equation:
<P>
<P><PRE>      yMax - ( ( yMin - yMax ) / 2 )
</PRE><P>
   Exception: If the chart is an x-y scatter or bubble chart, the 
   automatic maximum for the y-axis is the first major unit greater than 
   or equal to yMax.
<P>
</UL><h3>Scenario 3: Microsoft Excel 97 and Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97 and Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, the 
following applies:

<UL><LI>The automatic maximum for the y-axis is the first major unit greater
   than or equal to the value returned by the following equation:
<P>
<P><PRE>      yMax + 0.05 * ( yMax - yMin )
</PRE>
<LI>The automatic minimum for the y-axis is the first major unit less than
   or equal to the value returned by the following equation:
<P>
<P><PRE>      yMin + 0.05 * ( yMin - yMax )
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>Scenario 3: All Earlier Versions of Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
In all earlier versions of Microsoft Excel, the following applies:

<UL><LI>The automatic maximum for the y-axis is the first major unit greater
   than or equal to yMax.

<LI>The automatic minimum for the y-axis is the first major unit less than
   or equal to yMin.
<P>
</UL><h3>X-axis Limitations</h3>
 
<P>
The above information also applies to charts that use x values, such as x-y 
scatter charts and bubble charts. For these types of charts, substitute 
xMax and xMin for yMax and yMin in the above scenarios.
