WARNING: The information in this article has not been confirmed or tested
by Microsoft. Some or all of the information in this article has been
taken from unconfirmed customer reports. ANY USE BY YOU OF THE INFORMATION
PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this
information "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or

<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you point to Send To on the File menu, and then click Mail Recipient,
you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot load the mail service. Check your mail installation.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive this error message if you had the "Lotus VIM Mail Support"
setup option selected when you ran the Office Setup program.
<P>
NOTE: The "Lotus VIM Mail Support" setup option is a sub-component of the
"Office Tools" option.
<P>
The Microsoft Office 97 Setup program is incorrectly writing a key to the
Windows registry and Microsoft Excel 97 is supposed to ignore this key if
it exists.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys
And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that
you should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and
User.dat) before you edit the registry.
<P>
To prevent this error from occurring, remove the following key from the
Windows registry:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common\MapiDLL

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange (or other mail system compatible with the Messaging
   Application Programming Interface [MAPI]).

   Messaging [VIM]).
<P>
</UL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
