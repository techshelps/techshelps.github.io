                      Questions and Answers: Workbook
               --------------------------------------------

1. Q. How can I take advantage of Microsoft Excel version 4.0's workbooks?

   A. Microsoft Excel 4.0 includes a new feature called Workbooks.
      Workbooks allow you to assemble files together into one working unit,
      so that by opening the workbook file, you will have access to all the
      files in that workbook. Excel 4.0 workbooks have many of the features
      of Excel 3.0 workspace files, but with added functionality.

      To create a workbook, follow these three steps:

      a. From the File menu, choose New.

      b. In the New box, select Workbook.

      c. Click the OK button.

      At this point, Microsoft Excel 4.0 will open a new workbook window.
      You may add files to the workbook by clicking the Add button at the
      bottom of the window. If you already have some files made that you
      want to add, click the Open button and choose your file. If you want
      to add a new file, click the New button, and choose the file type you
      want to add.

      To save the workbook, choose Save Workbook from the File menu. Type
      in a filename for the workbook, and click the Save button.

      If you want to change the name of any of the files within a workbook,
      select the file while in the workbook window, and click the Options
      button at the bottom of the window. Then enter the new name for the
      file and choose whether the file should be bound or unbound to the
      workbook. The default in most situations will be bound, meaning that
      the file will be stored as part of the workbook file on disk. By
      choosing unbound, the file will be saved as a separate file from the
      workbook, although whenever you open the workbook, that file will
      still be opened. The main advantage to having a file unbound is when
      transferring a file to another computer without having to take the
      entire workbook file.

      To open a file that is already in a workbook, double-click the file
      in the workbook window. In the lower-right corner of the window, you
      will notice three icons. Click the left-most icon, to return to
      viewing the workbook window, so that you may see all of the files and
      open the one of your choice. By clicking the other two icons, you
      will cycle through the available worksheets, macros, and charts that
      are in the workbook.

      For more information, see Book 1, Chapter 4, pages 13 to 20, of the
      "Microsoft Excel User's Guide."

2. Q. How do I create a workbook out of some files that I have already
      created?

   A. To create a new workbook, yet use files that you have created in the
      past, follow these four steps:

      a. Create a new workbook by choosing New from the File menu. Choose
         Workbook, and click the OK button.

      b. Click the Add button in the lower-left corner of the new Workbook
         window.

      c. Excel will display a dialog box allowing you to select a currently
         open file, a new file, or a previously created file. To add a file
         that you have stored on a disk but that is not currently open,
         click the Open button.

      d. Excel will display a standard Open dialog box. Move to the folder
         where you have stored your file, select it, and click the Open
         button. You may perform steps 3 and 4 as many times as you need to
         add all of your files.

3. Q. How can I see more than one file at a time in my workbook?

   A. When working with workbooks, Excel will usually display only one
      workbook item at a time. You do have the option of showing more than
      one at a time. To show two items at once, follow these five steps:

      a. Open the workbook and go to the Workbook Contents page. To display
         the Workbook Contents page, click the left-most icon of the three
         that are located in the lower-right corner of the workbook window.

      b. Hold down the COMMAND key and double-click the name of one of the
         files you want to view.

      c. Select the workbook name from the Window menu.

      d. Hold down the COMMAND key and double-click the name of the second
         document you want to view.

      e. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have opened all the files you
         want to see.

      To arrange the document windows neatly on the screen, use the
      following three steps:

      a. From the Window menu, choose the workbook name.

      b. From the Window menu, choose Arrange.

      c. Choose the arrangement method that you prefer, and select the
         "Documents of Active Workbook" option by clicking the check box.
         Click the OK button.

      Excel 4.0 will then neatly arrange all of the open workbook documents
      on your screen.
