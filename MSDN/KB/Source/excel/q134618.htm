The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you save a shared file, you may receive the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Save resulted in some changes from other users

</PRE>When you choose OK, the file you are editing may not display any changes.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when another person adds a formula to a shared file
and saves the file while you are editing the same file. For example, if
another person opens the shared file you currently have open, adds the
formula =SUM(A1:A4) to cell A5 on the worksheet that you are editing, and
then saves the file, you receive the message described above when you save
the file; note, however, that the change to cell A5 does not appear on the
worksheet that you are editing.
<P>
This behavior occurs because although formulas are not saved in shared
workbooks, Microsoft Excel determines that another person made a change
to the file and informs you of this change, even though the change is not
saved. Note that this behavior does not affect the functionality of the
shared file. However, it may be confusing if you notice that no changes
appear in the file after you receive this message.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you add a formula to a shared workbook, you receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   New or copied formulas cannot be saved while the file is being shared.
   Show this message in the future?

</PRE>When you save the file, the formula still appears on the worksheet on
your computer. However, the change does not appear in the worksheet on any
other computer where the shared file is currently open. Additionally, when
you close and then open the shared workbook again, the formula no longer
appears.
<P>
