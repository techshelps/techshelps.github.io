The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article,
if you open a file that has already been opened by another user, you may
NOT receive the following alert message
<P>
<PRE>   '&lt;File.xls&gt;' is being modified by

   &lt;Another User's Name&gt;

   Open as Read-Only, or choose Notify to be alerted when it is
   available.

</PRE>where &lt;File.xls&gt; is the name of the file and &lt;Another User's Name&gt; is the
name of the user who has opened the file.
<P>
Instead, Microsoft Excel opens the file as read-only without displaying the
alert message and the Notify button.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The file is saved in the Microsoft Excel 4.0 Worksheet format.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The file is stored on a Microsoft Windows NT server that is running
   Services for Macintosh (SFM) or File Server for Macintosh.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE><P>
  - The file is opened by a user who is running Microsoft Excel for
<P><PRE>    Windows. The file is then opened by a user who is running Microsoft
    Excel for the Macintosh.
</PRE><P>
</UL>NOTE: This problem does not occur if the file is saved in the workbook
format for Microsoft Excel version 5.0 or later. This problem does not
occur if the file is first opened in Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh and
then opened in Microsoft Excel for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, convert the Microsoft Excel 4.0 Worksheet
format files to a later format. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel, open the file.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As. In the list of file types, select a
   workbook format for Microsoft Excel 5.0 (or later).

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>After you save the file, click Close on the File menu.
<P>
</OL>Repeat these steps for each file that you want to convert.
<P>
NOTE: If anyone on your organization is still using Microsoft Excel 4.0, do
not convert your files to a later format. Microsoft Excel 4.0 cannot open
files stored in later formats.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
