<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, you can copy a worksheet by using the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the worksheet you want to copy. Then, click "Move or Copy Sheet"
   on the Edit menu. Or, right-click the sheet tab of the worksheet you
   want to copy, and then click Move Or Copy on the shortcut menu.

<P><LI>In the Move Or Copy dialog box, click to select the Create A Copy check
   box. In the To Book list, click a destination workbook for the copied
   worksheet. Specify the destination location for the copied worksheet
   in the Before Sheet list.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>The three possible settings for objects in worksheets in Microsoft Excel
are listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   Setting             Definition
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Show All            All objects are displayed normally.

   Show Placeholders   Objects are displayed in gray; you can see the
                       shape of the object but not its contents.

   Hide All            Objects are not displayed.

</PRE></OL>All worksheets in a workbook use the same settings. You can change these
settings for the active workbook by clicking Options on the Tools menu and
selecting the View tab.
<P>
If you copy a worksheet in Microsoft Excel 97, the Objects setting for the
destination workbook is automatically reset to Show All regardless of its
previous setting.
<P>
In addition, if the setting of the copied worksheet is Hide All, and you
copy the worksheet in a single workbook, objects in the original worksheet
may not be visible even though the setting for the workbook is Show All. If
this behavior occurs, use the second method in this article to restore the
objects on the worksheet to the normal behavior.
