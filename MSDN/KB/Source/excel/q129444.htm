<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you click the "Allow Multi-User Editing" check box
on the Editing tab of the Shared Lists dialog box, the Save As dialog box
may appear with Microsoft Excel Workbook as the only option listed in the
Save As Type box.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you click the "Allow Multi-User Editing" check
box in a workbook that has not been saved or that is saved in a file
format other than Microsoft Excel workbook. This behavior is by design,
because you cannot share a file in Microsoft Excel unless it is saved in
the Microsoft Excel workbook file format. Additionally, you cannot save a
file in Microsoft Excel to a file format other than Microsoft Excel
workbook and still maintain the Allow Multi-User Editing feature.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q129993.htm">Q129993</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL7: Save As Dialog Saves File Without Multi-User Editing

</PRE>When you click the "Allow Multi-User Editing" check box in a Microsoft
Excel workbook file, you receive a dialog box with the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   This operation will result in a save. Continue?

</PRE>When you choose OK, the file is saved again as a Microsoft Excel workbook,
and the Multi-User Editing feature is enabled.
<P>
However, when you click the "Allow Multi-User Editing" check box in a file
that has not been saved or in a file that has been saved in a file format
other than Microsoft Excel Workbook, the Save As dialog box appears as
described above. If you do not save the file as a Microsoft Excel workbook
file, the Multi-User Editing feature is not enabled for the file.
