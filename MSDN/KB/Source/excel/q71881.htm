The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 2.x, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for OS/2, versions 2.2, 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When using a data form to edit a database, Microsoft Excel will not allow
you to edit any items that were entered into the database in the ="&lt;text&gt;"
format. The entry will be displayed in the data form, but cannot be edited.
This is also true for custom data forms.
<P>
<P><h3>Examples</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Zip codes or other numbers that need leading zeros and were entered
   as ="02345"

<LI>Part numbers or building numbers entered as ="3-5" (so that the entry
   is not calculated as a date).
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel assumes that the field is a calculated field (because of
the equal sign) and will display the item, but does not allow you to edit
the entry.
<P>
It is also possible that, if Alternate Navigation Keys has been checked
(under Workspace from the Options menu), the item might have been entered
as '02345 (equivalent to ="02345") to enter the item as text. If the item
was this way, Microsoft Excel will display the item in a data form and
allow editing of this field. Editing the field does not work properly,
however. If you edit it by entering '02346, Microsoft Excel will display
the ' in the cell. If you edit it by entering 02346, Microsoft Excel will
drop the leading zero in the cell.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
The best workaround is to use a custom dialog box. There is no way to
properly edit these types of entries in a data form (custom or default).
<P>
In the example that uses zip codes, the best workaround is to enter the
number without the leading zero and use the Number option from the Format
menu to display the value correctly in the cell. For example, choose Number
from the Format menu and type "00000" (without the quotation marks) in the
Format box.
