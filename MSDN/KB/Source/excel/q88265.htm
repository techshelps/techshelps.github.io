<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Below is the contents of the README--NETWORK which is located on the
Disk 1-Setup diskette and is also placed in the folder to which
Microsoft Excel is installed. The text describes various
considerations when installing or using Excel 4.0 for the Macintosh in
a networked environment.

Optimizing System Software Version 7.0 for Installing and Using
Applications
 
 
<P>
If you use system software version 7.0 in a networked environment, you
should consider installing the System 7 Tune-Up utility. This will
improve installation and general performance times of your
applications. To obtain the current version of this utility, contact
your Apple dealer or Macintosh user group.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Setting Up Microsoft Excel on a Network</h3>
 
<P>
You can install Microsoft Excel for a network using either of two
methods. One method allows network users to install and run Microsoft
Excel on their local workstations -- a convenient alternative to
installing from floppy disks. The other method sets up network users'
local workstations so they can run Microsoft Excel from the server --
useful if workstation disk space is a concern. In either case, setting
up Microsoft Excel on a network is a two-step process: first install
Microsoft Excel on the network server; then set up the workstations.
<P>
Before you set up Microsoft Excel, the network must be operational,
and you must have read-write access to the network folder in which you
want to install Microsoft Excel. For more information, see your
network software documentation.
<P>
Each workstation should have at least 2 MB of RAM in order to run the
Microsoft Excel program.
<P>
This document assumes that you know how to use network software to
connect to network drives and how to find files stored on network
computers.
<P>
Note: Every Microsoft Excel user must have a Microsoft Excel license.
A license is obtained by buying a retail package or a Microsoft
License Pack. For more information on network use restrictions, see
your Microsoft Excel license agreement.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Microsoft Excel on a Server</h3>
 
<P>
Before installing Microsoft Excel on a workstation, you must install
it on the network server.
<P>
<P>
To install so others can install Microsoft Excel from the server:

<OL><P><LI>Insert Disk 1-Setup in the server's floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Excel folder, double-click the Microsoft Excel
   Setup icon.

<P><LI>Type your name and the name of your organization, and then choose
   the OK button.
<P>
   Each name can be no longer than 31 characters.

<P><LI>On the next Setup screen, choose the OK button to verify the
   information.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE><P>
   Choose the Change button to return to the previous screen and make
   changes.
<P>
   Setup asks what type of installation you want to perform.

<P><LI>Choose the Network button and select the "Allow users to install
   from the server" option.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Choose the drive and folder you want to use as the server and
   choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Follow the remaining instructions on the screen.

<P><LI>When Setup is complete, choose the OK button to exit Setup.
<P>
<P>
</OL>To install so others can run Microsoft Excel from the server:

<OL><P><LI>Insert Disk 1-Setup in the server's floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Excel folder, double-click the Microsoft Excel
   Setup icon.

<P><LI>Type your name and the name of your organization, and then choose
   the OK button.
<P>
   Each name can be no longer than 31 characters.

<P><LI>On the next Setup screen, choose the OK button to verify the
   information.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE><P>
   Choose the Change button to return to the previous screen and make
   changes.
<P>
   Setup asks what type of installation you want to perform.

<P><LI>Choose the Network button and select the "Allow users to run
   Microsoft Excel from the server" option.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Choose the drive and folder you want to use as the server and
   choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Follow the remaining instructions on the screen.

<P><LI>When Setup is complete, choose the OK button to exit Setup.
<P>
<P>
</OL>Note: After installing Microsoft Excel on the server you should make
the Microsoft Excel folder read-only to prevent users from
unintentionally overwriting files. For more information, see your
operating system documentation.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Microsoft Excel on a Workstation</h3>
 
<P>
After installing Microsoft Excel on the network server, you can
install it on a workstation. You perform the following procedures from
the local workstation on which you are installing Microsoft Excel.
Before installing Microsoft Excel on any workstations, you must be in
compliance with the terms of your Microsoft Excel license agreement.
<P>
<P>
To install so Microsoft Excel runs from a local workstation:
<P>
This method of installation from a network server is a time-saving,
convenient alternative to installing Microsoft Excel from disks.
<P>
This procedure assumes you have completed the procedure, "To install
so others can install Microsoft Excel from the server," above.

<OL><P><LI>From the workstation, log on to the network and connect to the
   drive that contains the folder containing Microsoft Excel Setup.
<P>
   This is the same drive and folder in which you installed Microsoft
   Excel using the procedure, "To install so others can install Microsoft
   Excel from the server," above.

<P><LI>Double-click the Microsoft Excel Setup icon.

<P><LI>Type your name, and then choose the OK button.
<P>
   The name can be no longer than 31 characters.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button to verify the information.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE><P>
   Choose the Change button to return to the previous screen and make
   changes.

<P><LI>On the next Setup screen, choose the button that corresponds to the
   installation you want to perform: Complete, Custom, Minimum, or
   Network. (Choose the Network button only if you want to install
   Microsoft Excel on another network server.)

<P><LI>On the next Setup screen, choose the folder in which you want to
   install Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE><P>
   Choose the New Folder button, enter a name for the new folder, and
   choose the Create button.

<P><LI>Choose the Setup button.

<P><LI>When Setup is complete, choose the OK button to exit Setup.
<P>
<P>
</OL>To install so Microsoft Excel runs from a network server:
<P>
This procedure assumes you have completed the procedure, "To install
so others can run Microsoft Excel from the server," above.

<OL><P><LI>From the workstation, log on to the network and connect to the
   drive that contains the folder containing Microsoft Excel Setup.
<P>
   This is the same drive and folder in which you installed Microsoft
   Excel using the procedure, "To install so others can run Microsoft
   Excel from the server," above.

<P><LI>Double-click the Microsoft Excel Setup icon.
<P>

<P><LI>When Setup is complete, choose the OK button to exit Setup.
<P>
<P>
</OL> 
<P><h3>Using Microsoft Excel on a Network</h3>
 
<P>
Using Microsoft Excel on a network is essentially the same as using
Microsoft Excel from a hard disk on an individual computer. On the
network, you can make a document available to other users and allow
them to make changes to the file, or you can protect the file from
changes. You can use the network server to store and exchange
documents between users.
<P>
<P><h3>Sharing Documents on a Network</h3>
 
<P>
By linking a document on a workstation to a shared document on the
network, you can automatically update information in the workstation
document when it changes in the shared document. You can link
Microsoft Excel documents with each other and with documents created
in other applications such as Microsoft Word. For information, see
Chapter 3 in Book 2 of the Microsoft Excel User's Guide.
<P>
You can protect documents that are shared on a network from
unintentional changes. Such protection can be assigned at the system
or network level, and in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>System and Network Document Protections</h3>
 
<P>
At the system level, you can make a file read-only by choosing the Get
Info command from the File menu in the Finder and selecting the Locked
box. At the network (AppleShare) level, you can restrict access to a
single document or to all documents in a folder. For information about
how to assign access permissions, see your system documentation. For
example:

<UL><LI>To allow users to open a document and save changes to it, assign
   read-write permission for the document. The first user to open a
   document has control of the original until closing it; other users can
   open a copy of the document and save changes to it under a different
   name.

<LI>To allow users to open a document but not make changes to it under the
   current name, assign read-only access for the document.

<LI>To prevent changes to all documents in a folder, assign read-only
   access for the folder.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h3>Microsoft Excel Document Protections</h3>
 
<P>
When opening a Microsoft Excel document that has read-write
permission, a user can protect the original document from accidental
changes by selecting the Read Only check box in the Open dialog box.
This prevents the user from saving changes to the document under its
original name. In addition, you can protect a document so that it can
be opened only by supplying a password. For information on password
protection and opening documents, see Chapter 4 in Book 1 of the
Microsoft Excel User's Guide.
<P>
To open a shared document:

<OL><P><LI>Log on to the network computer that contains the document you want
   to open, and start Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open.

<P><LI>In the File Name box, select the document you want to open.

<P><LI>If you don't want to make changes to the original shared document,
   select the Read Only check box.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.
<P>
   If you try to open a document with read-write permission while another
   user has it open, Microsoft Excel displays a message saying that the
   document is locked.

<P><LI>If you see this message, choose the OK button to open a read-only
   copy of the document.
<P>
</OL>While you have a read-only copy of a locked document open, the first
user who opened the document is able to make changes that won't be
reflected in the copy you're using. You can't make changes to the
original.
<P>
When you open a read-only document, a message tells you that the
document is read-only. To save changes to a read-only document, save
the document under a different name.
