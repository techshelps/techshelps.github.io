The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Lotus Development Corporation's cc:Mail to send a mail message
containing a workbook from Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for Windows, all of
your mail messages are sent with a low priority setting.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This prioritization problem is caused by a problem contained in the version
of the MAPIVIM.DLL file that is shipped with Microsoft Excel version 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
later versions of Microsoft Excel for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, you must use a MAPIVIM.DLL file version
1.0.0.63 or later.
<P>
This version of the file is included with the following applications:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows version 6.0a
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Office version 4.2
<LI>International versions of Microsoft Excel version 5.0
<P>
</UL>If you do not have one of the above applications, you can obtain an
appropriate version of this file by accessing the application note
WE1009 "MAPI-to-VIM Translation .DLL MAPIVIM.DLL Version 1.0.0.63." For
more information about accessing this Application Note, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>  AppNote and WE1009 and translation

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The MAPIVIM.DLL file allows Microsoft applications, such as Microsoft
Excel and Microsoft Word for Windows, to insert documents into mail
messages and then send those messages using the cc:Mail program.
<P>
The MAPIVIM.DLL file that ships with Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for
Windows is version 1.0.0.53, dated 12/14/93. This version of MAPIVIM.DLL
contains a problem that causes all messages to be sent with a low priority
setting, even if you choose to send the message at a higher priority
setting.
<P>
If you have Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 installed on your
computer, do the following to check the version of MAPIVIM.DLL that is
installed on your system:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Windows File Manager, switch to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
   directory.

<P><LI>In the File list, select the MAPIVIM.DLL file.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Properties.

<P><LI>In the "Properties for MAPIVIM.DLL" dialog box, you should see
   a line that reads
<P>
<P><PRE>      Version: 1.0.0.xx
</PRE><P>
   where xx is a number.
<P>
</OL>If the version is earlier than 1.0.0.63, or if the date of the file
is earlier than 1/14/94, you will probably want to obtain a later
version of the MAPIVIM.DLL file.
