<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Many combinations of arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers
in Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Works may produce results that appear to
be incorrect by very small amounts; for example, the expression (.5-.4-.1)
may be evaluated to the quantity (2.8E-17), or .000000000000000028.
<P>
This behavior is not a problem in or a limitation of Microsoft Excel or 
Microsoft Works; this behavior occurs because the Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE) 754 floating-point standard requires 
that numbers be stored in binary format.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The IEEE 754 standard is a method of storing floating-point numbers in
a compact way that is easy to manipulate. This standard is used by
Intel coprocessors and most PC-based programs that implement
floating-point math.
<P>
IEEE 754 specifies that numbers be stored in binary format to reduce
storage requirements and allow the built-in binary arithmetic
instructions that are available on all microprocessors to process the data 
in a relatively rapid fashion. However, some numbers that are simple,
nonrepeating decimal numbers are converted into repeating binary numbers 
that cannot be stored with perfect accuracy.
<P>
For example, the number 1/10 can be represented in a decimal number
system with a simple decimal, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   .1

</PRE>However, the same number in binary format becomes the repeating binary
decimal
<P>
<PRE>   .0001100011000111000111 (and so on)

</PRE>and can be repeated as many times as you want. This number cannot be 
represented in a finite amount of space. Therefore, this number is rounded 
down by approximately -2.8E-17 when it is stored.
<P>
If several arithmetic operations are performed to obtain a given result,
these rounding errors may be accumulated.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, it may be possible in some cases to prevent rounding
errors from affecting your work by using the Precision As Displayed option. 
This option forces the value of each number in the worksheet to be the 
displayed value.
<P>
NOTE: If you use this option, you must format your numbers with a specific 
number format.
