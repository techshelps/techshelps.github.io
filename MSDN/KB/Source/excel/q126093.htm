The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a workbook that contains links to another workbook, Microsoft
Excel will ask you if you want to update links. If the file that the link
is referring to no longer exists, or if it has been moved to a different
folder, you may want to delete the links to avoid this message.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
One of the most common link types is a formula link. A link formula in a
cell can refer to a cell on a closed workbook file. If that file no longer
exists, the formula is no longer valid. To delete such a link, click Find
on the Edit menu, and search for an (!) exclamation point. This will show
each link in a sheet. You can then go to each cell, delete the formula, and
replace it with the value that was in the cell. If many cells contain
links, deleting the links may take some time. To speed up the deletion
process, you may want to use one of the following macros. The macro will
enable you to delete some links and not others.
<P>
NOTE: The Visual Basic Code Example is specifically for Microsoft Excel
version 5.0 and later. Also, note that the Microsoft Excel 4.0 example will
not work in Microsoft Excel version 5.0 and later because of the difference
in the link formulas. For example, a link formula in Microsoft Excel 5.0
and later may be similar to the following
<P>
<PRE>   ='c:\Excel\[book1.xls]sheet1'!$a$1

</PRE>while a Microsoft Excel 4.0 link may be similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ='c:\Excel\sheet1.xls'!$a$1

</PRE>Note also that these macros may not work if the source file for a link is
located on a network drive. If this is the case, the link will be found but
not deleted.
