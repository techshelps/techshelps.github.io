              Questions and Answers: Lotus 1-2-3 Interpreter
              ----------------------------------------------

1. Q. I am switching from Lotus 1-2-3 to Microsoft Excel. I have a
      number of macros that were created in Lotus 1-2-3. Can Excel run
      my existing Lotus 1-2-3 macros without modification?

   A. Microsoft Excel version 4.0 introduces the Macro Interpreter for
      Lotus 1-2-3 users. This new feature allows you to open your Lotus
      1-2-3 worksheets and run any macros on that worksheet, without
      modification or translation. Excel 4.0 supports only Lotus 1-2-3
      macros that contain functions, commands, and advanced macro
      commands supported by Lotus 1-2-3 release 2.01.

      To run a Lotus 1-2-3 macro in Microsoft Excel, follow these three
      steps:

      a. Open your Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet in Excel by choosing Open from
         the File menu.

      b. In the File Name edit box, type in the name of your Lotus 1-2-3
         worksheet, then press the OK button.

      c. Once the worksheet has been opened, choose the CTRL key and the
         letter of the macro name.

      If you are unsure what the letter of the Lotus 1-2-3 macro name
      is, you can verify the letter by following this two-step process:

      a. Once the worksheet has been opened, choose Define Name from the
         Formula menu.

      b. The range names for macros created in Lotus 1-2-3 will be
         listed in the Names In Sheet list box. Lotus 1-2-3 macro names
         start with the backslash character (\), which is followed by the
         letter of the macro name.

      For more information, see pages 26 through 29 of the "Switching to
      Microsoft Excel from Lotus 1-2-3" guide.

2. Q. I am switching from Lotus 1-2-3 to Microsoft Excel version 4.0. I
      want to be able to use the macros I created in Lotus 1-2-3 in
      Excel. Are there any limitations to Excel's ability to run Lotus
      1-2-3 macros?

   A. While Microsoft Excel 4.0 recognizes all Lotus 1-2-3 file formats,
      Excel fully supports only Lotus 1-2-3 macros that contain functions,
      commands, and advanced macro commands supported by Lotus 1-2-3
      release 2.01. Many Lotus 1-2-3 release 2.2 and 2.3 macros will
      run. See the "Switching to Microsoft Excel from Lotus 1-2-3" guide
      for a complete list of release 2.2 and 2.3 macros supported by
      Excel 4.0.

      A second limitation is that Excel runs only existing Lotus 1-2-3
      macros. You cannot create new Lotus 1-2-3 macros in Excel, nor can
      you call Lotus 1-2-3 macros from macros created by Microsoft
      Excel.

      For more information, see pages 26 through 27 of the "Switching to
      Microsoft Excel from Lotus 1-2-3" guide.

3. Q. I am trying to run my Lotus 1-2-3 macros in Microsoft Excel 4.0.
      When I run my macros, I get an alert that tells me that there is a
      macro error at a certain cell. When I choose the OK button in the
      alert box, a second alert comes up and tells me "Cannot End Macro
      in a Menu." How can I avoid this?

   A. Lotus 1-2-3 macros in Excel are not allowed to end in a menu. For
      example, the macro /pp normally leaves the focus in the Print
      Settings menu in Lotus 1-2-3, not in ready mode.

      To correct for such situations, edit the Lotus 1-2-3 macro to
      either exclude the offending macro or exit the menu. In the case of
      the /pp macro, placing a "q" at the end of the command (so it reads
      /ppq) will exit the Print Settings menu.

      For more information, see page 28 of the "Switching to Microsoft
      Excel from Lotus 1-2-3" guide.
