<OL><P><LI>INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. Quit Microsoft Excel 97, if it is running.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    B. Copy the Aapqbw50.dll file to the SBFM folder on your computer's
       hard disk. By default, this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft
       Office\Office\Sbfm.
</PRE><P>

<P><LI>PROBLEMS IMPORTING ACCOUNTING DATA FROM INTUIT QUICKBOOKS 5.0
<P>
   Before you import accounting data from QuickBooks 5.0 for Windows,
   you must register QuickBooks and disable all password protections on
   the data. In addition, if you have Quickbooks set to automatically
   enter memorized transactions, this should be disabled while running
   the Financial Manager filter. If you don't, you may receive a series
   of error messages, which you should clear by pressing ENTER in
   response to each.
<P>
   If you encounter problems importing accounting data from QuickBooks 5.0
   for Windows, you should run the QuickBooks utility to rebuild your
   accounting data, and then try importing again. To run the QuickBooks
   repair utility, choose Rebuild Data on the QuickBooks File:Utilities
   menu.

<P><LI>PROBLEMS WITH ACCOUNTS BEING INCORRECTLY CLASSIFIED IN FINANCIAL MANAGER
<P>
   Occasionally, when importing Quickbooks 5.0 data, accounts end up in the
   wrong category. This causes Financial Manager reports to be incorrect.
<P>
   If this occurs, use the Remap menu item on the Accounting Menu within
   Microsoft Excel to correctly map your data to the proper account
   categories.

<P><LI>DIFFERENCES IN ACCOUNT NUMBERS BETWEEN INTUIT QUICKBOOKS 5.0 AND
   FINANCIAL MANAGER
<P>
   If you use account numbers when setting up accounts in Quickbooks, these
   account numbers will not appear on Financial Manager reports. Financial
   Manager will create its own account numbers to ensure that reports are
   sorted correctly.

<P><LI>DIFFERENCES IN QUANTITY SOLD BETWEEN INTUIT QUICKBOOKS 5.0 AND FINANCIAL
   MANAGER
<P>
   When entering an invoice in Quickbooks 5.0, if you do not enter a sales
   price and quantity, it will default to a quantity of 1 when creating
   reports. This quantity is not an accurate reflection of the transaction.
<P>
   Financial Manager will use a quantity sold of 0 for these transactions,
   which properly reflects what was entered in the invoice. This will cause
   some differences between the quantity sold reported in Financial Manager
   and that reported in Quickbooks 5.0.
