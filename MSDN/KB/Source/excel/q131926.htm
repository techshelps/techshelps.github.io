The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you filter a large list of data using either the
AutoFilter or the Advanced Filter, it may take a longer time than expected
(or a longer time than you previously noticed) to filter the list.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if your worksheet that contains the list also contains
a cell formatted with a solid border. If a cell on the worksheet that
contains the list is formatted with a solid border (not dotted), when you
filter the list, it may take up to 100 times longer to filter the list than
if the worksheet does not contain any solid border cell formatting.
<P>
Additionally, even after you remove the border formatting from the cell(s)
on the worksheet, Microsoft Excel continues to take a long time to filter
the list--it takes longer to filter this list than it takes to filter a
list on a worksheet that has never contained solid borders.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, copy the list that you want to be filtered
to a new worksheet. If the list itself contains a cell with border cell
formatting, then do the following:

<OL><P><LI>To display the entire list, choose Filter from the Data menu, and then
   choose Show All.

<P><LI>Select the entire list, and choose Copy from the Edit menu.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose New to create a new workbook.

<P><LI>Select the cell that you want to contain your list, and choose Paste
   Special from the Edit menu. Under Paste, select either the Values or the
   Format option, and choose OK.
<P>
</OL>When you filter the list on the new worksheet, Microsoft Excel will take
less time to filter it than when the worksheet contained border cell
formatting.
<P>
If the list does not contain border cell formatting (that is, the border
cell formatting is elsewhere on the worksheet), you can copy the list
to a new worksheet, and paste the list using the Paste command (Edit menu).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Excel version 7.0 for Microsoft Windows 95. Microsoft Excel
version 7.0 was optimized to correct this problem. Note that it still
takes longer to filter a list on a worksheet that contains border cell
formatting than it does on a worksheet that does not contain this
formatting. However, this process takes much less time than it took in
version 5.0.
