</PRE>INSTALLING MICROSOFT EXCEL 98
<P>
<P><h3>Minimum System Requirements for Microsoft Excel 98 and Microsoft Office 98</h3>
 
<P>
To use Excel 98 or Office 98, you need:

<UL><LI>Any PowerPC processor-based, Mac OS-compatible system.
<LI>Apple System 7.5 or later.
<LI>16 MB of RAM required to run Excel individually (with virtual memory
   turned on); more memory is required to run additional programs
   simultaneously.
<LI>24 MB of RAM required to run Excel individually from a network or
   from the CD; more memory is required to run additional programs
   simultaneously.
<LI>33-78 MB of available hard disk space to install the Excel standalone
   program; approximately 55 MB required for Easy Install, depending on
   the configuration.
<LI>48-148 MB of available hard disk space to install Microsoft Office;
   approximately 90 MB required for Easy Install, depending on the
   configuration.
<LI>CD-ROM drive required (or connection to a Local Area Network if
   installing over network).
<LI>Monitor or display supporting 16 grays or 256 colors and 640x400 or
   greater resolution.
<P>
</UL>To use Excel 98 or Office 98, it is *recommended* that you have:

<UL><LI>A PowerPC processor with a clock speed of at least 120 MHz.
<LI>Apple System 7.5.5 or later.
<LI>32 MB of RAM (don't have to have virtual memory turned on).
<LI>Color monitor or display supporting greater than 256 colors and
   640x480 resolution.
<P>
</UL><h3>Performance with System 7.5.2 and 7.5.3</h3>
 
<P>
Updates are available for versions 7.5.2 and 7.5.3 of the system software
that contain substantial performance enhancements and improvements. These
updates are strongly recommended by Apple for all Macintosh computers
running previous releases of System 7.5 because they contain bug fixes and
allow Power Macintosh programs to launch significantly faster when virtual
memory is on. The updates to System 7.5.3 and System 7.5.5 are available in
the Value Pack folder on your Microsoft Office 98 CD. For more information
about installing components from the Value Pack, see the About the Value
Pack file in the Value Pack folder on the CD-ROM or on the network you
installed Excel or Office from.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Using Punctuation Characters in Folder Names May Cause Problems</h3>
 
<P>
If the name of the folder you install Microsoft Office 98, Microsoft Excel
98, Microsoft PowerPoint 98, or Microsoft Word 98 into includes a comma
(,), single quotation mark ('), or exclamation point (!), you may have
problems when you use the programs. To avoid problems, use the default
folder or use only letters and numbers in folder names.
<P>
<P>
Microsoft Excel Installer Overwrites 128-bit Version of Internet Explorer
File MS Internet Library (PPC)
 
<P>
If you have the 128-bit version of Microsoft Internet Explorer installed on
your Macintosh when you install Microsoft Office 98 or Microsoft Excel 98,
the file MS Internet Library (PPC) is replaced by a newer, 40-bit version
of the file with the same file name. This version of the file works fine
with both Internet Explorer and Office 98 Web features.
<P>
To see if there is a new 128-bit version of Internet Explorer that is
compatible with Microsoft Office 98, to replace the 40-bit version of the
file MS Internet Library (PPC), you can visit the Internet Explorer
Download Web site at

MICROSOFT EXCEL 98 MEMORY AND PERFORMANCE ISSUES
<P>
The following is a list of symptoms that may occur if there is not enough
memory available in Excel. If you are receiving any of these symptoms, you
can increase the memory requirements for Excel by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Excel.
 2. From the desktop, double-click the hard disk icon.
 3. Double-click the folder you installed Office 98 in, usually
    Microsoft Office 98.
 4. Click the Microsoft Excel icon.
 5. On the File menu, click Get Info.
 6. Under Memory Requirements, increase the value in the
    Preferred Size box by the amount listed below for the
    symptom you are experiencing.

</OL></UL><LI>When you use a wizard, you may receive a run-time error.
   SOLUTION: Increase the memory requirements for Excel by 2000K.
   If you use more than one wizard, each wizard uses additional
   memory, so you may need to further increase the memory
   requirements for Excel to accommodate the additional wizards.

<LI>When you use the Visual Basic Editor, you may receive a low-memory
   message. SOLUTION: Increase the memory requirements for Excel by 2000K.

<LI>Help topics that contain graphics may display the message "Unable to
   display picture." SOLUTION: Increase the memory requirements for
   Excel by 725K.
<P>
   NOTE:  If you have large or complex documents, and increasing the memory
   requirements for Excel does not address the symptoms described above,
   continue increasing the memory until the symptoms disappear.
<P>
</UL>________________________________________________________________
<P>
MICROSOFT EXCEL 98 HELP
<P>
Using the Keyboard to Select Options in the Office Assistant Welcome
Balloon
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Excel for the first time, the Office Assistant
shows a Welcome balloon with three options. You cannot start using Excel
until you select the third option, or press ESC to close the balloon. To
select an option using the keyboard, press COMMAND+1 to select the first
option, COMMAND+2 to select the second option, or COMMAND+3 to select the
third option.
<P>
NOTE: You may not be able to use the keyboard to select these options on a
non-U.S. keyboard, such as Italian, if the numeric keys are available only
when you hold down the SHIFT key.
<P>
<P><h3>Help Topics Graphics Don't Print Clearly</h3>
 
<P>
When you print a Help topic that contains a graphic, the graphic
may not print clearly. In particular, this occurs when you print
a topic with grayscale colors using a printer driver that does
not have options to control dithering.
<P>
<P><h3>Correction to MS Excel Help Topics</h3>
 
<P>
The "Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) graphics filter" topic in the MS Excel
Help file incorrectly states that the filter supports Encapsulated
PostScript images with Windows Metafile (WMF) embedded previews. Although
the image prints correctly, the embedded Windows Metafile (WMF) preview
does not appear on the screen when you insert the graphic.
<P>
<P><h3>Correction to MS Excel Upgrade Help Topics</h3>
 
<P>
The "Toolbars, graphics and integration with Microsoft Office" topic in the
MS Excel Upgrade Help file mentions the Office Shortcut Bar. There is no
Office Shortcut Bar in Microsoft Office 98.
<P>
The "Microsoft Excel on the Web" topic in the MS Excel Upgrade Help file
mentions the Web Form Wizard. There is no Web Form Wizard in Microsoft
Excel 98.
<P>
<P><h3>Correction to MS Clip Gallery Help Topics</h3>
 
<P>
The "File formats the Clip Gallery can import" topic in the MS Clip Gallery
Help file incorrectly states that the Clip Gallery supports the QuickTime
MPEG File Format. The Clip Gallery cannot import this file format.
<P>
The "Clip Gallery databases" topic in the MS Clip Gallery Help file
incorrectly states that the Clip Gallery database -- called the primary
database -- is stored in Macintosh HD:Microsoft Office 98:Office:Art
Gallery. The Clip Gallery database is actually stored in Macintosh
HD:System Folder:Preferences:Clip Gallery User Database.
<P>
The "Create a shared Clip Gallery database and configure a user's computer
to access it" topic in the MS Clip Gallery Help file gives the incorrect
name and location for the Clip Gallery database file. The corrected steps
in this topic should read as follows:
<P>
Create a shared Clip Gallery database

<OL><P><LI>To use the existing Clip Gallery database file, Clip Gallery User
    Database, as a shared database, go directly to step 8.
    To create a shared Clip Gallery database from scratch, from the
    desktop, open the Macintosh HD:System Folder:Preferences folder.

<P><LI>Click the Clip Gallery User Database icon, and then type a new name
    for this file, such as Clip Gallery User Database Old, to keep as a
    backup.

<P><LI>Open the Clip Gallery from within any program.
    The Clip Gallery creates a new empty Clip Gallery database file
    named Clip Gallery User Database.
<P>
    Step 7 should read as follows:
<P>
    7. From the desktop, copy the new Clip Gallery User Database file to a
       central location on the shared disk.
<P>
</OL>________________________________________________________________
WORKING WITH MICROSOFT EXCEL 98
<P>
<PRE>'Out of Memory' Message When Saving File as Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 Workbook
</PRE></OL> 
<P>
When you save a workbook in the Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 Workbook format that
contains a graphic, you may receive the message "Out of memory" and the
graphic may not appear when you open the saved workbook. This behavior
occurs with compressed graphic files and high-resolution graphic files when
the resolution of the graphic is very high. To avoid receiving this message
and losing the graphic, do the following before you save the workbook in
the Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 Workbook format:

<OL><P><LI>Select the graphic.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Cut.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Paste Special.

<P><LI>In the Paste As list, click Picture.
<P>
<P>
</OL>Microsoft Excel 5.0 and Microsoft Graph 5.0 Custom Chart Types Don't Appear
in Excel 98 and Graph 98
 
<P>
If you created custom chart types in either Microsoft Excel 5.0 or
Microsoft Graph 5.0, the custom chart types are not automatically available
in Excel 98 or Graph 98. To view the custom chart types you created in
Excel 5.0 or Graph 5.0 in Excel 98 and Graph 98, do the following before
you create custom chart types in Excel 98 or Graph 98:

<OL><P><LI>From the desktop, double-click the hard disk icon.

<P><LI>Double-click the System Folder icon.

<P><LI>Double-click the Preferences icon.

<P><LI>Double-click the Excel Startup Folder 5.

<P><LI>Arrange the folders so you can see both the Preferences and
    the Excel Startup Folder 5 folders.

<P><LI>Locate the Excel Chart AutoFormats (5) icon in the Excel Startup
    Folder 5 folder, and then drag this file to the Preferences folder.

<P><LI>Click the Excel Chart AutoFormats (5) icon name.

<P><LI>Type the new name, "Excel Chart User Gallery" (without the quotation
    marks), and then press RETURN.

<P><LI>Locate the Graph Chart AutoFormats (5) icon in the Preferences
    folder and click its name.

<P><LI>Type the new name, "Graph Chart User Gallery" (without the quotation
    marks), and then press RETURN.
<P>
</OL>The custom chart types you created in Excel 5.0 and Graph 5.0 now appear on
the Custom Types tab in the Chart Type dialog box when you select the User-
defined option in Excel 98 and Graph 98.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Graph 97 Object Formatting Appears Incorrectly</h3>
 
<P>
When you open an Excel workbook that contains a Microsoft Graph 97 object
created in Microsoft Windows, some of the chart formatting may appear
incorrectly. To correct the formatting, double-click the chart to open it
in Microsoft Graph 98.
<P>
<P>
Clip Gallery Doesn't Preserve Graphic Image Transparency
 
<P>
When you import a graphic image into the Clip Gallery, alpha channel
information is not preserved. A result of this behavior is that when you
insert a Clip Gallery image into your Office document, the transparency of
the image may be lost. To preserve the transparency of an image, point to
Picture on the Insert menu, and then click From File to insert your image.
<P>
<P><h3>Internet Explorer</h3>
 
<P>
If you currently use Internet Explorer version 4.0, please upgrade to
version 4.0a. Internet Explorer version 4.0a is included on the Office CD,
or you can download the latest version from the Web at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/mac">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/mac</A></B>

</PRE></OL><h3>Using Netscape Navigator and Hyperlinks in Office</h3>
 
<P>
If you use Netscape Navigator as your Web browser, you may receive the
following message when you click a hyperlink or open a Web page in an
Office program: "Office cannot open the URL you specified.  Make sure you
have a web browser installed and that it is configured correctly." This
message appears because Netscape has not been registered in the Internet
Preferences file. To avoid receiving this message, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the Apple menu, point to Control Panels, and then click
    Configuration Manager.

<P><LI>In the list on the left, under Network, click Protocol Helpers.

<P><LI>In the Protocol list, click File, and then click Change.

<P><LI>Click Choose Helper.

<P><LI>Locate and double-click the Netscape Navigator program file.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 3-5 for the following protocols: ftp, gopher, http,
    and https.

<P><LI>In the list on the left, under Network, click Proxies.

<P><LI>Make sure that your proxy setting information is the same as in
    Netscape Navigator.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You must quit and restart any Office programs that are running before
this change takes effect.
<P>
You can also use the Internet Config application to register Netscape
Navigator in the Internet Preferences file. Instructions for obtaining and
using Internet Config can be found at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.stairways.com/ic/index.html">http://www.stairways.com/ic/index.html</A></B>


</PRE></OL><h3>Shortcut Keys May Not Work with Non-U.S. Keyboard Layouts</h3>
 
<P>
Shortcuts keys may not work in Microsoft Excel if you are using a keyboard
layout other than U.S., such as Arabic. To use shortcut keys, change the
keyboard layout to U.S. If you have multiple keyboard layouts selected in
the Keyboard dialog box, including U.S., click U.S. on the Keyboard menu.
If the Keyboard menu does not appear on the menu bar or if U.S. is not
listed on the Keyboard menu, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the desktop, point to Control Panels on the Apple menu, and
    then click Keyboard.

<P><LI>In the list of keyboard layouts, select the U.S. check box.

<P><LI>Close the Keyboard dialog box.

<P><LI>On the Keyboard menu, click U.S.
<P>
</OL>For information about using shortcut keys in Excel, use the Office
Assistant or the Help Index to search for "shortcut keys." For more
information about changing the keyboard layout, see the documentation that
came with your Macintosh.
<P>
Using Microsoft Office 98 with Symantec AntiVirus for Macintosh
 
<P>
Microsoft Office 98 is incompatible with Symantec AntiVirus for Macintosh
virus definitions released before February 1998. If you are using one of
these older SAM virus definition files and you cannot immediately download
the latest update, you should disable the SAM Intercept extension in
Extensions Manager before you run any of the Office applications.
<P>
For additional information and the latest SAM definitions, check the
Symantec Web site at:

MICROSOFT OFFICE 98 VALUE PACK
<P>
Cannot Install Value Pack Components if Running Office Programs from the CD
or a Network
 
<P>
If you run a Microsoft Office program from the CD or network drive instead
of installing it to your hard disk, you cannot use the Value Pack Installer
to install Value Pack components. The Value Pack Installer requires that
your Office programs be installed on your hard disk because, to work
correctly, Value Pack components must be located in specific folders on
your hard disk relative to the rest of the Office files.
<P>
<P>
Message Appears When Using Microsoft Query for the First Time in Microsoft
Excel
 
<P>
If you install Microsoft Query from the Value Pack (Data Access component),
a message appears the first time you use the Create New Query or Run
Database Query command (Data menu, Get External Data command) in Microsoft
Excel. The message incorrectly states that Microsoft Query has not been
installed. However, if you use the command a second time, Microsoft Query
will start correctly and you will not receive the message again. This
problem only occurs the first time you use Microsoft Query in Microsoft
Excel.
<P>
Error Adding Text or dBASE Tables in Microsoft Query
 
<P>
If you have problems adding tables with the text or dBASE ODBC drivers,
refer to the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Correction to Phone Number for Palo Alto Software
 
<P>
The Small Business Pack templates, installed as a component of the Value
