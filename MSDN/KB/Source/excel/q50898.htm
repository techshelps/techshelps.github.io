<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information explains how to use Microsoft Excel for the
Macintosh version 2.2 files in a Microsoft Word print merge and how to
convert Excel for the Macintosh version 2.2 files to and from Lotus
1-2-3, Lotus Symphony, Lotus Jazz, Microsoft Multiplan, Microsoft
Excel for Windows, Microsoft File, Microsoft Works for the Macintosh,
and text files.
<P>
<PRE>                          FILE CONVERSION
                          ---------------

</PRE><h3>PRINT MERGE WITH MICROSOFT WORD</h3>
 
<P>
There are two ways to use your data from Excel version 2.20 with
Word's print merge facility to create form letters, mailing labels,
and other form documents. You can either use the Clipboard to copy the
region of data from Microsoft Excel and paste into Microsoft Word to
create a data document, or save the Microsoft Excel file as Text.
<P>
To move your data using the Clipboard, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Select the area of data that you want as your data document.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Copy.

<P><LI>Open a new Word document.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Paste.
<P>
</OL>With this method, your data can start and end at any cell in your
Excel worksheet. This method is especially convenient, as it brings
the data into Microsoft Word with formatting retained. (Note:
Formatting in the data document does not affect the printout, but it
may be convenient for visual display.) As an added bonus, Excel 2.20
brings the copied data into Word 4.00 as a table.
<P>
If you save your Excel data file as Text, the program will place
quotation marks around any fields that have commas within them.
However, formatting will be lost. Also, make sure that your data
region begins in cell A1; otherwise, the program will fill the
beginning of your data document with tabs and returns which will throw
off your print merge. This method is not as convenient as the
Clipboard method, but may be more feasible with large spreadsheets
that are inconvenient to copy.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>LOTUS 1-2-3 AND SYMPHONY FILES</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Importing</h3>
 
<P>
Excel 2.20 can directly read and write the WK1 and WKS file formats.
Additionally, you can see these files in the Open dialog, just as in
versions 1.00, 1.03, 1.04, and 1.06. To import, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Use a communications package or a file-transfer utility to bring
   the file into the Macintosh environment.

<P><LI>Open Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open.

<P><LI>Select the appropriate file and click Open.
<P>
</OL><h3>Exporting</h3>
 
<P>
To save a worksheet as a WKS Lotus 1-2-3 versions 1.x or a Symphony
file, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In the Excel document, choose Save As from the File menu.

<P><LI>Specify the name.

<P><LI>Click WKS or WK1 (in Excel 2.20, click the Options button).

<P><LI>Click Save. Excel automatically converts the worksheet into a 1-2-3
   or Symphony file (WKS or WK1 format).
<P>
</OL>Excel translates all of the numbers, text entries, and supported
formulas.
<P>
For more information about converting from Lotus 1-2-3 to Microsoft
Excel, see Page 445 of the "Microsoft Excel Reference" version 2.2
manual.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel - Lotus Date Conversion</h3>
 
<P>
When importing a Lotus or Symphony file, Excel 2.20 automatically
selects the 1900 base year. When exporting to Lotus, choose
Calculation from the Options menu and deselect the 1904 base year,
prior to creating the Excel document.
<P>
<P><h3>Macro Conversion</h3>
 
<P>
By using the macro-conversion utility shipped with Excel for Windows,
you can bring a macro sheet into Excel for Windows from Lotus. Excel
for the Macintosh 2.20 shares the same file format as Excel for
Windows and can thus read in the macro sheet once it is saved from
Excel for Windows in Normal format. There is no macro conversion
utility available on the Macintosh because the Macintosh does not
support DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange), which the macro converter utility
uses.
<P>
Note: This procedure works only with Excel version 2.20. To bring the
macro sheet into earlier versions of Excel, you need to bring it into
Excel for Windows and then save it in the SYLK file format. Since
Excel versions 1.x can read the SYLK file format, you can then open
the macro sheet that was originally on the PC.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>MICROSOFT EXCEL FOR WINDOWS FILES</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Importing</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using Excel for Windows, you can easily import your
worksheet, macro sheet, and/or chart into Excel for the Macintosh
version 2.20. Excel for the Macintosh 2.20 uses the same file format
as Excel for Windows, BInary File Format (BIFF). Do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Save the Excel for Windows file normally.

<P><LI>Use a communication package or a file-exchange utility to bring it
   over to the Macintosh.

<P><LI>Open the file directly into Excel for the Macintosh. Any
   differences in functions will be listed in your manual.
<P>
</OL><h3>Exporting</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using Excel for the Macintosh, you can easily import your
worksheet, macro sheet, and/or chart into Excel for Windows. Excel for
the Macintosh 2.20 uses the same file format as Excel for Windows,
BInary File Format (BIFF). Do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Save the Excel for the Macintosh file normally.

<P><LI>Use a communication package or a file-exchange utility to bring it
   over to the PC.

<P><LI>Open the file directly into Excel for Windows. Any differences in
   functions will be listed in your manual.
<P>
</OL><h3>Excel for the Macintosh - Excel for Windows Date Conversion</h3>
 
<P>
Excel version 2.20 gives you a choice of date systems. When importing
an Excel for Windows file, Excel for the Macintosh 2.20 automatically
selects the 1900 base year. When transferring files to Excel for
Windows from Excel for the Macintosh, you have a choice of date
systems. Before taking your Excel for the Macintosh files into Excel
for Windows, choose Calculation from the Options menu and deselect the
1904 Date System box.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>EXCEL FOR THE MACINTOSH VERSIONS 1.x</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Importing</h3>
 
<P>
Open the Excel versions 1.x document directly into Excel 2.20 by using
one of the two following methods:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the document while in Finder.

<P><LI>From the File menu in Excel 2.20, choose Open, select the versions
   1.x document, and click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Exporting</h3>
 
<P>
You can never transfer an Excel 2.20 worksheet and/or macro sheet
directly into earlier versions of Excel due to the new file format.
However, you can save the Excel 2.20 file in the SYLK file format and
open it into the earlier versions by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save As while in the version 2.20
   document.

<P><LI>Click the Options button.

<P><LI>Select Excel 1.5/SYLK.

<P><LI>Click OK, and click Save.
<P>
</OL>You can never read an Excel 2.20 chart into earlier versions of Excel
as a chart. You must bring the worksheet information over to the
earlier version of Excel as explained above and then create a new
chart.
<P>
<P><h3>LOTUS JAZZ FILES</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Importing</h3>
 
<P>
To import a Jazz worksheet into Excel, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Open the worksheet in Jazz.

<P><LI>Select the entire working area of your worksheet and use the Range
   Format command to set the format to Formula Text. This will convert
   your formulas into their text equivalents.

<P><LI>Copy the entire worksheet (or portions that will fit) into the
   Clipboard by selecting the cells and using the Copy command.

<P><LI>Quit Jazz and start Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>As soon as you get a blank worksheet, use the Paste command to
   retrieve the worksheet from the Clipboard.
<P>
</OL>Range indicators need to be changed from periods to colons to make
formulas valid once they are pasted into Excel because Jazz uses
"A1..A3" to indicate a range and Excel uses "A1:A3". Also keep in mind
that any Jazz formulas with different names or syntax [for example,
ISERR() vs. ISERROR()] will not translate correctly. Refer to your
"Microsoft Excel Arrays, Functions and Macros" manual for version 1.50
for the proper Excel function or syntax.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>MICROSOFT MULTIPLAN FILES</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Importing</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Multiplan files can be opened directly with Microsoft Excel
versions 1.00, 1.03, 1.04, 1.06, and 1.50. To open a Multiplan file
into Excel 2.20, the Multiplan file must be saved in the SYLK file
format. This is done by choosing Save As from the File menu in
Multiplan and selecting the SYLK option. When first converted, these
documents will be larger (in kilobytes) than their Microsoft Multiplan
counterparts. This is due to differences in the way formulas are
referenced.
<P>
Microsoft Multiplan for DOS worksheets can be transported to Microsoft
Excel by saving them as SYLK. This is done from the PC by doing the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Use the Transfer Options Symbolic command (with the worksheet
   loaded) to place Microsoft Multiplan in SYLK mode.

<P><LI>Use the Transfer Save command to save the SYLK file to disk.

<P><LI>Use a communications package or a file exchange utility to
   transport the files to the Macintosh.

<P><LI>Start Excel.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open.
<P>
</OL>To ensure the best possible results, make sure you are using the most
current version of Multiplan available on the source computer. Excel
supports every Multiplan function except DELTA() and ITERCNT(); Excel
will not convert a formula that contains either of these functions.
<P>
<P><h3>Exporting</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to use an Excel worksheet in Multiplan, you can save the
worksheet as a SYLK file, then open that worksheet in Multiplan. Any
information that Multiplan does not understand, such as formulas
containing unsupported functions, will either be ignored completely or
will produce an error. As long as the Excel worksheet contains only
formulas that Multiplan supports, you can transfer the worksheet
without losing formats or formulas.
<P>
For more information about converting from Microsoft Multiplan to
Microsoft Excel, see "Notes for the Microsoft Multiplan User" in
Appendix C of the "Microsoft Excel Reference" version 2.0 manual.
<P>
<P><h3>MICROSOFT FILE</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Importing</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using File, you can easily import your database into Excel
by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft File, choose Save As from the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Click Text (Microsoft Print Merge), then Save.

<P><LI>Quit Microsoft File and start Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open.

<P><LI>Click on the database filename, then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Exporting</h3>
 
<P>
To move information from Excel into a new or existing Microsoft File
database, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Save the worksheet as Text.

<P><LI>Quit Excel and start File.

<P><LI>Create a new data file or open an existing one.

<P><LI>Set up the data file form to match the order of the fields in your
   Excel database.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open Datafile.

<P><LI>Select the Excel text document in the list box and click Open. File
   will add a record for each line of the text document and a field
   for each tab separated value in the line.
<P>
</OL>Note: You can Copy and Paste an Excel chart into a database field, but
the field must be formatted as a Picture field.
<P>
<P><h3>MICROSOFT WORKS FILES</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Importing</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using Works, you can easily import your Spreadsheet and
Database documents into Excel by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>From Works, choose Save As from the File menu.

<P><LI>Click Export File and type in the name of the document. (For a
   Spreadsheet document, after you click Export File and Save, Works
   displays another dialog box to specify the format. Choose SYLK.)

<P><LI>Quit Microsoft Works and start Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Choose Open from the File menu, click on the document's name, then
   click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Exporting</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to use an Excel worksheet in Works, you can save the
worksheet as a SYLK file, then open that worksheet in Works as a
spreadsheet. Any information that Works does not understand, such as
formulas containing unsupported functions will either be ignored
completely or will produce an error. As long as the Excel worksheet
contains only formulas that Works supports, you can transfer without
losing formats or formulas.
<P>
<P><h3>TEXT FILES</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Importing</h3>
 
<P>
Excel will open a text file from any computer using the standard ASCII
character set. To get numbers or text to appear in separate columns,
the numbers/text should be separated with tabs and have a carriage
return at the end of each line. If another field (column) delimiter is
used, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Open the source file with Microsoft Word or another Macintosh text
   editor.

<P><LI>Replace the delimiters with tabs.

<P><LI>Save the file as Text Only.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Excel, and open the text file.
<P>
</OL><h3>Exporting</h3>
 
<P>
To save an Excel versions 1.50 and earlier file as text, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save As.

<P><LI>Click the button marked Text.

<P><LI>Click Save. The resulting text file will be tab delimited.
<P>
</OL>In Excel 2.20, you can save a text file as either tab or comma
delimited. To save a text file in Excel 2.20, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save As.

<P><LI>Click the Options button.

<P><LI>Select either Text (tab delimited) or CSV/Text (comma separated).

<P><LI>Click OK and click Save.
<P>
</OL>When you save an Excel file as text, any cells containing commas will
be enclosed in quotation marks.
