The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you open a version 5.0 workbook file by choosing
the filename from the bottom of the File menu, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   File format is not valid

</PRE>Additionally, if you open a workbook, worksheet, or chart created in
a version of Microsoft Excel earlier than 5.0, by choosing the filename
from the bottom of the File menu, you receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot read this binary file. If the file was created in a version of
   Microsoft Excel later than 5.0, use that version to save it as a
   Microsoft Excel 5.0 file. Open file as text?

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you have recently selected Microsoft Multiplan
(*.*) or Lotus 1-2-3 Release 4 or 5 (*.wk4) from the List Files Of Type
list in the Open dialog box. If you have selected one of these file
converters in the Open dialog box, even if you don't open a file using the
selected converter, you cannot open a .XLS, .XLW, or .XLC file by choosing
the file name from the bottom of the File menu.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving this error message, use either of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1: Open the .XLS file by choosing Open from the File menu, and then
<PRE>          select the file that you want to open.

</PRE>Method 2: To open .XLS files from the quick list, do the following:
<P>
<PRE>          a. From the File menu, choose Open.

          b. From the List Files Of Type list, select an option other than
             Microsoft Multiplan (*.*), or Lotus 1-2-3 Release 4 or 5
             (*.WK4), such as All Files (*.*).

          c. Choose OK.

          d. Choose Cancel.

          You can now choose a file name from the File menu without
          receiving this error message.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The names of the four files that you have opened most recently appear
at the bottom of the File menu. You can open any of these files by
choosing the filename from the File menu.
<P>
NOTE: To open Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 files in Microsoft Excel, you must obtain the
Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 File Converter. The Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 File Converter is
available in application note WE1130 "Lotus 1-2-3 WK4 File Converter." You
