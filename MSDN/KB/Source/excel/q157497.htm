<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 97 and Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition include a new
feature that allows you to save a workbook in a dual format. If you are
using Excel 97 for Windows, the format is called "Microsoft Excel 97 &amp;
5.0/95 Workbook." If you are using Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, the format
is called "Microsoft Excel 5.0 &amp; 95-98 Workbook." This article explains how
the format works, why you would want to use it, and includes a list of
potential problems that you may encounter.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>What Is the Dual Format and How Does it Work?</h3>
 
<P>
The dual format is a special kind of file format. A workbook saved in this
format contains two sections: one section that is written in the Microsoft
Excel 5.0/95 file format, and one section that is written in the Microsoft
Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98 file format. When you use this format to
save a workbook, you can open it in Microsoft Excel versions 5.0, 7.0,
Microsoft Excel 97, and Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
When you save a file in the dual format in Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft
Excel 98, the following events take place:

<OL><P><LI>The Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98 section of the workbook
   is written.

<P><LI>The Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 section of the workbook is synchronized
   with the Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98 section, so that
   they contain the same values.

<P><LI>The Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 section of the workbook is written.

<P><LI>The workbook is saved.
<P>
</OL>When you open the workbook in Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98, the
Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98 section of the workbook is read.
If you make changes to the workbook and then resave it, the changes to the
Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98 section are copied to the
Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 section of the workbook, and the workbook is saved.
<P>
When you open the workbook in Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 or 7.0, only the
Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 section of the workbook is read. If you make changes
to the workbook and save it, the Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98
section of the workbook is lost. This behavior occurs because earlier
versions of Microsoft Excel are not aware of the Microsoft Excel 97 or
Microsoft Excel 98 section of the workbook.
<P>
A workbook stored in the dual format may be up to twice as large as a
normal workbook. This is because data stored within the workbook is stored
twice, once in each section of the workbook.
<P>
To save a workbook in the dual format, follow these steps in Microsoft
Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As.

<P><LI>In the Save As Type list, if you are using Microsoft Excel 97 click
   "Microsoft Excel 97 &amp; 5.0/95 Workbook." If you are using Microsoft Excel
   98 click "Microsoft Excel 5.0 &amp; 95-98 Workbook."

<P><LI>Change the file name if you want, and then click Save.
<P>
</OL><h3>Why Would I Want to Use the Dual Format?</h3>
 
<P>
The dual format is useful when a mix of users who run different versions of
Microsoft Excel all need to be able to view the same workbook.
<P>
If users running Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98 open a workbook
that is saved in this format, they will not notice any unusual behavior.
They can make changes and save the workbook just like any other workbook.
<P>
If users who run Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 or 7.0 open a workbook that
is saved in this format, they are prompted to open the workbook as read-
only. The specific warning message is the following:
<P>
<PRE>   '&lt;Filename.xls&gt;' should be opened as read-only unless you need to save
   changes to it. Open as read-only?

</PRE></OL>If a user chooses not to open the workbook as read-only, and then saves the
workbook, the Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98 section of the
workbook is lost. Features that are specific to Microsoft Excel 97 or
Microsoft Excel 98, such as conditional formatting and natural language
formulas, are lost because earlier versions of Microsoft Excel do not
support these features. Also, if worksheets in the workbook contain more
than 16,384 rows of information, data in rows below row 16,384 are lost.
<P>
What Potential Problems Might I Encounter When Using
the Dual Format?
 
<P>
You may encounter the following problems when you use this format:

<UL><LI>As stated earlier, if users running an earlier version of Microsoft
   Excel open a workbook saved in the dual format, and then save it,
   the Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Excel 98 section of the workbook
   is lost. Along with any special features not supported in earlier
   versions of Microsoft Excel, they lose all data below row 16,384.
<P>
   Because of this, Microsoft recommends that you keep workbooks saved in
   this format as simple as possible. Data in worksheets that contain data,
   normal formatting, and so, is not lost if you save the workbook in an
   earlier version format.
<P>
   Note that you can apply a protection password to the workbook so that
   users who use earlier versions of Microsoft Excel cannot save changes to
   the workbook.

<LI>If you use another program, such as Microsoft Access, to make changes
   to a workbook saved in the dual format, the changes may be incorrectly
   applied to the workbook. This occurs because other programs may not
   support the dual nature of the workbook, and the workbook's sections
   may become unsynchronized.
<P>
</UL>For more information on the problems you may encounter when modifying such
a workbook using Microsoft Access, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q157495.htm">Q157495</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL: Odd Workbook Behavior after Modification by MS
               Access

</PRE><LI>As stated earlier in this article, workbooks saved in the dual format
   are larger than workbooks that are not saved in this format. This may
   cause problems when you save or store such workbooks on floppy disks.
<P>
   Microsoft recommends that you do not directly save a workbook in the
   dual format on a floppy disk. Instead, save the workbook to the hard
   disk, close the workbook, and then copy it to the floppy disk.
