The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A file opened as read-only through a Visual Basic macro will remain
read-only to other applications until it is closed.
<P>
This is normal operation of Visual Basic. Visual Basic opens the file
for input in compatibility mode; this prevents other users from opening
the file in anything other than compatibility-input mode.
<P>
This functionality is different than the FOPEN function in Microsoft Excel
version 4.0. The statement =FOPEN(filename,2) will allow read-only access
while allowing full access to other applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Macro Example</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied,
including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability
and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This Visual Basic procedure
is provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that it can be
used in all situations. Microsoft does not support modifications of
this procedure to suit customer requirements for a particular purpose.
Note that a line that is preceded by an apostrophe introduces a
comment in the code--comments are provided to explain what the code is
doing at a particular point in the procedure. Note also that an
underscore character (_) indicates that code continues from one line
to the next. You can type lines that contain this character as one
logical line or you can divide the lines of code and include the line
continuation character. For more information about Visual Basic for
Applications programming style, see the "Programming Style in This
Manual" section in the "Document Conventions" section of the "Visual
Basic User's Guide."
<P>
The following code opens a file (C:\TEST.TXT) as read only and forces the
file as read only to other applications until you close the file or quit
Microsoft Excel:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Test()
      Dim FileNumber as Integer
      FileNumber = FreeFile()
      Open "c:\test.txt" For Input Access Read As #FileNumber
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Open the file C:\TEST.TXT in a text editor (such as Write, which is
   located in the accessories group of Program Manager).

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save.

<P><LI>You will receive a message stating that the file is read-only and should
   be saved as a different name.
<P></OL>
