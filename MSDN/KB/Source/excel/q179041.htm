The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition, when you attempt to rename a
worksheet in your workbook to History, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   History is a reserved name.

</PRE>NOTE: This also occurs in Microsoft Excel 98 if you open a workbook created
in an earlier version of Microsoft Excel and try to rename a worksheet
called History (you can have worksheets named history in earlier versions
of Microsoft Excel).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You receive the error message because Microsoft Excel 98 uses the word
History as part of its history tracking feature. Microsoft Excel 98 creates
a worksheet with the name History when you select "List changes on a new
sheet" in the Highlight Changes dialog box. (On the Tools menu, point to
Track Changes and click Highlight Changes.)
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If this problem occurs, use another name. Do not use the name History.
<P>
NOTE: It doesn't matter whether you use History in uppercase or lowercase;
the same error occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel 98.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can open a workbook created in an earlier version of Microsoft Excel
that contains a sheet named History. Earlier versions of Microsoft Excel do
not have the same tracking feature and History is not a reserved word in
those versions; therefore, a sheet can have the name History. If you open a
workbook in Microsoft Excel 98 that was created in an earlier version, and
it has a sheet named History, that sheet is renamed History(2) if you use
the tracking feature.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel you can share files with other people and work on the
data collaboratively. If you want several people to work on the data in
your workbook simultaneously, you can save it as a shared workbook. The
History worksheet is separate from your data worksheets and lists
information about changes made and saved in a shared workbook. It includes
who made the change, when and where the change was made, what data was
deleted or replaced, and how conflicts were resolved.
