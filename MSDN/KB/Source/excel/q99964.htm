The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, if you copy a chart object (embedded chart) and
use the Paste Link command to paste it as a picture into another
application such as Microsoft Word version 2.0 for Windows, the image
may appear clipped, cut in half, or very small relative to its frame.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This situation will occur when the Window Zoom option on the sheet
containing the chart object is set to a magnification other than 100%
and one of the following conditions is also true:

<UL><LI>You have saved, closed, and reopened the worksheet containing the
   chart object.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You have changed the Window Zoom magnification after copying the
   chart and before using the Paste Link command to paste the chart in
   the other application.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Microsoft
Excel listed above. This problem was corrected in version 5.0 of Microsoft
Excel for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the chart object after you have used the Copy and Paste
Link commands to paste it, after you save close, and reopened, the
worksheet, it will appear cropped or halved. The chart object will be
pasted correctly if the worksheet has been saved for the first time
and has not yet been closed and reopened.
<P>
Regardless of whether or not the worksheet has been saved, if you
decrease the Zoom magnification after copying the chart, the result
when you paste it with the Paste Link command will be a small chart
inside a large frame. If you increase the Zoom after copying the
chart, the result is similar to the clipping effect described in the
Summary section of this article.
<P>
To use the Paste Link command to paste a Microsoft Excel chart in
Microsoft Word (or another application that supports object linking
and embedding [OLE]), choose Paste Special from the Edit menu, select
Picture and choose Paste Link. If you paste the chart without linking
(by choosing Paste from the Edit menu or by choosing the Paste button
in the Paste Special dialog box), the image will be rendered
correctly. This problem does not occur with other objects created with
the drawing tools in Microsoft Excel--these objects cannot be linked
with the Paste Link command.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
When you edit the chart once in Microsoft Excel, the chart size in
Microsoft Word or your other application will be updated properly. You
can edit the chart prior to copying it or after pasting it with the
Paste Link command. An easy and fast way to edit the chart in
Microsoft Excel is to open it into a chart window by double-clicking
the chart object and then closing the chart window. The chart in your
other application will then be updated to the correct size; or, if you
paste the chart with the Paste Link command for the first time, the
image rendered will be the correct size.
