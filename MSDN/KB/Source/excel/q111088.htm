<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed above, the state in which a
window is opened is based on the state of the last window that was closed.
Because of this behavior, you may find that files that were saved in a
restored state are opened in a maximized state, and vice versa.
<P>
Whether or not a window is maximized when you open it is an attribute of
the Microsoft Excel workspace. An exception to this is if the workbook's
window has been protected.
<P>
This behavior is different from earlier versions of Microsoft Excel
for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel when a file is open, the window will appear in one of
two states:
<P>
<PRE>   In this state    The window occupies this portion of the screen
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   Maximized        The entire application window. The filename appears
                    in the title bar as "Microsoft Excel - BOOK1.XLS."

   Restored         Some portion smaller than the entire application
                    window. The filename appears as "BOOK1.XLS."

</PRE>Note also that if one file's window is maximized, all of the other open
windows are also maximized. If you open another file, its window will also
be maximized.
<P>
If a file opens in a maximized view, you can restore it by choosing Restore
from the document control menu or by pressing CTRL+F5. The window will
return to its last saved size.
<P>
If a file opens restored but should open maximized, maximize the window by
choosing Maximize from the Document control menu or by pressing CTRL+F10.
The window for the file (and all other open windows) will be maximized.
<P>
To protect the workbook's window do the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Protection and then click Protect Workbook.

<P><LI>If you would like to prevent people from unprotecting this workbook,
   type a password.

<P><LI>Select the Windows check box and click OK.

<P><LI>If you typed a password in step 2, you will be prompted to reenter the
   password. Type the password again and click OK.
<P>
