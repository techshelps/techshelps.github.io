<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you drag cells from a Microsoft Excel worksheet to a Microsoft Word
document or to a Microsoft PowerPoint slide, you receive one of the
following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Your file could not be printed due to an error on unknown printer (check
   Chooser).  There are several possible reasons:

   - There may not be enough memory available.  Try closing files and
     programs you aren't using.
   - Your printer or its driver may not be set up correctly. See the OS
     Guide for your computer for instructions to check or set up the
     printer.
   - If you use a network for printing, there may be a problem with the
     network connection or the printer driver.
   - There may be loose cables or a bad connection between your computer
     and printer.

   -or-

   Your file could not be printed due to an error on ImageWriter.  There
   are several possible reasons:

   - There may not be enough memory available.  Try closing files and
     programs you aren't using.
   - Your printer or its driver may not be set up correctly. See the OS
     Guide for your computer for instructions to check or set up the
     printer.
   - If you use a network for printing, there may be a problem with the
     network connection or the printer driver.
   - There may be loose cables or a bad connection between your computer
     and printer.

</PRE>When you click OK to dismiss the error message, your computer beeps. You
must press RETURN to dismiss the error message.

<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>

This problem occurs if an active printer driver is not selected in the

PowerPoint slide a second time, and then press RETURN to dismiss the error
message. The cells are inserted into the document.
