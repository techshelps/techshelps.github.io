The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 5.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0, if the active sheet is a module or macro
sheet, you can make the entire workbook into an add-in (.XLA) file by
choosing the Make Add-In command from the Tools menu. In the Make Add-In
dialog box, when you choose the Options button, Microsoft Excel displays
the Save Options dialog box. Although these options appear to control how
the add-in will be saved and how it will behave when you open it, they do
not affect the way the add-in file is saved or opened.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Make Add-In dialog box was modeled after the Save As dialog box. When
you choose the Options button in the Save As dialog box, you can
successfully create passwords, specify read-only attributes, and create
backup copies of your workbook files. These passwords and read-only
attributes are useful for protecting workbooks from being opened or
modified by users who do not know the password.
<P>
Add-in files, on the other hand, do not need to be protected by a password.
These files are compiled so that once they are created they cannot be
opened, not even by the original user.
<P>
In addition, the backup for an add-in is the workbook that contains the
original code; this code can be recompiled if the add-in is damaged. For
this reason, a backup is not created even if the option is selected in the
Save Options dialog box (the one that you get when you choose the Options
button in the Make Add-In dialog box).
<P>
NOTE: If you choose the Read-Only Recommended option when you save an add-
in, you will receive the following message when you open that add-in:
<P>
<PRE>   'ADD-IN.XLA' should be opened as read-only unless you need to save
   changes to it. Open as read-only?

</PRE>where ADD-IN.XLA is the name of the add-in you opened. However, this option
has no effect on the add-in since you cannot make any changes to the add-
in.
