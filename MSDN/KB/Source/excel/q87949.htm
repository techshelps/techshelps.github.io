1. Q. When I try to install Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for Windows, I
      receive a message telling me that Microsoft Windows needs to be
      in standard or in 386 enhanced mode. How can I correct this
      problem?

   A. Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for Windows requires that Microsoft
      Windows version 3.0 be either in standard or in 386 enhanced
      mode. To run in either standard or 386 enhanced mode, the
      Windows memory manager, HIMEM.SYS, must be present in the
      CONFIG.SYS file.

      To configure your system for proper Windows 3.0 operation, use
      the following five-step procedure to install HIMEM.SYS:

      Step 1. Find HIMEM.SYS on your system's hard disk. (Windows
      installs this file into the WINDOWS directory; MS-DOS installs
      this file into the DOS directory.) Once you determine where
      HIMEM.SYS is located, copy it to the root of your hard drive by
      typing the following:

            copy himem.sys c:\

      If you can't locate HIMEM.SYS on your system, please call
      Microsoft Windows technical support at (425) 637-7098.

      Step 2. Start Windows. From the Program Manager File menu,
      choose Run. In the Command Line dialog box, type "sysedit"
      (without the quotation marks) to start the Microsoft System
      Configuration Editor.

      Step 3. Four windows, titled CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT,
      SYSTEM.INI, and WIN.INI, appear on your screen. Choose the
      CONFIG.SYS window by clicking the title bar or by choosing
      CONFIG.SYS from the Window menu.

      Step 4. Type the following line at the beginning of the file:

         device=c:\himem.sys

      Step 5. From the File menu, choose Save. Quit the System
      Configuration Editor, quit Windows, and reboot your computer.

      Restart Windows and confirm that Windows 3.0 is running in
      standard or in 386 enhanced mode by choosing About Program
      Manager from the File menu. If Windows is in standard or in 386
      enhanced mode, you now can install Microsoft Excel 3.0. If
      Windows is still in real mode, please call Microsoft Windows
      technical support at (425) 637-7098.

2. Q. Is there anything special I need to know about installing
      Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for Windows on a network?

   A. There is a text file called NETWORK.TXT on the Microsoft Excel
      3.0 for Windows Setup disk that specifically discusses
      installing Microsoft Excel 3.0 on a network.

      To view this file, use the following four steps:

      Step 1. Put the Setup disk in drive A.

      Step 2. Start Windows by typing "win" (without the quotation
      marks) and pressing ENTER.

      Step 3. From the Program Manager File menu, choose Run. In the
      Command Line dialog box, type the following:

         notepad a:network.txt

      Step 4. Press ENTER to start the Microsoft Windows Notepad
      application and load the NETWORK.TXT file.

      For more information regarding installing Excel on a network
      server, please refer to page 701 of the "Microsoft Excel User's
      Guide" for version 3.0.

3. Q. When I install Microsoft Excel version 3.0 for Windows, I am
      given the opportunity to select which Excel options I want. What
      are each of these options and why should I install them?

   A. There are seven options you can install during the Microsoft
      Excel 3.0 for Windows Setup program. The following is an
      overview of the seven options available:

      Option 1. Microsoft Excel: This option installs the minimum
      files necessary to use Microsoft Excel 3.0. If you are
      installing Microsoft Excel 3.0 for the first time, you must
      select this option.

      Option 2. Microsoft Excel Tutorial: This option installs a
      series of online lessons, an excellent way to learn Microsoft
      Excel 3.0 interactively.

      Option 3. Dialog Editor: This option installs an application
      called the Dialog Editor. You can use the Dialog Editor to
      create custom dialog boxes for Microsoft Excel 3.0 command
      macros and custom forms to enter database information.

      Option 4. Macro Translator: This option installs the Macro
      Translation Assistant, a utility that helps you translate your
      Lotus 1-2-3 (R) and Microsoft Multiplan (R) macros into
      Microsoft Excel 3.0 macros.

      Option 5. Macro Library files: This option installs a set of
      sample worksheets and add-in macros that offer ideas about
      combining Microsoft Excel 3.0 features to create powerful
      worksheets, macros, and models.

      Option 6. Microsoft Excel Solver: This option installs Microsoft
      Excel Solver, an easy-to-use companion application that allows
      for linear programming capability and complex "what-if"
      analysis.

      Option 7. Q+E: This option installs Q+E (TM), a powerful and
      easy-to-use database application that allows you to manipulate
      and update database files from a variety of database systems,
      including dBASE(R) and Microsoft SQL Server.

      For more information on installing Microsoft Excel 3.0, please
      see page 4 of the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide" for version
      3.0.
