The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you print a worksheet or a chart or view a worksheet or a chart in
print preview in Microsoft Excel 97, patterns applied to drawing objects
and AutoShapes may be printed differently from identical patterns applied
to other objects, such as worksheet cells and chart series.
<P>
Specifically, the following problems may occur:

<UL><LI>Patterns applied to chart series are not printed at all. Instead, the
   chart series are printed with a solid gray fill.

<LI>Patterns applied to worksheet cells or chart series are printed
   darker and with more contrast than identical patterns applied to
   drawing objects and AutoShapes.
<P>
</UL>Note that these problems may occur even if the worksheet or chart sheet
does not contain any drawing objects or AutoShapes.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because of a difference in the way that Microsoft Excel
97 "renders" objects when you print a worksheet or chart or view a
worksheet or chart in print preview. Drawing objects and AutoShapes use one
rendering system, while all other objects use another rendering system.
This may cause identical patterns applied to different objects to be
printed differently. This problem is especially noticeable if the colors
you use in the patterns do not contrast with each other.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Although there is no way to completely prevent these problems from
occurring, you can minimize their effects by doing any of the following:

<UL><LI>When you format objects in the worksheet or chart, use solid colors
   whenever possible.
<P>
   The problems described in this article do not occur when you use solid
   colors.

<LI>If you must apply a pattern to an object, use white as one of the two
   colors.

<LI>If possible, use two colors that contrast with each other.
<P>
   For example, red and yellow contrast well with each other; sky blue and
   aqua do not.

<LI>Before you print the worksheet or chart, use print preview to view
   the printed output.
<P>
   You can then reformat objects in the worksheet or chart as required.
   This step helps save paper and reduce unnecessary printer usage.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
