<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions earlier than version 5.0, you must follow a
special procedure to sum amounts of time that exceed 24 hours. This is
because of the way Microsoft Excel calculates and displays time.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel versions 5.0 and later, you can format a cell containing 
the sum formula with the number format "[h]:mm:ss"; Microsoft Excel 
automatically adds times beyond 24 hours and formats them correctly.
<P>
To add times that collectively exceed 24 hours, use the appropriate
formula below.
<P>
<P><h3>Decimal Output</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to add times when the total of the times exceeds 24 hours, use
the following array formula:
<P>
<PRE>   =SUM(Range*24)

</PRE>NOTE: The above formula must be entered as an array formula. To enter a
formula as an array formula in Microsoft Excel for Windows or Microsoft
Excel for OS/2, press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. In Microsoft Excel for the
Macintosh, press COMMAND+ENTER. (Additional information about entering an
array formula is available in Help. On the Help menu, click Search for Help 
and type "array formula" in the dialog box. Click the Show Topics button to 
view the available topics.)
<P>
Or, enter the following formula as a regular worksheet formula:
<P>
<PRE>   =SUM(Range)*24

</PRE>NOTE: A cell that contains either of these formulas should be formatted in
either the General format or in a decimal format, not in a time format.
<P>
<P><h3>Text Output</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to add times when the total exceeds 24 hours, and you want
the total to appear in the "h:mm" format, use the following formula:
<P>
<PRE>   =TRUNC(SUM(Range*24))&amp;":"&amp;TEXT(MOD(SUM(Range*24),1)*60,"00")

</PRE>NOTE: This formula must be entered as an array formula. To enter a formula
as an array formula in Microsoft Excel for Windows or Microsoft Excel for
OS/2, press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, press
COMMAND+ENTER.
<P>
<P><h3>Text Output in h:mm:ss Format</h3>
 
<P>
The following formula displays the result of the addition of times in
h:mm:ss format as a text string:
<P>
<PRE>   =TRUNC(SUM(Range*24))&amp;":"&amp;TEXT(MINUTE(SUM(Range)),"00")&amp;":"&amp;
      TEXT(SECOND(SUM(Range)),"00")

</PRE>NOTE: This formula must be entered as an array formula. To enter a formula
as an array formula in Microsoft Excel for Windows or Microsoft Excel for
OS/2, press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. In Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, press
COMMAND+ENTER.
<P>
<P><h3>Time Output in [h]:mm:ss Format (Microsoft Excel 5.0 and later)</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 5.0, 7.0, and Microsoft Excel 97, you can add times with 
a sum that exceeds 24 hours by using a normal sum formula:
<P>
<PRE>   =SUM(Range)

</PRE>Then, click Cells on the Format menu, click the Number tab, and choose the
following number format:
<P>
<PRE>   [h]:mm:ss

</PRE>This format works correctly with times that exceed 24 hours.
<P>
NOTE: In all five of the above formulas, Range is either the defined name 
of a range that contains the times or the cell reference of the range that
contains your times (for example, A1:A4). The values in the range must be
in the "h:mm" or "hh:mm" format.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel uses a serial numbering system to calculate dates and
times. In this system, a single day is equal to 1 unit of time. Because an
hour is equal to 1/24th of a day, the serial number equivalent of one hour
is .041667 (1 day divided by 24 hours in a day). Following the same logic,
the serial number equivalent of one minute is .0006944 (1 day divided by
1,440 minutes in a day), and the serial number equivalent of one second is
1.1574E-05 (1 day divided by 86,400 seconds in a day).
<P>
When you add times in Microsoft Excel, the serial number equivalents of the 
times are added and the result is displayed in a time format. However, only 
the fractional amount of the result (time less than 24 hours) can be
displayed in a time format. As a result, your answer may be incorrect by a
multiple of 24 hours. For example, if you add the following times
<P>
<PRE>   Cell       Time     Serial Equivalent (Days)
   ----       -----    ------------------------

   A1         8:00     0.3333
   A2         9:00     0.375
   A3         10:00    0.4167
   A4         11:30    0.4792
              -----    ------
   Expected 
   Total      38:30    1.6042

</PRE>the expected result is 38:30. However, the result that is displayed is
14:30. This is because only the amount to the right of the decimal point
(.6042) is used by the time format. The amount to the left of the decimal
point (1) is in days, and is therefore not displayed when a built-in time
format is used. When formatted using the h:mm or hh:mm format, .6042 is
displayed as "14:30" (without the quotation marks).
<P>
The following three examples use the formulas described in the "Summary"
section of this article to accumulate times over 24 hours.
<P>
<P><h3>Example Using Decimal Output</h3>
 
<P>
Using the above example times, if you enter the formula
<P>
<PRE>   =SUM(A1:A4*24)

</PRE>as an array formula, or the regular formula
<P>
<PRE>   =SUM(A1:A4)*24

</PRE>you will receive 38.5 as a result. The integer portion of the result, 38,
represents the number of hours; and the fractional portion, .5, represents
the fraction of an hour (.5 * 1 hour = 30 minutes).
<P>
You can use this number in other computations, if necessary, but it is not
possible to display this number in an "h:mm" or "hh:mm" format without
using another formula to convert the number into text.
<P>
<P><h3>Example Using Text Output</h3>
 
<P>
Again using the above sample times, if you enter the formula
<P>
<PRE>   =TRUNC(SUM(A1:A4*24))&amp;":"&amp;TEXT(MOD(SUM(A1:A4*24),1)*60,"00")

</PRE>as an array formula, you will receive the text string "38:30" as a result.
Although this has the appearance of a number that uses the "h:mm" format,
it is not a number; that is, you cannot perform computations with this
number.
<P>
<P><h3>Example Using [h]:mm:ss Output</h3>
 
<P>
Again using the above sample times, if you enter the formula
<P>
<PRE>   =SUM(A1:A4)

</PRE>and then format the cell with the number format "[h]:mm:ss", the cell will
display a properly formatted time of 38:30. This is a proper time and can
be used in other computations.
