<P>
This article contains information about the problems that are corrected by
the Excel 97 Auto Recalculation Patch, the requirements for installing the

<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q171339.htm">Q171339</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL97: Some Values Not Recalculated When Using Multiple
               Formulas

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q154134.htm">Q154134</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL97: Functions in Filled Formulas May Not Be Recalculated

</PRE>NOTE: The most current version of the patch, Xl8p2.exe, resolves both of
these issues and replaces the original patch, Xl8p1.exe.
<P>
<P><h3>What Do I Need to Install the Excel 97 Auto Recalculation Patch?</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel SR-1:
<P>
The Excel 97 Auto Recalculation Patch is designed to update only Microsoft
Excel 97 SR-1. You cannot update the original version of Microsoft Excel
97. If Microsoft Excel 97 SR-1 is not installed on your computer, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for information
about how to obtain and install Microsoft Excel 97 SR-1:

   TITLE     : OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1

</PRE>NOTE: You can also use the Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1)
Patch to update Microsoft Excel 97. For more information about obtaining
Office 97 SR-1, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE ID: <B><A HREF="../OFFICE/Q174422.htm">Q174422</A></B>
   TITLE     : OFF97: Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1 Patch Update

</PRE>Hard Disk Space:
<P>
The Excel 97 Auto Recalculation Patch also requires at least 5 megabytes
(MB) of available hard disk space.
<P>
<P><h3>How Do I Download the Excel 97 Auto Recalculation Patch?</h3>
 
<P>
To download the patch, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use a Web browser to go to the following Microsoft Web site:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/office/excel/enhancements/xl8p1.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/office/excel/enhancements/xl8p1.asp</A></B>
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click Download Now.
<P>
</OL>Either run the patch directly from the Microsoft Web site or click Save To
Disk, save the file to the desktop, and then run it. If you save the file
to the desktop, run the patch by double-clicking it.
<P>
<P><h3>How Do I Install the Excel 97 Auto Recalculation Patch?</h3>
 
<P>
When you run the patch, it automatically determines the location of the
Microsoft Excel program file, Excel.exe, patches the program file, and then
displays a message that indicates whether Microsoft Excel SR-1 has been
successfully updated. The entire process takes only a couple of seconds.
<P>
To run the patch, copy the Xl8p2.exe file to the computer on which
Microsoft Excel 97 SR-1 is installed, and then double-click the file.
<P>
When you run the Excel 97 Auto Recalculation Patch, you can also use the
switches that are listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   Switch                   Definition
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   /p &lt;path to Excel.exe&gt;   The path to Excel.exe (in quotation marks). The
                            maximum length of the path is 256 characters.

                            Example: /p "C:\MyApps\Excel.exe"

                            Use this switch if the patch fails to update
                            Excel.exe. It is possible that the patch could
                            not determine the location of the Excel.exe
                            file.

   /s                       Silent mode. No message is displayed when you
                            install the patch in silent mode.

                            Example: /s

</PRE></OL>NOTE: After you install the patch, the recalculation problem may still
occur in workbooks the first time you open them. If this problem occurs,
press CTRL+ALT+F9. When you do this, the problem no longer occurs in that
workbook. However, it may be necessary to repeat this step for each
workbook the first time you open it.
<P>
<P><h3>How Can I Determine Whether the Excel 97 Auto Recalculation Patch Has Been</h3>
 
<P><h3>Successfully Installed?</h3>
 
<P>
When you run the Excel 97 Auto Recalculation Patch, a log file named
Xl8p2.log is created in the same folder that contains Excel.exe. You can
open this log file to determine whether installation of the patch is
successful. If installation is successful, the status message in the log
file is similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Excel 97 Auto Recalculation Patch - Patch RUP 15120002
   Microsoft Excel has been patched successfully.

</PRE>In addition, you can determine whether you have successfully installed
the patch by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use Windows Explorer to locate the Excel.exe file. The default location
   for this file is the following folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If you are running Microsoft Excel 97 from a network server,
   Excel.exe is located on the network server.

<P><LI>Right-click Excel.exe. On the shortcut menu, click Properties. Click
   the Version tab.
<P>
</OL>The number next to File Version is one of versions listed in the following
table.
<P>
<PRE>   File version   Version of Microsoft Excel 97
   ---------------------------------------------------------

   8.0            Microsoft Excel 97 (original version)
   8.0a           Microsoft Excel 97 SR-1
   8.0b           Microsoft Excel 97 SR-1 with Excel 97 Auto
                  Recalculation Patch (Xl8p1.exe)
   8.0c           Microsoft Excel 97 SR-1 with the updated Excel 97
                  Auto Recalculation Patch (Xl8p2.exe)

</PRE></OL>If the version number is 8.0c, you have successfully patched Microsoft
Excel 97 SR-1.
<P>
<P><h3>Is There Anything Else I Need to Know About Using the Excel 97 Auto</h3>
 
<P><h3>Recalculation Patch?</h3>
 

<UL><LI>You cannot update Microsoft Excel 97 SR-1 if you have performed a Run
   From CD installation of Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft Office 97.
   However, if the Run From CD installation was performed over a network
   from a CD that was shared with Full Access, the patch may incorrectly
   report that Microsoft Excel 97 was successfully patched.

<LI>If Microsoft Excel 97 is run from an administrative installation point,
   your network administrator must install the patch. When the network
   administrator does this, the administrator should use the /p switch
   followed by the path to Excel.exe on the network server. For more
   information about this switch, see the "How Do I Install the Excel 97
   Auto Recalculation Patch?" section.

<LI>If you have viewed a Microsoft Excel workbook in a Web browser, it
   may be necessary to quit the Web browser BEFORE you install the patch.
   Save the patch to the desktop, quit the browser program, and then
   install the patch.

<LI>If the Excel.exe file is read-only, the patch fails. To work around
   this problem, remove the read-only attribute from the Excel.exe file,
   install the patch, and then reset the read-only attribute.
