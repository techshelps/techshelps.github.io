<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to open, close, or save a workbook, the following error
message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, an error message similar to one of the following
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE at 0137:3001b963.

   -or-

   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module KERNEL32.DLL at
   0137:3001b693.

</PRE>When you click Close, Microsoft Excel quits.
<P>
In addition, if you can open the workbook, it contains two worksheets named
***** (five asterisks) for which the visible property is set to
xlveryhidden.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs after you scan and clean Microsoft Excel workbooks with
an antivirus software program. The problem occurs when the file becomes
damaged while you are cleaning the workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you cannot open the workbook, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q142117.htm">Q142117</A></B>
   TITLE     : Excel: Summary of Methods to Recover Data from Corrupted
               Files

</PRE>If you can open the workbook, use either of the following methods to repair
the damaged workbook.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Copy Data to a New Workbook</h3>
 
<P>
Open the damaged workbook and follow these steps to recover the data:

<OL><P><LI>Open a new workbook.

<P><LI>In the first worksheet in the damaged workbook, select the cells
   that contain data and click Copy.

<P><LI>In the new workbook, paste the data into a worksheet.
<P>
   Repeat steps 1 through 3 for each worksheet in the damaged workbook.

<P><LI>Save the new workbook as a new file.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Remove the Damaged Worksheets</h3>
 
<P>
You can remove the problematic worksheets from your workbook by running the
following Visual Basic for Applications procedure. The damaged sheets are
hidden and named *****. Note that you cannot unhide and delete these
manually without causing an invalid page fault.
<P>
IMPORTANT: Because Excel 97 cannot remove the corrupt files, you must run
this procedure in either Excel version 5.0 or 7.0.
