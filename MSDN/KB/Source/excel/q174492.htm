</PRE>To workaround this problem, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Delete the Wizard command bar by running a procedure, and then use the code
from the Help file. To remove the command bar, use the following code:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Remove_Wizard()
   
      Set oToolMenu = CommandBars("Worksheet Menu Bar").Controls("Tools")
      oToolMenu.Controls("Wizard").Delete
   
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Remove the Wizard command bar by using the Add-Ins dialog box. To do this,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Add-Ins.

<P><LI>Click to clear the Conditional Sum Wizard, File Conversion Wizard,
   Lookup Wizard, and Web Form Wizard check boxes.
<P>
   NOTE: It's possible that not all of these add-ins are selected. These
   four add-ins are included with Excel. If you installed a new add-in that
   appears on the Wizard command bar, it may be necessary to remove it.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
Remove the Small Business Financial Manager add-in. To do this, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Add-Ins.

<P><LI>Click to clear the Small Business Financial Manager check box.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The procedure in the Help file does not work in Excel because the Wizard
shortcut command bar cannot be deleted by using this method.
<P>
<P><h3>Restoring the Wizard Command Bar</h3>
 
<P>
To restore the Wizard command bar, follow these steps. If you removed the
Wizard command bar through the Add-Ins dialog box, skip steps 1 through 3.

<P><LI>Click to clear the Conditional Sum Wizard, File Conversion Wizard,
   Lookup Wizard, and Web Form Wizard check boxes.

<P><LI>Click OK.
