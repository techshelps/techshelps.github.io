</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel can call routines that have been compiled as code
resources (sometimes referred to as dynamic link libraries, or DLLs).
<P>
Code resources are called from macros and operate much like function
macros.
<P>
Before a resource can be called, it must first be registered to
Microsoft Excel using the REGISTER command. The REGISTER command loads
the code resource into memory and defines the parameters that the
resource will accept and return.
<P>
<P><h3>REGISTER Command</h3>
 
<P>
The following is the format of the REGISTER command:
<P>
<PRE>   REGISTER(file_name,resource_name,argument_types)

</PRE>"file_name" is the name of the file containing the code resource.
Microsoft Excel looks in the active directory for the file containing
the code resource, unless a pathname is specified.
<P>
"resource_name" is the name given to the code resource when it is
compiled. You must always specify a resource name, even if there is
only one code resource in the file.
<P>
"argument_types" is a text string specifying the argument type passed
to Microsoft Excel and the argument types passed from Microsoft Excel
to the code resource. Note that the first character specifies the
argument passed from the resource to Microsoft Excel, and the
subsequent characters specify the arguments passed from Microsoft
Excel to the code resource.
<P>
When the resource is successfully registered, the value of the cell
containing the REGISTER command is a text string that is used by the
CALL command. A registered command can be called multiple times.
<P>
Once registered, the code resource is called using the CALL command.
<P>
<P><h3>CALL Command</h3>
 
<P>
The following is the format of the CALL command:
<P>
<PRE>   CALL(call_text,argument1,argument2,...)

</PRE>"call_text" is the value returned by the REGISTER command. It is
almost always a reference to the cell containing the REGISTER command.
<P>
"argument1,argument2,..." is a list of up to 13 arguments passed from
Excel to the code resource. These arguments must match in number and
type the arguments specified in the REGISTER command. For buffers
passed to the resource, a comma is used with no argument.
<P>
When the resource is no longer used, it should be unregistered using
the UNREGISTER command to free memory taken by the resource.
<P>
<P><h3>UNREGISTER Command</h3>
 
<P>
The following is the format of the UNREGISTER command:
<P>
<PRE>   UNREGISTER(call_text)

</PRE>"call_text" is the value returned by the REGISTER command and is
almost always a reference to the cell containing the REGISTER command.
<P>

the following words:
<P>
<PRE>   description and creating and code and resource and call and
   register and routine and problems and floating and point and
   decimal

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For more information on the CALL, REGISTER, and UNREGISTER commands,
see pages 201, 266-267, and 289, respectively, in the "Microsoft Excel
Functions and Macros" version 2.2 manual.
