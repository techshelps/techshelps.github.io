XL5: Custom Default Chart Format Not Applied to Embedded Chart
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q110829.htm">Q110829</A></B>

<P>
In Microsoft Excel version 5.0 for Windows, you may receive a general

OnSheetDeactivate command and the macro then closes the workbook in which
it is contained.
<P>
 
XL5: "Cannot Find Macro..." Using Run Method with Add-In Macro
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q112219.htm">Q112219</A></B>

the Application object to run a macro located in an add-in, you may receive
the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '1004':

   Cannot find macro '&lt;ADDIN.XLA&gt;!&lt;Addin_Macro&gt;'

workbook is a chart or a module, even if the active workbook does
contain defined names.
<P>

now contains the value of the function, but the function is gone.
<P>
 
XL5: Formatting and Charts Not Saved to .WQ1 Format
Article ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q110708.htm">Q110708</A></B>

refers to is the value you defined for the global name and the global name
is not defined on the workbook.
