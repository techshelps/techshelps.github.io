The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you share a workbook or open a shared workbook,
you receive a User Identification dialog box with the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Welcome to the Shared List feature in Microsoft Excel.

   Please enter your name below so you can be identified to other users who
   are sharing workbooks with you:

</PRE>The name that appears in this dialog box is the name that was entered when
Microsoft Excel was installed on this computer. If you enter another name
in this dialog box, this new name appears in the User Name box on the
General tab in the Options dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Excel. When you share a workbook,
or open a shared workbook for the first time, Microsoft Excel prompts you
for the name that you want displayed as the name of the user that has this
workbook open (on the Status tab in the Shared Lists dialog box). However,
if you enter a name in the User Identification dialog box that is different
from the name in the User Name box on the General tab in the Options dialog
box, the name that you enter replaces the User Name value.
<P>
If you are using another person's computer, this may not be the desired
behavior. The value in the User Name field is used as the default value in
the Author box in the Properties dialog box for all new files created in
Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid changing the User Name in this copy of Microsoft Excel, accept the
name that appears in the User Identification dialog box when you share a
workbook or open a shared workbook for the first time.
<P>
To change the User Name value back to the original name, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the General tab.

<P><LI>In the User Name box, enter the name that you want to be used as the
   default Author field value in all new files.
<P>
</OL>Note that once you enter a value in the User Identification dialog box, you
are not prompted for this name again. After the first time you share a
workbook or open a shared workbook, the name in the User Name box in the
Options dialog box is used to identify who has the file open.
