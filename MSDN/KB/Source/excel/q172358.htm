The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, when you open a workbook that contains a chart, you
may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module MSO97.DLL at
   0137:30705766.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The workbook contains one or more chart sheets or charts that are
   embedded in worksheets.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You use the Save As/Export command in Microsoft Access 97 to export a
   table into the workbook.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>In Microsoft Excel 97, you click Save As and click Microsoft Excel
   Workbook (*.xls) in the Save As dialog box.
<P>
</UL>If this problem occurs, you cannot open the workbook.
<P>
NOTE: The problem described in the "Symptoms" section in this article does
not occur if you export a table from Microsoft Access 97 into a workbook
that is saved in the Microsoft Excel 5.0 or 7.0 format.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
It may be possible to recover data in the workbook if you follow the steps
in the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q142117.htm">Q142117</A></B>
   TITLE     : Excel: Summary of Methods to Recover Data from Corrupted
               Files

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q147216.htm">Q147216</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL: Linking to Data in a Damaged File (5.0 and Later)

</PRE>To prevent this problem, use the following steps to export the table into
the workbook.
<P>
CAUTION: If you follow these steps, certain features that are supported in
only Microsoft Excel 97, such as UserForms, class modules, and code
associated with sheets, may not be saved with the workbook. Use the
following steps with caution:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Excel 97, open the workbook.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As. In the Save As Type list, click
   Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 Workbook (*.xls) and click Save.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Close.

<P><LI>In Microsoft Access 97, select the table that you want to export. Then,
   click Save As/Export on the File menu.

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, click "To an External File or Database."
   Then, click OK.

<P><LI>In the Save As Type list, click Microsoft Excel 5-7. In the list of
   files, click the Microsoft Excel workbook to which you want to export
   the table. Then, click Export.

<P><LI>In Microsoft Excel 97, reopen the workbook.
<P>
</OL>The exported table appears in the workbook as a new sheet tab.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The problem described in this article occurs because Microsoft Access 97
incorrectly writes information to workbooks saved in the Microsoft Excel 97
workbook format. If the workbook contains charts, the charts are not saved
correctly by Microsoft Access 97, and you cannot open the workbook. This
problem does not occur when you use Microsoft Access 97 to make changes to
a workbook saved in the Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 Workbook (*.xls) format.
