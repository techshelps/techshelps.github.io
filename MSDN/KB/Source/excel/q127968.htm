<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to work around this problem by decompressing or extracting
the original version of the Stdole.tlb file from the appropriate Microsoft
Excel 5.0, Office 4.2, or Office 4.3 disk to the Windows\System directory.
<P>
To decompress or extract the Stdole.tlb file, use the following
appropriate steps:
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel 5.0c</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Extract utility, Extract.exe, to manually extract the file from
the Microsoft Excel .cab file that is located on the appropriate Microsoft
Excel Setup disk.
<P>
The Stdole.tlb file is located on the following disks in the following
.cab files.
<P>
Microsoft Office:
<P>
The .cab files that contain Stdole.tlb are listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   Version of Office    Disk format  Disk number     File
   -------------------------------------------------------------

   4.3                  DMF          23              Msoff23.cab
   4.3                  Non-DMF      32              Msoff32.cab
   4.2                  DMF          19              Msoff19.cab
   4.2                  Non-DMF      26              Msoff26.cab

</PRE>Microsoft Excel:
<P>
The .cab files that contain Stdole.tlb are listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   Disk type     Disk number     File
   ----------------------------------------

   DMF           1               Excel1.cab
   3.5-inch      1               Excel1.cab
   5.25-inch     1               Excel1.cab
   720k          2               Excel2.cab

</PRE>To extract the file from the disk, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy Extract.exe from Setup Disk 1 to the root directory on the local
   hard disk, or to a directory that is located in the PATH statement in
   the Autoexec.bat file.

<P><LI>Insert the Setup disk that contains the Stdole.tlb file in the
   floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      extract /y &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;directory&gt;\&lt;.cab file&gt; /L c:\&lt;windows&gt;\system\
      stdole.tlb
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive that contains the Setup Disk, &lt;.cab file&gt; is
   the .cab file that contains the Stdole.tlb file that you want to
   extract, and &lt;windows&gt; is the Microsoft Windows directory on drive C.
<P>
   Note that you can use the /y switch to overwrite the existing
   compressed file without prompting. The space before the file name is
   required to properly extract the new file and overwrite the existing
   file.
<P>
</OL><h3>Microsoft Excel 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using Microsoft Excel 5.0, use the Decomp utility, Decomp.exe,
to manually decompress the file from the appropriate Microsoft Excel Setup
disk. Decomp.exe is available on the Microsoft Excel Setup Disk 1.
<P>
The disks that contain Stdole.tlb are listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   Disk type     Disk number
   -------------------------

   3.5-inch      7
   5.25-inch     9
   720k          9

</PRE></OL>To decompress the file, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy Decomp.exe to the root directory of the local hard drive, or to a
   directory that is located in the PATH statement in the Autoexec.bat
   file.

<P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Excel Setup disk that contains the Stdole.tlb file
   in the disk drive.

<P><LI>If you are using the stand-alone version of Microsoft Excel, type the
   following command at the MS-DOS prompt and press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      decomp -f &lt;drive&gt;:\stdole.tl_ c:\windows\system\stdole.tlb
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive that contains the Microsoft Excel Setup disk
   that contains the (uncompressed) Stdole.tl_ file.
<P>
   You can use the -f switch to overwrite the existing uncompressed file
   without prompting.
<P>
   If you are using the version of Microsoft Excel that comes with
   Microsoft Office 4.3-CD, type the following command at the MS-DOS
   prompt and press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      extract /y d:\setup.adm\disk32\msoff32.cab /L c:\windows\system
      stdole.tlb
</PRE><P>
</OL>If you are running Windows from a shared directory on a network, you may
need to copy the Stdole.tlb file to any or all of the following
directories:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows\System (on the network)
   Windows (on the local computer)
   Windows\System (on the local computer; create it if it does not
   already exist)

</PRE></OL>In some cases, you may need to rename and extract Ole2conv.dll,
Ole2disp.dll, Ole2nls.dll, Compobj.dll, and Storage.dll to correct the
problem. You can find these files on the same disk that contains
Stdole.tlb. To extract the files, use the steps in this article.
