The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are a network administrator, you may want use a batch method to
update users' REG.DAT files. For example, you may want to do this if you
want all network users to move their object library (.OLB) files to their
local workstations.
<P>
For information about a situation in which you would want to use this
method, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCEL/Q120404.htm">Q120404</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL5: "File Not Found" Error Using References Dialog Box

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To have users update references in the Windows registration database file,
REG.DAT, use the steps below to create a .REG file.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a .REG File</h3>
 
<P>
To correct this type of problem for many workstations, you can create and
distribute a .REG file to the users that have the problem. The users can
double-click the .REG file in Windows File Manager to automatically update
the REG.DAT entry. A .REG file that you create must follow certain
requirements in order to update the REG.DAT file correctly:

<UL><LI>The file be in ASCII text.

<LI>The word REGEDIT must be the only word on the first line of the file.

<LI>The additional lines of the file include a "path" to the key to be
   updated and a value for that key.
<P>
</UL><h3>Example .REG file</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft does not support customer modifications to the REG.DAT file. You
should use caution when you make changes to the Windows registration
database. Always make a backup copy of the REG.DAT file before you change
it. Microsoft provides this example for illustration only, without warranty
either expressed or implied, including but not limited to the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This
example is provided "as is" and Microsoft in no way guaranties that the
following information can be used in all situations.
<P>
The following is an example of a file that can be used to update the
entries for the XLEN50.OLB file and the VBAEN.OLB file discussed above.

<OL><P><LI>In a text editor, such as Notepad, enter the following text in a new
   file.
<P>
<P><PRE>      REGEDIT
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{00020813-0000-0000-C000-
      000000000046}\1.0\9\win16 = C:\EXCEL\XLEN50.OLB
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{000204F3-0000-0000-C000-
      000000000046}\1.0\9\win16 = C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\VBAEN.OLB
</PRE><P>
   Note that in the above example, the directories C:\EXCEL and
   C:\WINDOWS must be the Microsoft Excel directory and the
   Microsoft Windows directory respectively on the users workstation.

<P><LI>Save the file as CORRECT.REG. (Note that you can give this file any
   valid MS-DOS filename. However, in order for the file to be associated
   with the registration database by default, you should give the file the
   extension .REG).

<P><LI>Distribute the file to the users who are experiencing this problem.

<P><LI>To correct the problem, the user must double-click the .REG file in File
   Manager to merge this information into the Registration Database file on
   their computer.
<P>
</OL>NOTES:
<P>
<PRE>   The formatting of this article may force the example entries above to
   wrap to the following line. All entries in the .REG file must be entered
   on a single line. In the above example, a blank line is inserted between
   each entry.

   There are 10 zeros in the above numeric sequence "000000000046". Failure
   to enter this information EXACTLY as shown above will result in the
   creation of a NEW ENTRY in your REG.DAT file, and the desired result
   will not be achieved. (It is most likely that no error message will be
   given, and no adverse effects will occur.)

   There should be a carriage return character at the end of every line of
   text.
