The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the versions of Microsoft Excel listed at the beginning of this article,
the bottom rows of text in a cell may not be visible (they are cut off),
even though the cell is formatted with a vertical alignment of Bottom.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if the cell is not large enough to display all of the
text it contains.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, use any of the following methods to
size the cell so that it can display all of the text it contains:

<UL><LI>Increase the column width of the cell. To do this, select the cell,
   click the Format menu, point to Column, and click Width. Increase the
   column width and click OK.

<LI>Increase the row height of the cell. To do this, select the cell,
   click the Format menu, point to Row, and click Height. Increase the row
   height and click OK.

<LI>Use the AutoFit feature to allow Microsoft Excel to automatically
   determine the correct column width or row height to use. To use
   AutoFit, select the cell, click the Format menu, point to Column or
   Row, and click AutoFit.

<LI>Reduce the amount of text contained in the cell so that it is displayed
   without resizing the cell.
<P>
</UL>Note that if you set the vertical alignment of the cell to Top, the top
rows of text in the cell are visible even if the cell is not large enough
to display all of the text it contains.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, there are a number of vertical alignments that you can
apply to cells: for example, Top, Bottom, and Center.
<P>
If you format a cell to use a vertical alignment of Top, the text is
aligned with the top of the cell. If the cell contains too much text, the
bottom rows of text are truncated by the bottom of the cell. This is by
design of Microsoft Excel and is correct behavior.
<P>
However, if you format the same cell to use a vertical alignment of Bottom,
the text is not correctly aligned with the bottom of the cell if the cell
contains too much text. If you increase the size of the cell or if you
reduce the amount of text in the cell, the text is correctly aligned with
the bottom of the cell.
