The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, after you make changes to a document, you may get
the following message when you attempt to close the file:
<P>
<PRE>   Save Changes in 'name.xls'?

</PRE>After you choose Yes, the Save Worksheet As dialog box may appear and
prompt you to enter a new filename.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The second dialog box may appear for the following are reasons:

<OL><P><LI>The file was imported into Microsoft Excel in another file format
   (such as text). You may have saved the file with an .XLS
   extension. For example, if you change the filename NAME.TXT to
   NAME.XLS in the Save Worksheet As dialog box, the underlying
   format is not changed and Microsoft Excel still considers it to be
   a text file.
<P>
   To correctly save to a Normal format:
<P>
   a. From the File menu, choose Save As.
   b. Type the name of your document, excluding the .XLS extension.
   c. Choose Options.
   d. Select Normal from the File Format list box and choose OK.

<P><LI>The file was originally saved in a format other than Normal.
   Microsoft Excel will prompt you with the Save Worksheet As dialog
   box each time you make changes and close your worksheet, giving you
   the chance to save it in a Normal format. File formats other than
   Normal will not save changes to the worksheet if that format does
   not support the changes you made. Microsoft Excel feels it is
   important that you are aware your file is not in the Normal format.

<P><LI>The file was saved as a template (with the extension .XLT). The
   purpose of a template is to retain the original template file, so
   that when changes are made to it, Microsoft Excel will prompt you
   for a new filename to prevent you from overwriting your template.

<P><LI>The file is marked with a read-only attribute. If the file is
   read-only, Excel will display "[Read-Only]" next to the filename at
   the top of the open document.
<P>
   To change the attribute so that changes can be made to the file
   without giving it another name:
<P>
   a. Start File Manager in Windows 3.0.
   b. Highlight the read-only file.
   c. From the File menu, choose Change Attributes.
   d. Cancel the selection of Read Only.
