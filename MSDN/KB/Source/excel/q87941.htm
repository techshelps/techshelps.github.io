1. Q. How can I print a part of my worksheet, either a row or a
      column, on every page?

   A. To print a column or a row of information on every page, click
      the row numbers or column letters of the titles you want to
      print. From the Options menu, choose Set Print Titles. Select
      the range of data you want to print, excluding the rows or
      columns you have designated as print titles. From the Options
      menu, choose Set Print Area.

      For more information regarding print titles, please refer to
      pages 530-531 of the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide" for version
      3.0.

2. Q. I am trying to print an Excel worksheet. Everything prints
      correctly except my print titles appear twice on the first page
      of the printout. How can I correct this?

   A. You have set print titles without having a defined print area.
      To correct this, select the data you want to print, excluding
      the rows or columns you have designated as print titles. From
      the Options menu, choose Set Print Area.

      To determine which rows or columns were designated as print
      titles, follow the next three steps:

      Step 1. From the Formula menu, choose Define Name.

      Step 2. In the Define Name dialog box, select the Print_Titles
      name.

      Step 3. Once you select the name, the rows or columns that are
      defined as print titles appear in the Refers To box.

      For more information regarding print titles, please refer to
      pages 530-531 of the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide" for version
      3.0.

3. Q. I am trying to print my entire worksheet, but every time I view
      it in print preview or on a printout, I see only a portion. What
      am I doing wrong?

   A. You may have already set a print area for this document by
      mistake. To reset the print area, select the entire worksheet by
      pressing COMMAND+A, then choose Remove Print Area from the
      Options menu.

      For more information regarding print sections of a worksheet,
      please refer to pages 540-541 of the "Microsoft Excel User's
      Guide" for version 3.0.
