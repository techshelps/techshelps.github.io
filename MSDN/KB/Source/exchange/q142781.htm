The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
- Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, you can
hide a recipient mailbox from the Address Book. If this is done, the
mailbox will not show up in any Microsoft Exchange database table. This
means the mailbox will not appear in the Global Address List, in any
hierarchy container, as a member of a Distribution List, or as a manager or
direct report. Also, except in the case when the Distinguished Name (DN) of
the mailbox is used, the mailbox will not be suggested as a possible
Ambiguous Name Resolution match.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The only way to select a hidden mailbox is to use the Distinguished Name
(DN) for that mailbox. The DN is an address that is unique in the entire
organization. The following is an example of a DN:
<P>
<PRE>   /o=EXCHNG_ORG/ou=EXCHNG_SITE/cn=Container1/cn=Container2/cn=Alias

</PRE>In the above example:

<UL><LI>EXCHNG_ORG is the Exchange Organization Name.
<LI>EXCHNG_SITE is the Exchange Site Name.
<LI>Container1 and Container2 are Container names with Container2 being
   a subcontainer of Container1.
<LI>Alias is the mailbox alias name and is present in Container2.
<P>
</UL>The DN can be constructed if the above pieces of information are known.
<P>
The DN for a mailbox can also be obtained from the Raw Properties of the
mailbox.
<P>
WARNING: Using the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program in raw mode
should only be done under the direction of a Microsoft Exchange Support
Engineer. Incorrectly configuring the Administrator properties in raw mode
can cause serious, system-wide problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Exchange Server to correct them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
any problems resulting from the incorrect use of the Administrator program
in raw mode can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
To obtain the Raw Properties, follow the steps below:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Exchange Administrator Program using the /raw command line
   option.

<P><LI>Select the mailbox whose Raw Properties you want to obtain and then
   choose the Raw Properties command from the File menu. This will
   bring up a dialog box displaying the Raw Properties for that mailbox.

<P><LI>From the Object Attributes listbox, select the item called
   Obj-Dist-Name.

<P><LI>The DN for that mailbox should now be displayed in the field labeled
   Attribute Value.
<P>
</OL><h3>Mailing to a Hidden Recipient</h3>
 
<P>
In the Compose New Message To: box, type the DN for the recipient of the
message. On the Tools menu, click Check Names (or press CTRL+K). If the DN
corresponds to a valid mailbox, the DN will be replaced by the underlined
Display Name of the mailbox.
<P>
To add this address to the Personal Address Book, double-click the
underlined Display Name. This will bring up the Properties of the mailbox
in question. On the General Page of the Properties, click Personal Address
Book, which will add the address to the Personal Address Book. In the
future, the address can be selected from the Personal Address Book, instead
of typing in the DN for the mailbox.
<P>
The above procedure can also be used when you create an Inbox Assistant or
Public Folder rule involving a mailbox hidden from the Address Book.
