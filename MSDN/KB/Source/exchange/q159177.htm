The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 Service Pack 2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using the Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client 4.0 Service 
Pack 2 and you attempt to open an attachment in an e-mail message sent 
from the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, the following error message 
may be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   The application associated with this attachment could not be started.
   Verify the application is installed on your system with the correct
   directory path. &lt;path&gt;:\&lt;filename&gt;.BIN

</PRE>where &lt;path&gt; is the location of the Windows temporary folder and 
&lt;filename&gt; is the file name of the attachment that you are attempting to 
open. This problem may occur even if the attachment does not have a .bin 
extension.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to open an attachment in an e-mail message, the client 
attempts to locate the attachment's extension in the list of valid 
extensions under the following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Mac File Types

</PRE>If the extension is not in the list, the client attempts to open the 
MacBinary version of the attached file. If you are using the Microsoft 
Exchange Windows NT client 4.0 Service Pack 2, this causes the above 
error message to be displayed.
<P>
RESOLUTION
 
<P>
To work around this problem, add a new string value under the Mac File 
Types key for the type of file that is being sent as an attachment. To do 
so, use the following steps.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide 
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. 
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of 
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Determine the Creator and Type attributes for the file that is being 
   sent as an attachment. To determine a file's Creator and Type 
   attributes, use a utility designed for this purpose, for example, 
   ResEdit. For information about obtaining and using ResEdit or another 
   program designed for this purpose, contact Apple.

<P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Locate the following registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Mac File Types
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Add Value.

<P><LI>In the Value Name box, type &lt;creator&gt;:&lt;type&gt; and then a trailing space, 
   where &lt;creator&gt; is the file's Creator attribute and &lt;type&gt; is the 
   file's Type attribute. For example, if the file is a .bmp file, type 
   "8BIM:BMP " (without quotation marks).

<P><LI>In the Data Type box, verify that REG_SZ is selected, and then click 
   OK.

<P><LI>In the String box, type the file's extension, and then click OK. For 
   example, if the file is a .bmp file, type ".bmp" (without quotation 
   marks), and then click OK.

<P><LI>Quit and then restart the client.
<P>
</OL>If you are still unable to open the attachment, try saving the file to 
your hard disk instead of opening it in the e-mail message. If the file 
is saved with the correct extension, then the registry has been modified 
correctly. Verify that a program is associated with the extension in 
Windows NT.
<P>
If the file is not saved with the correct extension, then the registry 
has not been modified correctly. Verify that the string value for the 
type of file that is being sent as an attachment is correct. In 
particular, verify that the Creator and Type attributes are correct and 
that a trailing space appears after the Type attribute.
