<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT local groups should not be used for purposes of permission
assignment to Microsoft Exchange Site objects unless all Microsoft Exchange
Servers within the Microsoft Exchange Site are on domain controllers (DC's)
within the same domain.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program allows you to assign
permissions on Microsoft Exchange objects to Windows NT local groups
defined on the DC of the domain to which the Microsoft Exchange Server
belongs. The use of local groups can be a handy way of simplifying
permissions assignment in certain cases. However, local groups must not be
used to assign permissions in Microsoft Exchange unless all of the
Microsoft Exchange Servers within the Microsoft Exchange Site are DC's
within the same Windows NT domain.
<P>
The reason why local groups will not work when any Microsoft Exchange
Server is not on a DC is straightforward: Local groups under Windows NT are
valid for permissions assignment only for the computers upon which the
groups were defined. In the case of a DC, local groups defined on one DC
are valid for permissions assignment on all DC's in the domain (because all
DC's in a given domain share the same security database). However, local
groups defined on a member server are valid only for use upon the server
itself because the security database of a member server is unique to that
computer. As a result of this, if local groups defined on a DC are used to
assign permissions on a member server, the permissions thus defined cannot
be validated on that member server because it does not have full access to
the security database of the DC. The local groups are recognized, but
permissions assigned to them will not work.
<P>
In cases where local groups may be safely used, Microsoft Exchange
enumerates local groups on the DC of the Microsoft Exchange Server domain
in the permissions dialog box. However, you should take care not to use
local groups for permissions assignment if all of the Microsoft Exchange
Servers in your site are not on DC's within the same domain.
<P>
For maximum compatibility with any future changes you may make to your
Microsoft Exchange Site configuration, you should avoid the use of local
groups for permissions assignments entirely.
