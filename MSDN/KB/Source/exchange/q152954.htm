<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are running the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client on Windows
3.1 and using Novell’s NetWare IPX/SPX protocol stack, the following error
message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   A network error has occurred. Please contact your administrator.

</PRE>This usually happens when accessing the Address Book, trying to check
details of names in the Global Address Book, synchronizing local Schedule+
file to server, sending and receiving large attachments, or moving messages
from PST to server-based folder. It is also more likely to happen on Token
Ring.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The computer running Microsoft Exchange Server is sending packets that are
larger than the MaxFrameSize of the Windows 3.1 client.
<P>
When Windows 3.1 was written, there was only one interface with Novell's
IPX/SPX stack, using ECB's programmed with assembly language. ECBs only
support SPX I. SPX I does not allow packet size negotiation.
<P>
With the release of NetWare 4.x, another interface with Novell's IPX/SPX
stack was introduced, using TLI programmed with C.  TLI supports both SPX I
and SPX II.  SPX II does allow packet size negotiation.
<P>
Since Windows 3.1 was written before the TLI interface came out, it was
written to use ECBs, so its version of RPC can't negotiate packet sizes.
Therefore, the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server doesn't "know"
that the client's MaxFrameSize is not the same as its MaxFrameSize and it
sends packets that are too large for the client.
<P>
RESOLUTION
 
<P>
One possible workaround is to make sure the maximum frame size on the
Exchange clients is at least the same size a,s or up to 120 bytes larger
than, the maximum frame size on the computer running Microsoft Exchange
Server.
<P>
Windows 95 does not exhibit this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft does not plan to add TLI support to Windows 3.1.
