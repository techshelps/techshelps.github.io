The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A single thread in the Store.exe process is utilizing 90%-100% of the CPU 
processor time. This high utilization coincides with the start of Microsoft
Exchange Information Store (IS) Maintenance window (as configured by the IS 
Maintenance Schedule) and does not stop unless the Information Store Service 
is cycled or the computer itself is cycled.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
One of the checks during the IS Maintenance schedule is that of Public
Folder expires. During the IS maintenance run, the System (or Site) Folders
are also checked. These include the Offline Address Book, the Schedule+ Free
Busy folder, and the Organization Forms. In particular, the Schedule+ Free
Busy folder has a default 7 day expiry on it so it is checked during the 
expiry period of IS Maintenance. The function performing the expiry check on
the Schedule+ Free/Busy folder encounters a second copy of the folder in the 
deleted folders table and this causes the function to remain in a tight loop 
causing the high CPU utilization.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue a rebuild of the Site folders is necessary. To
rebuild the Site folders, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI> Obtain a copy of the utility Guidgen.exe. This utility is available in
<P><PRE>    the Microsoft Developers Network under the product samples. If you do
    not have access to this utility, Contact Microsoft Product Support
    Services. The Guidgen utility will randomly generate a globally unique
    identifier (UID) that will be used to rebuild the site folders.
</OL></PRE>2.  Run Guidgen and select Option 4, Registry Format.
3.  Click New GUID.
4.  Copy or write down the new GUID number from the RESULT box. This number
<PRE>    will be needed in Step 10.
</PRE></OL>5.  Run the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program in "raw" mode. To do
<PRE>    this, go to the command line, change to the Exchsrvr\Bin directory, and
    type "admin /r".
</PRE>6.  Select the Configuration container of the Site you want to rebuild and
<PRE>    highlight the Information Store Site Configuration object.
</PRE>7.  Select File, Raw Properties.
8.  In the Object Attributes window, scroll down to the Site Folder GUID
<PRE>    attribute and select it.
</PRE>9.  Click Editor.
10. Replace the existing GUID number with the one generated in Step 2 (the
<PRE>    value should be entered in hexadecimal) and then click OK.
</PRE>11. Click the SET button. After doing this, make sure the Edit Value
<PRE>    and Attribute Value are the same.
</PRE>12. Click OK to close the dialog box.
13. Stop and restart the Information Store service with the Networks tool
<PRE>    in Control Panel.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
