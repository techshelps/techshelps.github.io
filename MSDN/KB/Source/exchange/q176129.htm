The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to reply to a message that originates from a Defense
Messaging System (DMS) user whose mailbox has dual DDA fields defined in
its X.400 address, your reply is not received. Also, no non-delivery
report (NDR) is generated.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When dual DDAs are used, the DDA does not get mapped into the X.500
Distinguished Name (DN); it stays in the DDA field. Consequently, no DN
exists on the originator. In actuality, there is a DDA that is unknown to
the originator of the message.
<P>
The lack of an NDR in DMS occurs because the incoming reply is dropped at
the Multi-Function Interpreter (MFI), because there is no resolvable
address. The MFI, also referred to as Multifunction Gateway (MFG) allows
the translation of messages from one format to another. All connectivity
outside of DMS must go through the MFI so the message can be downgraded to
a non-DMS compliant message. The MFI provides gateway translation between
mail systems, including AUTODIN (JANAP128), ACP123 with P42 and P772,
ACP127 (NATO's version of AUTODIN), SMTP RFC822, SMTP/MSP, X.400 P2 and
P22, and other legacy systems as required.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge
