The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0 and 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The text of some MSMail messages received through the Internet Mail Service
may be incomplete when opened. Some or all of the message body may be
missing.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs when messages received through the Internet Mail Service have
embedded null characters in the body of the SMTP message stream. RFC1521
discourages the sending of control characters between systems that do not
have a private agreement. In Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 the Internet
Mail Connector (IMC) removes all null characters from messages received.
Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5 are written to more carefully preserve the
inbound message content, and they preserve null characters in the message
body.
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange MSMail Interchange (MSMI) is written with the
assumption that a null character marks the end of a message body. When the
MSMI sees the null character, it stops processing the message body that is
created for the MSMail client.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, change the originating mail message so that
null characters are not part of the message stream.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server versions
5.0 and 5.5.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has changed Exchange Server versions 5.0 and 5.5 to strip null
characters from the message body of received mail as Exchange Server 4.0
did.
