<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start a Microsoft Exchange client, you might observe that a search
is made for a file called Dcab32.dll on the network. This observation would
likely be made using a network sniffer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the Microsoft Exchange client loads the Address Book Provider DLL
(Emsabp32.dll), the DLL searches for the presence of Dcab32.dll to enable
Defense Messaging System (DMS) functionality. DMS is discussed in brief at
<B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/dms.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/dms.htm.</A></B> The search for Dcab32.dll will
ultimately use the search path in the attempt to find the DLL. If the
search path contains a network drive, this drive will also be searched.
It is normal for the commercial release of Microsoft Exchange to do this
search and fail to find the file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
For customers that do not want the Microsoft Exchange client to cause
network activity while starting due to the Dcab32.dll search, it is
recommended that network drives be removed from the search path. If network
drives cannot be removed, a stub DLL can be obtained from Microsoft with
the name Dcab32.dll that can be placed in the SYSTEM (on Win95) or SYSTEM32
(on NT) directory of the Microsoft Exchange client.  The DLL provides NO
DMS functionality, but it will be found by the Microsoft Exchange client
search (thereby terminating the search), prior to use of the search path.
<P>
When the Microsoft Exchange client determines that the DLL does not contain
DMS functionality, the client ignores it and continues loading.
