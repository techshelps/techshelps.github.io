</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Mail Connector interchange (MSMI) on Microsoft Exchange, when
acting as a gateway between MS Mail postoffices, sets the Reply-To of all
outbound messages to the MS Mail address of the Exchange user who is
sending the message, or of the custom recipient sending the message if a
custom recipient is defined for the originator of the message. This allows
the recipient a reliable path back to the originator.
<P>
This behavior may not be wanted with SNADS addresses as custom recipients.
When the recipient on MS Mail pulls up details about the originator of the
message, the recipient gets only the Network/postoffice/Username portion of
the address rather than the user's full SNADS address. The behavior in
question does not cause any problems with message flow or directory
synchronization. However, the behavior does not allow the recipient to
determine who sent the message if the sender has the same name as another
person in the e-mail environment.
<P>
For example, a customer has an Exchange Server computer (named SERVER1),
which has an MSMI connecting to an MS Mail postoffice (named SERVER1/PO1),
which has a SNADS gateway installed on it. The customer also has another
Exchange Server computer (named SERVER2), which has an MSMI connecting to
another MSMail postoffice (named SERVER2/PO1). All names from the SNADS
postoffices and the MS Mail postoffices are synchronized into Exchange.
<P>
<PRE>                                           MSMAIL      Exchange Server
  SNADS postoffices &lt;-&gt; SNADS GATEWAY &lt;-&gt; SERVER1/PO1 &lt;-&gt; SERVER1 &lt;-----\
                                                                        |
                                                              Exchange MTA
                                                                        |
                                            MSMAIL      Exchange Server |
                                          SERVER2/PO1 &lt;--&gt; SERVER2 &lt;----/

</PRE>Assume that SNADS postoffices all have a DGN/DEN according to where that
particular SNADS postoffice is located physically. For example, they have
one with DGN/DEN of EUROPE/PARIS and one with DGN/DEN of AUSTRALIA/SYDNEY.
Each of these two SNADS postoffices by chance has a user named Bob with a
SNADS address of EUROPE/PARIS/BOB and AUSTRALIA/SYDNEY/BOB respectively.
<P>
When these users are synchronized into Exchange, each receives a proxy-
generated MS Mail 10/10/10 address. Assuming the connector postoffice name
on SERVER1 is EXCHANGE, the first Bob receives an MS Mail proxy address of
SERVER1/EXCHANGE/BOB, and the second Bob receives an MSMail proxy address
of SERVER1/EXCHANGE/BOB2. (Assume that EUROPE/PARIS/BOB was imported
first.)
<P>
Assume that the SNADS user Bob (EUROPE/PARIS/BOB) sends a message to an
MSMail user named Mike on SERVER1/PO1. If Mike wishes to obtain information
about the originator of the message, the details of the sender are given as
the proxy-generated MS Mail 10/10/10 address of SERVER1/EXCHANGE/BOB, which
does not convey the location information represented in the SNADS address.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This feature is included in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query
on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 Service Pack 2 and later, you can
set a registry value to indicate to the MSMI that all messages outbound
that were originated by a custom address with a target address of type
SNADS are to be sent with the Reply-To set to the user's SNADS address
instead of the user's MS Mail (PC) type address.
MS Mail (PC) type address.
<P>
After setting this registry value, users who receive mail from a SNADS user
and get details on that user's address will see the user's DGN/DEN SNADS
style address instead of the user's proxy-generated 10/10/10. The downside
to this is each MSMail postoffice must have the SNADS Access Component
installed in order to reply to these messages.
<P>
To change the MSMI's behavior to send out the SNADS address as the Reply-To
instead of the proxy-generated 10/10/10, do the following:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot

can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
