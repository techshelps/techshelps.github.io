<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following checklist is intended as an aide in configuring a Microsoft
Exchange X.400 connector to a foreign X.400 Message Handling System (MHS).
This is not intended to replace observations on previously operational
connections that may point to the actual problem, but rather as a guide to
succesful configuration of between dissimilar Message Transfer Agents
(MTAs). The term 'host' refers to a computer that supports a MTA.

<OL><P><LI>Can each host ping the IP address of the other?
   No  - Resolve network issue.
   Yes - If you want to use the host name versus the ip address, proceed to
<PRE>         step 2. Otherwise, proceed to step 3.

</PRE><P><LI>If the host name will be used in lieu of the IP address of the target
   MTA, ping the host name. Note: DNS will support host name resolution or
   a 'hosts' file may be used. The hosts file for Windows NT Servers is
   located in the 'winntdir'\system32\drivers\etc directory. The format is
   IP address, a tab, and then the host name. Did the host name return an
   ip address?
   No  - There is a problem with name resolution.
   Yes - Proceed to step 3.

<P><LI>Configure the Microsoft Exchange MTA to support a 2k TPDU. Start the
   Windows NT Registry Editor, change to:
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
<PRE>                     \MSExchangeMTA\Parameters

   enter a new value of Support 2K TPDU, set the type to DWORD, and the
   value to 0x1 (1 HEX).

</PRE><P><LI>Have the administrator configuring a given MTA record the following
   information for the MTA that they want to connect to:
<P>
   Remote Host name: This entry is is case sensitive and may not exceed 32
<PRE>                     characters in length. It is used to specifiy the
                     Remote MTA name on the General tab of the Microsoft
                     Exchange X.400 connector.

   Remote MTA password: This entry is case sensitive and may not exceed a
                        length of 64 characters. It is used to specifiy the
                        Remote MTA password on the General tab of the
                        Microsoft Exchange X.400 connector.

   T selector: This value may not exceed 32 Text characters (64 HEX
               characters). This value is critical and must be an exact
               match with the corresponding value specified in the
               configuration for the MTA on the other host. This value will
               be used for the T selector specified on the Stack tab of the
               Microsoft Exchange X.400 connector. If the remote admin
               wants to specify a S selector and/or a P Selector, this
               should be done after successful messaging has been
               established. The Selector supported in the X.400 link
               options depends on the Mode of the MTA. 1988 mode supports
               T, S and P selector. 1984 modes support a T selector only.

</PRE><P><LI>Use the Overide tab to specify the local MTA and Password. The Microsoft
   Exchange MTA will use the name of the Windows NT Server on which
   Microsoft Exchange Server is installed for the MTA name. If no incoming
   password is desired, using the Override tab is unnecessary. Using a
   password is redundant because the T selector provides adequate security.

<P><LI>The administrator of the foreign MTA will provide the X.400 address
   associated with the foreign MTA or will request that you specify a
<PRE>   'wildcard' for the Country code in the address space configured on the
   Adress tab of the Microsoft Exchange X.400 connector. Using a 'wildcard'
   character, the '*', in the address space will result in a match for all
   X.400 recipients not local to the Microsoft Exchange Server.

</PRE><P><LI>The information on the Advanced tab of the Microsoft Exchange X.400
   connector should be configured to match the mode of the foreign MTA. The
   X.400 link option for allow MS Exchange Content should always be
   disabled when connecting to a foreign MTA (Help on the Advanced tab).
   The typical foreign MTA will require that Two Way Alternate be disabled.
   Allow BP-15 (in addition to BP-14) is available when sending to a 1984
   X.410 or a 1988 mode foreign MTA.

<P><LI>Make a custom recipient on both hosts or send to a user on the foreign
   host using a 1-off address in the To: line. The following is an example
   of a 1-off address:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [x400:c=us;a=attmail;p=organization;o=locale;s=lastname;g=firstname]
</PRE>
<P><LI>If the above test fails in either direction, highlight the Server object
   in the Microsoft Exchange Admininistrator. With the Server object
   highlighted, select the File menu and the Properties option. Select the
   Diagnostics Logging tab and increase the MSExchangeMTA X.400
   Interoperablility and APDU logging to Maxium. This will result in
   logging to the Bf0.log, Ev0.log and Ap0.log in the MTADATA directory.

<P><LI>Repeat the send mail testing and contact Microsoft Technical Support.
