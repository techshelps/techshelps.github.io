The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook Windows 95 client, version 8.03
<LI>Microsoft Outlook Windows NT client, version 8.03
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you view the properties of a Microsoft Exchange Server folder, the
Agents tab that is used to configure Server Scripting may be missing. This
article explains some of the possible reasons why this tab may not appear.
<P>
The Exchange Server Scripting Agent extension is included with Microsoft
Outlook 97, version 8.03. It allows you to create server-side scripts that
can be run on Microsoft Exchange Server. The extension adds an Agents tab
which is visible on the Properties dialog box of a private or public
folder.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the Agents tab does not appear for any reason, check the following
items:

<OL><P><LI>Is the correct version of Microsoft Outlook installed?
<P>
   You must have Microsoft Outlook, version 8.03.4629 or later, installed.

<P><LI>Is the Exchange Scripting Agent installed?
<P>
   By default, the Scripting Agent extension is installed during a Typical
   or Custom installation of Microsoft Outlook. In some cases, the
   extension may not be installed properly. Another possibility is that
   you may have performed a Custom installation or run Setup in
   Maintenance mode and removed the Exchange Scripting Agent option.
<P>
   To verify that the extension is installed correctly:
<P>
   a. On the On the Tools menu, click Options from and then click the
<P><PRE>      General tab.
</PRE><P>
   b. Click the Add-In Manager button. The Server Scripting extension
<P><PRE>      should be listed and selected in the Add-Ins dialog box.
</PRE><P>
</OL>c. If it is not listed, run Setup and use the Add/Remove option to install
<PRE>   the Exchange Scripting Agent extension. You may also want to verify
   that the following files are installed on the workstation:

   File Name      Version      Size (bytes)
   ------------   ----------   ------------
   ESCONF.DLL     5.5.1960.0   94,480
   SCRPTXTN.DLL   5.5.1960.0   54,032

</PRE><P><LI>Are permissions set correctly on the Microsoft Exchange server?
<P>
   In order to install and administer event scripts, the user must be
   granted at least Author permissions on the EventConfig_&lt;servername&gt;
   object in the Exchange Server directory. To configure the appropriate
   permissions:
<P>
   a. In the Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Administrator, select the
<P><PRE>      EventConfig_&lt;servername&gt; object from the Folders\System
      Folders\Events Root container.
</PRE><P>
   b. On the File menu, click Properties. On the General tab, click Client
<P><PRE>      Permissions.
</PRE><P>
   c. In the Client Permissions dialog box, select the Add button.
<P>
   d. Select one or more users who will be managing scripts on the server
<P><PRE>      and grant them a role of at least Author. Press OK twice.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Is the correct server specified as the Public Folder Server?
<P>
   A setting for the Private Information Store on the Microsoft Exchange
   Server computer specifies which server in the Exchange organization will
<P><PRE>    be responsible for creating and managing public folders. In order for
</PRE>   the Agents tab to appear on the client side, the server referenced by
   this setting must be running Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 or
   later. To verify this setting:
<P>
   a. In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, select the
<P><PRE>      Private Information Store container for the Microsoft Exchange Server
      5.5 that contains the EventConfig_&lt;server&gt; object.
</PRE><P>
   b. On the File menu, click Properties.
<P>
   c. On the General tab, select the Public Folder Server dropdown and
<P><PRE>      select a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 (or later) computer. This
     option tells Exchange Server where to obtain the Public Folder
     hierarchy, in which the EventConfig_&lt;servername&gt; folder is listed.
     Click OK.
</PRE><P>
   e. Restart the Microsoft Outlook client.
<P>
   NOTE: It may also be necessary to cycle the Exchange Server services in
   order to force this change to take effect immediately.
<P>
</OL>The Agents tab should now appear in the Microsoft Outlook client.
