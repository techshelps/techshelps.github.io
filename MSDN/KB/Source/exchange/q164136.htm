<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When sending a message from an MS Mail 3.x client with a Read Receipt (RR)
request, the RR reply may come back to the client without the To and
Subject fields.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are three instances in which this will happen.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server is connecting to another Exchange organization or
third party messaging platform via X.400 connectors.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Server is connecting to the same Exchange
organization, however, the X.400 site addressing between the sites is
different at the ADMD and/or PRMD level. An example of this would be:
<P>
<PRE>   Site A
      C=US;A=TELCO1;P=SiteA

   Site B
      C=US;A=TELCO2;P=SiteB

</PRE>The Read Receipt sent by the MS Mail client is in a MAPI format. This MAPI
request is converted by Microsoft Exchange Server to an X400 Read Receipt
request that does not support some of the MAPI fields for the To and
Subject lines.
<P>
This situation is by design because the MS Mail client was not designed
with X.400 in mind.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 3</h3>
 
<P>
If the Microsoft Exchange Server computers are connected with X.400
connectors using the Connected Sites tab, and directory replication is
enabled, there is a chance that the MAPI information will be stripped from
the message during a conversion. The Microsoft Exchange Server computers
should pass the information along, however, if more than two hops are
required, an X400 conversion may take place.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 4.0 and 5.0 of
Microsoft Exchange. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Setting up Site Connectors in place of the X.400 connectors will fix this
problem and is recommended if the existing topology warrants such a change.
