The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Symptoms of this problem occur in both the Exchange Administrator program
and in Exchange e-mail clients as follows:
<P>
In the Exchange Administrator program when you view one of the Address Book
View containers, the object count in the status line may be incorrect. This
can occur when recipients are added or deleted from the view, either by
changing attributes or importing users.
<P>
In the Exchange Client the problem is an inactive scrollbar when the
scrollbar should be activated. This affects the list of recipients in the
view container.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange directory service does not update the object count
when expected.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem in the Exchange Administrator program, perform
the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the Address Book View that holds the container with the problem.

<P><LI>From the File menu select Properties.

<P><LI>Select the Advanced tab.

<P><LI>Deselect the checkbox for "Show this view in the client address book."

<P><LI>Click the OK button.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 1 through 5, except in Step 4 reselect the "Show this view
   in the client address book" checkbox.
<P>
</OL>To work around this problem in the Exchange Client, use cursor keys to
scroll though all names in the view.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
