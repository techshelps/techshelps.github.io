The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article details the steps for configuration of the Microsoft Schedule+
Free/Busy Connector included with Microsoft Exchange Server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two requirements that must be completed and verified prior to
configuring the Microsoft Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector. The first is that
the Microsoft Mail Connector must be configured correctly and verification
of mail receipt on Microsoft Mail Postoffices should be performed. The
second is that Directory Synchronization must be configured and functional
between all Microsoft Mail Postoffices that will participate in the
Free/Busy exchange of information and the Global Address list on the
Microsoft Exchange Server must contain all ADMINSCH accounts from the
Microsoft Mail Postoffices.
<P>
During the installation of the Microsoft Exchange Server, you must choose
to install the Microsoft Mail Connector in order to have the Microsoft
Schedule+ Free/Busy Gateway also be installed. If you did not install the
Microsoft Mail Connector on a Microsoft Exchange Server that will handle
the Microsoft Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector, run Setup.exe in maintenance
mode and choose this option.
<P>
The installation routine will create an account on the server the Free/Busy
Gateway is installed on with a friendly name of Microsoft Schedule+ Free
Busy Connector and an alias of AdminSch. This account is located in the
Recipients container. In addition to the above, a Microsoft Exchange
Service is added to the Microsoft Exchange Server called MS Schedule+
Free/Busy Connector. By default, this service is set to manual. Once
configured, you should change this to start automatically using the Control
Panel's Services applet.
<P>
In the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, create a Distribution List
consisting of all your Microsoft Mail or PROFS ADMINSCH accounts. The
Distribution List name can be any name. This list will be used when
configuring the Microsoft Schedule+ Free Busy Connector recipient.
<P>
In order to monitor the activity on the gateway ( in other words, receive
any error messages), you can either create a new Microsoft Exchange Mail
account or use an existing account. This account is used in the
configuration of the Microsoft Schedule+ Free Busy Connector recipient.
<P>
In the Administrator program, open the property page for the Microsoft
Schedule+ Free Busy Connector mailbox and perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the change button associated with the Administrator's mailbox and
   choose either the account created to receive the messages from the
   gateway or another account of your choice. Click OK to add this user to
   the field.

<P><LI>Click the Change button associated with the Microsoft Schedule+
   Distribution List and choose the Distribution list created above.
<P>
</OL>Adminsch.exe must be run so that the Microsoft Exchange Server Connector PO
can be added to the list of Postoffices. It is suggested that the Update
Frequency be set to the same as your settings in Adminsch.exe. It is NOT
suggested that you set this value to less than 15 minutes because this can
create additional traffic on your network. In addition, the shortest time
frame for the Schedule Distribution processing on Microsoft Mail is 15
minutes.
<P>
Now start the MS Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector service from the Control
Panel, (you probably want to make this an automatically starting service as
well).
<P>
Ensure that the Microsoft Mail side is running Schdist.exe. Microsoft
Exchange user's Free/Busy information will now be sent to all Microsoft
Mail AdminSch accounts included on the Distribution List, and the Microsoft
Exchange AdminSch account will receive Free/Busy updates from Microsoft
Mail.
<P>
For more information on configuring Microsoft Mail with Schdist.exe and
Adminsch.exe see <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q141755.htm">Q141755</A></B>.
