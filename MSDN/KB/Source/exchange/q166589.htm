The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Although there is a path to deliver a message between two Microsoft Mail
postoffices by using two Microsoft Mail Connectors, you may not be able to
send a message with attachments. This problem only occurs on versions of
Microsoft Exchange Server which are enabled for double-byte character set
(DBCS), such as Japanese.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the following environment, User-A can send a message to User-B. However,
when User-A sends a message with attachments to User-B, User-A will
occasionally receive a non-delivery report (NDR) from the postmaster of SRV-
B's Microsoft Mail Connector interchange (MSMI).
<P>

Microsoft Mail Connector's property page using the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program, the following event will appear in the receiving
Microsoft Exchange Server's (SRV-B) Windows NT Event Viewer Application

</PRE>User-A will receive an NDR from the postmaster. This NDR only includes the
title of the original message and the reason of NDR:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Mail Connector fails in analysis the contents.
