The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Exchange Server Connector for Lotus cc:Mail, the
following error message may appear in the event log:
<P>
<PRE>   STOP
   Event ID:70
   Source:MSExchangeCCMC
   Type:Error
   Category:General

   Description:
   Lotus cc:Mail EXPORT to file msgxxxx.ccm returned result code 3. The
   Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail has not been configured
   correctly or the Post Office it is configured to connect to is not
   accessible at this time.

</PRE>In this example, in the file ID, "xxxx" stands for a sequentially generated
hexadecimal ID number.
<P>
The generation of this message may also be a reason why mail is not flowing
from cc:Mail to Exchange Server, and may keep the directory synchronization
(dirsync) process from completing.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is a generic error message from the cc:Mail Export program. This error
message is generated by the cc:Mail Export program and the connector is
only displaying it in the Event log. There are several reason why this
error message may be generated:

<UL><LI>The Postoffice tab on the cc:Mail connector has invalid information.

<LI>The Exchange service account does not have access to the cc:Mail
   postoffice.

<LI>The cc:Mail postoffice is fragmented and/or damaged.

<LI>Exchange Server has been installed to a directory path that has a space
   in it.
<P>
</UL>For additional information on this issue, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCHANGE/Q164695.htm">Q164695</A></B>
   TITLE     : XFOR: CCMC Stops Responding

</PRE><LI>Dirsync has not run and successfully completed against this cc:Mail
   postoffice.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: The error occurs every time the service is started until dirsync
successfully completes.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Ensure that the cc:Mail connector Postoffice tab is correctly
   configured. Refer to the Exchange 5.0 "What's New Guide" to for more
   information.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Also ensure that the correct cc:Mail Postoffice password is being
used.

<UL><LI>If the cc:Mail Postoffice is on a Windows NT Server, follow normal
   access right troubleshooting procedures to correct the problem. If the
   cc:Mail Postoffice is on a NetWare server, ensure that Gateway Services
   for NetWare (GSNW) is configured correctly. There are several resources
   available to you to do this:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - See Section 2.6.6. in the Readme.wri document that ships with the
      Exchange Server 5.0. Readme.wri is located at the root of the
      Exchange Server CD.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Refer to the Windows NT online documentation.
</PRE>
<LI>Have the cc:Mail Administrator perform routine maintenance against
   the postoffice.
<P>
   The ccMail Administrator can run the following utilities to fix
   fragmentation and corruption in the ccMail Postoffice: Analyze,
   Chkstat and Reclaim. The administrator should run the Analyze utility
   after every time the Chkstat and Reclaim utilities have been run to
   ensure that all corruption has been fixed.

<LI>Ignore this error message until the first dirsync cycle with the cc:Mail
   postoffice has completed. This error message appears because the Export
   utility is trying to Export information from a postoffice definition
   that does not yet exist.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For more information on the cc:Mail utilities, Analyze, Chkstat and
Reclaim, refer to the cc:Mail documentation or contact Lotus technical
support.
