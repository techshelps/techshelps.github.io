SUMMARY
 
<P>
This article contains some of the frequently asked questions for the
Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector.

<PRE>1. Q. I want to have a different SMTP address. For inside my organization,
      I want to use "user@host", and for outside my organization, I want to
      use "user@company.com". How can I set this up?

   A. You can change this in the Configuration object, Site Addressing
      object, Site Addressing tab. Note that the Exchange recipient has to
      have an additional SMTP-style address created in their e-mail
      addresses tab. If every Exchange recipient wants two different SMTP
      addresses, use DIRECTORY IMPORT, with the attribute Secondary
      -Proxy-Addresses.

2. Q. When I send mail to the Internet, sometimes the recipient has garbage
      at the end of the file, and it says it is the Winmail.dat file at the
      beginning. How can I get rid of this?

   A. The Winmail.dat file is created and used by Exchange and MS Mail to
      hold RTF, attachments, and positioning information of text in the
      message. If the recipient's mail host does not know what to do with
      the Winmail.dat file, you can prevent it from being sent out the
      Internet Mail Connector (IMC) in three different ways:

      1. Configure the IMC using the Internet Mail tab, Interoperability
         Button, and set "Send Microsoft Exchange rich text formatting" to
         Never. This will disable it for all IMC Messages.

      2. If the recipient is a custom recipient in Exchange, make sure he
         does not have "Allow rich text in messages" checked on the
         Advanced tab.

      3. If the recipient is in a personal address book (PAB), ensure that
         the "Always send to this recipient in Microsoft Exchange rich-text
         format" option is not checked. This option is on the SMTP-General
         tab.

3. Q. Can I use DHCP to configure the IMC host?

   A. This is not recommended. The IP address of the IMC host needs to be
      entered in a DNS or host table in order for other SMTP hosts to send
      mail to the IMC. If the IP address changes periodically, these
      records will have to be changed also. It is best to have a static IP
      address for the IMC. If DHCP must be used, you should set up a
      permanent lease for the IMC host.

4. Q. How do I get the IMC to dial-up my Internet provider using async and
      retrieve mail?

   A. The IMC itself cannot dial up and send or receive mail. The IMC
      expects to have the ability to connect to other SMTP hosts already
      available. However, there is a way to accomplish the same thing using
      the AT command in Microsoft Windows NT Server. The administrator will
      make arrangements with the Internet Provider to hold mail delivery
      until certain predefined times.

      At these predefined times, the IMC service can be started with the AT
      command. Because the IMC can accept multiple simultaneous
      connections, it can send and receive mail from the Internet Provider
      at the same time.

5. Q. I want to use the IMC and Exchange to handle mail between my &lt;your
      favorite SMTP&gt; mail users and &lt;other next favorite SMTP&gt; mail users.
      How do I do this?

   A. Exchange and the IMC must know in the Directory for whom it is
      delivering mail. For this to work, all users on each SMTP system MUST
      be added as custom recipients into Exchange.

6. Q. I keep getting an error when I send mail that says: "No route to
      intended recipient."  What does this mean?

   A. It means that the Address Space for the IMC is not set up correctly.
      If you want all SMTP mail to go to this IMC, use a type of "SMTP",
      address of "*" and cost of 1.

7. Q. The IMC is using DNS and I have a Hosts File In the Event of the DNS
      Being Down. When the DNS server is down all the mail stays in the
      queue. The Hosts File is never used.

   A. This is by design. The IMC does not use the Hosts File if the DNS is
      down; this will protect against outdated addresses in the Hosts File
      being used to deliver the mail to a wrong adress. To fix the problem
      configure the IMC to send to a specific host address until the DNS is
      up, then change it back to DNS.
