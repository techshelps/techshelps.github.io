The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Attachment names in messages received from Internet users are different
from those from when the message was sent. For example, a message sent with
an attachment named FILENAME.NEW, might be received with the attachment
renamed to FILENAME.TXT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This happens with messages sent using MIME encoding. The MIME header of
each message received contains a field called "Content-Type". This field
contains a value that indicates the type of the document. For example, this
field could have a value of "text/plain" indicating that the attachment
contains plain text.
<P>
RFC 1521 defines the following content types:
<P>
<PRE>   Text
   Multipart
   Message
   Application
   Image
   Video
   Audio

</PRE>New types and subtypes are defined by registering them with the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) uses the value of the
Content-Type field to determine what the extension of the file name of the
attachment should be. It determines the extension of the name based on the
MIME Types mapping that is defined using the Microsoft Exchange
administrator program.
<P>
You can define or modify the Content-Type Mappings in the MIME Types page
of the Internet Mail Connector Properties dialog box in the Microsoft 
Exchange Administrator program. For Microsoft Exchange version 5.0, to 
view the MIME Types tab, go to the Protocols Object (Site or Server) and 
select File Properties, MIME Types will be the last Tab.
<P>
If the attachment name received has an extension and this extension is not
what the Content Type mapping specifies, the IMC replaces the original
extension with the new extension. If the attachment name received has no
extension, the IMC adds an extension based on the content type header.
<P>
The benefit of having the IMC replace filename extensions is that is allows
all attachments of a particular MIME Type to have the same extension when
they are received by the client. For example, Microsoft Word documents
(Content-Type: application/msword) always have an extension of .DOC
regardless of what the extension was when the message was sent. This makes
it easier for the client to open the attachment.
<P>
If you prefer that the IMC does not change the extensions of attachments of
a particular content type, the entry in the IMC Content-Type Mapping for
that content type should be removed. In this case, if the IMC does not find
a mapping for a particular Content Type, it uses the filename received
without modifying it.
