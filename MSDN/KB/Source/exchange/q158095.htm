The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A white paper on ShivaRemote is located on Microsoft TechNet and can also
be found on the following World Wide Web location:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ExchangeSupport/">http://www.microsoft.com/ExchangeSupport/</A></B>

</PRE>ShivaRemote 3.59 can be used with the Microsoft Exchange client to allow
users to remotely access a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server
(either through a computer running Windows NT Server with RAS or Shiva
LanRover). This article shows you how to install and configure the
ShivaRemote software that ships with Microsoft Exchange to work over LanMan
NetBEUI version 2.2c.
<P>
(For information about setting up Shiva for use over other protocols, see
the Reference section below).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To configure your computer so that you can use ShivaRemote:

<OL><P><LI>Install MS-DOS on your computer.

<P><LI>Install Microsoft LAN Manager 2.2 Full Redirector (LanMan software is
   located on the Windows NT 3.51 Server compact disc in the
   Clients\Lanman\disks directory).

<P><LI>Install Microsoft Windows 3.1.

<P><LI>Install Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client.

<P><LI>Run the ShivaRemote Setup program from the Microsoft Exchange program
   group.

<P><LI>When ShivaRemote Setup is complete, restart your computer so that the
   configuration changes you made take effect.

<P><LI>After your computer restarts, make the following changes to Config.sys
<P><PRE>    and Protocol.ini:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    Config.sys:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>       DEVICE=C:\SHIVA\DIALNDIS.EXE    &lt;- Add this line.

    Protocol.ini:

    NOTE: The name of the NETBEUI section below may vary.  The "T1" entry
    specifies the main NETBEUI time-out value; 8000 specifies 8 seconds.

       [NETBEUI]
       ; BINDINGS = "UBNEITP_NIF"      &lt;- Make this line a comment.
       BINDINGS=SDIALIN$               &lt;- Add this line.
       T1=8000                         &lt;- Add this line.
       [SDIALIN$]                      &lt;- Add this line.
       DriverName=SDIALIN$             &lt;- Add this line.

</PRE><P><LI>Your computer should be configured for ShivaRemote dial-in.  Restart
   your computer again, and watch for error messages as the computer
   starts.

<P><LI>You must log on to the network before starting the Microsoft Exchange
   client. If you are not connected to the network when you log on to the
   network, LAN Manager will display the following message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      You are logged on, but have not been validated by a server.
      Therefore, you may not have permission to use some network
      resources.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK and proceed.
<P>
</OL>You can configure LAN Manager to prompt you to log on to the network when
you start Windows.
<P>
To configure LAN Manager, use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>Configure LAN Manager using the Setup program, as follows:
<P>
   1. Run the LAN Manager Setup program (Setup.exe) in your LAN Manager
<P><PRE>      directory (C:\Lanman.dos).
</PRE><P>
   2. On the Configuration menu, click Workstation Settings.
<P>
   3. In the Workstation Settings dialog box, click OK.
<P>
   4. In the Support For Windows Environment dialog box, click Yes and
<P><PRE>      click OK.
</PRE><P>
   5. In the Windows Directory dialog box, type the directory where Windows
<P><PRE>      is installed (by default C:\Windows) and click OK.
</PRE><P>
   6. In the Memory Management dialog box, choose your memory management
<P><PRE>      settings and click OK.
</PRE><P>
   7. On the LAN Manager menu, click Exit Setup.
<P>
   8. Restart your computer.
<P>
</UL>-OR-

<UL><LI>Add the following commands to your Autoexec.bat file (or type the
   commands at the MS-DOS prompt):
<P>
<P><PRE>      net start workstation
      load networking_protocols
      net logon username
</PRE><P>
   Once you have the above setup, restart and ensure you receive no error
   messages when booting with the newly configured Autoexec.bat and
   Config.sys.
<P>
</UL>To install the client:

<OL><P><LI>Install the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client software (run Setup
   from the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client compact disc or from a
   sharepoint). Select Custom install and verify that Shiva is selected.
   (Setup will create a "ShivaRemote setup" icon in the Microsoft Exchange
   Program group).

<P><LI>If possible, verify a valid Exchange mailbox/account exists while
   connected to the LAN.  (Start the Microsoft Exchange client, create a
   profile and make sure you can log on to your mailbox and send a piece of
   mail to yourself).
<P>
</OL>To install ShivaRemote:

<OL><P><LI>Run "ShivaRemote setup" from the Microsoft Exchange Program group.

<P><LI>Click OK to Install ShivaRemote.

<P><LI>Select the port and your specific modem manufacturer/model.

<P><LI>Specify a Description, Dial-in-Name (NT account that has been granted
   dial-in access on the server), Password (Password for the NT Account you
   are dialing in on), and Phone number.
<P>
</OL>To connect to the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server:

<OL><P><LI>Dial the computer running  RAS. (Microsoft Exchange is supported dialing
   into either a computer running Windows NT Server with RAS or a Shiva
   LanRover.)

<P><LI>Once connected, minimize ShivaRemote Connect

<P><LI>Start the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client (online, as a test).
   Type the User Name (Exchange Mailbox Name), the Password (Windows NT
   Domain Password), and the Domain (Windows NT Domain Name that your
   account is in) and verify you can be properly logged on.
<P>
   If the above step allows you to properly send/receive mail, Shiva and
   Microsoft Exchange are configured correctly.
<P>
</OL>The Microsoft Exchange client remote capabilities can now be configured
(remote mail or off-line folders).
<P>
To setup the Microsoft Exchange client to automatically dial while working
offline :

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel/Mail-Fax, select the properties for Exchange Server
   in the profile and on the "dial up networking" tab

<P><LI>Select the Shiva connection name that was tested in step 1  under "dial
   using the following connection."

<P><LI>Type the user name, password, and domain name in the dialog box.
<P>
</OL>You can start the Microsoft Exchange client offline and select either the
"remote mail/connect" or "sync this folder" check box. Shiva will dial and
transmit necessary information (depending on whether off-line folders [.ost
files] or .pst files are being used).
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCE</h2>
 
<P>
Updated modem scripts for use with ShivaRemote can be found on Shiva's
web page at www.shiva.com under "support"/modem scripts.
<P>
Additional configuration information may also be found in the config.hlp
file installed during installation of the ShivaRemote software.
