The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are currently four products available from Microsoft that use the
SMTP protocol to access Internet mail. This article outlines how these
products differ and what support options are available to customers.
<P>
The four products are:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector
<LI>Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP Version 3.0
<LI>Windows Messaging (Formally Microsoft Internet Mail Service for
   Windows 95 Exchange)
<LI>Microsoft Internet Mail 1.0
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The four different Internet mail products enable users to access SMTP mail
and fit into two basic types of products. The first type of product are
Enterprise connectors which enable workgroups or entire operations to
access Internet mail without direct connectivity to the Internet and
connectors that attach to enterprise e-mail systems and retrieve SMTP mail
for an entire domain. The second type of Internet mail product enables a
user to directly send Internet mail using the SMTP protocol and to retrieve
e-mail using the POP3 protocol. POP3 is Post Office Protocol version 3 and
is used for clients that are not permanently connected to the Internet and
are not part of an enterprise messaging system.
<P>
<P><h2>Enterprise Connectors</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) Part #: 67743.
<P>
Included with Microsoft Exchange Server Enterprise Edition. Part #:67742
Protocol Support: SMTP, MIME, UUENCODE, DNS
Supported by: Microsoft Information Exchange Support
<P>
The Internet Mail Connector (IMC) is the Internet mail component for
Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft Exchange is a world class enterprise
messaging system. The IMC is a robust connector that can directly connect
to the Internet to retrieve and send SMTP mail. The IMC can also use
another SMTP host on the Internet to deliver and receive Internet mail.
This allows the intermediate SMTP server to act as a proxy on behalf of the
IMC. This robust connector can facilitate simultaneous outgoing and
incoming SMTP mail transfers and can be configured to support MIME and
UUENCODE file attachments and supports rich text formatting.
<P>
This product fully integrates with Microsoft Exchange Server as a Windows
NT service. This gives the messaging service administrator the ability to
configure SMTP mail options for the entire enterprise.
<P>
MICROSOFT MAIL GATEWAY TO SMTP VERSION 3.0 Part #: 56770.
<P>
Protocol Support: SMTP, UUENCODE
Supported by: Microsoft Information Exchange Support
<P>
The Microsoft Mail Gateway is the Internet mail component for Microsoft
Mail. Microsoft Mail is the legacy shared file system (SFS) enterprise
messaging system. The gateway enables users of Microsoft Mail to send and
receive SMTP mail. The gateway must use another SMTP host (smarthost) on
the Internet to deliver Internet mail. The SMTP gateway is an MS-DOS
program that runs on a dedicated PC. It can handle one connection at a
time. Because of this limitation, it is recommended that the SMTP smarthost
also receive mail on behalf of the gateway by implementing an MX record on
the smarthost DNS server. This directs other SMTP hosts on the Internet to
deliver mail bound for the gateway to the smarthost for more robust
performance.
<P>
This product does not support the MIME protocol for file attachments and
does not implement DNS.
<P>
<P><h2>POP3 CLIENTS</h2>
 
<P>
WINDOWS MESSAGING
(Formally Microsoft Internet Mail Service for Windows 95 Exchange)
<P>
Included with Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95, Microsoft Internet Explorer,
and on the Microsoft World Wide Web server
(<B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software)">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software).</A></B>
Protocol Support: SMTP, POP3, MIME, UUENCODE, DNS
Supported by: Microsoft Answer Point Desktop Support
<P>
Windows Messaging is the electronic mail client that is included with
Windows 95. The client was originally called Microsoft Exchange for Windows
95 but this has caused confusion with the Microsoft Exchange Server
products.
<P>
Windows Messaging is a client that can be extended with services that
integrate with the product. Multiple services can be added to allow
connectivity to different mail systems, including the Internet. The service
for SMTP mail is Microsoft Internet Mail Service for Windows 95. Once
installed, the client must directly connect to the Internet and connect to
a POP3 server to retrieve mail.
<P>
Windows Messaging must have access to an SMTP server to send mail and a
POP3 server to retrieve mail. The POP3 service is usually provided and
supported by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) that also provides dial-up
Internet access.
<P>
MICROSOFT INTERNET MAIL 1.0 *BETA PRODUCT*
<P>
Available on the Microsoft World Wide Web server
(<B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/imn/)">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/imn/).</A></B>

</PRE>Microsoft Internet Mail is the newest electronic mail client for Windows NT
4.0 and Windows 95. This client only supports SMTP/POP3 and does not work
with other mail systems. It cannot be extended by adding services like the
Windows Messaging client. This client is easy to set up, has a preview
pane, and has an address book. This client is primarily designed to be
quick and easy to use without having as many features as the Windows
Messaging client.
<P>
Microsoft Internet Mail must have access to an SMTP server to send mail and
a POP3 server to retrieve mail. The POP3 service is usually provided and
supported by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) that also provides dial-up
Internet access.
<P>
THIS PRODUCT IS CURRENTLY IN BETA. Support is limited to the NNTP
newsgroups listed above.
