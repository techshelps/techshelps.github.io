<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Domain Name System (DNS) entries for Mail Exchanger (MX) records should
point to canonicalized host names. MX records should address fully-
qualified principal names or domain literals. Pointing an MX record to an
alias (CNAME) can cause misrouted inbound mail.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
DNS is used to identify computers on the Internet. The Internet Mail
Connector (IMC) uses DNS to resolve IP addresses when sending mail. A
sending SMTP server also uses DNS to determine which host on the
destination network is appropriate to receive mail. To determine mail
hosts, the sending server checks for an MX record. Next, the sending server
resolves the MX record to an IP address by checking for an address record
(A record). If an A record is found, the address is fully canonicalized and
mail can be delivered.
<P>
However, if an alias record (CNAME) is used for the hostname listed in the
MX record, the sending host might re-write the envelope and redirect the
RCPT command to the alias hostname and not the original recipient. This
might cause the destination SMTP host to reject the message.
<P>
Example:
<P>
<PRE>company.com.      MX 10       mail.company.com.
mail.company.com.    IN CNAME    server.company.com.

</PRE>When you address mail to "admin@company.com" with the above configuration,
the sending host might detect the fact that the "mail.company.com" is an
alias and rewrite the RCPT-TO command to "server.company.com". Thus, the
mail envelope written during SMTP mail transmission might be changed to
"admin@server.company.com". If the mail system isn't configured to accept
mail for "server.company.com" the message will be returned as
undeliverable. This problem can be difficult to detect since the body of
the message with the TO: line is left unchanged.
<P>
Desired Configuration:
<P>
<PRE>company.com.      MX 10       mail.company.com.
mail.company.com.    IN A     127.127.127.127

</PRE>In the above example, the MX record resolves directly to an IP address.
This causes the sending host to realize that the resolved address is
canonical and the final destination. Alias records (CNAME) aren't needed
because the connection can be redirected to the desired CNAME's IP address
directly instead of using an alias record.
<P>
RFC 1123 explicitly states that SMTP mail should be addressed to canonical
name hosts. To be canonical, the DNS entry must be an A record or an MX
record. CNAME records are not canonical and should not be mixed with MX
records.
<P>
Note that most SMTP servers do not rewrite the message envelope when
resolving through aliases. Usually this configuration problem can be
detected if there are complaints that a user receives the majority of their
SMTP mail but mail from a particular host is rejected even though the
addressing is the same.
