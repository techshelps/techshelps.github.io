The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.1 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Windows client Setup program will fail when you run
it with the /Q1 switch and there is not enough disk space on the
destination drive.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Many customers are interested in using Microsoft Systems Management Server
(SMS) to install the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows on their
workstations. To help them with this, Microsoft provides a .PDF file for
SMS installation on the Microsoft Exchange Client CD (in the SMS\ENG
directory). There is a .PDF file for each client platform and these files
list the /Q1 switch as the appropriate switch to use for typical quiet
mode, or unattended, installation.
<P>
The SMS installation might seem to fail when run with the /Q1 switch. You
will start the installation process by running Setup /Q1, the Setup blue
screen will appear, and then Setup will exit without error, leaving you at
the install point. At this point, you might think that the /Q1 switch is
invalid or there is a problem with the .PDF file. However, what is
happening is that after the Microsoft Exchange Setup screen appears, it
checks for adequate disk space on the workstation and if it does not find
enough space on the drive, it will quit. Because it was running in quiet
mode, no message will be displayed. If you run without the /Q1, you will
receive a message stating that there is not enough disk space.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The way to resolve this problem is to be sure there is enough free disk
space on the workstation before attempting to install the Microsoft
Exchange client in quiet mode.
