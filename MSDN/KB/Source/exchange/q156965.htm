The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The time displayed as the Sent time for a Microsoft Exchange message is
incorrect by one or more hours. More specifically, the date/time stamp
shown in the SMTP Header information of a message is not the same time as
that shown in the Sent field in the message.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the originator transmits a message, Microsoft Exchange will attach the
date, time, and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) offset. These values reflect the
time that the message left the originator’s Outbox. However, when a
Microsoft Exchange client displays the message in the recipient's mailbox,
it converts the time that the message was sent to the equivalent time in
the recipient's time zone. For example, if I am located in Seattle and send
a message to you at 1:00 PM (13:00) Pacific Daylight Time and you receive
the message in Charlotte within 15 seconds, the time showing in the Sent
field of the message will be 4:00:15 PM (16:00:15). Depending on the time
settings of the respective Microsoft Exchange clients and Microsoft
Exchange Servers involved, the SMTP Header information on the originating
message will show: 13:00:00 (-07:00) or 13:00:00 (PDT) and the time stamp
from the receiving server will show 16:00:15 (-04:00) or 16:00:15 (EDT).
Note that the GMT offset may be expressed as either a numeric value, -
04:00, or an alphabetic label, EDT.
<P>
Microsoft Exchange accomplishes this conversion in a two step process.
First, it converts the time that the message was sent to GMT. Second, it
converts the GMT time of the message to the local time of the recipient. In
the example above, it would first convert the 13:00 PST sent time to 20:00
GMT and then the 20:00 GMT to 16:000 EDT. The 15 second actual transmission
time is also added to the Sent: time to produce the final time displayed on
the message.
<P>
Time zone offsets West of Greenwich are expressed as negative numbers and
time zone offsets East of Greenwich are expressed as positive numbers. The
Microsoft Exchange client does not recognize all alphabetic time zone
labels. In fact, it can only convert ten alphabetic time zone labels to
their numeric equivalents. The recognized time zones are:
<P>
<PRE>   Time Zone Label      Numeric Offset
   ===============      ==============
        GMT                +  0:00
        UT                 +  0:00
        EST                - 05:00
        EDT                - 04:00
        CST                - 06:00
        CDT                - 05:00
        MST                - 07:00
        MDT                - 06:00
        PST                - 08:00
        PDT                - 07:00

</PRE>All other alphabetic time zone labels are ignored. For those time zones,
the result will be that the message time will be off by the exact amount of
the GMT offset for that time zone.
<P>
Why does Microsoft Exchange handle time zone values this way? Because
that's the way RFC 822 defines time zones. According to the RFC, the only
time zones with recognized, or official, time zone labels are the ones
listed above. So Microsoft Exchange is functioning in a way that is
literally compliant with the applicable RFC. To do otherwise would take us
out of compliance.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Ensure that all Microsoft Exchange Servers handling mail express time with
numeric offsets rather than alphabetic labels.
