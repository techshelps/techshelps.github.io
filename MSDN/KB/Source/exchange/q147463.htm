<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Directory synchronization (dirsync) allows Microsoft Exchange Server to
exchange directories with Microsoft Mail for PC and AppleTalk networks and
other systems that support the Microsoft Mail Directory Synchronization
protocol. The process relies on the MS Mail Connector interchange, MS Mail
(PC) MTA, and MS Mail (AppleTalk) MTA, if used, to be functioning. Problems
with directory synchronization can be in planning, messaging between the
systems, or configuration problems in Microsoft Exchange Server, MS Mail
(PC), or MS Mail (AppleTalk).
<P>
Duplicate display names appear for custom recipients and new Microsoft
Exchange mailboxes.

                                  reply when it is delivered. If
                                  delivery fails, treat this as a
                                  routing or connection problem.

Dispatch is not running on the    Check the dispatch logs on the
postoffices.                      postoffices for reported
                                  successes and failures.

The configuration is incorrect.   Check if the MS Mail (PC)

                                  addresses. Microsoft Exchange
                                  Server should show up as the MS

</PRE>Updates for MS Mail (PC) are no longer being received.

<PRE>Reasons                           Actions
=======                           =======

Mail is not getting through.      Check the queues on the
                                  connection and on the
                                  postoffices between the
                                  directory synchronization server
                                  and the requestors.

Dispatch is not running on the    Look at the dispatch logs on the
postoffices.                      postoffices for reported success
                                  and failures.

Configuration has been changed.   Check configuration with both
                                  Administrator programs for
                                  changes. Verify that network and
                                  postoffice names are accurate
                                  and that the requestor password
                                  is correct. Verify that mail and
                                  replies to mail arrive as
                                  expected between Microsoft
                                  Exchange Server and the
                                  postoffice.
