The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" 
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you use the Move Mailbox feature, mailboxes on the new server will
not be able to view new messages with delegate permissions.
<P>
You will notice, however, the message count will always reflect the correct
number of messages in the delegate's Inbox. This specific feature is by
design for View/Searches.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Using the Move Mailbox feature of Microsoft Exchange Server corrupts
certain properties on search folders. This does not cause any corruption in
messages or in the database but does change certain properties on search
folders. A search folder is a View/Sort/Filter of any kind. It does not
contain messages but, instead, contains pointers to messages.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
To work around this problem, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Exchange Administrator program and connect to the server
   affected by this problem.

<P><LI>Set information store maintenance to Always. This can be set from the IS
   Maintenance tab on the Properties page for the affected server.
   NOTE: If IS Maintenance is not set to Always, you will delay the
   deletion of the restrictions on views until normal maintenance is
   scheduled.

<P><LI>From the server's Properties page, select the Diagnostics Logging tab.
   From MSExchangeIS, then Private, set Views to MAXIMUM.

<P><LI>Create the following registry value:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS
      \ParametersPrivate
      Value Name: Reset Views
      Data Type: REG_WORD
      Value: 1
</PRE>
<P><LI>Stop and restart the information store service. This can be done via
   Control Panel/Services.
<P>
</OL>In about 15 minutes or less, the Maintenance Thread will execute, and you
will notice the Reset Views registry value has been set to 0. This tells
Exchange it is time to delete the cached restrictions/views, no matter how
old they are. Normally, IS Maintenance will delete a cached restriction
after 8 days of non-use.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After you perform the above workaround, it is important to note that the
client application may appear slow the first time a user views a mailbox
with delegate permissions. This is normal, because the View/Restriction
must be recreated for the client.
<P>
After the information store service has been running for a while (about one
hour), check the Application Event log for the following event:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 1175
   Source: MSExchangeISPrivate
   Description: Deleted 4458 unused restricted views.

</PRE></OL>After this process has been completed, the registry value (specified in
step 4 above) will be set to 0. Then you should undo the changes made in
steps 2 and 3 above (that is, reset the information store maintenance
schedule and set Diagnostics Logging to NONE).
<P>
At this point, the delegates should be able to see all messages except
Private messages.
