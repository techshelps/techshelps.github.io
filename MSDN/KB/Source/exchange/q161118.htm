<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists steps to help you troubleshoot problems when you 
attempt to connect to the Internet Mail Server from an e-mail client 
using post office protocol version 3 (POP3). These steps are based on 
information in the Request for Comments (RFC) 1725 and RFC 1939 
specifications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Basic Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<P>
If you are unable to connect to the Internet Mail Server from an e-mail 
client using POP3, use the following steps to troubleshoot the problem. 
After performing each step, check to see if the issue has been resolved.

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the e-mail client is POP3-compliant. Many e-mail clients 
   are not POP3-compliant. In particular, many newer e-mail clients 
   support Internet Mail Access Protocol version 4 (IMAP4). Microsoft 
   Exchange Server does not support IMAP4. Microsoft Exchange Server 
   supports POP3 as defined in the RFC 1725, RFC 1734, RFC 1939, and 
   RFC 1953 specifications.

<P><LI>Use the Telnet tool to connect to the Microsoft Exchange Server. To do 
   so, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. On the e-mail client, start Telnet. For the host name, type the 
<P><PRE>      name of the Microsoft Exchange Server computer, and for the port 
      type, type 110. If a "term type" is requested, do not type 
      anything. For example, type the following command to start Telnet:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         telnet &lt;server&gt; 110

      where &lt;server&gt; is the name of the Microsoft Exchange Server 
      computer. If you are running Windows 95, Windows NT Workstation, or 
      Windows NT Server, you can type the above command at a command 
      prompt or in the Run dialog box. If you are running Windows NT 
      Workstation or Windows NT Server version 3.51, you can open the Run 
      dialog box from the File menu or the task list.

      When you type the above command and then press ENTER, a message 
      similar to the following should be displayed:

         +OK Microsoft Exchange POP3 server version 5.0.1457.10 ready

      NOTE: The version number might be different, but it should be 
      5.0.1457.10 or later.

   b. Enable local echo for the current Telnet session. To do so, on the 
      Terminal menu, click Preferences, click the Local Echo check box to 
      select it, and then click OK.

   c. Type the following command, and then press ENTER: 
 
         user &lt;domain&gt;\&lt;username&gt;\&lt;mailbox&gt;

      where &lt;domain&gt; is the name of the domain in which the user's 
      account is located, &lt;username&gt; is the user name, and &lt;mailbox&gt; is 
      the user's mailbox. Note that the &lt;mailbox&gt; portion of the above 
      command is only necessary if it is different from the &lt;username&gt; 
      portion. When you press ENTER, "+OK" (without quotation marks) 
      should be displayed.

   d. Type the following command, and then press ENTER:

         pass &lt;password&gt;

      where &lt;password&gt; is the user's password. When you press ENTER, the 
      following message should be displayed:

         +OK User successfully logged on

   e. To determine if the user has new messages, type "stat" (without 
      quotation marks), and then press ENTER. After you press ENTER, the 
      following message should be displayed:

         +OK &lt;x&gt; &lt;yyyy&gt;

      where &lt;x&gt; is the number of new messages and &lt;yyyy&gt; is the total 
      size of the messages in bytes. This is known as a "drop listing."

   f. To end the Telnet session, type "quit" (without quotation marks), 
      and then press ENTER. When you press ENTER, a message similar to 
      the following should be displayed:

         +OK Microsoft Exchange POP3 server version 5.0.1457.10 
         signing off

</PRE></OL>NOTE: The above POP3 commands can only be used to troubleshoot problems 
when you attempt to receive messages. A POP3 client uses Simple Mail 
Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send messages. For information about how 
troubleshoot problems when you attempt to send messages, please see the 
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><h3>Additional Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<P>
If the problem still occurs, perform these steps. After performing each 
step, check to see if the issue has been resolved.

<OL><P><LI>Verify that the POP3 protocol is enabled for the site Protocols 
   container and the Protocols container on the server. 

<P><LI>Verify that POP3 support is not disabled for the user's mailbox. 

<P><LI>Verify that the client can ping the server using the server's Internet 
   protocol (IP) address and the server's computer name. 

<P><LI>Run the Rpings.exe tool that is located on the Microsoft Exchange 
   Server CD-ROM. Rpings.exe runs on the server; a client program must 
   also be run on the client. If you are running Windows or Windows for 
   Workgroups version 3.x, run Rpingc16.exe on the client. If you are 
   running Windows 95, Windows NT Server, or Windows NT Workstation, run 
   Rpingc32.exe on the client.
<P>
   NOTE: The Rpings.exe tool is used to determine if the client can 
   connect to the server using remote procedure call (RPC). POP3 clients 
   do not connect to the Microsoft Exchange Server computer using RPC.

<P><LI>Try to use the Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client to connect to the 
   server from the same computer on which Microsoft Exchange Server is 
   installed.

<P><LI>Try using a different e-mail client. For example, use the Microsoft 
   Exchange client and the Internet Mail information service included 
   with Microsoft Plus! or use Microsoft Internet Mail and News. The 
   Internet Mail information service is included with Windows NT Server 
   and Windows NT Workstation 4.0. For information about how to obtain 
   Internet Mail and News, please see the following article in the 
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE></OL>If the problem still occurs, contact the manufacturer of the e-mail 
client for additional assistance.
