The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Delivery Reports (DRs) received from another Microsoft Exchange Server may
only contain the Distinguished Name (DN) of the original recipient in the
envelope. This behaviour does not affect normal users, but if the DR is
received by an EDK based agent or gateway, it is no longer possible to
relate the DR to the original message. The DN used in the delivery report
is not usable, since the receiving Microsoft Exchange Server doesn't have
any information about the other Microsoft Exchange Organization.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behaviour can occur when the DR is generated by another Microsoft
Exchange Organization that is connected via a 88 X400 Connector and
Directory Replication is not configured between the two Organizations. As a
result, the X.400 O/R address is stripped from the DR and when the MTA
receives the DR, only the DN is left.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use a 1984 X400 connection instead of a 1988 X400 connection.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The hotfix is only needed if you are working with two Microsoft Exchange
Servers that do not have Directory Replication configured between them or
that are in differnet Organizations. Without the fix, a DR may contain only
a DN that references the user to whom a message was delivered succesfully.
<P>
The fix changes the handling of invalid DN's, so that the DR always
contains a valid, usable address. This address can be a O/R address or a
DN.
<P>
To install the fix, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Stop all Microsoft Exchange services.

<P><LI>Backup the following files from the &lt;path&gt;\exchsrvr\bin directory by
   renaming or copying them to another location:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ADDRESS.DLL, EMSMTA.EXE, MTACHECK.EXE, MMIEXT.DLL, SAALOG.DLL,
      EMS_RID.DLL, P2.XV2, X400OMV1.DLL
</PRE>
<P><LI>Backup the following files from the &lt;path&gt;\exchsrvr\mtadata directory by
   renaming or copying them to another location:
<P>
<P><PRE>      P2.XV2, INFOTLOG.CFG, INFODLOG.CFG, P3.TPL, DBSERVER.SCH, DCPRODS.CAT
</PRE>
<P><LI>Backup the following file from the &lt;path&gt;\exchsrvr\connect\msexcimc\bin
   directory by renaming or copying it to another location:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ADDRESS.DLL
</PRE>
<P><LI>Backup the following file from the &lt;path&gt;\exchsrvr\connect\msmcon\bin
   directory by renaming or copying it to another location:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ADDRESS.DLL (if existing)
</PRE>
<P><LI>Backup the following file from the &lt;path&gt;\exchsrvr\res directory by
   renaming or copying it to another location:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MTALOG.DLL
</PRE>
<P><LI>Backup the following file from the &lt;path&gt;\&lt;winntroot&gt;\system32 directory
   by renaming or copying it to another location:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MAPI32.DLL
</PRE>
<P><LI>Replace all the above files with the ones provided with the hotfix.

<P><LI>Restart all services stopped in step 1.
<P>
</OL>Please note that it might be necessary to reboot the computer in order for
the changes introduced with MAPI32.DLL to take effect.
