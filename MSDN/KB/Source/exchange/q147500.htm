The Information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to set up shared installations of Microsoft
Exchange version 4.0 clients.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The first thing an administrator needs to do is create a client
installation point. To do this, you need to:

<OL><P><LI>Run SETUP.EXE from the Microsoft Exchange Client compact disc and the
   correct language subdirectory.

<P><LI>Choose Change Folder to select the location of the client installation
   point.

<P><LI>Choose either Complete to create an installation point with all
   Exchange clients, or Custom to pick the subset of Exchange Clients
   that you want to make available.

<P><LI>After Setup is complete, share this folder with full access rights for
   the administrator.
<P>
</OL>To set up an Exchange Client network share for WINDOWS USERS, follow the
steps below:

<OL><P><LI>From File Manager on a computer running the same version of Windows
   that users will be running, connect to the client installation point.

<P><LI>Change to the appropriate subdirectory for this version of Windows. For
   Windows NT, also change to the subdirectory corresponding to the
   processor type: i386, ALPHA, MIPS, or Power PC.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Run.

<P><LI>In the Run box, type "setup /a".

<P><LI>Choose Change Folder to specify the location of the Exchange network
   share.

<P><LI>After Setup completes, share this folder with read access rights for
   all users.
<P>
</OL>You need to repeat the steps above for each version of Windows that
users will be running.
<P>
Users who are not running shared versions of Windows can then connect to
the Exchange network share created above and run SETUP.EXE, choosing the
Workstation option. Please note that although Windows NT cannot be
configured to run from a network share, Microsoft Exchange Client for
Windows NT can be run from a network share.
<P>
To set up an Exchange Client network share for MS-DOS USERS, follow the
steps below:

<OL><P><LI>Create an Exchange network share on a server with full access for the
   administrator and read access for the users.

<P><LI>From an MS-DOS computer, connect to the Exchange network share and the
   installation point.

<P><LI>From an MS-DOS computer, run SETUP.EXE in the DOS subdirectory on the
   installation point. Choose the Shared option to install client files
   on the Exchange network share.

<P><LI>Modify the user's logon script to automatically connect the client
   computer to the Exchange network share when the user logs on.
<P>
</OL>The MS-DOS Exchange users can then connect to the Exchange network share
and run SETUP.EXE, choosing the Workstation option.
<P>
For users who are running a SHARED COPY OF WINDOWS OR MS-DOS, the
administrator may need to:

<OL><P><LI>Create duplicate operating system network shares so that one copy of
   the share is available for existing system users and another copy is
   available to configure for users migrating to the Microsoft Exchange
   Client. If existing users are using MS Mail or Schedule+ 1.0, they
   will lose functionality if Microsoft Exchange is installed in the
   shared Windows directory.

<P><LI>Make sure the clients and the computer used to set up the Microsoft
   Exchange Client network share are running the same shared copy of
   Windows and install Microsoft Exchange files in the Windows \SYSTEM
   directory on the network share server.

<P><LI>Verify that there is a shared directory on a server to use as the home
   directory for each user. The user must have read and write access to
   the contents in the directory.

<P><LI>Modify the user's logon script to automatically connect the client
   computer to the Microsoft Exchange network share and to the user's home
   directory when the user logs on.
<P>
</OL>The users running a shared copy of Windows or MS-DOS will then run
SETUP.EXE from the Exchange network share to install the Exchange client
software. They must specify the Workstation option and the path to their
home directory while running Setup.
