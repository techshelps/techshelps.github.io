The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client version 4.0
</UL> 
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>Symptoms</h2>
 
<P>
When you open or receive mail in the Microsoft Exchange client, one of the
following error messages may occur:
<P>
<PRE>   Exchng32.exe - No Disk
   There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into &lt;drive&gt;:

   -or-

   WMS Spooler: Mapisp32.exe - No Disk

   -or-

   OleMainThreadWndName: Mapisp32.exe - No Disk

</PRE>NOTE: If you select the Abort option, the message box clears. Selecting
Retry or Ignore only works if a floppy disk is inserted into the drive.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the PATH statement in the Autoexec.bat file,
Windows NT System Environment Variables, or User Environment Variables
for &lt;user name&gt; refers to a floppy disk drive or CD-ROM drive.
<P>
If the Autoexec.bat file refers to a floppy disk or CD-ROM drive, Windows
NT 4.0 does not display the error when you log on, but when you run
applications.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, you should either have a disk in the drive or
remove the entry from the PATH statement.
<P>
The drive letter may not be entered in the PATH statement, but may
be found in the following registry location:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\SETUP\WinntPath

</PRE>Delete the entry here and log back in.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a user logs on to their account, Windows NT searches for an
Autoexec.bat file in the root directory of drive C. If the file is found,
Ntvdm.exe appends its PATH environment variable to the system PATH
environment variable. Only the DOS virtual machine (VDM) PATH variable is
affected.
<P>
Ntvdm.exe tests the PATH statement for validity. If the drive physically
exists, Ntvdm.exe tests for the drive type (removable media or fixed). If
the drive is a floppy disk or CD-ROM, Ntvdm.exe tests for the presence of
valid media. If no valid media is found, the error message is displayed. If
invalid drives are used in the Autoexec.bat PATH statement, no error
message is displayed; however, the PATH variable in any previously opened
VDMs may be invalid.
<P>
For more information, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WINNT/Q102418.htm">Q102418</A></B>
   TITLE     : NTVDM Error: There Is No Disk in the Drive

</PRE>This problem can also occur after you save an attachment to removable
media, and then eject the media. For example, when you save an attachment
to a zip drive, and then eject the disk and attempt to open another
message, the error message appears. To work around this problem, insert a
new disk in to the same drive and open a message.
