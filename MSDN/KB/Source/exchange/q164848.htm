The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
There are two known problems with Exchange 95 clients transmitting messages
using SPX over dialup connections.  The second problem will not be seen until
the first is resolved.
<P>
The first problem encountered appears as the following error in Windows 95:
<P>
<PRE>   An exception 0E has occurred at 0028:c00175e6 in VxD NWLINK(01) + 0000438A.
   This was called from 0028:c0017014 in VxD NWLINK(01) + 00003db8. It may
   be possible to continue normally.

</PRE>Nwlink.vxd is accepting packets larger than max frame size. The exception
causes the machine to hang. For more information, please see the following 
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q164474.htm">Q164474</A></B>
   TITLE:      OE Exception in NWLINK Sending Message from Microsoft Exchange

</PRE>The second problem:
<P>
The real problem is exposed once the Nwlink.vxd problem is remedied. The
Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client will hang when attempting to transmit
a packet greater than 1160 bytes over a dialup connection using SPX.
<P>
This occurs because Wsipx.vxd submits a larger frame than is supported.
SPX checks the max NDIS packet frame size against the max frame size for
the connection and fails.  NDIS packet frame size is 1497 bytes and max
frame is 1160. For more information, please see the following article in the 
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../WIN95X/Q163378.htm">Q163378</A></B>
   TITLE:      Microsoft Exchange Hangs Sending Message Using SPX

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Connect to the Microsoft Exchange Server before launching the Microsoft 
Exchange client.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95. A supported fix
is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and should be
applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft 
Product Support Services for more information.
