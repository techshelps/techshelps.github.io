</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In a multiple site environment, Microsoft Exchange Server computers behave
in much the same way as they do in a single site environment regarding the
passing of Organization-related information. The types of data which must
be exchanged or transferred between servers are described below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Below is a list of the type of data and the corresponding Microsoft
Exchange Service necessary to establish Site connector replication.
<P>
Type of DataResponsible Exchange Service
 
Directory replication ChangesDirectory Service (DS)
Public Folder Replication ChangesPublic Information Store (IS)
Public Folder Hierarchy ChangesPublic Information Store (IS)
Mail Messages (IPM's)Private Information Store (IS)
Link Monitor Messages System Attendant (SA via the IS)
Directory Synchronization MessagesDirectory Synchronization (DX)
<P>
In a multiple site environment, the Message Transfer Agent (MTA) is
responsible for ALL transfer of data; regardless of type.
<P>
Upon successfully establishing a site connector, mail should flow between
sites using one-off addressing. If mail does not flow, the connection has
not been successfully established. A Directory Replication Connector must
be configured for site information to be shared between Microsoft Exchange
Servers. Only Microsoft Exchange Servers within the same site will
replicate information automatically.
<P>
Directory replication will occur when the administrator has set up
Directory Replication. This is done in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
program under File, New Other, Directory Replication Connector.
<P>
When selecting the Directory Replication Connector, an error may appear
stating:
<P>
<PRE>  Directory Replication Connectors cannot be created in the selected parent
  container. Do you want to switch to the 'Directory Replication' container
  of the site 'SITENAME'?

</PRE>This means that the container selected is not the correct one for a
directory replication connector. Select OK to automatically move to the
correct container.
<P>
At this point a 'Stub' should appear on the container side of the
Administrator screen. A stub contains the Site Name, Recipient, and the
Configuration containers which are blank until full replication has
occurred.
<P>
Replication is a background process and cannot be limited to a certain time
frame. Factors such as network traffic, number of servers replicating to,
and server processes may influence replication time.
<P>
There is no manual process which reduces replication time. Replication will
occur if configured properly.
