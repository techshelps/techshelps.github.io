<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The MS Mail Connector Interchange (MSMI) may terminate unexpectedly with
the following events reported to the application log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 2380
   Source: MSExchangeMSMI
   Description:
   A memory access violation has occurred that prevents further processing
   of a message. The access violation that occurred is an attempt to read
   from 0x480df78. Please refer to the immediately following event(s)
   logged by MS Mail Connector Interchange  for more information on the
   message that could not be processed. (Exception address: 0x4496c2.)

</PRE>NOTE: The exception addresses above are examples; they will not match
exactly every time.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The MSMI is freeing a block of heap memory before the actual process is
done with it. When the process tries to access this freed area of memory,
an access violation occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.
A supported fix to this problem is in development, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that
contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information
on the availability of this fix.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 5.0 Server U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
