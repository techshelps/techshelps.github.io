The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are working remotely with the Microsoft Exchange client for
Windows 3.x and Windows for Workgroups 3.x, and initiate a remote dial-up
connection to a Microsoft Exchange Server from within the client by opening
the Tools menu and clicking Deliver Now..., the dial-up connection fails
either silently, or after repeatedly presenting a Shiva credentials dialog
prompting for your User Name and Password.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In the case of the silent failure, additional symptoms may include that the
progress bar displays Connecting to Microsoft Exchange Server... and then
the modem disconnects, yet the Inbox viewer appears. Verify that your
Microsoft Exchange Server is operational and that your NT domain password
has not expired.
<P>
In the case of the credentials dialog box appearing and then re-appearing
after filling it in and clicking OK, your NT domain password may have
expired, or you may be otherwise failing domain credentials validation.
<P>
Note that, "Tools, Deliver Now...", is not the most appropriate "transfer
or connection engagement" mechanism when using the Microsoft Exchange
Client remotely or in offline mode (see MORE INFORMATION, below).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version
4.00. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two issues to be considered here: informing you of conditions
that require corrective action and providing a mechanism to take corrective
action.
<P>
Informing you:
<P>
When using the Microsoft Exchange Client remotely and/or working offline,
"Tools, Deliver Now..." is not the best option for initiating a connection
to a Microsoft Exchange Server and transferring mail.
<P>
"Tools, Deliver Now..." operates in a mode that minimizes dialog popup. It
is the same mode used for scheduled connections. The assumption is that no
one may be present to respond to error dialogs or conditions, and
therefore, communication, authentication, or operational errors returned
during these operations do not result in dialog popups.
<P>
When working remotely or offline, the "Remote Mail, Tools, Connect"
mechanism or "Tools, Synchronize, &lt;option&gt;" mechanism operates in a mode
that assumes the user is present and thus returns communication,
authentication, and operational errors to the user. These options are the
recommended mechanisms for initiating a connection to a Microsoft Exchange
Server and transferring mail when working remotely or offline.
<P>
The problem documented in this article is that the error handling chain
from ShivaRemote to the Microsoft Exchange Client was not returning the
proper error message when using the "Remote Mail" or "Synchronize"
mechanisms.
<P>
The "expired domain password" condition can be confirmed by launching a
Shiva Remote dial-up connection within Windows or Windows for Workgroups,
outside of Microsoft Exchange. If the domain password has expired, you will
receive the following dialog:
<P>
<PRE>   Your authentication attempt has failed; your password has expired.

</PRE>Alternatively, after applying the latest service pack, the following
messages are returned when using the corresponding mechanisms:
<P>
<PRE>   Tools.Synchronize.This Folder - a Shiva credentials dialog will appear
   prompting for "User Name" and "Password". Afterwards, the dialog:

      This folder could not be synchronized. Your password has expired.

   Tools.Remote Mail.Connect - a Shiva credentials dialog will popup
   prompting for "User Name" and "Password". Afterwards, the dialog:

      An error occurred during the connection: Your password has expired.

</PRE>Corrective actions:
<P>
There is no mechanism in the Microsoft Exchange Client to allow you to
change your NT domain password after it has expired. The client's password
change mechanism assumes a connection to the Microsoft Exchange Server is
available. In the case of remote dial-up, you must first have a valid
network connection before you can access either your Microsoft Exchange
Server or your Primary Domain Controller (PDC).
<P>
The ShivaRemote software installed with the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x
client does not support Windows NT Networking APIs for password changes.
<P>
Workarounds:
<P>
The best option for accommodating remote mail users is to use Windows 95 or
Windows NT for dial-in clients because they natively support NT RAS dial-in
and NT password change APIs. However, marginal workarounds exist for
specific cases when using Windows for Workgroups or when dialing into a
Shiva LanRover.
<P>
<PRE>   - If dialing into a Shiva LanRover:

      1. Start the Shiva connection outside of Microsoft Exchange and
         establish a connection.
      2. In Control Panel, Network, Logon(\Off), log off and then Log on.
         This should engage the mechanism for changing an expired Windows
         NT domain password.
      3. Start the Microsoft Exchange Client and provide the new domain
         credentials. If your profile has disabled the Tools, Services,
         Microsoft Exchange Server, Advanced, Use Network Security During
         Logon checkbox. You will still have to synchronize all the
         passwords that Windows caches in the &lt;username&gt;.PWL or elsewhere.

   - If dialing into a Shiva LanRover from Windows 3.1 to a Novell network
     where Windows NT PDCs and Microsoft Exchange Servers run FPNW &amp; GSNW:

      1. Start the Shiva connection outside of Microsoft Exchange and
         establish a connection.
      2. On the Windows 3.1 computer, run the Chngpass.exe utility included
         with FPNW. This should change the Windows NT domain password and
         FPNW password. Chngpass.exe requires an SPX connection to the
         PDC.
      3. Start the Microsoft Exchange Client and provide the new domain
         credentials if your profile has disabled the Tools,
         Services, Microsoft Exchange Server, Advanced, Use Network
         Security During Logon checkbox.

   - On a Windows for Workgroups computer dialing into Windows NT RAS, it
     is possible to also have Windows for Workgroups RAS installed, and you
     can attempt a RAS connection. You will be informed that the domain
     password has expired and the dialog to change it will be presented.
     Care must be taken that Shiva's updates of NETBEUI.386 and
     NDIS2SUP.386 are not overwritten by Windows for Workgroups RAS's
     earlier version. You will still have to synchronize all the passwords
     that Windows caches in the &lt;username&gt;.PWL or elsewhere.
