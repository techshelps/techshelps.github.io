<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Microsoft Exchange Migration Wizard to migrate accounts to
a Microsoft Exchange Server computer, the following error may be generated
in the Application event log
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 283
   Source: MSExchangeMIGDS
   Description: Could not remove object &lt;UserID&gt; because the directory
   service reported the following error: Changes cannot be written to
   this directory object. Try connecting to a Microsoft Exchange
   Server computer in the same site as this object.

</PRE>where &lt;UserID&gt; is the ID of a user who already exists on the Microsoft
Exchange server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To migrate these users, it will be necessary to remove the existing
recipients from their home server. To do this, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Log on to the Windows NT domain using the Microsoft Exchange Service
   Account or an account that has administrative permissions for the
   Microsoft Exchange Server.

<P><LI>Use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program to remove the
   custom recipient or mailbox object for the user that you are trying
   to migrate from the appropriate recipients container.

<P><LI>Allow time for directory replication to occur between the
   recipient's home server and the target server. This will remove the
   user from the Global Address List (GAL) of the target server. If
   you wish to force directory replication to occur, select the Update
   Now button located on the General tab of the target server's
   Directory Service Properties dialog.

<P><LI>Run the Microsoft Exchange Migration Wizard again.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This error may occur if you have insufficient rights or permissions to the
Microsoft Exchange Directory. In this case, make sure that you are logged
into the Windows NT domain as a user with sufficient access to the
Microsoft Exchange Directory.
<P>
This error may also occur if an existing mailbox or custom recipient is
homed on one server in a site and an attempt is made to migrate an account
to a server in a different site. Microsoft Exchange will attempt to remove
the existing recipient from the target server and replace it with a new
mailbox for the migrated account. Since the recipient does not actually
exist on the target server (it is homed on another server in another site),
it cannot be removed.
