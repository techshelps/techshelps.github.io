The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In some Microsoft Exchange topologies, there may be cases where a message
is constantly re-routed. The configuration where this occurs is as
follows:

<OL><P><LI>There must be at least two X.400 Connectors that the message can be
   routed to. Typically each connector will have the route c=* in the
   Address Space tab of their properties page in the Microsoft Exchange
   Administrator program.
</OL>2. These connectors do not have any Connected Sites information.
3. These connectors are configured as 1984.
4. The message has been addressed to an Exchange user in another site
<PRE>   whose address is in another user's personal address book (PAB).
   The PAB entry has become invalid either because they have been
   deleted from the system or their original Exchange Site no longer
   exists in the organization. If you use the Message Tracking feature
   in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, this will show up
   as a Distinguished Name (DN), in other words:

      /O=&lt;org&gt;/OU=&lt;site&gt;/CN=Recipients/CN=&lt;DN of recipient&gt;.

</PRE></OL>The tracking log will show that the failing message is constantly
re-routed, and the Windows NT Event Log will show the following events
every time a re-route occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 175
   Source: MSExchangeMTA
   Category: X.400 Service
   Description:
      (MTA DISP:RESULT(23) Proc 147) 11-17-97 01:41:11pm
      Transfer-Out failure, failed to downgrade per-rcpt-info

   Event ID : 287
   Source : MSEXchangeMTA
   Category : X.400 Service
   Description:
      (MTA DISP:RESULT(22) Proc 436) 11-17-97 01:41:11pm
      Successful rerouting
      MTS Identifier    C=US;A= ;P=MICROSOFT;L=JUNWIN03-971117134110Z-4
      New Connector     /O=MICROSOFT/OU=MILTON
</PRE>KEYNES/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=CONNECTIONS/CN=X400 84 TCP TO MARGATE
<PRE>      New Target entity /O=MICROSOFT/OU=MILTON
</PRE>KEYNES/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=CONNECTIONS/CN=X400 84 TCP TO MARGATE
<PRE>      Old Connector
      Old Target entity /O=MICROSOFT/OU=MILTON
</PRE>KEYNES/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=CONNECTIONS/CN=X400 84 TCP TO MARGATE 2
<P>
The sender of the message will eventually receive a non-delivery report
(NDR) containing the following diagnostic information:
<P>
<PRE>   Either the size of this message exceeds your maximum allowed message
   size or you have exceeded the storage limit on your mailbox.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The message is being re-routed to the other connector, and this looping
continues until the diagnostic information on the message eventually
grows too big and the message is NDR'ed. The message is routed to the
group of connectors that can send the message, but in this case only
the 1984 connectors can do this, and they do not have Connected Sites
information. The Microsoft Exchange message transfer agent (MTA) cannot
downgrade the message to be sent and should NDR it with:
<P>
<PRE>   The recipient could not be transferred because it could not be
   downgraded.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The workaround for this is to use versions of the MTA greater than or
equal to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Exchange 4.0 : 996.56 - or use Exchange 4.0 SP5
   Exchange 5.0 : 1459.72 - or use Exchange 5.0 SP2
   Exchange 5.5 : 2110.00 - or use Exchange 5.5 SP1

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
