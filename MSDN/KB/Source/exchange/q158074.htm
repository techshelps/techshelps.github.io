<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
ShivaRemote software can be used with the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client
to allow users to remotely access a computer running Microsoft Exchange
Server (either by means of a computer running Windows NT with RAS or Shiva
LanRover). This article discusses the steps necessary to install and
configure the ShivaRemote software that ships with Microsoft Exchange
Client to work specifically over the IPX protocol. (For information about
setting up Shiva for use over other protocols, see the Reference section
below).
<P>
When using ShivaRemote with the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, you must
first run Connect.exe from the Microsoft Exchange Client directory,
establish the remote connection, and then start the Microsoft Exchange MS-
DOS client. This is necessary because the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client
does not have any built-in remote functionality. Therefore, with the
Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, there is no way to download only the
message headers (remote mail functionality).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You may see the following error message:

<UL><LI>Warning: Your IPX network number changed during connection. IPX
   services may not function properly.
<P>
</UL>This error should not cause a problem using the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS
client. Simply press ENTER and continue. In the Microsoft Exchange Windows
3.x client, the IPX network number assigned to your computer changed while
you were connected to the remote access server. This can happen if you dial
in to two different remote networks in one session without restarting your
computer between connections. If you are using the Novell NetWare VLMs
Version 1.2 or later and ShivaRemote 3.5, you can ignore this error message
and your IPX-dependent software will function without errors. The later
versions of the VLMs have been designed to handle this problem better than
earlier versions. This warning message can be turned off by editing the
Sremote.ini file and changing the following line:
<P>
<PRE>   [Options] NotifyIPXAddress=No

</PRE>If you are not using the NetWare VLMs, or if you are using a version of
VLMs earlier than version 1.2, close the Dial-In connection and restart
your computer. Then dial in to the remote network again.
<P>
<P><h3>Installation of the Software</h3>
 
<P>
During installation of the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client there is a
dialog box to select whether or not ShivaRemote should be installed. There
is not a separate Setup program for the MS-DOS version of ShivaRemote.
Therefore, if you are an MS-DOS-based user and you install the Microsoft
Exchange MS-DOS client without ShivaRemote, and at a later date require it,
you will need to rerun Setup of the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client. For
MS-DOS, all of the ShivaRemote files are copied to the Microsoft Exchange
client directory.
<P>
Follow these steps to configure ShivaRemote for dial-in:

<OL><P><LI>Manually edit your Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Config.sys
      ----------
      device=c:\dos\setver.exe
      device=c:\dos\himem.sys
      device=c:\dos\emm386.exe noems
      shell=c:\dos\command.com /p
      dos=high,umb
      lastdrive=z
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      autoexec.bat
      ------------
      c:\&lt;path&gt;\lsl.com
      c:\exchange_dir\dialodi.exe
      c:\&lt;path&gt;\ipxodi
      c:\&lt;path&gt;\vlm (or netx)
      set exchange=c:\exchange_dir
      set RPC_Binding_Order=ncacn_np,ncalrpc,ncacn_spx,netbios
</PRE><P>
   The net.cfg (nwclient directory)
   --------------------------------
<P>
<P><PRE>      preferred server=servername
      Link Driver DIALODI
</PRE><P>
   Make sure you receive no error messages when starting with the newly
   configured Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files.

<P><LI>Run Connect.exe from the Microsoft Exchange install directory.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Port Setup, and select the appropriate modem
   and com port.

<P><LI>Click the Options button and select the IPX (only) check box.

<P><LI>Specify a Description, Dial-in-Name (a Windows NT account that has been
   granted dial-in access on the server), Password (a password for the
   Windows NT account you are dialing in on), and Phone number. Note the
   account does not necessarily have to be the Exchange Mailbox Primary
   Windows NT account.

<P><LI>Dial the computer running RAS. (Microsoft Exchange Server supports
   dialing into either a Windows NT RAS server or a Shiva LanRover.)

<P><LI>Once connected, quit ShivaRemote Connect (on the File menu, click Exit).
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The connection is maintained until you start Connect.exe again and
click Disconnect.

<OL><P><LI>Start the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client. Type the User Name (Exchange
   Mailbox Name), the Password (Windows NT Domain Password), and the Domain
   (Windows NT Domain Name that your Account is in).
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCE</h2>
 
<P>
Updated modem scripts for use with ShivaRemote can be found on Shiva's
Web page at www.shiva.com under "support"/modem scripts.
<P>
Additional configuration information may also be found in the config.hlp
file installed during installation of the ShivaRemote software.
