<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes some of the reasons why Microsoft Exchange Server 
Directory Replication can take longer than expected.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are factors that could affect the speed of Directory 
Replication within Microsoft Exchange Sites as well between Sites.

<OL><P><LI>Check the Microsoft Exchange Server Message Transfer Agent(MTA) queues
   to make sure that messages are flowing out of the queues at a reasonable
   rate. Directory Replication between Sites is message based and if
   messages are not flowing, Directory Replication will not take place. If
   the MTA is bogged down with messages, this maybe be due to excessive
   processor load, insufficient hardware, or insufficient memory, among
   other reasons.

<P><LI>Check the load on the sending and receiving Microsoft Exchange Servers.
   This can be done using the Windows NT Performance Monitor and looking at
   the %Processor Time counter of the Processor Object. If the %Processor
   Time is consistently high (above 80%) determine which process is useing
   most of the CPU cycles.
<P>
   If possible, stop the CPU intensive processes until the Directory
   Replication is complete. Make sure that you are not running CPU 
   intensive programs, like an OpenGL screen saver (like Pipes), that may
   unnecessarily take up CPU cycles.
<P>
   It is beneficial to run Performance Monitor from a computer other than the
   one you are monitoring. This will allow you to catch screen saver processes
   running on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

<P><LI>If the number of addresses being replicated is very large, do not
   repeatedly manually request an update of all entries in the Global Address
   List.

<P><LI>Check the replication schedule. For the purpose of getting the
   replication done as soon as possible, it may be advisable to set the
   replication schedule to Always.

<P><LI>Check the topology of your Microsoft Exchange Organization. It may be
   possible that changes made to the Directory take a while to propagate to
   all parts of the Organization, if the number of intermediate hops is large.
<P>
