The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
File attachments received in messages that are received from the Internet
have icon descriptions that are not the filename.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The sending party for the message used a MIME property called Content-
Description described in RFC 1521 section 6.2 (shown below).
<P>
RFC 1521
<P>
*************************************************************************
6.2.  Optional Content-Description Header Field
<P>
<PRE>   The ability to associate some descriptive information with a given
   body is often desirable. For example, it may be useful to mark an
   "image" body as "a picture of the Space Shuttle Endeavor."  Such text
   may be placed in the Content-Description header field.

   description := "Content-Description" ":" *text

   The description is presumed to be given in the US-ASCII character
   set, although the mechanism specified in [RFC-1522] may be used for
   non-US-ASCII Content-Description values.
</PRE>*************************************************************************
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 uses the Content-Description MIME
property to preserve the icon description through the Internet. The
original filename is preserved and can be different than the icon
description.
<P>
With the Microsoft Exchange client, when an attachment is inserted into a
message, the default icon description is set to the filename.  The user can
right-mouse click on a file attachment in a message being composed, and
choose "rename" to change the icon description.  Changing the icon
description does not change the filename.
<P>
If a remote system sends attachments and uses the Content-Description MIME
property, Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 will honor the provided
data and use it as the icon description.  If the remote system doesn't send
meaningful data in the Content-Description MIME property, this behavior may
be confusing when receiving attachments from that system.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If a remote system sends Content-Description MIME properties that are not
meaningful, attempt to configure the remote system to suppress the sending
of this MIME property.  Mail received without this MIME property will have
icon descriptions that are set to the filename.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has added a new registry value to the Information Store service
that allows an administrator the option of forcing the Information Store
to ignore the Content-Description MIME property for incoming Internet mail.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
To enable this feature to ignore the Content-Description MIME property,
perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Go to the following key in the registry:
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIs
<PRE>                     \ParametersSystem\InternetContent\


</PRE><P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Add Value and use the following entry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: IgnoreContentDescription
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
<PRE></PRE>      Value:      1

</PRE><P><LI>Exit the Registry Editor and restart the Information Store service
   for the change to take effect.
<P>
</OL>Setting the IgnoreContentDescription to 1 causes the Information Store to
ignore the Content-Description MIME property when determining the icon
description.  To restore the behavior, either delete the registry value
or set it to a value of 0 and restart the Information Store.
<P>
It is recommended that Microsoft Exchange administrators consider the
ramifications of making this change.  If important information is
communicated via the icon description field from other internet sites (or
Microsoft Exchange 5.0 Sites across internet connectors), these
descriptions will be lost.
