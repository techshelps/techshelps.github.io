<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a list of 14 questions and answers dealing with Microsoft
Exchange message and attachment size limitations and the number of messages
and attachments that can be stored.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI> Q. What is the limit to the number of addresses in the header fields?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. That depends on the client platform. The Win16 limit is smaller than
       the Win32 limit, but we have tested with 1500+ on Win16 and 2000+ on
       Win32. These are total recipients because we count To:, Cc:, and
       Bcc: objects, although Distribution Lists count as 1. There is no
       hard limit, it is based on the amount of memory available on the
       client computer.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What is the limit to the number of distribution lists that can be
<P><PRE>       included in the To:, Cc:, and Bcc: fields?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. It's the same as the limit on the number of addresses.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What is the limit to the number of attachments that can be sent with
<P><PRE>       a single message?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. None, it's based on available disk space. There is a 16GB limit on
       the Microsoft Exchange Server store.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What is the limit to the total size of a message?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. The total size of the message, including attachments, is only
       limited by the 16GB Microsoft Exchange Server store limit. However,
       the text of the message is limited to 1MEG.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What is the limit to the number of Distribution List nesting levels
<P><PRE>       for hierarchical Distribution Lists?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. None.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What is the limit to the number of folder nesting levels?
<P>
<P><PRE>    A. None.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What is the limit to the number of names that can be contained in a
<P><PRE>       Distribution List?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. 5,000
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What is the limit to the number of items that can be contained in a
<P><PRE>       single folder?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. In the personal folders store (PST), it's 16,000. In the Microsoft
       Exchange Server store, there is no limit. Again, it's based on the
       16GB storage limit.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Q. What is the limit to the number of messages that can held in the
<P><PRE>       Inbox?
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    A. In the PST, the basic limitation is that 16,000 messages can be
       stored in a single folder. In the Microsoft Exchange Server, there
       is no limit. The administrator may set a user quota. If the quota is
       exceeded, the user will not be allowed to create or send new
       messages but they will still receive messages. The quota is based on
       size, not number of messages. In all of this, the only real limit is
       that the Microsoft Exchange Server store cannot be larger than 16GB.
       The number of messages that will fit into the 16GB is the real limit
       and with single instance storage the actual limit is much higher.
</PRE>
<PRE>10. Q. What is the limit to the number of messages that can be held in the
       Outbox?

    A. All folders are the same, so it's 16,000 for a PST and no limit for
       the Microsoft Exchange Server store.

11. Q. Is there a limit to the number of times a message can be forwarded?

    A. No, however, Microsoft Exchange does perform loop detection for
       forward rules and that limit is 240.

12. Q. What is the limit to the size of messages that can be sent via
       gateways or the MTA?

    A. None, however the Administrator can set limits at each link point
       (MTA to MTA or out gateways). If a message exceeds that limit, the
       user will receive an Non-Delivery Report stating that they have
       exceeded the size limit.

13. Q. What is the limit to the number of attachments that can be sent via
       gateways or the MTA?

    A. None. The administrative limits can be applied here also, so limits
       can be set for controlling the throughput of a link.

14. Q. What is size limit for an individual's message store?

    A. None. The administrator can set quotas on the Microsoft Exchange
       Server store, but that is an administrative control issue.
