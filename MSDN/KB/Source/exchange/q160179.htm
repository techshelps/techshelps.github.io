<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There is no built-in utility to move a user from one recipient container to
another. To move a user from one recipient container to another:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure the user has all his or her mail in a local .pst file. Also
   make sure that if the user uses Schedule+ he or she also has a local
   Schedule+ file.

<P><LI>Delete the user and then re-create the user in the recipient container
   that you want the user to be in.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An alternative way to move a user from one recipient container to another:

<OL><P><LI>Export the user into a .csv file and then delete the user.

<P><LI>Import the user into the proper container.
<P>
</OL>This method saves you the step of having to re-create all the user's
information. A complete CSV file with all possible headers can be found on
the Exchange Server CD under Support\Samples\Csvs\Mailbox\Mailbox.csv.
Exporting to this file will ensure that all attributes are preserved. You
still have to manually move mail to local .pst and Schedule+ files.
