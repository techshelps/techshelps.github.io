The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start a Microsoft Exchange Windows client, the main application
window may take a relatively long time to load after the startup screen
appears.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can significantly improve startup time by properly configuring the RPC
binding order on the machine running the Microsoft Exchange client:

<OL><P><LI>Use the Microsoft Exchange Setup Editor to adjust the RPC binding order.
   The Setup Editor is installed on the server, with the Microsoft Exchange
   Administrator program.

<P><LI>In the Setup Editor, choose the Modify Setup Program Options command on
   the File menu. This brings up the Setup Program Options property sheet.

<P><LI>Select the Binding Order property page. Modify the RPC protocols
   according to your network configuration and delete those protocols not
   being used.
<P>
</OL>For example, if the client is communicating with the Microsoft Exchange
Server using the TCP/IP protocol, use the Setup Editor to remove all the
protocols defined except the TCP/IP protocol.
<P>
The Setup Editor must be run against a client installation share point.
After you use the Setup Editor to make changes, users must run SETUP.EXE
from the client installation share point and install or reinstall the
client as necessary.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the Microsoft Exchange client starts up, it uses the first protocol in
the RPC binding order to attempt to communicate with the Microsoft Exchange
Server. If this attempt fails, the Microsoft Exchange client then uses the
next protocol in the binding order, and so on, until it has established
communication with the server or it has run out of protocols. In the latter
case, an error message is displayed and the user is asked if he or she
would like to work offline.
<P>
Hence, if the protocol installed on the client machine is at the top of the
binding order, the client will establish communication with the server in
the first attempt and will not have to time out and go down the binding
order. This can significantly reduce the startup time.
<P>
NOTE: The information in this article only applies to setting the RPC
binding order for the 16-bit Windows, Windows NT, and Windows 95 clients.
It does not apply to the MS-DOS client as a different setup method is
employed.
