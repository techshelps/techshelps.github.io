The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You might receive the following error message either when starting a
Microsoft Exchange client or after receiving a new message that a rule
attempts to process.
<P>
<PRE>   Title : Rules in Error
   Rule
   Subject:xxxMOVE TO:&lt;unavailable&gt;
   Error:
   Failed to perform client side action

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Personal Folder is password protected and the proper password has not
been entered. This problem can occur under two circumstances:

<UL><LI>Assume you quit from Microsoft Exchange and a personal folder has the
   focus. The next time you start Microsoft Exchange, you are prompted for
   the password immediately. In this case, the rule can find the folder and
   processes correctly.
<P>
   If, however, when you quit Microsoft Exchange, the Mailbox has focus
   (instead of a personal folder), the rule tries to process before knowing
   the password to the personal folder and the "Rules in error" message
   appears. Any mail messages that were to be copied to the personal
   folder, will instead appear in the Inbox of the Mailbox.

<LI>You cancel a personal folder password dialog without typing the
   password during startup of the Microsoft Exchange client, and a message
   is received (at any point) that the Inbox Assistant attempts to process
   (copy or move) to that personal folder. Because the personal folder
   cannot be opened, the rule cannot be processed.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When you exit Microsoft Exchange, place focus on a personal folder (not the
Mailbox).
<P>
When you start Microsoft Exchange, enter the password for (any) personal
folders involved with rules processing.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 4.0 of the
Microsoft Exchange clients for Windows 3.x and Windows NT. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
