The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector (IMC) to send
SMTP mail the IMC may try to send messages to itself. When this happens,
users will receive non-delivery reports (NDRs).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is an NDR that a user might receive:
<P>
<PRE>   FROM:  System Administrator [postmaster@Org.Site.Com]
   DATE:  Monday, May 13, 1996  9:29 AM
   TO:  Test User
   SUBJECT:  Undeliverable:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

      To: user@microsoft.com
      Subject: Subject of message
      Sent:    5/13/96  9:29:16 AM

   The following recipients(s) could not be reached:

      user@microsoft.com on 5/13/96 9:29:16 AM
         Recipient Not Found
         [MSEXCH:IMC:Organization:Site:SERVER]

</PRE>This problem occurs if the IMC is using DNS for the host name resolution.
When the IMC attempts to resolve a host, it will attempt to query the DNS
server for the host's IP address. If a site uses an MX wildcard record, it
will direct all mail to that site. This could mean that the IMC will try to
send mail to it's own IP address. The following scenario could help explain
this:
<P>
The computer running the IMC is located in the a.com domain and there's an
MX wildcard record of *.a.com in the DNS.
<P>
The IMC will add a.com to any address except ones ending in a.com. Any
address that ends in a.com will use the address expressed through the MX
wildcard record.
<P>
Since every address the Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA)
tries to resolve will end in a.com, all mail will go to the same Microsoft
Exchange Server. This may be the Microsoft Exchange Server that the IMC is
running on.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are experiencing this problem with the IMC, you can add a registry
value to prevent it. The registry key is:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\
   Services\MSExchangeIMC\PARAMETERS

</PRE>From the Registry Editor menu, click on Edit, then the Add Value option
from there.
<P>
<PRE>   Value Name: DisableResolverSearchList
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: 1 (or any non-zero value)

</PRE>This is case sensitive and should be typed exactly as show above. You will
need to restart the IMC for the registry key to take effect. Then
you can use Restest.exe to see if it worked. This utility can be found on
the Microsoft Exchange Server CD-ROM in the Support\Utils\I386 directory.
