The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Import.exe 5.15, all messages you send to cc:Mail post offices
generate the following non-delivery report (NDR):
<P>
<PRE>   Your message was not delivered to all recipients
   The cause of the failure(s) is listed below
        ***  Unknown Date Format  ***

</PRE>You may also see the following event in the Microsoft Exchange Server
computer's Windows NT Event Viewer Application log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 63

   Lotus cc:Mail IMPORT from file *.ccm returned result code 5.
   Undeliverable message or updates.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail creates *.ccm files
for Import.exe to send to the cc:Mail post office. Import.exe 5.15 picks
its date format from the locale set in Windows NT.  If there is a
mismatch between the date in the *.ccm file and the date format used by
Import.exe, the above error message will be generated.
<P>
When the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail detects the Unknown
Date Format non-delivery report, it makes one attempt to correct this by
forcing the *.ccm file into US date format. If the Windows NT locale is
using a US date format, then the problem will be resolved and subsequent
messages should not fail. However, if the Windows NT locale is using a non-
US date format, then forcing the *.ccm files into US date format will not
resolve the problem, and all messages will continue to fail.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 5.0 and 5.5.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
Import.exe is provided by Lotus Inc., a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem only applies when you are using version 5.12-5.15 of
Import.exe. It does not apply to Import.exe version 6, because the cc:Mail
connector uses a different method to set the date format.
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail initially generates the
*.ccm files for Import.exe with the date format defined by the Post Office
Language on the Post Office page of the Connector for cc:Mail. Import.exe
uses the date format defined by the Windows NT locale. If the *.ccm file
date format does not match the Import.exe format, an Unknown Date Format
NDR is generated.
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail attempts to resolve this
by setting the Locale Date Format registry parameter to 1 (Force US *.ccm
date format):
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
      System
         CurrentControlSet
            Services
               MSExchangeCCMC
                  Parameters

</PRE>After Locale Date Format is non zero, it will never be changed again.
Setting Locale Date Format to 1 overrides the date format defined
by the Post Office Language on the Post Office page and forces it to be
US date format.
<P>
This will resolve the problem if Import.exe is using US date format.
However, if Import.exe is using a non US date format, there will still be a
mismatch and messages will not be delivered. This can occur if the Windows
NT locale is a non US date format.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, apply the hotfix described above. This allows two
additional settings for Locale Date Format:
<P>
Locale Date Format 2 --&gt; Force European *.ccm date format (dd/mm/yy)
Locale Date Format 3 --&gt; Force Japanese *.ccm date format (yy/mm/dd)
<P>
By manually editing the Locale Date Format, you can force the *.ccm file
date format to match the Windows NT date format. As above, after the
service detects that the Locale Date Format is non zero, it will never be
changed again.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe as appropriate for
   your version of Windows NT).

<P><LI>Modify the setting of the registry value:
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeCCMC
<P><PRE>      \Parameters\Locale Date Format
</PRE><P>
   to match the date format of Windows NT.
<P>
   NOTE: The above registry value is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.
