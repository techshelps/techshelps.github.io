The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client version 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Client and Outlook users who use more than one
workstation can set up an offline storage file (OST) to share between
computers. The OST is usable from either system, but can only be used on
one computer at a time. This can be useful for the individual who works in
the office at a desktop system connected to the local area network (LAN)
intermittently, and also works from a laptop computer at a remote location
connected to an RAS server intermittently or not at all. The same OST file
can be used for both systems, which can prevent problems with
synchronization of sent or received items from either computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To set up an OST to share between computers, follow the steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the first computer, install the Exchange Client or Outlook Client.

<P><LI>Right click on the Inbox icon and select Properties.

<P><LI>Select Add to add a new profile for the client.

<P><LI>Follow the Exchange setup wizard to select the information services
   needed for this profile, and indicate the server where your account
   exists.

<P><LI>Select No for the option, "Do you travel with this computer," and finish
   creating the profile.

<P><LI>Next, select Properties, and highlight Microsoft Exchange Server.

<P><LI>Select Properties on the Advanced tab, and choose Offline folder
   settings. The settings will default to Exchange.ost for the offline file
   name. This may be changed as needed.

<P><LI>Click OK, and the new file will be created.

<P><LI>Open the Exchange or Outlook Client and select Tools.

<P><LI>Synchronize all folders from the Menu toolbar. You may also want to
<P><PRE>    Download the Offline Address Book at this time.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Exit and log off the client.

<P><LI>Copy the OST file that you created to the second computer, which will
<P><PRE>    be used remotely. Make sure that Exchange Client or Outlook Client is
    set up on this computer in the same manner as described above, with
    the Offline Storage File settings pointing to the OST file copied from
    the first computer.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Connect to the Exchange Server computer from the remote system
<P><PRE>    by opening the client and synchronizing one time. This will pass the
    security credentials of the individual's profile to the Exchange
    Server computer, allowing access to the OST on the second computer.
    This OST can be used in whatever manner an OST would normally be used.
</PRE>
<P><LI>From the second computer, synchronize the OST before moving it to the
<P><PRE>    first computer to ensure that the server copy of messages is current.
    Then from the first computer, the OST file can be copied to the
    system (overwriting the initial OST) and then opened and synchronized
    to send any messages or changes made to it.
</PRE><P>
</OL>Public folders are another popular feature with offline folder
users. Favorites from public folders can be synchronized while online,
and then used off-line in the same manner as the private folders. Using
this OST that has been copied from one computer to another will not affect
opening Favorites from public folders.
