The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Dynamic RAS Connector might fail to deliver mail
over NetBeui even though the modem connection is established and NetBeui
has been installed on both Microsoft Exchange Server computer's Windows NT
RAS configuration settings.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) only
supports the use of Microsoft TCP/IP, IPX/SPX compatible transport, and
Banyan Vines IP.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
To enable support for NetBeui over the Dynamic RAS Connector, the following
registry adjustment will need to be made on both Microsoft Exchange Server
computers.

<OL><P><LI>Start Regedt32.exe and open the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Exchange Provider
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the RPC_SVR_BINDING_ORDER registry entry add the following value:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NCACN_NB_NB
</PRE><P>
</OL>Make sure this setting is entered on both Microsoft Exchange Servers so
that they will have a common protocol. After the change is made, stop and
re-start the MSExchangeMTA service.
<P>
It is important to note that the MTA reads the RPC_SVR_BINDING_ORDER in a 
serial manner, so the placement of the protocols can effect how the MTA 
functions. If the NCACN_NB_NB value is first in the order, the MTA will 
attempt to use NetBeui first. If it is last, the MTA will read through 
all the other values sequentially. What this means is that if NetBeui and 
TCP/IP are both loaded, and the NCACN_NB_NB value is last in the binding 
order, TCP/IP will be used. This is only important in environments where 
there are mixed protocols and/or adapters.
<P>
CAUTION: Using only the NetBeui protocol with the Microsoft Exchange 
Dynamic RAS Connector may cause delays in modem disconnect times with 
certain modems and/or telco line conditions. This is due to a limitation 
in the NetBeui protocol. If such symptoms are encountered, we recommend 
that an additional protocol such as TCP/IP also be installed.
<P>
