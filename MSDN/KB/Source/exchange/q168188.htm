<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Move Mailbox command does not move mail from a renamed server-based
folder (that is, Inbox) to the new server, if a new folder with the
previous name of the renamed server-based folder (that is, Inbox) has been
created.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0.
<P>
A supported fix to this problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 
is in development, but has not been fully regression-tested and should be 
applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are 
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you 
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft 
Technical Support for more information on the availability of this fix.
<P>
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on 
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce the Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Rename any of the four default folders (Deleted Items, Inbox,
   Outbox, Sent Items). (For example, rename Inbox to Old Inbox.)

<P><LI>Create a new folder in the Mailbox folder with the same name as the
   original folder (for example, Inbox).

<P><LI>Place some mail in each of the two folders (for example, 3 in the
   renamed folder and 2 in the new folder).

<P><LI>Log off of the client.

<P><LI>Move the mailbox to another server within the site.
<P>
</OL><h3>Expected Results</h3>
 
<P>
Both renamed folder (Old Inbox) and newly created folder (Inbox) should
show up in the mailbox on the new server.
<P>
<P><h3>Actual Results</h3>
 
<P>
The new mailbox has a folder called Inbox, but no folder called Old Inbox.
Messages that were previously in Old Inbox (the renamed server-based
folder) will not be found in the new mailbox. Messages that were in the
newly created folder "Inbox" on the old server will be in the server-based
Inbox on the new server.
<P>
Properties of the private info store on the original server no longer show
the user that was moved. Properties of Priv IS on the new server show the
mailbox and its resources minus the number of messages that were in the
renamed folder. (For example, previously Old Inbox had three messages and
Inbox had two messages; after the move, Inbox will have two messages and
Old Inbox is not found on the new server. If Mailbox Resources had 51 items
before the move, it will have 48 after the move.)
<P>
This results in mail loss and the administrator must restore from the
backup to retrieve the messages for that user.
