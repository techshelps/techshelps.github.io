The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Site Addressing object in the Configuration hierarchy of a site and the
E-Mail Addresses page of recipient property pages are hidden in the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program when you install a Microsoft
Exchange Server using the default ("Typical") installation option.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you install the Enterprise Edition of Microsoft Exchange Server using
the default ("Typical") option of the Microsoft Exchange Setup program, you
will notice, when connecting to that Server later via the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator program, that the Site Addressing object does not
appear in the Configuration hierarchy of the Site to which the Server
belongs. In addition, the E-Mail Addresses page of the property pages for
recipients within the site is missing.
<P>
This behavior is by design. A default installation of Microsoft Exchange
Server, Enterprise Edition, does not install any connectors other than the
Site Connector. Given that the Site Connector is used strictly within an
organization and they should not be required for intersite communication
via Site Connectors, and that they can be created very rapidly and easily
via the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, the Site Addressing
object and the E-Mail Addresses page are hidden from view. However, if you
wish to modify site addressing or individual e-mail addresses for
recipients, this feature can present a problem.
<P>
If you have a need to access the Site Addressing object or the E-Mail
Addresses page within your Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, and
they are hidden because you have not installed any connectors other than
Site Connectors, you can force these details to appear using the Setup
program as follows:
<P>
<PRE>  1.  Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program on the Microsoft
      Exchange server on which the Site Addressing object is hidden.
  2.  Select Add/Remove from the Setup options.
  3.  Select Microsoft Exchange Server from the components listed in the
      subsequent dialog box, and click on the Change Options button.
  4.  Select any one of the three connectors listed (MS Mail, SMTP, or
      X.400), check the box next to the connector to add it to your
      installation, and click on OK.
  5.  Setup will install the selected connector and terminate immediately.
  6.  Start a fresh copy of the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program
      and connect to this Microsoft Exchange Server. The Site Addressing
      object will now be visible in the Configuration hierarchy.

</PRE>The above procedure does not stop services or otherwise interfere with
Microsoft Exchange server operation, and it requires no additional
resources. It can be performed at any time and completed within a few
seconds. Once at least one connector has been installed in this way, the
Site Addressing object and the E-Mail Addresses page will appear in the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program. It is not necessary to actually
create any new connectors within the site.
