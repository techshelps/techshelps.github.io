<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a form in Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer, you can copy
and paste fields on the form. In some cases it may appear that the field
has not been pasted, or the field may disappear after being pasted. This
will occur when an incorrect item is selected before you copy and/or paste.
<P>
When you copy fields in Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer, verify that the
entire field is selected before you copy the field. When you paste the
fields in Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer, verify that the correct
container is selected before you paste.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are several scenarios in which you would see the behavior described
above. Two common scenarios where pasting fields may seem to behave
incorrectly in Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer are listed below:
<P>
<P><h3>Scenario 1</h3>
 
<P>
Immediately after you drop a field onto the canvas and before you select
any other field, you copy and paste the field. Nothing appears to have been
pasted.
<P>
When a field is dropped onto the canvas, the caption is selected. If the
caption is selected when a Copy Command is performed, only the caption text
will be copied. If the caption is still selected when the Paste Command is
performed, the existing caption will be replaced with the copied text. It
will appear as if nothing happened.
<P>
To avoid this, verify that the entire field is selected and not just the
caption before you copy and paste.
<P>
<P><h3>Scenario 2</h3>
 
<P>
On a Tab Field, you correctly select an Entry Field and then copy and paste
the Entry Field without clicking another location on the Tab Field. You
will see the newly pasted Entry Field. Then if you click anywhere else on
the Tab Field, the pasted Entry Field will disappear. If you move the Tab
Field, you will see the Entry Field behind it. The Entry Field has been
pasted to the canvas instead of into the Tab Field.
<P>
If you select a non-valid container (Entry Field) before you paste, the new
field is pasted to the canvas and not the parent field (Tab Field) of that
non-valid container. The pasted field will appear until the parent field
(Tab Field) is re-selected. Once the parent field is re-selected, the
pasted field will no longer be visible. It is actually located on the
canvas behind the parent field.
<P>
To avoid having the Entry Field pasted to the canvas, select the Tab Field
or correct parent field before you paste the Entry Field.
