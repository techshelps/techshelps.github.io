<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has released Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. This 
article describes the new features that are included with this version of 
Microsoft Exchange Server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Scalability</h3>
 
<P>
The following scalability features are included:

<UL><LI>Unlimited message storage: The size of the public and private 
   information stores and the directory is limited only by the amount of 
   free space on your hard disk.

<LI>Deleted item recovery: Deleted objects are cached for a period of time 
   that you specify. While an object is in the cache, you can recover it. 
   Cached objects are not included in storage quota calculations.

<LI>Backup performance improvements: The application programming interface 
   (API) used during backups is improved. With the appropriate hardware, 
   you may be able to back up as much as 30 gigabytes (GB) of data per 
   hour.
<P>
</UL><h3>Internet Support</h3>
 
<P>
The following Internet-related features are included:

<UL><LI>Internet Message Access Protocol version 4 (IMAP4) support: This 
   allows IMAP clients to send and receive mail through a Microsoft 
   Exchange Server computer.

<LI>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) version 3 support: This 
   allows LDAP clients with the appropriate permissions to modify 
   directory objects. It also allows you to synchronize directories using 
   LDAP.

<LI>Internet security using Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions 
   (S/MIME) and X.509 version 3: Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 supports 
   the S/MIME and X.509 version 3 certificate standards. This allows you 
   to send encrypted messages over the Internet to anyone who is using an 
   e-mail client that supports S/MIME.

<LI>Additional Internet support: Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 supports 
   many other common Internet technologies, including Multipurpose 
   Internet Mail Extensions Hypertext Markup Language (MHTML), the ETRN 
   command, and bulk mailing headers.

<LI>Active Messaging enhancements: Including full calendar support for the 
   Web client and design time controls and wizards to make it easier to 
   develop solutions.
<P>
</UL><h3>Collaboration</h3>
 
<P>
The following collaboration features are included:

<UL><LI>Event scripting: Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 includes a server-based 
   scripting service that support JavaScript, VBScript, and most other 
   common scripting languages used to create collaboration programs.
<P>
</UL><h3>Multiple Organization Hosting</h3>
 
<P>
The following multiple organization hosting features are included:

<UL><LI>Virtual organization support: Administrators are able to create 
   virtual organizations by creating multiple address containers and 
   exposing them only to the users in that organization.
<P>
</UL><h3>Security</h3>
 
<P>
The following security features are included:

<UL><LI>Enhanced security management: Including a Key Management (KM) server 
   installation program that is integrated with the Microsoft Exchange 
   Server installation program, bulk enrollment of users and distribution 
   of certificates, and multiple password validation for administrators.
<P>
</UL><h3>Management</h3>
 
<P>
The following management features are included:

<UL><LI>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) support: Allows Performance 
   Monitor counters to be packaged with the Request for Comments (RFC) 
   1566 specification and used with an SNMP monitor.
