<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to access a public folder from Microsoft Exchange Client, the
client appears to stop responding for a while before it accesses the public
folder.
<P>
This normally occurs if the server containing a replica of the public
folder is unavailable. In that case, the client then tries to connect to
another server that contains a replica of the public folder.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0, the client slows down as described each
time the public folder in question is accessed (for example, each time you
open a message in the public folder). This is because the client tries to
connect to the initial server, even though it has previously tried to
connect to that server and failed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem does not occur in Exchange Server 5.0. The client keeps track
of which servers it has tried to connect to and failed and will not try to
connect to any of these servers to access public folders.
<P>
For example, say Server A and Server B are two servers in a site containing
replicas of a public folder, PF1. Consider the connection modulus for the
client computer causes the Exchange client to first try to connect to
Server A to access PF1. If Server A is down the first time public folder
PF1 is accessed, the client will wait while trying to connect to Server A.
After waiting for the timeout interval, the client will then connect to
Server B and be able to access the public folder. However after the first
attempt, every time the client tries to access the same public folder, PF1,
it will not try to connect to Server A but will directly go to Server B.
This information is only kept in memory and is lost when the client is
exited. Thus, the next time the client is started, it will again try to
connect to Server A.
<P>
For more information on the algorithm that is used to determine which
public folder replica is accessed when a user tries to open the contents of
a public folder, please refer to the following Knowledge Base article:
