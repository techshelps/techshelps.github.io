The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
While you are installing the service pack, a message appears stating that
the MAPI32.dll file is in use by another application and then gives you the
options to Abort, Retry, or Ignore.
<P>
If you choose Ignore, the Setup process completes with no other error
messages and gives you the message that the Setup completed. However, when
you start the directory, the clock will continue to turn.
<P>
In the Event Viewer Application Log, the most recent events are Event ID
11, "Database engine stopped", and Event ID 10, "Database engine started".
No other significant events are listed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem usually occurs with the Exchange services when the upgrade
encounters errors during the process, mainly when files involved in the
upgrade are in use. This prevents a graceful upgrade.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, make sure that ONLY the necessary services are
running in Control Panel/Services. Make sure all third-party programs are
stopped, including SNMP, backup software, e-mail clients, virus software,
Systems Management Server, and SQL Server.
After this is done, reapply the Exchange Server Service Pack; it should go
through cleanly. After it does, the Exchange services should start in
normal fashion, with a consistent database.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The only way to get out of this process is to "kill" it with Kill.exe.
Microsoft recommends not stopping any Microsoft Exchange process while it
may be writing information to the database, for this may lead to
inconsistencies in the database. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
before continuing.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The installation of new Service Packs should complete error-free; if not,
the actual messages or pop-up errors should be viewed as important and may
indicate an installation failure.
<P>
