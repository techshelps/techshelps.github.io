<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you upgrade from Windows NT Server 4.0 to Windows NT Service Pack 3,
Microsoft Exchange Server is unable to create an AppleTalk Mail Connector
Service. When you attempt to create the AppleTalk Mail Connector Service,
you will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The MS Mail Connector (AppleTalk) MTA service was not created because
   the counters for the Performance Monitor could not be installed.

</PRE>At this point, creation of the service fails.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows NT utility Lodctr.exe fails to look for Macgperf.h in the
same directory as the Macgperf.ini file. If this .h file is not found,
AppleTalk MTA service installation fails.
<P>
WORKAROUND
 
<P>
Copy the Macgperf.h file into a directory that is included in the system
path or into the same directory where Exchange Admin.exe is located
(\Exchsrvr\Bin).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Server
Service Pack 3. A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that
contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more
information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the Macgperf.h and Macgperf.ini files reside in the
\Exchsrvr\Connect\Msmcon\Bin directory. In previous versions of Windows NT,
Lodctr.exe searches for required files in the same directory as the
.ini file, the current directory, and the system path.
<P>
The Lodctr.exe included with Windows NT 4.0 SP3 only searches the current
directory and the system path for required files.
