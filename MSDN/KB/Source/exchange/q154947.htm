<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to move a Microsoft Exchange Public Folder from
one Microsoft Exchange Site, in which the public folder was created, to
another Site.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Public folders can be moved between Microsoft Exchange Servers in the same
Site by creating a replica on another Server in the Site and then removing
the original replica from the Server where the public folder was created.
<P>
However, this method cannot be used to move public folder between Sites.
You can replicate a public folder to a Server in another Site, but when you
try to remove the last replica of the public folder in the original Site,
the following error message will be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   You cannot remove all replicas of the folder from this site.
   Microsoft Exchange Administrator
   ID no:c1035e6a

</PRE>To move a public folder from one Site (SiteA) to another (SiteB), follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>From a Microsoft Exchange client logged in to a mailbox in SiteA, copy
   the public folder to a .PST file.
</OL>2. Delete the public folder in SiteA.
3. From another Microsoft Exchange client logged in to a mailbox that has a
<PRE>   Microsoft Exchange Public Folder Server in SiteB, copy the public folder
   from the .PST file to the Public Folder Store.

</PRE></OL>The public folder should now be re-created on a Public Folder Server in
SiteB.
