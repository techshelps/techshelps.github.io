<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you send a message that contains an attachment over a 1984 X.400
connection to a foreign message transfer agent (MTA) that uses Boldon
James manifest encoding, the attachment name may not appear in the message
when it is received. The attachment itself is transferred successfully,
but the attachment's name, date, and time are not. When you receive a
message over this connection, the attachment name may be changed to
Att.dat or a similar generic name.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By default, Microsoft Exchange Server does not create Boldon James
manifests for attachments. When you send a message that contains an
attachment over an X.400 connection that uses this type of encoding,
information about the attachment is not encoded into a manifest.
Therefore, the foreign MTA does not receive this information.
<P>
In addition, by default, Microsoft Exchange Server does not decode and
apply attachment information in Boldon James manifests when receiving
messages from foreign MTAs. As a result, attachment names may be changed
to generic names such as Att.dat.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is a design limitation of the 1984 X.400 specification that Boldon
James manifest encoding is designed to overcome. Although the creation and
decoding of manifests are not officially supported by the X.400
specification, Microsoft has enhanced the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0
MTA to support this feature.
<P>
This feature is included in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without
the spaces):

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The 1984 X.400 specification provides poor support for encoding attachment
information, resulting in multiple proprietary attachment encoding
schemes. Boldon James manifest encoding is a method of encoding
attachments in which an additional attachment, referred to as a manifest,
is included with the message. The manifest provides information about the
original attachment, including the attachment name.
