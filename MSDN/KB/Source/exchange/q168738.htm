<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If mail is sent from an Internet user to an X.400 Mail system through the
following path
<P>
<PRE>   Exchange IMC -&gt; Exchange -&gt; Exchange X.400 Connector

</PRE>the reply is returned as non-deliverable. In other words, you receive a non-
delivery report (NDR).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Because the recipient on the X.400 system is not in the Microsoft Exchange
Server global address list, the Internet Mail Connector (IMC) encapsulates
the recipient's address. This encapsulation is normally stripped by another
IMC later in the message path. However, in this particular scenario, there
is no other IMC. Thus, the Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent
(MTA) passes the encapsulation through as an additional Domain Defined
Attribute (DDA) attribute. On the reply, the IMC does not recognize the DDA
attribute, and returns the reply as non-deliverable.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Add the users on the receiving X.400 mail system to the global address
list.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. A supported fix is now available, but has not been
fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing
this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that
contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The X.400 Mail System recipient can look at details of the Internet message
for the sender and will see an additional DDA attribute of MSXENCAP:SMTP.
The DDA type is MSXENCAP and the DDA value is SMTP. This issue is resolved
by stripping off this DDA information. The recipient might also notice that
the NDR from the reply is generated from the IMC, and that details on the
To: line resolve to a correct SMTP address. This occurs because the IMC
uses the P2 header information in the NDR, but uses the P1 information to
actually try to process the message.
