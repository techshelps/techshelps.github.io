<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The performance problems of Microsoft Exchange 16-bit forms are not due to
client/server performance. They are due to loading large Visual Basic
runtime files off a disk, large forms executable files (200+ KB), and
working set issues for computers with less memory. This article gives some
suggestions on how you can increase form performance.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Forms must be downloaded locally from their respective source before they
can be run at all. This takes some time that you can note from the progress
bar indicating the forms installation. However, once the form is installed
and resides locally, the length of time for subsequent loadings of the form
may be increased.
<P>
On Windows NT Workstation 3.51, use the System Control Panel to set
foreground tasks=background tasks. For Windows NT Workstation 4.0, use the
Application Performance box on the Performance tab. If 16-bit applications
are not generally run, adding the Windows subsystem (Wowexec.exe) to the
Startup group may offer some performance benefits when loading the first
form after starting the computer.
<P>
For all platforms, you can increase the 2 MB default size of the Forms
cache. Depending on the size of the most recently used forms, doubling or
tripling the size of the cache generally gives improved form load
performance for the five most-used forms. You can do this from the
Microsoft Exchange client by clicking Options on the Tools menu, clicking
the Exchange Server tab, and changing the Maximum Space on Hard Disk
option.
