The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you upgrade to Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3
(SP3) from Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2),
you are unable to access the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program
either locally or remotely. You may experience the following symptoms:

<UL><LI>When you attempt to access the Exchange Administrator program, and you
   Select Browse, you receive the following message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Exchange Administrator
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         The list of Microsoft Exchange Server computers is not available
         because no Microsoft Exchange Server computer could be located.

      Microsoft Exchange Administrator
      ID no c10312c8

   When you manually type the name of the Exchange Server, you receive
   the error message:

      DS_E_COMMUNICATIONS_PROBLEM, connection to the Microsoft Exchange
      Server Computer could not be made

   -or-

</PRE><LI>When you use the Compaq NetFlex-3 network card, network connectivity to
   a computer is intermittently lost and then restored every few minutes
   without having to restart the system.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Depending on the application, the client or application may have to be
   restarted to restore the connection. If the application has open files
   on the server during this problem, data may be lost.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Some applications report the lost connections. Others applications may
   seem to stop responding (hang) for several minutes before continuing.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs because Windows NT Server does not detect the newest Compaq
NetFlex-3 adapter card during setup. The drivers for the newer cards have
the same name as the drivers for the old NetFlex-3 cards, and also work
with the old NetFlex-3 cards. Replacing the old NetFlex-3 drivers with the
new NetFlex-3 drivers in the I386\Drvlib.nic folder does not allow the new
drivers to be loaded for the old cards.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Compaq has supplied a new Ntoemdh.inf file that allows Windows NT to detect
and load the drivers for these new cards, and allows the new drivers to be
loaded for the older NetFlex-3 cards as well.
<P>
NOTE: For information on the latest versions of the adapter card drivers,
contact the manufacturer.
