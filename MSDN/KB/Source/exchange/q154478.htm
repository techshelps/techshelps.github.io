The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You may want to digitally sign an Eform for groupware and tracking
purposes. You cannot digitally sign an Eform using Visual Basic 4.0, but
you can have a RichEntry field on the Eform to which you can attach an
already digitally signed or encrypted message.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Make sure that you have enhanced security installed and running on your
   Exchange Server.

<P><LI>Have the user that wants to send a secure Eform create a message and
   digitally sign or encrypt the message and send it to their mailbox.

<P><LI>From the client Inbox folder select the encrypted message that was
   just received. On the File menu, select Save As and select Save File As
   Type. Select message format.  This will save the message as an .MSG
   file.

<P><LI>Start the EForms designer and create your form.  Make sure that there is
   a RichEntry field on the form. The RichEntry field should also have a
   reference name of MAPI_BODY_CUSTOM; this will allow you to add file
   attachments to this field.

<P><LI>Generate and install the form into the forms registry.

<P><LI>Launch the form from the client. Click the RichEntry field to
   highlight it.

<P><LI>Select Insert/File and select the .msg file that you saved earlier.
   The message should show up in the RichEntry field as an envelope icon.
<P>
<P>
</OL>You can send this Eform and the attached messages will be sent
along with it. You can also open and make changes to the attached
messages and then send the changed message on to another recipient.
<P>
The steps above allow for the full functionality of an encrypted or
digitally signed message, as long as the enhanced security is installed.
