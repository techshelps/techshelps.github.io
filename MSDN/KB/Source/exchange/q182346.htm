The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience one or more of the following symptoms:

<UL><LI>You may be unable to start the Internet Mail Connector (IMC) or the
   Internet Mail Service.

<LI>The Internet Mail Service may not be created when you run the Internet
   Mail Wizard from the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

<LI>The following event may appear in the event log:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Source: MSExchangeIMC
      Event: 4087
      Category: Initialization/Termination
      Description: The service could not be started because the queue
      viewing interface could not be registered.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur if a network service or network protocol is not
functioning properly. In particular, this problem may occur if you upgrade
from Microsoft Windows NT Server 3.51 to Windows NT Server 4.0 on a
computer on which Services for Macintosh is installed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the following steps. After performing each
step, attempt to start or create the IMC or Internet Mail Service again.

<OL><P><LI>If Services for Macintosh or the SNMP Service are installed, remove and
   reinstall them. If these network services are not installed, proceed to
   step 2. To remove and reinstall Services for Macintosh or the SNMP
   Service, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click Network.
<P>
   b. Click the Services tab, remove Services for Macintosh or the SNMP
<P><PRE>      Service, and then restart your computer when you are prompted to do
      so. If both services are installed, remove them both.
</PRE><P>
   c. In Control Panel, double-click Network.
<P>
   d. Click the Services tab, and then install the services you removed in
<P><PRE>      step B. If you have not applied a Windows NT Server Service Pack,
      restart the computer when you are prompted to do so.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      If you have applied a Windows NT Server Service Pack, do not restart
      the computer when you are prompted to do so. Reapply the Service
      Pack first, and then restart your computer.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove and reinstall each protocol that is currently installed. To do
   so, use the following steps.
<P>
   NOTE: You should only remove and reinstall one protocol at a time. If
   you remove all installed protocols at the same time, any folders that
   you shared in Windows NT are no longer shared. To cause the folders to
   be shared again, you must manually share them after reinstalling the
   protocols. If only one protocol is currently installed, you must remove
   and reinstall the protocol and then manually share the folders.
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click Network.
<P>
   b. Click the Protocol tab, remove a protocol, and then restart your
<P><PRE>      computer when you are prompted to do so.
</PRE><P>
   c. In Control Panel, double-click Network.
<P>
   d. Click the Protocol tab, and then install the protocol you removed in
<P><PRE>      step B. If you have not applied a Windows NT Server Service Pack,
      restart the computer when you are prompted to do so.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      If you have applied a Windows NT Server Service Pack, do not restart
      the computer when you are prompted to do so. Reapply the Service
      Pack first, and then restart your computer.
</PRE><P>
   e. Repeat steps A-D for each additional protocol that is currently
<P><PRE>      installed.
