<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains the repercussions of deleting public folder
replication messages from the MTA queues using the Exchange Administrator
program or the Mtacheck.exe utility with the /rp option.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve a backlogged MTA, it may be necessary to remove all
public folder replication messages in the MTA queues. When this is done,
the result may be the generation of even more public folder replication
messages, which may exacerbate the MTA problem.
<P>
During normal public folder replication, when a change is made to one of
the replicas of a public folder, the change is sent out to all the other
servers that have replicas of that public folder. This change is sent out
as a single mail message addressed to the public information store on each
server, in each of the other sites in the organization. The MTA is
responsible for routing this message to the correct destinations.
<P>
When public folder replication messages in the MTA queues are removed,
these regular public folder messages are not received by the destination
servers. Eventually, the other servers will generate backfill request
messages asking the server with the changes to send them the changes. These
changes are now individually sent to each server requesting a backfill, and
in turn, the number of public folder replication messages generated are
larger.
<P>
Consider a Microsoft Exchange organization with 20 sites with public folder
replicas on one server in each site. If a public folder on a server in Site
1 is modified, public folder replication messages are sent out to all other
servers in the other sites that contain a replica of this public folder.
<P>
Now, suppose the MTA on the bridgehead server in Site 1 is backlogged and
all the public folder replication messages in the MTA queues to the other
sites are removed. When this is done, the public folder replication
messages containing the changes to the public folder in Site never reach
the other sites. This causes the servers in the other sites to generate
Backfill request messages requesting these changes. In response to these
Backfill messages, another message is sent to each server requesting the
changes. This results in an individual message being sent to each
server in the other sites containing a replica of the public folder. As
a result, the MTA queues to the other sites will now have 19 new messages
instead of the one original message which was deleted from the queue. This
is in addition to the traffic generated by the Backfill messages from each
of the other servers.
<P>
In a large organization with several sites and several servers in each
site, the amount of additional traffic caused by public folder
backfill requests can be significant. Therefore, you should use caution
when you use the MTACHECK utility with the /rp option or delete public
folder replication messages.
