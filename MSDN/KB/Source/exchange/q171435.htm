The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
POP3 users are unable to log on to a Microsoft Exchange Server computer.
When the logon attempt fails, an event 11202 is logged in the application
event log.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the Microsoft Exchange Server service account does
not have the &lt;Act as part of the operating system&gt; Windows NT user right.
This only happens if the client tries to use basic (clear text)
authentication.
<P>
Below is an example of the type of event you will see in the Event Viewer:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 11202
   Source: MSExchangePOP3
   Type: Failure Audit
   Description: Logon attempt from to has failed: HrLookupCredentials()
   call failed with error: A required privilege is not held by the client.

</PRE>You can use telnet to verify that the Microsoft Exchange Server service
account is missing the &lt;Act as part of the operating system&gt; right. To test
this with telnet, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On Windows NT or Windows 95, open a command prompt.

<P><LI>At the command prompt, type &lt;telnet [name of computer running Microsoft
   Exchange Server] 110&gt;.
<P>
</OL>You will get a connection to the computer running Microsoft Exchange
Server. The server will issue a greeting banner that may appear as:
<PRE>    +OK Microsoft Exchange POP3 Server version 5.0.1457.10 ready

</PRE></OL>The sample telnet session below demonstrates how to verify that the
Microsoft Exchange Server computer is missing the required right. In this
sample, lines starting with S&gt; are sent by the server and lines starting
with C&gt; were sent by the client (telnet).
<P>
<PRE>   S&gt; +OK Microsoft Exchange POP3 Server version 5.0.1457.10 ready
   C&gt; USER &lt;userid&gt;
   S&gt; +OK
   C&gt; PASS &lt;password&gt;
   S&gt; -ERR A required privilege is not held by the client.

</PRE>If the Microsoft Exchange Server service account does not have the &lt;Act as
part of the operating system&gt; user right, an error will be returned after
the PASS command.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To grant the appropriate right to the Microsoft Exchange Server service
account, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start User Manager for Domains.

<P><LI>From the Policies menu, select User Rights.

<P><LI>Select the Show Advanced User Rights check box.

<P><LI>From the list of rights, select Act as part of the operating system.

<P><LI>Select Add.

<P><LI>Select the Show Users button.

<P><LI>Select the Exchange Server service account.

<P><LI>Click Add.

<P><LI>Click OK until you have completely exited all dialog boxes.
