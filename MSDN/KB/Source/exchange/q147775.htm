The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 Directory provides detailed
information about a Microsoft Exchange Organization's resources and
recipients. Replicating Directory information from one Microsoft Exchange
Server in a Microsoft Exchange Site to others throughout an Organization
guarantees every user that their data is current and accurate.
<P>
All Microsoft Exchange Servers must have the same Organization name in
order for Directory Replication to occur.
<P>
Before you set up a Microsoft Exchange Directory Replication Connector,
verify that there is a Microsoft Exchange message transport connector
between the two Sites. This message transport connector can be either a
Site Connector, an X.400 Connector, a Dynamic RAS Connector, or an Internet
Mail Connector (IMC).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If it is an X.400 Connector, a Dynamic RAS Connector or an IMC, the message
transport connector's Connected Sites property page should be checked to
ensure that Directory Replication can take place. The Site that the
Directory Replication Connector is connecting to should appear in the list.
<P>
It is possible to configure the message transport connector incorrectly. If
this is the case, the Directory Replication fails. Therefore, verify that
the message transport connector is actually working. You can do this by
composing a message and manually entering the X.400 address of a remote
Site recipient.
<P>
Directory Replication Connectors are not required to map on a one-to-one
basis with message transport connectors. As long as there is a message
transport path, a directory connector can be configured.
<P>
If an Organization has several Sites, you cannot have more than one
Directory Replication Connector path from one Site to another. In other
words, there can be more than one Directory Replication Connector in a
Site, but if you follow their paths, you cannot find a common Site. If the
Microsoft Exchange Server determines that you have attempted this, it
issues a message indicating that there are no remote sites available to
replicate. In some scenarios, the Directory Replication is configured so
quickly that this is not discovered by the Microsoft Exchange Server. In
this case, the Directory Replication fails.
<P>
For more information on Directory Replication, refer to Replicating and
Synchronizing Your System in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's
Guide.
