The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
SUMMARY
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client fails to connect to Microsoft
Exchange Server if the client computer is running only the Windows 95
client for NetWare Networks and the Microsoft Exchange Server-based
computer is running Windows NT File and Print Sharing for NetWare.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to work around this problem by installing DCOM95, which
provides secure remote procedure calls (RPCs) by means of an updated
Secur32.dll file. DCOM95 is available from:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/oledev/olemkt/oledcom/dcom95.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/oledev/olemkt/oledcom/dcom95.htm</A></B>

</PRE>If DCOM95 is installed, it is no longer necessary to install the Client for
Microsoft Networks to use the Microsoft Exchange Client with the Microsoft
Exchange Server service.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client requires secure RPCs to
communicate with a Microsoft Exchange Server. The Client for NetWare
Networks provided with Windows 95 does not support secure RPC.
<P>
To establish a session to a Microsoft Exchange Server from a Microsoft
Exchange Windows 95 client, the Client for Microsoft Networks will also
need to be installed. In addition, the option to log on to Windows NT
Domain as well as the domain name need to be enabled in properties of the
Client for Microsoft Networks.  This will in no way affect the performance
of the Windows 95 networking services nor impair its ability to communicate
with Windows NT FPNW and/or Novell NetWare servers on the network.
<P>
The order in which the network clients load will not affect the Microsoft
Exchange Windows 95 client's ability to communicate with Microsoft Exchange
Server either.
