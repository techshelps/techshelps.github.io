The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange clients might not see any Organizational forms
available from the Compose-New Form… option or when using the Manage...
command button on the Forms tab when viewing the properties of a folder.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If the Organization Forms folder for the Microsoft Exchange Site has been
deleted and then recreated, clients on other Microsoft Exchange Servers in
the Site will not be able to see the Organizational Forms until all
Servers have been rebooted.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Reboot all Microsoft Exchange Servers in the Microsoft Exchange Site and
any Server that might contain a replica of the Organizational Forms
folder.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Organizational Forms folder has a unique folder Entry ID (EID). When
this folder is created initially, this EID is cached by all Microsoft
Exchange Servers in the same Microsoft Exchange Site as well as all
Servers that contain a replica of the Organizational Forms folder. This
cached EID can be updated by stopping and restarting the Exchange services.  
In some cases it may require the Server to be rebooted. Therefore, if the
Organization Forms folder is deleted from the Server where it was
originally created and then a new Organizational Forms folder is created,
a new EID will be assigned to this folder. All Servers in the Site and all
Servers containing a replica of this folder will need to restart the Exchange
services or be rebooted to cache this new EID.
