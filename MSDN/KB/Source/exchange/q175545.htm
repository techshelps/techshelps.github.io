The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Five minutes after restarting the Microsoft Exchange Directory Service,
directory replication requests are sent to other Microsoft Exchange Sites.
The replication requests can be sent outside of scheduled times on the
Directory Replication connectors.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the Directory Service starts, it searches the Directory for objects
that have a property indicating that they should be synchronized at
startup. All naming contexts are created with this property set so the
Directory Service sends a request for updates at startup for each of them.
Since directory replication between Sites is messaging based, the Directory
Services waits five minutes for the Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer
Agent (MTA) to start before submitting the update requests.
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on
obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has added a new registry value to the Microsoft Exchange
Directory Service that allows a Microsoft Exchange administrator the option
of having the Directory Service ignore the synchronize at startup property
for naming contexts that are message based (this implies replication
requests to Sites). The Directory Service will still send synchronization
requests during the scheduled replication times as configured on the
Directory Replication Connectors.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
To enable this feature, perform the following steps after applying the new
files from Microsoft.

<OL><P><LI>Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>Go to the following key in the registry:
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
   \MSExchangeDS\Parameters

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Add Value and use the following entry (note the
   spaces carefully).
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: Replicator inter site sync at startup
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
<PRE></PRE>      Value:      0

</PRE><P><LI>Exit the Registry Editor and restart the Directory Service for the
   change to take effect.
<P>
</OL>Setting this value to 0 will prevent the Directory Service from sending
directory replication requests to other Sites at startup. To restore the
default behavior, either delete the registry value or set it to a value of
1 and restart the Directory Service.
