The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0 and 7.5
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Invited attendees, including resource accounts, are not sent a cancellation
notice when they are removed from the list of invited attendees for an
appointment.
<P>
For example, John invites Robin to a meeting in Conference Room 1.
<P>
John creates a new appointment and places Robin in the Required List and
places Conference Room 1 in the Resource List. Robin receives the meeting
request and accepts. The conference room is set up to automatically accept
all meeting requests and does so.
<P>
Later, John decides he would like to move the meeting to Conference Room 2
because he also wishes to invite his whole team.
<P>
John edits the appointment and adds the group, JohnsTeam, to the Required
List. He removes Conference Room 1 and adds Conference Room 2 to the
Resource List. The team members are sent a meeting invitation and so is the
resource Conference Room 2, which is also set up to automatically accept
all meeting requests.
<P>
The James decides that he would like to meet Marian on this same day but is
unable to find a meeting place. The only two conference rooms seem to be
booked; Conference Room 1 never received a cancellation message from John's
Schedule+ client.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Cancellation messages are not sent to individual users or resource accounts
when they are removed from the list of invitees of an appointment.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, you must cancel the entire appointment and
then create a new appointment with the new list of invitees and resources.
Canceling the appointment causes a cancellation message to be sent to all
invitees.
