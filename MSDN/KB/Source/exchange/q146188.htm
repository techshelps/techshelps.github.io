<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange client Use Network Security During Logon check box
does not always function as expected. This option might not allow a user
to access another user’s mailbox even though the proper NT credentials for
the other mailbox were entered. When this occurs, the user will receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The set of folders could not be opened.
   You do not have permission to log on.

</PRE>In addition, the user may be prompted to enter NT credentials even though
they have selected Use Network Security During Logon.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When named pipes is listed first in the binding order and the profile is
set to not use network security during logon, the Microsoft Exchange
client will prompt the user for NT credentials. However, it will not use
them to actually connect to the Microsoft Exchange Server and the user
will be denied access. If TCP/IP is listed first in the binding order, the
Microsoft Exchange client will always ask for the NT domain credentials
regardless of the setting for Use Network Security During Logon. In this
case, the entered NT domain credentials will be used and the user will be
allowed access.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : XCLN: Stopping Windows 3.x Clients from Prompting for a
               Domain

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design. If the user connects over raw IP or IPX there is no
current authenticated session and thus the user is prompted for NT
credentials. These credentials are then passed in on the RPC calls. The
user is only prompted for NT credentials when there are no authenticated
session already active. If the user is using Named Pipes, they are already
running within the context of an authenticated session and thus will never
be prompted for their NT credentials.
