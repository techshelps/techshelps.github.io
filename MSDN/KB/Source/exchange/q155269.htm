<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
This document contains some of the most commonly asked questions and
answers regarding Microsoft Exchange administration.
<P>
Q. Where is circular logging enabled or disabled?
A. To enable or disable circular logging on a Microsoft Exchange Server,
<PRE>   get Properties on the Server and select the Advanced tab. There are two
   check boxes for circular logging, one for the Directory and the other
   for the Information Store.

</PRE>Q. To enable or disable circular logging, do you need to restart the
<PRE>   server?
</PRE>A. The server will not need to be restarted. When this option is changed
<PRE>   from enabling or disabling circular logging, the DS will be stopped and
   started again, which will enable the logging option specified.

</PRE>Q. How do you back up the Microsoft Exchange Server from another computer?
A. Install the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program on the computer so
<PRE>   that backup is Microsoft Exchange-aware. Then you will need backup
   permissions on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer that you wish to
   back up.

</PRE>Q. Why would the Microsoft Exchange options be missing from the backup
<PRE>   utility?
</PRE>A. The Microsoft Exchange option is provided by the Ntbackup.exe that ships
<PRE>   with Microsoft Exchange. If Windows NT Service Pack 4 (SP4) is installed
   on a working Microsoft Exchange Server computer, the Ntbackup for SP4
   will be copied over and you will lose the Microsoft Exchange option. You
   can copy the Ntbackup.exe and Backup.hlp from the Microsoft Exchange
   Server compact disc to resolve the problem.

</PRE>Q. The Microsoft Exchange Administrator program is not showing the correct
<PRE>   message count or size in the store. Why does this happen?
</PRE>A. There is a latency issue when the Information Store (IS) is cleaned up.
<PRE>   If a message is deleted from a user’s mailbox, it may take until the
   next day for the IS to be updated and this will be reflected in the
   Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

</PRE>Q. What is the reason for lost messages on store after running Edbutil?
A. If there is corruption in the store, it is possible that you could lose
<PRE>   messages after running Edbutil /r for repair. If there is a page that is
   corrupt in EDB file, Edbutil will do the best job possible to fix it.
   You could lose one message or multiple messages, depending on the
   severity of the corruption. Edbutil /d will not cause this problem.

</PRE>Q. What are the capabilities of LoadSim?
A. LoadSim simulates any amount of users sending and receiving mail
<PRE>   messages on any number of Microsoft Exchange Servers. It can also create
   the users and folders for this purpose. This is useful for performance
   and load balance testing. For additional information, please see the
   Loadsim.doc on the Microsoft Exchange Server compact disc.

</PRE>Q. How do you change the Microsoft Exchange Service Account after Microsoft
<PRE>   Exchange has been installed?
</PRE>A. This is not recommended but is possible. The steps for servers in a
<PRE>   single site are listed below. Other factors come into play when
   connectors are involved. Development is working on those factors.

   1. Create a new service account and assign Log on as a Service and
      Backup Files and Directories permissions.

   2. In the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, change permissions
      on the Organization, Site, and Configuration containers.

   3. Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program in raw mode.

         a. View Raw Directory.

         b. Select Schema object on left-hand pane.

         c. On the File menu, select View Raw Properties.

         d. Double-click on NT-Security-Descriptor attribute.
.
         e. Double -click NT Security Descriptor.

         f. Add the new service account here. Make sure the role is Service
            Account Admin.

         g. Click OK, select Set, and click OK again.

         h. In Control Panel, open Services and change the service account
            on all the Microsoft Exchange services.

   NOTE: If the Microsoft Exchange Server is on an NTFS partition, Full
   Control permissions must be given to the new service account on the
   directory.

</PRE>Q. How do you get Books Online?
A. Books Online can be installed from the Microsoft Exchange Server compact
<PRE>   disc.

</PRE>Q. The Information Store gets error 1011 when starting. What does this
<PRE>   mean?
</PRE>A. Run ISINTEG - PATCH. For additional information, please see the
<PRE>   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCHANGE/Q149238.htm">Q149238</A></B>
      TITLE     : XADM: Information Store Fails to Start with -1011 Error

</PRE>Q. How can you configure the Microsoft Exchange Server for better
<PRE>   performance?
</PRE>A. Please see the Performance whitepaper located on:
<P>
<PRE>      <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/evalgd/upswpfnl.doc">http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/evalgd/upswpfnl.doc</A></B>

</PRE>Q. Can you merge two Microsoft Exchange Sites together?
A. Not without having to install new Microsoft Exchange Servers, exporting
<PRE>   users, and manually moving mail.

</PRE>Q. Why is SP4 required on the primary domain controller (PDC)?
A. SP4 is required for Novell clients to change their passwords.
<P>
Q. Can I send mail to a Public Folder?
A. Yes, you can send mail provided you know the e-mail address of the
<PRE>   Public Folder (PF). You might need to Unhide the public folder by
   unchecking the Hide from Address Book option on the Advanced page of the
   PF properties in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program. The PF
   should now be visible in the GAL and can be mailed to like any other
   mailbox.

</PRE>Q. How do I restrict users from creating top-level PFs?
A. From the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, choose Configuration,
<PRE>   Information Store Site Configuration Properties, Top Level Folder
   Creation.

</PRE>Q. How do you give another person Administrator rights?
A. From the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, add the user's
<PRE>   Windows NT account to the Permissions on the Organization, Site and
   Configuration containers.

</PRE>Q. How do you delete a PF?
A. Public Folders can be deleted from the Microsoft Exchange client.
<P>
Q. How do you run the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program from an
<PRE>   untrusted domain?
</PRE>A. Please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCHANGE/Q150880.htm">Q150880</A></B>
      TITLE     : XADM: Running Administrator From Untrusted NT Domain

</PRE>Q. How can users change their own mailbox details?
A. There is no built-in support to do this. The users will have to develop
<PRE>   a solution on their own. One possible solution is:

   1. Create a E-Form to allow the user to make changes.

   2. The E-Form should be mailed to a particular mailbox.

   3. Create a mailbox agent that monitors this mailbox.

   4. The mailbox agent runs BIMPORT or directly imports the data by
      calling DAPI functions. Details are available in the Exchange
      Developers Kit.

</PRE>Q. How do you rename the Microsoft Exchange Server computer name?
A. Note that this will only work if there is only one Microsoft Exchange
<PRE>   Server in the Site. This information can also be found in the Microsoft
   Exchange Resource Kit.

   Caution: When you rename a server you lose:
    - All connector/DXA configurations on the server.
    - All non-recipient configurations on the server.
    - All profiles for users that connect to the server.

   To rename the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server

    1. Disconnect all clients from the server.

    2. In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, select the
       Server name - Advanced tab.

    3. Under IS/DS Consistency Adjustment, select a method for adjusting
       inconsistencies. This step ensures that the information store is up-to-date.

    4. From the Tools menu, choose Directory Export.

    5. Ensure that the Assoc-NT-Account field has been exported. You use
       this file to restore the mailbox, distribution list, and customer
       recipient permissions.

    6. Quit all Microsoft Exchange Server services.

    7. Back up \dsadata\dir.edb.

    8. Back up \mdbdata\priv.edb and pub.edb.

    9. Run the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program, and choose Remove
       All.

   10. Restart your computer. and delete \exchsrvr.

   11. In the Main program group, double-click Control Panel.

   12. Double-click Server and then rename the server.

   13. Restart your computer.

   14. Run the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program. Choose the same
       organization and site names as before.

   15. Restart your computer.

   16. Quit all Microsoft Exchange Server services.

   17. Delete *.log from \dsadata and \mdbdata.

   18. Restore \mdbdata\priv.edb and pub.edb. If offline copy, run isinteg -patch.
       IMPORTANT: Do not restore the files from \dsadata.

   19. Restart the Microsoft Exchange Server services.

   20. Run the IS/DS Consistency Adjustment again on the private and public
       Information Stores. The consistency adjustment will re-create the
       directory without any permissions.

   21. Import the directory file created in step 4. Be sure to select
       Append in the Multi-Valued Properties box.

   Your server should now be running with the same mailboxes and Public
   Folders but it will have a new server name.
