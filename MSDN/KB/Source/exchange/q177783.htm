The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5
   on the following platforms: Alpha, PowerPC, x86
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Generating an Offline Address Book (OAB) on a drive that has low disk 
space will fail, leaving the drive with temp files related to this 
unsuccessful operation.
<P>
When you generate the OAB within the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
program, temporary files are created. Running this task on Microsoft
Windows NT Server causes these files to be created on the system drive of
the server or in the location to which the Administrator points the %temp%
and %tmp% environment variables.
<P>
If the directory service is large and low disk space conditions are
encountered on the server, an error may occur and you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   An error occurred while generating the offline Address Book. To view
   details, see the application event log in the Windows NT Event Viewer
   on the offline Address Book Server.

   Microsoft Exchange Administrator ID no. c1031662

</PRE>The following information is written in the application log in the Windows
NT Event Viewer:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID 5004 Generation of the offline Address Book is complete.
   Result: An error occurred.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The remaining temp files are not automatically deleted and must be deleted
manually. If temp files still remain, repeat the operation to complete. It
is commonly expected that temporary files associated with failed attempts
would be deleted, but in this case, they are not.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server 
version 5.5.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. 
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft 
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
