The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x prompts you for a Domain
Logon. If you don't want to be prompted for the Domain Logon, you can
prevent the Microsoft Exchange client from prompting for it.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x from prompting you
for a Domain Logon, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Check whether the Use Network Security During Logon option is selected.
   If this option is selected, you will log on to the computer running
   Microsoft Exchange Server using the same network security identity that
   you established when you logged on to your network. Select this option
   if your network logon identity gives you permission for your mailbox. If
   you clear this option, you will be prompted for your logon credentials
   when you start the Microsoft Exchange client. You can view the state of
   this option by doing the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a. Start the Microsoft Exchange client.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      b. On the Tools menu, click Services.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      c. Select the Microsoft Exchange Server service.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      d. Click the Properties button.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      e. Click the Advanced tab.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Check whether you have a password list (.pwl) file. In Windows for
   Workgroups, password caching is a feature that maintains a list of the
   passwords that you have used, and the resources to which they apply.
   Passwords are saved and retrieved transparently to you. The password
   cache enables the restoration of connections to shared resources when
   you log on. This file should exist in the Windows directory, and appear
   as Username.pwl. If it does exist, it may be corrupted. Create a new one
   by deleting the old file and restarting both Windows for Workgroups and
   the Microsoft Exchange client. This will create a new .pwl file, so you
   should test it again.

<P><LI>Check whether real-mode IPX/SPX is your only network protocol. Real-mode
   IPX/SPX does not support named pipes, and this support is needed to make
   authenticated remote procedure calls (RPCs). If this is your only
   protocol, you must use a .pwl file to eliminate the domain logon prompt.

<P><LI>Check whether any of your installed protocols support named pipes.
   Again, named pipe support is required for authenticated RPCs. If none of
   your protocols support named pipes, you must use a .pwl file.

<P><LI>Check whether named pipes is first in the binding order. When the
   Microsoft Exchange client is installed, it sets the default RPC binding
   order that determines the order of network protocols that RPC attempts
   to bind over. If named pipes is first, verify that the Rpc16c1.dll file
   is present on the computer, make sure that the computer running
   Microsoft Exchange Server supports named pipes, and test it using
   Rping.exe. For more information about the RPC Ping troubleshooting tool,
   please refer to the Microsoft Exchange Administrator's Guide. If named
   pipes is not first, you can change the order on this computer by editing
   the Exchng.ini file in the Windows directory. For future installations
   from a network installation point, a Microsoft Exchange administrator
   can use the Microsoft Exchange Setup Editor to change the default
   binding order.
