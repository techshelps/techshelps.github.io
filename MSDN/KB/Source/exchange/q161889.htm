<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides a quick reference for troubleshooting Microsoft
Exchange client offline folders (.ost files).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Definitions</h3>
 
<P>
OST - Offline Folder Storage - A file that contains a local replica of a
user's Microsoft Exchange Server-based folders (private and public) and
forms. The OST is synchronized with the Microsoft Exchange Server copy for
use while working offline. An OST is specific to a particular mailbox and
cannot be accessed by other users of Microsoft Exchange Server.
<P>
PST - Personal Folder Storage - A file that may contain folders, messages,
forms, files and other items. You can create any number of PSTs for use
with a single profile. You can also designate a PST as the delivery
location for incoming mail.
<P>
New Client Installation - If you are installing the Microsoft Exchange
client for the first time, during the profile creation you will be asked if
you travel with the computer. If you answer yes, an Offline Store provider
is set up for you and a file, Exchange.ost, is created. The OST is where
the offline folders will be stored.
<P>
Existing Client Installation - If this is an existing installation of the
Microsoft Exchange client, you can create an offline store using the
Offline Folder File Setting button in the Advanced tab of the Microsoft
Exchange Server driver property page. If multiple users will be using a
single computer, each user needs his or her own OST file.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating an OST</h3>
 
<P>
How to make a server-based folder available for offline use:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Open the folder property sheet by selecting the folder and clicking
      Properties on the File menu.

   2. Click the Synchronization tab and select Available Offline or Online.

</PRE>Once you make a folder available offline, you can easily synchronize that
folder by using the commands found under Synchronize in the Tools menu.
<P>
How to disable an OST:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Open the Mail Control Panel.

   2. Select the Microsoft Exchange Server service and click Properties.

   3. Click the Advanced tab, and then click Offline Folder Settings.

   4. Click Disable Offline Use. You may also want to rename the OST file
      on the local computer.

</PRE>How to compress an OST:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Open the Mail Control Panel.

   2. Select the Microsoft Exchange Server service and click Properties.

   3. Click the Advanced tab, and then click Offline Folder Settings.

   4. Click Compact Now.

</PRE>How to compress a PST:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Open the Mail Control Panel.

   2. Select the Personal Folders service and click the Properties button.

   3. Click the Compact Now button.

</PRE>When to use an OST or a PST:
<P>
An OST is the preferred method for offline storage, because it allows you
to use public folders and organizational forms while working offline.
Because an OST acts as a copy of Microsoft Exchange Server-based folders,
the data is backed up during the standard Microsoft Exchange Server backup
procedures. A local PST must be backed up by the individual owner. One
advantage a PST has is the ability to use the remote e-mail features of the
Microsoft Exchange client, download headers, move or copy messages, delete
unwanted messages before downloading, and read new messages while others
are downloading. When using an OST, the synchronization process is not
multi-threaded.
<P>
OST Sync Log:
<P>
During the OST synchronization process, a log file is kept, and it will be
placed in the Deleted Items folder at the completion of synchronization.
This log file is very useful in determining synchronization details and
errors. The following are some of the errors and possible causes:
<P>
8004010f - This error may be caused by any of the following reasons:

<UL><LI>You have changed the language of the Organization Forms registry after
   the OST was created.

<LI>You have two Microsoft Exchange Server sites, where the first has an
   Organization Forms registry and the second does not. Unless public
   folder affinity is set correctly, users in the second site will not be
   able to open the Organization Forms registry and will receive this
   error.

<LI>You added an Organization Forms registry, but it was later removed.
<P>
</UL>80030070 - This error is returned when there is no space left on the disk.
Free up hard disk space and try again. You may be trying to synchronize
some large attachments.
<P>
80040115 - A network error prevented successful completion of the
operation. Complete some basic remote procedure call (RPC) network
troubleshooting.
<P>
User's mailbox deleted from Microsoft Exchange Server:
<P>
Because an OST is stamped with a mailbox's unique ID, if a user's mailbox
is deleted and re-created on the computer running Microsoft Exchange
Server, the OST file will not synchronize with the new mailbox. The only
way to recover the data in the OST is to use the following steps exactly
before starting the client online:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Start the Microsoft Exchange client in offline mode, using the same
      profile that was used before with the OST.

   2. Add a PST to the profile.

   3. Copy the messages to the PST.

   4. Create a new profile that connects to the new mailbox.

   5. Move the messages from the PST to the new mailbox.
