<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes some tips for controlling public folders in a
Microsoft Exchange organization.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Design a public folder scheme for your organization. Decide how public
   folders will be used in your organization to organize data and how to
   facilitate easy access to the data in the public folders. For example,
   you may have public folders organized by geographical locations (North
   America, Europe, and so on), or by business units (Finance, Marketing,
   Development), or any other manner that works in your organization.

<P><LI>Once the fundamental public folder design is in place, create the top
   level public folders.

<P><LI>Control which users can create top level public folders. This allows the
   Microsoft Exchange administrator to control the basic structure of how
   information in the public folders is organized. The administrator can
   control which users can create top level public folders by using the
   Exchange Administrator program.
   
   Under the Site object, select Configuration and then get properties of
   the Information Store Site Configuration object. Go to the Top Level
   Folder Creation page.

<P><LI>The Exchange administrator can also control how the public folder
   hierarchy is displayed to individual users by setting the Client
   Permissions on the individual folders. Each public folder has a property
   called Folder Visible. If this permission is not granted to a user, then
   that user cannot view that public folder in the public folder hierarchy.
   For example, if all public folders under a folder called Finance should
   not be accessible to any users other than upper level managers, the
   default permissions on that public folder can be set with the Folder
   Visible permission revoked. The individual users or Distribution Lists
   of users who need access to the folders can then be granted rights to be
   able to view the Finance folder.
<P>
   5. Create replicas of public folders on different servers depending on how
   many users will need to access the public folders and the types of
   network links. For example, if a public folder is accessed by all users
   in your organization, it may be useful to add replicas of this folder to
   other servers and other sites. If the network links are sufficient,
   adding public folder affinity may also be an alternative to replicating
   folders.
