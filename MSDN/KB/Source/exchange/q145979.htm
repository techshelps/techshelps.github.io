The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to send a message that has file with no extension (.DOC,
.TXT, .XLS,...) attached to it, even if the host application is installed
in the system, the following error is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   The application associated with this attachment could not be started.
   Verify the application is installed on your system with a correct
   directory path. C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\&lt;filename&gt;.

</PRE>NOTE: On all client platforms, the attachment can be dragged into the Inbox
and viewed regardless of the presence of the extension. On the Windows 95
Microsoft Exchange client, the file can also be opened in the Explorer
window or the desktop.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a document is dragged to the Inbox and then opened, the OLE
specification calls for the application, such as Microsoft Exchange, to
look at an internal pointer within the file itself to determine which OLE
server application needs to be activated. However, when a file is placed in
a message as an attachment, there is no way to determine the internal OLE
identifier. A file extension such as .DOC would be required to have
Microsoft Word open the attached document.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
All documents that are made attachments in message must be given a file
extension. This is a default setting in most Microsoft Windows based
applications.
<P>
