The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to start the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service, the
following error occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   The Microsoft Exchange Information Store service returned
   service specific error 3355445011

</PRE>In the Windows NT Event Log, the following entry may be present:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 1080
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Type: Error
   Category: Recovery
   Description: Unable to recover the database because error 0xc8000713
   occurred after a restore operation. Unable to find the file.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The above error message occurs when the information store appears
to be restored from an online backup, but the information store
files are not restored because they are damaged or missing.
After a restore operation the Restore in Progress registry key is added
to the following key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS

</PRE>When the Information Store service starts and finds the above registry key,
it assumes a restoration has occurred and that the information store needs
to perform recovery steps. The information store then attempts to move
forward through any log files. Once the information store has successfully
started, this registry key is deleted. However, if the information store
cannot find the Priv.edb file or Pub.edb file, it cannot move forward
through the log files, and the above error message occurs. In this case,
the information store does not create blank EDB files, and the registry key
is not deleted.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
To resolve the problem above, delete the Restore in Progress key from the
Registry Editor in the following location:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS

</PRE>Start the information store again. If the required EDB files are not
found, they will be re-created. After this is done, try restoring from
backup again.
