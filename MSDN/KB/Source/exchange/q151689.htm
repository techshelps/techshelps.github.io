The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When starting the Microsoft Exchange Key Management Server (KM Server) the
following error is received.
<P>
<PRE>   The Microsoft Exchange Key Manager service returned service specific
   error 1"

</PRE>The Windows NT Event Log might have the following error message.
<P>
<PRE>   The Exchange KM service failed to start. Ensure that the KMSMSG.DLL and
   KMSERVER.EXE files have the same version and are in the same location
   and that you have provided the KM server password in the startup
   parameters in the services panel.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two main reasons why the above error message can be generated:

<OL><P><LI>The service account for KM Server is wrong or the password for the
   system account is wrong.

<P><LI>The password for the KM service startup parameters was not specified and
   the KM Server floppy is not accessible.
   The floppy disk might not be present because the option to create a KM
   Server floppy disk might not have been selected during installation of
   the KM Server
<P>
</OL>To correct this problem, verify that the system account for the Microsoft
Exchange Key Manager service is the same account being used by the
Microsoft Exchange Directory service.
<P>
This problem can also occur if, during the installation of the Microsoft
Exchange KM Server, an error was encountered writing the data to the floppy
drive.
<P>
The password for the Key Manager startup parameters must be entered every
time the KM service is started . This is the password that was received
during installation of the KM server. This password can be stored on a
floppy which is in the drive every time the KM server is started. This
floppy should have a file called Kmspwd.ini with the following information:
<P>
<PRE>   [config]
   pwd=&lt;14 character password&gt;

</PRE></OL>For example:
<P>
<PRE>   [config]
   pwd=ABCDEFGHIJKLMN
</PRE>
