<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The migration program stops responding (hangs) and creates a list of Event
Log error messages when it tries to migrate a Word Document from Collabra
to a Microsoft Exchange public folder. It always fails when the migration
program reaches a .doc attachment. The beta version of the same migration
program does not hang. It ignores all Word documents and therefore does not
try to migrate them.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Migration Wizard may hang while migrating Collabra Share forums with Word
attachments. If it doesn't hang, the attachment causes an error on import,
and is not migrated. Collabra treats Word attachments as regular
attachments, but uses a feature of the file format that is associated with
OLE presentation data. This data occurs where other attachment data is
expected.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
