The information in this article applies to:
Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a Microsoft Exchange user sends a message to a recipient in their
Personal Address Book (PAB), they not receive a Non-Delivery Report (NDR)
if the PAB entry is invalid. This problem will only occur in the following
circumstance:

<OL><P><LI>The message has been addressed to an Exchange user in another Microsoft
   Exchange Site whose address is in the originator's PAB. The PAB entry
   has become invalid either because they have been deleted from the system
   or their original Site no longer exists in the Microsoft Exchange
   Organization.
</OL>2. The connector that routes this message is a X.400 Connector configured
<PRE>   as 1984.
</PRE></OL>3. The connector does not have any Connected Sites information.
<P>
The message to the invalid PAB entry can be tracked by setting the X.400
Service category of the MSExchangeMTA to Maximum logging in the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator program. By looking for the 271 and 272 events in
the Windows NT Event Viewer Application log, you will see that the message
gets sent to the destination Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent
(MTA) successfully, a 271 event, then the resulting NDR from this system
is received OK, a 272 event, and finally the MTA then passes this on to
the Microsoft Exchange Information Store (IS), another 271 event. However,
the originator of the message does not receive the NDR.
<P>
If you turn on maximum logging for the Information Store (IS),
specifically:
<P>
<PRE>   MSExchangeISPriv/Transport Sending &amp; Transport Delivering
   MSExchangeISPriv/Transport/General/&lt;all categories&gt;

</PRE>you will see the following error in the Event Log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID : 2026
   Source : MS Exchange Private
   Type : Information
   Category : Transport
   Description : The delivery of a report failed due to error 00000BB8.
   The report has been deleted.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The MTA was not correctly handling Distinguished Name (DN) addresses. The
MTA now checks these before sending and will NDR the message back to the
originator with the following diagnostic information:
<P>
<PRE>   The recipient could not be transferred because it could not be
   downgraded.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The workaround for this is to use versions of the MTA greater than or equal
to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Exchange 4.0 : 996.56
   Exchange 5.0 : 1459.72
   Exchange 5.5 : 2110.00

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
<P>
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge 
Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE>Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
versions 4.0 and 5.5.
<P>
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
