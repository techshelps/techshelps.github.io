<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) text logs are binary representations
of communication among Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agents (MTAs) in
different Sites and between MTA and client applications within a Site. The
log includes the fully-encoded ASN.1 envelope. This is useful for verifying
when messages from remote MTAs are bad or invalidly formatted.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Increasing Diagnostic Logging levels to Medium or higher for both the MTA's
APDU and X.400 Service categories will generate BF*.LOG files in the
exchsrvr\MTADATA directory. The current log is always named BF0.LOG. Prior
logs are named BF#.LOG with the # increasing with the age of the log. When
a log reaches 5 megabytes in size it is renamed and a new log is begun.
<P>
NOTE: There is no difference between Medium and Maximum for the APDU
category. However, in addition to its influence on APDU logs, the
diagnostics logging level of the X.400 Service category determines which
X.400 events are written to event logs.
<P>
APDU logs can be instrumental in diagnosing problems with the MTA. However,
they are valuable only to those familiar with ASCII translations of X.400
protocol. These logs can grow quite large very quickly and cause
performance on the Server to suffer.
<P>
An ASN.1 Parser can be used to decode the data in a BF0.LOG.
<P>
If the logging levels of both X.400 Service and APDU are set to Minimum,
the first four events in the table below will be written to the Event Logs.
If the logging levels of both categories are set to Medium or greater, all
six events will be logged and the APDU text logs will be generated as well.
<P>
