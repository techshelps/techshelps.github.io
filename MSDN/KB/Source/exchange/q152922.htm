The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
SMTP addresses are not extracted when migrating MAC Mail personal
address list (PAL) entries to Microsoft Exchange Windows client personal
address book (PAB). The following is an example of what occurs with a
valid SMTP address:
<P>
<PRE>   entry,User 1,user1@company.com

</PRE>Note that the SMTP address type is not specified.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The extractor does not attempt to recognize SMTP addresses and tag them
as such.
<P>
STATUS
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Service Pack 2 is required to create a Windows PAB from the MAC PAL. It
is not possible to create an Exchange MAC PAB from a MAC PAL. For more
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   TITLE     : XADM: Unable to Migrate PABs for Appletalk Mail Users

</PRE>SMTP addresses are the only address types that are correctly migrated.
X.400, PC Mail, and Exchange addresses are not migrated although they
might appear to be after the migration. After you import the PAB (the
Migrate.pab file is created by running the Appletalk Mail Source
Extractor) into a Microsoft Exchange Windows client, the only names that
are valid are the ones with SMTP addresses. All other addresses will
give the following undeliverable message from the System Administrator:
<P>
<PRE>   No transport provider was available for delivery to this recipient.
