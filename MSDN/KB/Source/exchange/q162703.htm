The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to synchronize all folders from a client with an OST file,
the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Synchronization with the offline folder file could not be completed.
   Consult the synchronization log in the deleted items folder for details.

</PRE>Reviewing the synchronization log shows the following.
<P>
<PRE>   11:43:26 Synchronizing Organization Forms
   11:43:27 Error synchronizing folder
   11:43:27       [8004010F-501-0-521]
   11:43:27       The client operation failed.
   11:43:27       Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store
   11:43:27 Done

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error generally occurs when the organizational forms library that has
been created has been deleted and recreated after the OST has synchronized
the library. The internal object ID of the new Organizational Forms library
is different from the original; the offline folder store encounters
problems trying to synchronize because it (the offline folder store) has
the ID of the original.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve the problem:

<UL><LI>If the default permissions on the organizational forms library is set 
   to None, the client will fail to synchronize. However, with these 
   permissions, the synchronization log will contain:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Error synchronizing folder
      [80004005-501-0-540]
      The client operation failed
      Microsoft Exchange Information Store
</PRE><P>
   The default permissions for the organizational forms should be Reviewer
   in order to prevent the above error.

<LI>On all servers in the site that have mailboxes, verify that the Exchange
   Services were stopped and restarted after the new org forms library
   became a replica in the site.

<LI>On the client side, the org forms library will synch correctly on the
   second logon and synchronization of all folders.
<P>
</UL>Note: If the Organization Forms Folder has been deleted, you can recreate 
it using the Exchange Administrator program by clicking Forms Administrator 
on the Tools menu, and the clicking New.
<P>
This can also occur in a situation where the replica of the original
Organization forms library has been removed from the Public folder. As
long as the original Organizational forms library has not been deleted, a
replica can again be created in the site and the error message will
disappear after the folder has been successfully replicated.
