The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5
</UL> 
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Internet mail sent from an Exchange Server computer located in the New
Zealand time zone during Daylight Savings Time is received with an
incorrect time stamp outside this time zone.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
New Zealand Daylight Savings Time (NZDT) is not a defined time zone. NZDT
is actually +13 hours GMT. Time zone selections in Windows NT are
displayed in + or - GMT with a maximum of +/-12 hours GMT.
<P>
A new registry entry labeled "NewTimeZones" has been added to the
registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
Besides the hotfix mentioned above, the following key may be added as
necessary to allow for non-defined time zones:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS
   \ParametersSystem\InternetContent

</PRE>NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
readability.
<P>
This value MUST be defined as REG_MULTI_SZ type. You can define any number
of zone codes and associated time offsets. Each zone-offset string must be
in the following format:
<P>
<PRE>   ZZZZ;[+|-]hh:mm

</PRE>where ZZZZ is the zone code (can be any # of characters, terminated by a
<PRE>';'), hh is the hour offset (from GMT), and mm is the minute offset (from
</PRE>GMT).
