The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the Properties command on the Exchange menu in User Manager for
Domains to modify the properties of a mailbox, and then attempt to perform
a directory import from the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, you
may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to initialize because Windows reports error 1815.

</PRE>After the error message is displayed, the directory import is not
performed. This problem is known to occur when you run the U.S. version of
Microsoft Exchange Server on a computer that is running a double-byte
character set (DBCS) version of Microsoft Windows NT Server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you modify the properties for a mailbox from User Manager for Domains,
the default Microsoft Exchange language ID is initialized. The language ID
should be obtained from the User Manager for Domains add-on that is
installed with Microsoft Exchange Server (Mailumx.dll), but may be obtained
from User Manager for Domains instead. If you are running the U.S. version
of Microsoft Exchange Server and a DBCS version of Windows NT Server, this
may cause the language ID to be initialized incorrectly. When this occurs,
you are unable to perform directory imports from the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
To work around this problem, verify that the default Microsoft Exchange
language ID is correct before you perform the directory import. To do so,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe as appropriate for
   your version of Windows NT).

<P><LI>Locate the following key in the registry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\MSExchangeAdminCommon
</PRE>
<P><LI>Verify that the following value exists under this registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: AdminLangID
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
<PRE></PRE>      Value:      0x009 (hexidecimal)

   If this registry value is not assigned a value of 0x009, modify the
   registry value and assign it this value. Note that this value is only
   appropriate if you are using the U.S. version of Microsoft Exchange
   Server.

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>

version 5.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server
