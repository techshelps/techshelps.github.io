<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains some of the frequently asked questions by Microsoft
Exchange Windows clients.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. How do I know where my Personal Folders are located and what the
      file names are?

   A. In the Microsoft Exchange client, click Tools, click Services,
      click on any of the services (Microsoft Exchange Server, Personal
      Address Book, Personal Folder, and so forth), then click Properties
      and information about the selected service will be displayed. In
      this case, you will click on the Personal Address Book service.

2. Q. I am not receiving any mail.

   A. Each service contains an Inbox. Check to be sure you are looking at
      the Inbox where your new mail is being delivered.

3. Q. I think I have lost all my folders. All I see are messages that
      were in my Inbox and my E-Mail folder structure is not visible on
      the left side of the screen.

   A. You might have accidentally hidden your folder list by pressing the
      second icon on the Toolbar, the show/hide folder list icon, or
      unchecked View, Folders from the menu. Try clicking the show/hide
      folder list icon or check on Folders under View.

4. Q. How do I know which Inbox my new mail is being delivered to?

   A. In the Microsoft Exchange client, click Tools, click Options, click
      on the tab marked Delivery. The location shown on the line that
      says "Deliver new mail to the following location" is where all new
      mail will be delivered to. If you change the delivery location, all
      mail in the Server Inbox will automatically be transferred to the
      new delivery location.

5. Q. When composing mail to an Alias and hitting Ctrl+K to resolve the
      alias to a friendly name, Microsoft Exchange is resolving the
      alias to an incorrect name.
   A. This is caused by an outdated or bad entry in your personal address
      book. Chose the appropriate fix below:
      1. Set Microsoft Exchange to first resolve names from the address
         books on the Microsoft Exchange Server instead of your personal
         address books. In Microsoft Exchange, click on Tools, click on
         Options, click on Addressing, find the portion of the screen that
         says "When sending mail, check names using these address lists in
         the following order", highlight the entry "Global Address List"
         and move it to the top of the list by clicking on the UP arrow,
         click Apply, click OK.

      2. If you have entries in your personal address book that you do not
         want to delete, in the Microsoft Exchange client: click on Tools,
         click on Address Book, in the "Show Names from the:" box, click on
         the down arrow to get the drop down list, scroll(usually all the
         way UP or all the way DOWN) in the list and click on Personal
         Address Book, scroll down through the list until you see the entry
         that you are having trouble with, right click on it and select
         delete.

      3. If you do not need any of the entries in your Personal Address
         Book, you can delete and recreate your .PAB file as follows: Exit
         and LogOff of the Microsoft Exchange client, search your local
         hard drive for the MAILBOX.PAB file, rename all of the .PAB files
         that are found (usually one), and re-start the Microsoft Exchange
         client. When it starts, you will get a message indicating that the
         Personal Address Book could not be opened and you will be asked if
         you want to use a different Personal Address Book, click YES and
         at the next screen that appears, click OK.

6. Q. When I compose Mail, I currently click on Tools-Check Names or
      use Ctrl+K to check names. Isn't there a more convenient way to
      do this?

   A. Yes. When composing mail, click on View and click on Toolbar. This
      activates the toolbar. Once the toolbar is activated, each time you
      compose mail the toolbar will be visible. In the center of the
      toolbar you will see a button with a person with a red check mark.
      Click on this button to check names or resolve aliases.

7. Q. I cannot receive or send mail and my Outbox is red.

   A. If there is a backlog of mail to and from Microsoft Exchange
      Servers, or if the Messaging Transfer Agent (MTA) on your Microsoft
      Exchange Server is stopped, you will notice that your Outbox will
      be red. While your Outbox is red, you will be unable to send or
      receive mail.

8. Q. When I first start Microsoft Exchange, I get an error "A set of
      folders could not be opened. You do not have permission to log
      on."

   A. Only the owner of the mail files on the Microsoft Exchange Server
      has access to those files. Be sure that you are logging on to the
      computer with your own E-mail name, that you are being properly
      validated onto the domain when you log onto the network, and that
      Microsoft Exchange is using your own Profile. Try deleting and
      re-creating your MircrosoftExchange Profile. If this does not help
      then contact Microsoft Product Support Services for help.
