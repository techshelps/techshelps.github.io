The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Windows Remote client may display the 
following message when you attempt to open an attachment that you 
received by being a member of an Exchange Server Distribution List (DL):
<P>
<PRE>   The Attached file &lt;filename&gt; could not be opened because a temporary
   file could not be created.

</PRE>This occurs when the message contains a large number of recipients and
the recipient data exceeds 32K bytes.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A logic error in the remote mail client caused the attachment to fail
to be renamed. This prevents it from being downloaded to the MMF file.
The reference to the attachment exists in the message, but the actual 
attachment has been lost. When you attempt to use the attachment, the 
error message is displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail Windows
Remote Client. A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully 
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing 
this specific problem. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for 
more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It may be possible to work around this problem by creating DLs that 
consist of groups created by the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks 
administrators. These group names are not expanded and can be distrubuted 
to other postoffices and included in a larger group.
<P>
If the large DL is created in Exchange Server, it may be possible to
create the DL using smaller DLs and nesting these into the main DL.
