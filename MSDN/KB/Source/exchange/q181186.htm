The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Messages are not delivered or received across the Microsoft Server
Connector for Lotus CC-Mail (CCMC). There may not be any errors in the
application event log.
<P>
If a message is sent to the Lotus cc:Mail environment, with Maximum logging
level set for the categories Outbound and General, the only Event ID logged
is:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 11001
   The following message was sent from Microsoft Exchange to Lotus cc:Mail,
   From: USER at EXCHANGESITE
   Date: 2/10/98 11:28
   To: CCMailPO1 User1 at CCMAILPO1

</PRE>Normally, Event ID 11001 is followed by Event ID 67 and/or 58 (examples
below):
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 58
   Lotus cc:Mail IMPORT from file *.ccm completed successfully.

   Event ID: 67
   Lotus cc:Mail EXPORT to file msg65F9.ccm completed successfully.

</PRE>If a directory synchronization (dirsync) interval occurs, the only
application Event ID is:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 14001
   Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail directory synchronization
   has started.
   Now exporting Lotus cc:Mail directory entries, mailing lists, and
   bulletin board titles.

</PRE>Normally, at the normal conclusion of the dirsync process, an Event ID
14031 is logged:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 14031
   Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail directory synchronization
   has finished.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server was installed in a directory that exceeds eight
characters in length (for example, C:\ExchSrvr55). When the Microsoft CCMC
is configured to use the MS-DOS based Import.exe and Export.exe utilities
(provided by Lotus cc:Mail), these utilities fail to operate if they are
provided a path that exceeds the MS-DOS 8.3 naming convention.
<P>
Exchange Server provides the path to the Export.ini file (for example,
C:\ExchSrvr55\CCMCData\Export.ini) and the MS-DOS utilities fail to locate
the INI file necessary for normal operation.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Install Exchange Server to a directory that does not exceed eight
characters in length.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version
5.5.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With the fix applied, the CCMC only passes short-path names to the Lotus
cc:Mail export/import utilities.
<P>
Lotus cc:Mail is manufactured by Lotus, a vendor independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
