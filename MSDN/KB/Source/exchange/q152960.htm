<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides the steps necessary to create new Site Folders in a
Site. Because the folders are re-created, the data contained in the
original Site Folders is lost.
<P>
It may be necessary to rebuild the Site Folders (that is, the Offline
Address Book, Schedule+ Free Busy Information and Organizational Forms) if
the first server in the site is removed without following the
procedures in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCHANGE/Q152959.htm">Q152959</A></B>
   TITLE     : Procedures for Removing the First Server in a Site

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Below are the steps to rebuild the Site Folder in your Microsoft Exchange
Site; after the steps there is some information on repopulating the site
folders with data.
<P>
To rebuild the Site Folder:

<OL><P><LI>Obtain a copy of the utility Guidgen.exe. This utility is available in
    the Microsoft Developers Network under the product samples. If you do
    not have access to this utility, Contact Microsoft Product Support
    Services. The GUIDGEN utility will randomly generate a globally unique
    identifier (UID) that will be used to rebuild the site folders.

<P><LI>Run GUIDGEN and select Option 4, Registry Format.

<P><LI>Click New GUID.

<P><LI>Copy or write down the new GUID number from the RESULT box. This number
    will be needed in Step 10.

<P><LI>Run the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program in "raw" mode. To do
    this, go to the command line, change to the Exchsrvr\Bin directory, and
    type "admin /r".

<P><LI>Select the Configuration container of the Site you want to rebuild and
    highlight the Information Store Site Configuration object.

<P><LI>Select File, Raw Properties.

<P><LI>In the Object Attributes window, scroll down to the Site Folder GUID
    attribute and select it.

<P><LI>Click Editor.

<P><LI>Replace the existing GUID number with the one generated in Step 2 (the
    value should be entered in hexadecimal) and then click OK.

<P><LI>Press the SET button. After doing this, make sure the Edit Value
    and Attribute Value are the same.

<P><LI>Click OK to close the dialog box.

<P><LI>Stop and restart the Information Store service with the Services icon 
    in Control Panel.
<P>
<P>
</OL>Repopulating the Site Folders with Data
 
<P>
<P><h3>Offline Address Book</h3>
 
<P>
To repopulate the offline address book Site Folder:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

<P><LI>Select the Configuration container and get the Properties on the DS
   Site Configuration object.

<P><LI>Click the Offline Address Book tab and click Generate Offline Address
   Book Now.
<P>
</OL><h3>Schedule+ Free Busy Information</h3>
 
<P>
The Schedule+ Free Busy Information site folder will be repopulated as
users log on to Schedule+ and generate changes. During this period some
users' Free Busy information will be temporarily unavailable.
<P>
<P><h3>Organizational Forms</h3>
 
<P>
If there was an Organizational Forms Site Folder, it must be re-created
using the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

<OL><P><LI>Run the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

<P><LI>Click Tools, click Forms Administrator and click New.
<P>
</OL>Any forms that existed before the first server was removed must be re-
installed into the Organizational Forms folder. Re-creating the
Organizational Forms folder can have adverse affects on the other servers
in the site. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCHANGE/Q152958.htm">Q152958</A></B>
   TITLE     : XADM: Organizational Forms Unavailable to Other Servers in
               Site

</PRE></OL>NOTE: The server you are connected to through the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program (that is, the server that appears in bold type under
the Servers container) will become the new home of the Site Folders after
the above steps are completed.
