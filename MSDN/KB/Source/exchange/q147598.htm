The Information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Microsoft Exchange MS Mail Connector and a related
Microsoft Exchange PC MTA service, you may receive one of the following
errors in the application event log on the Microsoft Exchange Server
computer.
<P>
<PRE>   PC MTA is unable to dynamically connect to MS MAIL.
   Ensure the path and password are correct.

</PRE>or
<P>
<PRE>   The MS Mail data files could not be found a the specified
   connection. A connection to this server could not be
   established or access was denied.

</PRE>If this occurs, you need to verify that nothing has changed in the
configuration of the Microsoft Exchange MS Mail Connector. In other words,
the postoffice could have been moved, phone number changed, and so forth.
<P>
This article contains general information as well as information on
verifying the setup for the following configurations:

<UL><LI>For a LAN connected Postoffice.
<LI>For an Async connected Postoffice.
<LI>For an X.25 connected Postoffice.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
General:

<UL><LI>Verify the postoffice is still shared with the proper name.
<LI>Verify no share passwords have changed.
<LI>Verify proper access permissions to the share.
<P>
</UL>For a LAN connected Postoffice:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Properties page for the MS Mail Connector.
</OL>2. Select the 'Connector MTAs' tab.
3. Select the '..MTA Services' service that is having problems.
<P>
Verify that there are postoffices listed under the 'Postoffices Serviced'
option. If there are none, select &lt;Add&gt; to create new Postoffices to be
serviced.

<OL><P><LI>Select the Postoffices listed under 'Postoffices Serviced'
</OL>5. Select &lt;Edit&gt;
<P>
Verify that the 'Postoffice Path:' is a UNC path that points to the
postoffice's MAILDATA directory that will have 19 subdirectories of data
files.
<P>
Verify that the Account Name is a valid Windows NT account that has full
access rights to the postoffice data files and that the password supplied
is valid. You only need a logon ID if the MS Mail postoffice is in a non-
trusted domain or if the Windows NT service account is not a valid user on
the Windows NT Server where the postoffice exists.
<P>
To test the account, password, and the path:

<OL><P><LI>Log onto the domain with the username and password.
</OL>2. Map a drive to the postoffice path of the MS Mail Postoffice.
3. Verify that you can read, write, create, and delete a file.
4. Verify that you can see the 19 subdirectories.
<P>
NOTE: Before attempting to connect to a Novell Netware server, your Windows
NT Server must be running the Gateway Service for Netware. Also, verify
that the account used to login has the proper rights (RWCEMF) on the
MAILDATA volume and the account is a supervisor equivalent. When typing a
network path to a Novell Netware server, use the uniform mapping convention
(UNC format: Servername\Sharename\Path for a Windows NT Server or
Servername\Volumename\Path for Novell Netware server). For example, an MS
Mail Postoffice located on a Novell Netware server with the server name
SERVER1, volume name SYS, and directory name MAILDATA would require the
network path Server1\Sys\Maildata.
<P>
For an Async connected Postoffice:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Properties page for the MS Mail Connector.
</OL>2. Select the 'Connections' tab.
3. Select each the postoffice being connected to via ASYNC.
<P>
Verify that the Sign-ON ID is the serial number identifier for the
postoffice and that the Password is correct for logging onto the MS Mail
Postoffice. Use the Config-Password menu in the PC Mail Administrator
program (Admin.exe) to see the network, postoffice name, serial number and
password.
<P>
NOTE: If the serial number begins with 799, see note below.
<P>
Also verify that the phone number is the phone number of the MS Mail
External program (External.Exe) that distributes the messages at the remote
MS Mail Postoffice.

<OL><P><LI>Select the 'Connector MTAs' tab.
</OL>5. Highlight the service failing under the '...MTA Services' option.
6. Select Configure.
<P>
Verify the COM port and the Modem script are correct.
<P>
NOTE: If the MS Mail Postoffice is a Workgroup Postoffice (created with
Windows for Workgroups or Windows NT), it must be upgraded to a full
version of MS Mail. You can tell if it is a Workgroup Postoffice if the
serial number begins with 799.
<P>
For an X25 connected Postoffice:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Properties page for the MS Mail Connector.
</OL>2. Select the 'Connections' tab.
3. Select each the postoffice being connected to via X.25.
<P>
Verify that the Sign-ON ID is the serial number identifier for the
postoffice and the Password is correct for logging onto the MS Mail
Postoffice. Use the Config-Password menu in the PC Mail Administrator
program (Admin.exe) to see the network, postoffice name, serial number and
password.
<P>
NOTE: If the serial no begins with 799, see note below.
<P>
Also, verify that the X.121 address is for the MS Mail External program
that distributes the messages at the remote MS Mail Postoffice.

<OL><P><LI>Select the 'Connector MTAs' tab.
</OL>5. Highlight the service failing under the '...MTA Services' option.
6. Select Configure.
<P>
Verify that the X.121 Address is the location of this Connector's MTA
instance. Verify that the Port number is the X.25 adapter port number (see
the X.25 adapter documentation). Verify that the X.25 Listen User data is
set to what your X.25 service provider provided. And finally, verify that
the X.25 Listen User Facilities is set to what was specified by the X.25
service provider.
<P>
NOTE: If the Ms Mail Postoffice is a Workgroup Postoffice (created with
Windows for Workgroups or Windows NT) it must be upgraded to a full version
of Microsoft Mail. You can tell if it is a Workgroup Postoffice if the
serial number begins with 799.
