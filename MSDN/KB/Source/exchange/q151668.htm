The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
When attempting to create a New Dirsync Requestor object on an Exchange
Server, the administrator receives the following error:
<P>
"An error occurred while processing an e-mail address.  To view details of
the error, see the application event log in the Windows NT Event Viewer on
the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Administrator ID No: c1030b35"
<P>
This error indicates that more information can be found in the Event
Viewer; however, the application log in Event Viewer reveals no information
related to this error.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
There is already a Hidden Recipient, $SYSTEM, in the Directory that
corresponds to the Dirsync Server that has been selected.  For instance,
when a New Dirsync Requestor object is created, the administrator is asked
to specify the Dirsync Server (must choose "Non MSMail Dirsync Server" or
the correct MS Mail PO from a list).  If the administrator chooses the MS
Mail PO called "NETWORK1/PO1" from the list, completes the configuration,
accepts the default for Dirsync Address on the General tab,  and clicks
"OK", then the error above will occur if there is already a Hidden
Recipient with a Directory Name of MS:Network1/PO1/$System in the Directory
on that Exchange Server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
These Hidden Recipients may be viewed by selecting the Recipients container
and then clicking on View-Hidden Recipients.  The Hidden Recipient can be
deleted, and the error should no longer occur.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
There are a couple of scenarios where this error is known to occur:
<P>
1)    If a Dirsync Requestor object pointing to the same Dirsync Server had
already been added and then deleted on this Exchange Server, or
2)    If the PO that has been specified as the Dirsync Server has already
been specified as a Requestor in the organization.  In other words, if a
Remote Requestor object has already been created on an Exchange Server that
has a DXA Server object, then a $SYSTEM Hidden Recipient would already
exist.  Note:  This is not a valid configuration, since there should only
be a single Exchange Server in the Organization with either a DXA Server or
Dirsync Requestor object.
