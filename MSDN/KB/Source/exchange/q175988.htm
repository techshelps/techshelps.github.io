<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you use Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 and want to run IMAP clients
against an Exchange Server computer, you need to be aware that not all IMAP
clients are alike.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 is IMAP4 Rev 1 compliant, which is covered by
RFC 2060. IMAP comprises over 30 commands, through which messages can be
searched, fetched, and expunged from the Exchange Server computer. IMAP is
well suited for online and offline use. IMAP can connect to multiple
mailboxes (providing permissions are in place) and public folders, and can
be used for non email purposes, such as news services.
<P>
IMAP is powerful and flexible. Microsoft and the many other makers of IMAP
clients showcase IMAP functionality in different ways. For example, some
clients do not have a folder view and some do. Some clients show all
folders associated with the mailbox account and others require the user to
subscribe to them. Users that run multiple IMAP clients may not find
consistent results across every client they use. As a result, users and
administrators may look to the Exchange Server computer as the source of
some IMAP client problems.
<P>
Microsoft has tested over a dozen IMAP clients since it committed to IMAP
protocol support for Exchange Server 5.5, and testing continues. When
Microsoft sees client behavior that may be interpreted as server trouble,
that information is posted in the Microsoft Knowledge Base. A number of
articles already exist, and more will be added as the product matures.
<P>
Exchange Server 5.5 is IMAP neutral, and it accepts and responds to IMAP
commands assembled by the client. Though the clients use a common
framework (RFC 2060), not all clients work the same. When performance
questions arise, administrators can activate detailed IMAP
protocol logging, and they can view the IMAP conversation. For more
information on this issue, see <B><A HREF="../URJump.htm">Q169538</A></B>, "Activating Protocol Logging for
POP3 and IMAP4," in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
