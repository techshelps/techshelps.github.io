The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you attempt to send a message to an Internet recipient when you are not
connected to a Microsoft Exchange Server computer, you may receive a non-
delivery report (NDR) similar to the following when you connect to the
server:
<P>
<PRE>   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

      Subject: &lt;subject&gt;
      Sent: 7/19/96 11:20:50 AM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

      &lt;recipient&gt; on 7/19/96 11:20:52 AM

      No transport provider was available for delivery to this recipient.

</PRE>This problem occurs with Internet recipients that are not located in your
personal address book (PAB) or the global address list. The problem can
occur when you are using offline folders and an offline storage file (OST)
or the remote features of your e-mail client and a set of personal folders
(.pst file). Note that creating a new OST or a new profile does not resolve
the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Configure the Microsoft Exchange Server information service to connect
   through a network instead of working offline. To do so, follow these
   steps:
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click Mail.
<P>
   b. Click Microsoft Exchange Server in the list of information services,
<P><PRE>      and then click Properties.
</PRE><P>
   c. In the When Starting area, click the Connect With The Network
<P><PRE>      option to select it, click OK, and then click OK again.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Verify that your computer is physically connected to the network. If
   you cannot physically connect your computer to the network, connect to
   the network using Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Start your e-mail client, send a message to an Internet recipient, and
   then verify that you do not receive an NDR. Do not continue with these
   steps if you receive an NDR when you attempt to send a message to an
   Internet recipient while you are connected to the Microsoft Exchange
   Server computer.

<P><LI>Quit and log off the e-mail client. If you connected to the network
   using Dial-Up Networking, end the Dial-Up Networking connection.

<P><LI>Configure the Microsoft Exchange Server information service to work
   offline instead of connecting through the network. To do so, follow
   these steps:
<P>
   a. In Control Panel, double-click Mail.
<P>
   b. Click Microsoft Exchange Server in the list of information services,
<P><PRE>      and then click Properties.
</PRE><P>
   c. In the When Starting area, click the Work Offline And Use Dial-Up
<P><PRE>      Networking option to select it, click OK, and then click OK again.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Start your e-mail client, send a message to an Internet recipient, and
   then verify that you do not receive an NDR.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post additional information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
