The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A white paper on ShivaRemote is located on Microsoft TechNet and can also
be found on the following World Wide Web location:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ExchangeSupport/">http://www.microsoft.com/ExchangeSupport/</A></B>

</PRE>ShivaRemote 3.59, which ships with Microsoft Exchange, can be used with the
Microsoft Exchange client to allow users to remotely access a computer
running Microsoft Exchange Server (either through a computer running
Windows NT Server with RAS or Shiva LanRover). This article discusses
server settings necessary to allow a Microsoft Exchange client to connect
over Shiva.
<P>
NOTE: ShivaRemote version 3.59 will connect to any Point-to-Point Protocol
(PPP) dial-up server, but the Microsoft Exchange client over a ShivaRemote
connection is only supported specifically dialing into either a Shiva
LanRover or a computer running Windows NT 3.51 with RAS.  (Dialing into
NT 4.0 is not supported with Shivaremote 3.59)
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If possible, prior to testing ShivaRemote from a client computer, test
dialing into the computer running Windows NT Server with RAS from either a
computer running Windows NT Workstation (with RAS) or from a Windows 95
client (with Dial-up Networking). This will help eliminate the RAS server
as the source of the problem. There are updated modem scripts for Windows
NT that may also be necessary for proper operation, depending on the modem
being used on the server and client computers.
<P>
If you are unable to connect from a computer running Windows 95 or Windows
NT Workstation, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base for information on setting
up RAS under Windows NT or contact Microsoft technical Support for
assistance.
<P>
Specifically for an Exchange client to connect properly over ShivaRemote
through a computer running Windows NT Server with RAS:

<OL><P><LI>Access must be granted to all remote users in the Remote Access
   Administrator utility. Open the utility (Windows NT creates a Remote
   Access group when RAS is installed on the server), click
   Users/Permissions, click each user you want to allow dial-in
   capabilities, and select the "Grant dial-in permission to user" check
   box.

<P><LI>In Control Panel Network, click Remote Access Service, click Configure,
   and click Network. Ensure the "Require Microsoft encrypted
   authentication" check box is not selected in the Network Configuration
   dialog box of Windows NT RAS. Check either the "Allow any authentication
   including clear text" or the "Require Encrypted Authentication" check
   box.
<P>
   If the "Require Microsoft encrypted authentication" check box is
   selected, the Client computer will receive the following error message
   when connecting:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Unable to negotiate LCP connection. Please check that remote device
      is installed and configured, and that dial-in is enabled.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Ensure the Windows NT account does NOT have the "User Must Change
   Password at Next Logon" check box selected.
<P>
   If you have this check box selected, you will receive the following
   error message when attempting to log on to Microsoft Exchange :
<P>
<P><PRE>      The MS Exchange directory service could not be opened. You must
      change your password before logging on for the first time.
</PRE>
<P><LI>If IPX is desired as the protocol for connectivity over ShivaRemote,
   either Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) or a
   NetWare server must be configured to respond to the find_nearest_server
   query.  For FPNW, this option is set through Control Panel FPNW,
   "respond to Find_Nearest_Server request."

<P><LI>ShivaRemote 3.59 requires a local account to be granted dial-in access
   (version 3.59 does not understand Domains). A RAS server primary domain
   controller (PDC) or backup domain controller (BDC) is recommended.
<P>
   If the computer running RAS is only a member server, you must grant
   dial-in access to a local account on the server running RAS by first
   creating a local account via User Manager for Domains (with the same
   username and password as the domain account), selecting User/Select
   Domain and typing the machine name of the computer running Windows NT
   Server with RAS.
<P>
   Then access must be granted to that local user via the Remote Access
   Admin utility by selecting Server/Select Domain and typing the
   machine name of the RAS server, then selecting the local account you
   wish to grant access to.
<P>
   Windows NT PDC's or BDC's "local accounts" are also the Domain accounts,
   (unlike a computer running Windows NT Server that has two sets of
   accounts: the local accounts for the machine and the domain accounts).
   Because of this, it is recommended to have the computer running Windows
   NT Server with RAS set up as a PDC or BDC.
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCE</h2>
 
<P>
Updated modem scripts for use with ShivaRemote can be found on Shiva's
web page at www.shiva.com under "support"/modem scripts.
<P>
Additional configuration information may also be found in the Config.hlp
file installed during installation of the ShivaRemote software.
<P>

supported Shiva configurations for use with Microsoft Exchange:
