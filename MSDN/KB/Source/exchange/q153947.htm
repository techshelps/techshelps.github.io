The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you run the Microsoft Exchange Optimizer program (Performance Wizard)
on a computer with a 9-GB Seagate (model ST19171N or ST19171W) or a 23-GB
Seagate (model Seagate ST423451N or Seagate ST423451W) or a 9-GB Hewlett
Packard hard disk drive, you may observe the following problems:
<P>

<UL><LI>You may no longer have access to the data on the hard disk drive.

<LI>When you attempt to access the data, you may receive:
<P>
<P><PRE>       - Lost Delayed Write Data error message or an Event ID
<PRE></PRE>         26 in the Windows NT Event Log.

       - STOP 0x7F or 0x77.

</PRE><LI>Using the Microsoft Windows NT Disk Administrator, you may notice that
   the total size of the drive does not equal the originally created
   partition size.
<P>
</UL>This problem is not 100-percent reproducible and although there are reports
that other 9-GB drives may be affected, these reports have not been
confirmed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Optimizer program can create this problem because it
uses low-level APIs to disable write caching on hard disk drives. Any
program that uses these APIs will run into the same problem.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Do not run the Microsoft Exchange Optimizer program.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version
4.0. A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 5.0 Server U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE>The new Perfwiz.exe included in the Service Pack will not repair a hard
disk drive that has already been altered by the old Performance Optimizer 
tool. It only prevents further problems on new hard disk drives.  
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Restoring from backup to a new hard disk drive is the best method for
recovering the data. Currently, the affected hard disk drive must be sent
back to the manufacturer to be reset.
<P>
After implementing this fix, administrators will have to disable write
caching themselves. Please contact your hardware manufacturer if you do not
know how to disable write caching.
<P>
The 9-GB Seagate and Hewlett Packard hard disk drives are manufactured by
Seagate and Hewlett Packard, vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this products performance or
reliability.
