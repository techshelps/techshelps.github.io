<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive duplicate messages when retrieving Internet mail on
subsequent connections with the Exchange Internet Provider, if your
connection to the mail server is disrupted.
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange e-mail client, with the Exchange Internet Provider,
transports messages through the Internet using Post Office Protocol Version
3 (POP3). This protocol requires that the client issue a QUIT command
before the mail server removes messages marked for deletion.
<P>
If the connection is disrupted before the client can issue the QUIT
command, all messages marked for deletion will remain on the server and be
downloaded again on the next connection.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Internet Provider uses the POP3 protocol as outlined
in RFC 1725. This is a protocol that outlines how e-mail clients connect to
a POP3 server to send, retrieve, and delete mail.
<P>
When the client downloads mail from the POP3 server, it marks the messages
for deletion unless COPY is specified from the Remote Mail menu in
Exchange. After all messages are downloaded successfully, the Exchange
client issues the POP3 command QUIT, which causes the session to enter the
Update state. During the Update state, mail marked for deletion is removed
from the server and the network session (TCP) is closed.
<P>
If a session terminates for some reason other than a client-issued QUIT
command, the POP3 session does NOT enter the Update state and will not
remove any messages from the server. This method assures that all messages
are received OK before being deleted.
<P>
The QUIT command must be supported by all POP3 implemented servers and
clients, including Microsoft Exchange.
<P>
Common problems that will cause an interrupted POP3 session include:

<OL><P><LI>Lost carrier over a Dial-Up Networking connection via modem.
</OL>2. Failure at the network layer that causes TCP/IP connection to be
<PRE>   dropped.
</PRE></OL>3. Call waiting signal on telephone line that causes a modem connection to
<PRE>   be lost.
</PRE>4. Down POP3 server.
