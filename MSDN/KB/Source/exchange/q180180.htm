<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a Microsoft Mail user forwards an unedited message that includes
several attachments to an Exchange user via the Microsoft Mail Connector,
it is possible that the last attachment may be lost. Also, if the forwarded
message ends with text, it is possible that the Exchange recipient will
receive the message with the last part of the text missing.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When an unedited Exchange message is forwarded to an Exchange user, it is
possible that it does not end with a CRLF (carriage return, line feed).
When such a message enters Exchange, the message transfer agent (MTA)
truncates the last portion of the message data.
<P>
If the forwarded message includes several attachments, then the truncation
action might remove the last attachment. In this case, the Exchange
recipient will receive the message with the last attachment lost. If the
the last object in the message is in a text format, then the Exchange user
may receive the message with some missing text at the end.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Before forwarding such a message, edit it by adding some text after the
attachments and after the important text in the body of the message. This
will force the client to rewrite and reformat the message, which will then
preserve the attachments. The extra text is added as a precaution to
guarantee that there is no important text lost.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
