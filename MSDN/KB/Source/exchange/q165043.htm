The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you have installed at least one Microsoft Exchange Server, version
5.0, in a Microsoft Exchange Site that previously only contained version
4.0 Servers, the Schema was upgraded in order to support new object types
such as NNTP, LDAP, and so forth. This directory information was then 
replicated throughout the Site. If you now attempt to install a new 
version 4.0 Server in this Site, it will fail with the following error 
message:
<P>
<PRE>   An internal error has occurred during directory replication. Stop and
   then restart the directory service. Then try directory replication
   again.

   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
   ID no:c1030b0d

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To successfully add a version 4.0 Server to this Site, you must first make 
sure that you are attempting to install the Service Pack 1 (SP1) release of 
Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0. If the file dates on the compact 
disk are earlier than July 1996, you do not have the SP1 version. Once you 
have the correct compact disk, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the \setup\&lt;platform&gt; directory, and all of its sub-directories 
   from the Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 SP1 compact disk to an
   accessible location such as a local drive or network share.
</OL>2. Copy Setup.exe from the Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 compact
<PRE>   disk in the \support\Exch40\&lt;platform&gt; directory to the installation
   tree that you created during step 1, overwriting the existing Setup.exe.

</PRE></OL>Because the new Setup.exe accounts for the Schema differences, it will 
successfully complete the replication portion of the installation process.
