The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes what you need to do to run the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program in an untrusted NT domain when your Microsoft
Exchange Servers are in different NT Domains.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program to connect to a
Microsoft Exchange Server, NT security is determined by user account that
is logged in. In other words, the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program
passes the NT security information from your current NT login to the
Microsoft Exchange Server. If the security credentials received by the
Microsoft Exchange Server are not in the permissions list on the three
containers, Organization, SITE or Configuration, of the Microsoft Exchange
Server,
an error indicating that you do not have sufficient permissions will be
displayed.
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Exchange Administrator: A connection could not be made to the
   Microsoft Exchange server computer '&lt;server name&gt;'. You do not have the
   permissions required to complete the operation. Microsoft Exchange
   Director ID no: DS_E_INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS_RIGHTS.

</PRE>If you are in an untrusted NT Domain and need to use the Exchange Admin.exe
program to connect to an Exchange Server, you will need to create a NT user
account in the untrusted domain with the same username and password as an
account in the Exchange Server's NT Domain. This account will also need to
be added, with Admin privilege, to the list of permissions on the Exchange
Server's Organization, Site and Configuration Containers.
<P>
<PRE>   Note: To connect, you must type in the Microsoft Exchange Server name.
         Browse will not work for untrusted NT domains.

</PRE>Also, if you are in an untrusted domain and logged in as any user
(including Administrator) and try to connect to a Microsoft Exchange Server
with the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program when there is no similar
account (includes both user and password) in the Microsoft Exchange Server
Domain, you will receive an error indicating that the Microsoft Exchange
Server did not respond.
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Exchange Administrator: A connection could not be made to the
   Microsoft Exchange Server Computer '&lt;server name&gt;'. The Microsoft
   Exchange Server Computer does not respond. Microsoft Exchange Directory
   ID no:

   DS_E_COMMUNICATIONS_PROBLEM."

</PRE>If the Exchange Server computer is only a member server of the domain and 
not a PDC or BDC, remote administration will not work. The Exchange Server 
must be either a BDC or a PDC. This is the only way that the pass-through 
security will work. The computer attempting to connect to the Exchange 
Server computer can be either a member server or a Domain Controller.
