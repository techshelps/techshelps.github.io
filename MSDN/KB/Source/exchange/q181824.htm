The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange information store database may experience one of
the following symptoms during normal operation:
<P>
During an offline defrag (ESEUTIL /D) of the database, the process stops
with JET error -1601(JET_errRecordNotFound) or -1603
(JET_errNoCurrentRecord).
<P>
During normal operation, you may get a -1069 error
(JET_errVersionStoreOutOfMemory) in the application log.
<P>
If you run the consistency checker (ESEUTIL /G &lt;db&gt; /V /X piped to a text
file), it reports ERROR: corrupted LV(number) (lid changed without root).
<P>
The information store service (Store.exe) may access violate during normal
operation when it encounters corrupt data.
<P>
<P>
The information store process is utilizing 100 percent of the CPU time all
consumed by one thread (there are occasions when up to three threads will
be affected). You can view this by following these steps:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Start the Windows NT Performance Monitor.
   2. From the Edit menu, click Add To Chart...
   3. In the Object drop-down list box, select Thread.
   4. In the Instance list box, select all values that contain "store".
   5. Click the Add button.


</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the Jet database engine goes to insert a record into the binary tree
(b-tree), it may find a record with the same primary key that is marked for
deletion. Because the node is just marked for deletion and has not been
physically deleted yet, the Jet database engine "undeletes" the node and
changes its data to that of the new record. Because the Jet database engine
is changing the data associated with the record, the Jet database engine
may be changing the record's size. If the record becomes too big for the
page, the Jet database engine has to perform a b-tree split. During the
split, the Jet database engine must release the latch on the pages in the
tree and then re-latch them when the split is completed. In rare
circumstances where the information store cleanup thread comes along in the
small delta where the pages were unlatched, the information store cleanup
thread may remove the page marked for deletion. When the Jet database
engine tries to re-latch the pages, it does not know the record has been
removed. As a result, the information store either stops responding (uses
100 percent processor time in one or more threads) or corrupts the data.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Apply the fix described below. The Jet database engine has been fixed to
detect whether the page has been removed and to take appropriate action if
it has.
<P>
If you have already experienced the corruption symptoms of this problem,
you can do the following to repair the corruption with NO loss of data and
no need to run ISINTEG -fix:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure the new Ese.dll file described below is in place
   (\winnt\system32).
</OL>2. Stop the information store service.
3. Run ESEUTIL /P &lt;dbswitch&gt; /X to repair the corruption.
4. Restart the information store service.
<P>
If you have not experienced any of these symptoms but want to be proactive
and prevent this corruption from occurring, make sure the Ese.dll file is
in place (\winnt\system32) and restart the information store service.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
High CPU utilization or a stoppage of the information store will occur if
there are exactly two nodes on the page being split. This is because the
Jet database engine will try to split one record on a page, which is not
possible.
Data corruption will occur if there are more than two nodes on the page
being split. This is because Jet database engine will replace the node
immediately after the one it intended to insert to.
