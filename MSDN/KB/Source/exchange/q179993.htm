The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The public folder is displayed in the Public Folder hierarchy, but when you
try to access the public folder from a Microsoft Exchange client, the
following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   The folder could not be opened. The contents of this public folder
   are currently unavailable. Either the MS Exchange server computer
   servicing this public folder is down or the public folder has not
   been replicated to this site.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Public folders can be copied (replicated) to other servers in your site.
When a replica of a public folder exists on another server, the information
it contains is updated with current information during public folder
replication.
<P>
Although the public folder appears in the public folder hierarchy of the
client, the public folder's replication has not been completed.
<P>
Alternately, the public folder may be accessible but empty or not updated
with current information. This may also occur because the replication
process has not been completed, and this information has not yet been
replicated to the replicated server or servers.
<P>
Allow the specified duration to elapse as displayed on the Replication
Schedule property page of the public folder properties.
<P>
The Folder Replication Status property page may also be used to view the
replication status of all servers on which a particular public folder is
replicated. Ensure that the replicas are listed and updated.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use the Replication Schedule property page to indicate the times at which
this individual public folder will be replicated to other replicas of the
folder that exist throughout your organization.
To set the replication schedule for all public folders on a server, use the
public information store Replication Schedule property page.
NOTE: If a schedule is set for a specific public folder, it overrides the
schedule set for a server.
<P>
Use Information Store Schedule:
Select this option if you want this public folder to use the same schedule
that you set on the public information store Replication Schedule property
page.
<P>
Never:
Select Never if you never want the associated event to occur.
<P>
Always:
Select Always if you want the event to occur every 15 minutes.
<P>
Selected Times:
Select Selected Times to designate specific times or blocks of time in the
schedule grid.
<P>
Detail View:
Select 1 Hour to view the schedule grid in one-hour increments, or select
15 Minute to view the schedule grid in 15-minute increments.
<P>
NOTE: There is no option for "Replicate Now" for public folders.
Replication only occurs during scheduled instances as described above.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In an environment where public folder replication occurs over a slow link
such as a 56-KB connection, this process has been seen to take a little
while longer to complete than the specified times in the Replication
Schedule property page.
<P>
