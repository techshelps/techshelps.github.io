<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following checklist is intended as an aide in configuring X.400
connectivity between Microsoft Exchange Servers. This effort is not
intended to replace observations on previously operational connections that
may point to the actual problem, but rather, as a guide to succesful
configuration of between Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agents (MTAs).
The term 'server' refers to a Windows NT server that has Microsoft Exchange
Server Enterprise Edition or Standard Edition with the X.400 connector
installed.
<P>
MORE INFORMATION
 

<OL><P><LI>Can each server can ping the IP address of the other?
   No  - Resolve network issue.
   Yes - If you want to use the server name versus the ip address proceed
<PRE>         to step 2, otherwise proceed to step 3.

</PRE><P><LI>If the server name will be used in lieu of the IP address of the target
   MTA, ping the server name. Note: DNS will support server name resolution
   or a lmhosts or hosts file may be used. The lmhosts and hosts files are
   located in the 'winntdir'\system32\drivers\etc directory. The form for
   a lmhosts file is ip address, tab, server name, tab, #PRE, and a tab
   followed by a #DOM:domain_name if the server is a domain controller.
   The format for a hosts file is IP address, a tab, and then the server
   name.
<P>
   Did the server name return an ip address?
   No  - Resolve problem with name resolution.
   Yes - Proceed to step 3.

<P><LI>Have the administrator configuring a given MTA record the following
   information for the MTA to which they desire to connect.
<P>
   Remote Server name: This entry is not case sensitive and may not exceed
   32 characters in length. This entry is the name of the NT server where
   the target Microsoft Exchange Server is installed.
<P>
   Remote MTA password: This entry is case sensitive and may not exceed a
   length of 64 characters. If the other MTA has a password, you must enter
   it here.
<P>
   For the simplest configuration, select the defaults, which is no
   password.

<P><LI>T selector: This value is optional. This value is specified on the
   Outgoing OSI address information of the Stack tab. The value cannot
   exceed 32 text characters (64 HEX characters). By default, Microsoft
   Exchange uses the value(s) specified in the Outgoing OSI address
   information for the value(s) in the Incoming OSI address information.
   If a T selector is used, it is critical that the value be an exact
   match with the corresponding value specified for the T selector on
   the target Microsoft Exchange Server. If the remote admin wants to
   specify a S selector and/or a P Selector, this should be done after
   successful messaging has been established. The T, S, and P selectors
   are supported between Microsoft Exchange Servers.

<P><LI> Use the Overide tab to specify the Local MTA and Password. The MTA
<P><PRE>    will use the name of the NT server on which Microsoft Exchange
    Server is installed for the MTA name. If no incoming password is
    desired, use of the Override Tab is unnecessary. Using a password is
    redundant because the T selector provides adequate security.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Use the Connected Sites tab to configure the address space that will
<P><PRE>    be associated with the target Microsoft Exchange Server. The Address
    Space tab should only be used on a Microsoft Exchange Server that
    connects to a foreign MTA.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program and select the
    Configuration object. Highlight the Site Addressing object in the
    right-hand window and double-click it. Select the Routing tab and click
    Recalculate Routing. This ensures that the routing table for the Site
    reflects current changes.
</PRE>
<P><LI> The information on the Advanced tab of the X.400 Connector should not
<P><PRE>    require modification.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Make a custom recipient on both Servers or send a message to a user on
<P><PRE>    the foreign server using a 1-off address in the To: line.
</PRE><P>
</OL>Example of 1-off:
<P>
[x400:c=us;a=attmail;p=organization;o=locale;s=lastname;g=firstname]

<OL><P><LI>If the above test fails in either direction, highlight the Server
<P><PRE>    object in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program. With the
    Server object highlighted, open the File menu and select the Properties
    option. Select the Diagnostics Logging tab and increase the
     MSExchangeMTA X.400, Interoperablility, and APDU logging to Medium.
    This will result in increased logging to the Bf0.log, Ev0.log and
    Ap0.log in the MTADATA directory.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Repeat the send mail testing.
