The Information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When a Microsoft Exchange client for Windows, Windows 95, and Windows NT
attempts to run a Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer (EFD) form,
it searches for the executable file in the following locations, in this
order:

<UL><LI>Memory (RAM)
<LI>Local or Shared Hard Disk Drive
<LI>Current Folder
<LI>Personal Forms Library
<LI>Organization Forms Library
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Memory (RAM)</h3>
 
<P>
The three most recently opened EFD executable files are left in memory. This
is the first place the Microsoft Exchange client looks for an executable
file. If the correct form is found, the Microsoft Exchange client just has
to make it visible (re-loading the form is not necessary). This gives a
marked performance gain for the form.
<P>
Up to three Microsoft Exchange forms are left in memory after they are used.
This provides a significant activation performance increase, but it does
use system resources, because all .DLL and .OCX files used by the form
remain active and in memory until the user exits Microsoft Exchange.
<P>
<P><h3>Local or Shared Hard Disk Drive</h3>
 
<P>
This path is located under the Windows\Forms directory. If the Microsoft
Exchange client fails to find the executable file already loaded in memory,
it looks to see if it is already installed on the local or shared disk.
<P>
To configure how much disk space to commit to these forms executable files:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu of the Microsoft Exchange client, click Options.

<P><LI> On the Exchange Server tab, type the number of kilobytes in "Maximum
<P><PRE>    space on hard disk."
</PRE><P>
</OL>The Microsoft Exchange client will keep that many kilobytes' worth of forms
executable files in the forms disk cache (Frmcache.dat). 2048 KB worth of
forms executable files is the default.
<P>
<P><h3>Current Folder</h3>
 
<P>
If the form is installed directly into the current folder (the form that is
highlighted), the Microsoft Exchange client installs the form from there.
If found the Microsoft Exchange client will install the form to the local
or shared hard disk drive in the forms disk cache and remove the least
recent used form if this exceeds the maximum disk space setting.
<P>
<P><h3>Personal Forms Library</h3>
 
<P>
Failing to find the form on disk, the Microsoft Exchange client looks to
see if the form is installed in the Personal Forms Library. If found there,
the Microsoft Exchange client will install the form to the local or shared
hard drive in the forms disk cache and remove the least recent used form if
this exceeds the maximum disk space setting.
<P>
<P><h3>Organization Forms Library</h3>
 
<P>
This is the last place the Microsoft Exchange client looks for a form.
<P>
<P><h3>If the Form is Not Found</h3>
 
<P>
If all of the above searches fail, the Microsoft Exchange client will
display the header and body of the custom message and open it with
the standard note. A warning that the form is not being displayed
correctly is included in the body of the message.
<P>
NOTE: The above examples are referring to send forms. Post forms behave the
same way with the exception of Personal and Organization Forms libraries,
in which all public folders, as well as the current folder, are searched.
