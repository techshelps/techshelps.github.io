<P>
When working with public, mailbox, or personal folders, a user with Owner
permissions can modify the forms associated with that folder by specifying
information on the Forms Tab of the Properties Dialog for that folder.

The Forms Tab can be used to copy or install a custom form into the
selected folder. Forms that you have copied or installed in a folder are
listed on the Compose menu when that folder is open. The Forms Tab also
allows you to specify what forms are allowed in the folder with the
following options:
<P>
<PRE>   Only Forms Listed Above
   -----------------------
   Allows only those forms that are listed under Forms Associated
   With This Folder.

   Forms Listed Above And The Standard Forms
   -----------------------------------------
   Allows forms that are listed under Forms Associated With This
   Folder, New Message forms, New Post forms, and files such as
   documents and spreadsheets.

   Any Form
   --------
   Allows any form.

</PRE>If you attempt to post or send to the folder with a form that is not
allowed, you will receive the error message or Non-Delivery Report
mentioned above.
