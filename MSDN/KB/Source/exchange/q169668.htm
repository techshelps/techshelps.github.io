The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Server documentation states that the Eicon cards are
the only X.25 cards supported by Microsoft Exchange Server. This is not
true; in some cases X.25 cards manufactured by SAT are also supported.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The statement that only Eicon cards are supported refers only to the
installation of the X.25 protocol stack within the Microsoft Exchange
Server Administrator program. Currently only Eicon cards can be used for an
X.400 connector using a native X.25 connection.
<P>
There are, however, three ways to use an SAT X.25 board with a Microsoft
Exchange Server computer.

<UL><LI>One way is to configure a software PAD on top of both X.25 boards. Then
   a RAS connector is configured between the two Microsoft Exchange Server
   computers.

<LI>The two other configurations require the XLAN-IP product to route the IP
   protocol over the X.2 physical link. On the computer running Microsoft
   Exchange Server, either configure a site connector

<LI>or add a TCP/IP stack and configure an X.400 connector. This solution
   has the advantage of supporting both a site connector and an X.400
   connector. On the other hand, it produces more protocol overhead and is
   not suited to very slow X.25 connections (less than 9,600 baud).
<P>
</UL><h2>REFERENCE</h2>

SAT is an X.25 board manufacturer whose Atlantis X.25 for Windows NT and
Atlantis X.25/ISDN PCI for Windows NT cards are supported by Microsoft
