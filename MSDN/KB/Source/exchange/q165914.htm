<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector is installed with the Microsoft
Mail Connector. Only one Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector will be installed in
a Microsoft Exchange Site. To make free/busy information available to all
Sites in your Microsoft Exchange Organization, you must replicate the
directories between Sites and replicate the Schedule+ Free/Busy Information
public folder on every Server that has the Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector
installed. Use the Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector Options property page to
configure Microsoft Exchange Server to replicate Microsoft Schedule+
Free/Busy information between Microsoft Exchange Server Sites and Microsoft
Mail postoffices. Once you have configured the Schedule+ Free/Busy
Connector, you can start it by choosing the Services icon from the Control
Panel. There are very few parts to the gateway and if the following
methodical approach is followed, most, if not all, issues relating to both
the Microsoft Mail Schedule distribution process and the Microsoft Exchange
Server Free/Busy connector should work.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Verification of proper connector setup:
<P>
   There are two Microsoft Knowledge Base articles to reference when
   troubleshooting the connector:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCHANGE/Q147698.htm">Q147698</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE:      XADM: Configuring the Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../zMiscellaneous/Q141755.htm">Q141755</A></B>
      TITLE:      PC WSPlus: How to Setup Schedule Distribution

   Also look at the README.WRI file on the Microsoft Exchange Server
   compact disk.

</PRE><P><LI>Things to check on the Microsoft Exchange Server:
<P>
   a. Verify that Mail flows between the Microsoft Exchange server and
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Mail postoffices.
</PRE>   b. Verify that Directory Synchronization (DirSync) is functioning.
   c. Verify that the distribution list being used contains the ADMINSCH
<P><PRE>      Accounts for all PO's to be included in the Free/Busy Process.
</PRE>   d. Verify that the Sending time for the Free/Busy connector is set to 15
<P><PRE>      minutes or greater.
</PRE>   e. Set logging on the Free/Busy connector to External or higher.

<P><LI>Things to Check on Microsoft Mail:
<P>
   a. Run Adminsch.exe (from the Schedule+ diskette that ships with
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Mail).
</PRE>   b. Verify that the Microsoft Exchange Server is listed (so the adminsch
<P><PRE>      account can receive information).
</PRE>   c. Verify that the default sending time is set to 15 minutes or greater.
   d. Verify that Schdist.exe is running against all Microsoft Mail
<P><PRE>      postoffices included in Schedule Distribution but not against the
      Microsoft Exchange Proxy postoffice.
</PRE>   e. Use the -V and -l&lt;path&gt;\logname.log command line switch to have
<P><PRE>      Schdist.exe create a log file.
</PRE>   f. Do not run a Windows Mail client using the adminsch account, use a
<P><PRE>      DOS client instead.
</PRE>
<P><LI>What to do when things go wrong:
<P>
</OL>If free/busy information is not being seen on the Microsoft Exchange
Server:
<P>
<PRE>   a. Verify that mail is flowing between Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft
      Mail.
   b. Verify, in Adminsch.exe, that the Microsoft Mail postoffice is
      sending to the Microsoft Exchange Server.
   c. Verify that Schdist.exe is being run against the postoffice in
      question.
   d. On the Microsoft Exchange Server computer, review the Event Log for
      Event ID's. 1004 (MSExchangeFB) refers to a message being received
      from the Schdist process.

</PRE></OL>If Free Busy information is not being seen on MS Mail:
<P>
<PRE>   a. Verify, in Adminsch.exe, that the Microsoft Exchange Server Proxy
      postoffice is listed and that the Last received time is current.
   b. Review the logs created by Schdist.exe, looking for errors processing
      messages.
   c. Verify that Schdist.exe is being run against the Microsoft Mail
      postoffice.
   d. Verify that the Adminsch account for the Microsoft Mail postoffice is
      listed in the Distribution list used by the Free/Busy connector.
   e. Review the Microsoft Exchange Server computer's Event Log for 1002
      errors.

</PRE><P><LI>When all else fails:
   a. Reset the Admin.prf and .pof files on one Microsoft Mail postoffice
<P><PRE>      by copying them to a safe location and then deleting them from the
      CAL directory.
</PRE><P>
</OL>Note: Resetting these files will cause missing Free/Busy information for
individuals until those individuals log into Schedule + and make a change
to their schedule.  At that point, the client will write all free busy
information to the 00000000.POF For Resources, someone will have to log in
as the resource and make a change to the schedule in order to have the
Free/Busy re-populated. The Admin.prf file is recreated when Adminsch.exe
is run and postoffices are added.
<P>
<PRE>   b. On the Microsoft Exchange Server, run the Microsoft Administrator
      program and bring up the properties of the Free/Busy Connector.
      Instead of using the Distribution List which contains all the
      Microsoft Mail postoffices, only use the Adminsch account on the
      postoffice listed above.
   c. Set logging on the Free/Busy connector to External or higher.
   d. Set logging on the Schdist.exe using -v and -l.
   e. Make a change to a Microsoft Mail schedule.
   f. Start Schdist.exe against the single postoffice only. You should see
      a message being generated destined to the Microsoft Exchange Server.
   g. Wait for the message from Schdist to be picked up and delivered to
      Microsoft Exchange.
      Increase the Logging on the MSMI to view this.
   h. Once delivered you should see the 1004 event in the Microsoft
      Exchange Server computer's Event log.
   i. On Microsoft Exchange, have a user create an appointment.
   j. After waiting 15 minutes, you should see event id 1003, which will
      show the F/B gateway sending a message.
   k. Start Schdist.exe on the Microsoft Mail side and you should see the
      message being received.
   l. Verify in Adminsch.exe that the last received time is current.
   m. Check a client on both the Microsoft Mail and Microsoft Exchange
      side, verifying the Free/Busy information for the users is being
      displayed.
   n. At this time, add back the Microsoft Mail postoffices, one at a time.
