<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The message transfer agent (MTA) may stop responding; the following event
appears in the Event Viewer application log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 2110
   Source: MSExchangeMTA
   Type: Error
   Category: Internal Processing
   Description: A fatal MTA database server error was encountered. A bad
   list member length is on object 06000044. File offset: 0. Attribute ID:
   4096. Referenced object 00000000 (0=&gt;N/A). Referenced object error: 0.
   (DB Server XFER-IN 15 42](16).

</PRE>When this error occurs, the MTA stops responding because a bad message is
being processed on the affected server. If you run MTACHECK, it reports no
errors. Each time the MTA is restarted, the same error occurs with a
different object (06######) referenced each time.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot this error, attempt to isolate the problem to a bad local
DAT file in the Mtadata directory:

<OL><P><LI>Run MTACHECK.

<P><LI>If MTACHECK does not correct the problem, try finding the referenced
   DAT file (06######.DAT) in Mtadata. If it is there, move it to another
   directory or rename it. Restart the MTA to confirm whether the event ID
   2110 recurs.

<P><LI>If this error still occurs after you try to troubleshoot the local MTA,
   find out more information about the topology of the Microsoft Exchange
   environment.
<P>
   Find out whether there is any mail entering the Microsoft Exchange
   environment through the Internet Mail Connector (IMC), a foreign X.400
   system, or a Microsoft Mail Connector. These servers will most likely
   be the source of the bad message. Troubleshoot those servers that have
   these connectors installed, and see whether there are actually problems
   originating on those servers:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a. Check the Event Viewer Application Logs, and verify that the MTA
<PRE></PRE>         is running fine on those servers.

      b. Look in the MTA queue (on other adjacent servers) for mail
         destined for the affected server (that is, the server that is not
         responding and is experiencing Event ID 2110) with an old
         time/date stamp. If there is anything suspicious there, try to
         delete the messages that appear to be old or corrupt.

      c. If the MTA appears to be running with no problems on those
         servers, consider shutting down the MTAs (one at a time)
         and running MTACHECK on each of the computers.

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The portion of the event description in parentheses (DB Server XFER-
IN 15 42) indicates which part of the MTA code was executing when the bad
message was encountered.
<P>
In the case where "(DB Server XFER-IN 15 42)" is shown, there is an
increased possibility that the bad message can be found on an adjacent
server that is trying to deliver the message to this local server.
<P>
In the case where "(DB Server DISP FANOUT 22 42)"is shown, the bad message
can probably be found on the local server in \MTADATA.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0 and 5.0.
<P>
We are researching this problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0 and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
