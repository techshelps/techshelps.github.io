<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Exchange Server can be configured to participate in Directory
Synchronization as a Requestor (DXA Requestor) to a MSMail PostOffice
DirSync Server. Improperly including the DXA Requestor in the MSMail PO's
Dispatch program (from the command line or Dispatch.ini) will result in the
following error:
<P>
<PRE>  Failure while accessing the process table.

</PRE>This error can be found in the MSMail Dispatch Monitor and Dispatch.log.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This error is a result of the MSMail Dispatch program's inability to read
the Process.glb file of the Requestor. The Dispatch program polls
PostOffices on the LAN for DirSync events. Dispatch.exe connects to
PostOffices by logical drives. You specify the location of the PostOffices
to be connected and indicate how they are to be connected from the command
line, or in the Dispatch.ini. In this scenario, the Microsoft Exchange
Server is a DXA Requestor and is erroneously included in the Dispatch
process. While polling the DXA Requestor for DirSync events, the Dispatch
program tries to read the DXA Requestor Connector PostOffice's Process.glb
file. Although the Connector PO has a GLB subdirectory
(Exchsrvr\Connect\Msmcon\Maildata\Glb), the Process.glb file is not
present.
<P>
Unlike MSMail Requestors, the DXA Requestor does not rely on the Dispatch
program for DirSync processing, rather it processes its own T1 and T3
times. T1 is scheduled through the Configuration, Connections, &lt;DXA
Requestor&gt;, Schedule property page. As for T3, the DXA Requestor
dynamically applies the changes as soon as they arrive.
<P>
Adding MSMail Requestors to the Dispatch.ini is routine for MSMail
PostOffices; however, a Microsoft Exchange Server should not be added to
the Dispatch process.
<P>
NOTE: This error message will not prohibit the DirSync process from
completing successfully.
