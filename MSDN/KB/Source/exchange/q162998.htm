The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 4.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Move Mailbox command in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program is
used to move a mailbox from one server in a Microsoft Exchange site to
another. This command may appear to have completed successfully, but when
the user logs into the mailbox, they no longer see mail received prior to
moving the mailbox.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Move Mailbox command moves the mail from the private information store
of the old server to the private information store of the new server. It
then changes the Home Server attribute of the mailbox to the new server and
replicates this information from the old server to the new server and all
existing servers in the site. If the Home Server attribute is not updated
or this information is not replicated to the new server before the user
logs back into their mailbox, the condition above may occur.
<P>
Steps to verify the Move Mailbox command moved the user's mail to the new
server:

<OL><P><LI>Connect to the new server in the Exchange Administrator program.

<P><LI>In the Properties of the private information store of the new server,
   verify that the user is listed on the Mailbox Resources tab and that the
   number of items reflects the amount of mail the user had prior to
   the move.
<P>
</OL>Items to check to verify the Move Mailbox command failed to change the home
server of the mailbox:
<P>
- The mailbox is still listed in the Server Recipients container
<PRE>  of the old server and does not appear in the Server Recipients
  container of the new server.

</PRE></OL>- The General Property page of the mailbox lists the old server
<PRE>  as the home server.

</PRE>- The Exchange Client profile for that user shows the old
<PRE>  server, and the attempt to change it to the new server fails.

</PRE>After you confirm that the mail is located on the new server and the
mailbox is located on the old server, follow these steps to move the
mailbox to the new server:

<OL><P><LI>Access the mailbox on the old server with the Microsoft Exchange
<P><PRE>     Client and pull all new mail received since moving the mailbox to a
</PRE>   personal folder. Exit and log off the Microsoft Exchange Client.

<P><LI>In the Exchange Administrator program, connect to the old server and
   highlight the mailbox in the Server Recipients container of the old
   server. Press the DELETE key to delete the mailbox.

<P><LI>Wait until this change has propagated to all Microsoft Exchange
   Server computers in the site.

<P><LI>In the Exchange Administrator program, connect to the new server
   and perform a DS/IS Consistency Adjustment on the new server. This
   should create the directory entry for the mailbox on the new
   server.

<P><LI>Verify the mailbox is created on the new server and located in the
   Server Recipients container of the new server.

<P><LI>If necessary, reassign the Windows NT account to the mailbox. This can
   be done on the General tab of the mailbox's Property page.

<P><LI>Change the Microsoft Exchange Client profile for the user to point to
   the new server, and have the user access their mailbox. Old mail
   should be available. New mail can then be dragged and dropped from
   the personal folder to the Inbox.
