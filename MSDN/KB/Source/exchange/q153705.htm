The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If Microsoft Exchange is installed in a Token Ring environment and
Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x clients are configured so that the
connection to the Microsoft Exchange Server is made via IPX/SPX, the
clients might be unable to send messages with attachments larger than
approximately 10K. The messages will sit in your Outbox and will never be
sent to the Microsoft Exchange Server. At this point, any subsequent
messages will also fail to leave the Outbox.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur as a result of mismatched network packet frame
sizes between the Microsoft Exchange client workstation and the Microsoft
Exchange Server.
<P>
Token-Ring adapters can have network packet frame sizes of more than 16K as
opposed to Ethernet, which generally uses 1500 byte frames. Usually the
software drivers for Token-Ring cards use a frame size of approximately 4K,
but different manufacturers may use different values. In a NetWare
environment, if the frame sizes on the computer that is running the
Microsoft Exchange Client and the computer running Microsoft Exchange
Server do not match, the client will report network errors when sending
large e-mail messages or when moving or copying items from the user's Inbox
to a public folder. The error text notes the operation that failed and
attributes it to "network problems." For example, if the operation being
attempted was copying a message from the Inbox to a public folder, the
error text would be "An item could not be copied. Network problems are
preventing a connection to the Microsoft Exchange Server computer."
<P>
To solve this problem, adjust the frame sizes on the server and client to
match. When the client Token-Ring driver loads, take note of the maximum
packet size that it reports. You will need to set the server's maximum
packet size to match this value. For the Token.com driver that ships with
NetWare 3.12 and 4.x, the default size that it will report is 4210.
<P>
To change the maximum packet size on the server, start the Network
application in Control Panel, highlight the Token-Ring adapter card entry,
click the configure button, and then change the setting and save it. If you
are using the Windows NT driver for IBM Token- Ring, use the registry to
configure the Maximum Packet Size. This is a DWORD registry entry with a
path of
KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\IBMTokx\Parameters
(where x is the optional adapter number) and the parameter is
MaximumPacketSize. Use the decimal value from the client's driver
specification. Restart the server for the new setting to take effect.
<P>
For more information on configuring other Token Ring adapters, refer to the
manufacturer documentation included with the adapter.
<P>
For Windows 95 Clients, to force even length Packets, go to Start,
Settings, Control Panels, Network, highlight the "IPX/SPX" transport, click
properties, click on the Advanced tab, and set "Force Even Length Packets"
value to "yes".
