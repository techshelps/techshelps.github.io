The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you are installing Exchange Server version 5.5 or upgrading to
Exchange Server version 5.5, the process may fail and the following three
error messages may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   An unexpected error occurred in the upgrade process.
   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
   ID no: c1032c00

</PRE>-and-
<P>
<PRE>   ERROR: Your upgrade did not complete successfully. Please restart your
   Microsoft Exchange services and your system will behave as it did before
   the upgrade was attempted.
   Please contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
   Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
   ID No: c1032c08

</PRE>-and-
<P>
<PRE>   A fatal error has occurred. Check that you have sufficient memory and
   disk space available.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These error messages may appear during the upgrade or the installation
process if there are insufficient system resources, such as low memory, or
insufficient hard disk space available to perform the upgrade. Corruption
in the database also may cause the upgrade process to fail.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If failure is due to insufficient system resources, freeing disk space or
adding additional hardware should correct the situation. Freeing memory by
closing any running applications or unnecessary services may also allow the
upgrade to complete.
<P>
If failure is due to corruption in the database (.edb) files, the store
files will have to be repaired using the EDBUTIL program before the upgrade
or installation to version 5.5 can take place. For more information on
using the EDBUTIL program, consult the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator's Guide, or see Knowledge Base article <B><A HREF="../EXCHANGE/Q143233.htm">Q143233</A></B>, "XADM:
Command-Line Parameters for Edbutil.exe."
<P>
If you chose the Fault Tolerant method during the upgrade process,
restarting the services should be the only recovery method needed to
continue using the previous version of Exchange Server. This is because the
Fault Tolerant installation method copies the database files to a backup
directory before beginning the conversion process to Jet97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The error messages may be somewhat confusing because all three error
messages appear regardless of the cause of the upgrade failure. The first
two errors may apply to any problem during a failed upgrade, but the third
error message appears even though it has no reflection on the database
being corrupted.
