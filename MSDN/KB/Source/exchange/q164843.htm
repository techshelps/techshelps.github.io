<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The ability to separate a reply address from an e-mail address is an
enhancement to Microsoft Exchange. As originally released, changes to the
reply address would also change the e-mail address. With this enhancement,
the reply address can be set independently from the e-mail address.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This enhancement is included in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a custom recipient is created in Microsoft Exchange, the recipient is
considered to have one e-mail address that Microsoft Exchange will pass
mail to. This is also referred to as the target address for the recipient.
This e-mail address appears on the General property sheet when looking at
the properties of the custom recipient.
<P>
Microsoft Exchange supports creating additional addresses for recipients.
This is done through the E-mail Addresses tab when you view the details of
a recipient. This functionality gives Microsoft Exchange the ability to
deliver mail to a user who has multiple addresses.
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Administrator program also allows a user to send
mail with a reply address that differs from the e-mail address that
Microsoft Exchange uses to deliver mail to this recipient. This address is
selectable when there is more than one e-mail address of a single type. The
"Set as Reply Address" button is used for this purpose.
<P>
For additional information about fixes related to the use of multiple
e-mail addresses and the target e-mail address, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE>NOTE: When this update has been used to modify a custom recipient, it is
not advisable to use an older version of Microsoft Exchange Administrator
to make changes to the same recipient addresses. The following message box
may result:
<P>
<PRE>   ------------------------------------------------
   Microsoft Exchange Administrator
   An internal processing error has occurred:
   The attribute or value exists.
   Try restarting the Administrator program or
   the Microsoft Exchange Server computer, or both.
