<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to send mail to a recipient in your Personal Address Book
(PAB), and this PAB entry was migrated from a version 3.x Microsoft Mail
for Windows mail message file (.mmf), you may get the following
undeliverable message from the System Administrator:
<P>
<PRE>   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

   Subject:msgsubject
   Sent:1/1/80 4:05:41PM

   The following recipients could not be reached:
   Migrated Ms Mail User (X400)’ on 1/1/80 4:05:42PM
   The message was undelivered because the specified recipient postal
   address was incorrectMSEXCH:MSExchangeIS:sitename:SERVERNAME

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During the migration process of a .mmf file (either through the Migration
Wizard or Import menu option), the existing PAB entries are created in a
Microsoft Exchange Personal Address Book. With a Microsoft Mail X400 type
PAB entry, all of the fields in the recipients OR address are migrated
regardless of whether they contain data. For example, if a user created a
X400 PAB entry in Microsoft Mail using the X400 fields template as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Alias: User1
   Country Code: US
   Administration Domain Name:  (one space)
   Private Domain Name: MICROSOFT
   Personal Name: Surname: user1
   Given Name:
   Initials:
   Organization Name: SiteName
   Organizational Unit Names (OU):
   Organizational Unit Names (OU):
   Domain attribute type:
   value:
   Domain attribute type:
   value:
   Comment:

</PRE>When the above is migrated into a Microsoft Exchange PAB, and a message is
addressed to this user, the address formed for the recipient will be as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   c=US;ADMD=;PRMD=MICROSOFT;S=User1;G=;I=;O=SiteName;OU=;OU=;DDA.TYPE=;
   DDA.VALUE=;DA.TY PE=;DDA.VALUE=

</PRE>Even though the fields (G, I, and OU) had no value (ADMD contains a single
space and is valid) in the Microsoft Mail PAB entry, they were still
migrated into the newly formed address in Microsoft Exchange. Blank entries
are invalid for X400 fields; therefore, the Message Transfer Agent rejects
the message and the Information Store returns it to the sender.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The migration utilities were updated to parse out any blank or null fields
that exist in a Microsoft Mail X400 PAB entry. By parsing out these blank
fields, a valid X400 address is formed in the Microsoft Exchange PAB and
messages will no longer NDR. The same address as above will look as follows
after you apply the fix:
<P>
<PRE>   C=US;ADMD= ;PRMD=MICROSOFT;S=User1;O=SiteName.

</PRE>NOTE: The fix needs to be applied before you migrate the .mmf file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange
Server U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,

spaces):
