The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you send a message to a Microsoft Exchange Distribution List (DL), you
may receive the following non-delivery report (NDR) for one or more
recipients:
<P>
<PRE>   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

      Subject:   &lt;Some subject&gt;
      Sent:   &lt;Date and Time&gt;

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

      /o=&lt;Organization&gt;/ou=&lt;Site&gt;/cn=RECIPIENTS/cn=&lt;Mailbox&gt; on &lt;Date and
    Time&gt;

   The message was undeliverable because the recipient specified in the
   recipient postal address was not known at this address
               MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:&lt;Site&gt;:&lt;Computer name&gt;

</PRE>The DL in the global address list shows the above user is not a member of
the DL nor an active user on the system.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This situation occurs when a user mailbox that was a member of the DL is
deleted from the Exchange Server computer. All changes to objects such as
mailboxes are updated in the transaction logs for the Microsoft Exchange
directory and then later committed to the directory store (DIR.EDB) for
fault tolerance. The Exchange message transfer agent (MTA) does not read
the transaction logs, only the DIR.EDB, so the MTA must wait for the
changes to be committed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem will correct itself within a short period of time. On a large
system, however, it may be desirable to run a Knowledge Consistency Check
to speed up the process.
