<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, versions 4.0 and 5.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you add a service to a profile, such as a Personal Folder, you might
want to select the Cancel button during the configuration of the service
and expect the installation of the service to aborted. However, the result
is the service is installed but not configured.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version
4.0 Windows, Windows NT, and Windows 95 clients. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you press the Cancel button during the configuration of several of the
services for the Microsoft Exchange clients, such as Internet Mail (Windows
95), Microsoft Mail, and Personal Address Book, you will receive the
following information dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   The service you have just added will not start until you choose Exit
   and Log Off on the File menu, and then restart Microsoft Exchange.

</PRE>After you select the OK button, the service is installed even though the
Cancel button was pressed.
<P>
If you select the Cancel button during the configuration of Personal
Folders, the following dialog box is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Properties for this information service must be defined prior to use.

</PRE>The result is the same; an unconfigured Personal Folder service is
installed.
