<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Dynamic RAS Connector can be configured to connect
two different Microsoft Exchange Organizations. This article describles
some details that must be configured correctly to get mail flowing in both
directions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Administrator's guide, on page 190, refers to
Connected Sites. To connect two different Organizations, the Connected
Sites Property page of the Dynamic RAS connector must be configured
properly. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.
</OL>2. Click the New button to add a new Site.
3. In the dialog that appears, enter in the information about the Site. It
<PRE>   is important to note that the Organization defaults to your Organization
   name. This entry must be changed to reflect the Organization that you
   will be connecting to.
</PRE></OL>4. Click the Routing tab and verify that the X.400 routing information
<PRE>   matches the X.400 Site Addressing of the other Site.
</PRE>5. Click the OK button to add the Connected Site.
<P>
After this is complete, recalculate the routing for the changes to be
updated. Repeat this process on the other Microsoft Exchange Server. Once
this is complete, it will be possible to send mail in both directions. To
update the Global Address List, X.400 custom recipients can be used. This
can be obtained by exporting both Directories and importing them into the
other Site. For information on how to use import, refer to the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCHANGE/Q152659.htm">Q152659</A></B>
   TITLE: XADM: Importing Exchange Accounts from Another Organization

</PRE>NOTE: Connected Sites should list only those Sites that are directly
adjacent to the connector. Knowledge of all other Sites can only be
inherited through directory replication and directory replication will not
occurr between two different Microsoft Exchange Organizations.
