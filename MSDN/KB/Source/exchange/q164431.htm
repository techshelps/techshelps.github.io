</UL>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
