<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article outlines the steps necessary to remove the first Microsoft
Exchange Server installed in a Microsoft Exchange site.
<P>
In addition to any mailboxes and public folders, by default the first
Server in a Site will contain and be responsible for the Site Folders. Site
Folders consist of the Off-line Address Book folder (OAB), the Schedule+
Free Busy Information folder, and the Organizational Forms folder, if one
exists. Other Servers installed in the Site rely, by default, on the first
Server for this information. For example, in order for the third Server in
the Site to generate the OAB, it must make a connection to the first
Server. Removing the first Server in the Site without performing the steps
in this article might lead to the data contained in these Site Folders
becoming inaccessible or lost.
<P>
The first Server in the is also, by default, the Routing Calculation
Server. The Routing Calculation Server is responsible for updating the
Site's Gateway Routing Table (GWART). This responsibility also must be re-
assigned before removing the first Server from the Site. For information
about doing this, please see the following article in the Microsoft 
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCHANGE/Q162012.htm">Q162012</A></B>
   TITLE     : XADM: Unable to Change the Routing Calculation Server     

</PRE>If you have removed the first Server in the Site before reading this
article, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCHANGE/Q152960.htm">Q152960</A></B>
   TITLE     : XADM: Rebuilding the Site Folders in a Site

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before removing the first Microsoft Exchange Server in the Site, follow
these steps to avoid problems:
<P>
IMPORTANT: If there are any users or Public Folders (non-Site) homed on
this Microsoft Exchange Server, the mailboxes must be moved to another
Server in the Site, and any Public Folders must be replicated to other
Servers in the Site, to ensure no loss of data. Please refer to the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator Guide, chapters 12 and 15, for more
information.
<P>
Off-line Address Book:

<OL><P><LI>Pick a Server in the Site to contain the OAB.
</OL>2. Using the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, select the
<PRE>   Configuration container and open the properties of the DS Site
   Configuration object.
</PRE></OL>3. In the Offline Address Book Server drop down list, select the Server
<PRE>   that was chosen in Step 1.
</PRE>4. Click the Generate Offline Address Book Now button.
5. Click OK.
<P>
Schedule+ Free Busy Information and Organizational Forms:

<OL><P><LI>Pick a Server in the Site to contain the Schedule+ information and the
   Organizational Forms.
</OL>2. Using the Microsoft Exchange Administrator Program, select the
<PRE>   Configuration container, the Servers container, and the Server chosen in
   step 1.
</PRE></OL>3. Double-click the Public Information Store object.
4. Click the Instances tab.
5. In the Public Folders list box, select the Schedule+ Free Busy
<PRE>   Information and Organization Forms folders and click Add. Note that
   these folders should have the name of the first Server in the Site after
   the dash, in other words, Schedule+ Free Busy Information - firstserver.
   This process creates a replica of these folders on the Server chosen in
   step 1.
</PRE>6. Click OK.
<P>
Routing Calculation Server:

<OL><P><LI>Pick a Server in the Site to be the new Routing Calculation Server.
</OL>2. Using the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, select the
<PRE>   Configuration container and double-click the Site Addressing object.
</PRE></OL>3. Click the General tab.
4. In the Routing Calculation Sever drop down list box select the Server
<PRE>   chosen in Step 1. You must make some other change in the properties
   pages to activate the Apply button so the changes will be retained.
</PRE>5. Click the Routing tab and click the Recalculate Routing button.
6. Click OK.
<P>
NOTE: We recommend that the first Server in the Site be powered off or
unplugged from the network temporarily after the above steps are performed
to verify that this procedure has completed successfully. Once the changes
have been verified to work (start a Microsoft Exchange client and verify 
that you are able to access the Schedule+ free/busy information of another 
user and can generate an Offline Address Book), leave the first Server off 
the network, or powered off, and then perform the following steps to 
permanently remove this Server from the Site:

<OL><P><LI>Using the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, select the
   Configuration container and then the Servers container.
</OL>2. Highlight the first Server in the Site.
3. Click Delete from the Edit menu or hit the delete key on the keyboard.
<P>
NOTE: If a Microsoft Exchange Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector still appears 
in the Server Recipients Container of the first Server after all other 
items have been moved (re-homed) to the new Server, the Schedule+ Free/Busy
Connector will not move automatically and will also be deleted when the first
Server is removed from the Site.  To recreate this object, follow the steps 
listed in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A HREF="../EXCHANGE/Q148199.htm">Q148199</A></B>
   TITLE     : Recreating a Deleted Schedule+ Free/Busy Agent         

</PRE></OL>To Include Schedule+ Free Busy Information:
<P>
The Schedule+ Free Busy Information site folder will be repopulated as users 
log on to Schedule+ and generate changes. During this period some users' 
Free Busy information will be temporarily unavailable.
<P>
Until a user logs on and makes an appointment (a "busy" time) there will be no 
"free / busy" information to view.
