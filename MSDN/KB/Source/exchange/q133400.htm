<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA),
all high-priority messages are moved to the top of the MTA work queue.
However, the MTA will transfer the messages depending on the schedule of
the X.400 connector or site connector used. In other words, all messages
(high or low priority) wait for the X.400 connector or site connector to
establish the connection based on the connector's schedule, but all high-
priority messages will be at the top of the work queue.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each X.400 connector or site connector in Exchange Server has its own
schedule, which defines the specific times and blocks of time when the
Exchange Server MTA can initiate connections to the other Exchange Server
MTA or foreign mail system. This schedule can be set from the X.400
Connector's or Site Connector's Schedule property page from the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator program.
<P>
Whenever a message is handed over to the Exchange Server MTA, the MTA
decides, based on the routing information, which X.400 connector or site
connector to use to send the message. Once a connector is identified by the
Exchange Server MTA, the MTA moves the message into that connector's queue.
If the message is high priority, it is placed at the top of the queue for
that connector.
<P>
The Exchange Server MTA cannot initiate a connection on the connector until
the connector's schedule permits it to do so. This means that all messages
(with either high or low priority) will sit in the queue until the X.400
connector or site connector is scheduled to connect and transfer messages.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
A site called DALLAS has the following connectors to three other sites:

<OL><P><LI>X.400 connector to New York on X.25 transport stack is scheduled to
   connect only between 11:00 P.M. and 5:00 A.M.

<P><LI>Site connector to Seattle is scheduled to connect always.

<P><LI>X.400 connector to Houston on Remote Access Services (RAS) transport
   stack is scheduled to connect only between 8:00 P.M. to 8:00 A.M.
<P>
</OL>If a user at site Dallas sends a high-priority message to users in New
York, Seattle, and Houston at 10:00 A.M., the message is transferred at the
following times:

<OL><P><LI>The message is put at the top of the work queue for the X.400 connector
   to New York because it is a high-priority message. The X.400 connector
   to New York will connect at 11:00 P.M. and will then move the message to
   New York.

<P><LI>Because the site connector to Seattle is scheduled to connect always,
   the message is moved as soon as the Exchange Server MTA hands the
   message to this connector.

<P><LI>The message is put at the top of the work queue for the X.400 connector
   to Houston because it is a high-priority message. The X.400 connector to
   Houston will initiate a call at 8:00 P.M. and then move the message to
   Houston.
