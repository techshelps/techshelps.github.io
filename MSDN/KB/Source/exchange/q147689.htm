<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Exchange, when you make intrasite connections, each server
within a site is responsible for passing its information to every other
server within the site. It performs this information transfer by using
Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). A site may contain servers from different NT
Domains. This article will concentrate on Microsoft Exchange Servers that
exist within a single NT Domain.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The rights that are necessary for installing a Microsoft Exchange Server
within a single NT Domain include the following:

<UL><LI>You must be logged in as a user with Administrator privileges or logged
   in as the default Administrator account.

<LI>The user account should be included in the Domain Admins Group and this
   group should be a member of the local Administrators group.

<LI>An account with "Log On As Service" rights must exist. This account
   should have been created when the first Microsoft Exchange Server was
   installed within the site. NOTE: THIS SAME ACCOUNT SHOULD BE USED FOR
   ALL EXCHANGE SERVERS WITHIN THE SITE. This account is automatically used
   by all servers subsequently added to the site but the password will have
   to be supplied. This allows for simplified validation of security
   information because all Microsoft Exchange services will be running
   under the same security context.
