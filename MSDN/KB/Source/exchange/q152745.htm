The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you attempt to delete a public folder from the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program in raw mode (starting the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program with Admin.exe /r), the public folder might be placed
in a state in which the folder still appears in the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program, but the properties of the folder can no longer be
modified. If you attempt to view the properties of the folder from the
Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, you will received the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The object cannot be found in the directory. This may be because
   replication has not completed. Microsoft Exchange Directory ID no:
   c1010aae.

</PRE>Note: Microsoft Exchange clients can continue to use the public folder
without any problems.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, perform a DS/IS consistency adjustment. This
should return the public folder to its proper state.
<P>
In the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program:

<UL><LI>Open the Microsoft Exchange Server's property page.
<LI>Click the Advanced tab.
<LI>Change the DS/IS consistency adjustment to All Inconsistencies.
<LI>Click the Adjust butoon.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Public folders should always be deleted from a Microsoft Exchange client,
not the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program. To delete a folder, you
must be the owner of the folder. If you are an administrator and you need
to delete a folder, add owner permissions for yourself to the public folder
and then delete the public folder through the following procedure:
<P>
From the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program:

<UL><LI>Under Organization, Folders, Public Folders, select the specific public
   folder that needs to be deleted.
<LI>Click Properties on the File menu.
<LI>Click the General Tab and select Client Permissions.
<LI>Add or change ownership of the public folder.
<P>
</UL>Now log into Microsoft Exchange from a Microsoft Exchange client using the
account that now has ownership of the public folder and delete the folder.
<P>
