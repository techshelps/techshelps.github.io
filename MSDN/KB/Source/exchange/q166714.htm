The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client does not support drag-and-drop
functionality from the operating system to an Open Compose message or
folder. However, there is limited support for attaching files to a New
Compose message. Using AppleScript, you can create a script that prompts
for a file and allows the Exchange client to be opened, New Compose message
window to be opened, and the selected file to be attached.
<P>
NOTE: AppleScript is included with the Macintosh operating system; if it is
not present, re-install the operating system to add AppleScript.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: This AppleScript requires System 7.5 or higher to function correctly.
<P>
Apple Events allow for certain actions to be automated and saved as
scripts. These AppleScripts (very similar to a macro) will work with any
application that is scriptable. The Exchange Macintosh client is ONLY
scriptable in the following manner.
<P>
To create the script:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Apple Script Editor, usually located in the AppleScript folder
   within the Apple Extras folder on the machine's local hard disk drive.

<P><LI>Type the following in the script window below at the bottom of the
   editor.
<P>
<P><PRE>      on run
<PRE></PRE>         set file1 to choose file
         tell application "Microsoft Exchange &amp; Schedule+"
            open file1
         end tell
      end run

   The above script applies to Microsoft Exchange version 5.0. For
   Microsoft Exchange version 4.0, change the third line to:

      tell application "Microsoft Exchange"

</PRE><P><LI>Click the Check Syntax button; there should be no errors reported.
   You must correct any syntax errors before continuing.

<P><LI>Select the File menu and choose Save As. Choose a location for the
   script to be saved; remember this location. Change the Kind selection to
   Application and select the Never Show Startup Screen option.

<P><LI>Save the script with the following name EXCHOPENDOC in the chosen
   location.
<P>
</OL>You should now be able to double-click on the saved script to test it. The
script should result in a Chooser window appearing and allowing you to
select a file to attach.
<P>
The Exchange client will start using the default profile; you will be
prompted for your username and password information. Once these are
validated, Exchange Client opens a new message window and attaches the
selected file. Upon sending or closing the new message, Exchange Client
will close and the script is completed.
<P>
NOTE: This script should be used while the Microsoft Exchange Server is
running. If the Microsoft Exchange Server is not running, nothing will
happen and no errors will be reported.
<P>
NOTE: If the Exchange application has been hidden then the new compose
message will also appear hidden. Only by unhiding Exchange will the new
compose message appear.
<P>
Some suggestions for use of this script are to create a macro in Microsoft
Word to call the script. Once the macro is created it may be shown as a
toolbar button or menu command. Here is an example of a Word macro:
<P>
<PRE>         Sub MAIN
   MacScript("exchopendoc")
   End Sub

</PRE></OL>Note: This will not attach the current open Word document. The current
document must be saved and then selected when using with Word.
<P>
Another use for this script is to make an alias to the AppleScript file and
place the alias file in your Apple Menu Items folder in the System folder.
This allows the calling of the script from anywhere within the Macintosh
operating system.
