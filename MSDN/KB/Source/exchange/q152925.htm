The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to start the Microsoft Exchange client, the client may
temporarily hang or may be prompted multiple times for domain credentials.
These credentials are for the domain where the Microsoft Exchange Site
that owns the Organization Forms folder is located (for example, let's 
call it Site B). The pop-up dialog box also appears when you attempt to 
open a read receipt, delivery receipt, or non-delivery report.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. When the client logs on to Site A, there is an
attempt to locate a forms library and to bind to it if it exists within
the Microsoft Exchange Organization. If the only instance of the Forms 
Library exists in Site B and affinity is set, then the Microsoft Exchange 
client will attempt to connect to a Microsoft Exchange Server (containing 
the Forms Library) in Site B. This may cause the following symptoms:

<UL><LI>Clients in Site A are slow when attempting to open a read receipt,
   delivery receipt, or non-delivery report but clients in Site B open 
   them at normal speed.
<P>
   Affinity is set to Site B, but the client in Site A has no physical LAN 
   connection to Servers in Site B.

<LI>Clients in Site A and Site B are slow when attempting to open a read 
   receipt, delivery receipt, or non-delivery report.
<P>
   The Server conatining the only instance of the Organization Forms folder
   is not available.

<LI>Clients in Site A are prompted for Domain credentials but clients in Site 
   B are not prompted.
<P>
   A trust does not exist between Site A NT Domain and Site B NT Domain.
   Therefore, when a Site A client attempts to access Organization Forms folder
   on a Server in Site B, it will be prompted for Domain credentials for a
   valid NT account in Site B.
<P>
</UL>IMPORTANT - If no Organization Forms folder instances are available in the
Site, but there is at least one Site available with instances, the Affinity
to the Sites is used to rank the order in which connections to the Sites
will be attempted. The affinity is set on the site Public Folder Affinity
page. Clients must have RPC connectivity to the servers in the Affinity
Sites. Otherwise, the clients will not be able to access the public
folders in the other Sites, even though the Affinity has been correctly set. 
Thus causing possible client slow down.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Remove the affinity to the Site that owns the Organization Forms
   folder (Site B).
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Create a local Site instance of the Organization Forms folder by
   replicating the folder from Site B to Site A.
<P>
</UL>If an Organizations Forms folder is created within the Organization, it is
recommended this folder is replicated to Sites that may not have a
physical connection (ie dial up connection) or are connected via slow link to 
the Organization Forms folders Home Site.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You will be prompted for domain credentials when all of the following
conditions are met:

<UL><LI>An Organization Forms Folder has been created.
<LI>A Public Folder Affinity has been established between the sites.
<LI>No local instance of the Organization Forms folder exists.
<P>
