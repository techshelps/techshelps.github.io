The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to upgrade to Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, you
may receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   An unexpected error has occurred.
   ID No.  c106fdda

</PRE>If you chose a Fault Tolerant setup, you will receive an error
similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Your upgrade did not complete successfully. Please restart your
   Microsoft Exchange services and your system will behave as it did before
   the upgrade was attempted.

</PRE>If you did not choose a Fault Tolerant setup, you will be asked to
restore your databases from backup.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when setup is attempting to upgrade one of the
databases that is inconsistent.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, exit the setup program and restore
the databases if needed.
<P>
While the Directory and Information Store services are stopped,
run the following commands to verify consistency of each database:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;drive&gt;:\exchsrvr\bin\EDBUTIL /mh &lt;&lt;Full Path&gt;&gt;\DIR.EDB
   &lt;drive&gt;:\exchsrvr\bin\EDBUTIL /mh &lt;&lt;Full Path&gt;&gt;\PRIV.EDB
   &lt;drive&gt;:\exchsrvr\bin\EDBUTIL /mh &lt;&lt;Full Path&gt;&gt;\PUB.EDB
   &lt;drive&gt;:\exchsrvr\bin\EDBUTIL /mh &lt;&lt;Full Path&gt;&gt;\XDIR.EDB

</PRE>For the database that is inconsistent, run the following command
to attempt to force consistency:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;drive&gt;:\exchsrvr\bin\edbutil /r /ds or /ispriv or /ispub

</PRE>If the directory, private, or public database does not become
consistent, restore from good backup, verify consistency, and
rerun setup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The upgrade process to Exchange Server 5.5 upgrades all Exchange
databases including the Priv.edb, Pub.edb, Dir.edb, and also the
Xdir.edb in the DXADATA directory, which contains directory
synchronization information if directory synchronization has been
setup on this server.
<P>
If the upgrade process fails on the Xdir.edb, this database may be
inconsistent due to an ungraceful shutdown. To verify the
consistency of this database, run the following command from the
Exchsrvr\Bin directory:
<P>
<PRE>   Edbutil /mh &lt;path&gt;\dxadata\xdir.edb |more

</PRE>A portion of the screen output will show the state of the database
to be either consistent or inconsistent.
<P>
If the database is inconsistent you must attempt to make it
consistent by doing one of the following:
<P>
- Start the Directory Synchronization service, which will attempt
<PRE>  to perform a soft recovery and replay it's log files.

  -or-

</PRE>- Run Edbutil /r &lt;path&gt;\dxadata\xdir.edb.
<P>
NOTE: This database is not backed up with Online Backup utilities
and can only be restored if there  is an offline copy available.
