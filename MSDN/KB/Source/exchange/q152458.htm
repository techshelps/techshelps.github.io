<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 and 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, when you view the Mailbox
Resources tab under properties of the Private Information Store object in
the Server container, a mailbox may report having a number of messages and
kilobytes being used on the server store but all folders in the client’s
viewer are empty (including Deleted Items).
<P>
For example, Mailbox Resources viewed from the Administrator program may
show User A to have a total of 7,943 KB and 15 items. However, if User A
logs on to the Information Store and goes through every folder located on
the server, there are no messages present.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible causes for the discrepancy between the Microsoft
Exchange Server Administrator program and Microsoft Exchange Client:

<OL><P><LI>A user or users have Microsoft Exchange Forms installed in the
   Personal Forms registry and/or server based folders. Installing forms
   in the personal forms registry and/or server based folder uses space
   on the Information Store for that user's mailbox.

<P><LI>A user is set up (or was previously set up) as the administrator mailbox
   for the Schedule+ Free Busy Connector mailbox.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To clear up the discrepancies (if you want to), follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Remove or move Forms from the Personal Forms registry and/or
   server-based folders

<P><LI>Log on to the Information Store using Microsoft Exchange Client or
   Outlook.
<P>
   If one does not exist create a set of Personal Folders for this profile
   (this is only required if you want to move the forms)

<P><LI>Select a folder from the PST and get properties on the folder.

<P><LI>On to the Forms tab, click Manage.

<P><LI>In the left pane, click Set.

<P><LI>Select the Forms Library option and click Personal Forms in the list
   box.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Select any forms installed in the Personal Forms registry to highlight
   them, and click Copy to move the form(s) to the PST folder
<P>
   -OR-
<P>
   click Delete to remove the forms from the Personal Forms registry.
<P>
</OL>Once all forms are moved/deleted, view mailbox resources with the
Administrator program; the discrepancy should be cleared up.
<P>
Some Free/Busy messages sent between Exchange Server and Microsoft Mail go
through the user's mailbox specified in the Administrator field within
properties of the Schedule+ Free Busy Connector's mailbox in the Server
Recipients container. These messages may get stranded there if the Free
Busy Connector administrator is changed often and/or if the connector is
taken down for a period of time. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to
remove these messages from the administrator's mailbox. Because these
messages are placed in the IPM.Root Folder of the mailbox, the only way to
clear them is through the use of MD VU32.EXE (a utility shipped in the
Support directory on the Exchange Server compact disc). To perform this
cleanup using MDBVU32, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On a workstation that has a profile created for the user who is (or was)
   the Free Busy Connector's administrator, create a directory called MDBVU
   and copy the following files from the Support\Utils\&lt;Platform&gt;
   directory on the Exchange Server compact disc:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Mdbvu32.exe
      PropVu32.dll
      StatVu32.dll
      TblVu32.dll
      XvPort dll
</PRE>
<P><LI>Start the Microsoft Exchange Client or Outlook client and log on to the
   Free Busy Connector’s adminstrator mailbox

<P><LI>From the MDBVU directory, start Mdbvu32.exe.

<P><LI>Click OK in the MAPILogonEx dialog box.

<P><LI>On the MDB menu, click OpenMessageStore.

<P><LI>From the displayed list of message stores, select the Mailbox - &lt;user’s
   friendly name&gt; entry and click the Open button.

<P><LI>On the MDB menu, click Open Root Folder.

<P><LI>In the MAPI_FOLDER - Root dialog box that is displayed, look in the
   Messages in Folder box for Sched+ entries. Select the Sched+ entries

<P><LI>From the Operations Available list box, select the lpFld-
   &gt;DeleteMessages() entry and then click the Call Function button on
   the right  side of the list box. This should result in the Schedule+
   messages being removed from the root folder.

<P><LI>In the MAPI_FOLDER - Root dialog box, click Close.

<P><LI>On the MDB menu, click Store Logoff and click OK on the lpMDB-
   &gt;StoreLogoff() dialog box, then clear the message box.

<P><LI>On the Session menu, click Session Logoff.

<P><LI>On the Session menu, click Exit to close Mdbvu32.
<P>
</OL>View the Mailbox Resources tab for this mailbox; the discrepancy should be
cleared up.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available. Investigation is
being done to make identifying and clearing up data in all server-side
folders an easy process.
