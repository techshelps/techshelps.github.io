The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When double-clicking on an attachment with a file extension of DCX (Fax
document), the following error message may occur:
<P>
<PRE>   Program Not Found
   Windows cannot find Faxview.exe.
   This program is needed for opening files of type 'DCX Image Document'."

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs because the Microsoft Exchange client is not installing
Faxview.exe on computers running Windows NT 4.0, but is associating DCX
file types to Faxview.exe. The Microsoft Exchange client Setup does not
install Faxview because Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows NT 4.0 use the Imaging
Accessory (Wangimg.exe) in place of the Faxviewer Accessory.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<UL><LI>Associate files with a DCX extension with the appropriate fax viewing
   utility.
<P>
</UL>Faxview.exe will be in the &lt;Win95root&gt; directory if you have elected to
install the Microsoft Fax Viewer component of Microsoft Fax during Windows
95 setup. If Faxview.exe is available, faxes can be viewed by re-
associating DCX files with the Faxview.exe program in the &lt;win95root&gt;
directory.  If Faxview.exe is not available then the Faxviewer Accessory
will need to be installed from Windows 95 Setup before DCX files can be
associated with Faxview.exe.
<P>
Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows NT 4.0 do not have the Faxviewer Accessory
available as an installable accessory. Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows NT 4.0
use the Imaging Accessory (Wangimg.exe) in place of the Faxviewer
Accessory. If Wangimg.exe is available, faxes can be viewed by
associating DCX files with the Wangimg.exe program while using Windows 95
OSR2 and Windows NT 4.0. Wangimg.exe is located in the Program
Files\Windows NT\Accessories\ImageVue\ directory on Windows NT 4.0, and in
the &lt;Win95root&gt; directory on Windows 95 OSR2. If Wangimg.exe is not
available, the Imaging Accessory will need to be installed from Windows
95 OSR2 or Windows NT 4.0 Setup before DCX files can be associated with
Wangimg.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the error is displayed, you will have the opportunity select the
correct location of Faxview.exe by clicking Locate in the error message
dialog box.
<P>
If you are using Windows 95 and have the Windows 95 Accessory Faxviewer
installed you can locate the program Faxview.exe in the &lt;Win95root&gt;
directory. If you are using Windows 95 and do not have the Windows 95
Accessory Faxviewer installed you will not be able to locate the file
Faxview.exe unless it has been installed as part of another application.
Windows NT 4.0 does not use the Accessory Faxviewer and you will not be
able to locate the file Faxview.exe under Windows NT 4.0 unless it has been
installed as part of another application.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
