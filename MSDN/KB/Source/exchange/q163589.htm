<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Offline Folder files (OSTs) are considered slave replicas of the server-
based folders. If you delete the master, the slave is orphaned.
<P>
If the original Microsoft Exchange profile was not modified, you should 
still be able to start the Microsoft Exchange client offline with the 
old OST and recover the data by moving the messages from the OST to a 
PST file. However, if the old profile was deleted or modified (by using 
it to log onto a different mailbox) then the data in the OST is lost.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to recover mail stored in an OST provided you have not tried
to modify the profile that was used to create the OST file. If the profile 
used to create the OST file has been modified to point to a new mailbox,
the information contained in the OST file may be lost.
<P>
The reason for this is due to how security on an OST works because Windows
NT authentication cannot be used when working offline. Therefore, you must
"prove" that you're allowed to log onto the server-based master before the
OST file will give you local access. Microsoft Exchange does this by 
creating an encrypted "cookie" from your mailbox's unique entry ID while 
you are successfully logged into the Microsoft Exchange Server. This cookie 
is securely stored in your Microsoft Exchange profile. Essentially, your 
profile stores this key for the OST. Every time you try to access the OST 
file it checks your profile for the existence of this key.
<P>
By modifying the profile or trying to connect to a new mailbox or new
server with the current profile, Microsoft Exchange replaces this key with 
a new value from the mailbox that was created. At this point, there is no 
method to get into the data that was contained in the OST created against 
the first mailbox.
<P>
For more information, see the Microsoft Exchange Disaster Recovery Document
on Microsoft TechNet or on the Internet at:

</PRE><h2>Steps to recover</h2>
 
<P>
If you have not modified your profile or attempted to log in online to the new 
mailbox, use the following steps to copy the offline messages into a PST.

<OL><P><LI>Start the Microsoft Exchange client up OFFLINE.
</OL>2. Click Services from the Tools menu.
3. Click Add.
4. Add a Personal Folders (PST) service.
5. Highlight messages to be copied.
6. Click Copy from the File menu.
7. In the Copy to: dialog box, select the Personal Folders (PST) created in
<PRE>   step 4.
</PRE></OL>8. Click OK.
9. Repeat steps 5 - 8 for each folder containing messages.
<P>
At this point, the messages are copied to a PST. A new profile can be
created and you can login to the new server based mailbox. Once this
is completed successfully, a Personal Folders service can be added
(referencing the PST created above), the messages can be copied from the
PST back to the server based mailbox.
<P>
Note - Offline Folders (OST's) should not be considered as backups of your
server based store. For more information on proper server backups, refer to 
the Microsoft Exchange Administrator's Guide - Chapter 15
