The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you try to view a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications project in the
Microsoft Visual Basic Editor, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Project Locked
   Project is unviewable

</PRE>even though you did not lock the project for viewing in the properties for
the project. You may also receive this message if you click VBAProject
Properties on the Tools menu in the Microsoft Visual Basic Editor.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you try to view a project that is in a shared
workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot view a project in a shared workbook. If you want to view a
project in a shared workbook, disable sharing. To disable sharing, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the shared workbook.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Share Workbook.

<P><LI>Click to clear the "Allow changes by more than one user at the same
   time" check box, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design of Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some features in Excel 98 are not available when you use a shared
workbook. In a shared workbook, you cannot write, change view, record,
or assign macros. However, you can record a macro that is stored in
another workbook that is not shared. You can run macros that were created
before the workbook was shared; however, if you run a macro that includes
an operation that is unavailable, the macro stops at that point.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about limitations using shared workbooks, click the
Index tab in Microsoft Excel 98 Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   shared workbooks, overview

</PRE></OL>and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Limitations of shared
workbooks" topic.
