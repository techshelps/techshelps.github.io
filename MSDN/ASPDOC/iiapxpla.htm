<h1><a name="H1_37684894">Writing Cross-Platform Applications</a></h1>

<p>ASP applications can be run on computers running Windows NT&nbsp;4.0 or later and Windows&nbsp;95 or later. In addition, a streamlined version of ASP is available on the Macintosh.  Because Personal Web Server on Windows&nbsp;95 and on the Macintosh are intended for personal publishing, there are some differences in the support for ASP applications.  You can easily run applications developed on the personal publishing platforms on servers running Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation or Windows&nbsp;NT Server.  This topic describes some of the differences between the platforms.</p>

<h2><a name="H2_37685557">ASP on the Macintosh</a></h2>

<p>The Macintosh version of ASP is intended for personal publishing and provides a simpler interface to ASP scripting.  As a result, some of the features of ASP on the Windows platform are not available on the Macintosh.  For more information, refer to the Macintosh ASP documentation.</p>

<p>The Macintosh version of ASP provides built-in objects that are not automatically available on the Windows platforms.  The Windows platforms are shipped with components that provide these objects; however, you must declare these objects in the application's Global.asa file for your scripts to run without modification on the Windows platforms.</p>

<h2><a name="H2_37686462">ASP on Windows&nbsp;95</a></h2>

<p>Windows&nbsp;95 or later is intended as a personal publishing platform.  Although running ASP applications is fully supported, Personal Web Manager does not expose the more complex administration features that a Web developer might require, such as changing script and session timeouts.</p>

<h2><a name="H2_37686789">ASP on Windows NT&nbsp;Workstation</a></h2>

<p>Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation is a full development platform that supports all of the scripting features of ASP.  The default administration tool, Personal Web Manager, is designed for Web administrators who are not full-time server administrators.  For the Web developer who wants complete control of a server site during the development  and testing of ASP applications, Internet Service Manager is the appropriate administration tool.  You can run the Setup program for Personal Web Server to install Internet Service Manager.</p>
