With the release of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, some great new developer and authoring technologies hit the scene. If you want more information on the hot new Internet technologies such as Dynamic HTML and Microsoft's Active Channel technology, check out Site Builder Network (http://www.microsoft.com/sitebuilder), Microsoft's one-stop resource for Web professionals.</p>
<p>
Site Builder Network's Internet Explorer 4.0 Technologies pages (http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/prog/ie4) and Dynamic HTML pages (http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml) contain in-depth technical articles, overviews, specifications, and more about the new Internet Explorer version 4.0 technologies. If you have Internet Explorer 4.0, experience first-hand these new technologies by visiting the Dynamic HTML, Scriptlets, and data source object galleries (http://www.microsoft.com/gallery/default.asp). If you haven't yet braved the new world, get inspired by viewing the source code that makes this new technology possible. </p>
<p>
If you're upgrading from the Preview 2 (beta) version of Internet Explorer 4.0 to the final release, Site Builder Network has a list of new features in the final release. Also, be sure to take a look at the new features in JScript 3.0 development software, designed to take advantage of the power of Internet Explorer 4.0. You'll also want to read up on changes between versions 3.0 and 4.0 of Internet Explorer, and read about cross-platform support in version 4.0. </p>

The Dynamic HTML page focuses on, you guessed it, Dynamic HTML. With the final release of Internet Explorer 4.0, Site Builder Network has added an expert on the technology, Michael Wallent, to its stable of regular SBN Magazine columnists. Michael's "DHTML Dude" column will appear monthly, with how-to tips and helpful code samples. One key area of Dynamic HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), enables new positioning and layout capabilities. Using CSS, developers and authors have available more than 70 style attributes that can be applied to HTML tags. Web developers and authors enter a new era with additional formatting options for color, spacing, positioning, borders, margins, cursors, and more. The article "Filter It, Scale It, Move It, Hide It" by Web-design columnist Nadja Vol Ochs shows some cool effects using CSS and Dynamic HTML. You'll find a link to this article on Site Builder Network's Dynamic HTML pages under "How-to Articles."</p>

The Dynamic HTML Object Model in Internet Explorer 4.0 is behind all of this great functionality. For an introduction to the object model, check out "The Dynamic HTML Object Model" by Nancy Cluts. The Dynamic HTML Object Model gives you access to all page elements before load, during load, and after load. A full event model has also been implemented for mouse, keyboard, focus, and specialized events. Also see the article, "Bubble Power: Event Handling in Internet Explorer 4.0" by Michael Wallent. Both of these articles can be found on the left pane index off the Site Builder Network's Dynamic HTML pages. (Both of these articles can also be found in the MSDN Library under Technical Articles.)</p>

Microsoft supports the Channel Definition Format (CDF). At its core, CDF is all about the organization and delivery of information to users. Using CDF and Microsoft's Active Channel technology, developers can present to users a theme-based set of Web pages, called a channel. Site Builder Network's George Young offers "Channels 101" to get you started. Site Builder Network is also your route to getting your channel listed in the new Microsoft Active Channel Guide. </p>
<p>
Scriptlets are also a standard feature of Internet Explorer 4.0 allowing Web authors to create reusable objects with Dynamic HTML. Scriptlets are simply Web pages in which script has been written and a standard convention has been followed to make the script reusable. Check out the article "Scriptlets: Reusable Objects for Web Authors" on the Internet Explorer 4.0 Technologies pages.</p>
