It is a well-known fact that not only is an MSDN subscription the best resource out there for all of your Windows programming needs, but it is also by far the best polycarbonate antidepressant for the post-Nietzschean programming blues. However, we know that there's always room for improvement. So I lay down this challenge: If you think you know of a way that MSDN can change to better suit your needs, please e-mail us, fax us, or even pick up a pen and write us an old-fashioned letter-just do whatever you have to do to let us know. We can't act on all of your suggestions and we can't fill your prescriptions, but we can do our darnedest to make MSDN the best professional developer program there is.</p>
<h4>Good news, bad news</h4>
<p>
Ever since the Professional Developers Conference (PDC) in San Diego concluded, the MSDN inbox has been filled with notes from subscribers asking when they will be sent a beta (prerelease) version of Windows NT 5.0. The bad news is that (as you probably know by now) it <i>isn't </i>in the October '97 quarterly release. The good news, however, is that it <i>will</i> be in an interim shipment due to ship in the first half of November to all MSDN subscribers. </p>
<h4>Stay of execution</h4>
<p>
A small panic erupted in the MSDN community when someone pointed out that the Windows 98 Beta 2 that was included in the October '97 quarterly release would expire on January 31, 1998. "Will I have to roll back my system to Windows 95?" asked Timothy Johnson of Wyatt, Texas. No way, man-we're way ahead of you! When the aforementioned November interim package arrives, please stay calm and walk, don't run, to your mailbox because not only will the Windows NT beta be there, but Professional-level and above subscribers will also receive an updated beta version of the Windows 98 operating system. </p>
<h4>Cleaning the kitchen</h4>
<p>
The year is almost over and we're doing some number-crunching: If we keep growing at the rate we did in 1997, the MSDN binders are going to be bursting at the seams and we will have to start including the MSDN Bookshelf with each subscription, and I mean wood and nails, not a bunch of books on disc! That, or we have to cut some CDs loose. Looking through the discs, though, it was difficult (read: impossible) to determine that any could be nixed from the program. The faster, more-robust 32-bit operating systems and tools are great successors to slower, legacy 16-bit software, but we know the reality is that there is a huge installed base of 16-bit operating systems out there that developers are still catering to. </p>
<p>
So instead of removing the older technologies completely from the program, in January 1998 MSDN will be introducing the Platform Archive, a supplement to the MSDN Subscription. We will be transferring all discs with 16-bit technology as well as all Windows NT 3.51 discs from the updated subscription CD set to the Platform Archive, making room for another year's worth of next-generation technology. Full details about the Platform Archive will be in the January 98 shipment.</p>
