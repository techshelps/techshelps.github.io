<h1>Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about FAT-32</h1>
<p>
As OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) becomes more widespread, many administrators wonder if they could benefit from using a FAT-32 file system. In this article, we'll try to answer some of the more frequently asked questions.</p>
<h3>What are the advantages <br>
of using FAT-32?</h3>
<p>
FAT-32 drastically increases your free hard disk space by decreasing the number of clusters on your hard disk. No matter how big or small it is, each file on your hard disk occupies an entire cluster. FAT-16 partitions limit the number of clusters you can have on a hard disk. If your hard disk size increases, your cluster size must also increase to maintain this fixed number of clusters. For example, if you have a 512-MB hard disk, your cluster size is 8 KB. If you later install a 2-GB hard disk, your cluster size will jump to a whopping 32 KB. These large cluster sizes waste disk space. For instance, a 1-byte file will now consume 32,768 bytes on your new hard disk.</p>
<p>
Fat-32 reduces your cluster size to 4 KB for partitions that are 8 GB and smaller. In our tests, we've seen FAT-32 give us anywhere from almost 60 MB to about 200 MB of extra space. Of course, the amount of space you regain by upgrading to FAT-32 depends on how much data you have on your hard disk, how big your files are, and what cluster size your FAT-16 partition is using.</p>
<p>
The other advantage to FAT-32 is that it lets you use larger hard disks than FAT-16 does. FAT-16 limits you to a maximum partition size of 2 GB, while FAT-32's limit is 2 TB (2,048 GB).</p>
<h3>How does FAT-32 affect system performance?</h3>
<p>
As with any file system, the more clusters your hard disk has, the slower it will perform. You may notice a slight decrease in disk performance, especially if you're using a large hard disk. You'll have to decide if the space you regain by using FAT-32 is worth the performance impact.</p>
<h3>Do any other operating systems support Fat-32?</h3>
<p>
Currently, no other operating systems (including older versions of Windows 95) use FAT-32. However, Microsoft has announced that Memphis, the next version of Windows, will support this file system.</p>
<h3>Is FAT-32 compatible with older systems?</h3>
<p>
Some older computers limit your hard disk size to 512 MB or less. A few computers made as recently as last year impose a 2-GB limit on hard disk size. However, these limits are a result of the computer's BIOS and have nothing to do with FAT-32. (This is because larger hard disks may not have existed when the BIOS was first programmed.) As long as your hard disk conforms to your computer's specifications, FAT-32 will work.</p>
<h3>Is FAT-32 compatible with third-party disk managers?</h3>
<p>
Many companies ship a disk manager, such as On Track or EZ Drive, with their hard disks to allow you to use large hard disks on older computers. Most disk managers limit your partition sizes to 2.1 GB. If you want to use FAT-32 on a computer that has a disk manager installed, be sure your partitions abide by this limit. </p>
<h3>How do you install FAT-32 on a hard disk?</h3>
<p>
If you want to use FAT-32 on a computer, you'll have to reformat the hard disk. But before you do, back up your data. You'll then need to locate your boot disk. (If you haven't already created such a disk, see the article "Preparing for Disaster" in the November 1996 issue of <i>Windows 95 Professional</i> to help you do so. If you created your boot disk before you upgraded to OSR2, you'll need to create a new one, since some of the system files have changed.) Be sure that your boot disk runs the FDISK and FORMAT commands on your hard disk. It should also contain the drivers necessary to access your CD-ROM drive, if you'll be re-installing Windows 95 from CD. </p>
<p>
Insert your boot disk and restart your computer. When the command prompt appears, type <i>FDISK</i>. At that point, FDISK will ask you if you want to enable large disk support, as shown in Figure A.</p>
<p>
<img src="w9p9794a.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
<b>FDISK asks if you want to enable large disk support.</b></p>
<p>
Enter <i>Y</i> to enable the FAT-32 file system. FDISK will then ask you what you want to do with the partition, as shown in Figure B. Notice that the first line under FDISK Options tells you which fixed disk drive you're currently working on. If you're using a computer with multiple hard disks, enter <i>4</i> at the prompt to <br>
see the drive letter that corresponds to the drive. If this isn't the hard disk you intend to reconfigure as FAT-32, type <i>5</i> to change the current fixed disk drive.</p>
<p>
<img src="w9p9794b.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
<b>Use FDISK to delete and re-create your DOS partition.</b></p>
<p>
Once you've switched to the correct hard disk (if necessary), enter <i>3</i> at the command prompt. FDISK will now display the Delete DOS Partition or Logical DOS Drive screen. We'll assume that you'll be working with the primary partition. (If you have multiple partitions on the same physical drive, you may have to delete an extended partition before you can delete the primary partition.) Enter <i>1</i> to delete the primary partition. </p>
<p>
At this point, FDISK will warn you that it's about to delete all data in the partition. It will also ask you for the partition number you want to delete, as shown in Figure C. For our example, enter <i>1</i>. FDISK will then ask you to enter the volume label of the partition you're deleting. This is an extra safeguard to make sure you're really deleting the partition that you think you are. Answer <i>Y</i> to the final confirmation prompt to allow FDISK to delete your partition.</p>
<p>
<img src="w9p9794c.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
<b>FDISK warns you that you'll lose all data when you delete the partition.</b></p>
<p>
After FDISK deletes your partition, it  takes you back to the main menu. Now you need to create a new primary DOS partition. First, enter <i>1</i> at the prompt. When FDISK asks if you'd like to use the maximum available size for a primary partition and make the partition active, enter <i>Y</i>. You'll soon see a message stating that FDISK created the partition. We're now done with our boot disk, so press [Esc] to exit FDISK. </p>
<p>
Next, reboot your PC using your boot disk. When you see the DOS prompt, type <i>FORMAT C: /S</i> and press [Enter] to make the partition bootable. You now have a new partition that uses FAT-32 and that you can install Windows 95 on.</p>
<h3>Can I format my hard disk <br>
with FAT-32 before I install Windows 95?</h3>
<p>
Obviously, you don't want to have to install Windows 95 on a computer just to get a couple of files so that you can reformat your hard disk and re-install Windows 95. If your hard disk is already blank, you can simply create a startup disk from the Windows 95 CD-ROM. To do so, insert the Windows 95 CD and follow its onscreen prompts. When the Setup program asks if you want to create a startup disk, click Yes. Then answer the ensuing prompts appropriately. When Windows 95 finishes creating the startup disk, abort the installation process and reboot your computer using the startup disk. Now, perform the FDISK procedure we described in the previous section.</p>
<h3>How can I confirm that my hard disk is formatted for FAT-32?</h3>
<p>
To verify the format of your hard disk, open My Computer and right-click on the appropriate hard disk icon. Next, select Properties from the context menu. The third line of the resulting hard disk Properties sheet will tell you the format of your file system, as shown in Figure D. As you can see, our C drive is formatted for FAT-32.</p>
<p>
<img src="w9p9794d.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
<b>You can use the hard disk's Properties sheet to confirm that you properly formatted your hard disk for FAT-32.</b></p>
<h3>Can you format a zip drive <br>
with FAT-32?</h3>
<p>
To configure a hard disk to use FAT-32, you must run the FDISK utility. Since zip drives and other removable media don't use FDISK, you can't format them as FAT-32.</p>
<h3>Is there a FAT-16 to FAT-32 conversion utility?</h3>
<p>
Microsoft plans to release a one-way FAT-16 to FAT-32 conversion utility with Memphis. Until then, the only available conversion utility is built into Power Quest's PartitionMagic 3.0. You can obtain more information about PartitionMagic from Power Quest's Web site at http:\\www.powerquest.com.</p>
<h3>Can I compress a FAT-32 drive?</h3>
<p>
Windows 95 won't allow you to compress a FAT-32 drive. In fact, Microsoft has changed the manner in which you compress disks in OSR2. If you try to use the Compression Agent with OSR2, Windows 95 will display the error message shown in Figure E. It states that if you want to compress a disk, you must first install Microsoft Plus!.</p>
<p>
<img src="w9p9794e.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
<b>Windows 95 tells you that you need to install Microsoft Plus! before you can compress a drive.</b></p>
<p>
However, this message is deceptive, because OSR2 includes DriveSpace 3, which is the same compression utility that's found in Plus!. You can access DriveSpace 3 by choosing Accessories, System Tools, Drive Space. Unfortunately, DriveSpace 3 still can't compress a FAT-32 partition.</p>
<h3>Will my disk utilities work with FAT-32?</h3>
<p>
Norton Utilities 2.0 and Norton AntiVirus 2.0 offer full FAT-32 support if you install the patch available at Symantec's Web site (http://www.symantec.com). Norton Utilities 1.0 is incompatible with FAT-32.</p>
