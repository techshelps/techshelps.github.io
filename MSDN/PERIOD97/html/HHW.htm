<h1>Microsoft's HTML HELP Not Just for Help Systems</h1>
<p>
Seeking out the ideal development environment for your Web titles is rather like working a summer business meeting in a room without air conditioning: you might be interested in being there, but it's hot, and you have a lot of hands to shake. While the field of Web tools and technologies is growing even as you read this article, you do at least have the "mainstay" Web technologies to consider as a starting point. HTML, obviously-perhaps spiced up with Shockwave, VRML, or NetShow. Java™ for building custom applications. VBScript and JScript™ for capturing data and responding to user interaction. ActiveX™ components for creating targeted Web applets. Trident for integrating HTML authoring into applications of all sorts. And, of course, Microsoft's new HTML Help.</p>
<p>
What, you say? Help? Isn't that the little window that appears when you press F1? Use help to create Web titles? Real Web titles?</p>
<p>
Absolutely. Let's take a look at why.</p>
<h2>What is HTML Help?</h2>
<p>
HTML Help is the promised HTML-based online help development environment from Microsoft, which of course also developed the Windows® help system (familiarly called WinHelp) available on every Windows installation. Currently slated for release in the first quarter of 1997, concurrent with Microsoft® Internet Explorer 4.0 (IE 4.0), HTML Help will not only bring online help into the Web Age but will also offer developers of large HTML titles an authoring system that comes standard with a slew of necessary features, from a hierarchical table of contents to keyword and full-text searching to multiple windows, and lots, lots more.</p>
<h2>More Than a Help System</h2>
<p>
It's important to note that Microsoft has positioned HTML Help as not only a development environment for online help but also for other hypertext documents. HTML Help, in fact, is a great deal more than "that little window that opens when you press F1." In part, this is because HTML Help is a Web hypertext authoring environment. You can create documents that are as finite as traditional Windows help or that stretch out as far as your firewall (and your design sense) will allow your documents to go. In addition, because HTML Help content is standard HTML, you can use any of the other Web technologies you typically use to add to your document's content and interface.</p>
<p>
The development effort behind HTML Help is backed by not only the minds who created WinHelp, but also those who have worked on MediaView, Microsoft's development system for customized online documentation and multimedia titles (from the embedded help system in Microsoft Works to the integrated text, graphics, and multimedia of Encarta®). In fact, all MediaView developers have ceased work on the old system and are currently working solely on HTML Help. While HTML Help may not be suitable for creating highly customized interfaces (and even that remains to be seen), it is shaping up to be an excellent solution for creating standard hypertext interfaces with the types of navigational aids that users have come to expect in book-like hypertext documents. That means help, yes. But also encyclopedias, reference guides, document-centric multimedia titles, marketing collateral, and other such documents.</p>
<h2>HTML Help Components</h2>
<p>
The basic components of HTML Help include the HTML content, an ActiveX control, the layout engine, and the HTML Help window. The content for HTML Help is standard HTML. You can create all topics in your title as "loose" HTML topics, the way Web authors currently create Web sites, or you can compress the document as a single or several HTML documents. (I'll examine compression below.) This content can also include any of the graphic formats supported by HTML, as well as other Web technologies such as NetShow, Shockwave, VRML, animation, JScript, VBScript, and so forth.</p>
<p>
In other words, any content you can create without HTML Help you can also create with HTML Help. You can, in addition, use your favorite HTML editor to create the HTML files. HTML Help will also include its own authoring environment by the time it is released next year. (More on this later.)</p>
<p>
The HTML Help ActiveX control HHCTRL.OCX provides the navigational user interface for your title. This interface includes the table of contents, keyword and full-text searching, and some special keyword links called associative links. It also controls other functionality, such as the splash window, About box, and window background color, to name a few. </p>
<p>
The ActiveX control can be added not only to HTML Help (if you want the table of contents and index) but also to any browser that supports ActiveX technologies. The Help Workshop, the graphical environment for setting up HTML Help, includes a wizard for adding this control to your title and setting up its components, but the code itself is fairly simple. It is controlled by the &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag, which sets up such information as the location and version of the ActiveX control, as well as the control's parameters (see Figure 1).</p>
<p><b>Figure 1: HTML Help &lt;Object&gt; Tag </b></p>
<pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
&lt;OBJECT id=hhctrl type=&quot;application/x-oleobject&quot;
        classid=&quot;clsid:adb880a6-d8ff-11cf-9377-00aa003b7a11&quot;
        codebase=&quot;file:/Program Files/HtmlHelp Workshop/

    &lt;PARAM name=&quot;Item1&quot; value=&quot;file:images/splash.bmp&quot;&gt;

    &lt;PARAM name=&quot;Item3&quot; value=&quot;file:images/splash24.bmp&quot;&gt;
&lt;/OBJECT&gt;</font></pre>
<p>
The initial version of the ActiveX control is 32-bit for Windows 95 and Windows NT®. Later in 1997, Microsoft will supply equivalent 16-bit controls for Windows 3.1, Macintosh, and UNIX.</p>
<p>
The layout engine, SHDOCVW.DLL, is actually an underlying component of Microsoft Internet Explorer. The current beta of HTML Help uses the layout engine for Internet Explorer 3.0 (IE 3.0), but certain features of HTML Help, such as the compressed file format and popup windows, will require IE 4.0, since these features have resulted in modifications to the IE layout engine.</p>
<p>
The HTML Help window is the browser in which the content for your title opens. This executable, a host for the layout engine, can be evoked directly through the HTML Help API or indirectly through the HTML Help executable, HH.EXE. This method makes it easier to create context-sensitive help (help that is associated with a field or window in a software application). However, you can also open content in a browser or embed or dock the layout engine in your application without using the HTML Help window.</p>
<p>
If you've spent much time creating Web titles, you know that it's frustrating to assemble a number of technologies from a number of vendors, just to add all of the features you want in your title. What you can't find from an existing technology, you have to create yourself. HTML Help includes a great number of the navigational features that Web authors have been adding to their titles. Since Microsoft will be using HTML Help in its own help systems and online documents beginning sometime next year, these features are likely to become very familiar to Windows users.</p>
<h2>That Sitemap Format Again</h2>
<p>
If you read <i>MIND</i>'s article on sitemaps (see the October 1996 issue), you're familiar already with the sitemap format that Microsoft has proposed to World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). For HTML Help, this format is particularly important, since it controls the layout of two of HTML Help's main navigational features-the table of contents and keyword index-as well as related features, such as the window that will open when the user chooses a topic, a new feature called the information type (described later), font information, and window setup. (See Figure 2 for an example of the current sitemap format as used in HTML Help.)</p>

        &lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;</font></pre>
<p>
W3C's review of the proposed sitemap format has resulted in changes to this format. The impact of these changes on HTML Help in particular is that you will be able to store all sitemap information in individual HTML files. This means that you can add a project file to create the table of contents and index in any or all of the HTML files specified in your project, not just in a "main" project file. However, Microsoft was still adapting the format before resubmitting it to W3C at the time of this writing, so the details of the changes, and its full implications, are not yet available. (By the way, Microsoft currently states that it intends to support the previous sitemap format for about a year, so HTML Help-and any other applications that currently use this format-won't be required to change to the new format until at least the end of 1997.)</p>
<h2>
The Table of Contents</h2>
<p>
The table of contents controlled by the HTML Help ActiveX control is a tree outliner (see Figure 3). If you've ever opened the online help in Windows 95, you've seen the precursor to this control in the Contents tab. You can set up the control hierarchically, like the WinHelp Contents tab, or nonhierarchically, like a traditional Web frame. You can also adjust the length and width of the area in which the table of contents appears.</p>
<p><img src="HTMLHelp.fig03.gif">
</p>
<p><b>Figure 3: HTML Help Table of Contents</b></p>
<p>
You can use a limited set of graphics to change the metaphor for the table of contents. The default metaphor is the chapter-page that you have no doubt seen in the Windows 95 help Contents tab. Other graphics, such as a file folder/document, are also available. A topic can be marked as new; new topics have a red star in the page icon next to the title.</p>
<p>
Each topic in the table of contents can have various properties associated with it. These include the URL (local or remote) of the topic that will open when the user clicks it, the window and frame in which the topic will open, and information type associated with the topic.</p>
<h2>Searching and Linking</h2>
<p>
If you're like many Web authors, you've been using one of the standard search engines, such as Excite, to enable users to search your Web titles. These search engines do a fair job of locating content but most have fairly limited user interfaces: type in a word and hopefully it comes back with relevant hits. HTML Help includes two types of built-in searching. In addition, these facilities have a much better user interface than traditional Web search facilities.</p>
<p>
The keyword index is hierarchical, as you would see in the back of a book, and can include up to nine levels (see Figure 4). You can scroll through a list of all index terms or type words a text box. Once you find the index term you want, you just double-click it to open the associated topic.</p>
<p><img src="HTMLHelp.fig04.gif">
</p>
<p><b>Figure 4: Multilevel keyword index</b></p>
<p>
HTML Help also offers full-text searching. This search looks through all words or phrases in the HTML files in your project. The full-text search has two interfaces: one similar to InfoView (on MSDN) and one like the Find tab in the Windows 95 help.</p>
<p>
From the keyword index, you can set up local and/or remote URLs for each term. The index also supports "See Also" terms: index terms that point to other related terms, rather than jumping directly to a topic. The index supports associative links as well.</p>
<p>
Associative links are "on the fly" searches for topics that have particular keywords associated with them. When the user clicks an associative link, a dialog box opens with a list of all HTML documents in the project that have that keyword associated with them. This feature also works in the keyword index: if the user selects a term that's associated with more than one topic, a dialog box listing those topics opens (see Figure 5). Currently, this feature is only available with compressed HTML Help documents.</p>
<p><img src="HTMLHelp.fig05.gif">
</p>
<p><b>Figure 5: Multiple topic dialogue</b></p>
<h2>Information Types</h2>
<p>
A feature of HTML Help that beta testers have been particularly excited about is the information type. Information types identify the type of content associated with a topic listed in the table of contents and control what type(s) of information should appear in the table of contents when a user opens it. Potentially, the information type will also be a "switch" that can be controlled programmatically. For example, you might include questions in the installation script to find out how much computer experience a user has and set the table of contents to show only topics for that experience level.</p>
<p>
The benefit of this feature is fairly obvious for anyone who is creating user assistance, from online help to product support. The ability to control how a new user accesses your title has all kinds of interesting implications. It also has plenty of potential for other sorts of Web documents. Suppose you have created a zine to keep the technical staff in your company up to date on new Web developments. When the user "subscribes" to the zine, he or she could indicate high interest topics from a controlled list (which is mapped to the information types in your table of contents). A programmer, for example, might express interest in Java, programming trends, and Dilbert (you'd have to have Dilbert in a zine, after all!). When this programmer opens your zine, the table of contents might only show the topics they've indicated an interest in. The programmer could also choose to see all or selected other topics types through the browser interface (either a dialog box or a right-click menu).</p>
<p>
Currently, HTML Help includes five core information types-conceptual, procedural, reference, troubleshooting, and tips-but you can identify an unlimited number of information types for your project. You can also apply more than one information type to a topic (for example, procedural/beginner for a help file or programmer/Java for that zine).</p>
<h2>Window Handling</h2>
<p>
Unlike the document interfaces you currently see on the Web, HTML Help supports multiple, customizable windows, including popup windows. Authors have a great deal of control over the way windows function. Here are some examples:
<ul>
<li>
You can add or remove buttons or     menus if you don't want to use the default set.<br><br></li>
<li>
By default, HTML Help creates a small window in the upper right side of the screen (the traditional online help position, as in Figure 6). The author can adjust this window to any size or position (including the traditional Web full-screen view).<br><br></li>
<li>
The size and position of a window can be absolute or relative to the current screen resolution.<br><br></li>
<li>
Windows can autosize-that is, adjust to the content to the amount of content in the window so that you don't have lots of white space at the bottom of the window.<br><br></li>
<li>
Windows can be set to an "on top" state, which causes the window to remain open even when the user is doing something else in another open window (such as entering information in a dialog box or Web form).<br><br></li>
<li>
Windows can be sized to exactly fit a background bitmap (maybe in a window intended specifically for showing an illustration), so scroll bars won't appear.</li></ul>
<p><img src="HTMLHelp.fig06.gif"></p>
<p><b>Figure 6: HTML Help-created window</b></p>
<p>
HTML Help also supports popup windows. Popup windows actually look like small boxes, since they don't include a border or scrollbar. Popups are temporary windows; they disappear as soon as the user touches the keyboard or clicks the mouse button. Typically, popups are used for glossary terms or parenthetical remarks.
<p>
Context sensitivity maps the topics in a HTML Help title to the objects (fields, dialog boxes, toolbars buttons, and so on) in a software application. This feature has obvious benefits for help authors and developers. It also has potential importance for Web developers. You might, for example, automatically open product literature, computer-based training, reference documents, customer billing reports, and so forth through context sensitivity.
<p>
Unlike its predecessor, HTML Help is controlled through a DLL rather than an executable. For help authors (and users), this fact results in an immediate benefit: the help window "follows" the application it documents, rather than the window that happens to be active at the moment. Suppose, for example, you're working in Microsoft Excel, open help (which is set to the "on top" state), and then open Word. With WinHelp, the help for Microsoft Excel would now be open on top of the Word workspace. With HTML Help, the help is associated with the application, so when you switch to Word, the Microsoft Excel help system won't open over it.
<p>
For authors, this change also means that application developers have control over integrating HTML Help into software. For example, a developer might embed the table of contents window into the interface of the software, rather than opening the title as a separate window over the software.
<p>

<h1>Compressed HTML</h1>
<p>
With HTML Help, you can store all of the documents (or topics) in your title as separate HTML files, or you can compile them as a single file. The single file format has a number of benefits:
<ul>
<li>
Compressed files take up much less disk space than "loose" HTML files and graphics.<br><br></li>
<li>
Users don't have to manage large numbers of HTML files on their hard drives.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Microsoft plans to publish the compression format. However, compressed files can be encrypted to make them more secure. Microsoft has not yet released the details of the encryption format.</p>
<p>
Titles will be decompressed on the client side. Compression is also incremental, making it easier to update or modify the compressed information. </p>
<p>
The compressed format has not yet been proposed to W3C, but Microsoft intends to propose it once the sitemap format has been finalized and accepted.</p>
<p>
HTML Help is equipped with a graphical environment called the HTML Help Workshop (see Figure 7) for setting up the various components of your title, such as the table of contents, keyword indexes, windows, and so forth. In the Help Workshop, you can add the ActiveX control to your project (using a wizard), edit HTML files, set up the hierarchy of the table of contents, related keywords to topics, set up windows, and so forth.</p>
<p><img src="HTMLHelp.fig07.gif">
</p>
<p><b>Figure 7: HTML Help Workshop</b></p>
<p>
While the ActiveX control will be available for multiple platforms, Microsoft currently plans to limit the HTML Help Workshop to 32-bit Windows operating systems.</p>
<p>
Before its spring 1997 release, the HTML Help Workshop will be integrated with Trident, Microsoft's new technology that integrates HTML editing and browsing. A frustrating problem in HTML authoring is that HTML editors and Web browsers are often out of synch. Browsers typically support the latest version of HTML and leading-edge Web technology, while the editors are continually playing catchup (and often falling short). As a result, most Web authors use the editor for as much Web authoring as they can and then resort to opening the HTML code in a word processor, adding the unsupported code by hand, and crossing their fingers that the new code won't be stripped out when they open it in the editor again. Because Trident is both a browser and an editor, the authoring and viewing remain synchronized. If Trident supports a new technology or HTML level as a browser, it will simultaneously support this information as an editor.</p>
<p>
HTML Help Trident will include Trident's full-featured editor and a browser that supports both standard HTML and features specific to HTML Help, such as setting up the ActiveX control and handling windows.</p>
<h2>Third-party Authoring Tools</h2>
<p>
Windows help has long been supported by a highly competitive crop of third-party authoring tools that have traditionally added features to WinHelp and are likely to do the same for HTML Help. (Below is a list of vendors who have announced support for or are currently supporting HTML Help.)</p>
<p>
While most of these tools currently focus on supporting both WinHelp and HTML Help from a single source, they are more mature than most HTML editors in project handling and navigational features. In addition, these tools are likely to extend HTML Help, just as they have WinHelp. For example, a feature of WinHelp that HTML Help will not support is a library of about 100 macros that help authors have used to control the interface of their WinHelp systems-everything from starting up an application from a hotspot to controlling the browser interface. You can expect the HTML Help authoring tool vendors to recreate these capabilities using a Web standard technology, such as JScript or VBScript. You can also expect to see them extend HTML Help with ActiveX components.</p>
