<p>
Developing for Windows CE is very similar to developing for Windows 95 and Windows NT. Because development for Windows CE is done using the C/C++ programming language and a subset of the Win32 API, developers can apply their existing Windows knowledge and expertise to this new platform.  </p>
<p><font size=4><b>Development Tools for Windows CE</b></font></p>
<p>
<b>Windows CE Desktop Emulation Software Development Kit (SDK)</b></p>
<p>
With the Windows CE Desktop Emulation SDK, you're able to develop Windows CE applications right on your desktop! The SDK provides a complete environment for building applications, including desktop libraries, header files, many Windows CE–specific samples, and documentation. Using this SDK and a standard desktop compiler, you can build, debug, and run Windows CE apps on your desktop computer. The Windows CE Desktop Emulation SDK is available on the Microsoft Developer Network Online and can be downloaded from the Windows CE Developer Web site, <b>http://www.microsoft.com/windowsce/developer/.</b></p>
<p>
<b>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows CE</b></p>
<p>
Building Windows CE–based applications for the device requires the use of cross-compilers and other cross-platform tools developed for Windows CE. Now these cross-compilers and tools are available as an add-on package for Visual C++ version 5.0 (Professional and Enterprise Editions). Visual C++ for Windows CE includes cross-compilers, Windows CE Win32 libraries, remote debuggers, remote tools (Spy, Zoomin, RegEdit, MemView), and all of the Desktop Emulation SDK components described above. Taking advantage of the Visual C++ installable package architecture, these tools are all seamlessly integrated into Visual Studio 97, allowing you to edit code and resources, compile, link, download to a device, and run or debug all from within the integrated development environment.</p>
