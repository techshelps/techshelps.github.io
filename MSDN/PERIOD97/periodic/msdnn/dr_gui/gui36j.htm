<h1><a name="msdn_gui36j"></a>A special note: Sun's Espresso Man responds</h1>
<p>
<b>Note</b>   You might remember that Dr. GUI welcomed Sun's Q&amp;A guy, Espresso Man, a few months ago. Dr. GUI was gratified to get this letter in his inbox from Espresso Man (published with his permission, of course):</p>
<p>
<b>Dear Dr. GUI,</b></p>
<p>
I just wanted to thank you for the warm welcome you extended me upon my entry into the small community of &quot;Developer Newsletter Pundits.&quot; Giving out the Sun URL to your readers was a particularly gracious gesture.</p>
<p>
I am pleased you felt flattered when reading my column for the first time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;hopefully as flattered as Dr. Science was when someone pointed out an early column of yours.&nbsp;&nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>
As for myself, I have been a strictly Unix user/developer for many years, and my Microsoft Windows 95 learning only began 6 months ago when in answer to a question to my 8 year old, &quot;How do I turn this thing off?&quot; he replied, &quot;You click on <b>Start</b>.&quot;</p>
<p>
This approach to constructing a human interface was so thrillingly counterintuitive I was amazed it hadn't been adopted by at least one UNIX variant.</p>
<p>
So with my belated start in the PC world, I must confess to not having read your column until 14 people (at last count) came running in to point out the paragraph referring to me in your last issue. I can therefore only hope that your gender transformations weren't too painful (I had naively assumed that they weren't reversible), and as for the species transformation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well if this is <i>de rigueur</i> for us Developer News Pundits, then I may have to bow out earlier than I thought!</p>
<p>
Hoping this finds you in good health,<BR><i>Espresso Man</i></p>
<p>
<b>Dr. GUI responds:</b></p>
<p>
Thanks for the note—sending it was gracious of you. And though our companies don't seem to agree on every issue, the good doctor enjoys your sense of humor (not to mention your keen sense of U/I design—Dr. GUI remembers well explaining to his mom how to shut down a Windows 95 computer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.).</p>
<p>
About the gender and species transformations: they were no pain at all. That's what's so cool about software—just flip some bits and everything changes.</p>
<p>
Thanks again, and best of luck to you.</p>
