<p><font color="#000000" size="6" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Ask Dr. GUI #34</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">(He's rather frightened us with
his enthusiasm for Java. We think.)</font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana">May 1997</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">Many, many, many thanks to Dr.
GUI&#146;s chief specialist Saji Abraham, who is as of this
column a certified miracle worker. (Six more and we give him a
feast day!)</font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana">Dr. GUI Gets Wired (or Is
that Weird?) on Java</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">About this time last year, Dr.
GUI got Webbed. This year, Dr. GUI&#146;s been drinking
Java&trade; from a fire hose&#151;he just got back from Sun
Microsystem&#146;s annual JavaOne conference for Java programmers
and he&#146;s still wired. It was a busy week&#151;so busy that
Dr. GUI didn&#146;t even have any time for sightseeing or fun in
his favorite city, San Francisco. His diligence to his duties
paid off, however, and Dr. GUI has come back with a great
prognosis for the future of Java in our industry. But he also
diagnosed a severe pathological condition that will take all of
our efforts to cure. More on that later.</font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana">The Good News</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">You&#146;ll recall that the good
doctor has long been a fan of Java. Dr. GUI likes the elegance of
the language and the fact that his code will run anywhere
there&#146;s a Java Virtual Machine (VM). (It might run a little
slowly and it might not take full advantage of the platform, but
it&#146;ll run.) But the good doctor&#146;s also been frustrated
about the limitations of Java&#151;that the API hasn&#146;t
really delivered the functionality needed be to taken at all
seriously as a platform. (Thank goodness for COM, which allows
him to work around those limitations, at least on Win32®.) Dr.
GUI does as much coding as he can in Java, but given limitations
of speed and functionality, he can&#146;t do all of his surgery
in Java.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">The good news from JavaOne is
that the capabilities of Java are rapidly expanding, starting
with the soon-to-be-available-most-everywhere version 1.1.
Although the JavaSoft division of Sun Microsystems has not done
much to enhance Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), which is widely
regarded as the weakest part of Java, they have been working hard
on a number of very significant and important changes. In fact,
they&#146;ve added over 20 packages, containing well over 200
classes, to the Java Development Kit (JDK). The JDK is getting so
large, in fact, that JavaSoft is planning on offering
trimmed-down Java standards called &#147;Personal Java&#148; and
&#147;Embedded Java&#148; so that parts of the Java run time can
be implemented without huge memory requirements. (For instance,
&#147;Personal Java&#148; is supposed to take &#147;only&#148; 2
megabytes of memory.) Let it be noted that the good doctor is
concerned about these new standards (not to mention
&#147;Enterprise Java&#148;) fragmenting Java. After all, is it
really &#147;Write ONCE, Run Anywhere&trade;&#148; if it
won&#146;t run on my &#147;Personal Java&#148; set-top box?</font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana">New API from JavaSoft</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">These new classes address many
crucial issues for Java developers, such as internationalization,
components (via the JavaBeans&trade; component model), remote
method invocation, and more flexible security, including signed
applets using technology somewhat similar to Microsoft®
Authenticode&trade;. JavaBeans in particular is very cool. Sun
did a wonderful demo of Beans, including some very cool visual
development tools and Beans that had been wrapped as an
ActiveX&trade; control being used in all sorts of ActiveX
containers&#151;Microsoft Visual Basic®, Microsoft Excel, and
even Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0. It&#146;s interesting that
wrapping a Bean as an ActiveX control is the <i>only </i>way to
use it in a Web browser at this point, since other browsers
don&#146;t yet support Beans. (Yes, Dr. GUI knows that it&#146;s
possible to host a Bean that is also an Applet in any
Java-enabled browser, but that&#146;s hosting an applet, not just
any Bean.) Although this was an impressive demonstration of the
power of ActiveX, it&#146;s even more impressive to think of the
power you&#146;ll get when ActiveX controls and JavaBeans are
fully integrated in the next version of the Microsoft Win32
Virtual Machine for Java, currently in beta. (Read on.)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">JavaSoft promised future
advances in their 2- and 3-D imaging models, security, an
enterprise framework, and more for future releases. Given
JavaSoft&#146;s success with the 1.1 release, Dr. GUI has high
hopes that he won&#146;t be waiting long for more great Java
enhancements. And JavaSoft seems to be doing a good job hitting
functional areas that most developers need.</font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana">Putting Some Meat on AWT</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">There will be two approaches to
beefing up AWT, Java&#146;s windowing library. Sun announced the
Java Foundation Classes (JFC), which sounded like a rewrite of
Netscape&#146;s rather lackluster Internet Foundation Classes
(IFC). If you&#146;re developing in IFC, don&#146;t worry: there
will be a migration kit. (What fun!) Sun announced that they had
engineers from Netscape, IBM, and Sun working on JFC, and that
they&#146;d be out for beta by late summer. But frankly, I
wasn&#146;t impressed with either the functionality they
described (limited and inflexible compared with Microsoft&#146;s
Application Foundation Classes) nor the schedule (I want it <i>yesterday</i>!).
But the good doctor did like the pluggable look-and-feel features
of JFC.</font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana">What&#146;s New from
Microsoft</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">Dr. GUI was, however, most
impressed with Microsoft&#146;s Application Foundation Classes
(AFC) for Java. In fact, he saw a demo at Microsoft where a
Microsoft developer asked, &#147;When are you going to port this
stuff back to C++?&#148; When was the last time you saw C++
developers drooling over a Java API library? It&#146;s that good.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">There&#146;s a beta version of
AFC available now (check it out at </font><a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/pre-sdk/default.htm"><font
size="2" face="verdana">http://www.microsoft.com/java/pre-sdk/default.htm</font></a><font
size="2" face="verdana">), and the full documentation is
available as well (same place, click &#147;Packages and
Classes&#148; in the left pane). But don&#146;t take Dr.
GUI&#146;s word for it&#151;check Simson Garfinkel&#146;s article
in Packet (see</font><a
href="http://www.packet.com/packet/garfinkel/97/12/index2a.htm"><font
size="2" face="verdana">
http://www.packet.com/packet/garfinkel/97/12/index2a.htm</font></a><font
size="2" face="verdana">). Dr. GUI knows that when you compare
the two libraries for yourself you&#146;ll agree that AFC rocks.
And it&#146;s 100% Java code&#151;it&#146;ll run anyplace
there&#146;s a Java VM.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">In addition, the next version of
the Microsoft Win32 Virtual Machine for Java will support full
two-way interaction between ActiveX controls and Java Beans,
including visual controls. That means you can use a Java Bean
anywhere you can use an ActiveX control (such as Visual Basic,
Microsoft Visual C++®, Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel,
Microsoft Word, Delphi, and so on) and that you can use an
ActiveX control written in any language anywhere you can use a
Java component. (Check out a Java version of Internet Explorer at
</font><a
href="http://www.packet.com/packet/garfinkel/97/12/code.html"><font
size="2" face="verdana">http://www.packet.com/packet/garfinkel/97/12/code.html</font></a><font
size="2" face="verdana">. Only 150 lines of Java with
AFC&#151;and the help of the IE Web browser ActiveX control.) The
AFC library is based on standard Java/AWT
Container/Component/LayoutManager architecture, and ActiveX
controls appear in the Java world as Components. That means you
can even build a tree or list control populated with ActiveX
controls&#151;even Visual Basic controls or Web browsers! Note
that this VM support is completely separate from AFC&#151;AFC is
100% cross-platform. This VM is also in beta now (you&#146;ll
find it at </font><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/"><font
size="2" face="verdana">http://www.microsoft.com/java/</font></a><font
size="2" face="verdana">). You can start developing for both it
and AFC today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">Finally, check out AFC
Enterprise Libraries (</font><a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/"><font size="2"
face="verdana">http://www.microsoft.com/java/</font></a><font
size="2" face="verdana">). Some of the features, such as
transaction processing services, are in beta now. Other features,
such as advanced database access, directory services, enterprise
management services, and object interoperability using DCOM, will
be in beta soon and will be shipping sometime in the second half
of this year. And if you&#146;re developing Java apps now,
don&#146;t miss J/Advantage (also at </font><a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/"><font size="2"
face="verdana">http://www.microsoft.com/java/</font></a><font
size="2" face="verdana">).</font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana">Java Is Real!</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">The key message is that, more
than ever before, Java is a language and run-time system in which
you can get real work done&#151;all while enhancing the
investment in the programs you write because they&#146;ll run in
many different environments without requiring recompilation. (Dr.
GUI never has liked porting code except for MFC apps, which
almost port themselves.) If you haven&#146;t paid attention to
Java before, Dr. GUI recommends doing so now&#151;there are now
many applications for which Java is the smartest choice for you <i>and</i>
your customers. But make no mistake about it: Java will <i>always</i>
be slower than good C++ code (the Sun attitude of &#147;it&#146;s
more important to have a secure system than a fast system&#148;
ensures this). And cross-platform programs truly are &#147;lowest
common denominator&#148; programs, no matter how much the bottom
is raised&#151;they will never be able to take advantage of all
of the great features of every platform. Despite these
limitations, there are many applications for which Java is the
right choice, so Java is always worth considering and choosing
when it makes good sense. And with the rapid advances in Java
programming libraries and tools, it makes sense more and more
often.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana"><b>The Java Religion</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">Java has, for better or worse,
transcended being a mere technology and has become a religion.
The leading school of thought in this religion is the &#147;100%
Pure Java&#148; movement (see </font><a
href="http://java.sun.com/100percent/"><font size="2"
face="verdana">http://java.sun.com/100percent/</font></a><font
size="2" face="verdana">), which asks developers to &#147;take
the pledge&#148; to write only 100% Pure Java. (They even give
out &#147;take the pledge&#148; buttons you can wear.) This
religion preaches salvation through its mantra, &#147;Write Once,
Run Anywhere.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana"><b>The Key Question</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">The whole time he was at the
conference, Dr. GUI was dying for someone to ask the key
pertinent question: &#147;I&#146;ve got customers today who need
functionality that&#146;s not provided in &#145;100% Pure
Java.&#146; They want the solutions now&#151;I can&#146;t wait
for the next release. If I don&#146;t serve them, my competitors
will. What does Sun say I should do?&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">Dr. GUI really wanted to hear
the answer to that one. It would have spoken volumes about the
speaker&#146;s view of developers and customers. (The good doctor
would have asked himself, but he considers it too rude at another
company&#146;s conference.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Dr. GUI on Programming
Religion</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">Dr. GUI loves Java, the
technology; but he rejects Java, the religion. If, for
programming&#146;s sake, Dr. GUI &#147;needs&#148; to &#147;get
religion,&#148; then the good doctor&#146;s first commandment
will be this: &#147;Serve thy customer to the best of thy
ability.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">If customers need 100% Pure
Java, great. If they need &#147;99 44/100% Pure Ivory Java,&#148;
that&#146;s fine, too. Dr. GUI doesn&#146;t care what color the
computer is as long as it runs code. Don&#146;t you think that
what developers and customers <i>really </i>need is &#147;100% <i>useful
</i>Java,&#148; not a religious experience? Wouldn&#146;t it be
better to work together to make Java 100% useful?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">As he absorbed the religious
fervor surrounding the conference, it occurred to Dr. GUI that
with just one simple letter change, he <i>could</i> become Fr.
GUI (hey, he&#146;s been a <i>toaster</i>&#151;what&#146;s a
religious conversion compared to<b> </b><i>that</i>?). He quickly
rejected that notion, preferring to remain among the laity. Dr.
GUI nonetheless mused that, if he were to write a closing prayer
for the conference, he would take as his theme, &#147;Can&#146;t
we all just get along?&#148;</font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana">Welcome, Espresso Man!</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">On a lighter note, Dr. GUI would
like to welcome his new colleague, Espresso Man. You can check
out his &#147;Ask Espresso Man&#148; column, which started in the
second issue of <i>Sun Developer News</i> (online at </font><a
href="http://www.sun.com/developers/devnews/"><font size="2"
face="verdana">http://www.sun.com/developers/devnews/</font></a><font
size="2" face="verdana">). Dr. GUI is indeed sincerely flattered
(as is MSDN&#146;s <i>Developer Network News</i>), although Dr.
GUI notes that he has a lead of two gender transformations and a
species transformation (see <i>Developer Network News, </i>January
1996) on Espresso Man. </font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana">Questions!</font></h2>
