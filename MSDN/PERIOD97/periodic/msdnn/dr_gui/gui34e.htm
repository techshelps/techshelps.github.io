<h2><font size="2" face="verdana">Dear Dr. GUI, </font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">I&#146;ve been trying to
replicate functionality I&#146;ve seen in Microsoft Word 7.0. In
the File Locations tab under Tools/Options, there is a button
that allows the user to set a folder to store certain types of
files. The dialog that appears looks and smells like it could be
a common dialog, but I have not been able to find access to it.
The dialog allows folder selection, but not file
selection&#151;like a cousin of the Open File dialog. Does such a
common dialog exist? If so, can I access it from Visual Basic
4.0? </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">Thank you, <br>
<i>Tom Bellucco</i></font></p>

<h2><font size="2" face="verdana">Dr. GUI replies:</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">I seem to be spending a lot of
time this column finding things for folks. I&#146;m beginning to
feel like St. Anthony.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">Anyway, back down to earth: In
Visual Basic (at least in version 5.0&#151;Dr. GUI has upgraded
and he&#146;s/she&#146;s/it&#146;s not going back), you can use a
<b>DirListBox </b>control to access similar functionality. (You
can always put it on another form if you like.) In the Windows
API, there isn&#146;t a common dialog as such, but there is an
API, <b>SHBrowseForFolder</b>, which is very easy to use. See the
Windows SDK documentation for details.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="verdana">In Java, you&#146;ll need to
write a wrapper (preferably a COM object) for the Win32 API
function or write the functionality yourself in Java. Or write an
ActiveX control in Visual Basic that does the job, then use it in
your Java application.</font></p>
