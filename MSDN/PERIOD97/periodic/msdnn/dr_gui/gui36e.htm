<h1><a name="msdn_gui36e"></a>I've got a pain in the short file names</h1>
<p>
<b>Hello Dr. GUI!</b></p>
<p>
I read about your T-shirt prize for the questions selected by you. I am mailing this to you with a hope of getting my doubt cleared and getting a T-shirt from you.</p>
<p>
I have a question about long and short filenames.</p>
<p>
Can I assign my own value to the long file name without allowing the operating system to assign its own value while creating a new file? Can I change the long file name and short file name for an existing file? For example: </p>
<p>
What I want is, the long file name may be &quot;LONGTESTFILENAME.DOC&quot; and the corresponding short file name should be &quot;FILE1.DOC&quot;.</p>
<p>
What the operating system might do is, the long file name is &quot;LONGTESTFILENAME.DOC&quot; and the short file name is  &quot;LONGTE~1.DOC&quot;.</p>
<p>
If yes, how can I do it?</p>
<p>
I hope the question is clear to you.</p>
<p>
Regards,<BR><i>Velan A. Senthil</i> </p>

<b>Dr. GUI replies:</b></p>
<p>
Even with modern medicine, there are some problems Dr. GUI can't solve—and this is one of them. Thankfully, our inability to cure this condition won't be fatal to the patient.</p>
<p>
The short file name (SFN) is generated by the operating system and there is no way to change its algorithm nor to assign your own SFN.</p>
<p>
This isn't what you wanted, but you can turn off short file name generation altogether by editing a registry key. This can lead to increased directory enumeration performance. For more information see &quot;How to Disable the 8.3 Name Creation on NTFS Partitions&quot; (MSDN Library, Knowledge Base article Q12100). The good doctor normally doesn't recommend this, since turning off short file names will prevent 16-bit Windows and MS-DOS programs from accessing files with long names.</p>
