<p><font color="#000000" size="6" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Ask Dr. GUI #33</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(He recently walked eight
miles in a blizzard to deliver a keg of hot java to stranded
developers.)</font></p>
    <h2><font size="2" face="Verdana">February 1997</font></h2>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dr. GUI's specialists for
    this column:<br>
    Saji Abraham<br>
    Brad Van Ee<br>
    Rick Caudle</font></p>
    <h2><font size="2" face="Verdana">Settling in for a cold,
    wet winter</font></h2>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As you may have heard,
    Seattle had some hard weather this winter&#151;hard by
    anyone's standards, not just by the standards of those who
    almost never see snow. At one point, there was so much snow
    that Dr. GUI couldn't get to the code hospital to perform
    bug-ectomies, let alone to Palm Springs or Las Vegas.
    (Besides, the good doctor remembers the last time he was in
    Las Vegas, although he doesn't remember getting back.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In any case, Dr. GUI was
    stuck at home, burning up his hard-earned vacation time
    sloshing around in weather that made it difficult to walk,
    let alone drive. (Unlike a few folks at Microsoft, Dr. GUI
    doesn't drive a HumVee.) What else could he do except curl up
    with a cup of Java, visit warmer places on the Web, and do
    what the good doctor does best: hacking code. The snow is
    long gone now, but Dr. GUI's glad to have played with some of
    Microsoft's cool, relatively new technologies that have
    become the apple of the good doctor's eye.</font></p>
    <h2><font size="2" face="Verdana">Windows CE</font></h2>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">What green-blooded Microsoft
    fan could possibly avoid getting one of the hot new Windows
    CE handheld computers? Dr. GUI was lucky enough to find one
    in his stocking this year. With the snow falling furiously,
    he had plenty of time to download the Windows CE SDK beta and
    try it out.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Programming for Windows CE
    is fun&#151;it combines the simplicity of the good old days
    of Windows 3.<i>x</i> with the sophistication of a 32-bit
    multitasking OS. And the SDK even includes an emulator that
    will run on your desktop PC, so you can try it out even if
    you don't own a handheld PC.</font></p>
    <h2><font size="2" face="Verdana">Java&#151;not just for
    breakfast anymore</font></h2>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dr. GUI's finally had some
    time to sit down with Microsoft Visual J++. Learning Java is
    a little harder than I thought it would be: It's not really
    accurate to view Java as just C++ minus a few features. The
    semantics of object references takes some getting used to, as
    does not having to worry about freeing memory. And a lot of
    stuff is just plain different than C++ and Windows&#151;some
    stuff is harder, some stuff is easier.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But now that he's used to
    it, Dr. GUI once again likes Java. It's fun to program in a
    language where threads are part of the normal way of doing
    business. And the weakest part of Java, the Abstract
    Windowing Toolkit (AWT), is about to get some help from
    Microsoft's new Application Foundation Classes for
    Java&#151;a new, cross-platform all-Java class library. Check
    it out at </font><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/"><font
    size="2" face="Verdana"><u>http://www.microsoft.com/java/</u></font></a><font
    size="2" face="Verdana">. While you're there, check out the
    cool tools and documentation in the Microsoft SDK for Java.
    (You can also write Windows NT services in Java with the
    latest version of the SDK.) And check out the Visual J++ site
    at </font><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualj/"><font
    size="2" face="Verdana"><u>http://www.microsoft.com/visualj/</u></font></a><font
    size="2" face="Verdana">, too!</font></p>
    <h2><font size="2" face="Verdana">Visual Studio 97</font></h2>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But the bulk of Dr. GUI's
    playtime has been spent on Microsoft Visual Studio 97&#151;a
    bundle of Visual C++, Visual Basic, Visual FoxPro, Visual
    J++, Dr. GUI's beloved MSDN Library (single edition), and the
    new Visual InterDev, a tool that makes server-side scripting
    and database access a snap. Visual InterDev is new; the rest
    of the tools are new versions with significant improvements
    over previous versions. For example, Dr. GUI is particularly
    enamored of the following:</font></p>
    
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Visual Basic 5.0's
        support for native code (up to 20 times faster) and
        ability to create ActiveX controls and documents.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Visual C++'s nifty new
        compiler (faster code by just recompiling) and the
        ActiveX Template Library, which now supports creation of
        ActiveX controls with full UI (and makes it easy with
        Wizards).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Visual J++'s new Java to
        COM and database wizards.</font></p>
    
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Having all these tools
    together in one place and at one price is great&#151;and Dr.
    GUI's projects, especially Web projects, have almost always
    been done in multiple languages lately. Visual Studio 97 is
    just what the doctor ordered!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The bad weather has also
    made answering questions a bit harder, but we do have a few
    for you.</font></p>
