    <h2><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dear Dr. GUI:</font></h2>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am writing an application
    that saves data to a comma-delimited file. I want to be able
    to export this data to Microsoft Excel so that the user can
    do something useful with it. I am writing the application in
    C++. I have tried using <b>WinExec</b>, <b>CreateProcess</b>,
    and <b>SearchPath</b> to locate and run Microsoft Excel. None
    of these system calls are able to find Excel because it is
    not in the path. (Although in Windows 95, I can start Excel
    from &quot;Start-Run&quot; and it can find Excel.) Is there a
    generic way to find out if Excel is on the computer and where
    it is located?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i>Jason Carnahan</i></font></p>
    <h2><font size="2" face="verdana">Dr. GUI replies:</font></h2>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Oy! Another location and
    forwarding question! Dr. GUI isn't a mail service. He's not
    even sure he's a male service sometimes. Oops. Another
    programming question.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, Dr. GUI is pleased to
    say that he has a most Excel-lent way to start up Microsoft
    Excel, regardless of where it's located.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The <b>ShellExecute</b>
    function in the Microsoft Platform SDK (formerly called the
    Win32 SDK) will fire off Microsoft Excel (or any other
    application). Better yet, you can even pass it the filename
    of a <i>document</i>, and Microsoft Excel will load up that
    document's application automatically. In your case, if you do
    the following:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">ShellExecute(&lt;Window
    handle&gt;, NULL, &quot;Excel&quot;, NULL, NULL,
    SW_SHOWNORMAL);</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">and if Microsoft Excel is
    properly installed on the user's system, then Microsoft Excel
    will load. (You'll want to do some error checking to make
    sure it loaded okay, of course.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you really want to, you
    can also find the location of the Microsoft Excel .exe file
    by using the Windows API <b>FindExecutable</b>. But for most
    uses, using <b>ShellExecute</b> is easier.</font></p>
