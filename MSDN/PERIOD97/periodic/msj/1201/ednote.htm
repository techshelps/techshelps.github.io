    unfolds</font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">
    before us here at <i>MSJ</i>, it&#146;s time to look forward
    and make some predictions for the new year. While this is not
    a feat beyond the ability of <i>MSJ</i>&#146;s crack team of
    scientists, programmers, and creative types, a recent visit
    to the Win32 PDC down at Long Beach made things a little
    easier.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Microsoft
    Internet Studio will finally provide that all-in-one high-end
    Web development tool we&#146;ve been looking for on the
    software shelves for months. In addition to creating HTML
    scripts and plopping ActiveX components down on your pages,
    Internet Studio also makes it easy to get database contents
    transcribed on-the-fly into customer-specific HTML pages. For
    example, if you take a look at the online movie guide
    http://www.777film.com, you will see that it is really a
    giant movie database tailored to the customer&#146;s
    particular needs. With Internet Studio, you can write such
    customizable database Web apps using templates and wizards.
    We look forward to the proliferation of database-derived Web
    pages. Expect to read plenty more about Internet Studio in
    the pages of both <i>MSJ</i> and our sister publication <i>MIND</i>
    in the coming year.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Visual Basic
    will find even more use in 1997, as it becomes the best front
    end to Microsoft&#146;s new distributed transaction server
    technology, codenamed Viper. Viper changes the client-server
    architecture many of us work with today and replaces it with
    a three-tiered architecture. Viper is the middle tier, acting
    as a liaison between the client front ends and the data store
    back ends. Viper embodies the business rules in its middle
    tier (currently implemented as stored procedures on the back
    end) via lightweight COM objects, and easily uses OLE DB
    (discussed in the July 1996 issue) to communicate with the
    database back end. Although you can use any COM-based tool to
    write front ends and business rule components, Visual Basic
    makes it easy to write COM objects, hence our expectations of
    even more adopters of this language. Look for intense Viper
    coverage in <i>MSJ</i> during the coming months, including
    tips on making the paradigm shift of moving the business
    rules from the back end to the middle tier. You&#146;ll also
    see ramped-up coverage of Visual Basic and all its hybrids,
    since it is becoming the language of choice for distributed
    computing.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Voice
    recognition will start to work well this year. Animated,
    Microsoft Bob-like assistants will fly around your Web pages
    and give you advice via the spoken word. And you will be able
    to speak back to them, asking them such questions as
    &quot;What town did Newt Gingrich retire to?&quot;,
    &quot;Tickets to &#145;Rent&#146; aren&#146;t available until
    <i>when</i>?&quot;, and &quot;Could you make that a
    double-tall two percent no-lid with just a dash of foam on
    top?&quot; Provided the current page in your browser is
    programmed to answer political trivia, order Broadway
    tickets, or handle espresso orders to go, chances are you
    will get information at your fingertips without touching the
    keyboard.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Of course,
    there are plenty of other topics you&#146;ll read about in <i>MSJ
    </i>this year, and plenty of topics won&#146;t make the cut.
    We&#146;ll keep up our breakneck coverage of ActiveX
    technologies, Java and Visual J++, Win32, and Windows NT 5.0,
    as well as continue our theoretical discussions, like Allen
    Holub&#146;s MFC series that concludes in this issue. Topics
    that won&#146;t make the cut? That seven-part series on
    migrating Web apps from Internet Explorer to Navigator comes
    to mind. Same goes for &quot;Getting Something Out of
    Nothing: NC Hard Disk Compression and You.&quot; And you
    won&#146;t see Dr. Ruth doing a new column on ActiveSex
    controls anytime in the future. Here&#146;s wishing you good
    ActiveX in 1997! &#151;D.E.</font></p>
