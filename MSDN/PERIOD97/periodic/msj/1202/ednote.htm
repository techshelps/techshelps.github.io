<p><font color="#000000" size="6" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Editor&#146;s
Note</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="7" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">C</font><font
color="#000000" size="4" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">ameras,
TVs, and DVDs, oh my!</font><font color="#000000" size="2"
face="verdana,arial,helvetica"> No, not the Consumer Electronics
Show, but Comdex. Yes, Windows CE was everywhere (you read about
it here first as &quot;Pegasus&quot;), and Microsoft&#146;s
gigunda booth was literally impossible to avoid, but we here at <i>MSJ</i>
thought we&#146;d take a look at the other interesting stuff at
Comdex. The stuff that interests the techno-gadget hound in all
of us.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Digital
cameras were clearly the Comdex rage. While consumers are going
to be happily taking digital snapshots of their baby&#146;s first
spitup and sending the images to their parents over the Internet,
Web page creators are going to be taking photos of their products
and getting them on Web pages in much less time (and without
fussing around with a scanner). The latest cameras can store
dozens of 640</font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Symbol">´</font><font
color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">480
24-bit JPEGs in their built-in RAM. Minolta&#146;s camera even
has a detachable lens on a three-foot cord that approaches a
coolness factor seen only in James Bond movies. All of the
manufacturer&#146;s cameras have LCD preview screens so you can
see how your picture will look, and you can scroll through the
pictures stored in the camera, deleting ones you&#146;ve decided
weren&#146;t really that appealing&#151;we had to delete an
incriminating picture of our rental car bouncing off a concrete
median while we were looking up at the Stratosphere&#146;s
barf-o-rama ride.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">And
those flat panel displays! We saw 20-inch full-color 1024</font><font
color="#000000" size="2" face="Symbol">´</font><font
color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">768
backlit LCD displays everywhere. To up the ante, Pioneer and NEC
were showing off prototype 42-inch full-color gas plasma
displays. Provided you&#146;ve got ten grand worth of casino
chips in your pocket, you too can have a <i>really</i> large flat
panel computer display, or a TV set that you can hang on the
wall. Perfect for spotting Dr. Ruth or Elvis in those wedding
videos from Geekfest (held where else&#151;in the Little Chapel
of the Flowers).</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">DVD
has been the talk of the town for a couple years now, and there
was no shortage of them at Comdex&#151;but none were for sale.
While lawyers from Hollywood, the computer industry, and the DVD
manufacturers duke it out over piracy prevention, we were treated
to one of three movies showing in practically every hardware
manufacturer&#146;s booth. Take your pick: <i>Jurassic Park</i>,<i>
Waterworld</i>,<i> </i>or<i> Terminator 2</i>. Maybe by Spring
Comdex we&#146;ll actually be able to buy one.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">So
what&#146;s up with Comdex looking more like Sears than Computer
City? The final acceptance by consumers of computer technology in
the home comes to mind, with the Internet leading the way. We saw
Sony&#146;s WebTV on the right and palm-sized 8GB hard drives on
the left. The organizers of Comdex realize this, as the Spring
Comdex is now coupled with the Consumer Electronics Show, Windows
World, and Expo Comm (a telecommunications convention).</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">We
know we&#146;re speaking for the geek community as a whole when
we ask: what&#146;s with this trend of blowing up obsolete Las
Vegas hotels just a couple days after Comdex is over? This year
the Sands went down in a giant cloud of dust (although their Web
site at http://www.sands.com lives on!). Not too long ago the
Landmark was blown up right after the convention. Some exhibitor
should find out about the next demolition and pay off the owners
to schedule it during Comdex. Of course, the name of the
exhibitor&#146;s fiercest competitor would have to be painted on
the building. Sell tickets. We&#146;d love to watch. &#151;D.E.</font><font
