<p>
Use this dialog box to resolve a delayed action that is interfering with your adding items to the source control server. The items you deleted locally were not deleted on the source control server (the deleting action was delayed). These deleted items match names with the items you are trying to add now.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Items</h3>
<p>
Displays a list of the items that are in conflict with your current action, adding an item to source control. The items listed were deleted locally, but not deleted on the source control server. The names of these locally deleted items match the names of the items you are trying to add to the source control server.</p>
<h3>Push Delete</h3>
<p>
Deletes from the source control server the items listed in the Items box. Afterward, you will be prompted to continue with your original action to add items.</p>
<h3>Allow Conflict</h3>
<p>
Proceeds with the source control action, which may overwrite or change the items listed in the Items box. This action ignores any delayed actions that were not pushed to the server. Also, since you are ignoring this delayed action, the development environment will no longer keep a record of it. Next, you will continue with adding items to source control.</p>
