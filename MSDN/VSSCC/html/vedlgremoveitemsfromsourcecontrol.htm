<p>
Use this dialog box to delete an item from source control through the Microsoft development environment. Items selected with a check mark will be deleted from the source control server's database. For best results, remove items through the development environment instead of through the source control program. This allows the development environment to keep a record of the items in your project.</p>
<p>
You cannot remove entire projects or entire solutions from the source control database with this dialog box. For details on removing a source control project in the source control program, see your source control documentation.</p>
<p>
If you lost a connection to your project or solution in source control because the project or solution was branched, you can reconnect using the Change/Set Connection dialog box.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Items</h3>
<p>
Displays a list of the items based on your current selection in the Project Explorer (in the development environment). Select the box next to the items you wish to remove from source control and a check mark will appear next to the item. You can click Check All to select all of the items at once.</p>
<p>
This box displays the first level of folders and contents to which you can apply these operations. To see additional items contained within subfolders, click Recurse. Items contained within a subfolder are not removed from source control unless they are displayed individually in the Items box and selected with a check mark.</p>
<h3>Check All</h3>
<p>
Selects with a check mark all of the items visible in the Items box. To see additional subfolders and levels of items, click Recurse. Only items that are visible in the Items box and are shown with a check mark are removed from source control.</p>
<h3>Recurse</h3>
<p>
Forces items to be displayed in subfolders in the Items box. You can then select these items for source control actions.</p>
<p>
By default, the Items box displays only the first level of items contained in the Project Explorer for the development environment. Clicking Recurse displays all of the subfolders and all of their items for any remaining levels of depth in the directory tree, as shown in the Project Explorer. You can then select additional items for actions in source control.</p>
<h3>Advanced</h3>
<p>
Displays more options on adding items to source control. Your source control program supplies these options.</p>
