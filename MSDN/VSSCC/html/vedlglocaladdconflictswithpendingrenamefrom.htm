<p>
Use this dialog box to resolve a situation that is interfering with adding items to source control. The items you renamed locally were not renamed on the source control server (the renaming action was deferred). These renamed items have the same names as&nbsp; the items you are trying to add now.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Items</h3>
<p>
Displays a list of the items that are in conflict with your current action. These items were renamed locally, but not renamed on the source control server. The source control database names for these items match the names of the items you are trying to add to the source control server.</p>
<h3>Push Rename</h3>
<p>
Renames the source control server items to match the list in the Items box. Afterward, you will be prompted to continue with your original action to add items.</p>
<h3>Allow Conflict</h3>
<p>
Proceeds with the source control action, which may overwrite or change the items on the source control server. These items are listed by their local names in the Items box. This action ignores any delayed actions that were not pushed to the server. Also, since you are ignoring this delayed action, the development environment will no longer keep a record of it.</p>
