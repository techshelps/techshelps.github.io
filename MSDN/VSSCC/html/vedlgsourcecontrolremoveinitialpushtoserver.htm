<p>
Use this dialog box to control when an item is removed from the source control server. The Items box lists the items that were removed from the local machine. You can remove these items from the source control server or delay the action.</p>
<p>
If you delay the removal, the development environment will remind you that there are deleted items that are not pushed to the source control server. You can also choose to do nothing, and keep the items on the source control server.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Warning</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add your items to the master source control server when the other people sharing that database expect the addition of the item. If other team members are working on the same items as you are, delaying an action to an item may result in conflicting changes later.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Items</h3>
<p>
Displays the locally deleted items. Click box next to the items you wish to delete on the source control server, based on the button you choose (Add Now, Remind Later, or Do Nothing). A check mark will appear next to selected items.</p>
<h3>Remove Now</h3>
<p>
Deletes the items selected with check marks in the Items box. This action deletes the same items on the source control server that were deleted on your local machine, so that the contents of the solution will match in both places.</p>
<p>
You will be reminded later about adding any items you did not select with a check mark in the Items box.</p>
<h3>Remind Later</h3>
<p>
Delays deleting the items from the source control server until you are reminded again. To select specific items to remove from the server, click the items to remove, and then click Remove Now.</p>
<p>
Push reminders occur when a project is pushed. Push actions are Check In to Source Control and Add to Source Control. This is the default setting for reminder dialog boxes. You can change the timing of the dialog boxes by changing the options listed in the Source Control page (on the Tools menu, click Options, and then expand the Environment node and click the Source Control node).</p>
<h3>Do Nothing</h3>
<p>
Leaves all of the items as they are in both places. This means that a local copy of the item is not removed in the source control server. You will not be prompted with any more reminders.</p>
<h3>Don't show initial push dialog boxes</h3>
<p>
Suppresses any more instances of the Push Remove to Server dialog box. You can choose whether the development environment automatically delays the action (reminding you later), or never reminds you at all.</p>
<p>
You can enable this dialog box again by changing the options listed in the Source Control page (on the Tools menu, click Options, and then expand the Environment node and click the Source Control node).
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Always Remind — Choose this if you would like the development environment to always defer the action and remind you later. This means that if you delete items in the development environment, you will not be immediately prompted, and the environment will automatically delay the deletion to source control (reminding you later). You will be reminded to complete the action when you do the following push actions: Check In and Add to Source Control.<br><br></li>
<li>
Always Do Nothing — Choose this if you would like the development environment to do nothing with respect to source control. This means that if you delete items in the development environment, you will not be prompted, and the environment will not push the changes to the source control server's database.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Comment</h3>
<p>
Provides a place to enter comments. If your source control program is Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Visual SourceSafe™, you can type up to 4,095 characters.</p>
<h3>Advanced</h3>
<p>
Displays more options on adding items to source control. Your source control program supplies these options.</p>
