<p>
Use this dialog box to undo a check out of a solution, project, or individual item from source control. Items selected with a check mark in the Items box are returned to the state they were in before you checked them out.</p>
<p>
Undoing a check out returns the item to read-only status in source control. No changes are saved to the source control database. The item returns to its condition and version before you checked it out.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Items</h3>
<p>
Displays a list of the items based on your current selection in the Project Explorer (in the development environment). Select the box next to the items you wish to undo. A check mark will appear next to the item. You can click Check All to select all of the items at once.</p>
<p>
This box displays the first level of folders and contents to which you can apply these operations. To see additional items contained within subfolders, click Recurse. Items contained within a subfolder are not undone for their check out unless they are displayed individually in the Items box and selected with a check mark.</p>
<h3>Check All</h3>
<p>
Selects with a check mark all of the items visible in the Items box. To see additional subfolders and levels of items, click Recurse. Only items that are visible in the Items box and are shown with a check mark are affected by your action in this dialog box.</p>
<h3>Recurse</h3>
<p>
Forces items to be displayed in subfolders in the Items box. You can then select these items for source control actions.</p>
<p>
By default, the Items box displays only the first level of items contained in the Project Explorer for the development environment. Clicking Recurse displays all of the subfolders and all of their items for any remaining levels of depth in the directory tree, as shown in the Project Explorer. You can then select additional items for actions in source control.</p>
<h3>Don't show this dialog box again</h3>
<p>
Suppresses any more instances of the Undo Check Out dialog box. Undo Check Out becomes a direct command on the environment menus. You will not be able to add comments or use advanced options until you enable this dialog box again.</p>
<p>
You can enable this dialog box again by changing the options listed in the Source Control page (on the Tools menu, click Options, and then expand the Environment node and click the Source Control node).</p>
<h3>Advanced</h3>
<p>
Displays more options on adding items to source control. Your source control program supplies these options.</p>
