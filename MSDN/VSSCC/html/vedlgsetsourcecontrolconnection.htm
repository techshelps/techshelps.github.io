<p>
Use this dialog box to change the reference location of the source control database/server that you are using. This connection may be interrupted from a project or solution branch on the source control server or from network troubles. You can point the Microsoft development environment to the new location with the Change/Set Connection button.</p>
<p>
You can also use this dialog box to tell the development environment when you are working offline (not connected to the source control database/server). This can be intentional, such as when you are working remotely on a laptop, or accidental, as when a network connection breaks.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Change Selected Projects to</h3>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Work Offline — Acknowledges a disconnection from the source control server. Click this if your connection to the source control server is lost or you wish to work remotely. You can change back to working online by using the Set Connection menu command on the Source Control menu item.<br><br></li>
<li>
Work Online — Restores your connection with the source control database/server.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Change/Set Connection</h3>
<p>
Displays the Login or Browse dialog box supplied by your source control program.</p>
<h3>Apply changes to other projects with similar connections</h3>
<p>
Applies your changes to projects that share the same source control property types. There are two types of projects: web projects and everything else. Web projects are projects similar to Visual InterDev™ projects. Everything else can be Visual J++™, database, utility, distribution unit and other kinds of projects. </p>
<p>
If you are changing your source control connection to work online or offline, then checking this box will apply the changes to the similar types of projects, Web or otherwise.</p>
<p>
If you are changing your source control settings, project location, database, or other process by clicking Set/Change Connection, then checking this box applies these changes to a much more specific set of projects. This will include projects that were added to source control together at once, usually through the feature that adds the whole solution at once (in the Initial Add to Source Control dialog box).</p>
