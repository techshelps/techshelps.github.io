<p>
Use this dialog box to resolve a situation that is interfering with your action to remove items. The items you deleted locally were not deleted on the source control server. These deleted items match the items you renamed earlier (the renaming was local, and the renaming action to source control was deferred).</p>
<p>
Instead of renaming the items on the source control server and then deleting them, you can choose to delete them with the Remove Now option on this dialog box.</p>
<p>
The Items box lists the items that you deleted locally. These items were also renamed locally, but the renamed items were not updated on the source control server (the renaming was deferred). The items are listed by their new local names.</p>
<p>
If you delay the deletion, the development environment will remind you that there are deleted items that are not pushed to the source control server. You can also choose to do nothing, and keep the items on the source control server.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Warning</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add your items to the master source control server when the other people sharing that database expect the addition of the item. If other team members are working on the same items as you are, delaying an action to an item may result in conflicting changes later.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Items</h3>
<p>
Displays the deleted items from the local machine. Click the box next to the items you wish to delete on the source control server, based on the button you choose (Remove now, Remind later, or Do nothing). A check mark will appear next to selected items.</p>
<h3>Remove Now</h3>
<p>
Removes the items selected with check marks in the Items box from the source control server. This action ignores the deferred renaming of the items on the source control server and deletes them to match your local machine.</p>
<p>
You will be reminded later about removing any items you did not select with a check mark in the Items box.</p>
<h3>Remind Later</h3>
<p>
Delays deleting the items from the source control server until you are reminded. To select specific items to remove from the server, click the specific items to remove, and then click Remove Now.</p>
<p>
Reminders occur when a project is pushed. Push actions are Check In to Source Control and Add to Source Control. This is the default setting for reminder dialog boxes. You can change the timing of the dialog boxes by changing the options listed in the Source Control page (on the Tools menu, click Options, and then expand the Environment node and click the Source Control node).</p>
<h3>Do Nothing</h3>
<p>
Leaves all of the items as they are in both places. This means that the local copy of the item, removed locally, is not removed in the source control server. You will not be prompted with any more reminders.</p>
<h3>Don't show initial push dialog boxes</h3>
<p>
Suppresses any more instances of the Push Remove to Server (Incomplete Rename) dialog box. You can choose whether the development environment automatically delays the action (reminding you later), or never reminds you at all.</p>
<p>
You can enable this dialog box again by changing the options listed in the Source Control page (on the Tools menu, click Options, and then expand the Environment node and click the Source Control node).
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Always Remind — Choose this if you would like the development environment to always defer the action and remind you later. This means that if you delete items in the development environment, you will not be immediately prompted, and the environment will automatically delay the deletion to source control (reminding you later). You will be reminded to complete the action when you do the following push actions: Check In and Add to Source Control.<br><br></li>
<li>
Always Do Nothing — Choose this if you would like the development environment to do nothing with respect to source control. This means that if you delete items in the development environment, you will not be prompted, and the environment will not push the changes to the source control server's database.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Comment</h3>
<p>
Provides a place to enter comments. If your source control program is Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Visual SourceSafe™, you can type up to 4,095 characters.</p>
<h3>Advanced</h3>
<p>
Displays more options on adding items to source control. Your source control program supplies these options.</p>
