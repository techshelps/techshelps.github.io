<p>
Use this dialog box to resolve a situation that is interfering with your adding items to the local project or solution. The items you deleted locally were not deleted on the source control server (the deleting action was deferred). These deleted items match names with the items you are trying to add locally now.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Items</h3>
<p>
Displays a list of the items that are in conflict with your current action. These items were deleted locally, but not deleted on the source control server. The names of these locally deleted items match the names of the items you are trying to add to the local project or solution.</p>
<h3>Push Delete</h3>
<p>
Deletes from the source control server the items listed in the Items box. Afterward, you will be prompted to continue with your original action to add items locally.</p>
<h3>Skip Add</h3>
<p>
Cancels these selected items to Add to Source Control and ignores the outstanding delete items. The development environment will no longer keep a record of the deleted items (that were not deleted on the source control server).</p>
