<p>
Use this dialog box to resolve a situation that is interfering with your adding items to the source control server. The items you renamed locally were not renamed on the source control server (the renaming action was deferred). The outdated names of these items match the names of the items you are trying to add now.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Items</h3>
<p>
Displays a list of the items that are in conflict with your current action. These items were renamed locally, but not renamed on the source control server. The outdated names of these items match the names of the items you are trying to add to the source control server.</p>
<h3>Push Rename</h3>
<p>
Renames items in the Items box on the source control server to match the local names. Afterward, you will be prompted to continue with your original action to add items.</p>
<h3>Skip Add</h3>
<p>
Cancels the Add to Source Control action for the items listed and ignores the outstanding renamed items. Only the items listed in the Items box are skipped, not all of the possible items in your original Add to Source Control action.</p>
<h3>Add Anyway</h3>
<p>
Proceeds with the Add to Source Control action, which may overwrite or change the items listed in the Items box. This action ignores any delayed actions that were not pushed to the server. Also, since you are ignoring this delayed action, the development environment will no longer keep a record of it.</p>
