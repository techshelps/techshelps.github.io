<p>
Use this dialog box to control when an item is renamed on the source control server. The Items box lists the items that were renamed on the local machine. You can rename these items on the source control server or continue to delay the action.</p>
<p>
If you delay the renaming, the development environment will continue to remind you that there are renamed items that are not pushed to the source control server. You can also choose to do nothing, and keep the items on the source control server with their old names.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Warning</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add your items to the master source control server when the other people sharing that database expect the addition of the item. If other team members are working on the same items as you are, delaying an action to an item may result in conflicting changes later.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Items</h3>
<p>
Displays the renamed items on the local machine. Click the box next to the items you wish to rename on the source control server, based on the button you choose (Add Now, Remind Later, or Do Nothing). A check mark will appear next to selected items.</p>
<h3>Rename Now</h3>
<p>
Renames on the source control server the items selected with check marks in the Items box. This action pushes the new name of the item from the local machine to the source control server so that the contents of the solution will match in both places.</p>
<p>
You will be reminded later about renaming any items you did not select with a check mark in the Items box.</p>
<h3>Remind Later</h3>
<p>
Delays renaming the items from the source control server until you are reminded again. To select specific items to rename on the server, click the specific items to rename, and then click Rename Now.</p>
<p>
Reminders occur when a project is pushed. Push actions are Check In to Source Control and Add to Source Control. This is the default setting for reminder dialog boxes. You can change the timing of the dialog boxes by changing the options listed in the Source Control page (on the Tools menu, click Options, and then expand the Environment node and click the Source Control node).</p>
<h3>Do Nothing</h3>
<p>
Leaves all of the items as they are in both places. This means that a local copy of the item, renamed locally, is not renamed on the source control server. You will not be prompted with any more reminders.</p>
<h3>Don't show initial push dialog boxes</h3>
<p>
Suppresses any more instances of the Reminder to Push Rename to Server dialog box. You will not be able to add comments or use advanced options until you enable this dialog box again.</p>
<p>
You can enable this dialog box again by changing the options listed in the Source Control page (on the Tools menu, click Options, and then expand the Environment node and click the Source Control node).</p>
