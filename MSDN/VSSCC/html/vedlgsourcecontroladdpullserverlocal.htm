<p>
Use this dialog box to control when an item is added to your local machine from the source control server. The Items box lists the items that were added to the source control server. You can add these items to your local machine or delay the action.</p>
<p>
If you delay the addition, the development environment will remind you that there is a deferred addition to your local machine. You can also choose to do nothing, and keep the added item on the source control server only, with no effect to the local machine.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Items</h3>
<p>
Displays the new items from the source control server. Click the box next to the items you wish to add to your local machine, based on the button you choose (Add Now, Remind Later, or Do Nothing). A check mark will appear next to selected items.</p>
<h3>Add Now</h3>
<p>
Adds the items selected with a check mark in the Items box. This action pulls the server copy of the added item from source control server to the local machine so that the contents of the solution will match in both places.</p>
<p>
You will be reminded later about adding any items you did not select with a check mark in the Items box.</p>
<h3>Remind Later</h3>
<p>
Delays adding the items to the local machine until you are reminded. To select specific items to add to the local machine from the server, click the specific items to add, and then click Add Now.</p>
<p>
Pull reminders occur when a project is pulled. Pull actions include Get Latest, Check Out, and Undo Check Out. This is the default setting for reminder dialog boxes. You can change the timing of the dialog boxes by changing the options listed in the Source Control page (on the Tools menu, click Options, and then expand the Environment node and click the Source Control node).</p>
<h3>Do Nothing</h3>
<p>
Leaves all of the items as they are in both places. This means that the source control server's copy of the item is not added to the local machine. You will not be prompted with any more reminders for these items.</p>
<h3>Don't show pull reminder dialog boxes</h3>
<p>
Suppresses any more instances of the Pull Added Items from Server dialog box. You will not be able to add comments or use advanced options until you enable this dialog box again.</p>
<p>
You can enable this dialog box again by changing the options listed in the Source Control page (on the Tools menu, click Options, and then expand the Environment node and click the Source Control node).</p>
<h3>Advanced</h3>
<p>
Displays more options on adding items to source control. Your source control program supplies these options.</p>
