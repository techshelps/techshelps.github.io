<p>
Use this dialog box to customize your interface with source control. You can set source control dialog boxes to appear, appear only in specific cases, or disappear. You can set up default behaviors to fit your work style. For example, you can set the development environment to automatically update all of the items by getting the latest version of all of the items associated with a solution when you open that solution.</p>
<p>
You can change some options in the dialog boxes themselves. You can enable dialog boxes again by changing options here.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Get everything when opening a solution</h3>
<p>
Sets the development environment to Get all items associated with a solution every time you open that solution. You can disable the Get Latest Version dialog box by selecting the Don't show this dialog box again check box on the dialog box itself.</p>
<h3>Check in everything when closing the solution</h3>
<p>
Sets the development environment to check in all items associated with a solution every time you close that solution. You can disable the Check In Items dialog box by either selecting the Don't show this dialog box again check box on the dialog box. You can enable this dialog box again by selecting the Show detail dialog boxes (Check In) check box on this Options page.</p>
<h3>Perform background status updates</h3>
<p>
Sets the development environment to retrieve source control information from the master database when items are updated. This option is only available for other source control programs; it is not available in Visual SourceSafe.</p>
<h3>Add new projects to source control</h3>
<p>
Sets the development environment to automatically add new projects or items to source control. For items only, the Add to Source Control dialog box can be disabled by either selecting the Don't show this dialog box again button on the dialog box, or by selecting the After item add, remove or rename check box on this page.</p>
<h3>When checked in items are edited</h3>
<p>
Sets the preferred default behavior of the development environment when you are editing an item that is not checked out from source control (and is therefore read-only).
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Check Out — Checks out all items every time you start to edit an item. The development environment beeps as the item is checked out of source control. You may lose a keystroke while this action is performed. The editor may change to adapt to the new status of the item.<br><br></li>
<li>
Prompt — Causes the Check Out Items dialog box to appear every time you start to edit an item. With the dialog box enabled, you can set advanced options and add comments.<br><br></li>
<li>
Do Nothing — Disables all source control dialog boxes. The development environment does nothing when you edit an item that is not checked out. Your changes will only be on your local machine.</li>
</ul>
<h3>After item add, remove or rename</h3>
<p>
Sets the preferred default behavior of the development environment when you are adding an item, removing an item, or renaming an item locally. Typically, the development environment will prompt you to reflect these changes in the source control database. You can defer these changes with reminders, or do nothing.</p>
<p>
You can set the default to:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Prompt — Shows the appropriate dialog box for that action (Add to Source Control, Remove from Source Control, or Rename).<br><br></li>
<li>
Remind Later — Defers the action from the source control database, and triggers reminder dialog boxes about the deferred items. This keeps all of the added items, removed items, and renamed items local (changes are not reflected in the source control database).<br><br></li>
<li>
Do Nothing — Disables all dialog boxes and reminders. Sets the default behavior to no dialog boxes when these actions occur. These changes will remain local and are not reflected in the source control database.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Show pull reminders</h3>
<p>
Enables pull reminder dialog boxes according to the frequency setting you choose.</p>
<p>
Pull actions are changes retrieved from the source control server to the local machine. Pull actions include Get Latest, Check Out, and Undo Check Out. Pull reminder dialog boxes prompt you to synchronize the source control server and your local machine so that the same versions of the items exist in both places. Reminder dialog boxes can perform the action, delay the action until later, or skip the action entirely.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
On Every Pull — Shows the reminder dialog boxes every time you perform a pull action (Get Latest, Check Out, or Undo Check Out) on any item in the Project Explorer.<br><br></li>
<li>
On Project Pull — Shows the reminder dialog boxes when you perform a pull action (Get Latest, Check Out, or Undo Check Out) only on a project in the Project Explorer. This is the default setting.<br><br></li>
<li>
Never — Disables the pull reminder dialog boxes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Show push reminders</h3>
<p>
Enables push reminder dialog boxes according to the frequency setting you choose.</p>
<p>
Push actions are changes sent to the source control server from the local machine. Push actions include Check In and Add to Source Control. Push reminder dialog boxes prompt you to synchronize the source control server and the local machine so that the same versions of the items exist in both places. Reminder dialog boxes can perform the action, delay the action until later, or skip the action entirely.
<ul type=disc>
<li>
On Every Push — Shows the reminder dialog boxes every time you perform a push action (Check In or Add to Source Control) on any item in the Project Explorer.<br><br></li>
<li>
On Project Push — Shows the reminder dialog boxes when you perform a push action (Check In or Add to Source Control) only on a project in the Project Explorer. This is the default setting.<br><br></li>
<li>
Never — Disables the push reminder dialog boxes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Detail dialog boxes</h3>
<p>
Enables or disables the source control integration dialog boxes. Select the check box appropriate to show the detail dialog box during the source control action. There are dialog boxes for: Check Out, Check In, Get Latest Version, Undo Check Out, and Add to Source Control.</p>
<p>
For example, when you check an item into source control, you will see the Check In Items dialog box. On this dialog box you can select the Don't show this dialog box again check box to disable the Check In Items dialog box. When you next check in an item, you will not be prompted by the dialog box you disabled. While this technique is useful for repetitive actions, you cannot fill in comments or click any advanced source control options (where they are available) when the dialog boxes are not enabled. Select the check box for the dialog box here to enable it.</p>
<h3>Include only selected items</h3>
<p>
Controls the amount of information that appears in the Items list of the source control dialog boxes. The default is that only selected items (or all of the items in a selected solution) will appear in the Items box. You can expand that list by selecting the Recurse check box on the dialog box in question, or change this option.</p>
<h3>Login</h3>
<p>
Provides a place for you to enter your name here for logging into the source control database server. If supported by your source control provider, this name will be filled in automatically in the Login dialog box to reach your source control server.</p>
<h3>Advanced</h3>
<p>
Displays more options on adding items to source control. Your source control program supplies these options.</p>
