<p>
Use this dialog box to set the behavior of the development environment when you start editing an item that you did not check out first. When you click OK, items marked with a check mark in the Items box are checked out from the source control server in this instance.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Items</h3>
<p>
Displays a list of the items that are in conflict with your current action. Click the box next to the items you wish to check out from source control and a check mark will appear next to the item. You can click Check All to select all of the items at once.</p>
<h3>Don't show any more check out for edit dialogs</h3>
<p>
Suppresses any more instances of the Check Out For Editing dialog box. If you suppress the dialog box, when you are editing an item that is not checked out, the development environment beeps and checks the item out for you (without prompting).</p>
<p>
You can enable this dialog box again by changing the options listed in the Source Control page (on the Tools menu, click Options, and then expand the Environment node and click the Source Control node).
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Always Check Out — Choose this if you would like the development environment to always check out the item from source control. This means that if you edit items in the development environment, you will not be prompted, and the environment will beep and check out the item. You may also lose a keystroke while this action is performed. The editor or window you are in may change to accommodate the change in item status.<br><br></li>
<li>
Always Do Nothing — Choose this if you would like the default behavior of the development environment to leave the item local and not check it out from source control. This means that as you edit items in the development environment, you will not be prompted to check out an item. If the editor allows you to edit the local item, it will contain different information than the copy in the source control database (which you may have to manually merge together later).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Comment</h3>
<p>
Provides a place to enter comments. If your source control program is Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Visual SourceSafe™, you can type up to 4,095 characters.</p>
<h3>Check All</h3>
<p>
Selects with a check mark all of the items visible in the Items box. To see additional subfolders and levels of items, click Recurse. Only items that are visible in the Items box and are shown with a check mark are checked out from source control.</p>
<h3>Advanced</h3>
<p>
Displays more options on adding items to source control. Your source control program supplies these options.</p>
