<p>
In the course of working with source control, you might at some time lose your connection to your source control server, or lose a connection to your source control project on the server due to a branching source control action.</p>
<p>
When you are working offline, you are not connected to the source control database/server. This can be intentional (as when you are working remotely on a laptop) or accidental (as when a network connection breaks).</p>
<p>
You may need to reestablish a connection with your source control project if a project is moved in the source control database. In this case, you must redirect the development environment to the new location, so that the development environment can update the status of files in those projects or the solution.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>To reconnect to the source control server through the development environment</b>
<ol>
<li>
On the <b>Project</b> menu, point to <b>Source Control</b>, and then click <b>Change/Set Connection</b>.<br><br></li>
<li>
In the <b>Change/Set Connection</b> dialog box, click <b>Work Online</b>, and then click <b>Connection</b>.<p class=tl>
The source control program displays a dialog box that connects you to a source control server or project. Find your project and click <b>OK</b>.</P></li>
</ol>
<p>
When you branch a project in Visual SourceSafe, you need to redirect the development environment to point to the new location of the project in the source control database.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Warning</b></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can usually safely use the Share command in Visual SourceSafe to share files. However, solution and project files (.sln, .vjp, etc.) should never be shared, but always branched.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>To reconnect to a source control project through the development environment after a branching operation</b>
<ol>
<li>
In the <b>Project Explorer</b>, select the project.<br><br></li>
<li>
If you wish to reconnect the whole of the solution to a single place where it was previously connected, select any item, and then select the <b>Apply changes to other projects with similar connections</b> check box.<br><br></li>
<li>
On the <b>Project</b> menu, point to <b>Source Control</b>, and then click <b>Set Connection</b>.<br><br></li>
<li>
In the <b>Set Connection</b> dialog box, click <b>Work Online</b>, and then click <b>Connection</b>.<p class=tl>
The source control program displays a dialog box that connects you to a source control server or, if you are still connected with your source control server, the projects in source control.</P></li>
<li>
In the dialog box provided by your source control program, choose the source control project. If you have branched all projects at once, you may wish to select the <b>Apply changes to other projects with similar connections</b> check box.<br><br></li>
<li>
Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
