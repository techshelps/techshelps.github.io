<h3> Coordination of Automation and the Imaging Application</H3><p>  </P>
<p>Automation is not aware of changes made interactively by an end-user in the Imaging application.  The objects known to automation stay in the same state in which they were left programmatically.  If an end-user changes a displayed object, automation does not update this object in its Application object.  For example, if the end-user changes the active page, automation does not update the ActivePage property.  However, properties and methods are available so that you can determine if a change has occurred, and you can update the objects known to automation, if desired.</P>
