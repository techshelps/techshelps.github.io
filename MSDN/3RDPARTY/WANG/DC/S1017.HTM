<h3> Resolution</H3><p>  </P>
<p>Resolution is the overall measurement of image quality.  It is expressed as the number of dots- or pixels-per-inch.  It is possible for an image to have different horizontal and vertical resolutions.  For example, images received from fax transmissions typically have resolutions of 200 by 100 pixels-per-inch.  The more pixels-per-inch, the higher the resolution.  Image quality increases in proportion with the resolution value.  Therefore, the higher the resolution, the greater the image quality.</P>
