<h3> What Is Scanning?</H3><p>  </P>
<p>Scanning is the procedure for capturing data as images in electronic form.</P>
<p>An image acquisition device (typically a scanner) is connected to the PC and controlled by an application program.  The application program communicates with the scanner through an interface called the scanner data source (driver), which is usually supplied by the manufacturer of the scanner.  Imaging OLE controls support TWAIN, the industry-standard specification for image capture.</P>
