<h3> Common Palette</H3><p>  </P>
<p>A common palette is shared by all images being displayed.  It is a special, 8-bit palette that has a variety of colors, chosen because they give generally good results for both color and gray-scale images.  While the resulting image display is not as good as a custom palette rendition of the image, the common palette has the advantage of permitting any number of images to be displayed simultaneously with good overall quality.</P>
