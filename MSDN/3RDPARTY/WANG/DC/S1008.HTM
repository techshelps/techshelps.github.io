<h3> Compression Types</H3><p>  </P>
<p>Imaging OLE controls support the following compression types:</P>
<p><B>RBA</B> -- The RBA compression type is used to compress black-and-white AWD (At Work Document) images.  RBA is a Microsoft-proprietary compression type.</P>
<p><B>Group3(1D)</B> -- A compression type based on the CCITT Group3 fax standard, Group3(1D) is used to compress black-and-white TIFF image files.  Group3(1D) encodings are designed to provide reliable delivery of image data over inherently unreliable data links.  It is commonly used to compress images for fax transmission.</P>
<p><B>Group3(2D)</B> – Similar to the Group3(1D) compression type, Group3(2D) is used to compress black-and-white TIFF image files for fax transmission exclusively.  Group 3(2D) encodings provide a high degree of error recovery during fax transmission.  Read-only.</P>
<p><B>Group3(Modified Huffman [MH])</B> – Also similar to the Group3(1D) compression type, except Group3(MH) provides no end-of-line characters.  It is used to compress black-and-white TIFF image files.</P>
<p><B>Group4(2D)</B> -- Based on the CCITT Group4 fax standard, Group4(2D) is used to compress black-and-white TIFF image files. Group 4(2D) encodings are designed to provide delivery of image data over reliable data links, such as ISDN or X.25.  It provides superior compression for non-dithered images when compared to the Group3(1D) compression type.</P>
<p><B>JPEG</B> -- The Joint Photographics Experts Group compression type is used to compress 24-bit color (RGB24) and 8-bit gray-scale (Gray8) image files.  JPEG produces a high compression ratio, but some image data is actually lost during compression.</P>
<p><B>LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch)</B> -- A lossless compression type (that is, no data is lost during compression).  It is used with black-and-white; BGR24, RGB24, Palettized4, and Palettized8 color images; as well as Gray4 and Gray8 gray-scale images.  Read-only.</P>
<p><B>PackBits</B> -- A simple, byte-oriented, run-length compression type, PackBits is used to compress black-and-white TIFF image files.</P>
<p><B>PCX</B> -- A ZSoft-proprietary compression type, PCX is used to compress multipage DCX and single-page PCX black-and-while and color images.</P>
<p><B>Xerox-proprietary</B> -- The Xerox-proprietary compression type is used to compress XIF images.</P>
