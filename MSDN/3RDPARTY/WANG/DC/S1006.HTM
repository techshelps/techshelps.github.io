<h3> Compression Options</H3><p>  </P>
<p>Compression options are bitwise values that dictate how image data is compressed.  A relationship exists between compression options and compression types, where certain compression options apply only to specific compression types.</P>
<p>Whenever a compression option and a compression type are specified as arguments to an Imaging OLE method, the software checks the relationship for validity.</P>
<p>Imaging OLE controls support the following compression options:</P>
<p><B>Compressed LTR</B> -- Compressed bit order, Left-To-Right.  The compressed data codes begin at the most significant bit of each byte and are ordered from the most significant bit to the least significant bit.  The Compressed LTR compression option applies to all compression types that support black-and-white images, except the PackBits compression type.</P>
<p><B>EOL</B> -- End Of Line.  Each line of data is terminated with a standard end-of-line bit.  The EOL compression option applies to the Group3(1D) and Group3(2D) compression types.</P>
<p><B>Expand LTR</B> -- Expanded bit order, Left-To-Right.  The expanded data codes begin at the most significant bit of each byte and are ordered from the most significant bit to the least significant bit.  The Expand LTR compression option applies only to image data that is being read; it is therefore meaningless when writing or converting images.  The Expand LTR compression option applies to all compression types except JPEG.</P>
<p><B>Negate</B> -- A high-level request to invert black-and-white data.  The Negate compression option applies to all compression types that support black-and-white images.</P>
<p><B>Packed Lines</B> -- The compressed data is packed into bytes with no padding at the end of each line (the data is not byte-aligned).  The Packed Lines compression option applies to the Group3(1D), Group3(2D), and Group4(2D) compression types.</P>
<p><B>Prefixed EOL</B> -- Each strip of data is prefixed by a standard end-of-line bit sequence.  The Prefixed EOL compression option requires that the EOL compression option be set as well.  It applies to the Group3(1D) and Group3(2D) compression types. </P>
<p><B>JPEG Options</B> -- Joint Photographics Experts Group compression options.  JPEG compression options comprise all combinations of high, medium, or low compression and high, medium, or low quality (resolution).</P>
<p>The higher the compression, the lower the disk space requirement; the higher the resolution, the greater the image quality.  An image compressed with the Low Compression/High Quality option has the highest disk space requirement and the highest image quality.  Conversely, an image compressed with the High Compression/Low Quality option has the lowest disk space requirement and the lowest image quality.</P>
<p>The JPEG compression options apply to the JPEG compression type, which can be used with JPG and TIFF file types.</P>
