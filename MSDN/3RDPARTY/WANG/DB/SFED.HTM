<h1>Alternative Implementation</h1>
<BR></P><p>This document describes the proposed annotation extension developed for TIFF 6.0 by Wang Laboratories, Inc. to provide information for creating and reading annotation data. This document:</P>
<ul><li><p>Defines annotation data and lists available annotation marks.</P>
<p><li>Describes the format of annotation data that is stored in TIFF 6.0 files.</P>
<p><li>Explains the annotation mark attribute structure.</P>
<p><li>Discusses named blocks and defines the annotation named block structures.</P>
<p><li>Defines each type of annotation mark and summarizes the associated attributes and named blocks.</P></ul>

<p>An alternative way to create annotation data is available in the Wang Imaging for Windows&reg; 95 product. This product includes OCXs that provide a higher-level interface to the creation of annotation data. In particular, the Image Edit OCX and the Image Annotation Tool Button OCX include properties, methods, and events that enable application engineers to implement programmatic generation of annotations. OCX methods are callable from many programming environments, including Visual Basic and Visual C++.</P>
<p>Imaging for Windows&reg; 95 is available on the Wang or Microsoft home page at the following locations:</P>
<p>http://www.wang.com</P>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/windows</P>
<p>You can download and install Imaging for Windows&reg; 95, and then display the OCX help text, called wangocxd.hlp, which is located in the Windows help directory. Alternatively, you can read about the OCXs on the Wang home page in the topic, <I>Review of the OLE Custom Controls</I>.</P></BODY></HTML>
