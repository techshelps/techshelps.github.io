<h2>Named Block Conventions</H2><p>  </P>
<p>The name of a named block is case sensitive; for example, ABC is not the same as aBc.</P>
<p>The named block name is left-justified and padded with nulls to eight bytes. All eight bytes are used and compared regardless of content.</P>
<p>All annotation marks allow any number of named blocks to be associated with them. Each named block is associated with one and only one structure. A mark cannot have multiple blocks with the same name.</P>
<p>All names beginning with Oi (Oixxxxxx) are reserved. Oi indicates OPEN/image.</P></BODY></HTML>
