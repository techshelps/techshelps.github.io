<P>The first time the development environment reads a resource file created by another application, it marks all included header files as read-only. Subsequently, you can use the <B>Resource Includes</B> command on the <B>View</B> menu to add additional read-only symbol header files.</P>

<P>One reason you may want to use read-only symbol definitions is for symbol files that you plan to share among several projects.</P>

<P>You would also use included symbol files when you have existing resources with symbol definitions that use expressions rather than simple integers to define the symbol value. For example,</P>

<PRE><CODE>#define   IDC_CONTROL1 2100
#define   IDC_CONTROL2 (IDC_CONTROL1+1)
</CODE></PRE>

<P>The environment will correctly interpret these calculated symbols as long as:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>The calculated symbols are placed in a read-only symbols file.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Your resource file contains resources to which these calculated symbols are already assigned.</LI>
</UL>

<P class=label><B>To include shared (read-only) symbols in your resource file</B>

<OL>
	<LI>From the <B>View</B> menu, choose <B>Resource Includes</B>.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>In the <B>Read-only symbol directives</B> box, use the <B>#include</B> compiler directive to specify the file where you want the read-only symbols to be kept. (You should not call the file Resource.h, since that is the filename normally used by the main symbol header file.)
<P class=atl><B><B>Important</B></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you type in the <B>Read-Only Symbol Directives</B> box is included in the resource file exactly as you type it. Make sure what you type does not contain any spelling or syntax errors.</p>
<P class=tl>You should use the <B>Read-only symbol directives</B> box to include files with symbol definitions only. Do not include resource definitions; otherwise, duplicate resource definitions will be created when the file is saved.</P></LI>

	<LI>Place the symbols in the file you specified. 
<P class=tl>The symbols in files included in this way are evaluated each time you open your resource file, but they are not replaced on the disk when you save your file.</P></LI>

	<LI>Click <B>OK</B>.</LI>
