<P class=dt><B>cannot open include file 'filename'</B></P>

<P>The file specified in an <B>#include</B> preprocessor directive could not be found or could not be opened for other reasons. For instance, a network drive may be unavailable because of a network error that is not immediately apparent.</P>

<P class=label><B>Tips</B>

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Make sure the filename is spelled correctly in the <B>#include </B>directive. Also, make sure the file extension (usually .H) is correct.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>When compiling from the command prompt, make sure that the <B>INCLUDE</B> environment variable is valid and that the correct path for the file is specified. See <A HREF="_predir_the_.23.include_directive.htm">The #include Directive</A> in the <I>Preprocessor Reference</I> for more information.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>When compiling in the Visual C++ environment, make sure the Include Files directories are set correctly by using the <B>Directories</B> tab on the <B>Options</B> dialog box (<B>Tools</B> menu). <BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>If any include files are being accessed over a network, make sure that the networked machine is still available and that you have read permission for that machine. Often, rebooting a machine will reset the network interface card and the network will become available again.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The compiler may have run out of file handles. This is especially common when include files are deeply nested. To increase the number of file handles available to the compiler:
<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Close other files and applications. <BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Increase the number of file handles the operating system makes available to applications. <BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Reduce the level of nesting of include files.</LI>
