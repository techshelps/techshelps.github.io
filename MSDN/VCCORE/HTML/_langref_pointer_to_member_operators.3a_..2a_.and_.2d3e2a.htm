<P>The binary operator <CODE>-&gt;</CODE><B>*</B> combines its first operand, which must be a pointer to an object of class type, with its second operand, which must be a pointer-to-member type.</P>

<P>In an expression containing the <B>.*</B> operator, the first operand must be of the class type of the pointer to member specified in the second operand or of a type unambiguously derived from that class.</P>

<P>In an expression containing the <CODE>-&gt;</CODE><B>*</B> operator, the first operand must be of the type "pointer to the class type" of the type specified in the second operand, or it must be of a type unambiguously derived from that class.</P>
