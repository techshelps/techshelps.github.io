<P>Before you can sign files, you need to obtain a Software Publisher Certificate (SPC). To do this, you must make a request to a Certification Authority. During the application process, you must generate a key pair and provide the Certification Authority with identification information, such as your name, address, and public key. You must also make a legally binding pledge that you cannot and will not distribute software you know or should have known contains viruses or will otherwise maliciously harm the user's machine or code. </P>

<P>For more information about obtaining a Software Publisher Certificate (SPC), see http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/security/authcode/codesign.htm. To apply for a certificate, see http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/security/authcode/certs.htm. To create a test certificate to test signing your files, see <A HREF="_vccore_making_a_test_software_publisher_certificate.htm">Making a Test Software Publisher Certificate</A>.</P>

<P>The Certification Authority generates a Software Publisher Certificate that conforms to the industry standard X.509 certificate format with Version 3 extensions. The certificate identifies you and contains your public key. It is stored by the Certification Authority for reference and a copy is returned to you via electronic mail. After accepting the certificate, you should include a copy in all published software signed with the private key. </P>
