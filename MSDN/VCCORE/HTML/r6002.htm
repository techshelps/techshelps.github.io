<P class=dt><B>floating-point support not loaded</B></P>

<P>The program needs the floating-point library, but the library was not linked to the program.</P>

<P>One of the following may have occurred:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>The program was compiled or linked with an option (such as /FPi87) that required a coprocessor, but the program was run on a machine that did not have a coprocessor installed.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>A format string for a <B>printf</B> or <B>scanf</B> function contained a floating-point format specification, and the program did not contain any floating-point values or variables.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The compiler minimizes a program's size by loading floating-point support only when necessary. The compiler cannot detect floating-point format specifications in format strings, so it does not load the necessary floating-point routines.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Use a floating-point argument to correspond to the floating-point format specification, or perform a floating-point assignment elsewhere in the program. This causes floating-point support to be loaded.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>In a mixed-language program, a C library was specified before a FORTRAN library when the program was linked. Relink and specify the C library last.</LI>
