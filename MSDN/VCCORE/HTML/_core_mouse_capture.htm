<P>Mouse capture is also affected by the Windows 95 and Windows NT localized input queues. If the mouse is captured on mouse down, the window capturing the mouse receives mouse input until the mouse button is released, as in Windows 3.<I>x</I>. But if the mouse is captured while the mouse button is up, the window receives mouse input only as long as the mouse is over that window or another window created by the same thread.</P>
