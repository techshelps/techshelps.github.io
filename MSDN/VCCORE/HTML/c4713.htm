<H1><A NAME="c4713"></A><SUP></SUP>Compiler Warning (level 1) C4713</H1>

<P class=dt><B>internal compiler error: restartable</B></P>

<P class=indent><B><B>Note</B></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This message is only a warning. The resulting code should be perfectly correct and safe, but is not optimized.</P>

<P>This error is only emitted by the optimizing compiler when it detects a problem while generating code in Pass 2. In these cases the problem has been detected at a point which allows the compiler to restart the code-generation process for the function where the error was detected. The compiler turns off optimizations for this function and regenerates the code. Note that optimizations are turned off only for the particular function, not for the entire module.</P>

<P class=label><B>Tips</B>

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>If you wish to maximize the optimization used in the function that is causing the warning, you can determine which option is at fault by removing options one at a time and recompiling until the message goes away. Generally the last one removed is causing the problem and all other optimizations can be used safely. The options that most commonly cause this warning are /Oe, /Oi, /Ol, and /Oa.
<P class=tl>Once the offending optimization is discovered, it need not be turned off for the entire compilation. The offending optimization can be disabled with the <B>optimize</B> pragma while compiling the function where the error occurred, but enabled for the rest of the module. </P></LI>

	<LI>It is rare, but such errors can occur at very low optimization levels or even when optimization is disabled. In such cases rewriting the line where the error is reported (or possibly several lines, including the one causing the error) may be a solution.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>If none of these options works, contact Microsoft Product Support Services for help.</LI>
</UL>

<P>In all cases of internal compiler errors, restartable or not, report the problem to Product Support Services, providing a test case and the options used. Include the full text of the error message, including the module and line number of the compiler file which is given in the second line of the error message. This will allow Microsoft to find and fix the underlying problem for future versions of the compiler.</P>
