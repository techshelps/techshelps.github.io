<P class=dt><B>nonincremental update requires all .SBR files</B></P>

<P>An attempt was made to build a new browse information (.BSC) file, but one or more of the specified .SBR files was truncated. This message is always preceded by warning <A HREF="bk4502.htm">BK4502</A>, which gives the name of the .SBR file that caused the error.</P>

<P>BSCMAKE can process a truncated, or zero-length, .SBR file only when a .BSC file already exists and is being incrementally updated.</P>

<P>One of the following may be a cause:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>The .BSC file was missing.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The wrong filename was specified.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The file was corrupted, and a full build was required.</LI>
