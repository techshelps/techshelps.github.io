<P>If you plan to distribute MFC and ATL controls via the Internet, you should package them as signed Cabinet (CAB) files. Signed files assure a user downloading your control that the code is safe. A CAB file contains a compressed version of your control plus information about how your control is to be installed, for example, what DLLs need to be installed along with the OCX. </P>

<P>The tools you need to create and sign CAB files are provided on the Visual C++ CD in the CAB&amp;SIGN directory. The utilities in the CAB&amp;SIGN directory are not installed automatically when you install Visual C++, so you must copy the contents of the CAB&amp;SIGN directory to your hard drive.</P>

<P>Before you can sign files, you need to get a Software Publisher Certificate. You must apply for your own certificate to a Certification Authority. With the tools in the CAB&amp;SIGN directory you can create a test certificate for testing purposes, but this certificate cannot be used to sign code for distribution. See step 1 for information about applying for a Software Publisher Certificate.</P>

<P>These are the steps to create a signed CAB file:
