<P>You can build a project without default libraries by selecting the <B>Ignore all default libraries</B> option in the <B>General</B> category of the <B>Link</B> tab in the <B>Project Settings</B> dialog box (or with /NOD or /NODEFAULTLIB command-line switches). If your previous project was built with no default libraries and you want to make iostream calls, you must name one of the new Standard C++ run-time libraries (LIBCP.LIB, LIBCPMT.LIB, MSVCPRT.LIB, and so on) or one of the old iostream run-time libraries (LIBCI.LIB, LIBCIMT.LIB, MSVCIRT.LIB, and so on) in order to link with the proper library. Use the command line or the <B>Object/library modules</B> text box in the <B>General</B> category of the <B>Link</B> tab in <B>Project Settings</B>.</P>

<P>In previous Visual C++ versions (4.1 and earlier), the run-time library names were LIBC.LIB, LIBCMT.LIB, and MSVCRT.LIB. These libraries included the old iostream library. The old iostream library has now been removed from these libraries. If you do not choose to ignore default libraries and you include old iostream header files in your code, the old iostream run-time libraries (LIBCI.LIB, LIBCIMT.LIB, MSVCIRT.LIB, and so on) are linked by default. However, if you have chosen to ignore default libraries and have added one of the early run-time libraries by hand (on the command line or in the <B>Object/library modules</B> text box in the <B>General</B> category of the <B>Link</B> tab in <B>Project Settings</B>), your iostream calls will now break.</P>
