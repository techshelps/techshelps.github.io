<P>If your C/C++ program is Visual C++ or ANSI standard C/C++, there is no problem porting it to the development environment. If you have a makefile created outside the development environment, your makefile will be wrapped and a project will be created with one file in it, your makefile. The project should still build and run from within the development environment. </P>

<P>If you do not have a makefile, open a new project workspace, select the compile and link settings you need, add your source C/C++ files to the project, and build the project. </P>

<P>You can also create a .MAK file from within the development environment that can be used to build the project from the command line. Note that in previous versions of Visual C++, a .MAK file that contained project settings and could also be used from the command-line was created automatically. Starting with Visual C++ 5.0, a .DSP file is created to hold the project settings. You can easily create a .MAK file to use from the command-line, but this file cannot be used later to open the project as a native project in the development environment. The .MAK file will be opened as a project that was not created in the development environment.
