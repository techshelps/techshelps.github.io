<P>If a precompiled header file exists (either MSVC.PCH or one specified by /Fp<I>filename</I>), it is compared to the current compilation for consistency. Unless the following requirements are met, a new precompiled header file is created and the new file overwrites the old:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>The current compiler options must match those specified when the precompiled header was created.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The current working directory must match that specified when the precompiled header was created.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The order and values of all <B>#include</B> and <B>#pragma</B> directives must match those specified when the precompiled header was created. These, along with <B>#define</B> directives, are checked one by one as they appear during subsequent compilations that use the precompiled header. The values of <B>#define</B> directives must match. However, a sequence of <B>#define</B> directives need not occur in exactly the same order because there are no semantic order dependencies for <B>#define</B> directives. The <B>#pragma</B> directives must be nearly identical, with a few exceptions; for example, multiple spaces outside of strings are treated as a single space to allow for different programming styles.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The value and order of include paths specified on the command line with /I options must match those specified when the precompiled header was created. <BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The time stamps of all the header files (all files specified with <B>#include</B> directives) used to build the precompiled header must match those that existed when the precompiled header was created. </LI>
