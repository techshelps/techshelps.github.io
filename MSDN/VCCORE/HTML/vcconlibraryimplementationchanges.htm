<H1><A NAME="vcconlibraryimplementationchanges"></A>Library Implementation Changes</H1>

<H3>CAsyncSocket</H3>

<P>The <B>SendTo</B> member function correctly returns errors. In previous versions of MFC, <B>SendTo</B> returned <B>FALSE</B> for some errors. The function now returns a proper WinSock error code in all circumstances.</P>

<H3>Collection Classes</H3>

<P><B>FindIndex</B> returns <B>NULL</B> for negative indexes.</P>

<P>List-based collections with a <B>FindIndex</B> member will return <B>NULL</B> if the index passed to the function is negative. In previous releases, a negative index caused the program to stop responding or an access violation.</P>

<H3>CControlBar</H3>

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>New <B>SetBorders</B> member function
<P class=tl>The <B>SetBorders</B> member is a public accessor that allows other classes to set the bar’s borders.</P></LI>

	<LI>New <B>DrawGripper</B> member function
<P class=tl>The <B>DrawGripper</B> member function draws a "gripper," that is a user-interface clue on command bars that are movable or resizable. <B>CalcInsideRect</B> adjusts for the correct sizing of a bar that has a gripper.</P></LI>

	<LI>New assertion behavior for <B>m_dwStyle</B>
<P class=tl>The <B>CControlBar</B> class will assert that the <B>m_dwStyle</B> member only contains MFC-specific bits—masked by <B>CBRS_ALL</B>. This assertion will fire if user code incorrectly sets window-style bits.</P></LI>
</UL>

<H3>CDaoDatabase</H3>

<P>Some recent releases of MFC had problems running correctly on machines that weren’t updated to DAO 3.5. Those problems have been resolved, but it is still advisable to upgrade to DAO 3.5, due to performance and stability improvements.</P>

<H3>CDaoRecordset</H3>

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Newly <B>const</B> members
<P class=tl>The <B>IsBOF</B> and <B>IsEOF</B> member functions are now <B>const</B>.</P></LI>

	<LI>Unicode version of <B>DFX_Text</B> fixed
<P class=tl>The <B>DFX_Text</B> function would not allocate enough space when binding Unicode strings, and this problem has been fixed.</P></LI>
</UL>

<H3>CDC</H3>

<P>In previous versions of MFC, <B>CDC</B> member functions would sometimes return unpredictable values for extreme failure conditions. These functions have been cleaned up and now return the correct error code.</P>

<H3>CInternetFile</H3>

<P><B>ReadString</B> doesn’t truncate</P>

<P>In some circumstances, the <B>ReadString</B> member function would truncate data read from the connection. This bug has been fixed.</P>

<H3>CInternetSession</H3>

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Aggressive buffer validation
<P class=tl>All Internet-related functions in MFC more aggressively assert on the validity of memory buffer pointer parameters.</P></LI>

	<LI>No async support
<P class=tl><B>INTERNET_FLAG_ASYNC</B> was never supported by MFC. The presence of this flag now causes debug builds of MFC to assert.</P></LI>
</UL>

<H3>COleControl</H3>

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Ignores <B>fastBeginPaint</B>
<P class=tl>The style bit <B>fastBeginPaint</B> is now ignored. ActiveX controls are always expected to erase their background in <B>OnDraw</B>, as they won’t receive <B>WM_ERASEBKGND</B> when rendering to a metafile DC.</P></LI>

	<LI>Reflector window handles <B>WM_SIZE</B>
<P class=tl>The reflector window now handles <B>WM_SIZE</B> appropriately. Previously, the message was ignored.</P></LI>
</UL>

<H3>COleDateTime</H3>

<P>Member function rounding errors</P>

<P>Several rounding errors that existed in previous versions of the following member functions have been remedied: <B>GetDays</B>, <B>GetHours</B>, <B>GetMinutes</B>, <B>GetSeconds, GetTotalDays</B>, <B>GetTotalHours</B>, <B>GetTotalMinutes</B>, <B>GetTotalSeconds</B>.</P>

<H3>COleDocument</H3>

<P>Previous versions of MFC opened a storage with <B>STGM_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE</B>. MFC now uses the more appropriate <B>STGM_SHARE_DENY_WRITE</B> flag, which allows other applications to read the storage while it is opened by the document object.</P>

<H3>CPropertyPage</H3>

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Bogus assert fixed
<P class=tl>The creation of a property sheet with pages from a <B>DIALOGEX</B> resource would sometimes needlessly assert. The assertion has been corrected.</P></LI>

	<LI><B>MapWizardResult</B> return code
<P class=tl>The <B>MapWizardResult</B> member function would sometimes return an incorrect value. This problem has been corrected.</P></LI>

	<LI>Property page activation could fail
<P class=tl>Some property page creations would result in a blank dialog box. This problem was fixed.</P></LI>

	<LI>Incorrect return code from property page procedure
<P class=tl>MFC’s handler for <B>EndDialog</B> incorrectly returned <B>IDCANCEL</B> instead of <B>PSBTN_CANCEL</B>.</P></LI>

	<LI><B>m_nModalResult</B> incorrectly set
<P class=tl>A property page closed with the system menu or by the user pressing the close button might not correctly set the <B>m_nModalResult</B> member to <B>IDCANCEL</B>. This has been fixed.</P></LI>
</UL>

<H3>CRecordset</H3>

<P>The <B>RFX_Int</B> function incorrectly handled <B>NULL</B> values in previous versions of the library. This problem has been corrected.</P>

<H3>CTabCtrl</H3>

<P><B>SetItemState</B> and <B>GetItemState</B> member functions have been added to support new functionality exposed by the revised COMCTL32.DLL.</P>

<H3>CToolBar</H3>

<P>The <B>SetSizes</B> function previously caused an assert when it wasn’t attached to a window, but now reacts by setting the member data of the object to reflect the size instead of moving the window’s position.</P>

<H3>CScrollView</H3>

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Mouse wheel asserts fixed
<P class=tl>A bug that caused a bogus assert when the mouse wheel was used to scroll a <B>CScrollView</B> has been fixed.</P></LI>

	<LI>Mouse wheel page-mode scrolling fixed
<P class=tl>A bug that made page-by-page views scroll in the wrong direction has been fixed.</P></LI>
</UL>

<H3>CView</H3>

<P>The print preview bar has been restored to its rightful position—within the parent frame.</P>

<H3>CWinThread</H3>

<P>The MFC-supplied <B>PreTranslateMessage</B> member function is no longer responsible for canceling active tooltips. This code has been moved to <B>CWnd::FilterToolTipMessage</B>. This change was necessary to support the new tracking tooltip styles.</P>

<H3>CWnd</H3>

<P>The <B>CenterWindow</B> function has been fixed to work properly on multiple-monitor machines.</P>
