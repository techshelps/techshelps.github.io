<H1><A NAME="c2772"></A>Compiler Error C2772</H1>

<P class=dt><B>#import referenced a type from a missing type library; '__missing_type__' used as a place holder</B></P>

<P>While the compiler was processing the type library named by the <B>#import</B> directive, it encountered a referenced type defined in a secondary type library. In addition, this secondary type library could not be found, and the compiler could not send this typename to the type library headers. A dummy typename, "<CODE>__missing_type__</CODE>", was sent to the output instead. This will trigger additional errors as the type library headers are compiled.</P>

<P>This error occurs when the secondary type library is not properly registered or missing. When the compiler detects this error, it cannot determine the name of the missing secondary type library. Search for the string "<CODE>__missing_type__</CODE>" in the type library headers. This may help determine the name of the secondary type library.</P>
