<P class=dt><B>cannot find precompiled types file; relink with filename</B></P>

<P>The program used a precompiled header, but the program was linked without <I>filename</I>. This file is the object file that was created when the header was precompiled. If the program uses a library that was created using precompiled headers, then <I>filename</I> was not linked from the library.</P>

<P>One of the following may be a solution:

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>Extract the object from the library and link it to the program explicitly.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Force LINK to include the object in the program by specifying the /INCLUDE option with a symbol from the object.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Change the source code so that code or data in <I>filename</I> is referenced either from an object file that uses the library or from another module that is being linked from the library.</LI>
