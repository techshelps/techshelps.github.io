<H1><A NAME="_core_project_settings_dialog_box"></A>Project Settings Dialog Box</H1>

<P>Set compiler and linker options in the Project Settings dialog box, which you can open by clicking Settings on the Project menu. </P>

<P>The Reset button resets the project settings of a project or a file to the settings that existed when the project or file was created. This button is available if both of the following conditions are met: 

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>A single project or a single file is selected in the Settings For pane of the Project Settings dialog box.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The settings of the selection have changed.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The Reset button is not available when multiple projects or files are selected. </P>

<P>For information on the build options available in the Project Settings dialog box, either type an option name in the Search dialog box (Help menu) or see <A HREF="_core_set_compiler_options.htm">Set Compiler Options</A> and <A HREF="_core_set_linker_options.htm">Set Linker Options</A> for overview lists. </P>

<H2>Applying settings to particular entities</H2>

<P>In the Project Settings dialog box you can specify all the settings for your build. You can specify settings for particular source files, for a version (release or debug), or for the project as a whole. The mechanism for determining this distinction is the left half of the dialog box, which is labeled Settings For. </P>

<H2>Determining which settings are in effect</H2>

<P>The Common | Project | Source File Options text box, at the bottom right of the Project Settings dialog box, displays the compiler options that are currently selected. The options are displayed using their command-line-equivalent names, such as /G5.</P>

<P>The name of this text box changes depending on what is selected in the Settings For pane in the left half of the dialog box. When a project is selected in Settings For, the text box is named <B>Project Options</B>. When a source file is selected, the text box is named <B>Source File Options</B>. When multiple projects or files are selected, the text box is named <B>Common Options</B>, and it displays the options that are common to the selections.</P>

<P>You cannot type in the text box when it is named Common Options. However, when it is named Project Options or Source File Options, the text box accepts any option that is available from the C/C++ tab. It also accepts those compiler options that are otherwise available only from the command line.</P>

<P>You are responsible for the accuracy of any option you type in the text box. If an option is recognized as one that can be set using a dialog box control, the dialog box control is changed to reflect the option. However, if the option is not recognized, it is left in the options string and passed to the compiler as is.</P>
