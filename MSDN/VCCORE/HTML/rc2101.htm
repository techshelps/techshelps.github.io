<H1><A NAME="rc2101"></A><SUP></SUP>Resource Compiler Error RC2101</H1>

<P class=dt><B>Invalid directive in preprocessed RC file</B></P>

<P>The RC file contains a <B>#pragma</B> directive.</P>

<P>Use the <B>#ifndef</B> preprocessor directive with the RC_INVOKED constant that the Resource Compiler defines when it processes an include file. Place the <B>#pragma</B> directive inside a block of code that is not processed when the RC_INVOKED constant is defined. Code in the block is processed only by the C/C++ compiler and not by the Resource Compiler. The following sample code demonstrates this technique: </P>

<PRE><CODE>#ifndef RC_INVOKED
#pragma pack(2)  // C/C++ only, ignored by Resource Compiler
#endif
</CODE></PRE>

<P>The <B>#pragma</B> preprocessor directive has no meaning in an .RC file. The<B> #include</B> preprocessor directive is used frequently in an .RC file to include a header file (either a project-based custom header file or a standard header file provided by Microsoft with one of its products). Some of these include files contain the <B>#pragma</B> directive. Because a header file can include one or more other header files, the file that contains the offending <B>#pragma</B> directive may not be immediately obvious. </P>

<P>The <B>#ifndef</B> RC_INVOKED technique can control including header files in project-based header files.</P>
