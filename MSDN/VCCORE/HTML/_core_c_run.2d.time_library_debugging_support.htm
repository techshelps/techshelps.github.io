<H1><A NAME="_core_c_run.2d.time_library_debugging_support"></A>C Run-Time Library Debugging Support</H1>

<P>Visual C++&nbsp; adds extensive debugging support to the C run-time library, letting you step directly into run-time functions when debugging an application. The library also provides a variety of tools to keep track of heap allocations, locate memory leaks, and track down other memory-related problems.</P>

<P>Much of the heap-checking technology included in the debug version of the C run-time library has been moved from the Microsoft Foundation Class library. To use the heap-checking technology, debug builds of MFC applications must now be linked with a debug version of the run-time library.</P>

<P>The library contains <A HREF="_core_debug_reporting_functions_of_the_c_run.2d.time_library.htm">debug reporting functions</A>, such as <B>_CrtDbgReport</B> and <B>_CrtIsValidPointer</B>; <A HREF="_core_using_macros_for_verification_and_reporting.htm">macros for verification and reporting</A>, such as <B>_ASSERT</B> and <B>_RPTn</B>; functions that <A HREF="_core_memory_management_and_the_debug_heap.htm">use a debug heap</A>, such as debug versions of <B>malloc</B>, <B>free</B>, <B>calloc</B>, <B>realloc</B>, <B>new </B>and <B>delete</B>; and heap-monitoring functions, such as <B>_CrtCheckMemory</B> , <B>_CrtDumpMemoryLeaks</B>. It also includes functions, such as <B>_CrtSetDumpClient</B> and <B>_CrtSetAllocHook</B>, allow you to write and install your own <A HREF="_core_writing_your_own_debug_hook_functions.htm">hook functions</A> with special features you need when debugging a complex application. </P>

<P>The C run-time debug functions are available for Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT.</P>
