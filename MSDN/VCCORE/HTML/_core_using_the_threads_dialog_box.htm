<H1><A NAME="_core_using_the_threads_dialog_box"></A>Using the Threads Dialog Box</H1>

<P>When debugging a multithreaded program, you can select a single thread using the <B>Threads</B> dialog box.</P>

<P class=label><B>To display the Threads dialog box</B>

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>From the <B>Debug</B> menu, click <B>Threads</B>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The <B>Threads</B> dialog box displays a list of all threads in the application. Using this list, you can set focus on, suspend, or resume execution of a thread.</P>

<P class=label><B>To set focus on a thread</B>

<OL>
	<LI>In the <B>Theads</B> dialog box, select a thread from the <B>Thread</B> list.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Click <B>Set Focus</B>.</LI>
</OL>

<P class=label><B>To suspend a thread</B>

<OL>
	<LI>In the <B>Theads</B> dialog box, select a thread from the <B>Thread</B> list.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Click <B>Suspend</B>.</LI>
</OL>

<P class=label><B>To resume execution of a thread</B>

<OL>
	<LI>In the <B>Theads</B> dialog box, select a thread from the <B>Thread</B> list.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Click <B>Resume</B>.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The <B>Thread</B> list in the <B>Threads</B> dialog box displays status information on each thread as follows:</P>

<P>The <B>Thread ID</B> column contains the <B>DWORD</B> that uniquely identifies each thread. When you set focus on a thread, an asterisk (*) appears next to its thread ID.</P>

<P>The <B>Suspend</B> column contains the suspension number of each thread. This number, which can vary from 0 through 127, is incremented each time you suspend the thread and decremented each time you resume the thread.</P>

<P>The <B>Priority</B> column contains the thread priority. A thread priority can be any of the following: <B>Idle</B>, <B>Lowest</B>, <B>Below Normal</B>, <B>Normal</B>, <B>Above Normal</B>, <B>Highest</B>, or <B>Time Critical</B>.</P>

<P>The <B>Location</B> column contains the function name or address associated with the thread. You can choose to see either the function name or the address.</P>

<P class=label><B>To view the function name associated with each thread</B>

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>In the <B>Threads</B> dialog box, select <B>Name</B>.</LI>
</UL>

<P class=label><B>To view the address associated with each thread</B>

<UL type=disc>
	<LI>In the <B>Threads</B> dialog box, select <B>Address</B>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>If <B>Name</B> is selected, the current function name appears if it is known by the debugger. If no function is known, the address appears. If <B>Address</B> is selected, the current address appears. </P>

<P class=indent><B><B>Note</B></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are displaying thread locations by <B>Name</B> instead of by <B>Address</B>, each thread is typically shown with the function name in which its EIP currently resides. However, if the EIP is in a location where there are no symbols (for example, in the NT kernel), then Visual C++ displays, in brackets, the name of the topmost function on the stack for which symbols exist.</P>
