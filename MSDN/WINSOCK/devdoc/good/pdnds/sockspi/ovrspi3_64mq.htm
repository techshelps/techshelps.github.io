<h2><a name="_win32_blocking_operations_2"></a>Blocking Operations</h2>
<p>
The notion of blocking in a Windows environment has historically been a very important one. In Windows Sockets 1.1 environments, blocking calls were discouraged since they tend to disable ongoing interaction with the Windowing system, and since they employ a pseudo blocking technique which, for a variety of reasons, does not always work as intended. However, in preemptively scheduled Win32 environments such as Windows 95 and Windows&nbsp;NT, blocking calls make much more sense, can be implemented by native operating system services, and are in fact a generally preferred mechanism. The Windows Sockets 2 API no longer support psuedo blocking, but because the WinSock 1.1 compatibility shims must continue to emulate this behavior, service providers must support this as described below.</p>
