<p>
Windows Sockets transport and name space service providers are DLLs with a single EXPORTED procedure entry point for the service provider initialization function <a href="wsspiref_3xbm.htm"><b>WSPStartup</b></a> or <a href="wsspiref_14vm.htm"><b>NSPStartup</b></a>, respectively. All other service provider functions are made accessible to the WS2_32.DLL via the service provider's dispatch table. Service provider DLL's are loaded into memory by the WS2_32.DLL only when needed, and are unloaded when their services are no longer required. </p>
<p>
The SPI also defines several circumstances in which a transport service provider calls up into the WS2_32.DLL ("upcalls") to obtain DLL support services. The transport service provider DLL is given the WS2_32.DLL's upcall dispatch table via the <i>UpcallTable </i>parameter to <a href="wsspiref_3xbm.htm"><b>WSPStartup</b></a>. </p>
<p>
Service providers should have their file extension changed from ".DLL" to ".WSP" or ".NSP". This requirement is not strict. A service provider will still operate with the WS2_32.DLL with any file extension. </p>
