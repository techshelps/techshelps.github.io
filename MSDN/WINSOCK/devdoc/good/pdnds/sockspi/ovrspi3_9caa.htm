<h3><a name="_win32_creating_event_objects_2"></a>Creating Event Objects</h3>
<p>
The WS2_32.DLLprovides facilities for event object creation to both applications and service providers, although in most instances event objects will be created by applications. Event object services are made available to Windows Sockets service providers via <a href="wsspiref_0gz6.htm"><b>WPUCreateEvent</b></a> simply as a convenience mechanism for any internal processing that may benefit from same. Note that the event object handle is only valid in the context of the calling process. In Win32 environments the realization of event objects is via the native event services provided by the operating system.</p>
