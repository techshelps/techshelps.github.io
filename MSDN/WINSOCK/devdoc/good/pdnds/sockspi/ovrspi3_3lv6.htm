<h3><a name="_win32_event_object_signaling_2"></a>Event Object Signaling</h3>
<p>
<a href="wsspiref_3p0y.htm"><b>WSPEventSelect</b></a> behaves exactly like <a href="wsspiref_74du.htm"><b>WSPAsyncSelect</b></a> except that, rather than cause a Windows message to be sent on the occurrence of any nominated FD_XXX network event (e.g.. FD_READ, FD_WRITE, etc.), a designated event object is set. </p>
<p>
Also, the fact that a particular FD_XXX network event has occurred is "remembered" by the service provider. This is needed since the occurrence of any and all nominated network events will result in a single event object becoming signaled. A call to <a href="wsspiref_2rjm.htm"><b>WSPEnumNetworkEvents</b></a> causes the current contents of the network event memory to be copied to a client-supplied buffer and the network event memory to be cleared. The client may also designate a particular event object to be cleared atomically along with the network event memory. </p>
