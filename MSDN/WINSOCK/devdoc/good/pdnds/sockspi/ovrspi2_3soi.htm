<h3><a name="_win32_transport_service_providers_2"></a>Transport Service Providers</h3>
<p>
A given transport service provider supports one or more protocols. For example, a TCP/IP provider would supply (as a minimum) the TCP and UDP protocols, while an IPX/SPX provider might supply IPX, SPX and SPX II. Each protocol supported by a particular provider is described by a WSAPROTOCOL_INFOW structureure, and the total set of such structureures can be thought of as the catalog of installed protocols. Applications can retrieve the contents of this catalog (see <b>WSAEnumProtocols</b>), and by examining the available WSAPROTOCOL_INFOW structures discover the communications attributes associated with each protocol.</p>

<h4><a name="_win32_spi_layered_protocols_and_protocol_chains_2"></a>SPI: Layered Protocols and Protocol Chains</h4>
<p>
Windows Sockets 2 accommodates the notion of a layered protocol. A layered protocol is one that implements only higher level communications functions, while relying on an underlying transport stack for the actual exchange of data with a remote endpoint. An example of such a layered protocol would be a security layer that adds protocol to the connection establishment process in order to perform authentication and to establish a mutually agreed upon encryption scheme. Such a security protocol would generally require the services of an underlying reliable transport protocol such as TCP or SPX. The term <i>base protocol</i> refers to a protocol such as TCP or SPX which is fully capable of performing data communications with a remote endpoint, and the term <i>layered protocol</i> is used to describe a protocol that cannot stand alone. A <i>protocol chain</i> would then be defined as one or more layered protocols strung together and anchored by a base protocol. </p>
<p>
This stringing together of layered protocols and base protocols into chains can be accomplished by arranging for the layered protocols to support the Windows Sockets 2 SPI at both their upper and lower edges. A special WSAPROTOCOL_INFOW structure is created which refers to the protocol chain as a whole, and which describes the explicit order in which the layered protocols are joined. This is illustrated below. </p>
