<h3><a name="_win32_socket_attribute_flags_and_modes_2"></a>Socket Attribute Flags and Modes</h3>
<p>
There are several socket attributes which can be indicated via the <i>flags </i>parameter in <a href="wsspiref_46ia.htm"><b>WSPSocket</b></a>. The WSA_FLAG_OVERLAPPED flag indicates that a socket will be used for overlapped I/O operations. Support of this attribute is mandatory for all service providers. See <a href="ovrspi3_1fci.htm">Overlapped I/O</a> for more information. Note that creating a socket with the overlapped attribute has no impact on whether a socket is currently in the blocking or non-blocking mode. Sockets created with the overlapped attribute may be used to perform overlapped I/O, and doing so does not change the blocking mode of a socket. Since overlapped I/O operations do not block, the blocking mode of a socket is irrelelvant for these operations.</p>
<p>
Four additional attribute flags are used when creating sockets that are to be used for multipoint and/or multicast operations, and support for these attributes is optional. Providers that support multipoint attributes indicate this via the XP1_SUPPPORT_MULTIPOINT bit in their respective WSAPROTOCOL_INFOW structures. See <a href="wsspiref_46ia.htm"><b>WSPSocket</b></a> and section <a href="ovrspi3_8jg2.htm">SPI: Protocol-Independent Multicast and Multipoint</a> for the definition and usage of each of these flags. Only sockets that are created with multipoint related attributes can be used in the <a href="wsspiref_92lu.htm"><b>WSPJoinLeaf</b></a> function for creating multipoint sessions. </p>
<p>
A socket is in one of two modes, blocking and non-blocking, at any time. Sockets are created in the blocking mode by default, and can be changed to the non-blocking mode by calling <a href="wsspiref_74du.htm"><b>WSPAsyncSelect</b></a>, <a href="wsspiref_3p0y.htm"><b>WSPEventSelect</b></a>, or <a href="wsspiref_9baq.htm"><b>WSPIoctl</b></a>. A socket can be switched back to the blocking mode by using <b>WSPIoctl</b> if no <b>WSPAsyncSelect</b> or <b>WSPEventSelect</b> is active. The mode for a socket only affects those functions which may block, and does not affect overlapped I/O operations. See section <a href="ovrspi3_64mq.htm">Blocking Operations</a> for more information. </p>
