<p>
In some instances sockets joined to a multipoint session may have some behavioral differences from point-to-point sockets. For example, a d_leaf socket in a rooted data plane scheme can only send information to the d_root participant. This creates a need for the client to be able to indicate the intended use of a socket coincident with its creation. This is done through four multipoint attribute flags that can be set via the <i>dwFlags </i>parameter in <b>WSPSocket</b>:
<ul>
<li>
WSA_FLAG_MULTIPOINT_C_ROOT, for the creation of a socket acting as a c_root, and only allowed if a rooted control plane is indicated in the corresponding WSAPROTOCOL_INFOW entry.</li>
<li>
WSA_FLAG_MULTIPOINT_C_LEAF, for the creation of a socket acting as a c_leaf, and only allowed if XP1_SUPPORT_MULTIPOINT is indicated in the corresponding WSAPROTOCOL_INFOW entry.</li>
<li>
WSA_FLAG_MULTIPOINT_D_ROOT, for the creation of a socket acting as a d_root, and only allowed if a rooted data plane is indicated in the corresponding WSAPROTOCOL_INFOW entry.</li>
<li>
WSA_FLAG_MULTIPOINT_D_LEAF, for the creation of a socket acting as a d_leaf, and only allowed if XP1_SUPPORT_MULTIPOINT is indicated in the corresponding WSAPROTOCOL_INFOW entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When creating a multipoint socket, exactly one of the two control plane flags, and one of the two data plane flags must be set in <a href="wsspiref_46ia.htm"><b>WSPSocket</b></a>'s <i>dwFlags </i>parameter. Thus, the four possibilities for creating multipoint sockets are: "c_root/d_root", "c_root/d_leaf", "c_leaf/d_root", or "c_leaf /d_leaf". </p>
