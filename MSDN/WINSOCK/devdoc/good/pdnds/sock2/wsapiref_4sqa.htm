<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The <b>sendto</b> function is used to write outgoing data on a socket. For message-oriented sockets, care must be taken not to exceed the maximum packet size of the underlying subnets, which can be obtained by using <a href="wsapiref_8qcy.htm"><b>getsockopt</b></a> to retrieve the value of socket option SO_MAX_MSG_SIZE. If the data is too long to pass atomically through the underlying protocol, the error <a href="errors_0oaa.htm#_win32_wsaemsgsize_2">WSAEMSGSIZE</a> is returned and no data is transmitted. </p>
<p>
The <i>to</i> parameter can be any valid address in the socket's address family, including a broadcast or any multicast address. To send to a broadcast address, an application must have used <a href="wsapiref_94aa.htm"><b>setsockopt</b></a> with SO_BROADCAST enabled. Otherwise, <b>sendto</b> will fail with the error code <a href="errors_0oaa.htm#_win32_wsaeacces_2">WSAEACCES</a>. For TCP/IP, an application can send to any multicast address (without becoming a group member).</p>
<p>
If the socket is unbound, unique values are assigned to the local association by the system, and the socket is then marked as bound. An application can use <a href="wsapiref_273m.htm"><b>getsockname</b></a> to determine the local socket name in this case.</p>
<p>
The successful completion of a <b>sendto</b> does not indicate that the data was successfully delivered.</p>
<p>
The <b>sendto</b> function is normally used on a connectionless socket to send a datagram to a specific peer socket identified by the <i>to</i> parameter. Even if the connectionless socket has been previously connected to a specific address, the <i>to</i> parameter overrides the destination address for that particular datagram only. On a connection-oriented socket, the <i>to</i> and <i>tolen </i>parameters are ignored, making <b>sendto</b> equivalent to <a href="wsapiref_6quq.htm"><b>send</b></a>.</p>
<p>
For sockets using IP (version 4):</p>
<p>
To send a broadcast (on a SOCK_DGRAM only), the address in the <i>to</i> parameter should be constructed using the special IP address INADDR_BROADCAST (defined in WINSOCK2.H), together with the intended port number. It is generally inadvisable for a broadcast datagram to exceed the size at which fragmentation can occur, which implies that the data portion of the datagram (excluding headers) should not exceed 512 bytes.</p>
<p>
If no buffer space is available within the transport system to hold the data to be transmitted, <b>sendto</b> will block unless the socket has been placed in a nonblocking mode. On nonblocking, stream oriented sockets, the number of bytes written can be between 1 and the requested length, depending on buffer availability on both the client and server systems. The <a href="wsapiref_1ab6.htm"><b>select</b></a>, <a href="wsapiref_6jn6.htm"><b>WSAAsyncSelect</b></a> or <a href="wsapiref_34aa.htm"><b>WSAEventSelect</b></a> function can be used to determine when it is possible to send more data.</p>
<p>
Calling <b>sendto</b> with a <i>len</i> of zero is permissible and will return zero as a valid value. For message-oriented sockets, a zero-length transport datagram is sent.</p>
<p>
The <i>flags</i> parameter can be used to influence the behavior of the function invocation beyond the options specified for the associated socket. The semantics of this function are determined by the socket options and the <i>flags</i> parameter. The latter is constructed by or-ing the following values:</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=41%>Value</th>
<th align=left width=59%>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>MSG_DONTROUTE</td>
<td width=59%>Specifies that the data should not be subject to routing. A Windows Sockets service provider can choose to ignore this flag.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=41%>MSG_OOB</td>
<td width=59%>Send out-of-band data (stream-style socket such as SOCK_STREAM only. Also see <a href="../../../live/pdnds/sockspi/wsanxref_9fqq.htm">DECnet Out-Of-band data</a> for a discussion of this topic.)</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<h4>Return Values</h4>
<p>
If no error occurs, <b>sendto</b> returns the total number of bytes sent, which can be less than the number indicated by <i>len</i>. Otherwise, a value of SOCKET_ERROR is returned, and a specific error code can be retrieved by calling <a href="wsapiref_2tiq.htm"><b>WSAGetLastError</b></a>.</p>
