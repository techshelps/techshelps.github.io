<h3><a name="_win32_select_and_fd___2"></a>select and FD_*</h3>
<p>
Because a SOCKET is no longer represented by the UNIX-style "small non-negative integer", the implementation of the <b>select</b> function was changed in Windows Sockets. Each set of sockets is still represented by the fd_set type, but instead of being stored as a bitmask the set is implemented as an array of SOCKETs. To avoid potential problems, applications must adhere to the use of the FD_XXX macros to set, initialize, clear, and check the fd_set structures.</p>
