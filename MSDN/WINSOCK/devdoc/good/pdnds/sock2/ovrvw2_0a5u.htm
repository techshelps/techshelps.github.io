<h2><a name="_win32_making_transport_protocols_available_to_windows_sockets_2"></a>Making Transport Protocols Available To Windows Sockets</h2>
<p>
A transport protocol must be properly installed on the system and registered with Windows Sockets to be accessible to an application. The WS2_32.DLL exports a set of functions to facilitate the registration process. This includes creating a new registration and removing an existing one.</p>
<p>
When new registrations are created, the caller (that is, the stack vendor's installation script) supplies one or more filled in <a href="strucetc_4cfm.htm">WSAPROTOCOL_INFO</a> structures containing a complete set of information about the protocol. (See the <a href="../sockspi/ovrspi_1khe.htm">Welcome To Windows Sockets 2 SPI</a> for information on how this is accomplished.) Any transport stack that is installed this way will be referred to as a Windows Sockets service provider.</p>
<p>
The Windows Sockets 2 SDK includes a small Windows applet, SPORDER.EXE, that allows the user to view and modify the order in which service providers are enumerated. By using this SPORDER.EXE, a user can manually establish a particular TCP/IP protocol stack as the default TCP/IP provider if more than one such stack is present.</p>
<p>
The SPORDER.EXE applet exports functions from SPORDER.DLL to reorder the service providers. As a result, installation applications can use the interface of SPORDER.DLL to programmatically reorder service providers to suit their needs. </p>
