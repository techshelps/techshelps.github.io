<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The <b>WSARecvFrom</b> function provides functionality over and above the standard <b>recvfrom</b> function in three important areas:
<ol>
<li>
It can be used in conjunction with overlapped sockets to perform overlapped receive operations.</li>
<li>
It allows multiple receive buffers to be specified making it applicable to the scatter/gather type of I/O.</li>
<li>
The <i>lpFlags </i>parameter is both an input and an output parameter, allowing applications to sense the output state of the MSG_PARTIAL flag bit. Note however, that the MSG_PARTIAL flag bit is not supported by all protocols.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The <b>WSARecvFrom</b> functions is used primarily on a connectionless socket specified by <i>s.</i> The socket's local address must be known. For server applications, this is usually done explicitly through <b>bind</b>. Explicit binding is discouraged for client applications. For client applications using this function the socket can become bound implicitly to a local address through <a href="wsapiref_4sqa.htm"><b>sendto</b></a>, <a href="wsapiref_752q.htm"><b>WSASendTo</b></a>, or <a href="wsapiref_7dv6.htm"><b>WSAJoinLeaf</b></a>.</p>
<p>
For overlapped sockets, this function is used to post one or more buffers into which incoming data will be placed as it becomes available on a (possibly connected) socket, after which the application-specified completion indication (invocation of the completion routine or setting of an event object) occurs. If the operation does not complete immediately, the final completion status is retrieved through the completion routine or <a href="wsapiref_5kky.htm"><b>WSAGetOverlappedResult</b></a>. Also, the values indicated by <i>lpFrom</i> and <i>lpFromlen </i>are not updated until completion is itself indicated. Applications must not use or disturb these values until they have been updated, therefore the application must not use automatic (that is, stack-based) variables for these parameters.</p>
<p>
If both <i>lpOverlapped</i> and <i>lpCompletionRoutine</i> are NULL, the socket in this function will be treated as a nonoverlapped socket.</p>
<p>
For nonoverlapped sockets, the blocking semantics are identical to that of the standard <a href="wsapiref_4z1u.htm"><b>WSARecv</b></a><b> </b>function and the <i>lpOverlapped</i> and <i>lpCompletionRoutine </i>parameters are ignored. Any data that has already been received and buffered by the transport will be copied into the supplied user buffers. For the case of a blocking socket with no data currently having been received and buffered by the transport, the call will block until data is received.</p>
<p>
The supplied buffers are filled in the order in which they appear in the array indicated by <i>lpBuffers</i>, and the buffers are packed so that no holes are created.</p>
<p>
The array of <a href="strucetc_5ape.htm"><b>WSABUF</b></a> structures pointed to by the <i>lpBuffers </i>parameter is transient. If this operation completes in an overlapped manner, it is the service provider's responsibility to capture these <b>WSABUF</b> structures before returning from this call. This enables applications to build stack-based <a href="strucetc_5ape.htm"><b>WSABUF</b></a> arrays.</p>
<p>
For connectionless socket types, the address from which the data originated is copied to the buffer indicated by <i>lpFrom</i>. The value pointed to by <i>lpFromlen</i> is initialized to the size of this buffer, and is modified on completion to indicate the actual size of the address stored there. As noted previously for overlapped sockets, the <i>lpFrom</i> and <i>lpFromlen</i> parameters are not updated until after the overlapped I/O has completed. The memory pointed to by these parameters must, therefore, remain available to the service provider and cannot be allocated on the application's stack frame. The <i>lpFrom</i> and <i>lpFromlen</i> parameters are ignored for connection-oriented sockets.</p>
<p>
For byte stream-style sockets (for example, type SOCK_STREAM), incoming data is placed into the buffers until the buffers are filled, until the connection is closed, or until the internally buffered data is exhausted. Regardless of whether or not the incoming data fills all the buffers, the completion indication occurs for overlapped sockets. For message-oriented sockets, an incoming message is placed into the supplied buffers up to the total size of the buffers supplied, and the completion indication occurs for overlapped sockets. If the message is larger than the buffers supplied, the buffers are filled with the first part of the message. If the MSG_PARTIAL feature is supported by the underlying service provider, the MSG_PARTIAL flag is set in <i>lpFlags</i> and subsequent receive operation(s) will retrieve the rest of the message. If MSG_PARTIAL is not supported but the protocol is reliable, <b>WSARecvFrom</b> generates the error WSAEMSGSIZE and a subsequent receive operation with a larger buffer can be used to retrieve the entire message. Otherwise, (that is, the protocol is unreliable and does not support MSG_PARTIAL), the excess data is lost, and <b>WSARecvFrom</b> generates the error WSAEMSGSIZE.</p>
<p>
The <i>lpFlags</i> parameter can be used to influence the behavior of the function invocation beyond the options specified for the associated socket. That is, the semantics of this function are determined by the socket options and the <i>lpFlags</i> parameter. The latter is constructed by or-ing any of the following values:</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=31%>Value</th>
<th align=left width=69%>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=31%>MSG_PEEK</td>
<td width=69%>Peek at the incoming data. The data is copied into the buffer but is not removed from the input queue. This flag is valid only for nonoverlapped sockets.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=31%>MSG_OOB</td>
<td width=69%>Process out-of-band data. (See section <a href="../../../live/pdnds/sockspi/wsanxref_9fqq.htm">DECnet Out-Of-band data</a> for a discussion of this topic.)</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=31%>MSG_PARTIAL</td>
<td width=69%>This flag is for message-oriented sockets only. On output, indicates that the data supplied is a portion of the message transmitted by the sender. Remaining portions of the message will be supplied in subsequent receive operations. A subsequent receive operation with MSG_PARTIAL flag cleared indicates end of sender's message.<p>
As an input parameter indicates that the receive operation should complete even if only part of a message has been received by the service provider.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
For message-oriented sockets, the MSG_PARTIAL bit is set in the <i>lpFlags</i> parameter if a partial message is received. If a complete message is received, MSG_PARTIAL is cleared in <i>lpFlags</i>. In the case of delayed completion, the value pointed to by <i>lpFlags</i> is not updated. When completion has been indicated the application should call <b>WSAGetOverlappedResult</b> and examine the flags pointed to by the <i>lpdwFlags</i> parameter.</p>
<h4>Overlapped socket I/O</h4>
<p>
If an overlapped operation completes immediately, <b>WSARecvFrom</b> returns a value of zero and the <i>lpNumberOfBytesRecvd</i> parameter is updated with the number of bytes received and the flag bits pointed by the <i>lpFlags</i> parameter are also updated. If the overlapped operation is successfully initiated and will complete later, <b>WSARecvFrom</b> returns SOCKET_ERROR and indicates error code WSA_IO_PENDING. In this case, <i>lpNumberOfBytesRecvd</i> and <i>lpFlags</i> is not updated. When the overlapped operation completes the amount of data transferred is indicated either through the <i>cbTransferred</i> parameter in the completion routine (if specified), or through the <i>lpcbTransfer</i> parameter in <a href="wsapiref_5kky.htm"><b>WSAGetOverlappedResult</b></a>. Flag values are obtained either through the <i>dwFlags </i>parameter of the completion routine, or by examining the <i>lpdwFlags </i>parameter of <a href="wsapiref_5kky.htm"><b>WSAGetOverlappedResult</b></a>.</p>
<p>
The <b>WSARecvFrom</b> function can be called from within the completion routine of a previous <b>WSARecv</b>, <b>WSARecvFrom</b>, <b>WSASend</b> or<b> WSASendTo</b> function. For a given socket, I/O completion routines will <i>not</i> be nested. This permits time-sensitive data transmissions to occur entirely within a preemptive context.</p>
<p>
The <i>lpOverlapped</i> parameter must be valid for the duration of the overlapped operation. If multiple I/O operations are simultaneously outstanding, each must reference a separate <a href="strucetc_0gz6.htm"><b>WSAOVERLAPPED</b></a> structure.</p>
<p>
If the <i>lpCompletionRoutine</i> parameter is NULL, the <i>hEvent</i> field of <i>lpOverlapped</i> is signaled when the overlapped operation completes if it contains a valid event object handle. An application can use <a href="wsapiref_1p4i.htm"><b>WSAWaitForMultipleEvents</b></a> or <a href="wsapiref_5kky.htm"><b>WSAGetOverlappedResult</b></a> to wait or poll on the event object.</p>
<p>
If <i>lpCompletionRoutine</i> is not NULL, the <i>hEvent</i> field is ignored and can be used by the application to pass context information to the completion routine. A caller that passes a non-NULL <i>lpCompletionRoutine</i> and later calls <b>WSAGetOverlappedResult</b> for the same overlapped IO request may not set the <i>fWait</i> parameter for that invocation of <b>WSAGetOverlappedResult</b> to TRUE. In this case the usage of the <i>hEvent</i> field is undefined, and attempting to wait on the <i>hEvent</i> field would produce unpredictable results.</p>
<p>
The completion routine follows the same rules as stipulated for Win32 file I/O completion routines. The completion routine will <i>not</i> be invoked until the thread is in an alertable wait state such as can occur when the function <a href="wsapiref_1p4i.htm"><b>WSAWaitForMultipleEvents</b></a> with the <i>fAlertable</i> parameter set to TRUE is invoked.</p>
<p>
The transport providers allow an application to invoke send and receive operations from within the context of the socket I/O completion routine, and guarantee that, for a given socket, I/O completion routines will <i>not</i> be nested. This permits time-sensitive data transmissions to occur entirely within a preemptive context.</p>
<p>
The prototype of the completion routine is as follows:</p>
<pre><code><b>void CALLBACK CompletionROUTINE(
  IN DWORD </b><i>dwError</i><b>, </b>
<b>  IN DWORD </b><i>cbTransferred</i><b>, </b>
<b>  IN LPWSAOVERLAPPED </b><i>lpOverlapped</i><b>, </b>
<b>  IN DWORD </b><i>dwFlags</i>
<b>);</b>
</code></pre>
<p>
The <b>CompletionRoutine</b> is a placeholder for an application-defined or library-defined function name. The <i>dwError</i> specifies the completion status for the overlapped operation as indicated by <i>lpOverlapped</i>. The <i>cbTransferred</i> specifies the number of bytes received. The <i>dwFlags</i> parameter contains information that would have appeared in <i>lpFlags </i>if the receive operation had completed immediately. This function does not return a value.</p>
<p>
Returning from this function allows invocation of another pending completion routine for this socket. When using <a href="wsapiref_1p4i.htm"><b>WSAWaitForMultipleEvents</b></a>, all waiting completion routines are called before the alertable thread's wait is satisfied with a return code of WSA_IO_COMPLETION. The completion routines can be called in any order, not necessarily in the same order the overlapped operations are completed. However, the posted buffers are guaranteed to be filled in the same order they are supplied.</p>
<h4>Return Values</h4>
<p>
If no error occurs and the receive operation has completed immediately, <b>WSARecvFrom</b> returns zero. In this case, the completion routine will have already been scheduled to be called once the calling thread is in the alertable state. Otherwise, a value of SOCKET_ERROR is returned, and a specific error code can be retrieved by calling <a href="wsapiref_2tiq.htm"><b>WSAGetLastError</b></a>. The error code WSA_IO_PENDING indicates that the overlapped operation has been successfully initiated and that completion will be indicated at a later time. Any other error code indicates that the overlapped operation was not successfully initiated and no completion indication will occur.</p>
