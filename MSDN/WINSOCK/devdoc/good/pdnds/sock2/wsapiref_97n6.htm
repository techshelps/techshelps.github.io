<h4>Remarks</h4>
<p>
The <b>WSASend</b> function provides functionality over and above the standard <b>send</b> function in two important areas:
<ol>
<li>
It can be used in conjunction with overlapped sockets to perform overlapped send operations.</li>
<li>
It allows multiple send buffers to be specified making it applicable to the scatter/gather type of I/O.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The <b>WSASend</b> function is used to write outgoing data from one or more buffers on a connection-oriented socket specified by <i>s. </i>It can also be used, however, on connectionless sockets that have a stipulated default peer address established through the <a href="wsapiref_8m7m.htm"><b>connect</b></a> or <a href="wsapiref_8kc2.htm"><b>WSAConnect</b></a> function.</p>
<p>
For overlapped sockets (created using <a href="wsapiref_533m.htm"><b>WSASocket</b></a> with flag WSA_FLAG_OVERLAPPED) sending information uses overlapped I/O, unless both <i>lpOverlapped</i> and <i>lpCompletionRoutine</i> are NULL. In that case,  the socket is treated as a nonoverlapped socket. A completion indication will occur, invoking of the completion routine or setting of an event object, when the supplied buffer(s) have been consumed by the transport. If the operation does not complete immediately, the final completion status is retrieved through the completion routine or <a href="wsapiref_5kky.htm"><b>WSAGetOverlappedResult</b></a>.</p>
<p>
If both <i>lpOverlapped</i> and<i> lpCompletionRoutine</i> are NULL, the socket in this function will be treated as a non-overlapped socket.</p>
<p>
For nonoverlapped sockets, the last two parameters (<i>lpOverlapped, lpCompletionRoutine</i>) are ignored and <b>WSASend</b> adopts the same blocking semantics as <a href="wsapiref_6quq.htm"><b>send</b></a>. Data is copied from the supplied buffer(s) into the transport's buffer. If the socket is nonblocking and stream oriented, and there is not sufficient space in the transport's buffer, <b>WSASend</b> will return with only part of the application's buffers having been consumed. Given the same buffer situation and a blocking socket, <b>WSASend</b> will block until all of the application's buffer contents have been consumed.</p>
<p>
The array of <a href="strucetc_5ape.htm"><b>WSABUF</b></a> structures pointed to by the <i>lpBuffers </i>parameter is transient. If this operation is completed in an overlapped manner, it is the service provider's responsibility to capture these <b>WSABUF</b> structures before returning from this call. This enables applications to build stack-based <b>WSABUF</b> arrays.</p>
<p>
For message-oriented sockets, care must be taken not to exceed the maximum message size of the underlying provider, which can be obtained by getting the value of socket option SO_MAX_MSG_SIZE. If the data is too long to pass atomically through the underlying protocol the error WSAEMSGSIZE is returned, and no data is transmitted.</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  Tthe successful completion of a <b>WSASend</b> does not indicate that the data was successfully delivered.</p>
<p>
The <i>dwFlags</i> paramter can be used to influence the behavior of the function invocation beyond the options specified for the associated socket. That is, the semantics of this function are determined by the socket options and the <i>dwFlags</i> parameter. The latter is constructed by or-ing any of the following values:</p>
<table cellspacing=4 cols=2>
<tr valign=top>
<th align=left width=33%>Value</th>
<th align=left width=67%>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=33%>MSG_DONTROUTE</td>
<td width=67%>Specifies that the data should not be subject to routing. A Windows Sockets service provider can choose to ignore this flag.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=33%>MSG_OOB</td>
<td width=67%>Send out-of-band data on a stream-style socket such as SOCK_STREAM only. (See section <a href="../../../live/pdnds/sockspi/wsanxref_9fqq.htm">DECnet Out-Of-band data</a> for a discussion of this topic.)</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=33%>MSG_PARTIAL</td>
<td width=67%>Specifies that <i>lpBuffers</i> only contains a partial message. Note that the error code WSAEOPNOTSUPP will be returned by transports that do not support partial message transmissions.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<h4>Overlapped socket I/O</h4>
<p>
If an overlapped operation completes immediately, <b>WSASend</b> returns a value of zero and the <i>lpNumberOfBytesSent</i> parameter is updated with the number of bytes sent. If the overlapped operation is successfully initiated and will complete later, <b>WSASend</b> returns SOCKET_ERROR and indicates error code WSA_IO_PENDING. In this case, <i>lpNumberOfBytesSent</i> is not updated. When the overlapped operation completes the amount of data transferred is indicated either through the <i>cbTransferred</i> parameter in the completion routine (if specified), or through the <i>lpcbTransfer</i> parameter in <a href="wsapiref_5kky.htm"><b>WSAGetOverlappedResult</b></a>.</p>
<p>
The <b>WSASend</b> function can be called from within the completion routine of a previous <b>WSARecv</b>, <b>WSARecvFrom</b>, <b>WSASend</b> or <b>WSASendTo</b> function. This permits time-sensitive data transmissions to occur entirely within a preemptive context.</p>
<p>
The <i>lpOverlapped</i> parameter must be valid for the duration of the overlapped operation. If multiple I/O operations are simultaneously outstanding, each must reference a separate <a href="strucetc_0gz6.htm"><b>WSAOVERLAPPED</b></a> structure. </p>
<p>
If the <i>lpCompletionRoutine</i> parameter is NULL, the <i>hEvent</i> field of <i>lpOverlapped</i> is signaled when the overlapped operation completes if it contains a valid event object handle. An application can use <b>WSAWaitForMultipleEvents</b> or <b>WSAGetOverlappedResult</b> to wait or poll on the event object.</p>
<p>
If <i>lpCompletionRoutine</i> is not NULL, the <i>hEvent</i> field is ignored and can be used by the application to pass context information to the completion routine. A caller that passes a non-NULL <i>lpCompletionRoutine</i> and later calls <b>WSAGetOverlappedResult</b> for the same overlapped IO request may not set the <i>fWait</i> parameter for that invocation of <b>WSAGetOverlappedResult</b> to TRUE. In this case the usage of the <i>hEvent</i> field is undefined, and attempting to wait on the <i>hEvent</i> field would produce unpredictable results.</p>
<p>
The completion routine follows the same rules as stipulated for Win32 file I/O completion routines. The completion routine will <i>not</i> be invoked until the thread is in an alertable wait state such as can occur when the function <b>WSAWaitForMultipleEvents</b> with the <i>fAlertable</i> parameter set to TRUE is invoked.</p>
<p>
The transport providers allow an application to invoke send and receive operations from within the context of the socket I/O completion routine, and guarantee that, for a given socket, I/O completion routines will <i>not</i> be nested. This permits time-sensitive data transmissions to occur entirely within a preemptive context.</p>
<p>
The prototype of the completion routine is as follows:</p>
<pre><code><b>void CALLBACK CompletionROUTINE(
  IN DWORD </b><i>dwError</i><b>,</b>
<b>  IN DWORD </b><i>cbTransferred</i><b>,</b>
<b>  IN LPWSAOVERLAPPED </b><i>lpOverlapped</i><b>,</b>
<b>  IN DWORD </b><i>dwFlags</i>
<b>);</b>
</code></pre>
<p>
The <b>CompletionRoutine</b> function is a placeholder for an application-defined or library-defined function name. <i>dwError</i> specifies the completion status for the overlapped operation as indicated by <i>lpOverlapped</i>. <i>cbTransferred</i> specifies the number of bytes sent. Currently there are no flag values defined and <i>dwFlags</i> will be zero. This function does not return a value.</p>
<p>
Returning from this function allows invocation of another pending completion routine for this socket. All waiting completion routines are called before the alertable thread's wait is satisfied with a return code of WSA_IO_COMPLETION. The completion routines can be called in any order, not necessarily in the same order the overlapped operations are completed. However, the posted buffers are guaranteed to be sent in the same order they are supplied.</p>
<h4>Return Values</h4>
<p>
If no error occurs and the send operation has completed immediately, <b>WSASend</b> returns zero. In this case, the completion routine will have already been scheduled to be called once the calling thread is in the alertable state. Otherwise, a value of SOCKET_ERROR is returned, and a specific error code can be retrieved by calling <a href="wsapiref_2tiq.htm"><b>WSAGetLastError</b></a>. The error code WSA_IO_PENDING indicates that the overlapped operation has been successfully initiated and that completion will be indicated at a later time. Any other error code indicates that the overlapped operation was not successfully initiated and no completion indication will occur.</p>
