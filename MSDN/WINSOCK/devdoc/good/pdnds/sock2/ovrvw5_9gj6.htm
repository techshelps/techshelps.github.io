<p>
In the control plane, there are some significant semantic differences between a c_root socket and a regular point-to-point socket:
<ol>
<li>
the c_root socket can be used in <a href="wsapiref_7dv6.htm"><b>WSAJoinLeaf</b></a> to join a new a leaf; </li>
<li>
placing a c_root socket into the listening mode (by callings <a href="wsapiref_07hu.htm"><b>listen</b></a>) does not preclude the c_root socket from being used in a call to <b>WSAJoinLeaf</b> to add a new leaf, or for sending and receiving multipoint data; </li>
<li>
the closing of a c_root socket will cause all the associated c_leaf sockets to get FD_CLOSE notification. </li>
</ol>
<p>
There is no semantic differences between a c_leaf socket and a regular socket in the control plane, except that the c_leaf socket can be used in <b>WSAJoinLeaf</b>, and the use of c_leaf socket in <b>listen</b> indicates that only multipoint connection requests should be accepted.</p>
<p>
In the data plane, the semantic differences between the d_root socket and a regular point-to-point socket are 
<ol>
<li>
the data sent on the d_root socket will be delivered to all the leaves in the same multipoint session; </li>
<li>
the data received on the d_root socket may be from any of the leaves. </li>
</ol>
<p>
The d_leaf socket in the rooted data plane has no semantic difference from the regular socket, however, in the non-rooted data plane, the data sent on the d_leaf socket will go to all the other leaf nodes, and the data received could be from any other leaf nodes. As mentioned earlier, the information about whether the d_leaf socket is in a rooted or non-rooted data plane is contained in the corresponding <a href="strucetc_4cfm.htm">WSAPROTOCOL_INFO</a> structure for the socket.</p>
