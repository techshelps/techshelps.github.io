<h3><a name="_win32_conventions_for_new_functions_2"></a>Conventions for New Functions</h3>
<p>
Windows Sockets 2, with its expanded scope, takes the socket paradigm beyond the original design. As a result, a number of new functions have been added. These have been assigned names that begin with "WSA." In all but a few instances, these new functions are expanded versions of existing functions from BSD sockets. </p>
<p>
The new functions are described in the reference section of the document, following the conventions of the Platform SDK. The new functions are also listed in <a href="ovrvw2_4g6q.htm"><i>Summary of New Functions</i></a>.</p>
