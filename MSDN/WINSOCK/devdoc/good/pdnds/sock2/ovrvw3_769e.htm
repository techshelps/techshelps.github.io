<h3><a name="_win32_default_state_for_a_socket_s_overlapped_attribute_2"></a>Default state for a socket's overlapped attribute</h3>
<p>
The <b>socket</b> function created sockets with the overlapped attribute set by default in the first WSOCK32.DLL, the 32-bit version of Windows Sockets 1.1. In order to insure backward compatibility with currently deployed WSOCK32.DLL implementations, this will continue to be the case for WinSock 2 as well. That is, in WinSock 2, sockets created with the <b>socket </b>function will have the overlapped attribute. However, in order to be more compatible with the rest of the Win32 API, sockets created with <b>WSASocket</b> will, by default, NOT have the overlapped attribute. This attribute will only be applied if the WSA_FLAG_OVERLAPPED bit is set.</p>
