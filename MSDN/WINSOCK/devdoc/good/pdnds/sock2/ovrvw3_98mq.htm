<h3><a name="_win32_renamed_functions_2"></a>Renamed functions</h3>
<p>
In two cases it was necessary to rename functions which are used in Berkeley Sockets in order to avoid clashes with other Win32 API functions.</p>

<h4><a name="_win32_close_closesocket_2"></a>close &amp; closesocket</h4>
<p>
Sockets are represented by standard file descriptors in Berkeley Sockets, so the <b>close</b> function can be used to close sockets as well as regular files. While nothing in the Windows Sockets prevents an implementation from using regular file handles to identify sockets, nothing requires it either. Sockets must be closed by using the <a href="wsapiref_714i.htm"><b>closesocket</b></a> routine. Using the <b>close</b> routine to close a socket is incorrect and the effects of doing so are undefined by this specification.</p>

<h4><a name="_win32_ioctl_ioctlsocket_wsaioctl_2"></a>ioctl &amp; ioctlsocket/WSAIoctl</h4>
<p>
Various C language run-time systems use the <b>ioctl</b> routine for purposes unrelated to Windows Sockets. As a consequence, the <a href="wsapiref_7dde.htm"><b>ioctlsocket</b></a> function and the <b><u>WSAIoctl</u></b> function were defined to handle socket functions that were performed by <b>ioctl</b> and <b>fcntl</b> in the Berkeley Software Distribution.</p>
