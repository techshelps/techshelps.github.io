<h1><a name="_win32_wsaoverlapped_2"></a>WSAOVERLAPPED</h1>
<p>
The <b>WSAOVERLAPPED</b> structure provides a communication medium between the initiation of an overlapped I/O operation and its subsequent completion. The <b>WSAOVERLAPPED</b> structure is designed to be compatible with the Win32 <b>OVERLAPPED</b> structure:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct _WSAOVERLAPPED {
    DWORD        Internal;
    DWORD        InternalHigh;
    DWORD        Offset;
    DWORD        OffsetHigh;
    WSAEVENT     hEvent;
} WSAOVERLAPPED, FAR * LPWSAOVERLAPPED;
 </code></pre>

<b>Internal</b></dt>
<dd>
This reserved field is used internally by the entity that implements overlapped I/O. For service providers that create sockets as installable file system (IFS) handles, this field is used by the underlying operating system. Other service providers (non-IFS providers) are free to use this field as necessary.</dd>
<dt>
<b>InternalHigh</b></dt>
<dd>

<dt>
<b>OffsetT</b></dt>

<b>OffsetHigh</b></dt>
<dd>

<dt>
<b>Event</b></dt>
<dd>
If an overlapped I/O operation is issued without an I/O completion routine (<i>lpCompletionRoutine</i> is NULL), then this field should either contain a valid handle to a <b>WSAEVENT</b> object or be NULL. If <i>lpCompletionRoutine</i> is non-NULL then applications are free to use this field as necessary.
