<h1><a name="_win32_new_concepts_additions_and_changes_for_windows_sockets_2_2"></a>New Concepts, Additions and Changes for Windows Sockets 2</h1>
<p>
This section summarizes Windows Sockets 2 and describes the major changes and additions it contains. Windows Sockets 2 differs from Windows Sockets 1.1 in several ways, particularly in the architecture. The new architecture, discussed in <a href="ovrvw2_5kky.htm"><b>Windows Sockets 2 Architecture</b></a>, provides the foundation for many of the new concepts that have been incorporated into Windows Sockets 2.</p>
<p>
An overview of the additions and changes in Windows Sockets 2 follows the discussion of the new architecture. </p>
<p>
Many of the functions in Windows Sockets 2 are the same as in the other versions of sockets. However, there are several new functions, which are summarized in <a href="ovrvw2_4g6q.htm"><b>Summary of New Functions</b></a>. For detailed information on how to use a specific function or feature, refer to the Reference section.</p>
