<p>
The standard mechanisms by which GQOS provides applications quality of service capabilities will fulfill the requirements for the majority of applications. In some situations, however, service quality parameters not available with standard GQOS mechanisms may need to be implemented. The <b>ProviderSpecific</b> buffer interface is provided for those situations.</p>
<p>
The <b>ProviderSpecific</b> buffer specifically includes a length field and a pointer to a buffer, which may contain one or more (GQOS) objects. The format of each object is as follows:
<ul>
