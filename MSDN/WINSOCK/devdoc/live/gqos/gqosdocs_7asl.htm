<h1><a name="_gqos_gqos_documentation_structure"></a>GQOS Documentation Structure</h1>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
To facilitate explanation, the Generic Quality of Service (GQOS) documentation divides the GQOS components into three categories:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="aboutgqos_08z7.htm">Application-Driven GQOS Components</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="aboutgqos_43qr.htm">Network-Driven GQOS Components</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="aboutgqos_5e5v.htm">Policy-Driven GQOS Components</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>
This division is purely for the sake of convenience and clarity. Though each of these GQOS components is in some way initiated at the client or end-node, and in pure semantics, is initiated by the application, the impact of the component may be greatest elsewhere.</p>
<p>
For an example (which may be clearer once the 802.1p GQOS component is further explained), the 802.1p precedence bits are actually set in the end-node's network stack, and is done so because an application initiated a sequence of GQOS events that eventually triggered the setting of the bits. The cause of this bit-setting, then, could be argued to be the application's initiation of GQOS service (thus application-driven). However, because the effect of setting the priority on 802.1p bits has the greatest impact when the packets associated with this session cross their local segment, 802.1p is included in the <a href="aboutgqos_43qr.htm">Network-Driven GQOS Components</a> category, and <i>not</i> in the <a href="aboutgqos_08z7.htm">Application-Driven GQOS Components</a> category. Despite the fact that no quality of service requests would have been instigated to set the 802.1p bit without the application's invocation of a GQOS component, its explanation is best placed in a discussion of network-driven components. The ripple-effect of 802.1p bit setting, then, is felt greatest in the network.</p>
<p>
Although individual components from among the three categories can function independently at times to provide subsets of QOS functionality, GQOS overall is an integrated technology. </p>
<p>
The following figure provides a visual representation of the structure of GQOS documentation, and the reasoning behind its structure; certain GQOS components have greatest impact in one of the three categories, and are thus discussed there:</p>
