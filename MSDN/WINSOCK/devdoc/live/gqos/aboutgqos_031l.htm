<p>
The Traffic Control API (TCAPI), is a programmatic interface to the Traffic Control components that regulate network traffic on local hosts; both from an internal perspective (within the kernel itself), and from a network perspective (prioritization and cueing of packets based on transmission priority).</p>
<p>
Traffic Control is implicitly invoked through calls made to the GQOS API and subsequently serviced by the GQOS Service Provider (GQOS SP). However, applications that require further or specific control over Traffic Control can use the TCAPI. The GQOS SP also uses TCAPI calls.</p>
