<p>
IP Precedence allows packets passing through core network devices that operate on Layer 3 information, such as routers, to have their relative priority differentiated from one another. IP Precedence is established by the setting of specific bits in the IP header. With IP Precedence, Layer 3 devices can establish precedence-based cues and provide better service (when packet service is subject to cueing, as is the case under significant traffic loads) to packets that have higher priority.</p>
<p>
In order for IP Precedence to be effective, Layer 3 devices must be IP Precedence-enabled.</p>
