<p>
Most developers of GQOS-enabled applications will find their requirements met within the GQOS API, and the requisite knowledge of components will fall largely under the <a href="aboutgqos_08z7.htm">Application-Driven GQOS Components</a> section. Thus, reading through the Application-Driven GQOS Components overview material, combined with the API reference information in <a href="gqosfunc_4jdx.htm">GQOS Reference</a>, should provide nearly all of the information necessary to develop GQOS-aware applications.</p>
<p>
There is other information available within the other sections found within this GQOS documentation that facilitates the development of granular Traffic Control, such as that found in the <a href="aboutgqos_43qr.htm">Network-Driven GQOS Components</a> section, that can provide explanations of the underlying technologies and programmatic reference to interfaces available for such efforts. In such circumstances, a reading of the Application-Driven and Network-Driven sections is suggested.</p>
<p>
For development of policy components, such as third party authentication services intended to provide network resource admission services, the Policy-Driven sections are likely best candidates.</p>
<p>
For a complete understanding of GQOS and its components, as they are implemented and interact within the Windows NT® 5.0 (and Windows 98) framework, reading of all of the overview sections is recommended.</p>
