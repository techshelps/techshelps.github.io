<p>
The Local Policy Module (LPM) is a GQOS component responsible for retrieving and returning policy information used within the <a href="aboutgqos_3y5h.htm">Admission Control Service</a> (ACS). A default Windows NT LPM provides an interface to policy information that is configured and stored in the Windows NT 5.0 Active Directory. LPM is a generic term used to denote the implementation of a "courier service" used to provide the ACS with a means of retrieving policy information from a given policy store. LPMs will generally be implemented as a DLL.</p>
<p>
LPMs provided for an ACS server or service must have a corresponding component (a DLL) that resides on the client. LPMs are thus implemented on the end node and the ACS server; this is a necessary logical configuration, as end-node generated user information, carried by RSVP to the ACS (which then gets forwarded down to the LPM), must be provided in a format that the ACS's LPM is expecting and can process. </p>
<p>
It is important to note the difference between IETF draft technologies and Microsoft's implementation of such technologies. Subnet Bandwidth Manager (SBM), for example, is a technology begotten from an IETF draft proposal for regulating access to 802 subnets (IETF draft-yavatkar-sbm-ethernet-03.txt). ACS is a Windows NT 5.0 service (and a GQOS component) that incorporates SBM technology within its fold to incorporate regulation of access to 802 subnets in accordance with policy control. </p>
<p>
In the SBM IETF draft, the implementation and integration of policy regulation within the SBM technology is extensively discussed and outlined, but is necessarily unspecific; with ACS and the LPM(s) that couriers policy information from a centralized policy store (the Active Directory when using the GQOS PE component), the generalized IETF draft finds specific implementation within Windows NT 5.0.</p>
