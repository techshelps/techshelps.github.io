<h1><a name="_gqos_about_gqos"></a>About GQOS</h1>
<p>
<span style=color:#FF0000>[This is preliminary documentation and subject to change.]</span> </p>
<p>
GQOS is a collection of components that enable differentiation and preferential treatment for subsets of data transmitted over the network. GQOS is Microsoft's implementation of Quality of Service (QOS); Quality of Service is a defined term that loosely means subsets of data get higher priority or guaranteed "service" when traversing a network. </p>
<p>
GQOS technology has implications for the application programmer and the network administrator. By writing QOS enabled-applications, programmers can:
<ul>
<li>
Specify or request bandwidth requirements particular to their application, such as latency requirements for streaming audio.</li>
<li>
Write mission-critical applications for the corporate environment that are guaranteed to get their required bandwidth, provided permissions and bandwidth availability exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Just as importantly, network administrators can leverage knowledge of GQOS to achieve the following:
<ul>
<li>
Control network device resources based on user permissions and/or application usage.</li>
<li>
Reserve portions of a given bandwidth, whether an Ethernet subnet or a WAN interface, for applications or users that require such availability for core business activities.</li>
<li>
Shape and smooth the traffic that clients submit to the network, thereby avoiding the overburdening of switches and routers suffered with traditional bursty transmissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
GQOS achieves this through programmatic interfaces, the cooperation of multiple components, and communication with network devices throughout the end-to-end network solution.</p>
