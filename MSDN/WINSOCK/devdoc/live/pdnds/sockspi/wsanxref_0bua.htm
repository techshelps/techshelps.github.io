<p>
Editors Note: The Windows Sockets 2 wireless group is currently re-evaluating the planned definition of the NetDev device control API as a means to meet the requirements of wireless-aware applications. Other alternatives such as Desktop Management Interface (DMI) are under active consideration. The material which appeared here in the previous edition of this Annex has been elided until such time as these discussions produce a clear direction.</p>
<p>
This section covers extensions to Windows Sockets 2 that are specific to the use of wireless networks. It also describes aspects of base Windows Sockets 2 functions that require special consideration or which may exhibit unique behavior when using such networks. </p>
