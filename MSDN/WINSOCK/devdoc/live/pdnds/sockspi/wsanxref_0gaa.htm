<h1><a name="_win32_windows_sockets_and_tapi_integration_2"></a>Windows Sockets and TAPI Integration</h1>
<p>
Editors Note: After extensive consultations between experts on both Windows Sockets and TAPI, a general consensus has emerged that networking applications can best meet their telephony needs by utilizing the Remote Network Access (also known as Remote Access Services) facilities of Windows ™ instead of directly accessing the Windows Telephony API (TAPI). Therefore, the material which appeared here in previous versions of the Annex has been elided.</p>
<p>
This section describes mechanisms for using the Windows Sockets interface in conjunction with the TAPI. It was prepared by the Windows Sockets Forum's Connection Oriented Media functionality group. </p>
