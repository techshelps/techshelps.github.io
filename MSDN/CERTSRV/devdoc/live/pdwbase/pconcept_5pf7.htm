<h1><a name="_certsrv_supp_processing_certificate_requests"></a>Processing Certificate Requests</h1>
<p>
Microsoft® Certificate Server performs the following steps when processing a certificate request:
<ol>
<li>
<i>Request reception.</i> The certificate request is sent by the client to an intermediary application, which formats it into a PKCS #10 format request and submits it to the <a href="pconcept_9s9x.htm">Server Engine</a>.</li>
<li>
<i>Request approval.</i> The Server Engine calls the <a href="pconcept_349x.htm">Policy Module</a>, which queries request properties, decides whether the request is authorized or not, and sets optional certificate properties.</li>
<li>
<i>Certificate formation. </i>If the request is approved, the Server Engine takes the request, and any properties requested by the Policy Module, and builds a complete certificate.</li>
<li>
<i>Certificate publication. </i>The Server Engine stores the completed certificate in the certificate store and notifies the intermediary application of the request status. If the <a href="pconcept_14xf.htm">exit module</a> has so requested, the Server Engine will notify it of a certificate issuance event. This allows the exit module to perform further operations such as publishing the certificate to a directory service. Meanwhile, the intermediary gets the published certificate from the certificate store and passes it back to the client. </li>
</ol>
