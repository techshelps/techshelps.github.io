<p>
Microsoft® Certificate Server can be used to grant certificates to end-users within an organization so they can conduct secure communications across the Internet and gain access to the corporate intranet. Two examples:
<ol>
<li>
Branch offices. The Internet supplements or serves as a corporate WAN.</li>
<li>
Supplier/vendor relationships. Intranet access is granted to groups of users from key partners.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The Certificate Authority (CA) issuing the certificates can implement policies tailored to each specific case. An example of such a policy would include the following:
<ul>
<li>
Use authenticated RPC to receive certificate requests and transmit completed certificates.</li>
<li>
Check that the Issuer Organization and Issuer Organizational Unit information specified in certificate requests correctly identifies the CA server's organization (specified in the CA server's configuration file).</li>
<li>
Check that the Subject Common Name information specified in certificate requests matches the authenticated user name. </li>
</ul>
