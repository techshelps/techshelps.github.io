<h2><a name="_certsrv_server_database"></a>Server Database</h2>
<p>
Certificate Server includes a Server Database that maintains status information and a log of all issued certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs). The database is composed of two parts, the Server Log and the Server Queue.</p>
<p>
The Server Log stores all certificates and CRLs issued by the server so administrators can track, audit and archive server activity. In addition, the Server Log is used by the <a href="pconcept_9s9x.htm">Server Engine</a> to store pending revocations prior to publishing them in the CRL. The Server Log also stores recent certificate requests for a configurable period of time in case a problem is encountered when issuing a certificate (for example, a delivery failure). The Certificate Log Utility provides administrative access to this part of the Certificate Server database.</p>
<p>
The Server Queue maintains status information (receipt, parsing, authorization, signing, dispatch) as a certificate request is being processed by the server. The Certificate Queue Utility provides administrative access to this part of the Certificate Server database.</p>
