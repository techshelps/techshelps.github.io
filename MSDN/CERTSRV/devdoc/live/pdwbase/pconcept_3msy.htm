<h1><a name="_certsrv_introducing_certificate_server"></a>Introducing Certificate Server</h1>
<p>
Microsoft® Certificate Server provides customizable services for issuing and managing certificates used in software security systems employing public-key cryptography. Certificate Server performs a central role in the management of software security systems to enable secure communications across the Internet, corporate intranets, and other nonsecure networks.</p>
<p>
Certificate Server receives requests for new certificates over transports such as RPC, HTTP, or e-mail. It checks each request against custom or site-specific policies, sets optional properties for the certificate to be issued, and issues the certificate. Certificate Server allows administrators to add elements to a certificate revocation list (CRL), and publish a signed CRL on a regular basis. Programmable interfaces are included for developers to create support for additional transports, policies, and certificate properties and formats.</p>
<p>
Certificate Server generates certificates in standard X.509 format. Certificates in X.509 format are commonly used to authenticate servers and clients performing secure communications using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. </p>
