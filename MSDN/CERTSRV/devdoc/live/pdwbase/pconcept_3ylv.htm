<p>
The following examples show situations where Microsoft® Certificate Server typically grants certificates to users within an organization so they can conduct secure communications across the Internet and gain access to the corporate intranet. 
<ul>
<li>
Branch offices where the Internet supplements or serves as a corporate WAN.</li>
<li>
Supplier or vendor relationship where intranet access is granted to groups of users from key partners.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Certificate Authority (CA) issuing the certificates can implement policies tailored to each specific case. An example of such a policy would include the following:
<ul>
<li>
Use authenticated RPC to receive certificate requests and transmit completed certificates.</li>
<li>
Check that the Issuer Organization and Issuer Organizational Unit information specified in certificate requests correctly identifies the CA server organization (specified in the CA server configuration file).</li>
<li>
Check that the Subject Common Name information specified in certificate requests matches the authenticated user name.</li>
</ul>
