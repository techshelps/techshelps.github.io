<H2>    Conclusion: Know Your Framework</H2><P>If you've followed the general migration discussion in the first Phase of this migration guide, and perhaps tried out some of the additional migration techniques in the second and third Phases, you have an MFC application whose heart is essentially still the original code you wrote in C. But now the application is in C++, and because it's an MFC application, it's poised for easier future development and future migrations, such as from 16 bit to 32 bit.</P>
<P>At this point, you may still find the MFC application framework somewhat mysterious. This migration guide concludes with a few tips about how to improve your understanding and take advantage of MFC's tremendous flexibility.</P>
