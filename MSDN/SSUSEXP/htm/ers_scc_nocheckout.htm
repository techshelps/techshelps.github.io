<h1><a name="ers_scc_nocheckout"></a>No files are available to be checked out from source control.</h1>
<p>
This error has the following cause and solution:
<ul>
<li>
There are no unchecked-out files in the current VSS project.<p>
To check out a file not yet added to source control, use the Add Files command to add files.  If the file is already in your project, make sure it is not already checked out.</P><BR><p>
This error sometimes occurs if someone deletes the file that you wanted to operate on (or deletes the whole project, for that matter)- make sure your project is still there.  </P><BR></li>
