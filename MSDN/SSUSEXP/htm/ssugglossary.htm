Levels of permission users are granted by the VSS administrator to use the VSS database.&nbsp; The levels of access rights are Read,<b> </b>Check Out, Add, and Destroy.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_advanceddialogbox"></a><b>Advanced dialog box</b></p>
<p>
Dialog box that contains optional or additional settings.&nbsp; Many VSS dialog boxes have an Advanced button that displays additional settings.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_automaticmerge"></a><b>automatic merge</b></p>
<p>
When multiple users have the same file checked out, their changes to the file are merged by VSS during check in.</p>

<p>
<a name="b"></a><b>B</b></p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_branchedfile"></a><b>branched file</b></p>
<p>
File whose share link has been broken using the <b>Branch</b> command.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_branching"></a><b>branching</b></p>
<p>
Process of sharing a file with another project and then separating it into two or more branches.&nbsp; Once a branch has been created, two files (the file in the project, and its counterpart in other projects) will have a shared history up to a certain point, and divergent histories after that time.</p>

<p>
<a name="c"></a><b>C</b></p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_checkedinfile"></a><b>checked-in file</b></p>
<p>
File stored in the VSS database and unavailable for modification.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_checkedoutfile"></a><b>checked-out file</b></p>
<p>
File that has been reserved for work by a user.&nbsp; Users check out files to make changes to them.&nbsp; In the default configuration, VSS allows only one user at a time to check out a file.&nbsp; Checking out a file copies its latest version into the user's working folder.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_checkoutfolder"></a><b>check-out folder</b></p>
<p>
Folder to which a file is checked out in VSS.&nbsp; It is not the working folder.&nbsp; If you check out a file, the file is checked out to your working folder.&nbsp; To another user, the file is in the check-out folder.&nbsp; The check-out folder is displayed in the Check Out Folder column of the file pane; the working folder is displayed under the toolbar.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_cloaking"></a><b>cloaking</b></p>
<p>
Preventing a project from being affected by certain commands, for example, <b>Get Latest Version</b>, <b>Check Out</b>, <b>Check In</b>, <b>Undo Check Out</b>, and <b>Project Show Difference</b>.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_columnarformatting"></a><b>column format</b></p>
<p>
Formatting option used with keyword expansion within a file.&nbsp; This option (using two colons instead of one in the keyword instructions) tells VSS to align columns of keyword information for a more readable display.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_conflict"></a><b>conflict</b></p>
<p>
Two or more different changes to the same line of code in a multiple check out situation.&nbsp; VSS recognizes conflicts during a merge operation, and flags them in some way.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_conflictmarker"></a><b>conflict marker</b></p>
<p>
Symbol used to designate conflicting changes to a file.&nbsp; These symbols are:</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows width=587>
<tr valign=top>
<td class=label width=50%><b>Symbol</b></td>
<td class=label width=50%><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=50%>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</td>
<td width=50%>SourceSafe version</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=50%>======</td>
<td width=50%>Conflict separator</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=50%>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</td>
<td width=50%>Local version</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
<p>
VSS places these marks in the file after a conflicting check-in or merge operation, so conflicts can be easily found and resolved.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_keywordenabledfile"></a><b>keyword-enabled file</b></p>
<p>
File that contains VSS keyword information. </p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_keywordexpansion"></a><b>keyword expansion</b></p>
<p>
Process VSS uses to replace a VSS keyword with meaningful header information when you use the <b>Check In</b> and <b>Add Files</b> commands.&nbsp; For example, the string <code>"$Revision:&nbsp;&nbsp; $"</code> tells VSS to expand the <b>Revision</b> keyword automatically with the current file version number.</p>

<p>
<a name="l"></a><b>L</b></p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_label"></a><b>label</b></p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_locking"></a><b>locking</b></p>
<p>
System of ensuring that two processes do not affect the same record in a database at the same time.&nbsp; To coordinate record access, VSS applies native locking, which uses native operating system functions.&nbsp; VSS also can be set to use lockfiles, which create temporary files in the LOCKS folder.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_merging"></a><b>merging</b></p>
<p>
Process of combining differences in two or more changed copies of a file into a new version of the file.&nbsp; A merge involves at least two different files (which can be different versions of the same file or changes made to the same version of the file) and creates a new file made up of the results of the merge.&nbsp; Merging can occur when the user merges two branches or when the <b>Check In</b> or <b>Get Latest Version</b> command is used.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_multiplecheckout"></a><b>multiple check out</b></p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_password"></a><b>password</b></p>

Text string used as security to verify the identity of a user.&nbsp; A user password is often required to use the VSS database.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_project"></a><b>project</b></p>
<p>
Group of related files, typically all the files required to develop a software component.&nbsp; Files can be grouped within a project to create subprojects.&nbsp; Projects can be defined in any way meaningful to the user(s).

<p>
<a name="gloss_proj_sec_sys"></a><b>project security system</b></p>
<p>
The more restrictive of the two security systems provided by VSS.&nbsp; By default, it is disabled.&nbsp; When enabled by the admin, this feature allows an admin to set access rights on a per user, per project basis.&nbsp; See <a href="#gloss_accessrights">Access Rights</a>.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_recursiveoperation"></a><b>recursive operation</b></p>
<p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_resultspane"></a><b>Results pane</b></p>
<p>
Portion of the VSS Explorer window where results from VSS operations are shown.&nbsp; For example, when you check in a file, this pane shows the file name being checked in.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_reversedelta"></a><b>reverse delta</b></p>
<p>
Change-storage technology used by VSS, in which incremental changes to a baseline file are stored, rather than each successive version of the file in its entirety.&nbsp; In VSS, the current version of a file is used as the baseline, and changes from the previous versions are saved.&nbsp; This results in reduced disk storage requirements and faster access times, because only the current version is stored in the database in its entirety.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_rightspropagation"></a><b>rights propagation</b></p>
<p>
Default assignment of user-access rights in subprojects based on rights assigned in the parent project.&nbsp; This default assignment can be changed.</p>

<a name="s"></a><b>S</b></p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_security"></a><b>security</b></p>
<p>
VSS has two levels of security: default security and project security.&nbsp; Default security provides two access rights: read/write and read-only.&nbsp; When project security is enabled, four access rights are available per user, per project: Read, Check Out, Add, and Destroy.&nbsp; Each succeeding right includes all rights preceding it.&nbsp; The Destroy access right provides unlimited access and is equivalent to Read/Write rights under default security.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_shadowfolder"></a><b>shadow folder</b></p>
<p>
Central, optional folder that contains current versions of all the files in a project.&nbsp; The shadow folder does not contain the master copy of a file or the local copy of a file.&nbsp; Instead, it provides a central location from which to view the overall structure of the project and serves as a convenient place to build or compile the project.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_sharelink"></a><b>share link</b></p>
<p>
Link between a file shared with one or more projects.&nbsp; This link serves to update the shared file with any checked-in changes, regardless of which project the file was checked out from.</p>

<p>
File simultaneously used by, and part of, more than one project.</p>

<p>
<a name="gloss_sourcecodecontrol"></a><b>source code control</b></p>
