<p>
When a file is shared among multiple projects, a file in one project is linked to all other projects that share it. Therefore, when you check out the file from one project, it is also checked out from all the projects that share it. </p>
<p>
This warning has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
You checked out a file from one project, and are attempting to check the file in or undo the check out from another project that shares the same file. <p class=tl>
This is a valid action. VSS is simply alerting you in case this is not what you intend. </P><p class=tl>
To proceed, click <b>Yes</b>.</P><p class=tl>
To cancel the operation, click <b>No</b>.</P></li>
</ul>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></B>You can check in a file or undo a check out from any project that shares a file.</p>
