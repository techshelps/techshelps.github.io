<h1><a name="ers_str_update_path"></a>&lt;File&gt; was checked out from &lt;Local Folder&gt;, not from the current folder. Continue anyway? (Y/N)</h1>
<p>
This warning has the following cause and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
When a file is checked out, VSS records where the file was copied to.&nbsp; When a file is checked in from the command line, VSS, by default, looks in the current folder for the file.&nbsp; If a copy of the file exists in the current folder, but that not in the location the file was checked out to this message will appear.<p class=tl>
Type <b>Y</b> if you want to check in the file that exists in the current folder.</P><p class=tl>
Type <b>N</b> if you want to abort the operation and not check in the local folder.&nbsp; If you want to check in a file that doesn’t exist in the current folder, use the –GL switch of the checkout command to tell VSS what folder to check in the file from.</P></li>
