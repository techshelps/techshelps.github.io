<h1><a name="ers_vb_scc_nomap"></a>The file &lt;filename&gt; could not be mapped to the source code control provider project &lt;project&gt;.</h1>
<p>
This error has the following cause and solution:
<ul>
<li>
The source code control provider does not know which source code control provider project to place the file into, or get the file from.  <p>
The source code control provider determines this based on which folder the file is in.  Though the source code control provider can map projects to directories within a project/folder subfolder, files in subdirectories or on other drives create problems, unless there already is an association between the folder that the file is coming from and a source code control provider project.</P><BR><p>
Add the specified file to a folder at the same level as, or under, the specified project.  If the file is already in the source code control provider, share the file to the current project.</P><BR></li>
