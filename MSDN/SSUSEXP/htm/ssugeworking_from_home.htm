<h1><a name="ssugeworking_from_home"></a>Working from Home (Using RAS)</h1>
<p>
VSS 6.0 has been improved for using a RAS connection, however, file transfer over a modem is typically slow.&nbsp; Here are some tips to speed things up:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
If you are taking files home on a portable disk, copy the vssver.scc file and all the source files into the same directory.&nbsp; The vssver.scc file helps VSS determine if the latest version is being used, which will minimize network traffic over the phone line.&nbsp; If you use this tip, you must copy <b>all</b> files to your home machine or VSS may think you have newer versions of files than you do, and fail to do a get for some files.<br><br></li>
<li>
Doing a get over RAS when many files have changed is inherently a slow operation, even after VSS 6.0 performance enhancements.&nbsp; For the best results, perform a get to a portable disk before you leave work, and only do check in and check out's from home.&nbsp; Get files over RAS only when you really need to, to save yourself time.&nbsp; (For example, if you check out the latest version of a file using RAS, the check out operation may copy a file that needs other new files to compile.&nbsp; At this point, you'd have to do a get of the entire project, extremely time-consuming.)<br><br></li>
<li>
To avoid doing gets over RAS, you can check out old versions of a file from the VSS History dialog box (via <b>Tools</b>, <b>Show History</b>) or from the command line.&nbsp; Multiple checkouts must be enabled to use this feature.&nbsp; See your VSS Administrator to enable multiple checkouts.<br><br></li>
<li>
The command line is usually faster to use from home than the GUI.</li>
</ul>
<p class=label>
<b>Here are some ways to configure VSS to run faster over RAS:</b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Configure VSS to use a local temp directory.<br><br></li>
<li>
Configure VSS to compare files by Checksum instead of contents (Checksum is the default).<br><br></li>
<li>
Do not use the keyword expansion feature.<br><br></li>
<li>
Change the users.txt file to configure VSS to use a local ss.ini file, as follows: </li>
</ul>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note</b></B> &nbsp; Make sure you've done a backup first!</p>
<p class=tl>
Change:USER_NAME=\USERS\USER_NAME\SS.INI</P><p class=tl>
to:USER_NAME=&lt;local drive&gt;\SS\USER\SS.INI</P><p class=tl>
</P><p class=label>
<b>If you work from home often, you may also want to ask your VSS Administrator to configure VSS for faster access over RAS by doing any of the following:</b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Turn off shadow directories.<br><br></li>
<li>
Turn off the journal file.<br><br></li>
<li>
Turn off project security.</li>
</ul>
