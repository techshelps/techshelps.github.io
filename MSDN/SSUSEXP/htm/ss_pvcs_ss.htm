PVCS_SS.exe converts a PVCS project or file into a VSS <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_project">project</a> or file.</p>
<p>
VSS and PVCS use different internal file storage methods, so PVCS users cannot simply switch to using VSS; they must first extract all PVCS log files and enter them into VSS projects.</p>
<p>
You can convert a project manually by getting a PVCS file and then adding it to VSS.&nbsp; However, there are disadvantages: It takes a lot of time and is error pron since it does not retain file histories and comments; only the latest version of each file is converted.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
PVCS_SS.exe provides an automatic solution.&nbsp; It converts PVCS log files into VSS files, with histories and comments intact.</p>
<p class=indent>
<b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Only the VSS <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_vssadministrator">administrator</a> can run PVCS_SS.exe.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>Preparing to run PVCS_SS.exe:</b>
<ol>
<li>
Back up your PVCS project files and <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_vssdatabase">VSS database</a>.<br><br></li>
<li>
Make sure both PVCS and VSS are fully installed on your system.&nbsp; PVCS_SS.exe does not replace the installation process for VSS; it is run after VSS installation.<br><br></li>
<li>
<a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_logon">Log on</a> to VSS as the Admin user.&nbsp; The best way to do this is by setting environment (operating system) variables at the command prompt.&nbsp; SSUSER and SSPWD are environment variables that indicate your username and password, respectively.&nbsp; For example:<pre><code>Set ssuser = admin
Set sspwd = hoof
</code></pre>
<p class=tl>
By default, the VSS administrator is not assigned a password; specify a password only if you have assigned Admin a password.</P></li>
<li>
Make sure that the PVCS folder (where executable files such as Get.exe and VLog.exe are located), and the VSS folder, are both on your MS-DOS path.&nbsp; While adding these folders to the path is not required, it makes running PVCS_SS.exe easier.</li>
</ol>
<p>
You are now ready to run the PVCS_SS.exe and convert all your files.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>To run PVCS_SS.exe:</b>
<ol>
<li>
Change to the folder where the PVCS log files are located.<p class=tl>
PVCS log files store all your data, comments, histories, and so on.&nbsp; In general, they are named with the extensions that your filenames use, terminated with a V, so that Test.C becomes Test.C_V, and Test.pas becomes Test.pav.&nbsp; However, the PVCS configuration setting LOGSUFFIX can change the log file extension name.</P></li>
<li>
Type <b>PVCS_SS</b> <i>&lt;PVCS logfiles&gt; &lt;VSS project&gt;</i><p class=tl>
The destination VSS project name must start with a dollar sign ($).&nbsp; Otherwise, this variable is assumed to be a PVCS log file.&nbsp; A few examples are given below.</P><pre><code>PVCS_SS *.??V $/Project
PVCS_SS TEST.C_V TEST.H_V $/Test
PVCS_SS *.PAV TEST.TXV $/
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all PVCS log files you want to convert.</li>
</ol>
<p class=label>
<b>Remarks</b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The filename in VSS is not the name of the PVCS log file; it is the name of the PVCS work file, that is, the real name of the file.&nbsp; For example, Test.C_V becomes Test.C in VSS.<br><br></li>
<li>
If the VSS project you specify exists, the converted files are added to it.&nbsp; If the project does not exist, it is created.&nbsp; If you do not specify a project, the current <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_currentproject">project</a> for the VSS Admin user is used.<br><br></li>
<li>
If a file has gone through ten revisions in PVCS, there are ten versions of the file in VSS.&nbsp; However, the numbering systems used by the two programs are different.&nbsp; PVCS starts off with 1.0, followed by 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and so forth.&nbsp; VSS uses whole numbers: 1, 2, 3, and so on.&nbsp; Therefore, what was 1.3 in PVCS becomes version 4.0 in VSS.<br><br></li>
<li>
While PVCS_SS.exe is running, it displays all files that it is converting and all branches that it is ignoring.&nbsp; This is logged in a file called PVCS_SS.log in the folder in which VSS is installed.<br><br></li>
<li>
A null revision in PVCS is a revision of a file that encodes no changes to the file contents.&nbsp; PVCS_SS.exe determines how to treat these revisions based on the <a href="ini_updatenochange.htm">Update_No_Change</a> initialization variable in the Admin user's SS.INI file.&nbsp; If the Update_No_Change variable is not set, PVCS_SS.exe assumes the default value, updates, and converts all null revisions.<br><br></li>
<li>
Both PVCS and VSS support <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_branching">Branches</a>, but PVCS_SS.exe does not convert PVCS branches to VSS branches.&nbsp; You must manually convert the branches you want to keep.&nbsp; PVCS_SS.exe assists with this process by reporting and logging in PVCS_SS.log all the branches that it passes over.</li>
