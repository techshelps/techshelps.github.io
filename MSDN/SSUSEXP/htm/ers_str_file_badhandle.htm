<ul type=disc>
<li>
VSS is trying to open a non-existent file, or a file to which the path is incorrect. VSS attempts to resolve file paths relative to the location of the SRCSAFE.INI file located in the server installation folder. </li>
</ul>
<p>
This error has the following possible causes and solution:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The Journal_File variable in the SRCSAFE.INI file is set to a location that is unavailable, such as a drive mapping that has been disconnected.<br><br></li>
<li>
You are attempting to show differences on a file whose working directory is a floppy drive, and there is no disk in the drive.<p class=tl>
In either case VSS must be able to locate the file it needs to complete the operation.</P></li>
