<p>
In this tab you can specify options for the types of files you store in VSS. </p>
<p class=label>
<b>To display the File Types tab:</b>
<ol>
<li>
On the <b>Tools</b> menu, click <b>Options</b>.<br><br></li>
<li>
Select the <b>File Types</b> tab.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Many of the VSS dialog boxes contain file lists that allow you to select multiple files for a specific operation. You can use this tab to filter these file lists so that they are more meaningful to the type of work you do. </p>
<p class=label>
<b>Tab Options</b></p>
<p>
You can specify/change all of the following options.</p>
<p>
<b>Binary Files</b></p>
<p>
Overrides VSS's automatic detection of text and binary files, so that you can indicate that certain file types are always binary. For example, you can enter *.obj, *.xls, *.frx in this box to specify that all object files, Microsoft Excel worksheets, and Visual Basic .frx files should always be treated as binary files.</p>
<p>
<b>Create SCC File</b></p>
<p>
This box is useful only for Visual Basic and Visual C++ users. When you work with a Visual Basic project in VSS, a special file is created in your working folder called Mssccprj.scc. This file can never be added to VSS: it stays in your working folder and stores important information used by the VSS integration in Visual Basic.</p>
<p>
<b>Create SCC File</b> dictates when VSS creates this file. Its default setting (*.vbp, *.mak) means that whenever you get or add a file with an extension of .vbp (Visual Basic 4.0 project file) or .mak (used by older versions of Visual Basic), VSS creates the Mssccprj.scc file. This file is very important because without it, VSS integration inside Visual Basic will not function properly.</p>
<p>
Visual C++ makes some of the SCC file. Add "*.dsp files" to this field to help Visual C++ easily locate VSS projects.</p>
<p>
<b>File Groups</b></p>
<p>
Together with the <b>File Types Included in File Group </b>option, this option allows you to group file types into logical groups, which are then displayed in the List Files of Type options in many VSS dialog boxes. For example, if you are a C++ developer, you may want to store .cpp, .h, .rc, and .bmp files in VSS. If you are a Visual Basic developer, on the other hand, you may want to store .vbp and .frm files instead. You can use this tab to restrict the file lists to display just these file types rather than all the files in a specific folder.</p>
<p>
<b>Add </b></p>
<p>
Click here to add a new group of file extensions to the list. In the <b>Add File Group</b> dialog box, type a name for the new file group you want to add, like "VC" or "VB."</p>
<p>
<b>Delete </b></p>
<p>
Click here to delete the currently selected group. </p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></B>The &lt;Relevant Masks&gt; file group is a unique case. It cannot be deleted, as it indicates which files you would typically place into a project. </p>
<p>
<b>File Types Included In File Group</b></p>
<p>
This option allows you to modify a specific file group, as it shows the list of file types (extensions) included in the selected file groups. To modify a file group, edit the contents of the file types included in groups shown in the File Groups box.</p>
