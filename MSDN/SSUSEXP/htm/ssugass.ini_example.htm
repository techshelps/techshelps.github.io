The following example shows a sample SS.INI file.</p>
<pre><code>; SS.INI
;
; This file contains all the variables that "customize" Visual SourceSafe
; to your particular needs. The SS.INI variables are documented in
; Online Help. Only a few of them are placed in this file by default.

; C programmers should remove the semicolon from the following line, to
; uncomment it. Other programmers REPLACE the line with different masks.
; Relevant_Masks = *.c, *.h, *., *.asm

; The following line prevents you from being asked for a check out
; comment.
Checkout_Comment = -

Project = $/Samples
Maximized (Win) = No
Sort_Order = Date
[$/Features]
[$/MyProject]
</code></pre>
<p>
If you are running a multi-platform VSS installation, you may be using one SS.INI file under several different operating systems. If so, you probably want certain variables to have different values on the different platforms. You can place an identifier in parentheses after the variable name, to indicate that the variable should apply only on the platform referred to by that identifier. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Use_ReadOnly (NT) = Yes
</code></pre>
<p>
This setting, as specified, applies only under Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows NT. The same SS.INI file might have other settings for other platforms or conditions. You can, for example, set initialization variables to distinguish between the command line (CL) and the Explorer (UI). For example:</p>
<pre><code>Force_Dir (UI) = No
Force_Dir (CL) = Yes
</code></pre>
<p>
If the preceding values are the only ones containing parenthetical expressions that are present in your SS.INI file, when you run the Explorer, Force_Dir is set to No, and when you invoke VSS from the command line it is set to Yes. If a Force_Dir line that contains (for example) your machine name or "NT" is present in the file, however, it takes precedence over both of the lines given in this example.</p>
<p>
Computer names are known to VSS as platform specifiers. Only 10 platform specifiers are allowed per user, or 10 total per SS.INI file.</p>
