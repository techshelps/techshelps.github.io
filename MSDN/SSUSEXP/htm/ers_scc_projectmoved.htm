<h1><a name="ers_scc_projectmoved"></a>This project was named '&lt;name&gt;' but has been moved, copied, or renamed.</h1>
<p>
This message has the following cause and solution:
<ul>
<li>
Once you place an Access database under source code control, you are not allowed to rename it or move it to a different directory, or to work with copies of it.  When you open a database under source code control which has been moved, renamed, or copied, this message will be displayed and all source code control functions will be disabled for this database.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Do not work with a copy of an Access database which is under source code control.  Use the Create Database from SCC command to make a new database in the desired location.  </p>
<p>
If the database has been moved, return it to its original location and reopen it.  Source code control functions will return to normal.  Likewise, if it has been renamed, restore its original name.</p>
