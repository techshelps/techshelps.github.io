<h1><a name="idd_cwlerrors"></a>Check Hyperlinks Results Dialog Box</h1>
<p>
This dialog is shown after VSS has scanned your Web files for broken hyperlinks.&nbsp; VSS differentiates between two kinds of hyperlinks: internal, and external.</p>
<p>
Internal links are within your Web site: that is, one file refers to another file in the same VSS project tree.&nbsp; VSS checks all internal links, and displays any potential problems.&nbsp; Problems are <i>not</i> determined by actually searching for files on your Web site; instead, VSS searches for files inside your project tree.&nbsp; For instance, suppose that the file $/My/Web/FU.ASP contains the line:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;A HREF=“ORDER.HTM”&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
VSS will make sure that $/My/Web/ORDER.HTM exists.&nbsp; If that file exists, the hyperlink is valid, and is not displayed.&nbsp; If the file does not exist, this hyperlink is listed as broken.</p>
<p>
External hyperlinks are jumps to sites on the World Wide Web that are not in your project tree.&nbsp; VSS will try to resolve the external hyperlinks in your web page.</p>
<p>
<b>Check Hyperlinks Results Windows</b></p>
<h4>File - Invalid Links - Ignored Links</h4>
<p>
Lists the file being checked, with a summary of the number of invalid links and the number of links ignored.</p>
<h4>Links which appear invalid in file</h4>
<p>
Lists the internal and external hyperlinks that VSS determined to be invalid.</p>
<h4>Links that were not checked in file</h4>
<p>
Lists the internal and external hyperlinks that were not checked.</p>
<p class=indent>
<B><b>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></B>Double clicking on an ignored link will launch Internet Explorer, which will attempt to resolve the link and display the results.</p>
