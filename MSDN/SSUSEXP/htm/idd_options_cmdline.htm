<h1><a name="idd_options_cmdline"></a>Command Line Options Tab</h1>
<p>
<img src="line.gif" border=0></p>
<p>
Controls options that affect VSS's command line.&nbsp; These options don't affect the behavior of VSS Explorer.</p>
<p class=label>
<b>To display the Command Line tab:</b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
On the <b>Tools</b> menu, click <b>Options</b>, and then click <b>Command-Line Options</b>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Access Rights</h4>
<p>
Any VSS user can use this tab.</p>
<p>
<b>Tab Options</b></p>
<p>
The first two options affect how VSS interacts with your working folder during command-line operations.&nbsp; By default in the Explorer, VSS expects a working folder to be set for each project, and will check out files to that folder only.&nbsp; By default on the command line, VSS assumes your current project and current folder are what you want to be working with, and ignores any working folders set for a specific project. To change current projects, you need to use the <b>CP</b> command.&nbsp; You can modify this behavior by checking one or the other of the following two options:</p>
<h4>Assume <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_workingfolder">Working Folder</a> Based On Current <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_currentproject">Project</a></h4>
<p>
Determines how the working folder you've set is used:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
If this option is selected, a file is put into your working folder for the project, even if that is not the current folder when you execute a command on a file from the command line.<br><br></li>
<li>
If this option is not selected, subprojects go into their own respective working folders instead of subfolders under the main folder.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Assume Project Based On Working Folder</h4>
<p>
Automatically sets the <a href="ssugglossary.htm#gloss_currentproject">current project</a>, based on the current folder. If set, VSS looks at your current folder whenever you execute any VSS command.&nbsp; If this is the working folder for a VSS project, VSS automatically changes to that project before executing the command.&nbsp; Hence, you can change folders to move around your projects, without ever executing the ss <b>CP</b> command. If you set this option, it is highly recommended that you do not give two projects the same working folder, because VSS won't know which project to switch into.</p>
<p>
If not set, VSS does not change to your current project when you execute any VSS command.</p>
<h4>No Comment On Check Out</h4>
<p>
Does not prompt for a comment on check out.</p>
<h4>Apply Same Comment To All Files</h4>
<p>
Prompts you for one comment only (up to 64 characters), which VSS applies to all files involved in that check out operation.</p>
<h4>Apply Different Comment To Each File</h4>
<p>
Prompts you for a separate comment for each file involved in the check out operation.</p>
<h4>Prompt For Comments On The Command Line</h4>
<p>
Asks for comments on the command line.</p>
<h4>Use Editor To Prompt For Comments</h4>
<p>
Lets you specify an editor with which to enter your command-line comments. Once you have selected this option, you can enter the path for the selected editor in the <b>Editor</b> box.&nbsp; You can browse your file system for this information using the <b>Browse</b> button. If you leave the <b>Prompt String</b> box blank, no prompt is displayed in your editor.</p>
<h4>Use prompt string</h4>
<p>
Specifies that a prompt string asking for a comment is inserted into your specified editor when it opens.&nbsp; Disabled when <b>Prompt</b> for comments on the command line is selected.&nbsp; The prompt string is not saved with your comment (you don't have to delete it), unless you change the string in your editor.</p>
