<p>
When you add a new user and set that user's rights for a particular project, you create an assignment in the VSS database. That assignment propagates down the project list until another assignment is reached.</p>
<p>
For example, you assign Add rights (RCA) to user Maria in $/, the root project. In the $/Samples project you give her no explicit assignment, so she automatically has the same rights (RCA) as in the parent project, $/. However, in $/Samples/BusinessObject, you set up a new assignment giving her read-only (R) rights.</p>
<p>
This action blocks the earlier assignment in $/Samples from propagating down the tree, so that she has read-only rights in $/Samples/BusinessObjects and any projects under it.</p>
<p>
In project $/NorWind, you give Maria no specific assignment, so her rights from the root project, $/, propagate down the project list to $/NorWind. Therefore, she has RCA rights in $/NorWind and in its subproject. </p>
<p>
Access rights always propagate down in this manner, so a user's rights in the root project ($/) form a set of default rights for that user. These default rights apply to all projects in which you do not explicitly set assignments.</p>
<p>
When you first add a user, that user is given rights in the root project based on the default rights that you've established on the <b>Project Security</b> tab. You can, if appropriate, change the user's rights to globally modify the user’s permission level.</p>
