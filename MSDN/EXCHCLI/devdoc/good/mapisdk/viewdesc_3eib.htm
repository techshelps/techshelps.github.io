<h2><a name="_mapi1book_current_views"></a>Current Views</h2>
<p>
Current — or unnamed — views are derived from named views but have been modified through the Microsoft Exchange viewer or the view design commands on the <b>View</b> menu. </p>
<p>
When a user modifies a view by dragging the column header, using the <b>View</b> menu commands or by other means, the view will no longer be the same as a named view. In order to retain this new view for later uses of the folder, the view is saved as the current view on the folder. These current views are used when a view is saved and recalled automatically at the time the user selects something else and then returns to the folder. Current views, especially useful for public folders, allow every user to have a custom view on the folder that is saved between uses of the folder.</p>
<p>
Each folder, whether private or public, retains a view message in the IPM.Microsoft.FolderDesign.NamedView hidden folder. Whenever a folder is accessed for the first time, a view is created in this folder with a property PR_VD_VIEW_FOLDER, which is a MAPI record key, linking it to the folder being used. This view will initially have a link pointing to the named view that is the current view, but, if the current view is modified, this view will contain the view descriptor used to render the view. If a current view doesn't exist, Microsoft Exchange will use the initial view. If an initial view is not defined, Microsoft Exchange will use the normal view.</p>
