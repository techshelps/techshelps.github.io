<p>
Many applications written for Microsoft Exchange are designed to manipulate views. An application may, for example, programmatically create views for its folder application, or an application may simply include functionality to read or modify existing view definitions. The following information provides developers with the information necessary to create, read, modify, and delete any of the views used by Microsoft Exchange.</p>
<p>
Successful implementation of code designed to manipulate views requires proficiency in the C language and a good understanding of the Win32 Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI). </p>
<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>
This information on the Microsoft Exchange Client View Descriptor Data Format applies only to the Microsoft Exchange client version 4.0. This is not a part of the MAPI specification. Other MAPI clients, as well as future versions of the Microsoft Exchange client, may not be compatible with the view descriptor functionality built according to the information supplied here. </p>
