<h2><a name="_mapi1book_folder_views"></a>Folder Views</h2>
<p>
Folder views are defined on a folder by folder basis. They are only accessible when the folder is the current folder and its messages are displayed in the right pane. Folder views are located in the View.Folder Views cascade menu. Folder views are stored as hidden messages in the folder and are accessible by anyone having read access to the folder. Users can only create views on public folders for which they have owner permissions. Users cannot create private views on public folders. </p>
