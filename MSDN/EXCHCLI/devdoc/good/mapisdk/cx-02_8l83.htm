<h3><a name="_mapi1book_message_events"></a>Message Events</h3>
<p>
The Microsoft Exchange client enables extensions to control various details of how a message is handled when certain events occur. This is done with the <a href="ref-c01k_9r8u.htm"><b>IExchExtMessageEvents : IUnknown</b></a> interface, which allows extensions to intercept message events: 
<ul>
<li>
Immediately before <b>OnRead</b> and immediately after <b>OnRead Complete</b>, a message's properties are read from the message store. For example, when an extension displays a message in a form.</li>
<li>
Immediately before <b>OnWrite</b> and immediately after <b>OnWriteComplete</b> a message's properties are written to the message store.</li>
<li>
Immediately before and immediately after Microsoft Exchange resolves unresolved addresses. For example, when a user chooses the <b>Check Names</b> button.</li>
<li>
Immediately before and immediately after Microsoft Exchange submits an open message for delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, an extension might want to check spelling or validate data before it is written to the properties of the message in the store and sent to another user.</p>
<p>
Each one of the events in the preceeding list is associated with a method that is a member of <b>IExchExtMessageEvents</b>. For example, the <b>IExchExtMessageEvents::OnWrite</b> method is invoked whenever Microsoft Exchange is about to save the message properties.</p>
