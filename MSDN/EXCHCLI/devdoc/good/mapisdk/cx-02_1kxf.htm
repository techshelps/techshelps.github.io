<p>
You can create extensions that use either modal or modeless windows. When a modal window is displayed, users can only interact with the extension and not with Microsoft Exchange. For example, an extension might display a modal <b>Folder Backup</b> dialog box that enables a user to choose a specific folder to back up.</p>
<p>
In contrast, some extensions can run modelessly, displaying windows that allow the user to switch their input back and forth between Microsoft Exchange windows and the extension's windows. For example, a Stock Quote extension could display a modeless window that displays dynamically changing stock data while the user interacts with Microsoft Exchange windows.</p>
<p>
For simplicity, an extension that displays only modal windows is referred to as a modal extension while an extension that displays at least one modeless window is referred to as a modeless extension. </p>
<p>
Some extensions can involve a combination of modeless and modal windows; that is, modeless extensions might display modal windows at certain times. For example, the Stock Quote extension mentioned previously might display a modal <b>Options</b> dialog box.</p>
<p>
When writing modeless extensions, it is important to coordinate the actions of your extension's windows with the windows of Microsoft Exchange. For example, if Microsoft Exchange displays a modal window, modeless extensions should disable their windows. Interfaces that enable this cooperation are implemented by Microsoft Exchange and extensions. </p>
