<h2><a name="_mapi1book_using_folder_and_message_links"></a>Using Folder and Message Links</h2>
<p>
Links are most useful when you have a shared message store, such as the Microsoft® Exchange Server public folders, Lotus Notes, or the Microsoft Mail Server shared folders. One common use of links is to inform people, through the use of e-mail, of the presence of a new shared folder or message. Other people will not generally be able to follow links to your own personal messages or folders. (Links within a personal folder store may still be very useful, for instance, if you are compiling information for distribution and wish to cross-link items.)</p>
<p>
The Microsoft Exchange Client can both create and read folder links (.XNK files). To create a folder link in the filesystem, select the folder in the scope (left) pane of the Microsoft Exchange viewer, choose <b>Create Shortcut</b> from the <b>File</b> menu, and enter the path of the file you want. To open a Microsoft Exchange viewer on the folder named in the link, use the /t command line option. On Windows NT or Windows 95,</p>
<pre><code>exchng32 /t foo.xnk
 </code></pre>
<p>
and on Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups,</p>
<pre><code>exchng /t foo.xnk
 </code></pre>
<p>
This command always creates a new viewer window; if Microsoft Exchange is already running, it does not replace the folder currently being viewed with the linked folder.</p>
<p>
Folder links can also be attached to messages as ordinary attached files. Double-clicking on an attached folder link also causes Microsoft Exchange to open a new window for viewing the linked folder.</p>
<p>
The Microsoft Exchange Client can create and read message links in other messages. To create a message link in another message, choose the <b>Message</b> command from the <b>Insert</b> menu. In the Insert as radio button group of the resulting dialog box, select Link attachment to original item, then choose a message from the listbox. To activate a linked message, simply double-click it; Microsoft Exchange displays the message in a new window, using the appropriate form.</p>
