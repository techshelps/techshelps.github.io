<h3><a name="_mapi1book_session_events"></a>Session Events</h3>
<p>
When a new message arrives in a user's Inbox, a session event is sent to Microsoft Exchange. Extensions can be notified when a new message arrives by installing themselves in the EECONTEXT_SESSION context and by implementing the <a href="ref-c01k_25ny.htm"><b>IExchExtSessionEvents : IUnknown</b></a> interface, which supports only one method: <a href="ref-c01k_2u49.htm"><b>IExchExtSessionEvents::OnDelivery</b></a>. Whenever a session event occurs, Microsoft Exchange calls this method on all extensions that are registered to handle these events.</p>
<p>
<b>OnDelivery</b> passes a pointer to the <a href="ref-c01k_62lq.htm"><b>IExchExtCallBack : IUnknown</b></a> interface to the extension, which uses the pointer to obtain details about the current context. The extension returns S_OK from <b>OnDelivery</b> if it will handle the event. For example, an extension might use the <b>IExchExtCallBack</b> pointer to determine the class of the newly arrived message. If the message class is of a specific type, the extension might want to perform a custom operation on that message, such as extracting its properties and storing them in a database. </p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>  <b>IExchExtSessionEvents::OnDelivery</b> is called after the Microsoft Exchange Server has processed the rules attached to the folder. Therefore, <b>OnDelivery</b> will not be called if it was previously handled; for example, if a rule deleted the message. Because this is a server process, rules processing is performed prior to all extensions.</p>
