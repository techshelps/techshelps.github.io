<H2>WITH OWNERACCESS OPTION Declaration</H2>Description</P>
In a multiuser environment with a secure workgroup, use this declaration with a query to give the user who runs the query the same permissions as the query's owner.</P>
Syntax</P>
<I>sqlstatement</I> <I><BR>    </I>WITH OWNERACCESS OPTION</P>
Remarks</P>
The WITH OWNERACCESS OPTION declaration is optional.</P>
The following example enables the user to view salary information (even if the user doesn't otherwise have permission to view the Payroll table), provided that the query's owner does have that permission:</P>
<BR></P>
<PRE>SELECT LastName,FirstName, Salary<BR>FROM Employees<BR>ORDER BY LastName<BR>WITH OWNERACCESS OPTION;
</PRE>
If a user is otherwise prevented from creating or adding to a table, you can use WITH OWNERACCESS OPTION to enable the user to run a make-table or append query.</P>
If you want to enforce workgroup security settings and users' permissions, don't include the WITH OWNERACCESS OPTION declaration.</P>
This option requires you to have access to the System.mda file associated with the database. It's really useful only in secured multiuser implementations.</P>
See Also</P>
SELECT Statement.</P>
Specifics (Microsoft Access)</P>
You can include the WITH OWNERACCESS OPTION declaration in an SQL statement to allow users to run a query and view the results even if they don't have security permissions on the underlying tables. When this option is set, a user is granted the same permissions as the owner of the query.</P>
For example, the owner of a query on an Employees table can include the WITH OWNERACCESS OPTION declaration in the definition of the query that returns all fields except those that give employees' addresses. A user who does not have read permissions on the Employees table can then run the query and view only those fields included in the query. Effectively, the user now has restricted read access to the table.</P>
Using this declaration is equivalent to setting the <B>RunPermissions</B> property to Owner's in the query property sheet in query Design view. Omitting the declaration is equivalent to setting the <B>RunPermissions</B> property to User's, which is the default setting.</P></BODY>
