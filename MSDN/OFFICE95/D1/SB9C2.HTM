<H2>Idle Method</H2>Applies To</P>
<B>DBEngine </B>Object.</P>
Description</P>
Suspends data processing, enabling the Microsoft Jet database engine to complete any pending tasks such as memory optimization or page timeouts.</P>
Syntax</P>
<B>DBEngine.Idle [dbFreeLocks]</B></P>
Remarks</P>
You use the <B>Idle</B> method to provide the Jet database engine with the opportunity to perform background tasks that may not be up-to-date because of intense data processing. This is often true in multiuser, multitasking environments in which there isn't enough background processing time to keep all records in a recordset current.</P>
Usually, read locks are removed and data in local dynaset-type <B>Recordset</B> objects is updated only when no other actions (including mouse movements) are occurring. If you periodically use the <B>Idle</B> method, you provide the database engine with time to catch up on background processing tasks by releasing unneeded read locks. If you specify the <B>dbFreeLocks</B> constant as an argument, processing is delayed until all read locks are released.</P>
This method isn't needed in single-user environments unless multiple instances of an application are running. The <B>Idle</B> method may increase performance in a multiuser environment because it forces the database engine to flush data to disk, releasing locks on memory.</P>
You can also release read locks by making operations part of a transaction. For example:</P>
<BR></P>
<PRE>wspSession.BeginTrans
Set rstEmployees = rstEmployees.OpenRecordset("Employees")
wspSession.CommitTrans</PRE>
<P></P>
<BR></P>
<PRE>Do Until rstEmployees.EOF
    ...
    ...
    ...
    rstEmployees.MoveNext
Loop
