<H2>KeepLocal Property</H2>Applies To</P>
<B>QueryDef </B>Object,<B> TableDef </B>Object.</P>
Description</P>
Sets or returns a value on a <B>TableDef</B> or <B>QueryDef</B> object, or a table, query, form, report, macro, or module that you do not want made replicable when the database is converted to a replicable form.</P>
Setting and Return Value</P>
You set this property to the text string "T" to keep the object local while all other objects are made replicable when the database is made replicable. The <B>KeepLocal</B> property cannot be applied to objects after they have been converted into a replicable form.</P>
Remarks</P>
Local objects remain at the replica where they were created and are not propagated around the replica set. Each time you make a new replica in the set, all the replicable objects at the source replica are included in that new replica, but none of the local objects are included.</P>
The object on which you are setting the <B>KeepLocal</B> property might have already inherited that property from another object. However, the value set by the other object has no affect on the behavior of the object you want to <B>KeepLocal</B>. You must directly set the property for each object.</P>
