<H2>AbsolutePosition Property</H2>Applies To</P>
Dynaset-Type<B> Recordset </B>Object,<B> Recordset </B>Object, Snapshot-Type<B> Recordset </B>Object.</P>
Description</P>
Sets or returns the relative record number of a <B>Recordset</B> object's current record.</P>
Settings and Return Values</P>
The setting or return value is an integer from 0 to one less than the number of records in the <B>Recordset</B> object. It corresponds to the ordinal position of the current record in the <B>Recordset</B> object specified by the object. The data type is <B>Long</B>.</P>
Remarks</P>
The <B>AbsolutePosition</B> property enables you to position the current record pointer to a specific record based on its ordinal position in a dynaset- or snapshot-type <B>Recordset</B> object. You can also determine the current record number by checking the <B>AbsolutePosition</B> property setting.</P>
Because the <B>AbsolutePosition</B> property value is zero-based (that is, a setting of 0 refers to the first record in the <B>Recordset</B> object), it cannot be set to a value greater than or equal to the number of populated records; doing so causes a trappable error. You can determine the number of populated records in the <B>Recordset</B> object by checking the <B>RecordCount</B> property setting. The maximum allowable setting for the <B>AbsolutePosition</B> property is the value of the <B>RecordCount</B> property minus 1.</P>
If there is no current record, as when there are no records in the <B>Recordset</B> object, –1 is returned. If the current record is deleted, the <B>AbsolutePosition</B> property value isn't defined, and a trappable error occurs if it's referenced. New records are added to the end of the sequence.</P>
This property isn't intended to be used as a surrogate record number. Bookmarks are still the recommended way of retaining and returning to a given position and are the only way to position the current record across all types of <B>Recordset</B> objects. In particular, the position of a given record changes when one or more records preceding it are deleted. There is also no assurance that a given record will have the same absolute position if the <B>Recordset</B> object is re-created again because the order of individual records within a <B>Recordset</B> object isn't guaranteed unless it's created with an SQL statement using an ORDER BY clause.</P>
<P></P>
Note</P>
The <B>AbsolutePosition</B> property isn't available on a forward-only scrolling snapshot type <B>Recordset</B> object, or on a <B>Recordset</B> object opened from a pass-through query against a remote database.</P>

Example</P>
This example positions the current record to the nth record in a dynaset-type<B> </B><B>Recordset</B> object.</P>

<PRE>Function MoveToRecord (intPosition As Long, rstTest As recordset) _<BR>    As Integer

Example (Microsoft Access)</P>
The following example uses the <B>AbsolutePosition</B> property to set the ordinal position of the first record in a dynaset-type <B>Recordset</B> object to 1.</P>
<BR></P>
<PRE>Sub FirstRecord()
    Dim dbs As Database, rst As Recordset

    ' Return Database variable that points to current database.
    Set dbs = CurrentDb
    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE " &amp; _
        "[ShippedDate] &gt;= #1-1-95#;")
    rst.MoveFirst
    rst.AbsolutePosition = 1
End Sub
</PRE>
Example (Microsoft Excel)</P>
This example prompts the user for a record number. The example uses this number to move to a record in the Customer recordset in the NWINDEX.MDB database, and then it copies the values for three specified fields onto Sheet1.</P>
To create the NWINDEX.MDB database, run the Microsoft Excel example for the <B>CreateDatabase </B>method.</P>
<BR></P>
<PRE>Dim db As Database, rs As Recordset
Sheets("Sheet1").Activate
recordNumber = Application.InputBox(Prompt:="Record number to copy " _
    &amp; "to Sheet1", Title:="Record to copy", Type:=1)
If recordNumber = False Then    ' user cancelled InputBox
    Exit Sub
End If
Set db = Workspaces(0).OpenDatabase(Application.Path &amp; "\NWINDEX.MDB")
Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("Customer", dbOpenSnapshot)
rs.MoveLast
If rs.RecordCount &gt; recordNumber Then
    rs.AbsolutePosition = recordNumber
    ActiveCell.Value = rs.Fields("CONTACT").Value
    ActiveCell.Offset(, 1).Value = rs.Fields("ADDRESS").Value
    ActiveCell.Offset(, 2).Value = rs.Fields("CITY").Value</PRE>
<P></P>
<BR></P>
<PRE>Else
    MsgBox "The record #" &amp; recordNumber &amp; " doesn't exist."
End If
rs.Close
db.Close
