<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2"><P CLASS="t">(Default) In forms, two or more users can edit the same record simultaneously. This is also called “optimistic” locking. If two users attempt to save changes to the same record, Microsoft Access displays a message to the user who tries to save the record second. This user can then discard the record, copy the record to the Clipboard, or replace the changes made by the other user. This setting is typically used on read-only forms or in single-user databases. It is also used in multiuser databases to permit more than one user to be able to make changes to the same record at the same time.</P>

<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><P>You can set this property using the objects property sheet, a macro, or Visual Basic.</P>
<H2><A NAME="sec19"></A>Remarks</H2><P>You can use the No Locks setting for forms if only one person uses the underlying tables or queries or makes all the changes to the data.</P>
<P>In a multiuser database, you can use the No Locks setting if you want to use optimistic locking and warn users attempting to edit the same record on a form. You can use the Edited Record setting if you want to prevent two or more users editing data at the same time.</P>
<P>You can use the All Records setting when you need to ensure that no changes are made to data after you start to preview or print a report or run an append, delete, make-table, or update query.</P>
<P>In Form view or Datasheet view, each locked record has a locked symbol in its record selector.</P>
