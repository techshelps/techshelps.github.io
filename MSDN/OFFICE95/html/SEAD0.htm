<H2>Other Considerations When Writing Transportable Visual&nbsp;Basic&nbsp;Code</H2><P CLASS="t">There are other things you need to consider when you're writing code that can vary by locale. The following are the most common of these considerations:</P>
<UL><LI>Comparing strings
<P CLASS="lt1">The rules for comparing strings vary by locale when you're using the less-than (<B>&lt;</B>), greater-than (<B>&gt;</B>), equal-to (<B>=</B>), and <B>Like</B> operators, and the <B>StrComp</B> function. For more information, see "Option<I> </I>Compare," "Like," and "StrComp" in Help.</P></LI><LI>Working with file input and output
<P CLASS="lt1">Locale is also a consideration for file input and output. The <B>Print #</B> statement writes to data into a file as the data is displayed on-screen in a locale-aware format. The <B>Input #</B> statement cannot read this information from the file. By comparison, the <B>Write #</B> statement puts data into a file in a fixed format, which ensures that the <B>Input #</B> statement can read it later in any user locale.</P></LI><LI>Using the macro recorder
<P CLASS="lt1">The macro recorder records your actions in a module in the language specified on the Module General Tab, not in the language of the worksheet. If, for example, your language setting is English/United States and your locale setting (the setting for the worksheet) is French/France, the macro is recorded in English.</P>

<P CLASS="lt1">You can use the <B>FormulaLocal</B> property to return a formula, as a string, in the same format in which it would be displayed in the formula bar (including the equal sign). For more information about the <B>FormulaLocal</B> property, see "Working with Formulas" earlier in this appendix.</P></LI></UL><P></P></FONT>
