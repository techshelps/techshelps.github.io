<H1>Working with Data Access Objects</H1><P CLASS="t">DAO (data access objects) is a library of objects, properties, and methods that you use to retrieve, edit, or delete data stored in a database or to change the structure of a database. Using DAO, you can insert cell values from a Microsoft Excel worksheet into records in a database; you can query a data set and bring the result set into Microsoft Excel for charting or presentation; and you can change relationships between tables.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Note that anything that you do using DAO is subject to the object permissions granted by the login user name and the login password — DAO isn't designed as a way around database security.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="nh"><B>Important</B></P>
<P CLASS="nt">Any changes you make to the database using DAO are permanent. If you delete a record from a base table, for example, using a DAO method in your function, the record will be physically deleted from the table and cannot be recovered.</P>
