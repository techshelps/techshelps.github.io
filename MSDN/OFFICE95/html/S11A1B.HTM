<H1><A NAME="sec136"></A>KeyDown, KeyUp Events</H1><P CLASS="t">  </P>
<H2><A NAME="sec137"></A>Applies To</H2><P>Bound Object Frame Control, Check Box Control, Combo Box Control, Command Button Control, Form, List Box Control, Option Button Control, Text Box Control, Toggle Button Control.</P>
<H2><A NAME="sec138"></A>Description</H2><P>These events occur:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    KeyDown — When the user presses a key while a form or control has the focus. This event also occurs if you send a keystroke to a form or control using the SendKeys action in a macro or the <B>SendKeys</B> statement in Visual Basic.</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    KeyUp — When the user releases a key while a form or control has the focus. This event also occurs if you send a keystroke to a form or control using the SendKeys action in a macro or the <B>SendKeys</B> statement in Visual Basic.</LI></UL></SPAN><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">  </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   The KeyDown and KeyUp events apply only to forms and controls on a form.</P>
<P CLASS="t">  </P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="sec139"></A>Remarks</H2><P>For both events, the object with the focus receives all keystrokes. A form can have the focus only if it has no controls or all its visible controls are disabled.</P>
<P>A form will also receive all keyboard events, even those that occur for controls, if you set the <B>KeyPreview</B> property of the form to Yes. With this property setting, all keyboard events occur first for the form, and then for the control that has the focus. You can respond to specific keys pressed in the form, regardless of which control has the focus. For example, you may want the key combination CTRL+X to always perform the same action on a form.</P>
<P>If you press and hold down a key, the KeyDown event occurs repeatedly until you release the key, then the KeyUp event occurs.</P>
<P>Although the KeyDown and KeyUp events occur when most keys are pressed, they are typically used to recognize or distinguish between:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    Extended character keys, such as function keys.</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    Navigation keys, such as HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, UP ARROW, DOWN ARROW, RIGHT ARROW, LEFT ARROW, and TAB.</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    Combinations of keys and standard keyboard modifiers (SHIFT, CTRL, or ALT keys).</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    The numeric keypad and keyboard number keys.</LI></UL></SPAN><P>The KeyDown and KeyUp events don’t occur when you press:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    The ENTER key if the form has a command button for which the <B>Default</B> property is set to Yes.</LI></UL></SPAN><P><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>The ESC key if the form has a command button for which the <B>Cancel</B> property is set to Yes.</P>
<P CLASS="t">  </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   To find out the ANSI character corresponding to the key pressed, use the KeyPress event.</P>
<P CLASS="t">  </P>
<P></P>
<P>The KeyDown and KeyPress events occur when you press or send an ANSI key. The KeyUp event occurs after any event for a control caused by pressing or sending the key. If a keystroke causes the focus to move from one control to another control, the KeyDown event occurs for the first control, while the KeyPress and KeyUp events occur for the second control.</P>
