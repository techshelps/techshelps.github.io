<H2><A NAME="sec305"></A>Description</H2><P>These events occur:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    Delete — when the user performs some action, such as pressing the DEL key, to delete a record, but before the record is actually deleted.</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    BeforeDelConfirm — after the user deletes one or more records, but before Microsoft Access displays a dialog box asking the user to confirm the deletions.</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    AfterDelConfirm — after the user confirms the deletions and the records are actually deleted or when the deletions are canceled.</LI></UL></SPAN><H2><A NAME="sec306"></A>Remarks</H2><P>After a record is deleted, it’s stored in a temporary buffer. The BeforeDelConfirm event occurs after the Delete event (or if you’ve deleted more than one record, after all the records are deleted), but before the delete confirm dialog box is displayed. Canceling the BeforeDelConfirm event restores a record from the buffer and prevents the delete confirm dialog box from being displayed.</P>
<P>The AfterDelConfirm event occurs after a record is actually deleted or after a deletion is canceled. If the BeforeDelConfirm event isn’t canceled, the AfterDelConfirm event occurs after the delete confirm dialog box is displayed. The AfterDelConfirm event occurs even if the BeforeDelConfirm event is canceled. The AfterDelConfirm event procedure returns status information about the deletion. You can use a macro or event procedure associated with the AfterDelConfirm event to recalculate totals affected by the deletion of records.</P>
<P>If you cancel the Delete event, the BeforeDelConfirm and AfterDelConfirm events don’t occur and the delete confirm dialog box isn’t displayed.</P>
<P>By running a macro or executing an event procedure when the Delete event occurs, you can prevent a record from being deleted or allow a record to be deleted only under certain conditions. You can also use a Delete event to display a dialog box asking whether the user wants to delete a record before it’s deleted.</P>
<P>To delete a record, you must first click the record selector or choose Select Record from the Edit menu to select the record. If you click the record selector of the current record or choose Select Record, the Exit and LostFocus events for the control that has the focus occur. If you’ve changed any data in the record, the BeforeUpdate and AfterUpdate events for the record occur before the Exit and LostFocus events. If you click the record selector of a different record, the Current event for that record also occurs.</P>
<P>After you delete the record, the focus moves to the next record following the deleted record, and the Current event for that record occurs, followed by the Enter and GotFocus events for the first control in that record.</P>
<P>The BeforeDelConfirm event then occurs, just before Microsoft Access displays a dialog box asking you to confirm the deletion. After you respond to the dialog box (or after the deletion is confirmed or canceled), the AfterDelConfirm event occurs. (However, the BeforeDelConfirm and AfterDelConfirm events don’t occur and the deletion confirmation dialog box isn’t displayed if you set the Confirm Record Changes option in the Edit/Find tab of the Options dialog box to No.)</P>
<P>You can delete one or more records at a time. The Delete event occurs after each record is deleted. This enables you to access the data in each record before it’s actually deleted, and selectively confirm or cancel each deletion in the Delete macro or event procedure. When you delete more than one record, the Current event for the record following the last deleted record and the Enter and GotFocus events for the first control in this record don’t occur until all the records are deleted. In other words, a Delete event occurs for each selected record, but no other events occur until all the selected records are deleted. The BeforeDelConfirm and AfterDelConfirm events also don’t occur until all the selected records are deleted.</P>
