<H2>Guidelines for Customizing Toolbars</H2><P CLASS="t">Microsoft Excel offers you a wide range of ways to modify the built-in toolbar system to better serve the needs of the user. You can create new toolbars; add new toolbar buttons to built-in or custom toolbars; modify the image on a toolbar button face; and assign macros, ToolTip text, and status bar text to toolbar buttons. If a toolbar button contains an edit box or a text box, you can adjust the width of the box. </P>
<P CLASS="t">Whether you modify a built-in toolbar or create a new one depends on the extent of the changes you want to make. Modifying a built-in toolbar makes sense if you're adding or changing only a few toolbar buttons; creating a new toolbar may be more convenient if you want to provide an entirely different assortment of commands than are found on any of the built-in toolbars or if you want to present a number of custom toolbar buttons as a distinct group. Regardless of how many changes you make, you can restore the built-in menu system to its default state whenever you want.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition to the above changes, which are usually made at <I>design time</I>, you can use Visual Basic procedures to change the properties of toolbars and toolbar buttons in response to user input while your application is running (at <I>run time</I>). For example, you can hide a toolbar when the user no longer needs it, move or resize a toolbar to keep it out of the user's way, disable a toolbar button to prevent the user from clicking it at an inappropriate time, or switch between the "pushed" appearance and the "not pushed" appearance of a toolbar button every time the user clicks it.</P></FONT>
