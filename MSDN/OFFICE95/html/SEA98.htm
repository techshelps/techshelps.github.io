<H1>Improving Performance with Add-Ins</H1><P CLASS="t">You can improve your code's performance by compiling a workbook to an add-in. In a workbook that isn't an add-in, Visual Basic uses incremental compilation to reduce the amount of time it takes to compile changes to code. However, when you compile an add-in, Visual Basic fully compiles the code, which may slightly improve performance.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can further improve performance by compiling the add-in on the platform in which you want to run it. For example, you can write an add-in that runs in both the Windows and Macintosh operating systems. Although you can successfully move the compiled add-in from one platform to another, performance suffers. Instead, move the source workbook and recompile it in the other platform.</P></FONT>
