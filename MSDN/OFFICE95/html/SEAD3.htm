<H2>Working in Multiple Locales</H2><P CLASS="t">There's one locale setting stored with each workbook, so different workbooks can have different settings, even if all the workbooks are open at the same time. With this feature, you can write and call procedures written in several languages.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Visual Basic doesn't automatically translate existing code from one language into another. You must edit the code using the same locale setting that was used when the code was originally written. Using multiple locales requires using multiple workbooks and multiple object libraries. However, you can edit the code with any language version of Microsoft Excel; for example, you can edit Dutch code using Norwegian Microsoft Excel, but the code will be displayed in Dutch.</P></FONT>
