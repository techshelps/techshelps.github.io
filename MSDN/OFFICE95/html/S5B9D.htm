<H1>Using Custom Dialog Boxes</H1><P CLASS="t">When you need to manage a complex interaction between the user and your application, it's usually best to create a custom dialog box. The custom dialog box can present all the options in one location, making it easier to read and use than controls placed directly on a worksheet or chart sheet. When the user is finished choosing options from the dialog box, the dialog box can be dismissed; this way, the controls take up screen space only as long as they're needed.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Creating and managing a custom dialog box is more complex than using controls directly on a sheet, however. You must carefully consider the trade-off between the convenience to the user and the amount of work involved for you to create and manage the dialog box.</P></FONT>
