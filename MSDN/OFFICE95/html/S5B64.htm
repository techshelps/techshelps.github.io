<H1>Stepping Through Code</H1><P CLASS="t">If you know exactly which statement caused an error, the use of a single breakpoint may be sufficient. More often, however, you can only guess the general vicinity of the statement that caused the error. Setting a breakpoint helps you get to that general area; when you get there, you can step through your code and execute it line by line to see the effect of each statement.</P>
<P CLASS="t">You can also step through each line of code in a called procedure (a procedure the current procedure calls) or step over the called procedure code.</P></FONT>
