<P CLASS="spacing"><BR></P><H2><A NAME="sec470"></A>Remarks</H2><P>Use the <B>SetFocus</B> method when you want a particular field or control to have the focus so that all user input is directed to this object.</P>
<P>In order to read some of the properties of a control, you need to ensure that that control has the focus. For example, a text box must have the focus before you can read its <B>Text</B> property.</P>
<P>Other properties can be set only when a control doesn’t have the focus. For example, you can’t set a control’s <B>Visible</B> or <B>Locked</B> properties to <B>False</B> when that control has the focus.</P>
<P>You can also use the <B>SetFocus</B> method to navigate in a form according to certain conditions. For example, if the user selects Not Applicable for the first of a set of questions on a form that is a questionnaire, your Visual Basic code might then automatically skip the questions in that set and move the focus to the first control in the next set of questions.</P>
<P>You can move the focus only to a visible control or form. A form and controls on a form aren’t visible until the form’s Load event has finished. Therefore, if you use the <B>SetFocus</B> method in a form’s Load event to move the focus to that form, you must use the <B>Repaint</B> method before the <B>SetFocus</B> method.</P>
<P>You can’t move the focus to a control if its <B>Enabled</B> property is set to <B>False</B>. You must set a control’s <B>Enabled</B> property to <B>True</B> before you can move the focus to that control. You can, however, move the focus to a control if its <B>Locked</B> property is set to <B>True</B>.</P>
<P>If a form contains controls for which the <B>Enabled</B> property is set to <B>True</B>, you can’t move the focus to the form itself. You can only move the focus to controls on the form. In this case, if you try to use <B>SetFocus</B> to move the focus to a form, the focus is set to the control on the form that last received the focus.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">  </P>
<P><B>Tip</B>   You can use the <B>SetFocus</B> method to move the focus to a subform, which is a type of control. You can also move the focus to a control on a subform by using the <B>SetFocus</B> method twice, moving the focus first to the subform and then to the control on the subform.</P>
