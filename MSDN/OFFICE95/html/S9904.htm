<H2>Working With User Dialogs</H2><P CLASS="t">Excel 7 has a new dialog editor that's a dream compared to the one in Excel 4.  There's graphical support for laying out all dialog box controls, and the right mouse button works to set the control properties.  In addition to the standard controls (buttons, check boxes, etc.) it's now possible to place drawing objects in a dialog box, so it's easy to make some imaginative user dialogs.  Code can even set properties of the drawing objects at runtime.  Read on to see some of the possibilities.  </P></FONT>
