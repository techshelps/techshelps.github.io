<H2><A NAME="sec100"></A>Applies To</H2><P>Form.</P>
<H2><A NAME="sec101"></A>Description</H2><P>You can use the <B>Bookmark</B> property with forms to set a bookmark that uniquely identifies a particular record in the form’s underlying table, query, or SQL statement.</P>
<H2><A NAME="sec102"></A>Setting</H2><P>The <B>Bookmark</B> property contains a string expression created by Microsoft Access.</P>
<P>You can access this property using Visual Basic or a macro.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">  </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   You get or set the form’s <B>Bookmark</B> property separately from the underlying table or query data access <B>Bookmark</B> property.</P>
<P CLASS="t">  </P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="sec103"></A>Remarks</H2><P>When a bound form is opened in Form view, each record is assigned a unique bookmark. In Visual Basic, you can save the bookmark for the current record by assigning the value of the form’s <B>Bookmark</B> property to a string variable. To return to a saved record after moving to a different record, set the form’s <B>Bookmark</B> property to the value of the saved string variable.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">  </P>
<P><B>Note</B>   Bookmarks are not saved with the records they represent. They are re-created by Microsoft Access each time a bound form is opened.</P>
<P CLASS="t">  </P>
<P></P>
<P>There is no limit to the number of bookmarks you can save if each is saved with a unique string variable.</P>
<P>The <B>Bookmark</B> property is only available for the form’s current record. To save a bookmark for a record other than the current record, move to the desired record and assign the value of the <B>Bookmark</B> property with a string variable that identifies this record.</P>
<P>You can use bookmarks in any form that is based entirely on Microsoft Access tables. However, other database products may not support bookmarks. For example, you can’t use bookmarks in a form based on a linked table that has no primary index.</P>
<P>Requerying a form invalidates any bookmarks set on records in the form. However, clicking Refresh on the Records menu doesn’t affect bookmarks.</P>
<P>Since Microsoft Access creates a unique bookmark for each record in a form’s recordset when a form is opened, a form’s bookmark will not work on another recordset, even when the two recordsets are based on the same table, query or SQL statement. For example, suppose you open a form bound to the Customers table. If you then open the Customers table using Visual Basic and use the <B>Seek</B> method to locate a specific record in the table, you can’t set the form’s <B>Bookmark</B> property to the current table record. To perform this kind of operation you use the form’s <B>RecordsetClone</B> property.</P>
<P>A trappable error occurs if you save the <B>Bookmark</B> property with a string variable and then try to return to that record after the record has been deleted.</P>
<P>The value of the <B>Bookmark</B> property isn’t the same as a record number.</P>
