<H2>Where Are You?</H2><P CLASS="t">This book assumes that you already know how to use Microsoft Excel. If you're new to Microsoft Excel, you should set this book aside for now. For general information about Microsoft Excel, see <I>Getting Results with Microsoft Excel for Windows 95</I> or <I>Getting Results with Microsoft Office for Windows 95.</I></P>
<P CLASS="t">You can record and use macros in Microsoft Excel without learning Visual Basic. If you've never recorded or run a Visual Basic macro, see the topics listed under "Recording and Running Macros" on the Contents tab in Help.</P>

<P CLASS="nh"><B>Note</B></P>
<P CLASS="nt">If you clicked Typical when you installed Microsoft Excel, you'll need to run Setup again to install the Visual Basic Help file. For more information, see "Using Online Help" later in this introduction.</P>

<P CLASS="t">This book is designed for intermediate users of Visual Basic in Microsoft Excel. It provides information based on subject area rather than specific tasks. If you're new to Visual Basic in Microsoft Excel, or if you prefer a more task-oriented approach, you might want to start by reading <I>Microsoft Excel Visual Basic Step by Step</I>, a self-paced tutorial available from Microsoft Press&reg;; then you can use this book to customize and optimize what you've learned.</P>
