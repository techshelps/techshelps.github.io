<FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA" SIZE="2"><H2 CLASS="h1">Loading the Workgroup Extensions</H2><P CLASS="t">The WordBasic MAPI functions are provided in WBMAPI.DLL, a Windows dynamic-link library (DLL) provided on the Microsoft Word Developer's Kit disk. Copy WBMAPI.DLL from either the WIN16 (Windows 3.<I>x</I>) or the WIN32 (Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows NT) subfolder in the WBMAPI folder to the user's Windows System folder, or to any folder recognized automatically by the operating system. Every user of a workgroup application based on WBMAPI.DLL must have this file installed.</P>
<P CLASS="t">All of the <B>Declare</B> statements for the WBMAPI.DLL functions documented in this appendix, as well as useful constants, are included in the aaAllDeclarations macro, which is stored in WBMAPI.DOT, a template in the WBMAPI folder on the Microsoft Word Developer's Kit disk. Copy these declarations from the macro and include them in every macro you create that uses the WBMAPI.DLL functions.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In addition to aaAllDeclarations, many example macros are contained in WBMAPI.DOT; they provide a good starting point for building new applications that use the workgroup extensions. Users do not require WBMAPI.DOT.</P></FONT></FONT></BODY></HTML>
