<H1>ApplyFilter Action</h1>

<H2>Description</h2>

<p class="t">You can use the ApplyFilter action to apply a
filter, a query, or an SQL WHERE clause to a table, form, or
report to restrict or sort the records in the table, or the
records from the underlying table or query of the form or report.
For reports, you can use this action only in a macro specified by
the report&#146;s <b>OnOpen</b> event property.</p>

<H2>Setting</h2>

<p class="t">The ApplyFilter action uses the following arguments.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="7" cols="2">
    <tr>
        <td><b>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">Action argument</b></td>
        <td><b>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">Description</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">Filter Name</td>
        <td valign="top">
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">The name of a filter or query that
        restricts or sorts the records of the table, form, or
        report. You can enter the name of either an existing
        query or a filter that has been saved as a query.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">Where Condition</td>
        <td valign="top">
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">A valid SQL WHERE clause (without the
        word WHERE) or an expression that restricts the records
        of the table, form or report.</td>
    </tr>
</TBODY></table>

<p class="spacing"><br>
</p>

<p class="nt"><b>Note</b> In the Where Condition expression, the
left side of the expression typically contains a field name from
the underlying table or query for the form or report. The right
side of the expression typically contains the criteria you want
to apply to this field in order to restrict or sort the records.
For example, the criteria can be the name of a control on another
form that contains the value you want the records in the first
form to match. The name of the control should be fully qualified:
<b>Forms!</b><i>formname</i><b>!</b><i>controlname</i>.</p>

<p class="t">The maximum length of the Where Condition argument
is 256 characters. If you need to enter a longer SQL WHERE
clause, use the <b>ApplyFilter</b> method of the <b>DoCmd</b>
object in Visual Basic. You can enter SQL WHERE clause statements
of up to 32,768 characters in Visual Basic.</p>

<p class="nt"><b>Note</b> You must use one or both arguments. You
can use the Filter Name argument if you&#146;ve already defined a
filter that provides the appropriate data. You can use the Where
Condition argument to enter the restriction criteria directly. If
you use both arguments, Microsoft Access applies the WHERE clause
to the results of the filter.</p>

<H2>Remarks</h2>

<p class="t">You can apply a filter or query to a form in Form
view or Datasheet view.</p>

<p class="t">For tables and forms, this action is similar to
clicking Apply Filter/Sort on the Records menu or clicking the
Apply Filter button on the toolbar. The menu command or button
applies the most recently created filter to the table or form,
whereas the ApplyFilter action applies a specified filter or
query.</p>

<p class="t">If you point to Filters on the Records menu and then
click Advanced Filter/Sort after running the ApplyFilter action,
the Advanced Filter/Sort window shows the filter criteria you
have selected with this action.</p>

<p class="t">To remove a filter and display all of the records
for a table or form, you can use the ShowAllRecords action, the
Remove Filter/Sort command on the Records menu, or the Remove
Filter button on the toolbar.</p>

<p class="t">When you save a table or form, Microsoft Access
saves any filter currently defined in that object, but won&#146;t
apply the filter automatically the next time the object is opened
(although it will automatically apply any sort you applied to the
object before it was saved). If you want to apply a filter
automatically when a form is first opened, specify a macro using
the ApplyFilter action or an event procedure using the <b>ApplyFilter</b>
method of the <b>DoCmd</b> object as the <b>OnOpen</b> event
property setting of the form. You can also apply a filter using
the OpenForm or OpenReport action, or their corresponding
methods. To apply a filter automatically when a table is first
opened, you can open the table using a macro containing the
OpenTable action, followed immediately by an ApplyFilter action.</p>
