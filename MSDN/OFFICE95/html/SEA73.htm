<H1>Design-Time Modifications to Toolbars and Toolbar Buttons</H1><P CLASS="t">The simplest way to make design-time changes to toolbars or toolbar buttons is from the user interface. To display the Customize dialog box, click Toolbars on the View menu, and then click Customize.</P>
<P CLASS="t">With the Customize dialog box open, you can create a new toolbar, add new or built-in toolbar buttons to a toolbar, delete toolbar buttons from a toolbar, adjust spacing between toolbar buttons, and change the width of a toolbar button containing an edit box. You can use the Button Image Editor to customize the image associated with a particular toolbar button; and you can use the Assign Macro dialog box to assign a procedure that runs when the user clicks that toolbar button.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Although the user interface provides the most practical way to make design-time changes to the toolbars, you can also make these changes using Visual Basic. If you want to see how Visual Basic would make a particular change, turn on the macro recorder, make the change manually, stop the recorder, and then examine the code that the macro recorder has produced. If you want more information about a specific object, property, or method that you find in the code, click anywhere in the term in question, and press F1. For more information about using the macro recorder, see "Recording and Running Macros" in Help.</P></FONT>
