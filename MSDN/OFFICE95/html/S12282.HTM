<P CLASS="t">This reference manual has four sections:</P>
<H2>Language Summary</H2><P CLASS="t">This section provides a quick reference for finding information about related functions, statements, objects, methods, properties, events, actions, operators, and keywords.</P>
<H2>A-Z Reference</H2><P CLASS="t">
This section includes detailed descriptions of the functions, statements, objects, methods, properties, events, actions, operators, and keywords provided by Visual Basic and by Microsoft Access. It also provides code examples that show how to use selected elements in Visual Basic code.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If a method or property provided by Microsoft Access has the same name as one provided by Visual Basic, the topic title denotes whether the method or property is supplied by Microsoft Access or by Visual Basic. For example, the Microsoft Access <B>Count </B>property topic is titled “Count Property (Microsoft Access),” and the Visual Basic <B>Count </B>property is titled “Count Property (Visual Basic).”</P>
<P CLASS="t">Some Visual Basic topics include Microsoft Access-specific information in addition to general programming information. This information follows the general information in the topic.</P>
<P CLASS="t">In most cases you don’t need to know whether a language element is provided by Visual Basic or by Microsoft Access when you’re programming. This book distinguishes between the two because some objects and their methods and properties are provided by Microsoft Access, and some are provided by Visual Basic. If you look up these objects, methods, and properties in the Object Browser, you’ll need to know whether they are supplied by Visual Basic or by Microsoft Access. For more information on using the Object Browser, search the online index for “Object Browser,” or ask the Answer Wizard.</P>
<H2>Appendixes</H2><P CLASS="t">This section includes a graphical representation of the Microsoft Access object hierarchy and a table of ANSI values.</P>
<H2>Index</H2><P CLASS="t">This section provides a complete index of all reference topics in this book.
