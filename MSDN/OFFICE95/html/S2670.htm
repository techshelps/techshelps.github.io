<P CLASS="sbrt">WBODBC.WLL is not supported by Microsoft Corporation. It is provided "as is" because we believe it may be useful to you. We regret that Microsoft is unable to support or assist you, should you have problems using this tool or any code that relies on this tool.</P>

<P CLASS="t">With the functions provided in the ODBC add-in library for Microsoft Word, you can create WordBasic macros that can access data in any database management system (DBMS) that supports the open database connectivity (ODBC) application programming interface (API) standard. With the ODBC extensions, you can:</P>
<UL><LI>    Update data or add new data to a DBMS data source.
<P CLASS="lt1">For example, employees can update personnel records in a DBMS by filling in a form in Word. Or you can add a table of data created in Word as a new data source in an existing database.</P></LI><LI>    Retrieve data for use as a mail-merge data source and insert tables of data in<BR>a document.
<P CLASS="lt1">With the ODBC extensions, you can access data directly from a DBMS through Structured Query Language (SQL) statements. If you are retrieving large amounts of data or retrieving data from large databases, bypassing the Word command interface can speed data access.</P></LI><LI>    Retrieve data for use in calculations by other WordBasic functions.
<P CLASS="lt1">For example, you can create a macro to retrieve the daily price of commodities and interest rates from your company's database and then use the values as variables in calculating projected expenses.</P></LI><LI>    Interactively compose and issue queries and retrieve results from the database.</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Information in this appendix is intended only for WordBasic programmers. If you are developing C language or Visual Basic applications that support the ODBC API, you can obtain the Microsoft ODBC Software Development Kit version 2.10 as part of a Level 2 membership in the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). To join MSDN in the United States and Canada, call (800) 759-5474 from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (Pacific time), Monday through Friday. Outside North America, contact your local Microsoft subsidiary, or call (303) 684-0914 in the United States to obtain local contact information. The ODBC SDK isn't required to use the ODBC extensions in the WBODBC.WLL add-in that is provided in the <I>Microsoft Word Developer's Kit</I>.</P>
