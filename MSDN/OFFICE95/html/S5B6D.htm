<H1>Inspecting Code and Data in the Immediate Pane</H1><P CLASS="t">When you're creating and testing Visual Basic code, you may often want to check the results of an expression, the value of a property, and so on. You can do this in the Immediate pane of the Debug window. The Immediate pane is a kind of "scratch pad" window in which expressions are evaluated immediately.</P>
<P CLASS="proch"><B><img src="prcarrow.gif">    To view the Immediate pane</B></P>
<P CLASS="ls">    1.    Enter break mode, or click Debug Window on the View menu. The Debug window appears.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">    2.    If the Immediate pane isn't on top, click the Immediate tab.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">There are several uses for the Immediate pane: checking the values of properties; evaluating expressions; printing the results of expressions; and printing the values of properties. You can also test your <B>Sub</B> and <B>Function</B> procedures by calling them from the Immediate pane. And when you're in break mode, you can use the Immediate pane to examine the values of variables and arguments in a procedure.</P></FONT>
