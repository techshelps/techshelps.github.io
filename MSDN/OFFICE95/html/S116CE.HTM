<h1><a name="sec197"></a>Echo Method (Application Object)</h1>

<h2><a name="sec198"></a>Description</h2>

<p>The <b>Echo</b> method specifies whether Microsoft Access
repaints or updates the computer screen.</p>

<h2><a name="sec199"></a>Syntax</h2>

<p><b>Application.Echo</b> <i>echoon</i>[, <i>statusbartext</i>]</p>

<p>The <b>Echo</b> method uses the following arguments.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="7" cols="2">
    <tr>
        <td><b>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">Argument</b></td>
        <td><b>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">Description</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2"><i>echoon</i></td>
        <td valign="top">
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2"><b>True</b> (default) indicates that the
        screen is repainted; <b>False</b> indicates that the
        screen isn&#146;t repainted.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2"><i>statusbartext</i></td>
        <td valign="top">
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">Optional string expression that
        specifies the text to display in the status bar when
        repainting is turned on or off.</td>
    </tr>

<h2><a name="sec200"></a>Remarks</h2>

<p>If you are running Visual Basic code that makes a number of
changes to objects displayed on the screen, your code may be
faster if you turn off screen repainting until the procedure has
finished running. You may also want to turn repainting off if
your code makes changes that the user shouldn&#146;t see or
doesn&#146;t need to see.</p>

<p>The <b>Echo</b> method doesn&#146;t suppress the display of
modal dialog boxes, such as error messages, or pop-up forms, such
as property sheets.</p>

<p>If you turn screen repainting off, the screen will not show
any changes, even if the user presses CTRL+BREAK or Visual Basic
encounters a breakpoint, until you turn screen repainting back
on. You may want to create a macro that turns repainting on and
assign the macro to a key or custom menu command. You can then
use the key combination or menu command to turn repainting on if
it has been turned off in Visual Basic.</p>

<p>If you turn screen repainting off and then try to step through
your code, you won&#146;t be able to see your progress through
the code, or any other visual cues, until repainting is turned
back on. However, your code will continue to execute.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> Don&#146;t confuse the <b>Echo</b> method with the
<b>Repaint</b> method. The <b>Echo</b> method turns screen
updating on or off. The <b>Repaint</b> method forces an immediate
screen update.</p>

<h2><a name="sec201"></a>See Also</h2>

<p><b>Application</b> Object, Echo Action.</p>

<h2><a name="sec202"></a>Example</h2>

<p>The following example uses the <b>Echo</b> method to prevent
the screen from being repainted while certain operations are
underway. While the procedure opens a form and minimizes it, the
user only sees an hourglass to indicate that processing is taking
place, and the screen is not repainted. When this task is
completed, the hourglass changes back to a pointer and screen
repainting is restored.</p>
