<H1>    SOLVER.ADD</H1><P CLASS="t">Macro Sheets Only</P>
<P CLASS="t">Equivalent to choosing the Solver command from the Tools menu and choosing the Add button in the Solver Parameters dialog box. Adds a constraint to the current problem. For an explanation of constraints, see "Remarks" later in this topic.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If this function is not available, you must install the Solver add-in macro.</P>
<P CLASS="h"><B>Syntax</B></P>
<P CLASS="syn"><B>SOLVER.ADD</B>(<B>cell_ref, relation, </B>formula)</P>
<P CLASS="t">Cell_ref    is a reference to a cell or range of cells on the active sheet and forms the left side of the constraint.</P>
<P CLASS="t">Relation    specifies the arithmetic relationship between the left and right sides, or whether cell_ref must be an integer.</P>
<P>Relation    Arithmetic relationship</P>
<P CLASS="tr">    </P>
<P>1    &lt;=</P>
<P>2    =</P>
<P>3    &gt;=</P>
<P>4    Int (cell_ref is an integer)</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Formula    is the right side of the constraint and will often be a single number, but it may be a formula (as text) or a reference to a range of cells.</P>
<UL><LI>If relation is 4, cell_ref must be a subset of the references in the By Changing cells text box.</LI><LI>if relation is 4, formula must be either "=integer" or "integer".</LI><LI>Any cell reference in a formula must use the R1C1 reference style.</LI><LI>If formula is a reference to a range of cells, the number of cells in the range usually matches the number of cells in cell_ref, although the shape of the areas need not be the same. For example, cell_ref could be a row and formula could refer to a column, as long as the number of cells is the same. Formula can also be a single reference, as in the following relationship: &nbsp;A1:A4&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;B1.</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="h"><B>Remarks</B></P>
<UL><LI>The SOLVER.ADD, SOLVER.CHANGE and SOLVER.DELETE functions correspond to the Add, Change, and Delete buttons in the Tools Solver Parameters dialog box. You use these functions to define constraints. For many macro applications, however, you may find it more convenient to load the problem specifications from the sheet in a single step using the SOLVER.LOAD function.</LI><LI>Each constraint is uniquely identified by the combination of the cell reference on the left and the relationship (&lt;=, =, or &gt;=) between its left and right sides, or the cell reference may be defined as an integer only. This takes the place of selecting the appropriate constraint in the Tools Solver Parameters dialog box. You can manipulate the constraints with SOLVER.CHANGE or SOLVER.DELETE. The constraints in a Solver problem can refer to a maximum of 400 cells.</LI></UL><P></P>
