<H2>Distributing Object Libraries</H2><P CLASS="t">If your Visual Basic code isn't written in English (with the English/United States option selected on the Module General tab), you must either include the appropriate language object libraries when you distribute your application or make sure that the recipients already have the appropriate object libraries installed on their computers. If your code calls procedures written in multiple languages, you should include the object libraries for each of those languages. You should also include all workbooks and other object libraries that are referenced by the application you're distributing.</P>

<P CLASS="nh"><B>Note</B></P>
<P CLASS="nt">Microsoft allows all registered owners of Microsoft Excel to distribute object libraries with their applications to other registered owners as necessary.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">Object libraries are platform-specific, so if you plan to distribute your workbooks both to users of Microsoft Excel for Windows and users of Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, you must include both the Windows and Macintosh versions of the object libraries.</P></FONT>
