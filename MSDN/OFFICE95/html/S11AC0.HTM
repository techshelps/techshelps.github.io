<H2>Applies To</H2><P>Form.</P>
<H2><A NAME="sec0"></A>Description</H2><P>These events occur:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    Load — When a form is opened and its records are displayed. The Load event can occur when an application starts, when the OpenForm action is used, or when the user opens a form by choosing the Open button in the Database window.</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    Unload — When a form is closed but before it’s removed from the screen. When the form is reloaded, Microsoft Access redisplays the form and reinitializes the contents of all its controls.</LI></UL></SPAN><H2><A NAME="sec1"></A>Remarks</H2><P>The Unload event is caused by user actions such as:</P>
<SPAN CLASS="list"><UL><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    Clicking Close on the File menu or a form’s Control menu.</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    Running the Close action in a macro.</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    Quitting an application by choosing the End Task button in the Microsoft Windows Task List.</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="Symbol"></SPAN>    Quitting Windows while an application is running.</LI></UL></SPAN><P>By running a macro or executing an event procedure when a form’s Unload event occurs, you can verify that the form should be unloaded or specify actions that should take place when the form is unloaded. You can also open another form or display a dialog box requesting the user’s name to make a log entry indicating who used the form.</P>
<P>When you first open a form, the following events occur in this order:</P>
<P Class="t">    Open <IMG SRC=rarrow.gif> Load <IMG SRC=rarrow.gif> Resize <IMG SRC=rarrow.gif> Activate <IMG SRC=rarrow.gif>
<P>If you’re trying to decide whether to use the Open or Load event for your macro or event procedure, one significant difference is that the Open event can be canceled, but the Load event can’t. For example, if you’re dynamically building a record source for a form in an event procedure for the form’s Open event, you can cancel opening the form if there are no records to display.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Note</B>   When you create macros or event procedures for events related to the Load event, such as Activate and GotFocus, be sure that they don’t conflict (for example, make sure you don’t cause something to happen in one macro or procedure that is canceled in another) and that they don’t cause cascading events.</P>
<P CLASS="t">  </P>
<P></P>
<P>The Unload event occurs before the Close event. The Unload event can be canceled, but the Close event can’t.</P>
