<H1>General Guidelines</H1><P CLASS="t">Use the following guidelines to write Visual Basic code that runs effectively in other locales. These guidelines are presented as three scenarios, beginning with the scenario that provides the safest and most predictable results. If you understand these three scenarios, you can better predict how your distributed code will perform.</P>
<UL><LI>Write your code in English (with English/United States selected in the Language/Country box on the Module General Tab in the Options dialog box (Tools menu)). The code will run on any computer running Microsoft Excel because Microsoft Excel registers the English object libraries as the default libraries during installation.</LI><LI>Write your code in any localized language, and distribute the code with the corresponding object library files. The code will run correctly on the localized machine if the accompanying object is installed. For a complete list of languages and their corresponding object libraries, see "Names of the Object Library Files" later in this appendix.</LI><LI>Write your code in any localized language, and distribute the code without object library files. The code will only run on computers that already have the proper object library files installed. For a complete list of languages and their corresponding object libraries, see "Names of the Object Library Files" later in this appendix.</LI></UL><P></P>

<P CLASS="nh"><B>Important</B></P>
<P CLASS="nt">Don't write Visual Basic code for distribution to other computers with English/(Custom) selected in the Language/Country box on the Module General Tab in the Options dialog box (Tools menu). Code you write with that option in effect won't run properly on other computers.</P>
