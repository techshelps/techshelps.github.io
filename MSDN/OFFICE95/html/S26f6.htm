<H1 CLASS="cht">AppleScript</H1><P CLASS="t">Word supports AppleScript scripting on the Apple Macintosh. Word supports the Required, Core, Table, and Text suites of Apple Events, as defined by the Apple Event Registry. In addition, Word defines four objects, one event, and approximately 68 properties for use in AppleScript scripts that interact with Word.</P>
<P CLASS="t">To use AppleScript with Word, you must have the following:</P>
<UL><LI>    Microsoft Word version 6.0</LI><LI>    Apple Macintosh System 7 or later</LI><LI>    AppleScript extension version 1.1</LI><LI>    Apple Script Editor or another scripting application compatible with Open Scripting Architecture (OSA)</LI></UL><P></P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="nh"><B>Note</B></P>
<P CLASS="nt">This appendix assumes that you are using Script Editor, the application provided in the AppleScript Developer's Toolkit from Apple Computer, Inc. Any OSA-compatible script editing application can use the same information to create scripts for Microsoft Word version 6.0.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">To use this appendix, you should already be familiar with AppleScript and scripting on the Macintosh. The reference section of this appendix describes only the new objects, events, and properties created for use with Word version 6.0. The remaining objects, events, and properties that Word shares with other scriptable applications are described in your scripting documentation. For more information about AppleScript, see <I>Getting Started with AppleScript</I> and <I>AppleScript Language Guide</I>, both included in the AppleScript Developer's Tookit version 1.1 from Apple Computer, Inc.</P></FONT></FONT></BODY></HTML>
