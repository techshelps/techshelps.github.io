<FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA" SIZE="2"><H1 CLASS="h1">Language Differences Across Versions of Word</H1><P CLASS="t">The <I>Microsoft Word Developer's Kit</I> documents the WordBasic programming language for the following versions of Microsoft Word:</P>
<UL><LI>    Microsoft Word versions 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0c for Windows (referred to as Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows)</LI><LI>    Microsoft Word version 6.0 for the Macintosh</LI><LI>    Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows NT</LI><LI>    Microsoft Word for Windows 95 (referred to as Microsoft Word version 7.0)</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">All these versions of Word share a majority of WordBasic's functionality. However, there are a handful of differences in WordBasic between each version. For example:</P>
<UL><LI>    Word version 6.0 for the Macintosh cannot run statements such as <B>AppActivate</B> and <B>AppSendMessage </B>that rely on Windows features, while the Windows versions of Word cannot run statements such as <B>EditPublish</B> and <B>EditSubscribe</B> that rely on Macintosh features.</LI><LI>    None of the versions of Word earlier than Word version 7.0 can run statements and functions for Word features that were added to Word for Windows 95.</LI><LI>    In Word version 6.0 for Windows NT and Word version 7.0, the arguments for <B>GetPrivateProfileString$</B><B>()</B> and <B>SetPrivateProfileString</B> changed to allow setting and returning values in the registry.</LI></UL><P></P>
<P CLASS="t">The following sections list these and other differences in detail. You can use this information along with the cross-platform programming guidelines in Chapter 9, "More WordBasicTechniques," (Part 1, "Learning WordBasic") to develop WordBasic macros that run without error in any version of Word listed earlier.</P></FONT></FONT></BODY></HTML>
