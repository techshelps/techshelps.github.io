<H1 CLASS="cht">Chapter 11 Automatic Procedures and OnEvent Procedures</H1><P CLASS="t">An <I>event</I> in Microsoft Excel is the occurrence of an action such as opening a workbook, switching to a sheet, using a particular key combination, or recalculating a worksheet. Some events are initiated by the user; others are initiated by Microsoft Excel or by other applications. By assigning procedures to events, you can enhance or alter the way users interact with your application.</P>
<P CLASS="t">There are three main classes of event-driven procedures, organized by the way you associate the procedure with the event:</P>
<UL><LI>You can associate a procedure with the action of clicking a button or other object; you do this by using the Assign Macro command on the Tools menu, as discussed in the preceding chapters.</LI><LI>You can associate a procedure with one of a specfic set of workbook-level and worksheet-level events by giving the procedure a special automatic procedure name that begins with "Auto_".</LI><LI>You can associate a procedure with a defined event for an object by setting an OnEvent property of the object (such as the <B>OnWindow</B> or <B>OnCalculate</B> property) to the procedure name.</LI></UL><P></P>
