<H1>Installing and Registering Object Libraries</H1><P CLASS="t">If you cannot find the locale you want to use listed in the Language/Country box on the Module General tab in the Options dialog box (Tools menu), you must install and register the corresponding object libraries. Visual Basic in Microsoft Excel requires two object library files for each language: the Microsoft Excel object library and the Visual Basic for applications object library.</P>
<P CLASS="t">For specific information about the names of the object library files and how you acquire the files, see the appropriate Help topics.</P>
<P CLASS="proch"><B><img src="prcarrow.gif">    To install object libraries</B></P>
<P CLASS="lt1"> <UL><LI>For each language you want to work with, copy the Microsoft Excel object library files to your Microsoft Excel program folder, and copy the Visual Basic object library files to your Windows system folder (or your System32 folder if you're using the Windows NT&trade; operating system). For a complete list of object library names, see "Names of the Object Library Files" later in this appendix.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">If someone gives you an application written in another language and includes the object library files, those files are registered automatically when you try to run any of the procedures in the application. However, if you write code and use the object libraries for the first time, you must register them with Microsoft Excel yourself. <I>Registering</I> files means making Microsoft Excel aware that they exist. You only have to register an object library once, unless you move or rename one or both files.</P>
<P CLASS="proch"><B><img src="prcarrow.gif">    To register a new language version of the object library files</B></P>
<P CLASS="ls">    1.    Switch to a Visual Basic module.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">    2.    On the Tools menu, click References.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">    3.    Click Browse.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">    4.    In the Look In box, click the name of the folder that contains the new Microsoft Excel object library file.</P>
<P CLASS="ls">    5.    Double-click the object library filename.</P>
<P CLASS="lt1">(Repeat steps 3 through 5 for the Visual Basic object library file.)</P>
<P CLASS="ls">    6.    Click OK to close the References dialog box.</P>
<P></P>
<P CLASS="t">You can now click Options on the Tools menu, click the Module General tab, and select the locale you want.</P>
<P CLASS="t">If the language you want still isn't available, Microsoft Excel has already assigned a language to your workbook. You should open a new workbook and repeat the preceding steps. Remember, you can assign a language to a workbook only once, as explained in "Working in Multiple Locales" earlier in this appendix.</P>
