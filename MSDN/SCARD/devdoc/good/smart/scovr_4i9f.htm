<h2><a name="_smart_smart_card_readers"></a>Smart Card Readers</h2>
<p>
Readers are standard devices within the <a href="scgloss_7mwj.htm#_smart_smart_card_subsystem_gly">smart card subsystem</a>. They are controlled through drivers, and are introduced to and removed from the system through Plug and Play or through the control panel Devices applet.</p>
<p>
Each reader must be defined for use by the smart card subsystem. The subsystem is not responsible for any reader not specifically given to it.</p>
<p>
Smart card readers can be divided into logical groups called reader groups. These groups can be defined by the subsystem, as well as defined by administrators and users. A reader can belong to more than one reader group</p>
<p>
The smart card subsystem defines the following groups.
<dl>
<dt>
SCard$AllReaders </dt>
<dd>
This group contains all the readers in the system. A new reader given to the smart card subsystem is automatically included in the system-wide reader group, SCard$AllReaders. </dd>
<dt>
SCard$DefaultReaders</dt>
<dd>
This default group, one for each terminal, contains all the readers assigned to the terminal that are not reserved for specific use.
</dd>
</dl>
