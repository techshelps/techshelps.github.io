<h2><a name="_smart_introducing_smart_cards_to_the_system"></a>Introducing Smart Cards to the System</h2>
<p>
Before the smart card subsystem can find a smart card, the smart card must be introduced to the system. This is typically done with a smart card setup utility provided by the card manufacturer. The utility could come as a program on a floppy disk (with the smart card), an ActiveX control available on a web site, and so on.</p>
<p>
The setup utility must provide the following pieces of information about the card:
<ul>
<li>
Its <a href="scgloss_7mw1.htm#_smart_atr_string_gly">ATR string</a>, and an optional mask to use as an aid in identifying the card.</li>
<li>
A list of smart card interfaces supported by the card.</li>
<li>
A friendly name for the card, to be used in identifying the card to the user. In most cases, the user will supply this to the setup utility.</li>
<li>
The <a href="scgloss_7mwg.htm#_smart_primary_service_provider_gly">primary service provider</a> associated with the card (optional), to be used when accessing the card through COM interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To simplify setup utilities, and to ensure the integrity of the <a href="scgloss_7mwj.htm#_smart_smart_card_database_gly">smart card database</a>, the smart card subsystem provides the following two functions. <a href="smartfun_8s4l.htm"><b>SCardIntroduceCardType</b></a><b> </b>introduces a smart card into the database and <a href="smartfun_7td1.htm"><b>SCardForgetCardType</b></a><b> </b>removes it from the database.</p>
