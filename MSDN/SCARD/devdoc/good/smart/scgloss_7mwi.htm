<dt>
<a name="_smart_reader_gly"></a><b>reader</b></dt>
<dd>
A standard device within the smart card subsystem. An interface device (IFD) that supports bi-directional input/output to a smart card. It may be associated with an entire system, one or more reader groups, or with a specific terminal.
<p>
The smart card subsystem allows a reader to be dedicated to the terminal to which it is assigned. However, currently only one terminal exists on a computer. Microsoft® Windows NT® may eventually support multiple processes on multiple terminals.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_smart_reader_driver_gly"></a><b>reader driver</b></dt>
<dd>
A specific driver that maps driver services to a specific hardware reader device. It must communicate card insertion and removal events to the smart card class driver for forwarding to the smart card resource manager, and provide data exchange capabilities to the card by any raw, T=0, T=1, or PTS protocol.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_smart_reader_group_gly"></a><b>reader group</b></dt>
<dd>
A logical group of readers. Reader groups can be defined by the system or created by users or administrators. Reader groups are used by smart card functions that can act upon groups of readers.
<p>
To avoid naming collisions with user-defined groups, Microsoft reserves the use of any name containing the $ symbol.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_smart_reader_helper_driver_gly"></a><b>reader helper driver</b></dt>
<dd>
Provides common smart card driver support routines and additional T=0 and T=1 protocol support to specific drivers as needed.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_smart_reply_apdu_gly"></a><b>reply APDU</b></dt>
<dd>
An APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit) sent in reply to a received APDU.
<p>
See also: <a href="scgloss_7mw1.htm#_smart_apdu_gly">APDU</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_smart_resource_manager_gly"></a><b>resource manager</b></dt>
<dd>
The component of the smart card subsystem  that manages access to multiple readers and smart cards.
<p>
The resource manager identifies and tracks resources, allocates readers and resources across multiple applications, and supports transaction primitives for accessing services available on a given card.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_smart_resource_manager_api_gly"></a><b>resource manager API</b></dt>
<dd>
A set of Win32® functions that provide direct access to the resource manager's services.</dd>
<dt>
<a name="_smart_resource_manager_context_gly"></a><b>resource manager context</b></dt>
<dd>
The context used by the resource manager when accessing the smart card database. The resource manager context is primarily used by the query and management functions when accessing the database.
<p>
The scope of the resource manager context can be the current user or the system.
</dd>
