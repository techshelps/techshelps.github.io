<p>
When you access a document using the Internet Transfer Control via <i>OpenURL</i>, after the call has been made the URL that has been supplied as the first parameter is parsed and the various components of the URL are stored in the corresponding properties of the Internet Transfer Control. This feature is a nice time-saver because you can display the various elements of the URL as separate entities without having to parse the URL yourself. The component parts can then easily be assigned to variables or displayed in form controls.</p>
<p>
Likewise, it is possible to create a URL string by assigning the various sub properties the required values. The URL property will then contain the complete concatenated URL.</p>
<p>
The properties that contain the various properties of the URL are <i>Protocol</i>, <i>RemoteHost</i>, and <i>Document</i>.</p>
<p>
All of the preceding properties are read/write, but they will be modified by an <i>OpenURL </i>operation to reflect the components of the new URL. Sometimes what you supply as a URL will actually be changed by the server. In the case of the HTTP protocol, sometimes the server will automatically jump you from the location of one HTML document to another. (Maybe a file location has changed, and the Web server includes an automatic link to the new file.) In this case, the URL that is returned in the URL <i>RemoteHost </i>and <i>Document </i>properties will be different from the one that you supplied to the <i>OpenURL </i>method. Watch out for this potential “gotcha” in your applications.</p>
