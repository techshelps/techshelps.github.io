<p>
BCP is a DB-Library utility for copying large amounts of data into or out of SQL Server. BCP is used primarily for copying data from a SQL server for use with other programs (or spreadsheets), to upload data files from different databases, and to copy information from one SQL server to another SQL server. It provides a bulk-copy API that is guaranteed to be quicker than any other method for inserting records into SQL Server database tables.</p>
<p>
The normal method of inserting a row into a table in a data source is to execute an INSERT SQL query. This is fine for the normal day-to-day activities that are part of any database application. The DBMS will ensure that the data that is inserted is of the correct types for the fields and will update indexes and enforce referential integrity constraints as well as run triggers that might be attached to the table or fields. Unfortunately, this can make the process of inserting a record slow. I should say here that this “slowness” is relative; most Insert queries will execute in a fraction of a second. The difference between executing 10 inserts per second and 100 inserts per second isn’t something that would usually affect most applications; however, when you’re importing a large number of records, this difference could grow from minutes to hours.</p>
