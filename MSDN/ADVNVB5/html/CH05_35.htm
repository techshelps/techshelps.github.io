<p>
Don’t get sidetracked by irrelevant machine-specific details. Almost all the time, we want to deal with numbers. For example, consider your thought process when you choose between declaring a variable to be of type integer or type long. You might consider what the likely values of the variable are going to be, worry a little bit about the effect on performance or memory usage, and maybe check to see how you declared a similar variable somewhere else so that you can be consistent. Save time. Get into the habit of declaring all these variables as Variants.</p>
<p class=indent>
<span class=blue><b>Note</b></span>  All variables in my code are either Variants or references to classes. Consequently, a lot of code starts to look like this:</p>
<p class=indent>
<code>Dim Top    As Variant<br>
Dim Left   As Variant<br>
Dim Width  As Variant<br>
Dim Height As Variant</code></p>
<p class=indent>
After a time, I started to take advantage of the fact that Variants are the default, so my code now typically looks like this:</p>
<p class=indent>
<code>Dim Top, Left, Width, Height</code></p>
<p class=indent>
I see no problem with this, but your current Visual Basic coding standards will more than likely prohibit it. You might think about changing them.</p>
