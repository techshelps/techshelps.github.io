<i>Everyone has talent. What is rare is the courage to follow the talent to the dark place where it leads.</i></p>

Those who really care about quality and want to do a good job are often considered mavericks by the organization they work for. They don’t fit in, they don’t play the political game, and they don’t strive to move into the management hierarchy.</p>
<p>
Staff who argue their points, don’t accept decisions at face value, and insist on doing things the right way can be difficult to manage. They can be a thorn in the manager’s side. They might insist on being paid more than their manager. They do build better systems, though; they build systems that are maintainable, meet business needs, and are less costly. They <i>are </i>probably worth more than their manager.</p>
