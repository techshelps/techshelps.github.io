<p>
All major version changes should follow an announcement to the users regarding the changes in functionality, features, and user interface. You might not consider that changes to date data input fields warrant a major version change; however, just wait until your date field input validation fails on the users and they don’t know why! Ensure that the users are aware of the changes to the system, especially the user interface changes.</p>
<p>
Of course, it’s possible that no user interface elements have changed, including date data input fields. If this is the case, the implementation should be transparent from the user’s perspective—perhaps a formal announcement isn’t warranted. It’s my guess, however, that the whole Year 2000 issue will gain much more media attention in the near future, and you might consider it important to assure your users that their software is now Year 2000 compliant.</p>
