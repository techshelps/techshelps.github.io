<p>
In a remarkably short time and with the application of only a few techniques, we’ve managed to create a working generic CBT system. Once you understand the principles, you can apply the same techniques to the builder and the presenter so that the actual development requirement is kept to a minimum. In reality, this can be considered only as a prototype system, but the majority of the work required to make it a fully commercial application will revolve around how the interfaces for the builder and, more important, the presenter will work. There have been a few pointers as we looked at the code for the project, and I’m sure that you can now take the project and turn it into a useful application for your company.</p>
