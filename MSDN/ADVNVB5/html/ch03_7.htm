<p>
One of the key areas of concern I have with custom development is the trend toward overengineered solutions. There’s no point in developing complex reports unless you have to. If your user is happy with a fixed-format report and doesn’t continually request changes, you should just leave the standard report as is.</p>
<p>
The need for advanced reporting is driven by the nature of the requirement and the user’s work environment. A user who produces a stock list once a month for internal viewing has a fixed, well-defined report requirement. In contrast, a user in the same company who provides ad hoc marketing information to external clients, the CEO, and other managers is unlikely to be able to pin down the requirements to one set of reports.</p>
<p>
An example of a traditional report requirement is an application that generates payroll checks. The report that produces the check has fixed data content, report format, and report layout. The report requirement probably won’t change over time, and you’d certainly not make it possible for your users to edit the end result. In direct contrast, an advanced report would be required to generate quoted company details (company information with relevant stock prices and stock levels) published in a range of formats from within Microsoft Excel, Word, and Microsoft Internet Explorer without forcing a user to cut and paste information from each separate application.</p>
