As I’ve already said, C2 compiles each component to an object file. When all the components are compiled, they are linked using LINK.EXE. Table 8-3 on page 332, which is based on the Visual C++ online help, lists the command-line arguments you might find in a typical run when creating an EXE containing a single form, class, and module. The only native code option switched on for this run was Create Symbolic Debug Info. This information was captured using the OUTARGS program.</p>
<p>
Again, LINK.EXE is taken from the Visual C++ 4.2 compiler. At the time of writing, its version number was 4.20.6164—exactly the same version as that supplied with Visual C++ 4.2. See the Visual C++ documentation or MSDN for more information about these linker switches.</p>
