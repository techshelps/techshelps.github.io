<p>
As with <i>DateAdd</i>, the <i>DateDiff </i>function is used widely in Visual Basic to perform arithmetic on dates. The <i>DateDiff </i>function will return the number of time intervals between two given dates.</p>
<p>
<b>Return value</b>  The return value for the <i>DateDiff </i>function is the number of specified time intervals between the two given dates. This function always returns a number.</p>
<p>
<b>Arguments</b>  Visual Basic 4 and 5 have some extra “first day of the week” type arguments that are not relevant to the Y2K topic. The main arguments of the <i>DateDiff </i>function are <i>interval</i>, which is the time period in question (that is, day, month, year, and so on), and <i>date1</i> and <i>date2</i>, which are the two dates being compared. So for example, the following code will display the number 1, indicating that given December 24, there is only one day remaining until Christmas Day:</p>
<pre><code>MsgBox "Days until Xmas = " &amp; DateDiff("d", "12/24", "12/25")</code></pre>
<p>
Again, notice that I omitted the year part of the date to demonstrate how Visual Basic will assume the current year.</p>
<p>
<b>Y2K issues</b>  Yep, you guessed it! <i>DateDiff </i>in Visual Basic 3 and 4 doesn’t like date expressions formatted as short dates. The following code example tells me that there are 36,523 days between December 31, 1999, and January 1, 2000, instead of the one day that I would have expected. Admittedly, I didn’t enter four-digit years; but your users probably won’t either!</p>
<pre><code>Msgbox "Difference = " &amp; DateDiff("d", "1/1/0", "31/12/99")</code></pre>
