<p>
Because the Internet is open to all sorts of nefarious cyber lowlifes, security is often an issue when connecting to an Internet server. The most common form of security involves supplying a user name and valid password to the server. The <i>UserName </i>property and the <i>Password</i> property are used to supply a user name and password to a remote server that requires such information.</p>
<p>
Most public HTTP sites don’t have any security limitations, so these two properties can be left blank for most HTTP operations. FTP servers, however, nearly always require you to log on. Public FTP servers allow an anonymous logon, in which the user name is “anonymous” and the password is the user’s e-mail address.</p>
<p>
The Internet Transfer control provides default values for these properties. In most cases, these default values are all you will require to access an Internet server. However, if the server does require a specific password or the default values do not work, you can manually set these properties to allow you to log on.</p>
