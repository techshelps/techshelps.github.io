<p>
Why does the use of classes in your Visual Basic code help make your code more reusable and extensible? What advantages do classes have over traditional BAS files, functions, variables, and so on?</p>
<p>
Classes provide the framework for clearly defining and separating what is on the <i>inside</i> and the <i>outside</i>. The outside of any class is its interface. This is the contract that your class promises to abide by, and the code that utilizes your class can rely on that interface being present.</p>
<p>
From the point of view of the Class Builder, the interface also lets <i>you</i> know what your clients are relying on. So provided that you keep the interface in place, you can extend the class without breaking any existing code. It’s quite simple.</p>
