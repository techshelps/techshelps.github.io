<p>
While <i>OpenURL </i>provides a simple interface, it is limited in a number of ways, as mentioned previously. The <i>Execute </i>method of the Internet Transfer Control provides the developer with an enhanced programming model for control of Internet file transfers. The <i>Execute </i>method’s main strengths are that it executes asynchronously and that it allows files to be transmitted as well as received.</p>
<p>
Asynchronous communication means that once a transfer has been initiated, program execution returns to the calling code. This provides a number of major advantages. First, it allows an easy way to manage and monitor large transfers (or small transfers over a slow connection). Transfer progress can be tracked and displayed, partial contents of files can be retrieved, and transfers can be interrupted at the user’s request.</p>
<p>
Second, the <i>Execute </i>method provides the ability to fully exploit the features of a particular server. FTP servers provide a complete set of commands that can be used not only to send and receive files but also to manage the file structure of the remote service. HTTP servers allow headers, or summary information, about particular documents to be retrieved.</p>
<p>
Third, although the <i>Execute </i>method is more complex to use than <i>OpenURL</i>, it provides much better capabilities for exploiting the full potential of the Internet. <i>OpenURL </i>provides you with the ability to retrieve a file—that’s all. <i>Execute </i>opens your applications to smart ways of operating. Whether you’re automatically posting new documents to Web servers or administering a remote FTP server, there is not much in the way of information transfer that the Internet Transfer Control does not let you do.</p>
<p>
In the IntSales example, there was no way to determine whether the MyCompany staff already had the most current copy of the relevant price list. Using the <i>Execute </i>method would have allowed them to use the capabilities of an FTP server to check the time stamp of a file and decide whether they really needed to download the latest copy of the file, thus saving valuable Internet connect time.</p>
