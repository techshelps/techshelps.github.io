<p>
The first task of the analysis stage should be to create an issues list. To begin with, this list can be a huge pot containing all unknown entities. Try to make the issues list a global, dynamic document so that anybody and everybody can add issues, questions, and observations to it at will. No matter how hard you try, you’ll probably never think of every possible Year 2000–related issue, but the people doing the actual work will be aware of various situations and scenarios that you might never have thought of. The best way to get the ball rolling is to create the issues list yourself and then make it public. As time goes by, you can resolve or delete certain issues or convert issues to tasks.</p>
