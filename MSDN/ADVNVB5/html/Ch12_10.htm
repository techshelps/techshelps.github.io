For each database on the SQL Server, there is a list of people who are allowed to use the database—the database users. Each login record maps to a user name in databases to which they are allowed access. The simplest scenario is that a login record for User B is matched by a user record for User B in the accounts database. Thus, User B can log into SQL Server and have access to the accounts database. Although the user name doesn’t have to be the same as the login name, it greatly simplifies things if they are the same.</p>
