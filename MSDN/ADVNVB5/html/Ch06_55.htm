<p>
After Office 95 is loaded, a shortcut to the old Word templates is created in the templates directory of the Office 95 root directory. If the old version of Office is then removed, this shortcut becomes invalid and causes problems with creating new documents. To rectify this problem, simply delete the shortcut from the templates directory.</p>
<p>
When you set visible properties of toolbars via Automation, the Not Visible value in Office 4.3 maps to the Visible value in Office 95, turning off all the toolbars in Office 4.3 and turning on all the toolbars in Office 95.</p>
<p>
When you change from 16-bit versions of Word to 32-bit versions of Word, the caption displayed in the title bar has changed to include the word <i>Microsoft </i>and to exclude the filename extension. Take care to ensure that ported programs do not try to locate an instance of Word using the <i>FindWindow </i>API call with the wrong title string.</p>

<span class=blue><b>Tip </b></span> You need to consider the Automation incompatibility issue for your legacy applications that are not being ported to Visual Basic 5 if you want your users to start using either Windows NT 4 or Windows 95. They might be using Office 3.<i>x</i>, Office 95, or Office 97.</p>
