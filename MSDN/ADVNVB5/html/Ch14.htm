<b>MARK HURST </b></p>
<p>
Mark is a TMS Associate who is also a writer, painter, pilot, filmmaker, and enthusiastic, if only mildly talented, ragtime guitarist. He risks life and limb daily by charging through London traffic on a gigantic Yamaha trail bike, and he almost never wears a tie. Since graduating with a computer science degree in 1985, Mark has made a living out of software. Mark is an accomplished C, C++, and Pascal programmer, and he has also worked as a designer, analyst, system tester, configuration manager, and trainer. He has worked with Visual Basic since the 2.0 beta program and is a Microsoft Certified Professional. Mark has presented at VBITS and the Visual Tools Developers’ Academy and has published many articles in industry journals and beyond. </p>
