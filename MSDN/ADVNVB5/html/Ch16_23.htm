<p>
The business analysis/project management team consists of people who are specialists in particular areas of the business. A business analyst/project manager is responsible for a project from start to finish, including both technical and user-related tasks (such as user training). These teams have a lot of user interaction and might receive project and enhancement requests from the users. They manage the requirements specification and prototyping. After the solution team has built the system, they are responsible for performing acceptance testing along with the users before passing the system on for implementation.</p>
