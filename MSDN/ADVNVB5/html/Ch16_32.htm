<p>
It’s all very well to live in an esoteric consulting world of process and structure, but how does one get started on a real-live project? At TMS, we feel that the best way to begin is to define a target process and structure for the organization and to evolve toward this off the back of a pilot, or Pathfinder, project. On balance, the Pathfinder approach is better than attempting to set up the new process and structure prior to the first project. And of course, it’s essential to have the right people with the right skills.</p>
