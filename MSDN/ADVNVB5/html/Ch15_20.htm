<p>
Because of their dual nature, controls present unique licensing issues in both design-time and run-time environments. Two main issues are associated with creating and distributing ActiveX DLLs. The first involves licensing your own control. Microsoft has made this deliriously easy. Just display the Properties dialog box for your ActiveX Control project, and check the Require License Key check box, at the foot of the General tab. This creates a license key that is placed in the system Registry when your ActiveX control is installed. This key enables the control to be used within the development environment and to be included in a project. When the project is distributed, however, the key is encoded in the executable and not added to the Registry of the target machine. This prevents the control from being used within the design-time environment on that machine. Visual Basic does it all for you!</p>
<p>
The second licensing issue surrounds the use of third-party controls embedded within your own control. When you compile your control, the license keys of any constituent third-party controls are not encoded in your control. Additionally, when your control is installed on another machine, the license key for your control will be added to the Registry, but the license keys of any of these contained controls are not. So although your control might have been installed correctly, it won’t work unless the controls it contains are separately licensed to work on the target machine.</p>
<p>
If you’re writing for an in-house development, licensing will be largely irrele-vant. For those writing controls for a third-party product or as part of a commercial product, however, licensing is an important issue. You need to be able to protect your copyright, and fortunately you have been given the means to do so.</p>
