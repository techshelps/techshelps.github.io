<p>
Now that we have looked at multimedia, at MDI, and at how to create the same effect in SDI, there’s no real reason why we should not also step away from the traditional-looking Windows interface to something that is a little more intuitive to use and more user-friendly. To help out the user, we can still create context-sensitive multimedia help and have a fallback position of the Windows help system, but now we can be more creative in our approach to the user interface. The basis for building and activating this user interface is the concept of the hot spot, which is a region on the screen that detects mouse operations and then acts accordingly. The elements that we require are the user interface design, the hot spots, and the actions associated with the hot spots.</p>
