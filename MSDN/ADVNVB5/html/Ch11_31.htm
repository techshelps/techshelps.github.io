The first enhancement that you might want to make is in the area of screen navigation. To keep the model simple, I’ve allowed for a form to have only a single entry and exit. In a real-world application, this would be a many-to-many relationship to allow the presenter to show the end user the navigation routes through the system. To do this here would have added substantially to the complexity and the amount of code without showing any useful multimedia techniques. I’m sure that you’ll have no trouble extending the system in this area.</p>

As with the irregular hot spot project, there is a blank database called CbtBlank.mdb, which you can use to create new databases. The details are set up on the database using the builder application that you will find on the CD as CbtBuilder.vbp. The CBT database is shown in Figure 11-8.</p>
