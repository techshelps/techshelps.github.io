<p>
Complete sample applications and code used in this book are provided on the companion CD located at the back of the book. The files for the sample programs are contained in the CD’s SAMPLES folder. They are organized according to the chapter in the book in which they are discussed. (For example, Chapter 1 samples are located in the \SAMPLES\CHAP01 folder.) You can browse these files on the CD, or you can install them on your hard drive. Installing them requires approximately 12 MB of disk space.</p>
<p>
To install the sample files on your hard drive, place the CD in your CD-ROM drive and follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>
Click on the CD-ROM drive in Windows Explorer.<br><br></li>
<li>
Double-click SETUP.EXE in the root directory of the CD.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<i>or</i>
<ol>
<li>
Select Run from the Start menu.<br><br></li>
<li>
Type <i>d:\setup</i> in the Run dialog box (where <i>d</i> is the drive letter of your CD drive).<p class=indent>
<b>Note</b>   If you try to browse the files on the CD without installing them and you’re unable to read some of the files, your CD driver software probably doesn’t support long filenames. If this is the case, you must run the setup program to install the sample files in order to browse them.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
To uninstall the sample files, do the following:
<ol>
<li>
Open the Control Panel, and select Add/Remove Programs.<br><br></li>
<li>
On the Install/Uninstall tab, select Advanced Visual Basic 5.<br><br></li>
<li>
Click Add/Remove.<br><br></li>
<li>
Click Yes when prompted.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you have trouble running any of the sample files, review the text in the appropriate chapter in the book. You can also refer to the README.TXT file in the root directory of the CD, and some of the chapter subfolders also have their own README.TXT files.</p>
<p>
Also contained on the CD is an AVI file you can run from the CD to find out more about the authors and The Mandelbrot Set (International) Limited.</p>
