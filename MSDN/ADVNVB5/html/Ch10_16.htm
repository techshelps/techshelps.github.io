<p>
This is an obvious point, but I mention it for completeness. If you are responsible for testing a system, it is vital that you understand the nature and meaning of whatever test data you are feeding to it. This is one area in which I have noticed that extra effort is required to coax the users into providing the necessary information. They are normally busy people, and once they know that their urgently needed new system is actually being developed, their priorities tend to revert to their everyday duties. Therefore, when you ask for suitable test data for the system, it should be given to you in a documented form that is a clearly defined set of data to feed in. This pack of test data should also include an expected set of results to be achieved. This data should be enough to cover the various stages of testing (unit, integration, and system) for which the development team is responsible. You can bet that when the users start user acceptance testing, they will have a set of test data ready for themselves, so why shouldn’t they have a set ready for you? Coax them, cajole them, threaten them, raise it in meetings, and get it documented, but make sure you get that data. I realize that if you are also the developer (or one of them), you might know enough about the system to be able to create your own test data on their behalf, but the testing process should not make allowances for any assumptions. Testing is a checking process, and it is there to verify that you have understood the finer points of the design document. If you provide your own test data, the meaning of the test might be lost.</p>
