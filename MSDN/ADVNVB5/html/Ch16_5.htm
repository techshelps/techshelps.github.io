<p>
The business world that our systems support is generally becoming more volatile and is demanding new systems of greater complexity in shorter time frames. We need to develop systems in the context of a corporate business systems architecture that allows rapidly developed systems to integrate and form a basis for future change and development. Systems such as this will help us manage the problems that occur when rapid development approaches are applied to large projects.</p>
