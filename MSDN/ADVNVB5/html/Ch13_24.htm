<p>
Using RDO cuts out the Jet layer from the architecture. This can mean significantly higher performance and more flexibility when accessing remote database engines. It’s possible to use any ODBC data source with RDO and the RemoteData control; therefore, it’s still possible to use desktop databases that have ODBC drivers (for example, Access databases). However, these features are really designed to take advantage of database servers such as SQL Server and Oracle, which use sophisticated query engines. Using RDO with desktop databases that have ODBC drivers, such as Access, can actually <i>decrease </i>performance dramatically.</p>
<p>
If you use RDO, you can create either simple cursorless resultsets or more complex cursors. You can also run queries that will return any number of resultsets or will execute stored procedures that return resultsets with or without output parameters and return values. You can limit the number of rows returned and monitor all of the messages and errors generated by the remote data source without compromising the executing query. RDO also permits either synchronous or asynchronous operation, so your application doesn’t need to be blocked while lengthy queries are executed.</p>
<p>
Be aware that RDO and the RemoteData control are features of Visual Basic 5, Enterprise and Professional Editions. You can’t develop code using the RDO object library or RemoteData control in the Standard Edition of Visual Basic 5.</p>
