<p>
I contend that there is a strong likelihood that systems built using these methods will suffer from the aforementioned DDS. Notwithstanding Jennifer Stapleton’s (Jennifer Stapleton is chairman of the DSDM Consortium’s technical work group) assertions that DSDM, for instance, has a strong quality focus, I believe that while such projects might have appropriate regard for the quality of the individual deliverables, the quality of the overall system might well be neglected by the emphasis on iterative delivery of parts of the functionality within short schedules.</p>
<p>
Any such design or quality deficiency might not be evident, or at least might not be readily observed within the individual components of a systems solution, but might be manifest in the behavior of the system in production. For these reasons, I make the following recommendations:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Follow these approaches only where the deliverable system is not <br>
required to scale far to achieve production status and volumes.<br><br></li>
<li>
Maintain the small-team ethos where such methods are used. I don’t believe that the methods themselves scale to large projects (30 or more project members). As I have already implied, much of the success of rapid methods comes from the team members being selected from the very best.<br><br></li>
<li>
Question the suitability of the method before undertaking systems with high processing complexity relative to their interface requirements. The feedback demands made by short iterative feedback cycles are difficult to partition in such systems.<br><br></li>
<li>
Make sure that the controlling bodies of these methods look very carefully at the purposes for which these techniques were originated and try to mirror the original set of motives.<br><br></li>
<li>
Do your part to ensure that our industry begins to recognize the true value of design and encourages design excellence and the provision of training for this sadly overlooked discipline.</li>
