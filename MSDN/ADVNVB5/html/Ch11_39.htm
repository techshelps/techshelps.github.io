<p>
This was a real roller-coaster ride through multimedia. It’s a bit like a stone bouncing on the water. We’ve touched down in a few places, mostly skimming the surface, but there’s still a whole ocean to explore. We’ve managed to cover enough material for a complete book, so by necessity we’ve concentrated on the techniques, rather than on production of reams of code. I hope that it’s given you some ideas and that you no longer look on multimedia as just bells and whistles that are difficult to implement in an application. I also hope that before you leap into your next application, you at least consider the style of interface that should be used (although I do appreciate that at many sites, rigorous standards are applied). Just maybe you have enough information to question some of these now and show how a little customization of the interface can produce real benefits to your organization.</p>
<p>
I would have loved to have covered many of the topics in more depth, but it just wasn’t possible. You do have a starting point for finding out more and extending the work that we’ve done in this chapter. As with most things, the best way to learn is to do, so have at it.</p>
