<p>
With the release of Visual Basic 5, Microsoft has included an ActiveX control that makes developing applications for communicating with Internet servers an achievable task for Visual Basic mortals. The Internet Transfer Control provides support for accessing both FTP and HTTP servers. The HTTP protocol lets you connect to World Wide Web servers and retrieve HTML files. The FTP protocol lets you send any kind of files to and receive any kind of files from an Internet FTP server.</p>
<p>
The Internet Transfer Control is actually an OLE interface to an underlying Windows dynamic-link library (DLL) named WININET.DLL. This DLL is part of the Win32 Application Programming Interface (API) specification. This makes the Internet Transfer Control an interface to a core part of the Windows architecture, which might be reassuring to those concerned about the shelf life of the components with which they choose to develop.</p>
<p>
Previously, developing Internet-based applications involved a tortuous descent into the arcane and complex world of TCP/IP, Windows Sockets, and esoteric C source code. With the inclusion of the Internet Transfer Control in Visual Basic 5, this is no longer the case.</p>
