So just what is a business object? Here are some definitions:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
An intellectual entity made manifest<br><br></li>
<li>
A real-world object reduced to bits and bytes<br><br></li>
<li>
A body where flesh is data and methods are its bones<br><br></li>
<li>
A template for things of a particular type<br><br></li>
<li>
An encapsulation of functionality and data capable of having identity</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you’re in the car rental business, a business object might be a car or a contract; if you work in a bank, a customer and an account would certainly be two of your primary business objects. These business objects are full of business rules, rules that basically govern the way a business is run. The rules are usually represented in code as <i>Case </i>statements or nested <i>If</i>s<i> </i>that allow or disallow actions, modify elements, or perform methods differently depending on state.</p>
