<p>
Changes in DAO can be dealt with in the short term by using the DAO compatibility layer that recognizes methods such as <i>CreateDynaset</i> and maps them to the appropriate new methods such as <i>OpenRecordSet</i>. The DAO compatibility layer is automatically added to a project that uses DAO when it is first imported into Visual Basic 5. If it is not in your project, however, you can add it from the References dialog box. This will get your program working without any major changes to the code, but once you move it, you can ease future development if you rewrite the few areas affected. Generally, this involves a one-line change for each place where a recordset is created. See Appendix B for a list of old and new methods.</p>
