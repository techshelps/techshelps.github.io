<p>
With your users running your Visual Basic 3 application under Windows 3.<i>x</i>, if you are using Microsoft Office Components as Automation servers to provide output you know which version of Office you are using. As soon as your users move to the 32-bit operating systems, they could be using 16-bit versions of Microsoft Office, Microsoft Office 95, or Microsoft Office 97. Although the differences among these programs acting as Automation servers are small, they might cause problems for programs that have not been built to expect the changes.</p>
