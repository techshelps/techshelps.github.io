<p>
Once you’ve written your code, you should profile it. When optimizing code, you must make sure that you optimize the right bit—not just the slow stuff but the frequently used slow stuff! A <i>profiler</i> is a tool that is used to time code. An <i>execution profile</i> is the result of running such a tool. You can use the output of the profiler to identify where execution time is being spent. If you’re already using Visual Basic 4, you should know that VBCP is the name given to the Visual Basic Code Profiler add-in. The VBCP is also included with Visual Basic 5 and is an extremely powerful tool that helps you track down important and frequently hit slow code.</p>
