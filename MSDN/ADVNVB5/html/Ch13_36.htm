<h1><a name="oledb"></a>OLE DB</h1>
<p>
OLE DB is the latest data access technology and, as such, deserves some attention when you’re deciding on a data access method for your application. In fact, the technology is so new that few people have, at the time of this writing, used it. The basic philosophy that underpins OLE DB is Microsoft’s quest for the holy grail: “information at your fingertips.” So far, this quest has led to integrated applications suites (such as Microsoft Office) that are able to share data in a way that improves much on previous generations of software. It has also led to the development of standard APIs, such as ODBC, that provide transparent access to a multiplicity of databases. However, there are more data stores that contain unstructured (or non-DBMS) data than there are those that contain structured data. By data store it would be fair to say that I mean <i>any</i> file stored on your computer hard disk or network, such as project plans, e-mail, and bulletin boards. Until now, there has been no single way to integrate this data. OLE DB provides the way to access these diverse data sources.</p>
<p>
OLE DB is a set of OLE interfaces that provides applications with uniform access to data stored in diverse information sources. These interfaces support the specific amount of DBMS functionality appropriate to the data source, enabling the data source to share its data.</p>
