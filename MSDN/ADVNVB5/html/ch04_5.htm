<p>
A Web browser, in its simplest terms, is any program that implements Web client protocols. This client application enables the client computer to gain access to a Web server or other Internet Services such as FTP. From a user perspective, this is the true window on the World Wide Web. It interprets and displays Web pages. Soon the browser will be in an integrated environment in which applications such as electronic mail systems use Web protocols to access database servers that also happen to implement Web protocols. Hence, it will be the protocols that both determine and limit what can be done on the Web.</p>
<p>
Figure 4-1 shows just how these protocols fit together.</p>

When is the Internet not the Internet? When it is an intranet. (Well, at least it isn’t another acronym.) The term “intranet” is widely used to describe the application of Internet technologies in internal corporate networks. Businesses are using intranets today to share information more effectively and as a vehicle to integrate their existing infrastructure and legacy systems, thus taking advantage of the Internet browser paradigm. Intranets are based on technology that already exists in many enterprises. To access an intranet, at a minimum you’ll need to install TCP/IP and a Web browser on the client computer and have a Web server. A connection to the Internet is helpful as well.</p>
<p>
Transaction-oriented business applications are the lifeblood of businesses. The corporate intranet offers great potential for adding value to and extending the reach of legacy systems and permits new ways of creating, presenting, searching, and managing that key corporate asset called information. It is not surprising, therefore, to see the swarm of activity from vendors to provide both client and server support in their product offerings.</p>
<p>
Because intranets and the Internet are so closely related, you need to consider how they interact and how they are typically utilized. The framework put in place should divide the business use of networks between internal (intranet) and external (Internet), and between informative and transactional use.</p>
