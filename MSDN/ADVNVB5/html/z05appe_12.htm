<p>
We have all seen systems so difficult or frustrating to use that users avoid them at every opportunity. We have all worked with systems whose user interfaces make it difficult to do what we want to do; most of us work with such software daily. Some of the best-selling software in the world today has this problem.</p>
<p>
The manner in which this aspect of systems behavior has been systematically overlooked should be a source of daily shame to the computing profession. I still hear professionals intoning the familiar mantra that anyone can design a user interface. It isn’t true. It’s never been true. It’s less true in the age of GUIs than it’s ever been.</p>
<p>
The World Wide Web offends in an entirely novel fashion with respect to interface and usability design. Much of the Web has been designed by graphics artists, and while these people have highly developed visual senses and personally based aesthetics, those talents do not contribute significantly toward the goal of usability in information-based computer systems. We are now discovering that the obverse of the computer systems developers’ obsession with function over form—the graphic designers’ preference for form over function—delivers systems every bit as unusable.</p>
