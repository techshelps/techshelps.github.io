Our sincere thanks to the following people:</p>

The entire TMS authoring team. You sacrificed much personal time and effort to deliver high-quality work under tight deadlines.</p>
<p>
The rest of TMS for supporting, and putting up with, the authoring team!</p>
<p>
Jim Brown, Steve Guty, Sally Stickney, Jean Ross, Ron Lamb, Jim Fuchs, Bill (just call me Zephan) Teel, and everyone else at Microsoft Press (you know who you are) for getting such a high-quality job done.</p>
<p>
From the Visual Basic team, Scott Swanson for suggesting to Microsoft Press that these Brits were the guys to do the book, and everyone else who has supported us. What a truly great product you’ve made—well done.</p>
