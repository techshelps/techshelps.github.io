<p>
The <i>Execute </i>method provides a powerful way to move information across the Internet. What else is there that you could achieve with the <i>Execute </i>command and, more important, the Internet Transfer Control in general?</p>
<p>
The examples in this chapter have focused mainly on FTP servers because these are still the most common servers in use today for transferring files. HTTP servers with the ability to send and retrieve not only the files but summary information about these files provide features that you can use to build more advanced applications based on these servers.</p>
<p>
The Internet Transfer Control is a great tool that lets you exploit the benefits of transferring information across the Internet:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Geographical distance is no longer a concern when you need to move information between two locations.<br><br></li>
<li>
The types of computers or software being used are no longer a concern when you transfer files from one company to another.<br><br></li>
<li>
The type of network being used to connect two computers doesn’t prevent you from sending information from one to another.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The availability of these features of the Internet, combined with the tremendous ease of use of the Internet Transfer Control in the Visual Basic environment, means that you have at your disposal a powerful tool for creating effective business applications. </p>
