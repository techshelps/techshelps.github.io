<b>KEVIN HOUSTOUN </b></p>
<p>
Kevin is a TMS Associate who spends part of his time developing, distributing, and supporting a range of Microsoft Windows–based software packages for niche markets. His first product was an office automation system for real estate agents selling and renting residential property. He originally wrote this product in Visual Basic 3 but has since ported it to 16-bit Visual Basic 4 and, more recently, to Visual Basic 5. He spends his remaining time advising companies on using Visual Basic. Kevin’s hobbies are best not listed in any book liable to be read by the easily offended. </p>
