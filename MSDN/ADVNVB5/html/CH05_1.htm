<p>
Microsoft Visual Basic 5 extends the object-oriented direction of Visual Basic 4. The benefits of object-oriented programming are well documented, but what modifications should you make to your programming style to get the most out of it? The Basic programming language is by design an all-purpose language, and it is still easy to write code in a non-object-oriented manner.</p>
<p>
<b>I</b>n this chapter, we will look at four standards, or rules, that you can apply in modifying your coding style and improving the quality of your code. We will look at how a disciplined, standards-based approach can make a genuine impact on the quality of your code. At the same time, these rules should enable you to quickly adopt a more object-oriented style of coding, more in keeping with the spirit and direction of Visual Basic 5.</p>
