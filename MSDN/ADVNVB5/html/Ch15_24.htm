<p>
Microsoft supplies two useful wizards with Visual Basic 5 that can make creating controls much easier. The ActiveX Control Interface Wizard, shown in Figure 15-10 on the following page, helps in the creation of a control’s interface and can also insert code for common properties such as <i>Font </i>and <i>BackColor</i>. The Property Page Wizard does a similar job for the creation of property pages to accompany your control. Once again, standard properties such as <i>Font </i>and <i>Colors </i>can be selected from the ready-made property pages. Using these wizards can prove invaluable in creating the controls and their property pages and also in learning the finer points in their design.</p>
<p>
You should use both these wizards: between them, they promote a consistency of design to both the properties of your controls and the user interface used to modify these properties. The example DateEdit control used throughout this section was created using both of these wizards. Any chapter about code reuse would be churlish if it failed to promote these wizards. Of course, no wizards yet created can control what you do with the user interface of the controls themselves!</p>
