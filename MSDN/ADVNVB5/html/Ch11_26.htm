Now that we’ve looked at how to incorporate sound and video into our applications and at methods of producing custom interfaces, we can put it all together and address one of the problem areas highlighted in the first section: computer-based training. We will look at how to use multimedia techniques to produce custom titles that can be mastered to CD and given to the users. With the cost of mastering CDs dropping so radically, this has become a cheap and efficient means of training because it saves valuable IT resources, allows users to learn at their own pace (and possibly on their own time), and is reusable.</p>
