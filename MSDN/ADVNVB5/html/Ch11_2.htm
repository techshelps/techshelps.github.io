<p>
The initial section of this chapter looks at ways you can help users get up to speed with your applications by using context-sensitive help as well as ways to support your applications.</p>
<p>
The next section will consider how you can create interfaces other than the multiple-document interface (MDI) that most business systems use today. Although in most cases the MDI is satisfactory, there may well be cases in which an alternative interface would better suit the application. We値l look at one such alternative, the single-document interface (SDI).</p>
<p>
Building on the material presented in the first two sections, we値l consider how multimedia and the user interface can assist with often expensive training requirements when a new system is deployed. We値l look at how you can create a computer-based training (CBT) system for your application by taking each of the elements that make up a CBT system and seeing how they can be implemented using the features of Visual Basic 5.</p>
<p>
We値l round off the chapter by considering other issues related to multimedia and the user interface in a commercial environment. As an example, we値l look at how to create a document-management system and how this system can be extended to include workflow.</p>
