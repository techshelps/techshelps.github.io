<p>
Early binding was introduced in Visual Basic version 4 and is better than late binding for several important reasons. Before talking about those reasons, though, let’s be sure that you understand the difference between early and late binding.</p>
<p>
With early binding, you declare the object type prior to using the object. For example, to early bind to an object, you would use something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Dim ObjTest As Test.CTest</code></pre>
<p>
With late binding, the object type is declared when the object is created, something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Dim ObjTest As Object
Set ObjTest = CreateObject(“Test.CTest”)</code></pre>
<p>
Here are some reasons you should use early binding:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Early binding checks all of the code against the syntax stored in the type library when you compile the executable or the Visual Basic code. Syntax errors are detected during compilation. This is not true with late binding or ActiveX control binding.<br><br></li>
<li>
Early binding is insensitive to the localized version of the products you are using. Late binding and control binding are sensitive to the localized version. For example, if a user is running the French version of Microsoft Word and a type library was not used, the French version’s commands will be required. So the <i>FicheOuvert </i>method will have to be used instead of the <i>FileOpen </i>method.<br><br></li>
<li>
Because control type and function checking is done at compile time and not at run time, the performance of early binding is significantly faster than the performance of late binding or control binding.</li>
