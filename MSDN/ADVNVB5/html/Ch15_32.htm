<p>
We’ve made only a few suggestions here—there are lots more. If you decide on a set of good habits and constantly practice and refine them, your organization will benefit because of the development time you’ll save, and you will benefit because you’ll need to do much less debugging. Each time you complete a project, review it and identify areas that you could have improved.</p>
<p>
Reusability is an issue that has to be supported by the business, designed by the designers, and coded by the programmers. Unless all sides commit to the goal of reusability, you will be doomed to continually rewrite most of your code.</p>
