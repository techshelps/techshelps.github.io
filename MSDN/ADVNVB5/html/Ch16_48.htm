<p>
As mentioned earlier, a key objective of the Pathfinder project is to prove to the business managers and to the IT teams that a business function can be delivered using the application architecture. Using the Pathfinder reduces the perceived risk substantially.</p>
<p>
The proof of concept must include thorough testing of the application architecture. Such testing will cover, for example, stress testing the architecture. The architecture should be proven to be a viable basis on which to develop the entire application. Proof of concept includes delivery of the business function into a simulation of a live environment by those who would normally deliver the application. It should be delivered to the user for testing. Difficulties in managing rapid development in the IT department and in the business will be highlighted. Prove that you can deliver. Prove it to the business management, to the technicians, and to the skeptics!</p>
