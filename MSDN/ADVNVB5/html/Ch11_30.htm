<h1><a name="thecbtsystem"></a>The CBT System</h1>
<p>
In this section, we will build a working CBT system, but without a lot of the bells and whistles that you’d associate with a commercial product. The intention here is to look at each of the components and see how it works, in effect concentrating on the methods and techniques.</p>
<p>
We’ll also look at the areas you need to extend to produce a commercial-quality system. The system on the CD is functional in that you can build and view project details, create and use hot spots on the project forms, and add some text for each form. These are the basic elements that would make up any comprehensive CBT system. You will find the code and all the supporting files on the CD in the CBT directory structure. If you want to play with this application, copy the files to your hard disk so that you can edit them. As with all the other applications in this chapter, the directory structure is significant and is used to avoid coding absolute paths into the application. For a commercial application, you’d probably create an install routine and allow the user to determine the path, although it would be sensible to keep the directory structure.</p>
