<p>
ActiveX controls, formerly called OLE controls, are standard user interface elements that allow you to assemble forms and dialog boxes rapidly. ActiveX controls also add functionality to Web pages on a company’s intranet or on the Internet.</p>
<p>
An ActiveX control is an in-process component that runs within the application process. Controls are ideal components to wrap up common reporting functionality. For example, using the RTF file format, you can wrap the open, close, print, and execute actions of a report into a control with a rich text box.</p>
<p class=indent>
<span class=blue><b>Tip</b></span>  When designing controls for the Internet, keep the executable code size as small as possible. This restriction is less relevant for an intranet because of the higher communication bandwidth available.</p>
