<i>It’s a funny thing about life; if you refuse to accept anything but the best, you very often get it.</i></p>

<b>Somerset Maugham</b></p>
<p>
A desire for quality and technical purity encourages a rigorous approach to development. Formal methods such as VDM (Vienna Development Method), Z, and B are rarely used in commercial development. But methods that promote rigor (such as SSADM) continue to have a high level of use. Do they work? They can work well in the hands of skilled project managers who know what to use and what to leave out for a specific project. In unskilled hands, the level of rigor applied tends to be higher than necessary, project costs soar, and schedules slip.</p>
<p>
In some organizations, the consequence of the failure of rigor is that business managers decide to do their own development. In others, hacking takes over. Visual Basic 3 was one of the main tools of the hackers. To continue to use this approach with Visual Basic 5 is at best a waste and at worst a disaster. The development process for a project should be decided by the project manager with the guidance of the analysts and designers. Prescribing a method from outside the project does not work. A Pathfinder approach provides a mechanism for understanding major projects before you commit large numbers of staff to them.</p>
