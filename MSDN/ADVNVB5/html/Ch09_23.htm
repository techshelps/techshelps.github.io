<p>
Depending on the nature of your system, your Visual Basic programs might read data that has been provided by another set of programs. Your system might even save data that will be read and used by another system. If either of these conditions applies to your system, besides testing your own applications with their own set of preprepared data, you should also strongly consider running your Year 2000 tests in conjunction with the tests being run on other systems that rely on your system or that your system relies on.</p>
<p>
The reason for such tests should be obvious. For example, suppose that as part of your analysis and conversion you decide to change the data structure of certain dates that are stored in a database. You insert preprepared test data into the database to test your newly converted Visual Basic system (having restructured the data types), and everything comes up roses. But if no one has changed the structure of the date fields in the system supplying the dates to the database, your system will be expecting one format of date but will receive another! The same goes for systems that your system is supplying data to.</p>
<p>
In short, communicate with the developers working on the systems providing your input, and communicate with the developers working on the systems relying on your output. (Your newly appointed Year 2000 coordinator should facilitate this communication.) Finally, test all systems side by side.</p>
<p>
In the big world of corporate IS, you can usually count the systems that are completely autonomous on one hand. So bang your heads together and get it right!</p>
