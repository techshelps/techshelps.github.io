<p>
What we all should have known, however, is that all these cool business objects are never going to cooperate “seamlessly” or even seamfully without an underlying infrastructure. Through almost all of its history, Visual Basic had been a good tool for allowing application programmers to concentrate on the business functionality of the application they were trying to build and ignore the lower-level technicalities of what they were doing. The best Visual Basic programmers soon get into the Windows API(s) or data access complexities. But mostly, Visual Basic allowed implementers to focus on achieving functional complexity rather than forcing on them a high level of technical complexity. That sounds like a polite way of saying that it allowed a lot of people to behave like cowboys—still, let it stand. All silver linings have a cloud, however, and the ease and rapidity of Visual Basic’s learning curve and its deceptively nontechnical approach of drawing windows on the screen soon led to deficiencies, usually structural, in systems. Such deficiencies are not troublesome when you have small systems, noncritical systems, or stand-alone systems. Even two-tier systems can live like this. But for big, critical corporate systems, structural inadequacies are the kiss of death. You’ll probably find that most of the chapters of this book, one way or another, are aimed at fixing or avoiding these problems, whether it be through error handling, coding standards, project management, data access, or sound technical solutions to common technical problems in the Visual Basic environment.</p>
