<p>
This book is geared toward two broad audiences. <i>Technical managers </i>responsible for planning, designing, and supporting Visual Basic applications should read it with a view to understanding what they can and can’t expect from the teams they are or will be managing and what capabilities Visual Basic 5 has. <i>Developers</i> responsible for designing, programming, and implementing Visual Basic applications within the corporate arena should study it to find out how other experts handle the common, yet often complex and frustrating, problems they are likely to encounter (or are already wrestling with).</p>
