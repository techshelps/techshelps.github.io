Since that day long ago, there have been many methods, even more methodologies, and, of course, many, many systems: structured methods, soft systems methods, rapid methods, engineering methods, information methods, prototyping methods, object-oriented methods, and dynamic methods. This proliferation is inextricably linked with the rapid advances of the technology base on which practical computing was founded. However, the outcome of all these methods has not changed: mediocre systems. Likewise, and as important, in a fulfillment of their own prophecies, neither have the inputs changed: mediocre staff. The false public promise of methods and methodologies (the private message was never made public) ensured that no special premium or reward would be vouchsafed to the exceptional practitioners and that the truly gifted would find no eager welcome. Methods homogenized the development of both systems and practitioners, actual and prospective.</p>

Yet more worrisome and damaging than this pervasive mediocrity is the neglect that design as a discipline has been subject to. Find a methodology book and look in the index for “design.” Now read all the topics mentioned. You’ll find that analysis is still confused with design and still overwhelms it as a topic. You will be hard-pressed to find a life cycle or a method that lists design as a separate stage—it will be either the analysis and design stage or the design and code stage in which you find design mentioned at all. Books and methods addressing design as a sole topic are equally rare.</p>
