<b>LAWSON DAVIES </b></p>
<p>
Lawson is a TMS Consultant who was born a Welshman six weeks after Sputnik. On his return from five years’ working and walking in the Highlands of New Guinea, he abandoned the stressful life of an itinerant teacher, novelist, and social parasite to enter the safe, comfortable mainstream world of client/server development, where he has chilled out for the last eight years. His areas of special interest are primarily design, real ale, system architecture, Islay malts, database connectivity, distributed systems, and the oeuvres of Brian Eno and Gary Glitter. </p>
