<b>MARK PEARCE</b></p>
<p>
Mark is a TMS Associate who has been programming professionally for the past 18 years, working mainly in the banking industry. In recent years, Mark has concentrated on the design and development of effective client/server systems. His interest in zero-defect software comes from a previous incarnation as a professional chess player, where one mistake can lose a significant sum of money and ruin a wonderful game. Mark’s current ambitions in life are to run a sub-2.30 marathon, juggle a Mills Mess for more than 1.5 seconds, and experience the perfect kiss—preferably all simultaneously. </p>
