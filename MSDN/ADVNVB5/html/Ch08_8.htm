<p>
I have no idea why some of these switches are used explicitly (on the compiler also), particularly since some are set to the default anyway. Perhaps some of the reasons for using these switches will become documented at some later date.</p>

<span class=blue><b>Note</b></span>  The Visual Basic 5 CD contains, in TOOLS\UNSUPPRT\TYPLIB, what appears to be the C/C++ compiler as supplied with Microsoft’s Visual C++ 4.1 (CL version 10.10, C1 version 10.10). I copied CL, C1, C2, and LINK off the CD and into a directory on my hard disk and successfully compiled the OUTARGS.C program shown earlier. It appears as if Visual Basic 5 might ship complete with the C compiler too!</p>
