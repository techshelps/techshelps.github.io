<b>JON BURN </b></p>
<p>
Jon, a TMS Associate, has been programming under Microsoft Windows since the mid-1980s. He always found C programming tough, so the introduction of Visual Basic made his job a lot easier. He’s been a fan ever since. Jon has worked on some retail software, such as the PagePlus DTP package, and a lot of custom software in the corporate environment. He has also taught programming and written various articles about it. He believes that if you’re going to program, you might as well do it right. Thinking about what is right keeps him from getting too comfortable. Jon spends as much time as possible at home with his wife and two sons. </p>
