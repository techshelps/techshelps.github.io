<p>
Instances of parameters unexpectedly changing their value result in bugs and are a lesser form of the global variable issue. To put it at its simplest, parameters changing their values are a side effect, and side effects trip up programmers.</p>
<p>
If I call the function</p>
<pre><code>Dim a, b 
a = f(b)</code></pre>
<p>
it is immediately apparent to me that <i>a</i> is likely to change, and probably <i>b</i> will not. But I cannot guarantee that without looking at the source code for the function <i>f</i>. This makes me place passing parameters by reference into the same category as user-defined types—they are not self-describing and do not fit well into the Automation framework.</p>
<p>
It is particularly unfortunate that the default parameter-passing convention is <i>ByRef</i>, because it means that you have to do extra typing to implement this rule. Because of backward compatibility, I think there is no chance of this being changed.</p>
