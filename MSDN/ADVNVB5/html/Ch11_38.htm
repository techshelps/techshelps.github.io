Having managed to scan and store your documents and catalog them on a backend database, the next logical step is to expand the functionality of the database to produce a workflow and job-tracking system. This can be achieved by creating jobs, which are made up of a series of steps, and then associating them with form types.</p>
<p>
A form can then be tracked and the current status determined by looking at the job step for the form. By linking users with the individual job steps, you can schedule and control the workflow. If you are also running Microsoft Exchange, you can use the MAPI controls that ship with Visual Basic 5 to notify the user that some action is required, directly out of the system.</p>
<p>
The diagram in Figure 11-12 illustrates this concept. Doc X arrives and is logged into the DPI/Workflow database. Job X is associated with this document, so a new instance of the job is created. SLD is the first person to take some action in this workflow, so an e-mail notification is sent. After some action, the step completion details are logged, and the system e-mails the next person in the workflow that step 2 is required. This continues until Job X for Doc X is complete. By time-stamping the entries in the job record, you can gather service level metrics (and much more).</p>

These are just a few ideas for using multimedia in a commercial environment. As with many emerging technologies, the takeup is slow at first, but as people become more familiar with its uses, they find new ways to use it.</p>
