<p>
Before we get our teeth too deeply into the Visual Basic way of programming, I think it’s worth reviewing the different levels of testing that apply to all software development projects regardless of the programming language or target platform.</p>
<p>
The nature of testing is so varied in its requirements that it is difficult to give generalized definitions. What is appropriate for a small (one-person or two-person) application is totally unsuitable for a large (twenty-person) development, whereas the amount of formality that accompanies a large project would slow down the delivery of a small application by a wholly unreasonable amount. With this in mind, I have tried where appropriate to illustrate the relative scale that is necessary at each stage.</p>
