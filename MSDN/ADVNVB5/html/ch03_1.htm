<p class=indent>
In this chapter, we’ll explore various methods for solving complex reporting issues. You’ll see that by using report formats suited to your company’s particular needs, you’ll be able to reduce training costs, development overhead, and the user’s need to maintain detailed knowledge of a myriad of applications and tools.</p>
<p>
The rapid advancement in hardware and software technology ensures that application development is in a continuous state of evolution. We’ve quickly progressed from monolithic character-based applications to state-of-the-art WYSIWYG ones. You need look no further than the advances in word processor offerings to see how the style, flexibility, and complexity of commercial applications have evolved in the space of a decade.</p>
<p>
Custom development has followed suit, thanks to the availability of powerful languages and a vast array of software tools the developer can use. While frequenting the local bar, I’ve occasionally heard drunken tales of how easily users are impressed with the bells and whistles they are given in a typical application demonstration. Enthusiastically, the developer in question might boast that he was able to awe his users simply by whipping together a couple of screens incorporating some clever graphics and a smattering of code. Such tales might contain a certain amount of truth; however, it’s unlikely that you would ever hear a developer make such claims about a user’s reporting requirement. In fact, a discussion of user reports is likely to sober up even the most hardened developer with painful flashbacks: the numerous times a report had to be redeveloped because it didn’t quite match the user’s requirement; a user’s scorn because of the inability to control the positioning of page breaks; worst of all, the inevitable user question, “I was able to produce this report in Microsoft Excel; why can’t you create an application to do the same?”</p>
<p>
This chapter aims to help you avoid some of these unpleasant experiences by illustrating ways of using the latest technologies in Microsoft Visual Basic 5 to your reporting advantage.</p>
