of Design Deficit Are Detailed</h1>
<p>
These days it seems that almost every widely observed and yet poorly understood symptom or set of symptoms is labeled as some pseudoscientific “syndrome.” I would therefore like to nominate “design deficit syndrome,” or DDS, as the official nomenclature for the wealth of mediocre and poor systems that as an industry we regularly deliver to our customers and that achieve their mediocrity or paucity from a simple lack or impoverishment of design.</p>
<p>
Having come up with a new name, I’ll next identify the symptoms of systems suffering from DDS:
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Don’t scale<br><br></li>
<li>
Don’t perform<br><br></li>
<li>
Don’t flex<br><br></li>
<li>
Are difficult or inelegant to use or they don’t get used<br><br></li>
<li>
Are difficult and costly to maintain</li>
</ul>
<p>
And now come the descriptions of the symptoms.</p>
